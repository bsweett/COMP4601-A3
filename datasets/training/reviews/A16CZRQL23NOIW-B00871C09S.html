Among the three, Hitchcock was possibly the coldest but his poignacy was always conceived by the Hitchcock`s fans as a boutade.<br /><br />Hitchcock involves us in this deligthful satyre with all the discrete elegance and extreme good manners. Don' t ever consider  our starring is a vulgar Peeping Tom. How can you dare?  He is simply a man who is wound and unable to displace, and by this cause his only hobby consists just in taking a little bit around here and there. The illusion through the window is basically the same experience between the viewer and the screen. Window and screen mean the possibility of watching other different realities from the other side of the street.<br /><br />Someway Hitchcock suggestively reminds us but always keeping a discrete distance .<br /><br />But that hazardous Peeping Tom activity has its risks and demands its prize. This occurs when he is the involuntary eyewitness of a murder. And suddenly our beloved friend becomes hunted due its hobby.<br /><br />The rest runs for you my dear reader. A love affair is the secondary argumental line and the huge stage of several open windows seem to work out as a multiple stage. So the camera is a nervous eye until the moment our hero is watched by the assasin. The camera wil be introspective from this moment, and in this case it will be an impotent and mude witness of an unfair and furious human chase.<br /><br />Only Hitchcock knew to handle with these codes as a real magician showing his new tricks.<br /><br />Stewart is simply perfect in this role. Magnificent restoration, superb photograph and as always Bernard Hermann's score is another invisible actor in this cat and mouse game.<br /><br />Voil&aacute;!</p></body></html>

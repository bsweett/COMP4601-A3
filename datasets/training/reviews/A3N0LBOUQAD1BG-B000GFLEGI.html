<meta name="summary" content="Another installment from Romero..."></head><body><p>Unlike Night, Dawn or Day of the Dead, by the time we view Land of the Dead the zombies are in control of most of the world. Well there's one fairly large city surrounded by high walls where some humans live, there's a leader named Kaufman (Dennis Hopper, "Speed"), who has his personal soldiers that keep people in line. This city is like any post apocalyptic place would be, there's the usual upper class, middle class and lower aka poor class.<br /><br />People are tired of Kaufman's reign of tyrany and there's a movement brewing to overthrow his control of the city. But despite all this the humans are surviving, however the zombies have a plan thanks to somehow gaining some intelligence and have a leader of sorts who gets the masses together to march on the city, break in and feast on the population.<br /><br />I've already put more effort into the description of this film than the filmmakers put into the movie itself, cause its a pretty boring, the acting is ok I guess, though seeing Hopper in crap like this is just sad. The zombies aren't even worth rooting for in this flick, its clearly obvious where its going from the first few minutes, there's zero tension or scares and the scenes near the end with some kind of truce between the good guys and the zombies is just laughable. * out of 4 stars.</p></body></html>

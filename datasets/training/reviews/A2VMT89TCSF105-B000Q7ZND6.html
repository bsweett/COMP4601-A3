<meta name="summary" content="Constantine the not-so-great"></head><body><p>Is this movie a joke? A psychic guy running around in LA, killing demons with a crucifix-shaped gun. At one point, he kills a whole bunch with the aid of holy water...coming out from the sprinkler system! A Black voodoo priest called Papa Diavolo or something to that effect. Lucifer is on bad terms with his own son, named Mammon. The archangel Gabriel has a fall out with God and looses his wings. And no-no-no, you can't commit suicide, because if you do, you automatically go to Hell. Chain smoking is another sure method. And Heaven looks like...the Manhattan skyline!<br /><br />Once again, is this a joke?<br /><br />"Men in Black II" were better.</p></body></html>

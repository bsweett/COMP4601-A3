<meta name="summary" content="Watching movies doesn't do anything."></head><body><p>I've really become skeptical of the extent to which films can affect change.<br /><br />Heres what we should do:<br /><br />(I'm assuming YOU are not a Right-wing dummy, blinded by hate of Micheal Moore and hopelessly ignorant about how our economic system and politics hurt the American people. "The market" doesn't solve everything. Quite the contrary.)<br /><br />OK. After watching this documentary your going to feel upset. And you should. If you don't feel anything -- immediately make an appointment to see a doctor. A shrink actually. Because you might be a sociopath. Well, if your like a shockingly large number of Americans, nevermind. You ain't got the money to see a shrink and even if you have health insurance in all probability your not covered. Good luck.<br /><br />After watching this film, get other people to watch it. Watch it with other people and talk about it.<br /><br />And then TAKE ACTION. Do something. Do many things if you have the time after working your butt off all day.<br /><br />Micheal Moore made a great film. It's arguably even his best. His role is to spread the word and reveal the ugly, dysfunctional, mean, dark side of America. And he does his job well and in personal and entertaining fashion. The thing is, all the great documentaries you watch, and articles and books you read, don't add up to nothing if all we do is sit around and whine about it.<br /><br />So, get up and do something. Write Congress. Support candidates that will work to change things. Support groups and organizations that are working to change the health care system in America anyway you can. And we should see what we can do in our private life helping out neighbors and folks in our city that do not receive adequate care that would otherwise help them to lead a more healthy and dignified life. I don't mean to preach, but "Sicko" was in the theaters and is out on DVD, it got a nod from the Academy, and so what?</p></body></html>

It's a true saga, like the Lord Of The Rings!<br /><br />What moved me most was how each of the four children & teens grew, as individuals, and as a family unit. It's so easy to be selfish and only think about one's own needs. It's refreshing to see characters not only being concerned with each others well being, but also with the the community-at-large. One, which is so incredibly alien, it takes a lot of courage to care!<br /><br />In the world of Narnia, these four young people have real power! Their decisions have incredible consequences! One choice is to take risks, the other to retreat into safety and comfort. The adults in the audience, I'm sure, can identify with this tug-of-war. This quandary effects us all at some point in our lives.<br /><br />Another theme addressed is War. The opening scene shows the bombing of London during World War 2. I knew someone who actually lived through this experience as a child. It left lifelong scars. In the very beginning we see train loads of children being evacuated to family, friends, or even benevolent strangers in the much safer countryside. I said to myself, this is what war is really about: desperation and separation. It brought tears to my eyes. If anyone had experienced what my English friend did, first hand, as a child, they would think twice before starting or supporting war, period!<br /><br />While a war is fought in Narnia, this one is to prevent the collapse of civilization, at the hands of evil geniuses, just like in Lord Of The Rings or World War 2. Perhaps, if that was the standard the human race could agree on to wage war, then this ancient scourge would, indeed, finally become a thing of the past!<br /><br />The filmmakers should be congratulated for bringing a fairly complex story to the big screen with dignity and inspiration. I'm sure C.S. Lewis would be proud!<br /><br />P.S. I saw this magnificent film a second time, and I'm glad I did! The feelings of elation and awe are much appreciated! Memo to Hollywood: Start making more movies which are uplifting and your bottom line will uplift, too!</p></body></html>

After she dumps him the taxi driver decides to garner her attention by attempting to shoot the politician in cold blood. The other plot of the movie focuses on the DeNiro character discovering a young prostitute (played by Jodie Foster) and his attempts to get her pimp away from her. The movie is well-known for its use of firearms and the line "You talkin' to me?" The film is violent, especially the last moments of the film, but this kind of motion picture had to be made to show the seediest side of New York City and how people survive in a metropolis. The movie garnered 4 Oscar nods including ones for Best Picture, Best Actor for DeNiro, and Best Supporting Actress for Foster. This set includes a "Making-of Documentary" which is informative and entertaining with interviews with the cast and crew. The American Film Institute listed "Taxi Driver" as "One Of The Best Films Of All Time!".</p></body></html>

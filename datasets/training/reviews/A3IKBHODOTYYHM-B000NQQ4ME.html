<meta name="summary" content="Fast-paced, original action film"></head><body><p>An enjoyable aspect of Mel Gibson's Apocolypto is that it is not your typical action film. It boasts no real big star names, and doesn't fall in love with itself like some films do. It simply tells a story. It could have been just another brainless action flick, but instead strives to illustrate the essence of one man's attempts at survival while using a Mayan civilization as the setting.  One tribe's fate is in jeopardy when the unthinkable happens: they become enslaved and the targets of a ritual sacrifice.<br /><br />To get this point over with, the movie is quite grisly, barbaric, graphic or whatever other word which successfully describes a lot of blood and death. There are scenes of some of Jaguar Paw's fellow tribesmen being beheaded, as well as many scenes of warriors being speared, impaled or killed in various other ways. There are even scenes of corpses rotting. I'm not one who relishes the idea of watching this type of thing, but I don't think that the barbarism in the film debunks the real story at hand. Another way to say this is: there is a point to the violence, and it in no way effects or tries to "steal the show" of the film's real essence: the struggle of Jaguar Paw (and others) to escape and get back to their land.<br /><br />What Gibson is able to achieve in many parts of this film is a fast-paced, yet mysterious and eerie atmosphere. There are moments, like at the film's beginning, when the quiet tranquility of the tribe's home is juxtaposed by the intrusion and ruthlessness of the other clan. There are also moments when Jaguar Paw is frantically running for his life in the brush, and then moments where he is quietly hiding with others hunting within feet of him, using his instincts as a warrior for escape. Also, the scenery of the forest really intensifies the feeling of the unknown, or danger lurking just beyond the next step. There are many chase scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat, and you feel yourself rooting for Jaguar Paw to make it back to his wife and kid as the rain starts pouring.<br /><br />If you can forgive Gibson for his shady reputation and just take in this film, I think you will find his film quite original, and scenery impressive for the film's mood. It was refreshing to see a film that tries to be different, original and a little bit intelligent to boot, something you seldom see in action films anymore.</p></body></html>

Picture is a little grainy, but it is not overwhelming.<br />*Includes some featurettes, deleted scenes, and a gag reel.<br />*The movie itself has a very good filming style.  The cameramanship is splendid.  It is particularly interesting how the camera shows the violence in a way that is not too graphic; I think its better that way.<br />*As I recall hearing, this is the first horror film shot entirely in daylight.<br />*This film does have its scary, freaky moments.  Some parts genuinely thrilled me.  It also had some dry witty moments as well, and some upbeat parts that provides some contrast to an otherwise dreary film.<br />*The premise is interesting (even if it is never fully explained what or why all of this is happening).  The script/story has some interesting concepts, such as the relationship between science, math, nature, and humanity. Possibly some allegories between the characters and modern society.  The story is not bad.<br />*Most people seem to think that the characters/writing/acting is horrid.  I don't really see why; the writing is just as good and interesting as any other movie by M. Night Shyamalan.  The characters are emotional, expressive, and rather touching.  The acting seemed good to me.<br />*The settings are used quite effectively.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Not for kids or the extremely squeamish; contains some swearing and violence, including one or two bloody scenes (rated R).<br />*The plot is kind of weird, and ends a little abruptly.<br />*One or two laughable moments (although most people seem to think there are lots of laughable moments).<br />*Slowly paced (although not as bad as some of the other Shyamalan movies, like "The Village").<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*It is never fully revealed what causes the events or why.  I think it's good that way, because it corresponds to the movie's idea that people can never truly explain natural phenomenon.  But it may also be a dissapointment if you were expecting a straight answer.<br />*Other aspects of the characters and plot are never fully revealed either, and can only be found out by paying close attention or by watching the extras on the disc.<br /><br />Wow, this movie sure has a bad wrap, and I don't know why.  Were you expecting another "6th Sense" movie (again)? Then go watch "The 6th Sense." "The Happening" is another totally different title in Shyamalan's repertoire, and shouldn't really be put in the same league as his first breakthrough film.  This one has no major plot twist.  It has a straightforward story.  It has no oscar-award-winning performances.  It's simply an apocalyptic thriller, on the same level as Spielburg's "War of the Worlds" or Frank Darabont's "The Mist." To say that this is anything more is obviously a misconception, but I don't think it deserves to be considered something less.  To do so would be to say that Shyamalan is as bad of a director as Uwe Boll, and I don't think he deserves that.<br /><br />I thought that this was just as good of a movie as anything else by Shyamalan (although no better than anything else he made either).  I think it had some interesting elements, ideas, characters, and camerawork.  Some parts of it may even make you think (but it is not wholly obvious in the script; you have to really think about it in order to appreciate it).  If you have any interest in his work or intelligent filmmaking in general, give it a try by all means.</p></body></html>

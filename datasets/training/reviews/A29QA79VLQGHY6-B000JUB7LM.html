Check out the extra-features undercard: An embarrassing roundtable session with Eastwood and his stars; a leftover promo piece; talking-head bits with the producers; and a trailer. It adds up to about an hour of extras -- a puny showing for any major film on DVD, much less the most honored movie of the year. Feel free to throw beer and popcorn.<br /><br />As for the main event, there's still reason to cheer: "Million Dollar Baby" looks and sounds like, well, a million bucks. The film's flat color scheme comes across suitably downbeat with its queasy greens, pale blues and nicotine grays. The widescreen images unspool in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1), as shot. The Dolby Digital 5.1 audio delivers the body blows with authority; the subwoofer shovels out foreboding and menace. The surround arena seems mostly abandoned until the big fight scenes, when it comes to life with a jolt. There is no DTS option.<br /><br />The extras deliver almost nothing on how the boxing was shot or staged -- a shame because this "Baby" delivered some of the most visceral fight scenes since "Raging Bull." (MGM's recent DVD of "Raging Bull" got it right, with exhaustive breakdowns of Robert De Niro's bouts.)<br /><br />Those seeking an old-fashioned boxing drama that refuses to be tied up by sentiment are directed to Robert Wise's 1949's "The Set-Up," released last summer by Warner.</p></body></html>

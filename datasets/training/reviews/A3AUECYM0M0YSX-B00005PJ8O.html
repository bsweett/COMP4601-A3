<meta name="summary" content="Likely the best Hollywood war film ever made"></head><body><p>...And I don't mean "Hollywood" as an insult.  This *is* a glossy Hollywood big budget epic.  That's not inherently bad.  But for a while there was talk of John Wayne getting the role of Patton.  Seriously, can you imagine that?  It makes me shudder.  "I want you buckeroos to know that no pilgrim ever won a war by dying for his country.  You better believe it or you're dead where you stand, son."  God help us.  Fortunately, saner heads prevailed.  Fortunately, studio executives actually decided to go with the one script (six were written) that was closest to the truth and didn't glorify or exaggerate.  Fortunately, George C. Scott existed to play the part.  Who else could have been Patton?  I don't think there was or is another actor.  He was born for the role.<p>What makes this film special is indeed how they stayed so close to the facts, starting with the masterful script, thoroughly researched and written by a young USC grad named Francis Ford Coppola.  Then they combined the great script with great care in how the people, the places, and events looked, down to the smallest details in costuming and set design.  Yes, a few ugly facts are glossed over, such as Patton's anti-semitism (actually not at all uncommon in the military then), but overall this film plays straight and fair with the facts, and you realize how dull history was the way they taught it to us in high school.  The performances are all spot-on, with Malden's Bradley the perfect warm foil for the imperious George S., and Michael Bates a dead ringer for Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.<p>The transfer to DVD is special, with beautiful color and hardly a nick or scratch.  If you've only seen this one on network TV or old videotapes, you've never really seen Patton before.  The wide-screen presentation allows us to savor the compositions of some really extraordinary shots--all the battle sequences are amazing in how they are staged.  (They used the Spanish army, because they now own all our surplus WWII combat equipment.)  <p>Unfortunately, 20th Century Fox did find a way to blow it with this DVD--sort of.  The original issue was a 2-disc set, the second DVD featuring an excellent documentary on the making of the film and the real George S. Patton, with comments by the director, producer, and George C. Scott, and others.  It also has a track of just Jerry Goldsmith's wonderful score (beautifully restored in the film, btw).  My only complaint was the documentary was not long enough--a subject as fascinating as Patton, and the making of Patton, deserves two hours, not one.  Now Fox has taken the two-disc Patton out of circulation and replaced it with this version from the "Fox War Series"--only one disc, and for not many dollars less than the original double-set.  I'd advise anyone who really care about this movie and loves DVD extras to cruise eBay for copies of the 2DVD Patton, as they do pop up frequently.  That's the best way to own this film.  The single-disc is a poor substitute.</p></body></html>

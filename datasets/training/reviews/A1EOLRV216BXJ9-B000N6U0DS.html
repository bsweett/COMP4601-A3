I have heard my friends praising Jaden Smith's performance. Yet it's the story and Will Smith that grabbed my attention.<br /><br />It's sometimes uneasy to see how Chris Gardner made ends meet in the movie and he did it all for his son. The good work of charity organizations, the people who responded to his phone calls and bought his scanners helped. (I begin to think of all those promotion phone calls I turned down.) Chris's sheer determination, perseverance and guts to  survive his 6-month internship were again not an easy act to follow. It took every bit of his intelligence to pull it off. This is a feel good movie to make us reflect how much we already have; how a little help can make a big difference to others' lives. A thought provoking movie indeed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bruce Willis is better than ever!  A fun continuation of the series..."></head><body><p>The original Diehard was a groundbreaking movie. It featured an breakout performance by Bruce Willis, it had great action, a fun plot, and a romantic twist. Diehard had two unique characteristics that I believe made the first two films so successful, and hindered the third in the series. First, there was a problem only John McClain could solve. In the skyscraper, and then in the airport, the police, FBI and military were on the scene, but for whatever reason, only John McClain could be the hero. If it wasn't for McClain, the bad guys would win. Second, McClain was motivated by love. In the first film, his wife was being held hostage, in the second, she was in a jet that was about to run out of fuel. McClain acted not only to save others, but to save his wife. The third Die Hard abandoned both of those plot points and wasn't as good because of it.<br /><br />Live Free or Die Hard is out some 13 years after the third movie. Willis still looks great. The action is great. The dialogue (in the unrated version) is what you'd expect. The movie opens with McClain being asked to escort a computer hacker to the FBI for questioning. McClain shows up and must immediately fight off heavily armed thugs. From there on, its action scene after action scene as McClain and the hacker (played by Justin Long) must avoid the bad guys. The bad guys, led by Timothy Oliphant have shut down the entire East Coast. They've disrupted traffic lights, trains, Wall Street, and power grids. No one knows what is going on. Except perhaps John McCain, who is sitll escorting the hacker that just might have a clue as to what is going on, and how to stop it. This movie succeeds because McClain is once again forced to be the hero.<br /><br />While the FBI and Homeland Security have to deal with the larger problems of the entire computer systems of the country being disrupted, McClain has the advantage of being with a guy that might just know what was going on. McClain charges on, never one to stop and wait for help. The movie sets up action scenes after action scenes, and after awhile they become repetitive. Even so, they do actually get better and better. McClain's daughter Lucy, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, substitutes for the wife as the damsel in distress McClain must save. Having to save his daughter adds just enough of emotion and depth to counter all of the non-stop testosterone.<br /><br />This movie won't go down as one of the best ever. How can it when it is the fourth in the series? But it features one of the best action heroes of the last twenty years showing that he is still on top of his games. Justin Long is solid as the wise cracking computer hacker that is with Willis for the ENTIRE movie. Oliphant is menancing as a bad guy even if his motivation isn't clear until the end. The rest of the cast doesn't make an impression. Fans of Die Hard and Willis should enjoy this movie. It is fun, fast-paced and violent.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dull and not particularly frightening"></head><body><p>The buildup is very slow in Wolf Creek, allowing the viewers to get to know the three central characters before things go bad for them. But even with almost an hour of buildup and establishment, I still felt no connection to the characters. The characters themselves were just not that interesting to begin with so when the action picks up, I couldn't find any pity or horror towards them.<br /><br />As for the horror part of this film, well, lets just say it is nonexistant. Perhaps for those who frighten easily, you may find this disturbing and creepy, but in reality, it wasn't all that scary or chilling. Supposedly based on a true story, it just doesn't work onscreen, especially since there were pretty much no witnesses from the original crime, so most of it feels made up, hence, making it less than frightening.<br /><br />The violence and gore are mediocre, not even remotely comparable to similar torture films, like any of the Saw films, or even Hostel, which is also slow to pick up. Again, for those squeemish people, it may be disturbing, but I felt none of that. The characters themselves suffer from the familiar clich&eacute;; doing stupid stuff in a horror movie. Some of it is eye roll inducing. There is one gag that is actually pretty sick, called 'head on a stick', which works really well in the scene, but the event leading right up to that is pretty ridiculous and disbelieving.<br /><br />The acting is pretty decent by everyone and the film has a sort of Indie look to it, but that is all it has going for it. There really is no actual plot besides the one that picks up about 3/4 of the way in. Just way too slow and lacking in actual scares and tention. There are PLENTY of slasher fics out there that are creepier than this one. Skip it.</p></body></html>

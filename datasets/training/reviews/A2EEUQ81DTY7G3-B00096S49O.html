<meta name="summary" content=""I deal with getting people together who like one another""></head><body><p>This movie is an absolute train wreck, a cumbersome, extremely talky affair, full of clunky stops and starts, and exhibiting all self-conscious ramblings of a particularly awkward first date. Dull, tedious, badly acted, and ploddingly directed, Hitch dedicates a full 120 minutes to the hilarious comic notion that men make bad dancers and that gorgeous model-like women will want them regardless of whether they are overweight, flabby bumbling fools.<br /><br />This appalling and condescendingly pedestrian film stars Will Smith who oozes considerable charm as Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, a successfully smooth Manhattan date doctor who, for a reasonable fee, will coach his fellow men, no matter how meek or mild, how to woo the woman of their dreams.<br /><br />Lately Hitch has had his hands full coaching timid corporate accountant Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), who's head-over-heels smitten with Allegra Cole (supermodel-actress Amber Valletta), a glamorous socialite who normally wouldn't give the likes of Albert a second glance, but is inexplicably attracted to him when he stands up for her, lambasting the corporate lawyers who are in charge of her inheritance.<br /><br />Although Hitch has never truly recovered from having his heart broken back in college, he suddenly finds himself attracted to Sara Melas (a dreadful Eva Mendes), a gossip reporter for the New York Standard tabloid who makes a living covering and uncovering the love affairs of the rich and famous but has yet to find her own Mr. Right.<br /><br />A conflict soon arises when the date doctor's prescription for love and happiness doesn't work quite as well, especially when he tries to woo the beautiful Sara. Hitch has to learn the tricky art of just being himself, rather than the person he thinks women want to see. When he tries to be all cool and smooth, he always ends up embarrassing himself and going home alone.<br /><br />Nothing in this story is remotely credible or involving. The romance feels stretched, strained, and overwrought and the story seems to take at least three months to get to its point. Apart from James, who instills his performance with a kind of wry comic irony, the rest of the cast is absolutely terrible, with the bad acting honors particularly reserved for Mendes who prances around with a mixture of strained embarrassment and forced, artificial emotion.<br /><br />There's absolutely no reason a silly romantic comedy should stretch out to an entire two hours, particularly when there's so little going on. Director Andy Tennant lets the pace run slow and slack, with too many scenes that are sluggish and leaden, and when they should be swift, and speedy. Mendes and Smith have next to no chemistry together and their emotional cues feel affectless and strained.<br /><br />On the positive side, Tennant demonstrates a good eye for locations, and gets the colorful Manhattan backdrop just right. He also chooses a number of fresh downtown venues and uses the waterfront along the Central Business district to great effect. Mike Leonard June 05.</p></body></html>

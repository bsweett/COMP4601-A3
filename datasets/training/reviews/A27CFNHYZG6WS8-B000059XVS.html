<meta name="summary" content="A model historical epic - dark, satirical, perversely humble"></head><body><p>'Lawrence of Arabia' is more than just a large-scale desert adventure - it's not David Lean's fault he spawned the detritus of modern cinema in the shape of Spielberg, Lucas and their offspring. <p>Like his best epics, it is a thorough, ironic, viciously satiric look at different types of Englisheness, and at the cynical legacy of colonialism. It is a dismantling of the myth of T. E. Lawrence - any heroic successes are either filmed from a distance, minimised by context or not shown at all; triumph is usually quickly followed by bathos or defeat; we see how the myth is created and exploited, how much the man differs from, and fails to live up to, it. <p>It is a film full of classical irony Lawrence himself might have appreciated - a man who nearly kills himself trying to save a man he must later execute; a man who wants to escape one class-ridden society that would dismiss him as 'illegitimate', only to see his dreams destroyed in a land where class differences are murderous. <p>Lawrence, though coming from an opposite viewpoint, is a close relative of Colonel Nicholson in 'Bridge on the River Kwai', a man whose very English faithfulness to a code turns him into a traitor and murderer. <p>The first, longer part of 'Arabia' is especially magnificent, daring the audience to submit to its pace, to feel the monotonous vastness and unknowability of the desert. By focusing on shadows, the swirls of sand bordering the immovable smoothness of dunes, the phantom introduction of Ali, the supernatural power of dust-storms, Lean captures the spiritual sense inherent to Lawrence, and hostile to the narrow-minded bureaucracy of the Army and Empire; these shots, and the many sequences where huge armies become tiny patterns against the awesome desert geometry, seem closer to abstract art than the pomp of the usual historical epic. <p>So rich and detailed is the first half, that Lean seems to have gotten bored, and the second is a mostly dispiriting sequence of noisy, cluttered crowd scenes that is much closer to Lucas and Spielberg, with barely an interesting, never mind beautiful shot. Of course, this could simply be replicating the growing disillusion of Lawrence himself.</p></body></html>

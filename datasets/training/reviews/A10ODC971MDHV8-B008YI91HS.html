<meta name="summary" content="Jurassic Park"></head><body><p>Based on Michael Crichton's best-seller, this nerve-jangling monster movie takes time to gather steam, but once it does, look out! Groundbreaking computer effects make dinosaurs frighteningly real, and once more, Spielberg knows just how to build tension, inch by gut-wrenching inch. The initial Tyrannosaurus scene is downright terrifying (particularly the first time around), along with those raptors in the kitchen. Whole cast is fine (including Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Knight in supporting roles), but make no mistake: the dinos are the real stars. Original feature is vastly superior to the two sequels.</p></body></html>

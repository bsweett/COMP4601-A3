<meta name="summary" content="Dear Editor, This is the Zodiac Speaking"></head><body><p>The worldview of Director David Fichner has always been a dour and dark one. From his first big splash of the wildly underrated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000ILDF">Alien 3</a> and the the genre redefining <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000050FEN">Se7en</a>, he approaches the noir of details like few others. However, this attention to the underbelly takes a toll on "Zodiac," a serial killer film that spends more time on the soul killing of the killer's trackers than on the killer itself.<br /><br />The movie is basically a two-parter, with the first detailing real-life San Francisco Chronicle reporter Paul Avery (an animatedly off-center Robert Downey Jr, giving early glimpses at his soon to exlpode comeback), an SF Homicide Detective David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and the killer as he picks off his victims in a rather non-sensationalist manner. The victims pile up and the city is thrown into paranoia, Avery and Toschi become obsessed with catching this modern-day Jack The Ripper. When he stays constantly one step ahead of capture and cunningly taunts his pursuers, everyone involved begins to spiral down. Once Avery suspects he is in the killer's cross-hairs, he no longer can report and soon becomes another kind of victim.<br /><br />That's when "Zodiac" lurches into a lumbering and poorly paced second half. Editorial Cartoonist and real-life author of this film's source book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425212181">Zodiac</a>, Robert Graysmith becomes inexplicably obsessed with the killer and begins to pick up where everyone else gave up. The problem is that Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) was just incidental to the first half of the film, and he was more annoying than purposeful. When he blossoms into this full-blown super-snoop, it barely seems plausible. And given that almost all the main characters from the first 90 minutes have disintegrated in their failure to apprehend Zodiac, the movie becomes Gyllenhaal's to carry.<br /><br />As Graysmith's obsession to the case becomes more neurotic, freneticism takes over and paranoid raves/rants/red herrings begin to overwhelm the character and the movie. Gyllenhaal pounding on Detective Toschi's window at midnight in the pouring rain was almost cringe inducing, as was the claustrophobic basement scene with the former film-house owner. Graysmith, like the others chasing The Zodiac ahead of him, soon gets pulled into the vortex with unsavory results. Yet in the first part of the film, there were multiple people getting torn apart in this investigative black hole, making "Zodiac" palpable. Graysmith's trip down the cliff is tedious and, frankly, unbelievable.<br /><br />While the grim circumstances are played to a fair historical accuracy and with Fichner's customery cool manner, a little judicious editing might have trimmed this to a more palatable film. There are too many detours and sidelines, making "Zodiac" something close to a documentary than a drama, which leaves you without any good guys or bad guys. Towards the end, I just wanted Graysmith to STFU and finish his book, and couldn't even root for the anti-hero suspect (a creepy John Carroll Lynch), because anyone worth cheering for was now soul-dead. The final credit postlogue told the story of just how deeply the players were all affected, but "Zodiac" is primarily about the victims the murderer let live; Toschi, Avery and Graysmith, and how he killed them all the same.</p></body></html>

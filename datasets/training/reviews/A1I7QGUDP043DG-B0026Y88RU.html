When the brutal killing of a young father unleashes a plan for revenge, it's hard to tell who is being played for a fool and why. I love it when the bad guys get jerked around! Bruce Willis plays a hit man with a heart, but who can still make pre-meditated murders go so smooth it's nearly poetic. There are some kinky sex scenes, but they aren't thrown in haphazardly. Lucy Liu's character is a good sidebar, playing a coroner who tries her hand at unraveling a string of clues based on what she's learned from detective shows. What she doesn't realize is she's putting her own life at risk by getting involved in a plan years in the making that will end up in bloodshed.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

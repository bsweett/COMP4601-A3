<meta name="summary" content="Suspend the brain and have fun with Transporter 2"></head><body><p>Set your brain on park and get set to enjoy the further exploits of Frank Martin, the taciturn but very capable driver/transporter. In this sequel, Frank (Jason Statham) does a favor for a friend and agrees to chauffer around a young kid of a wealthy family  for a month. During that time, he grows fond of the boy and his attractive mother (Amber Valletta), which doesn't bode well for the hired thugs who kidnap the lad. The bad guys are formidable, the most deadly of whom are an imposing muscleman (Shannon Briggs), a beautiful but deranged and trigger-happy woman (Kate Nauta), and their vicious leader, the unscrupulous Gianni (Alessandro Gassman). But, this time, they picked the wrong victim to mess with when they chose someone under the care of the Transporter.<br /><br />This sequel, set in colorful Miami, is better than the first film. The plot is simple, even if the villain's master scheme is a bit convoluted, involving a kidnapping, a 24-hour virus, and the boy's father infecting the delegates of a drug enforcement conference. There's even a tiny, tiny subplot about the attraction between Frank and the boy's hot mom. But make no mistake,  this movie is all about Frank Martin and his talent to brutally kick heinie.<br /><br />The stunts are preposterous but very entertaining in their implausibility. In fact, the over-the-top outrageousness of the stunts is one of the things I appreciated about the film. The film makers wholeheartedly went for it. The manner in which Frank disposes of the car bomb, the ridiculousness of the vehicular stunts (especially early on, involving the police), and the eye-popping martial arts flavored fight scenes overwhelmed me to the point where I just relaxed, gave in, and then really got into the whole nutsy premise.<br /><br />Jason Statham, with his no-nonsense look and curt British accent, is impressive. Often, during the film, I noticed men in his vicinity who seemed to be taller than he was, but this, in no way, diminishes his character's aura of invincibility. He brings his natural grace, athleticism, and a personalized fighting style to his role as he Jackie Chans his way thru the baddies, utilizing as weapons various furnitures, fire extinguishers, and one very effective water hose nozzle. It's worth mentioning that Statham does the brunt of his stunts here.<br /><br />The supporting cast is serviceable. Beautiful Amber Valletta as the lonely mother is in that thankless role of looking anguished and tormented for most of the movie. Matthew Modine blandly blends in the background as the work-obsessed husband who likes to  disparage his wife. Even the lead villain Alessandro Gassman doesn't contribute much except for some token gestures and words of menace. Shannon Briggs needs to stick with boxing and go for a heavyweight title soon. Francois Berleand returns as the policeman Tarconi but is cast in the flick only to serve as a deux-ex-machina within the Miami police department and feed Frank precious info. I felt he was wasted here. The two supporting standouts are Kate Nauta as the psychologically unstable killer chick who stalks around in her scanties as she blazes her laser-designated weaponry with the contrail effects. Now, she's fun to watch in all her hot insanity. Hunter Clary as the boy Jack is endearing, and it's too bad he only has several scenes, the bulk of which is early in the film.<br /><br />Side A of the disc contains the full-screen version as well as these extra features: the 4 minute long "Making of Transporter 2" featurette, a 10 minute long "Making the Music" (film soundtrack) featurette, and a brief bloopers reel, and if you press the Inside Look button on the main menu, there's a cool trailer for the upcoming Night Watch movie. Side B has the widescreen version, as well as 4 extended and 3 deleted scenes.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first Transporter, you'll love Transporter 2. It's 87 minutes of mindless, ridiculous fun. It won't change the world for the better, but, at least, it's 87 minutes that you won't wish you had back. And if you love Transporter 2, then you gotta check out Crank. Now I'm off to see how much an Audi A8L W12 costs. I'm tired of my Mercury Topaz.</p></body></html>

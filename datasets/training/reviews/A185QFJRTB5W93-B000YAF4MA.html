It is the same as every other "what-to-do-when-you-know-you're-going-to-die" movie.  Nicholson seems to be trying to recreate his "As Good As It Gets" character.  All these things aside, this really is a good movie at it's core.  It is still well done and worth watching.  Anyone who has lost someone to the scourge of cancer will be touched.  Don't expect anything drastically new, but do expect a quality film.</p></body></html>

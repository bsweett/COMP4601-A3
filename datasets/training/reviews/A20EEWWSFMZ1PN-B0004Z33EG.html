This is the circumstance in which we find John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) Vietnam vet.  Wandering around in his old field jacket he had the misfortune to bump into, of all people the local macho Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy.) It is the sheriff's duty to protect the community from people wondering around in his/her field jacket.<br /><br />Well push comes to shove when the sheriff verdantly or invariantly draws "First Blood".  Now nether one can back down and the whole town and surrounding hills becomes a shooting gallery.<br /><br />There is only one man who may be able to save the situation if anyone is willing to listen, but will they? Yep its is Rambo's old commander Col. Samuel Trautman well played by Richard Crenna.</p></body></html>

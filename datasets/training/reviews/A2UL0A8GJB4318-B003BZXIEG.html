<meta name="summary" content=""Last Stand" flickers out the Franchise"></head><body><p>To say that seing "X-Men: The Last Stand" was never-racking for a giant fan of the first two chapters in the mutant saga was putting it lightly.  The departure of cerebral director Bryan Singer for the sledgehammer simplicity of Brett Ratner did not bode well for the franchises' future.  Thrown in the fact that the writers of "X2" left with Singer and Zak Penn (Inspector Gadget) and Simon Kinberg (Mr. and Mrs. Smith) replaced them, and the thematic weight, intelligence and character development that made the first two "X-Men" movies so satisfying looked as if it was going to be severely handicapped.  Sadly, that is just what happened.<br /><br />"The Last Stand" did start off with promising premise:  A pharmaceutical company run by a mutant-phobe (Michael Murphy) creates a way to suppress the mutant genes in all the world's mutants.  Marketed as a benevolent cure, the X-Men (Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier, Halle Berry as Storm and newcomer Kelsey Grammar doing unexpectedly great work as the warmly intellectual Beast) and all their fellow mutants have to grapple with the ethical implications and consequences that the cure presents.  What would a person, mutant or otherwise, do if they had the power to remove genetic differences they had with an accepted norm and avoid the possible persecution that comes with beng an outsider?  However, the nefarious Magneto (an ever-superb Ian McKellen) sees the cure as a way to subdue and eradicate the mutant population.  The X-Men, caught in the middle between the humans and Magneto's growing army of disaffected and threatened Mutants, have to step up and fight in a desparate end-game.<br /><br />But the promise and potential of the premise is wasted.  The question of the cure is raised, but it is never plumbed for thematic richness, and in the end, it is simply used as a weapon to deliver visceral, shallow thrills.  Ratner, Penn, and Kinberg do their plot no favors by throwing in the saga of Jean Grey as the ressurected Phoenix (Famke Jansen), and way too many new characters.  None of the story's nourishing sub-plots or supporting characters are germinated or allowed to mature, and the emotional impact of the movie is blunted by the overdose of too much mutant mayhem, plot and chaos.  Even the deaths of three major characters inspire only indifference.  The action may be incredibly and visually impressive (no sequence moreso than Magneto's rerouting of the Golden Gate Bridge) but Ratner, Penn and Kinberg do not understand that action holds weight only when the audience can give a damn about the figures involved.  Ratner and co. squandered much of the goodwill leftover from Bryan Singer, and even though a ton of money will be made off of the "Last Stand," audiences will hesitate a long time before even considering seeing an "X4."</p></body></html>

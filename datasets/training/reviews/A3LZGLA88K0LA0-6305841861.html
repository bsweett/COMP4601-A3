Due to copyright restrictions or some other legalese, Sam Raimi wasn't allowed to use footage of the original Evil Dead, so it's almost like Ash is starting all over with his deadly confrontation in the woods.  This time it's only Ash and his girlfriend who stumble upon a deserted cabin and also upon the Book of the Dead.  Four other characters enter the picture, but it's really a tour de force for Bruce Campbell as Ash in this bloody, outrageously comic take off of horror films.  Utilizing excellent hand held camera work and some gross out effects, EVIL DEAD 2 is a non-stop onslaught of gore and comedy.  Watching Campbell battle his own possessed hand is outrageously brilliant, and Raimi's nod to other great directors like Alfred Hitchcock is marvelous.  Note the visuals when the characters eyes move in different directions at the same time, a device Hitch used in the explosive restaurant scene in THE BIRDS.  This is a marvelous cinematic homage to Hitch.  Don't focus on plot holes or cheesy effects where you can see the set crew in the background.  Bask in Campbell's over the top performance and just enjoy one of the most frenetically charged horror comedies of our time.</p></body></html>

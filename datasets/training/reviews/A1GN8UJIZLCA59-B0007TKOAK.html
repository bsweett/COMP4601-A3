<meta name="summary" content="A Trip To Wine Country"></head><body><p>Alexander Payne's Sideways is a very funny, but deep movie about two friends, Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church), who travel up to wine country for a weeklong bachelor party for Jack.  Miles is a depressed divorcee who is an English teacher, but is trying to get a novel published while Jack is a womanizing former soap opera star that is making a living doing voiceovers.  Miles is also a major oenophile and wine plays a huge part in the film.  Miles & Jack go out to dinner at a restaurant Miles frequents while he's in the area and they meet a waitress, Mya (Virginia Madsen), that Jack tries to hook Miles up with.  Jack falls for a server at a vineyard, Stephanie (Sandra Oh), who ends up being friends with Mya and the four have dinner and end up spending time together.  Through it all Miles can't break out of his depression and Jack ends up paying a price for his sexual dalliances.  All four lead actors are excellent, but Mr. Giamatti is the heart and soul of the film.  He gives a brilliant performance and his lack of an Academy Award nomination will go down as one of the biggest snubs in history.  The one problem with the film is that the last half-hour is quite slow and doesn't live up to rest of the picture.  Other than that, Sideways is an excellent film. Mr. Payne's Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar is well deserved as the dialogue is funny, thought-provoking and never dull.</p></body></html>

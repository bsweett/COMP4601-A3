<meta name="summary" content="Colin Farrell acts all emotions in the Phone Booth."></head><body><p>Released by 20th Century Fox and presented by Fox 2000 Pictures, &quot;Phone Booth&quot;.  Colin Farrell stars as a man in New York City on 53rd Street.  He uses this payphone booth everyday to call his girlfriend.  This phone booth is the last glass-enclosed with a door (like the one's used in the 1970's) that exists and the only one working in the area.  So Colin uses the phone booth to place a call like he always does.  Then the phone rings for him.  It is a sniper.  If he leaves the booth he would be killed.  The sniper (voice of Kiefer Sutherland) can even make a three-way call and try to destroy the relationship Colin has with his girlfriend.  The laser-rifle is pointed at Colin.  One wrong move, one wrong phone call.../ Yet another film that is off-tint.  I dislike this color process of film where the color is altered.  Color-bleaching, I dislike this too.  The outside scenes with Colin are all off-tint or color faded.  When he makes a phone call, we see a little &quot;window&quot; of who he is talking to in full color.  Plays better on television.  Actually mostly filmed on 5th Street in Los Angeles.  Filmed in 10 days.  DVD offer audio commentary by Joel Schumacher.</p></body></html>

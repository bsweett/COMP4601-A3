<meta name="summary" content="Oedipus, Lear, and more."></head><body><p>Ethan Edwards is one of the screen's most memorable and complex characterizations.  His racism, impassioned rage, cold brutality, rugged individualism, and indestructible tenacity coexist with qualities of tenderness and affection, penetrating insight and principled high-mindedness.  Yet much of him remains inscrutable, testimony to the mysteries of human identity itself.  In many respects, Marty (Jeff Hunter) is the nominal &quot;hero,&quot; someone who strikes a balance between the individual and social world, frontier and domestic realm, and who sees beyond skin color and blood to the spiritual bond that  unites all human beings.  But there's no way John Wayne's tortured character--driven by lost opportunities in the past and vengeful priorities in the present--can be challenged.  He shoots out the eyes of dead Indians to insure their spirits will never be admitted to the happy hunting grounds, but like Oedipus and Lear it is his own blindness that denies him peace.  His epiphany is all the more powerful due to its unexpectedness.<p>Even were the rest of the film prosaic, &quot;The Searchers&quot; would rank among the best of American cinema.  But John Ford's storytelling magic is also on display at its best, creating an epic narrative that conveys the magnitude of space and the passing of time with equal verisimilitude.  Curiously, &quot;Shane&quot; commands a considerably higher price than &quot;The Searchers.&quot;  I'd argue that &quot;Shane,&quot; a much heralded film at the time of its release, has lost stature and cinematic interest, whereas exactly the opposite is true of &quot;The Searchers.&quot;  As for print quality, the restored DVD version is far from perfect but at least 50% better than earlier VHS editions.  That's good enough in the case of this masterpiece.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Uh guys, maybe it's time to meet some new people" 3.5 stars"></head><body><p>I watched this late at night after a long day and have to say its stark-but-muted drama, with attractive actors beautifully photographed in cool clothes while reciting arch dialogue was a good match for my mood. I didn't have to like any of the characters, I didn't have to be envious of anybody, I just had to kick back and watch them screw each other over.<br /><br />Although I had originally kind of snorted at Portman's Oscar nomination I see now that it makes sense. She's not a revelation but she's much better than I expected and she's the human ingredient the movie needs. Clive Owen, too, is great. He looks like he could snap walnuts between his toes.<br /><br />A perfect double-feature with last year's equally depressing, equally attractive, equally hard-to-stop-watching "We Don't Live Here Anymore." Watch both with somebody you're trying to break up with an they'll be gone before the sun circles around in the sky.<br /><br />As much as I liked the movie, I have to say that with all of the characters swapping partners they're a bunch that desperately need an aggressive shower (preferably cold) and possibly a couple of screenings for STD's. "Meet some other people," I wanted to say to them. "You're Jude/Julia/Natalie/Clive. You don't have to make each other so miserable; there's a whole world of other possibilities out there."</p></body></html>

Unfortunately, it was hampered by two sets  of negative criticism: one which held the film should have been entirely  about the African-American soldiers of the 54th Massachusetts, and not at  all about their white officers; and one which said Matthew Broderick lacked  the authority to be a believable military commander. Both schools of  thought are ridiculous beyond words. What Glory celebrates is our common  humanity, particularly the bond between soldiers fighting together for the  sake of freedom; this is, in fact, the entire point of the film, and it  would be impossible to depict if either whites or blacks were  supernumeraries. As for Matthew Broderick's performance, for me his  boyishness adds to its power. His character is a pampered young man from a  privileged background who must, in a time of national emergency, become a  leader of men, and Broderick is the perfect actor to play such a character.  For me, this film goes almost beyond praise.  The performances--not only  Broderick's but also Denzel Washington's, Morgan Freeman's and Andre  Braugher's--rank among the greatest of that decade; the battle scenes are  played for maximum suspense and emotional impact; the cinematography of  Freddie Francis is blazingly brilliant. I know there are people who haven't  been moved by this film, but for the life of me, I can't understand why.</p></body></html>

The first being Bowling for Columbine, a film I loved so much, that I still use examples from that movie when the topic of guns comes up. But lets talk about Open Range. I never saw Kevin Costner in a film, and I heard bad things about him. But I wanted to see Open Range, so I went. As beautiful as the field was in the beginning, I was starting to think that mabye I made a mistake. Then five minutes passed. I was into that movie straight off, and Robert Duvall's character of Boss Spearman was filled with heart and humor, the perfect mixture of a character. <p>The film stars Duvall and Kevin Costner, who also directed, as Boss Spearman and Charley Waite. They've been fellow cattlemen for about a decade now. With the help of Mose Harrison and Button, they move there cattle. With no land of their own they let the cattle graze in open field. But a man named Denton Baxter, an Irishmen who owns a small town a few miles from the field, doesn't want freegrazer's in his field. <p>After Mose heads down to that town and doesn't return, Charley and Boss go to the town and find out that he was involved in a fight, and was beaten and put in jail by Baxter, and Sheriff Poole. They bring him to the town doctor, Doc, and his sister Sue Barlow. Boss and Charley bring him back to the cattle, but they are not going to give up with fighting Baxter and his crew. <p>Boss and Charley go theatren a few of Baxter's thugs, who have been watching the group. When they return to the wagon they find Mose and the dog dead, and Button wounded. Returning to town, they leave Button with Sue and they get ready for the final showdown to get revenge on those who have hurt them.<p>A strong and powerful film, acted by Kevin Costner, the wonderful Robert Duvall, and the great Annette Benning, Open Range didn't just make me smile at the end, but it had me involved right from the very beginning. With amazing settings, and characters you grow to love, Open Range is on my list as one of the best movies of 2003. For two hours and a half of drama and suspense, Open Range is the best solution.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for violence.</p></body></html>

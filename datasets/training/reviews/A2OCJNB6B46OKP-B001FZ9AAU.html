With the major advances in special effects and CGI it was time to finally bring the true comic book character off the page and to the big screen accuratly. Since then we have seen the amazing,(Spider-Man) the dreadful(Hulk), the Unknown (Sin City), and the renewed. (Batman Begins)<br /><br />Now a brand new experiment is about to take flight with a whole chain of movies linked together to culminate in what could be one of the highest grossing and most amazing films ever to hit the big screen. It all begins with the legendary Marvel character Iron Man. This is the story of rich and powerful Tony Stark suddenly finding out he is extremly vulnerable due to a complication with his heart. With this occurance Stark has an ephany and realizes there is more to life than power and he decides to use his power and inginuity to become a super hero. Now he has created a powerful exo-skeletal suit to keep him alive, but at the same time save the world and protect all that is good. All that with just a little time to show off is not too shabby.<br /><br />This movie is probably one of the best in the comic book film genre. It has all the elements that make a film enjoyable. An excellent origin story by director John Farravau. A steller performance from Robert Downey Jr. and his supporting cast. It's fast, dramatic, humerous and flat out fun. Still, this is only the begining of a much bigger picture in the Marvel film universe. But, you won't know that until the very end.</p></body></html>

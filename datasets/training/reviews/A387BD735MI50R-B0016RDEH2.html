<meta name="summary" content="A Visual Poem"></head><body><p>While this film is spoken in Spanish (with English subtitles available), the Director gives his commentary in perfect English. And his commentary is very worthwhile, so be sure to get a DVD that includes it as bonus material.<br /><br />Guillermo Del Toro's remarks add to the understanding and enjoyment of the film. It's like attending a lively filmmaker's master class. Even if you aren't interested in the art of projecting story and emotion on a screen, you'll still undoubtedly find the talk-over interesting.<br /><br />I had missed so many cinematic nuances the first time through. Del Toro says he conceived the movie as a sort of poem, full of visual rhymes, reflections, and symbols. As he points out his interplay of imagery, the viewer sees deeper into the method and meaning of every scene. While the movie itself involves a fantastical labyrinth, the Director's commentary is a lucid look to the bottom of an enchanted pool.</p></body></html>

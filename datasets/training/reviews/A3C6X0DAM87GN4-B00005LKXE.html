But, I can't help it, it's what I honestly feel. &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; was indeed a good movie. One though, I must admit, I felt was given a little too much credit then it deserved. For instance, if I were to write a review for it, I would probably give the movie 3 stars. But, the trouble I had with &quot;Lambs&quot; was that it didn't completely carry me. I wasn't totally involved. &quot;Hannibal&quot; on the other hand I find to be a very gripping, intense, and entertaining movie. The only reason one might dislike this film is because it's a sequel. I too personally dislike many sequels, expect for the ones we all love, &quot;The Godfather part 2&quot;, &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot;....ect. But there's something about this film that just had that certain something where I couldn't take my eyes off it. Ridley Scott, who is just coming off his &quot;Gladiator&quot; success, has made yet another wonderful film. I think everyone knows what this movie is about. Either they saw it already in theathers, or where told by friends. So, I won't go into detail about this film. I will only mention the strong points of the film. Lets start out with the acting. Anthony Hopkins is wonderful once again as Hannibal Lecter. There is a change in the character now. That change is for the better I feel. Lecter seems, and excuse me for the use of this word, more cool. He has more of a suave input on things now. And I personally like him this way. As for Julianne Moore, well. she's just great! We don't miss Foster at all in this movie. Moore delivers an excellent performance. I only wish her and Hopkins had more scenes together. But the ones they do have, hit the jackpot. They both seemed to play off each other very well in this movie. I was really surpised to see Giancarlo Giannini (Whom I personally rememeber seeing in Visconti's &quot;The Innocent&quot;). He doesn't really have what I would dare call a strong character in the film. I mean, no one I know is going to see this movie for him. The one person who is amazing in this movie goes unbilled. He plays Mason Verger (I'm still debating if I should reveal in or not, oh, why not, everyone's seen the movie already) Gary Oldman is a real highpoint in this film. I couldn't even recongize him in this film. The next thing to talk about is the screenplay. I love David Mamet's writting style. I hope there are others out there who enjoy his work as much as I do. Ridley Scott, in my opinion does a wonderful job setting up things. He's a director whom I'm really taken notice to lately. Well, there you have it. Those are my reason to go see this movie. And, I know it's kinda early on in the year to say this, but, this movie could be one of the best films of the year!</p></body></html>

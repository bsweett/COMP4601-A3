But it turned out to be compelling, thought-provoking, and just plain entertaining.<br /><br />You know the plot. The critics called this "a nasty piece of work" and so on. Well, there is nastiness. But it's not just the violence (most of which is off-screen and implied). It's the nastiness of the justice system. This is the movie version of "The Death of Common Sense" - the criminal-friendly, evidence-killing justice system that allows murderers and rapists to go free based on technicalities, forcing prosecutors to make deals to gain silly "wins" is the "broken" aspect on display here. Any sane person can readily see the two warring sides of this coin, as shown in the movie - the injustice of the system and the workarounds necessary. By the end of the movie, no-one's worried about Clyde's civil rights anymore - the lesson he intends to teach. (And how he does it is a doozie.)<br /><br />Despite the fact that his agenda spills over into semi-innocent blood, I found myself rooting for Clyde the whole way through. This is what made the critics queasy - they found themselves rooting for him too, despite their criminal-friendly, respect-their-rights-above-all-else sensibilities. (Well, unless they're the victims, in which case we often find they're hiding guns in every corner of their own houses. See Carl Rowan, et al.) Because the "innocent" victims also knew that they had, in some measure, brought this on themselves. Is it unfair? Perhaps; but then again, they were just working within the crazy "progressive" justice system. The question the movie asks is, when do they start respecting the rights of the victims more? (I don't mean the race-driven travesties of the Tawana Brawley or the lacrosse cases.)<br /><br />The anti-Bush, anti-Catholic-church guy who flew his plane into an IRS building (oops, didn't your newspaper give you that information?) is another disturbing example. Although we are repulsed by his final act, reading his screed we can certainly be digusted with a system (in this case the IRS and Mr. Moynihan) that can arbitrarily continually crush a hard-working engineer just trying to get the same breaks that Timothy Geithner and his peers do.<br /><br />These are disturbing questions that should not arise in the minds of "regular" folk like us. It provokes thought and even critique. Thought is not allowed in certain circles, only assent. This movie cracks open the door a little too much for comfort.<br /><br />It was fun, and it was too short.</p></body></html>

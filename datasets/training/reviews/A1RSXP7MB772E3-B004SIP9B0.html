A toss of fiction and fact that doesn't get too dirty with sleazy dramatics."></head><body><p>Although short, and demeaningly unpartisan, you get a transformational performance, not just by Helen Mirren, but by Micheal Sheen who plays PM Tony Blair. I've sat in and watched the PM many times on CSpan, particularly during his defensive speeches in the tumultuous court where the house of commons is held and Sheens likeness is staggering for me and also brings a real, profound feel to the film which is pursued to an even higher level with the smart screen play. Toss any mention of awards out the window, truely see this film for a rare opportunity to see a powerful and meaningful lead female performance. I mean performance in every new sense of the word. It almost reminds me of the possessive performance last year by Philip Seymour Hoffman as Capote. I can only imagine the homework needed for such insightful and catapulting performances. This isn't a directors film, its a film carried by its actors, much like this years Dreamgirls but yet it blends so seemlessly together that without some sort of nod in Stephen Frears, I would feel consciously guilty. It takes the 'right' man for the job to capture all the goodness of this film and not flounder it! At least I must imagine. Sort of like too much talent on one basketball team, and you end up with only a conference championship because of the impossible complexities and overwhelming duty towards placing all of them coherently together. Since the awards have an almost stale approach to gifting the years best movie award to factional movies dealing with unpopular times, I would make this film the sleeper hit. But all bets are with the Departed. It's Martins year.</p></body></html>

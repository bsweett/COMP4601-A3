His friend is killed but Wahlberg makes it out. Disillusioned, he leaves the service to live a hermetic lifestyle in the mountains. A few years later, Danny Glover comes calling asking him to serve his country one more time. They know an attempt will be made on the President's life but not where. They ask Wahlberg to scout the cities the president will be in making speeches, and determine which one would be the logical place the killer would do it. After he gives them the location, an attempt is made but Wahlberg is blamed. The rest of the film is him on the run and trying to unravel what happened. It leads him to a conspiracy involving a high ranking member of congress.<br /><br />A lot of unbelievable things happen in Shooter but they're done in a stylish way. The plot is an intriguing one even if you do see a few events coming from a mile away. The action is sharp and fast paced with a lot of good performances. Shooter is a step below the Bourne films as government conspiracy action movies go, but it's an enjoyable couple of hours.</p></body></html>

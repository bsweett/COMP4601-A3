<meta name="summary" content="the book is probably much better"></head><body><p>Farm boy Eragon (Edward Speelers) comes upon a dragon's egg, sent by Princess Arya. One day, the dragon, Saphira, is born, and Eragon becomes the dragon rider who will set his people free from a tyrant, Galbatorix (John Malkovich).<br /><br />I found the actors bland, weak, lacking in interpretation. I don't care for Malkovich usually, but even in this film, his acting wasn't what it could have been. Jeremy Irons' character on the other hand was quite despicable! and his acting was right on for the part.<br /><br />The storyline was also pretty basic, and because the opening credits mentioned this was an adaptation of a book, I realized many situations might be missing from the screen.<br /><br />Also, I didn't find the dragon Saphira, feminine enough. However, the special effects in general were well done, certainly not extraordinary but well done.<br /><br />I'm giving it a 5, and I'm probably being generous, considering I haven't read the book. If I had, I probably would have given it a 3 or 4.<br /><br />Not a bad choice for an action/sci-fi film, if you have nothing else to watch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Who's your Huckleberry?"></head><body><p>This is a fun movie.  Kurt Russell is dead-on as a wiley Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer steals every scene he appears in as Doc Holliday.  Bill Paxton is good as Wyatt's brother Morgan. Is there anyone that looks better under a cowboy hat than Sam Elliot?  He plays brother Virgil Earp.  Not so much a true narrative as a series of vignettes featuring the above characters (with the centerpiece Shootout at the OK Corral) the film is nonetheless a very entertaining look at these characters.  Powers Boothe is menacingly bad as Curly Bill, the leader of the outlaw Cowboys. <p>Kilmer's Doc Holliday, in particular, is a load of fun. &quot;I'm your Huckleberry&quot; he taunts Johnny Ringo, and although I have no idea where this saying originated, Kilmer repeats it in this film to entertaining effect.  Later on he is asked why he sticks his neck out for Sheriff Earp.  &quot;Wyatt Earp is my friend&quot;, he replies simply.  The other man scoffs &quot;I've got LOTS of friends&quot;.  &quot;I don't&quot; says Doc.<p>This is the kind of movie that perpetuates the &quot;Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot;, but it's also the kind of movie that grown men still quote liberally with big smiles on their faces more than a decade after it's initial release.</p></body></html>

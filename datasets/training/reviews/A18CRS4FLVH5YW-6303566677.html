[Rumor has it that] MGM (they just released a special editon of this movie in the UK) ...says they are set to re-release a special editon version in America tentatively for this August (not sure of the day yet).  The version being released in the states will actually have MORE than the UK version, plus a possibility is planned to release a limited edition 3 disc set of only 30,000 copies in North America!  WOO HOO!  Save your money folks, don't buy, it's not worth it and with a movie like The Terminator, you know that isn't going to be on OOP lists for long.  Cheers!</p></body></html>

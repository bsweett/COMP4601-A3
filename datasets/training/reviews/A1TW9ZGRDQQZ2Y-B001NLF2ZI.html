<meta name="summary" content="The Acting Bumped this One From a 3 to a 4 Star Rating"></head><body><p>This is a pretty good thriller that can be a little long winded at times, but still managed to keep my interest throughout the two hour running time. The acting by Nicole Kidman is some of the best she has done in quite some time (a great comeback after the horrible "Stepford Wives" remake) and Sean Penn takes a more laid back approach to his character here and it works to his benefit. It's hard to describe this movie without giving anything away (it has a pretty standard political assassination plot), but if you are the mood for a political thriller which focuses on the character drama just as much as the thriller aspect, you might enjoy this one. I don't regret seeing it in theater, but I kind of wish I waited to see this one on DVD.</p></body></html>

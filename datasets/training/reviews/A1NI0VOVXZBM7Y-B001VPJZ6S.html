<meta name="summary" content="The Breakfast Club."></head><body><p>Saw it on Netflix,although a bit long and overdramatic at times, it is the quintessential 80's movie and a must see. It still relates to High School and modern school cliques and how everyone goes with their own whether it be class,color or social.Just to see Molly she is beautiful, I love redheads,But I am A bigger Fan of Brunettes and found the quiet girl turned beautiful cliche even better than molly. Yes the movie is long,the dance sequence is looked aside by me but it's a good movie.</p></body></html>

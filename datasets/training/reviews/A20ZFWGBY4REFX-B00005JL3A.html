<meta name="summary" content="Milla Jovovich has never been better in "Resident Evil"!!"></head><body><p>To me, "Resident Evil" is a film that delivers intense action as well as cutting-edge special effects from thrilling start to breathtaking finish! I have played all the "Resident Evil" games on PlayStation and I thought that the film version definitely lived up to the games in a big way! "Resident Evil" takes place in a future city called Raccoon City. A lethal virus has been released inside a medical facility building called the Umbrella Corporation, killing everyone in sight and shutting down elevators, etc. The main character is a woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich, "The Fifth Element"), who is teamed up with a group of commandos (including Michelle Rodriguez, "The Fast and The Furious") to find the cause of everything that went on inside the complex...but not before some flesh-eating, virus-infected zombies come chasing after them! And the movie goes on from there. A lot of the credit goes to Screen Gems, part of Sony Pictures Entertainment, for bringing this movie to the big screen. Also to Milla Jovovich for not just her performance, but for her physical abilities as well. I mean, you should have seen Milla fight off those virus-infected canines one-by-one! In fact, Milla kind of reminds you of Angelina Jolie in last year's "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider". And also to Michelle Rodriguez for her outstanding role as Rain, who is part of the commando team and to director Paul Anderson ("Mortal Kombat", "Event Horizon"), he did an outstanding job in directing his second video game adaption since "Mortal Kombat"! With a great soundtrack, excellent supporting cast, and lots of action to boot, "Resident Evil" is the best thrill ride of 2002 by far! I can not wait for the DVD to be released!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Real bears aren't cuddly"></head><body><p>It's a cliche of course but watching Grizzly Man is like watching a car crash in slow motion. You should turn away but on some low, shameful level it's fascinating so you don't.  Timothy Treadwell treated grizzly bears, one of the most dangerous animals in America, like they were Disney teddies come to life and was roundly despised by many professional naturalists. It is amazing that he survived as long as he did before getting eaten.<br /><br />That said, the documentary is really superb. It shows you who Treadwell was and it shows you in a crystal clear way why his death was inevitable. There are two scenes in the film that are unforgetable. The first is Treadwell having a cursing tantrum in front of the camera (anybody walking in on him at that moment would've slowly backed away and run for their car) and the second is when the doctor who autopsied what was left of Treadwell is interviewed.<br /><br />Grizzly Man is a gut wrencher and and outstanding piece of work. It pulls off a nearly impossible trick. It tells the story of an unlikable person and manages to make you care and feel sorrow for his fate.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="We never feel sorry for Hitler; but we do see him as a flawed human being"></head><body><p>Based on a memoir by Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries, this 2004 German film tells the story of Hitler's last days.  It takes place almost entirely in the bunker beneath the streets of Berlin and the viewer gets to watch the deterioration of the man who embodied the epitome of evil of our time.  This is a time of his weakness, his madness, and his unwillingness to understand the real defeat of his monstrous empire.  This film does not depict the Third Reich in all its glory.  Rather, we see its pitiful demise.<br /><br />The cast feels absolutely authentic, and the most moving part of all is when Joseph Goebbles and his wife murder their own six children before committing suicide themselves because, as they say it, they cannot picture a life for their family after National Socialism.  The casting is excellent.  Hitler is very believable as the aging dictator who lapses into madness but who still commands absolute loyalty from all the people around him.  Alexandra Maria Lara is cast as the young secretary.  She's very pretty and has extremely large and expressive eyes.  She's young and na?ve and worships her leader.  However, at the end of the film, the real Traudal Junge, an old lady in 2002 when she wrote her memoir, is shown before the camera talking about her innocence and naivety in her youth and expresses deep regret for following Hitler so blindly.<br /><br />The film was over two hours long and the setting is quite claustrophobic.  It's also unsettling to view Hitler so up close and personal.  We never feel sorry for him.  But we do see him as a very flawed human being.  And, of course we know how it will all end.  However, I did find the film intriguing.  It's another glimpse into the unthinkable world that Nazi Germany was.  This is not a film for everyone.  But it does add some insight from a unique perspective to the whole sorry story.</p></body></html>

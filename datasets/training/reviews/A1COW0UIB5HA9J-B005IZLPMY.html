<meta name="summary" content="A great prequel to the Avengers saga"></head><body><p>In 1942 as America enters WWII, a skinny and timid man named Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) with his best friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan) sign up for training yet Rogers is determined to be a great soldier despite being weakly. So in turn, Dr. Erkstine (Stanley Tucci) with industry captain Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) conducts an experiment on him that turns Rogers into an enhanced and more tougher version of himself including enhanced fighting skills and improved Stamina as he wields a shield made out of a rare metal as he becomes Captain America who is the first Avenger ever. Nazi leader Jonahn Schmidt aka Red-Skull (Hugo Weaving) is the head of a Nazi organization called HYDRA where he wants absolute power from an ancient magic cube that thinks might make him more powerful than ever as Captain America wages war on Hydra.<br /><br />Co-starring Samuel L Jackson, Tommy Lee Jones and Haley Atwell, this movie is a prequel to the Avengers saga and Rocketeer director Joe Johnson has done a great job of making this well acted and well produced comic based saga to life. An improvement over the 1990 monstrosity, Evans was fantastic and Hugo was born to play RedSkull. The film is an action packed extravaganza that is quite true to the original Marvel comics of the 40s and 60s, i like how they used amazing digital make-up in the Benjamin Button tradition on Evan's character to make him a weakling which looked almost real and how Hugo's make-up was. This movie is basically a prequel to The Avengers films which started with Iron Man in 2008 as if you can link this with Iron Man afterwards then Incredible Hulk then Iron man 2 and finally Thor to know the whole story then you get "Avengers". The film has that Indiana Jones feel of adventure in a timeless period and that's what is so cool about this movie plus there are 2 endings like one after the credits then finally a teaser to Avengers.<br /><br />This DVD/Blu-Ray combo contains quality picture and theater style sound with cool extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, trailers, featurettes and a funny short film that takes place during "Thor".</p></body></html>

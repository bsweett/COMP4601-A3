I'm sure when this was pitched the honchos probably jumped across the desk and had the contracts in hand.  Roger Corman in his heyday probably could have taken this and do it on a shoestring budget without any stars and make a ton of money.  Nonetheless this flick has John Cusack on hand who would be accused of slumming if he wasn't one of the producers.  The $64,000.00<br /> question is does the film work.  For the most part, yeah.  "Hot Tub Machine" is unashamedly raunchy version of "Back to the Future" with a twist of "Porky's" thrown in.  This is terrific flick for the bros to sit around to and drink beer.  I might add, though, that my sister liked it and my wife gave it a marginal pass.</p></body></html>

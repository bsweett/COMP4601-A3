Isn't a sky captain like a steward?"></head><body><p>Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow: 8 out of 10: It was King Kong that made me fall in love with the movie. He doesn't appear himself (unlike ring mate Godzilla who cameos in silhouette in a Japanese newspaper.) but his ship and his friends are there and his tree is there. You know the moss covered tree that covers the impossibly deep chasm. To one he uses to fling helpless sailors to there death like some kind of lumberjack games blood sport. There the tree is in glorious faded color just as I left it in the imagination of my seven-year old self.<br /><br />I was enjoying myself up to that point mind you I had for one thing decided that this was an Anime rather than a regular film. (The giant robots make this illusion much more palatable as did an annoying performance by Miss Paltrow. In anime, the female characters are usually whining up a storm.) This allowed all the plot holes, substandard acting (along with Gwyneth Paltrow's overbearing performance we have the thespian talents of Jude Law) and scientific flubs to fall by the wayside. I just sat back and enjoyed the ride.<br /><br />A tour de force showing from Angelina Jolie as an eye-patch wearing British Commander also refreshes the movie halfway through. One wishes the film were about her and not the tepid whining leads.<br /><br />Much has been made of the use of CGI but let us face it. It is simply easier to put CGI effects on an artificial background rather than place them in photo-realistic settings as the snakes of Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid or the wolves in Day after Tomorrow have proved most recently.<br /><br />Sure Sky Captain is far from perfect. An actual villain would have helped and been more in line with the serials it was emulating. The dialogue sounds like George Lucas wrote it. In addition director Kerry Conran is more an art director than a story teller, but try telling that to the seven year old in me that kept saying, "Cool what's next".</p></body></html>

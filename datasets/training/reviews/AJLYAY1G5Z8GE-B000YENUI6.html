<meta name="summary" content="Quite Dark and a bit Vague!"></head><body><p>Anna, a nurse at a hospital, gives birth to a russian baby whose mother had died delivering it. The mother had a diary with her that explains all her horrible experiences with a mob in London. Anna hoping to trace back the address of the mother's family so they would take care of the baby, gives the diary to a russian restauarant owner for translation hoping he could help finally help her get the address. Later on she realizes he is the mob head and she risks her life, her family's and the baby's lives too onward.<br /><br />I did not like the movie much. I just learned today from an online review that Nikolai, the mob's driver, was actually an undercover agent. It was not clear at all in the film.</p></body></html>

It truly lived up to the hype that had surrounded it for the months that I failed to see it in the theaters.  Flawlessly directed by Clint Eastwood, _Mystic River_ has all of its bases covered-great filmmaking, directing, script, actors, etc.  In the end, however, this movie comes down to the quality of the acting.  Everyone is in this film.  And I mean everyone.  While Sean Penn steals the show in my book, his character has to compete with Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, and Laura Linney.  Everyone does a superb job and together they create a film that will quickly become a classic.<br /><br />Many have knocked the film for its "unsatisfying" ending.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  One has to wonder what these audience members expected-a happy, Hollywood ending where everyone joins hands and dances around the Maypole?  Had _Mystic River_ fallen to these stale devices, the film would have blown up and taken hits for wasting all of its potential.<br /><br />In my opinion, faulting this film for not having a "satisfying" ending is just to fundamentally disagree about what "satisfying" entails.  If you want a "popcorn" flick that satisfies your desire to turn off your heart for ninety minutes, do not rent this film-it will not "satisfy" you.  But if you want an original film with a compelling storyline and complex morality, this film definitely "satisfies."  The emotions in this film are real.  The actors are real.  The performances are real.  Robbins haunting performance at the end of the film is real.  Are there loose ends?  Yeah.  Does the film leave you wondering?  Sure.  Is it a happy ending?  No way.  But all of these facts point to the very reason that the film succeeds.</p></body></html>

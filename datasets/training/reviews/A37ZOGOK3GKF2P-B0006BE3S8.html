<meta name="summary" content="'Alien' is Cool, 'Predator' a Puss"></head><body><p>Forget "Spiderman 2," this was the film I was looking so foward too.  That was until I saw the TV spots and I heard those dreaded words, RATED PG13.  My heart sank.  How can a movie based on 2 hardcore R rated film series compromise itself with a lesser rating?<br /><br />The storyline was clever.  The special effects were great.  The alien was relentless in his pursuits.  My problem lied with the Predator.  (...)  We want gore, blood, guts. Instead we get a friendly predator who makes nice-nice with a woman and they tag team the queen.  Still, I enjoy seeing any monster movie.  At least after many years of rumors, it was made.  My main objection is that it could have been so much more.  Maybe the sequel will go for it and not worry about attracting the teenie bop market.  Oh, yes!  Look out for the lamest ending.  I mean, please.  So much material in these legacys and that is the best they can do?</p></body></html>

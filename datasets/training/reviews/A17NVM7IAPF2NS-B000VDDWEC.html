<meta name="summary" content="A "human" horror film..."></head><body><p>American marketing unfortunately touts this as a horror film...which it is!  But it is so much more.<p>This is not your run-of-the-mill Freddy Kreuger or Jason Vorhees slasher.  It's a story with heart and emotion, to use an overused cliche.<p>A deadly virus named "Rage" is accidentally released as animal rights activists become infected as a result of their efforts to release monkeys undergoing extremely cruel experimentation.  I seem to recall several in the audience laughing when the scientist who tries to stop them explains that they are infected with "rage", and I'm saddened to think those who laughed completely missed one of major themes of the movie which I will delve into later.<p>Fast forward 28 days to Jim who wakes up from a coma in the middle of a deserted hospital.  He slowly comes to realize that the entire city of London appears to be deserted.  ...  One of the elements that the movie brings out is that our world would be better off if we could eradicate "rage" from our society.  It also brings up the theme that "rage" cannot be caged as is metaphorically brought up in the opening scene.<p>What is so endearing about this movie at times is the camarderie and happy times occasionally shared by the survivors in their desparate attempt to survive.  The love that they eventually share for each other is especially heartbreaking when one or another falls prey to the evil that surrounds them.<p>There are so many aspects of this film and I hope I touch on some of the more memorable ones:<p>1.  First and foremost, the shooting of the film on digital film lending a home-movie feel to everything is bold and it works.  The gritty feel to everything brings a considerable edginess to the film.<br />2.  Some of the visual shots, while understated, are exquisite.  As one example, the taxi that our survivors head north in pass by flowers that look like a pastel painting.<br />3.  Other shots are subtle.  One scene has a survivor hiding behind a mirror...and it's almost as if she is holding up a mirror to RAGE.  The "infected" studies the mirror for a considerable time and although some might think he is considering whether or not someone is hiding there, others might infer that it is difficult for one to face oneself and it is only the possible incredulity of such behavior that brought out a brief human response of self-study.<p>....<p>I recall leaving the theater overhearing someone saying, "That movie [was lame]!"  Yes, I can believe someone would say that about a film that shows more intelligence, human emotion, and credibility transcending mere horror.</p></body></html>

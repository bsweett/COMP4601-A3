<meta name="summary" content="Not bad, but not great either"></head><body><p>I sat down to watch this on DVD with my five-year-old granddaughter, not expecting very much because of the general poverty (in my opinion) of most kid's animated films. On the other hand, I'm a librarian and I'm aware of the high regard in which Chris Van Allsburg's book is held by children's librarians. And I confess I was impressed -- mostly -- with how well the film carried out the art and action of the book. It's not a "straight" animation, in that it uses 3D motion-capture techniques to give the characters lifelike movements. Tom Hanks does a surprisingly good job voicing the conductor and Santa and all the other adult males, even if he can't sing worth a damn. And, having grown up around railroaders, I loved the details of the train itself. On the other hand, my granddaughter was very uneasy during the vertiginous runaway-train scenes. I know a lot of animated-film fans hated this movie, but it wasn't bad.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Weak Plot"></head><body><p>My wife and I discussed the plot and how it could be improved. The accusation of too many villains has been suggested by reviewers. However, each villian contributes in substantive ways to the emotional climax. My biggest complaint is the reworking of how Peter's uncle died. It didn't quite fit with the original movie.<br /><br />I'm not sure what's wrong with the plot, but it just seems weak. It has been a while since I've read the comic book; however, this plot seems like a soap opera. Peter and his girlfriend have many troubles. However, they seem more like troubles kids would have in junior high rather than two adults in their twenties. For the soap opera plot devices: amnesia for Goblin is introduced; Goblin is then healed and is evil again; and then forces MJ to break up with Peter.  Also a character who is a top model, the commissioner's daughter, and is in all of Peter's classes is introduced just to make things complicated.<br /><br />Another problem with the plot is venom. A meteorite hits and it just happens to be a few hundred yards from where Peter is. This gives venom an opportunity to slither onto the Peter's scooter. Talk about Deus ex machina.<br /><br />The movie lacks humor also. There are a few very good lines, but on the whole it is not very entertaining.<br /><br />On the positive side, the CGI and other special effects were very good. The Sandman effects were very good. Spidey's swinging was even better than the last film. The acting was ok. I thought Church was very good. Maguire looked a little emaciated, he almost had the Gollum look going on in some scenes. There were musical numbers in this movie and they just did not fit.<br /><br />In summary, the movie is ok. It's long, so keep your expectations low and it may work for you.</p></body></html>

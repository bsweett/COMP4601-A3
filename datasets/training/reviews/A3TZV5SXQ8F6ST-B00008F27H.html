<meta name="summary" content="What Could (Should) Have Been"></head><body><p>Timing is everything.<br /><br />The snarls and delays in getting the screenplay from paper to film made the journey for this picture very difficult; there was this "little" movie made - Star Wars - that revolutionized the Sci-Fi genre and placed a heavy premium on visual effects.<br /><br />So, what appeared to be a trade-off with a major part of the Star Trek TV series - the dialogue of the actors - was jettisoned for visuals that looked impressive, but looked to be playing catch-up to Darth and his pals.<br /><br />The Director's Cut shows what should have been and is a very satisfying mixture of visuals and the personal touch by the cast. This is where the motion picture journey should have began and it was well worth the wait.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Awesome movie"></head><body><p>My review is on the movie itself, rather than the DVD itself. I borrowed from a friend to watch it, and I was NOT disappointed. While I don't collect Iron Man comic books, I do know of the story. While parts had to be changed for the movie, it was not at all disappointing.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie greatly and its characters and story development (and the acting by Robert Downey Jr. was awesome!). Even a die-hard Iron Man fan should not be disappointed in this movie.<br /><br />My favorite part of the movie was when he flew to the Middle East in his new suit, and dealt with the terrorists while saving the civilians, and then leaving the leader of the terrorists to the villagers to do with what they wanted. Sweet justice, indeed!</p></body></html>

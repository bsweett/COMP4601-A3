<meta name="summary" content="A case of mistaken identity or was it?"></head><body><p>Josh Hartnett stars as Slevin Kelevra in Paul McGuigan's farcical crime thriller "Lucky Number Slevin".  Hartnett is immediately immersed in trouble after stepping off a plane in New York, getting mugged.  After crashing his buddy Tony's apartment, in a case of mistaken identity, he is dragged before two rival crime bosses.  The Boss played by Morgan Freeman, head of an Afro-American gang and the Rabbi played by Ben Kingsley head of an Orthodox Jewish mob were previously partners but now lethal enemies.<br /><br />Hartnett, thought of as his friend is apparently indebted to both men and must do their bidding or forfeit his life.  The confusing plot had been spawned by an incident some twenty years ago.  A low level gambler and his family had been murdered owing to a losing $20,000 bet he had made on a fixed horse race.<br /><br />In this bizarre flick, Bruce Willis lurks about playing a hitman working for both Freeman and Kingsley.  Lucy Liu plays Lindsey, Hartnett's love interest and his friend's neighbor.  Stanley Tucci plays omnipresent detective Brikowski who is monitoring the strange happenings.<br /><br />McGuigan thankfully ties the storyline together as this befuddling but entertaining movie climaxes.</p></body></html>

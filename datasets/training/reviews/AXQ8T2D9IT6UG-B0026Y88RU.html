Bear in mind, though, that appearences are not everything...<br /><br />The main character is Slevin (Josh Hartnett), who visits his friend Nick, and falls into the middle of a war between to mob bosses. Those mob bosses, The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley) and The Boss (Morgan Freeman), decide to use Nick to kill each other. The problem is, Nick has disappeared, and The Rabbi and The Boss think that Slevin is Nick. Now Slevin must decide what to do, taking into account that he has only a short amount of time to decide, and that he is being watched not only by the police and the criminals, but also by Goodkat (Bruce Willis), a notorious assassin. What will he do? And will he be able to keep himself and Nick's beautiful neighbour (Lucy Liu) alive?<br /><br />On the whole, I think that you will like this movie, if you are looking for something entertaining that will not make you think you too much, and provided you don't mind the fact that there are many violent scenes. "Lucky Number Slevin" is not perfect, but has an hectic pace, many twists, and the kind of ending that will surprise you. Recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></body></html>

A good example of this is the LOTR trilogy.<br /><br />As mentioned before, the author didn't really keep this series open to that.  Although he mentioned that Blade would be out there, he seemingly had killed Whistler in the previous movie.<br /><br />As mentioned in another review, this isn't what happened.  For this sequel to work, the vampires would have had to infiltrate his lair at the end of the other film.  That makes this sequel feel false.<br /><br />Since others have spoken of the story, which wasn't too bad for a horror film, but it wasn't the most substantial, I would talk about the special effects.  There is a bit more computer-generated effects, which make some of the fighting moves seems a little cartoonish.  Further, in one fight, rather than seeing displays of the martial arts, we see a little bit of WWE professional wrestling.  Rather than give the fight a sense of power, it makes the fight a bit cheesy.<br /><br />Going into the movie, I didn't have the highest of expectations, so it wasn't too bad.  If you are looking for a great film, this is not going to be it.  This is, however, not bad for a Friday night.</p></body></html>

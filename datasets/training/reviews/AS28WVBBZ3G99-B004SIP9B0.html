<meta name="summary" content="Stoic. Regal. Brilliant. Divine."></head><body><p>Commenting on "The Queen" is a bit like daring to touch the Mona Lisa - there is little that might be done to improve it and much that would not.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is brilliant. She conveys a sense of that regal place, owned by  ruling monarchs, of tension between service and leadership - modernity and tradition - privacy and publicity. "The Queen" is a picture of paradox: a woman wholly-sacrificed for her people and a people willingly sacrificed for their sovereign. Mirren captures the paradoxes of the servant (whomever would be the greatest must be the servant of all) so beautifully and stoically.<br /><br />In our world, some arrive at their life's positions by talent, some by hard work, others by luck. But the Queen of England is thrust into her world and her position by divine Providence. And for us mere mortals, Mirren's performance is all that.</p></body></html>

This is simply an astronomical accomplishment.<p>This Platinum Edition 2-disc DVD is what each and every fan of this movie has been dreaming about. Presentation is superb, both in terms of quality as well as bonus content. Sound and image have both been remastered and restored for an excellent viewing experience. And of course, the bonus features...so much of them that it can get overwhelming (not that I'm complaining!). I share the sentiments of some reviewers here who are upset about Disney discontinuing this title, but what's one to do. eBay is still the best place to buy a copy, if you don't mind paying quite a bit for it. I didn't buy myself a copy before it got discontinued but I found a brand new copy at a CVS/Pharmacy store (I kid you not) of all places. Yes, it is true. And what's even more unbelievable, I saw a copy for sale at another CVS store as well. And no, these are not pirated copies. I highly doubt every CVS will have one, but next time you're in there pay attention to their DVD stock. You might find yourself quite happy.</p></body></html>

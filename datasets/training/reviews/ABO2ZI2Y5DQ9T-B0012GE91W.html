<meta name="summary" content="Decent But Should Be Much Longer"></head><body><p>I don't know why, but "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," the fifth installment of Harry Potter films is by far the shortest of the series. Considering the numbers of the characters and the events that happen to them, the film's 138 minutes is too short. It needs three hours and the content deserves that length.<br /><br />Plot thickens here. No more delightful Quidditch can be seen. In spite of the occasional comical moments and Harry's romance, the film's tone gets darker than ever and even Ron's mother looks more worried. If you remember what happened at the end of "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," she should be more worried about her children. That means some scenes might be too scary for kids.<br /><br />New characters (and talent) enter the story - newcomer Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood is most impressive - and some regular characters like Draco Malfoy are almost forgotten. I don't know how many of you miss Draco, but with additional 20 or 30 minutes this kind of thing could be avoided. Helena Bonham Carter's villainous Bellatrix Lestrange is introduced a bit too abruptly in the story, which lessens the impact of the final battle scene and its consequences.<br /><br />The visuals themselves are fantastic as always, but director David Yates is no Alfonso Cuaron. The special effects such as Harry and friends flying over Themes River are, technically, just wizardly, but not imaginative. The scenes are beautiful, but no wicked humor of Shrunken Head. But it all depends on your taste. I just prefer different approach and that's all.<br /><br />The film should be longer by at least 20 minutes, but I believe there is a director's cut somewhere in Warner's studio. Until we see it, sorry, but three stars.</p></body></html>

Sam Spade and partner Miles Archer seem okay, until Ms. O'Shaughnessy (played by Mary Astor) enters the office. Behind her but unseen, a handful of high-living lowlifes, make live disagreeable for Spade & Archer. Until hard-boiled, hard hitting Sam Spade gets the right answers, double-crosses and betrayals high-lite the implied action. Finally, the "stuff that dreams are made out of" emerges in the form of a black falcon--"The Maltese Falcon".<br /><br />The story is from a book by Dashiell Hammett. The film is directed by John Huston, and remains a template for private detective yarns and will for years to come.</p></body></html>

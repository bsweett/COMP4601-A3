<meta name="summary" content="GREAT ACTION, AWESOME VISUALS, OK STORYTELLING!"></head><body><p>"I, Robot" is a good action film with spectacular special effects aided by superb CG visual effects. As for the story itself, it is a fascinating premise that is acted out in an "decent" story. Will Smith does some of his best work to date, and Bridget Moynahan is beautiful and engaging. The rest of the cast does as good a job as they can with the slight let-down of a story.<br /><br />Overall, "I, Robot" is an above-standard action epic. It may not be the greatest action film ever, but it is better than "The Day After Tomorrow!"<br /><br />The current DVD presents a commentary track and a twelve-minute featurette. A 2-Disc Collector's DVD Edition is coming out in May. I suggest you wait for that one to buy it! It will be more loaded than this DVD!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+</p></body></html>

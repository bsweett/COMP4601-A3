<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly solid remake"></head><body><p>To say the idea of remaking George Romero's all time classic Dawn of the Dead drew a simultaneous groan from horror fans (including this one) is an understatement, but Zack Snyder's big budget remake is a surprisingly solid and fun zombie apocalypse.  Bloody, tension filled, and even filled with surprise twists and turns, this Dawn of the Dead has far exceeded my expectations, and the nicely assembled cast (including Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phifer, Jake Weber, Ty Burrell, Kevin Zegers, and Michael Kelly, as well as cameos from original Dawn stars Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger, and FX wizard Tom Savini) does solid work.  James Gunn's screenplay also includes many odes to the original, and even though it does in no way shape or form work character development magic like the original, it doesn't try to, and it's all the more enjoyable for it.  There are those who will no doubt scream blasphemy (most likely the same people who turned their noses against the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake), but this new Dawn is an enjoyable horror fix.  One last thing to Hollywood though: stop remaking classic horror films while you're still ahead.  Not too long ago I heard about a Hills Have Eyes remake, and that idea alone doesn't sit too well with me; what's next, a remake of Last House on the Left?  I really hope not.</p></body></html>

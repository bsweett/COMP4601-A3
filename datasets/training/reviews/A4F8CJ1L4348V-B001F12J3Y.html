It is a very simple but also a complex movie with only one message and that is "believe". If you believe in something strong enough, you will get what you want. You can't get anything in life if you don't believe in what you want, so "believe". Not knowing anything about this movie before I watched it except that it is a christmas movie, I was totally suprised that it didn't have this "religious" statement attached to it. I commend the author and director of this movie for that "freedom". I highly recommend this movie to everyone that wants to watch a very moving movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This film had no impact on me"></head><body><p>The last scene was stellar but tell me, is that all that matters?<br /><br />United 93 has a clueless start (the airports, the staff, the government talks) and a great,great build up to a "napoleon dynamite" of a conclusion. It didn't sell consequence but tries to sell heroic significance which I can learn to respect. However, I must say, 9/11 was not a good day and it changed my world as much as it changed yours. United 93, even with a grizzling build up - failed to remotely emotivate me. It was emotionally impotent and quite a few strands (namely - the character build up, the understanding transferred to the audience) were strayed about.<br /><br />The reason I had big expectations from this film is because the particular incident changed a lot of things about our planet. It changed the way we Asians are welcomed in the west (Security checks, dubious random checkings by authorities,etc) , 9/11 brought the world closer and made the minorities more recognizable, a sense of cold dread adulterated with friendly humanity from all sides - - all in all, fills the world today. I had difficulty understanding how exactly the staff realized that the plane had been hijacked. There were a few loopholes I can overlook but the film really disappointed me. The acting is good but the direction, I feel, should have been more subtle yet impacting.<br /><br />Sorry, this film just didn't manage to move me.<br /><br />Harkanwar Singh Anand<br /><br />New Delhi, India</p></body></html>

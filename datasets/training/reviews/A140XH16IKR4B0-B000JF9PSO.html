<meta name="summary" content="Sensitive anatomy of a tragedy"></head><body><p>Using naturalistic language and a dearth of narrative tricks like foreshadowing, "United 93" shows how 9/11 developed from the POV of the hijackers, passengers on the plane, the flight controllers and the military personnel trying to get fighters into the air. I know the film was carefully scripted and blocked, but the sense you get is of the confusion and lack of coordination on the ground from men and women trying their best to grapple with a situation they were not prepared for. On the plane, each passenger is lovingly recreated by actors, though there is no attempt to exactly replicate situations or conversations. Even the hijackers were given realistic personalities, being jumpy, nervous and menacing as the occasion demanded.<br /><br />The bonus materials were great, with interviews where family members told of their loved ones and got to meet the actors playing them.<br /><br />If it didn't happen this way, it was pretty darned close.</p></body></html>

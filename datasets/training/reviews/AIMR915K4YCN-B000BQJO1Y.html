<meta name="summary" content="Attention Shoppers! (aka: Apocalypse Chow)..."></head><body><p>The dead are still rising! It's been ten years since "Night Of The Living Dead", when things seemed to be under control. Nope, the dead have continued their rampage, killing and eating us normal folks like so many zombie-treats! Our major cities are under marshall law. The military is fighting a losing battle against the flesh-eating hordes, while the media debates the issue. Meanwhile, two cops and two media personel pile into a helicopter to escape to... where?? They have no real idea. Flying over the countryside, they witness the great "hillbilly zombie hunt" below, as bands of good ol' boys drink beer, shoot zombies, drink more beer, shoot more zombies, etc. Later, our heroes land to gas up the helicopter, where they encounter a handful of shambling dead. The dead are of course, easily dispatched by blows / shots to the noggin, but they prove to be dangerous nonetheless! Even two kid-zombies are relentless in their pursuit of warm human flesh! Our four survivors get fueled up and take off again. Then, in the distance, like an oasis of safety, is a gigantic shopping mall! The helicopter lands on the roof, and our small group enters through a sky-light. Upon checking things out, they find the mall to be a veritable fortress, even though slow-moving zombies roam around both inside and out. The four soon create their own home-away-from-home, killing as many dead-heads as possible along the way. They get pretty comfy in their newfound kingdom of the living. Along comes a caravan of bikers to spice things up! They break into the mall, shooting and smacking zombies with sledgehammers, and basically causing mayhem. Our four heroes must lay low until the bikers get tired of playing around. Oh no! One of the four, named Steve, can't take it, and simply must defend "his" mall! He shoots at the marauding bikers, and things get ugly from there! See, no one's noticed that the zombies have been flooding in and now out-number the bikers by about ten to one. In their subtle, creeping way, they sneek right up and take over. ATTENTION SHOPPERS! IT'S BIKER-GANG GUTS DAY AT THE MALL! Can our four heroes endure to the end? I won't give away the climax. DOTD belongs on every horror shelf! A bloody, entrail-filled masterpiece...</p></body></html>

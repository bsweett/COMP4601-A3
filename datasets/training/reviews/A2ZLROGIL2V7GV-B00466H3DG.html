However, when you realize that this is written by Charlie Kaufman (who also wrote "Adaptation" and "Being John Malkovich"), then you know that this will be a very different movie.  This is such an enjoyable, hilarious and a brutally honest film that has immediately become a favorite of mine.<br /><br />Jim Carrey plays "Joel;" a quiet and shy person who keeps to himself most of the time.  He's bummed out when he discovers that his girlfriend had a new procedure done in where she has erased him from her memory.  Not knowing what else to do, Joel decides that he must get the same thing done to him and goes to the clinic to have her erased from his memory, hoping that the pain and sadness will go away.  When he's undergoing the procedure, unconscious and reliving the memories as they are being erased, Joel begins to realize that there were some very happy moments he had with her and he doesn't want to lose them after all.<br /><br />It's really hard to categorize a movie like this.  While it is indeed a comedy on some levels, it has a lot of dramatic elements to it, as well.  Because of this, people will either fall in love with it or despise every minute of it.  What really struck home with me is how honest and creative it really is.  You'll find a lot more honesty and truth in "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" than in most of the "cute" comedies that are out there today.  It is extremely easy to relate to the characters, and that is what makes it all the more realistic for us.  Jim Carrey is absolutely fantastic in this, as he is very controlled and doesn't try to steal the show.  This is when you really get to see his acting skills shine.  Kate Winslet takes the challenge of playing opposite of Carrey head-on and succeeds every single time.  We cannot forget about Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson, who also make the movie that much more entertaining.<br /><br />What I really admire about the movie is the theme of it, and that is that just because a relationship doesn't work out in the end, it doesn't mean that it was time wasted.  Sure, there are certain memories we wish would go away somehow, but how would that change us as a person if we could do such a thing?  We learn from our experiences; from the good and the bad.  That's how we mature as human-beings, and Kaufman's clever writing really establishes that perfectly.  The DVD has some cool extras, such as behind-the-scenes documentaries, audio commentary from the writer and the director, deleted scenes and more.<br /><br />"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" remains the best film to come out of 2004 for me.  It's strange, yet clever; funny yet sad, and imaginative, yet honest.  If you're looking for a risk-taking film that is like a breath of fresh air, then I highly recommend this excellent picture.  This can possibly be the best movie of Jim Carrey's career.  Take a chance and find out why so many people are raving about it in the first place. -Michael Crane</p></body></html>

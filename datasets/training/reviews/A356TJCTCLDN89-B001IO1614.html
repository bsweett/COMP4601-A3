If this was the story of 002 or 006 I'd be satisfied with it but it's not and I wasn't. A couple of things bothered me. First, why is Bond, a 00 man on a such a simple mission when he falls into enemy hands? Where was the fun? Bond movies are supposed to be escapist thrill rides. Bond hardly gets to put on his tux. Die Another Day was darn near grim throughout. MI6 does several sloppy things before and after Bond's mission that don't make sense. Q makes only a tiny appearance and Moneypenney is appallingly miscast. <p>What's good about the movie? Pierce Brosnon. He makes you forget the Timothy Dalton years completely. Halle Berry is a classic gorgeous Bond girl whose also quite capable of kicking butt on her own. Judi Dench as the frostiest M ever, and we finally get a villain whose crazy and evil enough to stand in the same room as the classic Bond villains. The Cuba and Iceland scenes are  quite good too. <p>Ultimately too much of the Bond legend is left on the cutting room floor. This wasn't much more than an oridnary spy flick. I liked it mostly but it wasn't a Bond film.</p></body></html>

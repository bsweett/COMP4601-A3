<meta name="summary" content="3 1/2 STARS / Suspend disbelief & this movie can be creepy as hell !"></head><body><p>If your a gullible person!?! then this dramatic thriller might change the out-look of your tiny god fearing existence! If your like me and gods,devils & demons are no more real to you than 'Freddy Krueger''Chucky' & the Easter bunny then you should enjoy "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" for the fright factor wich is a pretty damn good factor in this film & just try to look past the shallow religious message. The EXORCIST is a masterful landmark horror movie! This film is just a very good dramatic thriller! The evil that the human mind creates is as evil as evil gets!"FACT" This young girls belief system is what killed her.</p></body></html>

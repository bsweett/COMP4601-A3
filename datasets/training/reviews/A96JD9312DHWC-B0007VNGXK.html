<meta name="summary" content="Note to Nazis: Never Trust a Mad Monk"></head><body><p>In the search for wonder weapons, the Nazis allowed themselves to listen to a certain man by the name of Rasputin. Many people would know him as "the mad monk" or other terms, but the Nazis only saw a way t make a quick buck. I wish the movie could have brought about how he survived his fall better, how the seven didn't just have the power but there was also a certain witch named Baba Yaga that had quite the way with this world, but movies can only do so much. This movie did quite a bit, too, taking many of the things fromt he first ansd second graphic novel and giving them to an audience that wants. Mignola said that the answers he gave here made him feel a little bad, too, so the graphic novel readers were rewarded by getting explanations they may have otherwise found themselves without. In my world, that's a win-win on both fronts.<br /><br />As far as the movie fgoes, it had a little bit of everything. There were the fables that mixed with the Hellboy flavor, introducing Nazis that readers would recognize but adding them with a twist. Seeing these things move on the screen was beautiful, too, because i really didn't expect so much from Hellboy going into the primetime. Still, add a great director, imput from the writer, and Ron P. (the only person i can see being Hellboy) and you have yourself a set-up. Then add in other things like the CGi that blended in beautifully, Chtulu-spawned beasts that were shout outs by both director and writer, and you have yourself a great story. It has pieces that make it a little bit of eveything, too, from the coedy styling of a joke here or a beast there and you have youself something that shines on the screen.<br />In the beginning I had my reservations, too, but the end product made me a happy camper.<br /><br />For fans of the series, this is a great thing. From people who do not know anything about the series, it is something grerat with a title that echoes the Pulp comic days of yore. There are all sorts of things that are good to have here, garnering high priase from someone that has followed ( and reviewed) almost everything that has Hellboy in its pages. And I loved what was made here, much to my surprise.<br />Heavily recommended.</p></body></html>

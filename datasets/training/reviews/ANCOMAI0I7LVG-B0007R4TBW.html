<meta name="summary" content="A shockingly forgettable state of mind..."></head><body><p>Continuing on in my `all things Sarsgaard' I'm actually getting to one of his greatest performances; yet sadly it is not in one of his better films.<br /><br />Coming off as more of a gimmick than anything substantial, `Garden State' is one of those cult films with very rabid and devoted fans as well as very cruel and hatful detractors.  I am one on the fence.  I enjoy the film, and I remember when it came out I actually loved it and found it an amalgam of jovial fun; but as the years have gone by my adoration for the film has melted away to uncover a mere toleration of it.  It remains one of those clever films that, over time, proves itself less clever and more pretentious and even superficial.<br /><br />The film follows an actor who is distanced from his former life only to get thrust back in when his mother dies.  Nine years removed from all he used to know he is know stuck in a town he wants to forget, with an angry father and aimless friends and an intriguing girl who holds the key to release his inner contentment.<br /><br />I really like Zach Braff as an actor.  In fact, even here I really like him.  In fact, to be honest, the acting in this film is rather remarkable from all parties.  The thing is, Zach doesn't understand how to make a complete story.  He was so focused on creating a visually appealing film complete with `hip' music and clever tricks that he lost focus on creating a moving STORY.  It is generic and serviceable, but it becomes overwhelmed by the visual impact of the film.  I do wholly believe that some of the best films are built around beautifully constructed sequences of memorable events, even if those events are mere images that burrow themselves in our mind and keep us in rapt attention, but where `Garden State' fails to live up is in the area of cementing those `sequences' with heartfelt purpose.<br /><br />The film winds up becoming forgettable.  I remember the pool sequence (a sublime example of `beautifully constructed sequences') but I don't know why (thus proving that it wasn't a `memorable event').<br /><br />Like I said, the acting is sublime.  Natalie Portman was nominated for an Oscar this year for her work in `Closer'.  Both her performances are vastly different and both are career highlights for her.  She is stunning here as the hyper Sam, an intriguing character with flaws and demons of her own.  To me though, this film belongs to Sarsgaard, who just shimmers in all sorts of glory as the aimlessly charismatic Mark.  He steals every scene he is in and just proves that a great performance can help carry a rather shallow film.  When you couple this with his breathtaking work in `Kinsey' it becomes clear that Sarsgaard was the man in 2004.<br /><br />How Oscar eludes him still is baffling to me.<br /><br />So, I can understand the draw for this film, but I strongly feel that the love for it is blind.  It is visually compelling, and the acting is stellar, and that soundtrack is very, very likable; but the lack of substance becomes apparent ones the glossy veneer fades away and we are left with only half the movie we vaguely remember enjoying.</p></body></html>

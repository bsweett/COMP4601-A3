<meta name="summary" content="Perhaps an unlikeable lady, but a perfectly impressive performance"></head><body><p>Half of this look at Margaret Thatcher's life is engrossing. Half is slow going. Without Meryl Streep's performance as Thatcher, this movie would never have reached take-off speed.<br /><br />The engrossing part gives us Thatcher's determination to make a difference, to gain power as a woman playing what had been a man's game, and to use power with supreme confidence. We're given all too brief looks at her decision-making process as prime minister, her deliberate steps to scale back the welfare state Britain had become, her cool facing down the coal miners and her refusal to do anything but fight vigorously to re-claim the Falklands. When she says "Sink it!" regarding the Argentine ship the Belgrano, there's no doubt about the quality of steel in her spine. Her domination of her cabinet ministers is so amusing a person is glad he's not one of them.<br /><br />The slow going is due to all the time spent reminiscing (this is the frame of the movie) in old age as she sinks into dementia. Sad but true that Margaret Thatcher's rise to power and her years as prime minister are fascinating. Margaret Thatcher as wife, mother and in old age isn't.<br /><br />For a pungent view of life with Thatcher, you won't do better than to read Alan Clarke's three-volume diary. He was one of her ministers. For well-written, entertaining gossip, shrewd observations and satisfying irony about high-placed Brits, particularly in politics, the arts and government, Harold Nicolson's diaries, 1907 to 1963, should not be missed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Doooomed!  You're all doooomed!"></head><body><p>Hard to beleive this movie came out almost a quarter of a century ago.  Friday the 13th came out in 1980, the same year as The Fog, The Shining, He Knows You're Alone, Motel Hell, Mother's Day, and Prom Night.  I remember this because my friends and I would pour over various horror rags, Fangoria and such, and talk about all the movies we wanted to see, and Friday the 13th was near the top of all our lists.<p>Although this movie has lost a little of it's intensity from previous viewings, it's still a great little movie (or big movie if you look at all the sequels it spawned).  It's the story of a bunch of teenagers going to work at a summer camp that had been closed down for a number of years and dubbed 'Camp Blood' by local residents.  Like 20 years prior, there had been a couple of grisly murders, and subsequent fires and such, but no one was ever caught or charged with the crimes.  The teenagers are hired to help fix the camp up, and get it ready to open for the summer.  Throughout the beginning of the movie, the onminus threat of evil slowly rises.  One of my favorite scenes is when the local loon named Crazy Ralph warns one girl on her way to the camp.  "You're doooomed!  Doooomed!"  The local residents pass him off as crazy, but they all have reservations about the camp re-opening.<p>Well, the murders begin, one by one, but so does the mystery.  Who is doing the killing?  And why?  Watch for a young Kevin Bacon to get it in a particularly nasty way.  And as for Ned, played by Mark Nelson, I can't say I was sorry to see him go, as he was played as the 'funny' guy, but just came off as really annoying.  And it seemed odd to me that he was one of the first to get killed, but no one seemed to miss him until much later in the movie.  Oh well...  All this leads up to the climatic surpise ending where we find out who the killer is and why.  But is it the end?  What I really liked about this movie was the ending, and how it was left open.  Did Alice dream about what happened on the lake or did it really happen?  The sequels kind of spoiled this haunting question, and so I avoid them, as this is the best in the series.  By the way, I'm not a big fan of slasher movies, but I feel this one, like the original Halloween movie, had more to offer in not only horror, but mystery and suspense, unlike their respective sequels which just became all about the body count.</p></body></html>

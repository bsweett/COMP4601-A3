I was aware of the cartoon, but I had never seen it before watching this film.  The film is certainly manga influenced, which may turn a lot of people off.  Despite a really good cast, the acting is flat for the most part.  The technology is stylish, but impractical for the most part.  Good for a cartoon or comic, but it comes off poorly in a live action movie.  The story is a pretty straightforward tale with a minor twist that I saw coming.  I would say this is for only the die hard fans.</p></body></html>

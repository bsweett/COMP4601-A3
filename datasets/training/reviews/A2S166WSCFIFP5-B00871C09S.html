<meta name="summary" content="Hitch at his chilling best"></head><body><p>Rear Window is one of the classic Hitchcock films, made in the latter part of his career, where he could almost do no wrong. It ranks up there with Psycho, The Birds, Vertigo, North By Northwest, The Man Who Knew Too Much, and in my opinion the only movie of Hitch's that is better than Rear Window is North By Northwest. Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly give one of their better performances. The action in this movie takes place in Stewart's apartment or viewed from his apartment. Stewart plays a photographer who has broken his leg and is pretty much immobile (the cast is from the pelvis to foot) and witnesses what he suspects to be a murder. The film can be truly horrifying. Imagine what it would be like to watch a man attack the woman you love (there is only one way a man should be allowed to put his hands on Grace Kelly) from your window and not being able to do anything about it. Or having a hulking man (the size of Raymond Burr) coming to kill you and not being able to flee or adequately defend yourself. It gives a level of creepiness that you won't find outside of Psycho or The Birds. Rear Window is one of Hitch's more chilling works. <p>The DVD gives a better picture and sound quality over VHS and it is nice to be able to skip around the movie quickly. Unfortunately there is no commentary, but with Hitch dead and virtually no action who would be the logical choice? Probably better that no one attempts a commentary. In addition to trailers and production stills there are production notes, which give you that little bit of trivia that you can use to impress your friends with. There is also a featurette "conversation with screenwriter John Michael Hayes" which is interesting. And an hour long documentary titled "Rear Window Ethics" which is a commentary on the film (including audio interview excerpts with Hitchcock) and Restoring the Film. The two added featurettes are a definite plus for the DVD. Also, if you have a DVD-ROM on your computer you can get to a copy of the screenplay, which plays the section of the movie (in a little box in the corner) that you are reading. Makes for a nice addition to your DVD collection.</p></body></html>

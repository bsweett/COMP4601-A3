<meta name="summary" content="An Excellent Idea to Bring a True Classic Into the Current Century!"></head><body><p>This is not just a dvd of the original full feature length animated movie of the 1930s but is a whole entertainment device all by itself.  In addition to the full length feature remastered both audio and visually, we get interactive games, many documentaries, radio broadcasts, a Barbara Streisand music video of a remake of "Some Day My Prince Will Come" and many "hidden" links that will provide your youngster with hours upon hours of entertainment.<br /><br />Disney has hit upon a great way to make the DVD more than just a passive medium and has fully exploited all the ways to bring out the full potential of this powerful new medium.  I just wonder how much better this would be once they get around to putting this on the Blu-ray platform!  For adults like me, I still found myself fully enjoying this DVD and especially for the well remastered visuals and the Dolby 5.1 surround sound option in addition to the old mono original.<br /><br />This Platinum Edition Series is a brilliant idea that is very well executed by Disney and it leaves me very interested in getting all the other movies in this series such as "Beauty and the Beast" as well.<br /><br />Full value for money and well worth getting for your kids.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Film. Streep blows me away."></head><body><p>Oh this was one good movie; One wallop of a movie; I came fully prepared to hate Hoffman's character. But along the way, especially when he was talking to Sis James' character, I couldn't help but notice the fact that he had a soft gentle side; I may be wrong but as an African American woman, I just saw a sensitive kind hearted priest that tried to befriend a boy in his parish who happens to be black and caught his own hell in the movie. In the end, when Streep brought out her hand to Sister James, I was like she brought a trump card and fully expected to play it. When he told her he knew people, and she simply said, "You will lose" I was blown away by that. This is a nun in the Catholic church telling a priest that in spite of his statue and job, she will fight him if necessary. It was then that I felt that somehow this man was being falsely accused; I saw the emotions on the man's face and to me, I saw no guilt only pain. For a while I saw it, but to be honest, we will never know if she was right in her accusations. I can also see why Viola Davis' role was considered for an Oscar as well. You want to say, Lady wheres your head? but on the other hand, considering the fact that hes already catching his own hell at home, you have to say is this worth it? is it?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A delightful film well worth seeking out. And the pies are so tasty."></head><body><p>What a great little find this "indie" was on DVD! It came and went in the theaters in the major cities and - hopefully - will be discovered on DVD by word of mouth.<br /><br />This film IS Keri Russell - whose been around for a while, though this is the first time I've seen her. She is on the screen in nearly every scene and makes you really care about her and her pregnancy (unplanned). The father of her child - as played by Jeremy Sisto - is probably the one uninteresting character in the film but he's crucial to the plot. He is a slacker and - personally - I found him annoying whenever he appeared in a scene. But I guess that's the point the film is trying to make.<br /><br />There's a back story of course about this film. It's "creator" Writer-Director, and even star in a significant role, Adrienne Shelly died shortly after the film was made. (There's even a charitable foundation set up in her name to help young female film directors.). The bonus featurettes are nicely done and we get to see Shelly at work.<br /><br />Give this one a chance. Watch it without knowing very much about it and you'll be hood. "Quiet" is a word to comes to mind. And it's not unlike the fascinating Oscar nominated film "Junebug" in its style and even parts of it's storyline.<br /><br />And - one extra word of advice: Don't watch this while you are hungry! The constant mention of mouth-watering pies will send you into hunger pangs before you get to its conclusion.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></body></html>

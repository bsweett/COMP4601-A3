GET A LIFE!<br /><br />Though biased, since I didn't exactly love the first Iron Man, I can safely assume I am not alone when I say this was a complete disappointment. Like many others, the superhero genre is one I watch in earnest, never criticizing it for comedic relief, stellar effects, and villains that make Lugosi look like an infant. Still, we have all been let down by the recent slew of crap that has been parading in theaters for the past several summers, and this release proves studios are just done trying to keep us from getting pissed off. Strong words, but the fact that there is an actual scene where Stark pretends to crap himself in the suit (oh yes, this happens) makes for a perfect example of laziness. The final battle is definitely better than the anticlimactic one from the previous film, but it's the only interesting thing about the movie. Less action this time, and more emphasis on Stark's struggles, not all that interesting considering the plot holed story (Nick Fury isn't indicated in SHIELD until he's on screen for at least ten minutes, leaving people in the dark to who the hell he is.) and bogus comedy, which is as immature as the racist robots from Transformers 2; a decent comparison, to be quite frank. Stay far away from this Marvel fiasco<br /><br />let's take everything that was good about the first one and do it bigger!! forget character development! the best part of this movie was when Tony finds the message from his father that says "You were my greatest creation." That right there was the only redeeming quality of the screenplay i could find. i felt like they were trying to do too many things with this film, just like spider man 3. after this, i don't want to hear anymore complaining about spiderman 3 because this movie has the same exact problems and no one puts this film on blast like they do spider man 3!! another problem i had is that all the battle scenes are in the lamest locations! Tony's luxury apartment that looks like a night club? i don't want to see iron man face off with war machine in a night club looking luxury apartment. that is lame. out of all the locations on this planet they pick a luxury apartment. also not enough mickey rourke!! i hated the whole Hammer scheme thing, i felt like i was watching a movie from Fox news!! yuck! also why is black widow in this? she serves no purpose other than to have fans say "hey that's black widow!" her role was empty and hollow. also what's with the director giving himself his own action scene?! stay behind the camera fatty!! i didn't pay to see a white man in a tux fight, i paid to see iron man!!!! also the way Tony addresses the court or investigators was sooooo far fetched it was like "c'mon nobody can talk like that to an official." also how convenient was it for tony to wirelessly send satellite projections across the screen during that investigation. it was like c'mon!!! at least try to be creative in presenting your information. i hate it when characters magically do computer hacks when in reality it's far more complicated than that!! also the way Don took Tony's suit was soooo lame, almost like how your kid brother goes into your closet when your not looking to take your clothes. so Tony has all this high tech stuff but can't put a lock on his war machine suit?! this is Don, "Tony give up the suit." this is Tony, "No." don then goes into Tony's closet and steals it like it was a polo shirt. THAT DEFINITLY WAS NOT HOW MY DREAM BATTLE BETWEEN TONY AND WAR MACHINE WAS SUPPOSE TO BE!!!!!there was something also about how Tony was carrying himself in this film, as if his road to redemption in the first film never happened;he just went right back to being a narcissitic capitalistic pig. point blank, this movie sucked and i only gave it 2 stars for the cinematography. poor writing, poor set locations, poor directing, and the worst final showdown of all time!! bad guy is beaten with a tag teaming fart, plew! mickeys dead...</p></body></html>

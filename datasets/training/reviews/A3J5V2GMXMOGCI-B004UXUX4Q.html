<meta name="summary" content="Clooney does a terms-of-endearment bit..."></head><body><p>Clooney does a good job carrying this picture - much the same way he made a name for himself on TV doing a doctor show.  The picture is reminiscent of other successful bourgeois melodramas like KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER, ORDINARY PEOPLE and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, albeit more of a one-man show.  DESCENDANTS is least interesting when it focuses on the supporting characters, particularly the smarmy daughters and the goofy boyfriend of the oldest.  After a promising opening narration, the story breaks down simply because Clooney seems way too smart to have a wife and kids like the ones depicted.  It simply doesn't ring true because Clooney is too cool to fall victim to this kind of TV-drama, midlife crisis.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Our unbelievably true future"></head><body><p>A strange remake of many films and many books of science fiction. Brave New World, 1984, Brazil, Total Recall, the Running Man, Terminator, and so many others. The basic crime here is to feel. How can we get rid of feelings in order to guarantee social peace and complete control of everyone and everything? The question is the answer.<br /><br />A drug will do the job everyday and destroying anything that could resemble any feeling or their carriers will do the job every night, and we are covered day and night. But what happens in any society? Some do not like drugs and compulsory acts. So they rebel and they stop taking their drugs. And that is called the resistance.<br /><br />In Brave New World they are tolerated in some human reservation, but in this world they are underground and have to fight against the official society overground. And there will always be one secret agent of the feeling police who will rebel one day and will get in touch with the resistance and will be the instrument of the end of this world. That's part of life and no one can prevent it.<br /><br />So the film is a little bit na?ve on the means with which one man, even a cleric of super power and strength, can succeed in killing dozens of trained soldiers in about two minutes without even getting a rip in his coat. It yells impossible but we are a good audience and we suspend our disbelief long enough to know that this rebellion is absolutely possible and that it exists in any totalitarian system.<br /><br />The only pass&eacute; element is that the power of "free" information is not captured in this film which is already old and cannot know the power of the new medium called the Internet and the way even the best kept secrets in the world can be made public tomorrow morning by Wikileaks or any other eaves dropping site.<br /><br />But apart from that it is an entertaining film and I like the dog, the mongrel, the BO of this film that was made even before that famous BO was elected President of the United States who brought a dog named Bo into the White House along with two young girls.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></body></html>

It has a superior cast in which each star pulls his or her own weight and then some.  It also has a very clever script that will leave you guessing until the very end and a wonderful score by Philip Glass that is perfect for this period piece.  In addition, the photography and special effects all work in enhancing this story.  My entire family enjoyed this film and applauded it at the end when we viewed it in our home theater.  That is a rare event in my house.  We just rented this film and now they all insist I run out and buy it immediately.<br /><br />If you like romance that isn't overtly sexual (no nudity -but a little suggestive), crime that isn't overly graphic (a minor blood scene), and a plot that you can sink into and literally say "that movie was an experience", then this movie is probably for you.</p></body></html>

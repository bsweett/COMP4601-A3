<meta name="summary" content="Much better than the novel"></head><body><p>I know that millions of people read the novel and many of us felt cheated and manipulated throughout that book. The silly concept of the "speed plane" that flies from Boston to Geneva in like 4 hours warns the reader that the book is going to be VERY dumb. I can honestly say that this movie is better than the book and in fact is a decent action movie. Ron Howard thankfully cut the silly airplane part and removed the sexual tension between the "bad guy and the girl", which was also silly and unnecessary in the book. Also, a character who dies in the book surives in the film and I think that change gives the viewer more hope and encouragement for a positive outcome while still being suspenseful. Han Zimmer's amazing score and some stunning cinematography make this movie worth seeing, despite the far-fetched plot. Truly, this is one of the very few moments when I can say that the film is much better than the book and not the other way around.</p></body></html>

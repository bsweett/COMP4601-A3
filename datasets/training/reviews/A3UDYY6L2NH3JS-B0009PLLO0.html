<meta name="summary" content="Good entertaining trip in warfare and landscapes"></head><body><p>An interesting film to spend nearly three hours in action and beautiful scenes. Beauty is probably the best characteristic of this film : sandscapes, landscapes, urbanscapes (the famous Babylon of course and some other cities), mountainscapes and even some junglescapes. The plot is simple. Royal family strife with polygamy and jealousy, poisonings and executions, etc A lot of warfare to conquer an empire against those foreigners which translates into Greek as barbarians, and some amusing and amazing battles with elephants, camels and other interesting equipment. A marvellous black horse : the best actor in the film actually. Then a lot of plotting among the generals of this enormous army and a king who will be poisoned when he is finally back in Babylon, and his empire will be torn apart by wars since all the generals want to have a slice of it. Nothing particularly fascinating. One element though comes out. It takes seven years for the conqueror of Babylon to be finally defeated and to go home, and altogether eight years for him to die. That number of eight is maybe an allusion to another war around Babylon, but who is going to see it really ? The character of Alexander is not particularly explored in details. He has little culture, except a little bit of mythology. He thinks he is some kind of God or demi-God, a descendent of Zeus, Achylles, Herakles or Hercules maybe too, and he is typical of his time : a least three wives and quite a lot of manly love but it is all very well wrapped up and embraced with a lot of both directness and chastity. Only the statues are nude. Don't expect more than that. We all know the rest about this Greek culture of old. Good entertainment even for the whole family.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Taking Revenge to a New Level"></head><body><p>Talk about taking revenge of the criminal justice system to a new level, that is basically what this movie is about.  But instead of it being a past defendant who gets out of prison, it is just the opposite, a victim who is upset with the way the system treated his attackers.  Overall the movie was ok in my opinion, got a little bored in the middle of it, yet the beginning and end were quite interesting.  Some graphic bloody scenes which I thought were a little too much and could have done without them.  It's a different type of criminal law movie and I would not compare it to say, A Few Goood Men or The Lincoln Lawyer, but if you like movies about courts and the judicial system, then would think you could enjoy it.<br /><br />Peter J.

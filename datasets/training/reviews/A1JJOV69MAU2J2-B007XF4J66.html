This movie has more classic lines than just about any other ever made -- 'Round up the usual suspects', for example. Add to that great actors, starting with Bogart, who really makes this movie. His character is magnetic, compelling, bold and yet tender. Fabulous. Claude Rains as the chief inspector brings humor, wit and a sly intelligence to the role. Watching Bergman is watching the prototype for movie heroines of the golden age... The story itself, from 1942, was ahead of its time, talking about concentration camps in a way that seems almost cliche now but was the first script of its kind then. The bad guys -- hey, they're Nazis! You don't get better bad guys than that. As for the DVD, it's a really, really good print that looks great, with improved sound and an extended making of featurette that was originally made for VHS. Bottom line: This should be in everybody's movie collection.</p></body></html>

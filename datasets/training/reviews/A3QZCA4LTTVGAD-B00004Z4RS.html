<meta name="summary" content="More than just a sci-fi action spectacle"></head><body><p>In the near future, a new breed of humans--known as mutants--begins to emerge from the general population. Gifted (or cursed, depending on one's standpoint) with a variety of extranormal abilities, these mutants face fear and distrust from society. But under the leadership of Professor Charles Xavier, a group of these mutants has banded together to help light the path to a better future for both mutants and normal humans. This is the premise of &quot;X-Men.&quot;<p>Director Bryan Singer and screenwriter David Hayter faced a daunting task in taking the massive X-Men mythos (which has evolved through decades of different comic book titles, and has involved an encyclopedic number of characters) and adapting it into a feature film. But, together with a superb international cast, the filmmakers succeed brilliantly.<p>A prologue set during the Nazi Holocaust sets the overall serious tone for the film--a welcome change from the increasingly campy and ridiculous &quot;Batman&quot; film franchise. Yes, &quot;X-Men&quot; is a science fiction film with plentiful action and special effects. But at its heart, this film is an intelligent drama about characters who face crises and challenges.<p>Professor Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) squares off against Magneto (Ian McKellen), a rival mutant leader with a radically different philosophy. Add to this struggle Bruce Davison as a McCarthyesque, mutant-hating U.S. senator, and you have a rich tapestry of ideological conflict which serves as a backdrop for the frequently explosive action. But overall I found the emotional core of the film to lie in the relationship between Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a seemingly indestructible warrior with retractable metal claws, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), a young mutant with the ability to suck the life force out of others. Each of the actors delivers an excellent performance.<p>The mutants of &quot;X-Men&quot; can be seen as metaphors for any feared or persecuted group in human history. Ultimately, the film celebrates the ability of oppressed individuals to overcome alienation, to form supportive communities, and to work for a greater good. It is, I believe, the film's success in tapping into universal human fears, hopes, and ideological conflicts that elevates it above being merely an excellent sci-fi action epic.</p></body></html>

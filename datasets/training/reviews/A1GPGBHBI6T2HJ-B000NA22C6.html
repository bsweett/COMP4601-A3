King IS one of the most creative forces in the world of literature the world has ever known.  Some of his works are pure genius...others...pure drivel.  As 'Secret Window' began, I became quite convinced this was going to be a real treat.  Well filmed.  Suspenseful.  Well acted.  Unfortunately as the movie continued on, and the REAL reason for our main character (played wonderfully by Depp) and his problems with a redneck psychopath who is convinced his story was stolen become apparent, well I began to have flashbacks of the Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />You may wonder just how in the world I can compare these two movies, huh?  Well its quite simple, actually.  Remember Gollum and his strange split-personality and how he would sometimes talk to himself and work to convince himself that the One Ring was HIS?  The portion of 'Secret Window' where Johnny Depp does the same thing kinda weirded me out, and I have to admit, made me think of Gollum right off the bat (and not just me either, my son said the same thing).  Despite this small similarity, at the point where Depp begins to interrogate himself, the entire feel of the film began to seriously deteriorate.  What WAS a fairly decent suspenseful movie suddenly became a parody of itself and almost crashes and burns.  I found the last scene to be really, really odd.  Sure, I got the whole sinister joke of it, I just found it to be very UN-funny.  Not in poor taste, just not funny.  I also found what many people thought was a very clever plot to be quite the opposite, actually.  All I can say is this: the first part of the movie was very well done.  The last part became just plain strange and un-interesting, which is sad because I really wanted to like this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A clever, funny reimagining"></head><body><p>I have never seen any of the original Pink Panther movies.  Well, I did see Son of the Pink Panther, but I don't think that one really counts (I'm sure Roberto Benigni doesn't think so either...).  The trailers for this film were fairly amusing.  Nothing hilarious, but just enough for me to be interested enough to go see it in the theaters.  I was very surprised by the result on screen.  Truthfully, I was expecting a bland, unfunny, offensive display of Hollywood's desparity for new, original ideas.  What I got was a clever, funny remake of what is widely hailed as a classic comedy.<br /><br />The basic plot of The Pink Panther follows the stolen diamond of the same name.  The diamond was supposedly stolen of the dead body of the head coach of France's soccer team.  The head coach is assassinated in the middle of a victory celebration, and the diamond is mysteriously gone from his finger.  Chief of Police Kevin Kline calls in Clouseau so he will have a patsy to screw up the investigation, making him look like the hero, and he will then win his long sought after Medal of Honor.<br /><br />Steve Martin is truly hilarious as Inspector Clouseau.  There were plenty of scene that had me laughing just because of his ridiculously overdone French accent.  Clouseau is stupid.  And that is the basis of most of the jokes throughout the movie, including a lot of physical humor that doesn't work quite as well as the filmmakers would like.  The physical gags were the least funny part of the money, while Steve Martin was what really saved the film.  Just listening to him have a conversation with another character was well worth the admission price.  And really, Martin is the only source of comedy that the film has to offer, so it is really lucky that he is incredibly funny and talented.  Kevin Kline really isn't the funny of an actor, and is given no funny material to work with.  Beyonce is pretty much there for her looks, not her acting ability, and she plays a fairly minor role in the film.  Jean Reno, as Clouseaus's "sidekick" is humorous at moments, but overall he is just another character necessary to complete the movie.<br /><br />Overall, The Pink Panther is worth seeing.  If you are a fan of Steve Martin, you will absolutely love this film, as I believe it his best in a long time (not that it has much to compete with.........Cheaper by the Dozen), and he is obviously the anchor of the film, and the filmmakers know that and milk his character completely dry.  By the end of the film, I actually liked the characters in the movie, and I walked out of the theater genuinely enjoying what I had just seen.  I don't know why the critics hated this film so much, but at least give it a chance, and I guarantee you at least a couple of good laughs.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Weak & Shallow Script (No Pun Intended) Is To Blame, But You Can't Help But Be A Little Entertained"></head><body><p>MOVIE: Wolfgang Petersen has been a pretty consistent director when it comes to big bombastic CGI driven movies. He has never really made an excellent film, but he has done good work.  The Perfect Storm was a good story and handled very well, while Air Force One was an intense thriller that had all the right ingrediants to work so well. Troy was considered by many to be a bad movie, but I found it to have a great vision on Petersen's part that resulted in a very enjoyable blockbuster. Now Wolfgang Petersen hits the screen with his next blockbuster wannabe, Poseidon. A remake of the 1972 The Poseidon Adventure. Nothing new to report here, but remakes never capture the essence of the originals, it just seems like a fact that Hollywood doesn't care about. The film tells the disasterous tale of a cruise ship that gets hit by a rogue wave in the middle of the ocean, and that's about it. The film is a short 1 hour, 48 minutes. Short in terms of movies in the same genre. The script is contrived and full of cardboard characters and wooden dialogue. It's nothing but one clich? after another and just makes excuses to show more amazing CGI and "been there, done that" escape sequences. Sure the movie has incredible CGI and some amazing set design, but at what cost? My rule of thumb is that you cannot sacrifice story for action, which is just what this movie did. The dialogue and the characters were merely lead-ins to the next action sequence. No character development was done, which basically says "okay, don't care about the characters, just watch this ship rollover." Mark Protosevich was the film's screenwriter, and this is only his second screenplay, which shows his lack of experience and really his screenplay is the thorn in this movie's side. Petersen does a great job at directing the action, William Sandell's (Master & Commander) production design is spectacular, and Klaus Badelt's score is intense and in your face. However it is the script, the backbone of a film, that is lacking and thus creates a very lackluster experience.<br /><br />ACTING: When you hear a cast listing like this movie has, you have certain expectations. There is some great talent in the film, but what can you say about the acting if the script is horrible. Some of the lines that are delivered are laughably bad. In one scene Josh Lucas tells Kurt Russell who is a former firefighter, "I work better on my own . . . no offense". In which Russell replies, "None taken". You can't get much better than that.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Is it clich?d? Yes. Has it been done before? Many times. Do we care about the characters? No. However, you can't help but feel a little entertained by the overwritten score by Klaus Badelt and the bombastic CGI scenes as the ship turns belly up. It'll be a good DVD to give your home theater a workout.</p></body></html>

The hipper-than-thou &quot;one-star&quot; contrarians and spiteful naysayers are just insanely jealous of the director's incredibly charmed life (I mean, c'mon...writer for Rolling Stone at 15, several acclaimed films by his early 40's, by all accounts an amiable, down-to-earth guy, married to Rock Babe Extraordinaire Nancy Wilson...he's living every American male's Peter Pan fantasy-I say more power to 'im!). &quot;Almost Famous&quot; joins &quot;Dazed And Confused&quot; as another &quot;American Graffitti&quot; for those of us who reached young adulthood in the mid-70's (but hated Disco!). Crowe coaxes great performances from his ensemble, with standout turns from Billy &quot;Golden God&quot; Cruddup, Frances McDormand and the amazing Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who edges closer to becoming a national treasure with each successive role he tackles). In short, if you know what &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; sounds like with clicks, pops and turntable rumble...then you'll understand exactly what this film is about!</p></body></html>

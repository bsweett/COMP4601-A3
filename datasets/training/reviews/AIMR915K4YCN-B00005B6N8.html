A true anti-hero in a gloriously tense sci-fi epic. PITCH BLACK has Riddick being transported to prison via deep-space ship. Along the way disaster strikes (of course), causing a crash-landing on a strange desert planet. Riddick is among the survivors who soon find that they are quite unfortunately, not alone. Something is alive and has stripped the planet of any / all other lifeforms. Worse still, these insatiable critters only come out at night, which is coming on fast, and lasts for months (years?)! The battle between humans and monsters is both satisfying and convincing, as Riddick rises up to kick some hideous flesh-eater buttocks! The rest of the cast ranges from great (Kieth David, Cole Hauser, etc.) to just plain monster chow. PITCH BLACK takes the best elements of movies like ALIENS and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and melds them together perfectly. The result is a dark, sinister ride through a funhouse where the attractions reach out and tear your head off! Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

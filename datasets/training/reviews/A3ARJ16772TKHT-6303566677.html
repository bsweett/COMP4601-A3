<meta name="summary" content="The Begininator: The Movie that Started it All"></head><body><p>This is a classic movie to the point where it has become a serious cliche. However it is well made and finely paced. The soundtrack is seriously '80s but otherwise fine. Most importantly, however, this movie paved the road for the very excellent second movie.<br /><br />The effects are dated, but they work well enough for the movie because they are shot with competence and an eye towards the end result of the movie.<br /><br />Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton work well together and Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast here in a rare (for him at least) villain role.</p></body></html>

They shine, outshine even almost ever other performer of 2003.  Now I don't know if I was the only one with the missconception that this was a film about drugs, well, it's not.  I mean, Niomi does coke breifly, but other than that drugs has very little, if NOTHING to do with the story line.  The film is shot in panic mode almost, switching from past to present to future to give you the begining and end all at the same time and then filling in the middle slowly so that it all makes sense.  You have Benecio Del Toro, an ex-con turned Jesus freak sort-of is dealing with a grave mistake.  Niomi Watts is dealing with a grave loss and Sean Penn is learning to live again, now that he;s finally given a second chance, a new lot on life.  These three are connected through their new lives, their mistakes and misfortunes until the end which will blow you away and make you cry, at least a little, on the inside maybe...GREAT movie and highly highly recomended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Fog"></head><body><p>John Carpentar created many memorable horror films in the late 70's and 80's. Ive noticed though his music in those films always seems to be the same but in a different key but I digress.<br /><br />The Fog has a unique story, a great atmosphere, and just falls short of great. This film feels rushed as the film barely clocks in at an hour and half. The story barely takes off and its over. I still enjoyed it and it's better then more then 85% of horror movies released today.</p></body></html>

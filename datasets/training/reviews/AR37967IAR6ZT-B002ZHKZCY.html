Matt Damon, once again, looks terrific and acts well enough to give his amnesiac character some distinction.<br /><br /> Also, this film features some incredibly strong supporting work from Brian Cox and the fantastic Joan Allen. Franka Potente and Julia Stiles also make good impressions in this film, though they're both only in it for about five minutes.<br /><br /> The action sequences are pretty high-octane, however much of the camera work and split-second editing function to only give you a vague idea of what's happening onscreen, and I don't know if I could explain the complicated plot that leads to Bourne coming out of hiding.<br /><br /> Still, I &quot;got&quot; the film enough while I was watching it to enjoy the ride.</p></body></html>

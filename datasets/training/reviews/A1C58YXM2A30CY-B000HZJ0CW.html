The story tends to plod along and does not really gel like some of the earlier Trek films.<br /><br />Picard discovers that the Romulans experimented and created a clone of Picard (Jinsan) except this clone was discarded to Remus.  The story centers around family, or tries to.<br /><br />The conflict between brothers, between "siblings" as it were, was a valiant try, but failed for me.<br /><br />The performances fell flat -- the ramming of the ship into the "theta radiation" ship of Jinsan was not the best idea.  The conflicted Data dealing with his Data wannabe.  And Data's final fate was a disappointment.<br /><br />Imagine if you will a director who really wants to off the franchise.  To really make this the last Star Trek film.  The Generation is getting lazy and slow.  The plot devices are getting stale and silly.<br /><br />I feel this film was the final straw for Paramount.  The film was made for fans rather than a wider fan base.<br /><br />And that's why JJ Abram's film Star Trek was the best -- it cleaned up this tired malaise of the Captain, the crew, the explosions, the last minute or else we die plot lines and breathed new life into the franchise.<br /><br />Nemesis is the reason why!<br /><br />Decent performances by Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis.<br /><br />The director Stuart Baird knew nothing of Star Trek or its franchise before this film, so that might explain the cold reception at the box office.  Or that it ran against Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter!!<br /><br />Directed by Stuart Baird<br />Produced by Rick Berman Written by Story:<br />John Logan<br />Rick Berman<br />Brent Spiner<br />Screenplay:<br />John Logan</p></body></html>

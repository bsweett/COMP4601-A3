<meta name="summary" content="Hard Country.."></head><body><p>There are no easy answers supplied in the Coen's adaptation of Comac McCarthy's bleak and unyielding No Country for Old Men, which while commendable for the film's integrity will likewise make it difficult viewing for a general public.  This is a lean and hard tale rendered in spare and uncompromised terms and it refuses to follow whatever direction you might assume it's going.  Stubbornly original and true to its despairing view, this is challenging film work that disobeys the rules and conventions of the genre that encapsulates it.<br /><br />Dominating the film is Javier Bardem's eerie hired killer as remorseless and unrelenting malevolence personified.  There is a tangible sense of dread whenever he is on screen, which is a good deal of the time, and his detached and bemused lethality is both chilling and the perfect metaphor for the anguish over lost values and decency that is at the heart of the film.  Here is total savagery, ruthlessly walking amongst the sane and the civil, unbridled and uncontrollable and impervious to mitigation, negotiation, reason or mercy.  It is a frightening portrait of the violent insanity of our times.<br /><br />And it is the insanity of our times that overwhelms the other characters we come to know.  Josh Brolin's tough Viet Nam vet, stubbornly trying to reverse his hard luck and bring a bit of ease to his sweet wife, nicely played by Kelly MacDonald , with dirty money chanced-upon.  And even more essentially, Tommy Lee Jones' honest and savvy sheriff, dazed and bewildered by the vanishing values of his West Texas heritage and the seemingly bottomless degrees of violence and degradation that have infiltrated and threaten to subsume the world left him by his lawmen grandfather and father.<br /><br />The film bears all the trademarks of the Coen brothers best works:  a tight and lean script; beautiful and essential cinematography from Roger Deakins; wonderful lead characters and great care in the casting of all supporting parts; occasional dark gallows humor; spare and meticulous dialogue; and artful and judicious depictions of unspeakable violence.  Their great craft is evident throughout.<br /><br />Finally, this is a film that is unrelievedly bleak and despairing in its vision and at its heart.  There are no compromises made and no reassuring answers supplied.  In the long coda that ends the film, does Tommy Lee Jones supply a glimmer of hope that light will be found in the darkness, or is he once again simply offering a sad requiem for the lost simple decencies of our fathers?  You decide.  This is superb film-making for those willing to be challenged.</p></body></html>

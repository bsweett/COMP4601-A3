<meta name="summary" content="Problematic Blu-Ray presentation of a decent film"></head><body><p>The Film:<br /><br />"Slumdog Millionaire" presents the Horatio Alger story of Jamal, a young, poor kid in the Bombay/Mumbai slums who endures various trials and tribulations to win a TV quiz show, get the girl, and escape his troubled life.<br /><br />The movie is slick and entertaining in the best Hollywood tradition. It puts the protagonists in various dangers, and has them escape in the nick of time, usually with some comeuppance being delivered to the antagonists. "Slumdog" offers a gritty portrayal of slum life in Mumbai, to the point where I was left wondering how accurate it really was. The relationship between the two brothers (Jamal and Salim) is relatively interesting. The central love story, between Jamal and Latika, strains credulity just a bit.<br /><br />The casting director did a very good job of matching child actors to their older counterparts, and it lends a nice continuity to the story.<br /><br />Overall, the ending is a bit too pat, much like many Hollywood stories. I also found the central conceit, that Jamal succeeds because "it is written" to be troublesome. Isn't this sort of reliance on destiny, social status conferred by birth, and prophecy, the kind of stuff that has held large portions of Indian society back by making them second-class citizens? I am by no means scholar of India's history or society - but I found this notion to be troubling.<br /><br />It's an entertaining movie, but in my opinion it never rises above its material. You can find the same type of story, conflict, and resolution in just about any Hollywood film. A young "nice guy" protagonist makes his way through a tough world, is rewarded by the universe for how swell he is, and gets a happy ending. This one just has "foreign" trappings. I found it to be a sort of poor man's "City of God," a much better film by Fernando Meirelles.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />The image in this transfer is relatively detailed, but it suffers from a wildly fluctuating black level throughout. Some scenes have good contrast, while others (usually in dark locales) exist in a grayed-out fog. I get the impression that this movie was filmed on digital, which doesn't handle low light scenes as well as celluloid. Whatever the reason, it just doesn't look very good during these scenes, which I would say comprise about 30% of the film. In its defense, the Blu-Ray offers a very vibrant and colorful image when it is not subject to the hazy mosquito noise of the darker scenes. At its best, this disc looks very good. It's just not always at its best.<br /><br />The DTS audio mix is also seriously problematic. This film switches between very quiet dialogue scenes and EXTREMELY loud action so quickly, (such as trains, gunshots, car crashes, etc.) it threatens to blow out your speakers. Making things more irksome is the heavily accented English - you need to have the dialogue scenes cranked up to really make them out. Essentially, it is impossible to watch this film without subtitles at a lower volume, because of the drastic changes in volume. This plagues the movie throughout. The center channel dialogue never, ever, ever manages to win in any contest with the front and rear channels. I wish they would have just done the film in Hindi with English subtitles. Then I could turn it down and just read the dialogue. Instead, I am forced to fiddle with the volume control for 2 straight hours, trying to anticipate when the next sudden rushing train noise might occur.<br /><br />Which is not to say that the loud stuff is bad. The sound, especially the music, is very rich and has a lot of surround effects. This is nice. But its dynamic range is just too much for the quiet and tender dialogue scenes. They should have leveled it out better.<br /><br />Extras include some making-of material, two commentaries, a music video, and deleted scenes. It's all very nice, except for that fact that they are presented in 480p. Yawn.<br /><br />************<br /><br />If you've seen it already and you are a fan, the Blu-Ray is a worthy purchase. Its image certainly does things that DVD cannot do in terms of detail. If you have not yet seen it, I would recommend renting first. The image is not very impressive, the sound mix is annoying, and the film itself is pretty average.</p></body></html>

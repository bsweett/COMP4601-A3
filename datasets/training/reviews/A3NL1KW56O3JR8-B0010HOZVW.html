The plot is no secret: victim-becomes-vigilante who not so slowly slides from self-defense to pre-meditated murder. Of course, the people she kills are all one-dimensional s**t-bags for whom the viewer has no sympathy so you're almost tempted to think that what she's doing is right.<br /><br />The best thing I can say is that TBO avoids the clich&eacute; ending I was expecting; kudos for that.</p></body></html>

(After all, it's nothing new. Bunuel's 1977 film That Obscure Object of Desire was the sixth adaptation of Louys' novel Woman and Puppet.) After all, rarely is the remake even watchable, much less on a par with the original.<p>This is one of the exceptions. The new version of The Bourne Identity, directed by Doug Liman of Go fame, contains all the fluff factor of an awful remake yet remains watchable in a turn-your-brain-off way. Jason Bourne is portrayed here by Matt Damon, who shows that he really can be something other than Ben Affleck's geeky best friend. Obligatory love interest Marie is played by indie darling Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), and a well-cast batch of supporting characters keep the acting level higher than one normally gets from this sort of thing while never quite taking themselves too seriously. (The exception to that last bit is Chris Cooper, playing Bourne's boss, but then he's supposed to be a high-strung neurotic.)<p>Good, solid fun from beginning to end. ***</p></body></html>

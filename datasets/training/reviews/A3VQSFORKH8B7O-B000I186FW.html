<meta name="summary" content=""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.""></head><body><p>We here in the United States have been blessed with the right to tell others what our opinions are concerning politics, religion, and other areas of life. While we may disagree with one another, we are still able to live a free life with our own beliefs and lifestyles.<br /><br />But what if that was not the case? What if, instead of living the way you wish, you had to live the way the government tells you to? What if you lived under totalitarian rule, and to speak out against your government was a crime punishable by death? What would you do then? Would you live in fear, or fight against the oppression?<br /><br />This is the question raised by "V for Vendetta," a powerful look at life under total rule, a world similar to George Orwell's "1984." The Wachowski Brothers, coming off the success of their "Matrix" films, have produced a rousing, exciting, and amazing story of one man who decided to fight against the system that left him scarred.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving gives an exceptional performance as V, who uses terrorist tactics against the government, but never against innocent people. Natalie Portman gives another fine performance as Evey, a person whose parents were murdered by the government, and who finds courage with V's help. The rest of the cast, including Stephen Rea and John Hurt, give wonderful supporting performances.<br /><br />The storytelling is fantastic, while the action sequences and visual effects are thrilling and visually-stunning. And while some may question V's actions, his actions rally the people against the corrupt government of Britain in 2020.<br /><br />"V for Vendetta" is a thrilling film, full of exceptional storytelling, great performances, and thrilling action sequences. Fans of the graphic novel will not be disappointed!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A-</p></body></html>

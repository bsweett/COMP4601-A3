<meta name="summary" content="Good film-not outstanding"></head><body><p>This film was good.  I did expect it to be better or funnier.<br /><br />No outstanding music.  But, the Disney/Pixar films have not had the music you expect.<br /><br />Very disappointing not a 2 disc set.  I always like to see makings of stories, behind the scenes information.<br /><br />And, ONCE AGAIN, IT HAS 1 OF THESE HORRIBLE DVD CASES WITH THE TINY FLIP OPEN FLAPS.  THEY ARE TERRIBLE!!</p></body></html>

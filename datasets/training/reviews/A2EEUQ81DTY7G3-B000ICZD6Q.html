<meta name="summary" content="A well-acted, smart satire on the corporate world."></head><body><p>In Good Company would have to be one of the smartest, and satirical movies made about the trials and tribulations of the corporate world in recent years. Part love story and part wry social commentary, In Good Company effectively probes, deconstructs, attacks and, in a strange way, even celebrates corporate greed, and age discrimination. The themes of the movie are common and extremely relevant in a world where globalization has taken workplace security away, where work is now mobile, and where workers are at the impulse of corporate takeovers.<br /><br />Carter Duryea (played by Topher Grace) is a young, ambitious upstart who tosses around buzzwords such as "synergy." Carter recently had a hit with a line of cell phones aimed specifically at children and he so impressed his super conglomerate CEO that he has been promoted to the head of ad sales at the corporation's new flagship sports magazine. Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) is the current boss of the magazine, and his years of experience and his more traditional style of working, have given him years of security along with admiration and respect from his colleagues. He's also blessed with a loving family, which includes his beautiful older daughter Alex (a gorgeous Scarlett Johansson) who is bound for NYU.<br /><br />When Carter becomes Dan's boss, Dan grudgingly adapts to his demotion and the sparks begin to fly as Carter, under order to cut employees and trim budgets embarks on a steady round of firings. It doesn't help that Alex begins to take a steady shine to Carter, when Dan accidentally invites the lonely Carter over for dinner. Carter is smug and hyperactive - he constantly downs cups of coffee to keep his creative energy levels up - but his restlessness is only a front. Underneath lies a fearful and frightened young man who is suffering from a crumbling marriage and yawns for love and fulfillment. Dan, on the other hand, is fifty-two and is about to be a father again.  He has a paternal, world-weary wisdom that has been amassed from years of experience both as a family man and as a worker.<br /><br />The fluid dynamic between Carter and Dan is at the core of the movie. And as their roles shift and evolve, their develops a very special relationship - part father and son, part colleague and mentor. Both men are almost always at odds, sometimes violently so, and the film pulls off the clever trick of keeping both characters completely sympathetic, even when one, the other, or both give in to their piggish and wrong-headed tendencies.<br /><br />In Good Company is film making at its best. With intelligent writing, witty dialogue, and steady direction, director Paul Weitz has made a film that brims cheer and is also quite devastating in its view the harshness of the working world. The characters are all intricate and textured and the actors do a terrific job of bringing out their very human foibles. Dennis Quaid delivers one of the finest performances of his career, and Scarlett Johansson is fabulous to watch as Dan's artistic, fiercely independent daughter. In Good Company is deliciously off-center and has some spot on things to say about ambition, work and office culture. Mike Leonard January 05</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of Kubrick's best next to the Shining  Full Metal Jacket"></head><body><p>This is a classic, I remember the first time I watched this,<br />it left me speechless, mesmerized, angry , sad and happy. Kubrick was a misunderstood genius at times, but everyone can agree a "ClockWork Orange" like "Dr. Stangelove" put him back on the map as a serious director with a vision.<br /><br />This case he takes still a young up and coming actor Malcolm<br />Mcdowell whose career spans from playing one evil villain<br />after the other. The other most notorious he played is of course<br />Caligula but here in this in this white suburban terrorist<br />who with his group spreads violence and terror is outstanding.<br /><br />In a way too, Kubrick was bringing to attention the problem<br />of todays youth, how their misguide, foolisn and with some like Mcdowell's character worthless. These are the types of youth who do the Columbime murders.<br /><br />Eventually Mcdowell's characters pays for his crimes, but thats until he feels the same torture and victimization he did to others. Alexander Large's then and only then really realizes what he has done and its until he feels the same amount of pain that he is truly sorry.<br /><br />In a way too Kubrick's message is that many people despite<br />all the feministic nonsense about rehabilation and sympathy<br />doesnt change dangerous and evil people. Thats obvious in todays age when we have somebody like George W. bush in power and a large growing known of "red" states supporting the evil.<br /><br />This is a must see that you must see time and time again.</p></body></html>

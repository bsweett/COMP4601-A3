<meta name="summary" content="I Like the Previous Ones Better"></head><body><p>For me, this was an odd movie.<br /><br />First, it was dark.  Almost every scene was either dark blue or dark brown, with only glimpses of sun.<br /><br />I realize this is thematic, and symbolizes the dark, almost impossible predicament, the three principals (Harry, Hermione, Ron) are in.<br /><br />Second, it almost entirely lacked the interesting subordinate characters that made the previous Harry Potters so lively: Snape, Voldemort, Dumbledore, Luna, the Malfoys, the rest of the Weasleys, etc., etc. do appear, but briefly--then they are gone.<br /><br />Also thematic, I realize: the isolation and loneliness are deliberately claustrophobic, and intensify the fears and hopelessness of the Big 3.<br /><br />Still, these give the film a closed-in, deprived feel, that, however thematic, make it seem thin and strained.<br /><br />Third, the wedding is given short shrift, while the jealousy-theme goes on interminably.<br /><br />Also thematic, I know: this is the story of growing up, and all the melodrama and angst of being a teenager.<br /><br />Still, all this indicates that the Epic Good-vs.-Evil conflict has taken over the movie, at the expense of everything else.<br /><br />The whimsy, the craziness, the unexpected twists, the fun settings (like Hogwarts and even Harry's horrible foster-family),and the humor are all gone.<br /><br />I suppose this was all deliberate, but it makes for grim watching.</p></body></html>

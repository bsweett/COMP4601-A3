<meta name="summary" content="A Great and Classic Western"></head><body><p>I was fortunate enough to see this movie the first time in 1968, in a drive-in theater.  It seemed to me to be an epic, complex western, and perhaps the best movie I had ever seen in my life at that time.  This movie is epic, it is complex, and is certainly one of the best westerns ever made.<br /><br />Sergio Leone made this movie at a time when Italian movie-makers were known for their intensely artistic visions.  Sergio keeps his movie sufficiently within the mainstream so that the movie is very accessible, yet there are numerous artistic elements, including symbolism and film angles that were intended to be artistic, and turned out to be incredibly evocative and beautiful cinematography.<br /><br />Before proceeding with this review, I should mention the wonderful soundtrack by Ennio Morricone.  The music enhances each situation beautifully, and is one of the best soundtracks for a western of all time.  The signature song with the predominant drum and vocal is unforgettable, and perfectly formed to each scene in which it is used.<br /><br />The story takes place during the Civil War.  Clint Eastwood is essentially a con artist, turning in Eli Wallach for a reward, and then saving him by shooting the hangman's rope at just the right moment.  Clint and Eli have a falling out and the two separate.  Clint finds a new partner and is in the process of saving him when Eli runs into him.  Eli wants a little revenge on Clint, and is torturing him by walking him through the desert when they stumble on a wagon full of dead Confederate soldiers; except one is still alive.  The dying soldier tells Clint where $200,000 in gold is buried and then dies.  Suddenly Eli has to keep Clint alive.  The search for the gold is the true story to this movie, though it takes a significant portion of the movie to discover this plot.  The beginning of the movie to the start of the search for the gold is used to introduce each of the main characters and to establish their personality.<br /><br />This movie is full of highly detailed and complex scenes, each of which is a mini-story in its own right.  Perhaps the most memorable portions of the movie occur near the end.  In one scene, Confederate and Union soldiers are dying endlessly and pointlessly over a bridge that neither side can seem to capture.  The Union captain would love to see the bridge destroyed to stop the endless and pointless killing, but he is under orders to take the bridge intact.  Given the violence of this movie, it is ironic that this entire scene is about the futility of war.<br /><br />In a subsequent scene, Clint Eastwood finds a dying Confederate soldier and comforts him, covering him to keep him warm and sharing a cigarette.  Clint looks away to see Eli Wallach riding off on a horse, and the soldier dies.  The scene visually illustrates how fleeting life is.<br /><br />The final scene is classic western combined with Sergio Leone's masterful artistic touch.  The three principal characters meet in a graveyard where the gold is supposedly buried.  The confusion of Tuco (Eli Wallach) as he searches for the grave is illustrated visually.  The background music is eliminated in favor of natural outdoor noise for portions of this scene as the three principal characters participate in a dramatic three-way gunfight.<br /><br />Even with this scene, Sergio Leone was not quite done.  He had an afterward that reflects on how the movie began.  The ending is Sergio's impression of the classic American western, with a man riding off into the hills and theme music accompanying him, with soaring camera angles to illustrate the western ideal of independence and self-reliance and the American theme of individualism.<br /><br />You need not understand the artistic elements of this movie to be able to appreciate it.  You will sense the elements are there, if only subconsciously, and you will realize that this is a wonderful and great movie.  This movie is one you will want to see again and again, especially if you are a fan of westerns or epic movies.  Well worth buying and worthy of a 5 star rating.<br /><br />Note that several versions of this movie exist.  You should review the versions available and purchase the one that meets your needs best.</p></body></html>

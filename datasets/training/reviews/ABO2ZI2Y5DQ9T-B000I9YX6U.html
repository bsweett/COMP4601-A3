<meta name="summary" content="The Portrait of a Loneliest Man in the World"></head><body><p>People at indie film company Killer Films did it again.  After making impressive films like "Boys Don't Cry" and "Hedwig and Angry Inch" (or not so impressive "Office Killer"), they produced another film with a serious theme.  But don't worry; despite its subject matter, "One Hour Photo" is not as schocking as "Taxi Driver."  No strange haircut, no handguns in the sleeve, but just Sy, loneliest guy in the world.<p>Robim Willimas, after 3 years' absence, throws away any good-guy image he gathered in the 90s, and becomes Sy Parrish, one hour photo techinician working at a counter in a huge shopping center.  He works earnestly, takes his job seriously, and, most of all, is utterly lonely.  His only (day)dream is to be 'Uncle Sy' of his customer and picture perfect family Mr. and Mrs. Yorkin (read 'Your Kin'), whose life Sy hopelessly longs for.  But soon we learn that Sy can no longer handle his fantasy, and we are going to see his illusion run amok, making him stalk around the family.  And everything rushes to the disaster when Uncle Sy knows something he should not know about the family.<p>The film owns its enormous power to Robin Williams's creepy performance as Sy, who gradually loses the control of himself.  Though you may feel he looks (or sounds) like Patch Adams at first, you soon forget that sense, thanks to his strong acting.  By accepting the role of this lonely man, he once again after the good turn in "Insomnia" shows his will to extend his faculty as an actor, and he shows it well.  In fact, he has already shown another aspect of acting in his cameo role of terrorist in "The Secret Agent" (Joseph Conrad's film version), but never fully achieved the result.  But now he did it.<p>But "One Hour Photo" is helped by other factors; supporting actors Michael Vartan (Drew's teacher in "Never Been Kissed") and Connie Nielsen ("Gladiator") are both good, but the film's strength, in my opinion, comes from its production designs, music, and photography.  They all contribute to creating the cold, detached atomosphere of the film, and their effort is effectively shown in the manufactured feeling of the shopping place, with symmetrical shots of the unnnaturally clean and  white interiors.  That comes as no surprise when you know that production designer Tom Foden's previous work was Jennifer Lopez's thriller "The Cell" and photographer Jeff Cronenweth worked for "Fight Club" (by the way, his father Jordan Cronenweth may be much more famous for his "Blade Runner").  <p>"One Hour Photo" has some minor flaws -- dream sequence that looks out of tune, and flashback structure of narrative, for instance -- but the film is fascinating as a character study of Sy, this very lonely guy.</p></body></html>

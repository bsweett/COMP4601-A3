<meta name="summary" content="An interesting story"></head><body><p>Johnny Cash is practically a household name, and even if you aren't into fifties music you're bound to recognize some of his songs, like Ring of Fire and I Walk the Line. However, there's more to his story and this film does its best to tell it.<br /><br />Johnny's hardscrabble life in a relief community to his service in the Air Force and his failure as a salesman are all looked at. The film pulls no punches when it comes to his eventual drug abuse as he performed on the road and the way the pills he took eventually pulled apart his life. His love affair with fellow performer Carter is also highlighted and in fact is a recurring theme in the DVD.<br /><br />A good film but not my cup of tea. No doubt if you're more into music you'd like this much more.</p></body></html>

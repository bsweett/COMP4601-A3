<meta name="summary" content="Taken"></head><body><p>Taken is an action flick that's both efficient and absurd, and so it's often entertaining -- but only up to a point. The film stars Liam Neeson as a retired CIA agent who learns his daughter has been abducted in Paris; upon receiving a frantic phone call from her, he tracks her down -- and finds himself on the trail of a massive criminal enterprise. Taken is a sprightly piece of work, and Neeson is compelling in the lead role, but the film is weighted down by contrivances and leaps in logic.</p></body></html>

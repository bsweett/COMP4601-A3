He was the big name to get people into the theater, and he did a good job at his role, but Paz Vega is the true lead in this.  Paz plays a immigrant from mexico who decides to make a better life for her and her daughter by getting hired on as a housekeeper for an eccentric, upper class housewife who is clueless about daily life.  Adam Sandler plays the homeowner husband who just tries to hold life all together, and is just as grounded as Paz's character.  The movie follows the relationship of a housekeeper and the family over about a 6-12 month period, through the eyes of the housekeeper's daugther.  Despite a huge language barrier, bonds are made.  This is not really a comedy at all, but has it's humorous parts.  Good flick to just take in.  You'll either like it, or push it aside.  Worth a spin though, and give it a chance. Good rental.</p></body></html>

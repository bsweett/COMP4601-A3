Nick Cage is good, but his co-star steals the show. As with the United 93 film, the protagonists do not know what caused the day's tragic events, what was happening elsewhere, or whether their precarious situations would have any wider meaning than just to themselves and their loved ones. Oliver Stone turns in a restrained, non-conspiracy, non-paranoid, non-obscene, and oddly, a nearly non-violent work of art here. A lot of it is filmed in the dark, with only the heads and maybe one hand visible on each actor, and with dialogue hampered by their injuries and desperate situation. Yet it is quite powerful, and to me, a total success.</p></body></html>

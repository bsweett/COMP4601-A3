<meta name="summary" content="The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"></head><body><p>A rogue reporter is hired by a wealthy business man to search for his missing niece, who he believes was murdered by one of the family members living on their island estate some forty years ago. Blomkvist receives anonymous tips on the case by a beautiful young computer hacker with a shrouded past that has been hired to track him. Together, they will uncover a series of murders spanning over four decades as they unravel the family's dark secrets. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is the first feature film to be made based on Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, the top-selling novels out of Sweden. Niels Arden Oplev's thrilling adaptation combines the shock and suspense of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS with the mystery and intrigue found in THE WICKER MAN. Noomi Rapace plays the street smart Lisbeth Salander, who is repeatedly brutalized by each of the men in her life. Despite Rapace's cold demeanor, she puts forth an electrifying performance as the strong and resourceful researcher with a vendetta against abusive men. She is joined by Michael Nyqvist, whose subtle but calculated maneuvers make him perfect for the role of Mikael Blomkvist. GIRL offers devastating displays of rape and violence that are never sanitized for public consumption. Larsson's contempt for these deplorable acts manifests through Lisbeth's character, who strikes back at her aggressors with a fiery vengeance. The novel is beautifully adapted for the screen, although Oplev is sure to ground the events in reality with his restrained shooting style. Only the ending feels rushed, where many of the unanswered questions are resolved in rapid succession. This tightly-wrought mystery is sure to entrance audiences as much as it shocks and disgusts, making THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO one of the best in 2009.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></body></html>

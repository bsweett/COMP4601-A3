<meta name="summary" content="In the end a very silly movie"></head><body><p>The movie is visually stunning with some good one-liners. However, there are some real groaners. The movie makes one think about the role of government and the abuse of power. These are good ideas to ponder. The theme of ideas gives to one of the worse groaners. It went something like "Behind this mask is an idea and ideas are bulletproof." The other bad line if you stop and think about it is "It is the government that should be afraid of the people." What does that really mean? Respect the people, maybe. A government that fears the people gives rise to dictatorships and genocide.<br /><br />The movie has some intelligence in the dialog and the plot, but it gives not even a hint toward the answers. The philosopy is inane. Chaos for chaos sake seems to be the message. There are some nice plot twists, but one really big one that does not seem plausible at all.<br /><br />The movie is visually stunning, the mask is really cool. I did watch all of it without falling asleep. so I'm giving 3 stars. I marginally recommending it.</p></body></html>

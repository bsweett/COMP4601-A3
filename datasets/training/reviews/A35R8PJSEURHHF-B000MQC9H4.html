<meta name="summary" content="Not a great movie, but not a bad movie experience."></head><body><p>The plot is kind of unbelievable.  In one night two strangers switch houses without knowing eachother at all!!  Cameron Diaz' acting was interesting, as if she just had begun her acting career.  Jude's two daughters in the movie were totaly freaky (" 'elo Amanda' ", and were they having some sort of orgy in that tent?  Kate played her part very well I thought.  The movie wasn't that great, it was predictable, with happy ending and all....but it gave me a few laughs (mostly at it's stupidity), but still, I laughed.  Why was Jack Black in this movie????Enjoy the mind numbing experience with your freinds so you can make fun of the movie together ;) enjoy.<br /><br />p.s. scrooda-lee-doo</p></body></html>

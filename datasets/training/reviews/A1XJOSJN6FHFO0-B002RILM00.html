<meta name="summary" content="Not Very Good!"></head><body><p>We had seen the original Wicker Man so we knew what the storyline was about, however this version left so much to be desired.  First, let me say, that I truly enjoy Nicolas Cage and think he is a wonderful actor, but he should have passed this movie up.  He did the best job he could do with what he was given, but the movie...well!  As you know he is searching for his ex-girlfriends daughter who turns out to be his own.<br /><br />Determined he insults everyone on this weird island and is totally clueless to what is about to happen to him. Which might I add waS totally gross. I was bored and I had some questions that I wanted him to find out the answers for....why did the men stay there (the few that they showed,) and why didn't they fight these woman?  Did they for sure kill any male children born?? The answers to these questions would have made the movie at least a little bit more interesting.  Anyway, I'll still enjoy Nicolas in other movies I'm sure, but this one needs to be put to sleep.</p></body></html>

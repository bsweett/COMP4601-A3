<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely disgraceful and that is putting it mildly"></head><body><p>The old cliched statement that many reviwers used for films they despised is "2 hours of my life I cannot get back," or something along those lines. Many get tongue tied and really find it hard to say how truly pathetic a film was, so the easy route comes to mind rather quickly. That line, or many like it, is beyond acceptable for this mess.<br /><br />What amazes me the most about film goers, is their unkeen assessment of what a quality remake is. What epic, suspenseful gothic cinema is about. Is this a gothic film? No it's excrement, and the wild and whacky trip in this endeavor was that I knew from jumpstreet how bad it was going to be. I mean honestly, really, truthfully work with me here: can you get any better than Gregory Peck and the classic that this was based on?<br /><br />The answer is a definitive no. The suspense is junvenile at best. This is a film about the anti-christ, make it TERRIFYING. Was it terrifying? No. This is a film about the number 666. That, in itself, should send shivers up our spines. Did it come across in the film in a way to demoralize our senses into the realm of the beast? No. Do not let anyone make you believe this film has any saving graces, as it doesn't. Save the rather stellar actors in the film (Mia Farrow, Pete Postlethwaite) (why someone as superbly talented as Pete Postlethwaite, who I met on the set of Amistad, and is REALLY that amazing, would ever take a role like the one of the priest, is beyond comprehension).<br /><br />Go outside and breath in the life that revolves around us, you'll find more excitement in suburbia, and much more evil lurks out your front door.<br /><br />Pathetic and John Moore is a joke.</p></body></html>

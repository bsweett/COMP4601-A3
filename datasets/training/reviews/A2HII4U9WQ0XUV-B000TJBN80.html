<meta name="summary" content="Rage, Rage!---against the Dying of the Fright"></head><body><p>Here's a joke in the grim years after the devastation of the Rage Virus was released from a London biological research lab, ripping through the population like a blood-engrimed scythe & devastating the UK---you ready?<br /><br />OK, here goes: two guys are chilling outside of the Safe Zone, right? And one guy looks over this brick wall they're standing next to, freaks out, and yells "Oh my God, it's one of the Infected---he's coming this way!"<br /><br />And the other guy, he doesn't say anything, but he gets these brand new running shoes out of his rucksack and starts putting them on, tying up the shoelaces, the works, right? And the other guy is looking at him like he's gone crazy, and he says "what the bleeding 'Ell are you doing? Those things have Rage---they run like they've got a howitzer mounted in their [EXPLETIVES]! You can't outrun those zombies!"<br /><br />And the other guy just smiles and takes off, saying: "I don't have to outrun the zombies. I just have to outrun you."<br /><br />I made that joke up about 15 minutes in to watching "28 Weeks Later", the utterly uninspired sequel to one of the most nightmarish flicks I have ever seen, Danny Boyle's "28 Days Later".<br /><br />Now it's true that director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo had some mighty big directorial Wellingtons to fill: Boyle is a demented visionary and an absolute guerrilla warrior with his directing. Boyle's "28 Days Later" could have been a dippy little coda or sideshow to the 2002 onslaught of zombie flicks.<br /><br />But Boyle brought a silver ewer brimming with gory cinematic deviltry and---of all things!---dignity, to his End of the World flick. The result was brooding, elegant, gory, nasty, & insanely scary, a throbbing mainline right to the jugular of post-9/11's deepest, darkest fears.<br /><br />The sequel has the same trappings: the Sprinting Dead, zombies who do wind sprints to get you, tear your guts out, and then try out for the Iron Man triathlon afterwards. It has the Military, with their nifty gas masks & black battle armor & Happy Thoughts amped through the City of London, where evacuees have finally been allowed to return, 28 months later, after the American military has cleared the City of the Rage virus.<br /><br />You've also got the trademark Big Red Clotted Gory Puke Sequences (tm), where the jetting spew is of the extra-chunky Vegetable Soup variety. And there is a sweet, razor-blade instant of pure shrill terror during a sequence of rampant pre-quarantine madness at an English cottage which lopes along after the film's intro credits (though Boyle directed it, surprise!).<br /><br />Bottom-line, "28 Weeks Later" is like a bunch of grad students messing around with lab rats. Dump the Brits back in London; have a few grunts play peeping Tom with the starlight scope; wait for, as they say in Jurassic Park, "life to find a way." Life does, the Military uber-FUBARS it, & before you can say "would you like a side-order of red puke with your order, Sir?" London is, yet again, crawling with the wild-eyed infected, doing their yark-yarking thing all over again. Ugh.<br /><br />It's watchable, but only just. Amazingly, the sequel manages to take all that awesome fear, tension, and terror and totally jettison it out the airlock.<br /><br />But the concept still has promise, which is why I hope Boyle takes a final cut at this thing. However you want to frame it, Boyle's monsters, running zombies are utterly terrifying. The regular Romero-style lumbering dead are bad enough: given enough time & ample exhaustion on your part, they'll get you. But the sprinting dead---these zombies that run after you---that's just too much.<br /><br />If you don't agree, if you're not feeling it right now, then take a second and just think about the prospect. I just walked through my empty office this evening, out to the foyer, and into the can. I was in there about 2 minutes. I walked back out & the elevator slid open, and two guys---two mechanics, techs for the ventilation system---jogged out, totally spooked me flat-out bugshxt.<br /><br />I gotta admit, man, it kinda unnerved me. If those dudes had been infected?---OK, you're with me.<br /><br />Cool. Let's move on.<br /><br />That's what works about the whole 28 days later thing, what worked about the original, what even worked about Zach Tyler's terminally unsettling reworking of "Dawn of the Dead": these undead, hungry, hateful, baleful, gibbering things running at you with murder in their eyes and a-growling in the belly, before you can prepare. That's it, isn't it? You're not ready.<br /><br />The Running Zombie doesn't give a man a decent getting-ready time. It's like the [NAUGHTY WORD] in hide-n-seek years ago who would pretend to be counting to 100 and then go "38, 37, 36,---3, 2, 1 HERE I COME!" and everyone would panic. With a [EXPLETIVE] like that on board, those hide & seeks would become bloodbaths.<br /><br />So I guess what it all boils down to is this: quarantine this flick. Numero 2 doesn't move, it doesn't groove, it doesn't boogy, it doesn't scare me, & I can't dance to it.<br /><br />And pray for a follow-up that shows us something *really* scary.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

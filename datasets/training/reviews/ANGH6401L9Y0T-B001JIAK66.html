<meta name="summary" content="A Most Unique Horror Movie"></head><body><p>It's VERY unusual for me to give a horror movie five stars. But then this is a very unusual movie.<br /><br />Probably most of you know that Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackson) appears in the Dracula story as the one who knows most about vampires, and is dedicated to fighting them. This is the same character, in a way, but almost nothing else about this is the same.<br /><br />This Van Helsing, a very attractive and capable young-looking man, is actually some 400 years old. He's also working for a secret order of priests who send him out to kill Dracula (Richard Roxburgh). Along the way, he encounters a variety of nasty creatures, including Frankenstein's monster, a werewolf, Jekyl/Hyde and three Brides of Dracula, who are of course also vampires. Then there is their numerous offspring . . .<br /><br />Igor, originally Dr. Frankenstein's assistant, is working for Count Dracula by this time, since when Dracula loaned Dr. F an abandoned castle in which to reproduce his original work, the count was paying Igor's salary.<br /><br />Two more characters are critical to the story. I can tell you very little about Prince Velcan Valericus without spoiling several surprises, but Princess Anna Valericus is a beautiful, strong, fearless young woman who becomes Van Helsing's ally -- or he becomes hers. The Valericus family has tried to kill Dracula for hundreds of years, so far without success, and with major losses. In fact, the family will be lost entirely if Prince Velcan and Princess Anna do not survive.<br /><br />This is a major high action movie, with incredible special effects, that kept reminding me of the recent Zorro movies: there's a good bit of humor mixed in with all the blood and gore. And there is plenty of blood and gore, but somehow it didn't bother me so much as in most horror movies. I think it has something to do with the entire thing being in the realm of the supernatural, and therefore not nearly as frightening as psychotic murderers and the like that might be real.<br /><br />Unless you really can't handle horror stories at all, I think you will appreciate this movie. Van Helsing is just the right sort of hero, and even wears a hat rather like Indiana Jones.</p></body></html>

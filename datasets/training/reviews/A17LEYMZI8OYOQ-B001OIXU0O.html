<meta name="summary" content="Meryl Sings.  Pierce Tries. Fun Movie!"></head><body><p>Adapted from the hit Broadway play,  MAMMA MIA! is a captivating movie musical that makes you want to sing right along with the Benny Andersson/Bjorn Ulvaeus music and lyrics, based on the songs of Abba.<br /><br />In fact, one of the special features on the DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment is a Sing-Along with on-screen lyrics for 22 musical numbers.<br /><br />Meryl Streep stars as the independently-minded owner of a broken down hotel on a remote island in Greece.  Her about-to-be wed daughter (Amanda Seyfried) does not know the identity of her father, since Mom was being romanced by three guys around the time she was conceived, so the young lady invites all three fellows to her wedding, signing Meryl's name to the invitation.  None of them have any idea that they might be the bride's father.<br /><br />When Meryl sees the three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard) she just wants them to go away, but Amanda is not about to let that happen in this very fun, joyous musical comedy.<br /><br />Beautifully photographed under the direction of Phyllida Lloyd, MAMMA MIA! has some terrific musical numbers, performed by Streep, Seyfried and Julie Walters and Christine Baranski, who play Meryl's lifelong girl friends.  Ms. Baranski is particularly delightful.<br /><br />The men are not really singers, but they try hard and, truthfully, none of their songs require a strong voice.<br /><br />Director Lloyd supplies audio commentary and there is also a deleted musical number.<br /><br />?

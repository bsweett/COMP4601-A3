I felt that the film had a carefully unfolding so that the viewer was never certain of anything except the moral character of the nurse played by Naomi Watts. Now this is a nice plot devise to have one character on whom the viewer can trust to make ethical decisions and thus it allows you to suspend judgment about all the other characters and try to sort out the puzzle pieces one by one as they are revealed.  Violence is not implied in the film, it is usually shown in full gore. Likewise the plot is not always obvious and the film pulls a couple of surprises on you. The film depicts the Russian underground crime families living in London, a group hardened by the Soviet Union realities and the hardships they endured in Russia. The acting is superb and I was glad to see that Vincent Cassel was included in the top billing with Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts since he had a very difficult role to play which he delivers with great power. Mortensen does a super job in this film for he plays a driver for a Russian mob family who gradually is involved in more violence and is allowed into the inner sanctum by Kyril, the mixed-up son of the Russian godfather.  The nude steam bath fight scene is as terrible as anything I have seen in a film in a long time but it was highly realistic and amazingly filmed, though I have to admit I looked away a couple of times because it was intense. Armin Mueller-Stahl is the actor who plays the elderly Russian godfather of the underworld family. He seems like a grandfather but his dark side is gradually revealed and Mueller-Stahl plays it wonderfully for he remains understated from start to finish.  The plot is carefully filmed so that the viewer is shown details, clues, and character flaws one at a time until a picture of what is actually going on begins to reveal it. The ending is not sentimental at all and whereas it resolves in the minds of the viewer what happens in the future, it is not necessarily a happy future for all. I would recommend this to folks who can deal with a complex plot and a good deal of violence.</p></body></html>

Well, you're certainly not ready if you (or your kids) havent seen the first three Indiana Jones movies in the series. And this collection will do the trick perfectly.<br /><br />Okay...okay. I'm like 99% sure that it isn't absolutely necessary to see the first three movies in the series in order to fully enjoy the May 2008 release of Crystal Skull. But it will certain give you some history prior to jumping in to a 4th in a series, and it certainly won't be time wasted as they are excellent films.<br /><br />Raiders of the Lost Ark was stunning for its time (1981). No surprise with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg at the helm. Raiders holds up as one of the best action movies to date. Indiana Jones searches for and tries to protect a powerful relic from getting into the wrong hands. Viewers get thoroughly entertained with a fast moving, suspenseful and thrilling ride.<br /><br />In Temple of Doom (1984) Indy inadvertantly finds himself thrust into village overrun by an evil cult that commit human sacrifice and child slavery. Ironically, while the themes in Temple are much darker than its predessor, Spielberg actually 'dumbed it down' a bit (with some over the top slapstick and other silliness) in order to keep the film attractive to wider audiences and also to attain the first ever PG-13 rating (instead of an R).<br /><br />The Last Crusade (1989) brings in the great Sean Connery as Indy's dad, and together they fullfil a lifelong dream (more the Dad's dream than Indy's) of finding The Holy Grail. Strangely, Last Crusade got hit with a PG-13, but it was much lighter than Temple of Doom, and it went back to a more Lost Ark kind of action film.<br /><br />Overall, it was fun breaking out this collection (that I actually purchased here at Amazon 2004) and re-watching the movies with my kids. We're now all really psyched for 2008's Crystal Skull.<br /><br />For what it's worth, there is another collection coming out in May 2008 called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ONE">Indiana Jones - The Adventure Collection</a>. But from what I hear the only difference is in the bonus stuff. The item on this page already has a whole disk of bonus stuff...and the item on this page is available now.</p></body></html>

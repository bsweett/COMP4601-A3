Sure there's mind games but the movie is still not your usual bank robber wish hostages movie. It's smartly made by director Spike Lee and you never really know where it will go. Plus the performances are just top notch. Clive Owen finally gets a film since Closer where he gets to show how good of an actor he really is.<br /><br />  While of course Denzel is awesome as always as the dective trying to figure out what Owen really wants out of the bank robbery. While Jodie Foster gives a different sort of performance that we're used to from her. Christopher Plummer's "also really good" character owns the bank and hires her to make sure he gets something back that's inside the bank. She knows it must be something either valuable or something he just wants knew one to find out about. So she's really good as women that people go to get things done and she's also always makes it clear that she's nobodys fool.<br /><br />  While William Dafoe (Spiderman) is also in good form as a cop who's ready to take command of the situation if Washington messes up. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Four Brothers, Serenity) plays Washington's partner and the two work together well. Ejiofor has proven this year and last last that he's no doubt ready to be a big star. He shows that here too by sharing the screen with Denzel with ease. With the cast so good it helps that the script is so clever, interesting and unpredictable. This film is really a must see!</p></body></html>

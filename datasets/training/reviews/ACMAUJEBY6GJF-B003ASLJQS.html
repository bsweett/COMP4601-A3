<meta name="summary" content="Well done, but ONE BIG flaw is a little disturbing..."></head><body><p>Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are really that great in this movie, and no surprise there. Two of the best actors in the world today.<br /><br />But :<br /><br />It doesn't take you long to reveal the plot, does it? In the beginning of the movie we hear two boys call 991, "Your name, son?" the police ask - "He wants to know her name" the boy tells "someone" - hmmm...<br /><br />Wouldn't cops in the USA check out the anymonous call a little closer when they start their investigation. In the end (!) this call reveals it all, there is no grown man the police should be after. A major weakness to the story, and I realize I am not the only one to notice this, of course - or am I picky here?<br /><br />Anyway :<br /><br />Overall this movie is very, very well done - great camera-work, acting - and that behind a very tense and gripping story.</p></body></html>

Basically this takes the concept of Star Trek (ST) and ports it over to Galaxy Quest, a cheesy version of ST on a lower budget, where after the show has been cancelled and years later the crew find themselves earning a mediocre living at conventions and fan clubs and at the same time falling apart as a group because their leader won't take the conventions seriously plus they are having some relationship issues. Suddenly things change when an alien race hijacks the actors, thinking they are really heroes who have engaged and won great battles based on historical documents (intercepted television transmissions of their television show) and ask the actors to save them from an evil galactic villain. It turns out to be much more enjoyable than what a comedy like this usually ought to be and just steals your heart throughout even when it is being corny. If you haven't seen it, then watch it. Galaxy Quest could be one of the funniest family orientated films of all time. If only most comedies where this good.</p></body></html>

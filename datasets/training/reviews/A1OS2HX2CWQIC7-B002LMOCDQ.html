I don't mean to denigrate the stage musical from which this drivel was adapted; I've no doubt that it's not my cup of tea, and infinitely better than this aggravating slop. Here's what the viewer has to look forward to in this cinematic abomination:<br /><br />  * Plot holes that you could sail a yacht through<br />  * Unsightly women of varying ages making oversexed, obnoxious fools of themselves<br />  * Otherwise respectable popular screen actors performing moronic roles because their careers have nowhere else to go<br />  * A bunch of horrid, vulgar Americans, as usual<br />  * Singing that could strip old varnish from hardwood<br />  * Amanda Seyfried's wild-eyed, lunatic grin, which may as well have been as prosthetically induced as Nicholson's was two decades ago<br />  * Britrash, being too British and silly besides<br />  * Stellan Skarsg?rd's pale Swedish ass<br />  * Greeks, presented in their native environment as mobile background props<br /><br />Suburban anglophone housewives rejoice: your time has come, and this is surely the filmic avatar of your collective stupidity and tastelessness. Savor it while you can, for in retrospect, no sane civilization will hesitate to destroy every existing copy of this godforsaken disaster.</p></body></html>

Between Gods And Men, The Clash Begins..."></head><body><p>The much-antivipated remake of "Clash Of The Titans" roared into theaters in 2-D and 3-D, and it more than lived up to my expectations. The story from the first movie has been expanded thoroughly, and given a few twists that would make Zeus proud. Sam Worthington ("Terminator: Salvation") was perfectly cast as Perseus, as was Gemma Atterton as Io, Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades (interestingly, this movie marks the first time Neeson and Fiennes have been on screen together since Steven Spielberg's epic drama "Schindler's List"). Everyone was st to a perfect T in this film. The music is nothing less than epic. The 3-D effects are AWESOME. I've only a few minor quibbles: for one thing, I noticed that several scenes in the trailer (including one where Andromeda says to Perseus, "This isn't your fight" and he replies, "Someone has to take a stand") were cut from the movie. Secondly, I was disappointed that Medusa didn't speak in this versio (though the additonal screaming was perfect). Thirdly, I would have liked a flashback, showing Medusa before Athena transformed her into the creature we see in the temple (she was still beautiful until she screamed; I had no problem with her still being beautiful, though). Fourthly, and lastly, the film could have been about 30-60 minutes longer, with some more character development.</p></body></html>

That clip left with the impression that this was a fantasy film largely oriented to a youthful audience.  I saw it on the IFC Channel's schedule and made a point to watch it since I knew it was nominated for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.<br /><br />I was immediately impressed with the movie when I understood that it focussed on Spain in the aftermath of its' Civil War.  I have been a student of that conflict over the years and it helped me appreciate the film.  I was very much aware of the extreme passions that emerged during that war.  As the evil persona of the Captain unfolded, I found it to be quite credible.  My next impression was, What happened to the fantasy film I thought I was going to see?  Well, it also emerged but while it was an intregal part of the film, it was far more understated that I had thought it would be.  That was OK by me (I was particularly concerned that this movie might be a cartoon).<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" is a movie that becomes increasingly tense and that, to me, is the key to its' success.  I was engrossed in the movie throughout and I liked the mixture of reality and fantasy.  The mixture of the two led all the way up to the conclusion of the movie and left each of us the option of interpreting its' ending as we chose to.</p></body></html>

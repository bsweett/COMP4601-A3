<meta name="summary" content="Croud-pleasing Remake Of Leatherface and company"></head><body><p>The theatre which I went to on Halloween Night at about 11pm was 100% completely packed with people of all kinds, some as young as 8 or 9, others in their upper 70's. From the get go of the film when the young woman gets into the car and blows her brain's out, I could tell that everyone was have fun, getting rowdy and even screaming now and then. This remake of Tobe Hooper's classic "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" does what any sequel should do, which is follow the script from the first (Because the first film was most likely very successful or there would be no need for a re-make), Make everything happen that the first one did not deliver TECHNOLOGICALLY (I think everyone would agree that it was pretty cool to watch it in a much better screen definition & lastly to not change the ending ..... Ooooops! yes The remake's ending completely differs from Hoopers Classic (which was 220% better!) so overall all the movie serves the clasic well other than the ending,.....<br /><br />One of the main things other than the change of the ending the ending which I did not like was that they got Jessica Beil to play the lead role (which I must say that I was looking forward to seeing her croak at the end so you can only imagine the utter dissapointment HAHA!) AND that they changed the qualitys othe charactors from the 70's version a bit too much (such as the wheelchaired guy is not in the remake!) I thought that they should have included the crazy man from the original with the shaving knife that kept cutting himself for fun. I also thought that whole entire town in on the killings idea was stupid mostly just because I think it draws away the whole "True Story" statement.<br /><br />What I thought was absolutly brilliant from this film is that they added a villian in this one who was absolutly wand unmistakenly evil - the fake sheriff, he was in my opinion the true villian of the remake instead of Leatherface.<br /><br />Overall I dont think a remake can get much better btu If they would have changed just a few thing especially the ending than the movie could have been REALLY good, but hey I'm not dissapointed and like the reat of the audience that was there watching that night on Halloween, I enjoyed it just like they did!<br /><br />Grade: B</p></body></html>

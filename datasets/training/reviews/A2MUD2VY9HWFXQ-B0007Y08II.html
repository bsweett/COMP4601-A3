<meta name="summary" content="The funniest film I have EVER seen!!!!"></head><body><p>Once in a very great while, a movie comes along that is SO innovative, so original, so funny, and so creatively memorable that it stays with you long after the credits have rolled.<br /><br />I saw that movie last night, and it's called "Team America: World Police"!!<br /><br />Comedy hasn't seen much of these movies lately, but "Team America" certainly makes up for the gap in what I would say was definitely the most gut-busting, hilarious film spoof ever made for adults.<br /><br />This film is so priceless that I wouldn't dare include any spoilers, but here is a quick summary of events.<br /><br />Team America is a group of international crime fighters who always manage to get their man, and in the process; leave a path of total carnage and destruction in their path. When their next assignment calls for a little "espionage", they recruit "Gary", (a Broadway actor with demons of his own) to go undercover for them to fight the terrorists holding the weapons of mass destruction!!!<br /><br />Along the way, we learn all about loyalty, love, teamwork & betrayal: PUPPET STYLE!!<br /><br />This film was definitely made for adults, with plenty of action, profanity, gore, and hard core sex throughout the film. All done tastefully (yeah right!) of course. ;-)<br /><br />It also boasts one of the most fantastic and satirical scripts I have ever seen on film.<br />Matt Stone and Trey Parker take absolutely no prisoners as they tear into everything from the action, musical, horror, comedy, & adult film genres. There is also plenty of political humor in the film.<br /><br />Now for the puppets! These marionettes are so life-like it is stunning! The facial expressions are so detailed, yet in many scenes, the puppeteers actually spoof themselves by staying true to original puppeteer style. The walk and move like old fashioned puppets on a string, but the technology of them as a whole (especially there faces and costumes) is top of the line.<br /><br />This is a full blown action film. It is filmed just the way any big budget Hollywood epic is filmed (think Day After Tomorrow, or Independence day ), with the real difference being that this movie is actually GOOD!<br /><br />All the sets in "Team America" are meticulously crafted, and are splendid eye candy for the audience. The explosions and pyrotechnics are top-notch, and much better to watch in this movie than in the crappy action films that Hollywood regularly churns out by the dozen each year.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about "Team America: World Police" !  This is a 10 star film if there ever was one. I had to pause the movie 3 times while I was watching it because I was literally crying with tears of laughter. I will say that this film is completely adult oriented, and parents will need to choose carefully if allowing their children to watch.<br /><br />If you collect DVD's, this is a movie that MUST go into your collection. I never saw the R rated theater version, but the unrated and uncensored version is the way to go if renting or purchasing, because many, many scenes had to be thrown out for the MPAA to give "Team America" its R rating. On the uncut version, we get to see this film in all its glory.<br /><br />I will watch this movie repeatedly, and can not wait to see it again. As the theme song so eloquently states:<br />"America... F**K YEAH"!!!<br /><br />HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!<br /><br />GOD BLESS YOU TREY AND MATT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="interesting film"></head><body><p>All I can really say (without giving any real spoilers) is that I liked this movie, and it had a cool surprise ending. Well, maybe for people who like this kind of movie, the ending isn't that much of a surprise, there are a few hints here and there that things are not quite what they seem, but they're not so blatantly obvious as to make it east to guess how the movie might end, so it was fairly satisfying.<br /><br />The storyline and acting are rather solid, and the camerawork is well done. I don't really have any major complaints about this film. If you're a fan of the actors that star in this film, you shouldn't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

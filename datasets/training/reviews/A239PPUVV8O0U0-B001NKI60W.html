And when I bought the soundtrack for my mother for her birthday, I wondered how anybody in they're right mind could construct a musical around the songs of a pop group. So every year, there are movies that I set aside to see when they come out. This, originally, wasn't one of them. But after Indiana Jones, Get Smart, The Dark Knight, and The Mummy (which were all great don't get me wrong) but after all that action, maybe I needed something different. So I went to the theatre, with my mom and sister so as not to feel out of place amongst the miriade of women that would be in attendance, and didn't really expect much. I had the time of my life and this was absolutely one of the most wonderful experiences I ever had at the movies. The cast was amazing: I never saw Meryl Streep in a film before besides her cameo in the god awful Series of Unfortunate Events film adaptation and she astounded me with her voice (especially on her rendition of The Winner Takes It All). Pierce Brosnan was the biggest surprise to me (cause I never imagined a former James Bond being in a musical) but he too had a good singing voice (all of you people who says he can't just shut up and keep your opinions to yourselves. The ones who've criticized him probably have horrible voices themselves and just can't admit it). Her face and voice was familiar but I just couldn't place where I'd seen Christine Baranski before and then I remembered her supporting roles in Addams Family Values and The Grinch. And I couldn't believe that Amanda Seyfried played the dumb girl in Mean Girls so that too was a surprise. All in all it was a movie that made me feel good when I walked out of the theatre (aside from The Dark Knight, something that hardly happens) and the first real musical I've seen (I count The Blues Brothers films but they really aren't a traditional musical when you compare it to this. And its a better musical than any of the trashy, stereotypical High School Musicals).</p></body></html>

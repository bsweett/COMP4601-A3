An ode to a dying genre, Unforgiven is a poetic justice to dispel many of the misconceptions that numerous Western movies have established. I can see the blind-as-a-bat boy who fills in the place for the audience members while the old-timer veterans of Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman show literally what the life in the West is truly like. This is a clear-cut difference between men and boys. I love the acting, the mood, the somber setting, and the unique story of Unforgiven. What makes Unforgiven so great is how realistic the movie feels while depending on the mystique of the legend out of William Munny, played adeptly by no one other than Clint Eastwood, while it becomes a monster in the final climax. There is a great sense of humor throughout the film. Moreover, Morgan Freeman once again proves that he makes a perfect supporting actor with Clint Eastwood. I am impressed with everything about Unforgiven, and it will stand out as one of the most enduring Westerns ever made. Clint Eastwood deservingly gets recognition for this picture and also for Million Dollar Baby. I've always knew that Clint Eastwood was a true filmmaker, and this one, he proved his mark. While nobody had paid attention to this man, Jaimz Woolvett gave a standout performance as the Schofield Kid. What he did deserves accolades. All in all, Unforgiven is a genuine Western film noir.<br /><br />8/11: Nearly the last true Western made, Unforgiven rights the wrongs that many Westerns in the past have committed, further mythologizing the Old West for something that it's really not. Unforgiven boasts of an all around cast including Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman. These three are the reason why you watch the film. It is as good as it gets. More important, Clint brings a resume with him when it comes to Western films, many of them quite bad, so it is obviously he set his heart on making the best Western as possible and leave his mark in the now dead genre. One underrated performance, never lauded by anyone, is by Jaimz Woolvett as the blind-as-a-bat Scholfield Kid. It's too bad he went empty that year. All in all, Unforgiven is a masterpiece and one of Clint's usual unforgettable trademarks.</p></body></html>

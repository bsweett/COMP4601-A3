The T-101 model terminator (Arnold Schwarzeneggar) comes from the future to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl), the future savior of the human race, from a more advanced model (Kristanna Loken) sent to destroy him.  This time, it happens simultaneously with the long-dreaded ascendance of Skynet and the revolt of the machines.<p>T3 lacks the freshness of T1 and the intelligence and human drama of T2, but it certainly delivers as a special-effects laden thrill ride.  It also benefits from some genuinely unexpected events toward the end of the film.  Very entertaining.</p></body></html>

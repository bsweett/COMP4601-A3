<meta name="summary" content="A brief comment"></head><body><p>This is overall a decent movie but is marred by some unfortunate flaws, mostly relating to plot plausibility and consistency. Well acted by the two main leads, Bullock and McMahon, it is nicely paced and has some beautiful cinematography, but it would have been so much better if not for several problems.<br /><br />I'm sure I'm not alone on many of these, but the problems I found were:<br /><br />1. Mother has daughter committed when it's obvious she's not responsible for the cuts on her child's face when she accidently ran thru the plate glass door. This just isn't explained and is contrary to the facts as presented in the movie.<br /><br />2. The scene with the priest where they try to explain her visions as a sort of spiritual uprootedness is just plain hokey. Movie thrillers aren't the best place for metaphysical and theological speculation.<br /><br />3. The menacing psychiatrist doesn't make much sense, nor does his prescribing Lithium on a first visit, a drug normally used for depression, not stress. The unsympathetic psychiatrist certainly adds to the overall stress factor in the movie but really isn't credible.<br /><br />4. The convoluted timeline with all of Bullock's flashbacks makes the movie a hard to follow.<br /><br />5. In the end, she still can't change the future despite knowing it, which has already been the subject of endless sci-fi stories and other movies. I would have tried to find a less predictable ending.<br /><br />6. The guy she meets at the lakeside seems to prefigure a future relationship with him, but when the flick ends suddenly there is no further hint of why that scene was included. This brief scene could have been edited out since it just seems to be a red herring.<br /><br />7. I agree with previous reviewer, baberufus, that Bullock's telling her husband to turn around right at the crest of the hill was just plain silly. She knows what's going to happen with the truck and should just have told him to get out of the car right away and off to the side of the road when the car stalled. But most importantly, she should have told him to just stay where he was in the first place and not turn around until the truck passed.<br /><br />Overall, though, a decent flick and thriller if you can manage to overlook a few gaffs, and the great Kate Nelligan has a good supporting role as Bullock's mother.</p></body></html>

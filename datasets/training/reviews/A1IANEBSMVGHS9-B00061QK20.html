I was speechless with the art direction and the photography of "Hero". It ranks as one of the most beautiful movies ever made. The way the colors that prevail on a scene are in sync with the scene's mood, is not subtle, but it is impeccable and tasteful. In addition to this, the way Tun Dun's music once more is integral to the story shows how deep of an artistic relationship the director, Yimou Zhang, and the composer developed.<br /><br />While I can see how some people may find some of the fighting scenes a bit unrealistic, that doesn't take away from its brilliance and how artistic they are. In this movie we're being exposed to a different culture, one where honor, tradition and denial of instant gratification are above all things: something for us as Western people to learn from.</p></body></html>

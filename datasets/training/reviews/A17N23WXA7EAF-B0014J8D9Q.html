<meta name="summary" content="Great as a film, not just a Western"></head><body><p>&quot;Unforgiven&quot; contains a gritty realism and psychological insight that is distinct in any film, not just in Westerns. In this sense, the film is a tremendous accomplishment for Clint Eastwood as an actor and a director. Eastwood plays a gun fighter whose career has largely subsided as the civilizing process has begun to displace the frontier mentality in the American West. Eastwood is hired by some prostitutes to settle a score with an abusive client. He and his party gun down the person but in the process they run afoul of the town's sheriff (masterfully played by Gene Hackman) who has legally sanctioned gun fighting of any sort. When Eastwood's partner is killed by the sheriff's posse, Eastwood returns to the town and single-handedly confronts them. The battle that ensues is somewhat unrealistic (Eastwood kills several men including the sheriff) but makes sense on a symbolic level. The untrammeled spirit of the frontier confronts its civilizing nemesis and wins even as it becomes an extinct phenomenon. The intense realism and Eastwood's subtle, understated performance are what make the film work. So much of the film is presented in a plain understated fashion, that by the time we get to the symbolic conclusion we still believe it is real.<p>After the gun battle, Eastwood pours himself a whiskey with his back to the door and his unloaded shotgun under his arm as the terrified survivors of the posse hide between buildings outside. When he is ready to leave, Eastwood shouts a warning that he will kill anyone he sees and if he is opposed, he will kill the individual and his wife. He leaves the bar, mounts his horse and rides off into the darkness in full view of the terrified posse. <p>Eastwood's departure is more than just a finale for the film. As he rides into the darkness he takes with him the individual will to settle disputes with violence. The defeated and humiliated posse survives with its mandate to expropriate the individual's recourse to violence. Eastwood may have won the last gunfight, but even he cannot prevent the elimination of private justice and the state's consolidation and ownership of violence.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Is Austin Losing His Mojo? Oh, Yeah, Baby!"></head><body><p>"Goldmember" earns a very generous rating of three stars from Yours Truly, a fan who couldn't get enough of the far superior first two Austin Powers films. After setting the box office on fire with 1999's "The Spy Who Shagged Me," Mike Myers returns in "Goldmember," which is the most confident and flashy of the three films. It also happens to be the weakest. The plot is simple: a flesh-eating Dutch agent of Dr. Evil named Goldmember has kidnapped Austin Powers's dad. So, Austin must travel back to 1975 to rescue him. While the film features impressive performances from Michael Caine as Austin's dad and Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra (an obvious nod to the Pam Grier/Tamara Dobson blaxploitation films of the 1970s), "Goldmember" has a worn-out, "been there, seen that" feel to it. Toilet and anatomy jokes abound, which are fine in moderation, but they wear out their welcome real fast. Plus the Goldmember character (played by Myers) isn't very interesting as a villan. But what does work is the string of cameos (none of which I will reveal), particulary during the first ten minutes. We also get some clever references of films from "The Silence of the Lambs" to "Yentyl." And while I was expecting to trash Beyonce in her silver screen debut, she actually gives her role a welcome dose of sass and spark as Austin's sidekick Foxxy. However, she's not really required to do much more than look fabulous, sport her abs, and recite one-liners from Blaxploitation films. I walked into the theatre with high expectations of "Goldmember," which were sadly not met due to the second-rate quality of the film's material. In my school of cinema, this film gets a C+.</p></body></html>

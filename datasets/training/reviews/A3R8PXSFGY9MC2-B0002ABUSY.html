<meta name="summary" content="Dawn of the Dead"></head><body><p>`Dawn of the Dead' is a pretty decent reworking of a classic Zombie film and whilst it has it's detractors I feel it manages to come up trumps.<br /><br />This follows a group of people who hole up in a shopping mall after a Zombie outbreak and shows how they fight off the Zombies and their own tensions.<br /><br />This has some decent zombie effects and boy can these guys move, much faster than I remember and more scary for a modern audience, I guess, than the shuffling creepy Zombies of old.  Ving Rhames is believable as a gruff cop and Mekhi Pfifer is good as a father who has to deliver his own baby under unusual circumstances.<br /><br />This film manages to be both creepy and action packed in equal measures and is a worthy addition to the Zombie genre.  Don't compare it to the original and enjoy it in it's own right and this should provide ample entertainment for an evening.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

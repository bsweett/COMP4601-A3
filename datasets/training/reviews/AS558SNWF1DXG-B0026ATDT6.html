<meta name="summary" content="Something's wrong underneath...."></head><body><p>After all the great reviews I'd read -- including a particularly persuasive rave in "The New Yorker" -- I was primed to see this horror-comedy about a pollution-bred monster running wild in a Korean sewer system.<br /><br />But despite its smooth look and admirable camerawork, "The Host" is surprisingly uneffective. Aside from the moster's brisk initial attack, the action isn't exciting and the comedy isn't especially funny. In fact, large sections of this film are just boring.<br /><br />I'll take an anti-hero any day of the week, but the family here is so hapless and sad they quickly become maddening.<br /><br />It's great to see a thriller with ambitions beyond the typical PG-13 slasher flicks, or the hard R-rated torture chamber endurance matches, but "The Host" has a long way to go before it's in a league with "Jaws" or "Alien" as some have suggested.<br /><br />Disappointing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A road trip taken by two middle-age college buddies proves to be oddly therapeutic"></head><body><p>Former college roommates Miles and Jack embark on a road trip getaway in advance of Jack's wedding.  What begins as a tour of California wineries and golf courses takes a fateful turn as the groom-to-be makes clear his intention to sample more than just prestigious vintages and pristine fairways.  It is a dearth of the more salacious pleasures (rather those of dusky pinots and well-manicured greens) that Jack anticipates with the coming of married life, as his quest for wanton female companionship becomes the focus of their trip.  This change of agenda proves to be unnerving to poor Miles: an intellectual oenophile, English teacher, and frustrated novelist still gun shy in wake of his recent divorce.  Nevertheless, these adventures prove illuminating for these two very different friends.  While Miles, at the urging of the gregarious Jack, attempts to be more outgoing, Jack ultimately seems to take to heart Mile's concern regarding his reckless behavior.</p></body></html>

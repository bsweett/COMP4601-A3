James McAvoy playing the doctor also did an outstanding job but is not receiving the attention he deserves but in the end this is a two man show that really just skims the surface of the characters as well as the times.  Only the two lead characters develop any depth and all of the other actors are little more than props.  Nevertheless the film is beautiful and a pleasure to watch.  In many ways this is a morality play that shows how the young doctor-- like most young men -- longs for excitement and desires to see exotic places and do exciting things, but pays for his naivete`.  We find him in Uganda caring for the poor, which he wanted to do, but he is very quickly overwhelmed by the sheer number of them, the long hours, and the lack of progress. Doing good seems to be a lot less fun than he expected and the isolation as well as the work pall. Through some very believeable happenstances he is suddenly thrust into luxury surrounding the military dictator Amin. Thus begins the doctor's transition from callow youth seeking fun and excitement into trusted confident, then into co-conspirator, and finally just another victim of the dictator's paranoia.  There are several lessons delivered by this film.  The first quite obviously is to be careful what you wish for because you just might get it.  But it also teaches you to be careful how you treat others because you may find that you need them later on.  The gratuitous insults hurled by the doctor at the British diplomats come back to haunt him in full measure.  Then we see Idi Amin who is both charming and paranoid because like Richard III when you seize power by force you can never relax or trust anyone.  So Amin sinks into paranoia and distrust and he begins to eliminate all suspected of disloyalty.  He trusts no one including the doctor and surrounds himself with thugs willing to kill and torture for him-- but this is the fate of all dictators from Tiberias to Stalin to Amin.  Eventually they live in fear and rule by fear.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film and the characters were quite believable.  Whitaker IS Amin -- it is hard to realize that he just acting.  However, as powerful as his performance was I thought Dicaprio's performance in the Departed was better.  Plus I thought Whitaker's role was more of a supporting role.  Nevertheless this is an outstanding film and McAvoy and Whitaker deserve all of the kudo's they are getting.</p></body></html>

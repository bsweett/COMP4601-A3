<meta name="summary" content="Heartwarming success story"></head><body><p>Jim Braddock is a man who is trying his best to support his loving wife and children during the Depression.  He has reasonable success as he works himself up the boxing ladder, but eventually injuries take their toll and he is unable to pay his bills and keep the electricity on in their small apartment.  Russell Crowe does an exemplary job of depicting the humble yet relentless fighter and Renee Zellweger is his faithful and supportive wife.  Their relationship is what holds the family together during the toughest times.  She would much rather her husband earn his living in a less dangerous arena than boxing, but she does not prevent him from following his dream.  This is a touching, absorbing, and thoroughly satisfying film.</p></body></html>

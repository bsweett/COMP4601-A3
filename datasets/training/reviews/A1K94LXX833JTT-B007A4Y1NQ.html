<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant, original, chilly humor"></head><body><p>It would be easy to analyze this film as a puppet show within a puppet show, as a puppeteer ultimately caught in his own strings, and so on, but none of that gets at what is most striking about it.  The film creates a world with its own logic, to which it stays true enough.  The characters act as we would expect them to, once we know who they really are.  What stands out in the film is the masterly, fresh comedy, from hilarious quirks to perfect deadpan send-ups of artistic and other high pretensions.  (And there's some excellent puppet work that the film doesn't invite us to fully appreciate.)  But all of that will be undermined for some by the emotional ambiguity of the film.<br /><br />It begins the way many quirky comedies do, with what appears to be a basically decent person with sensibilities normal enough that we can identify with them, surrounded by other characters who are more cartoonish and off-kilter.  The contrast and tension between the normal and strange heightens the comic effect.  We are drawn in a little, enough to sympathize, but by the end of the film no character has developed into anyone we really care much about, and to the extent we do still care, our sentiments are rewarded with what ought to be chilling results, though they're played more for their dark humor.  No one turns out to have the capacity for any but the most superficial human warmth and love, obsession and casual sex taking their place.  Arguably the adults in the film deserve their fates, or, in the case of Malkovich, deserve only limited sympathy.<br /><br />But what of the fate of the young girl at the end, whose psyche is already violated?  Well, either we can laugh it off and treat the film as a superficial comedy in which such things shouldn't be dwelt on, or we can identify with her as real and feel bad for her, in which frame of mind this becomes a more disturbing film all around than is generally acknowledged.<br /><br />This sour note isn't so much the fatal flaw of this film as it is the clearest indication of it.  The emotional balance of the film is unsettled.  At times we seem to be dealing with people like us, with whom we should identify; at other times we see them as lacking real souls.  This may be regarded as part of the conceit of the film, that the rules of this alternate universe include that humans aren't fully human, or are only ambiguously so (which, of course, can be seen in context of the puppet theme).  That makes the film consistent in its way, but it's an ambiguity that leaves us unable to fully respond to the characters and what happens to them.  Comedy mistreats its characters, but if we're induced to care about them at first, it's more than comedy when they're truly hurt, or when we no longer care if they're hurt.<br /><br />That will bother some people more than others, and, judging from the reviews, most people not at all.  If you like Fargo and Rushmore, you'll probably love this.  Just don't get too attached to the characters or anything else that seems genuine at first if you want to enjoy it as comedy.  And if you want to see it as tragic and disturbing, the overall comic approach may be more bothersome than helpful.</p></body></html>

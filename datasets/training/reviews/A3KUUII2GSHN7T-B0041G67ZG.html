<meta name="summary" content="Sean Penn, unfortunately,proves me right again."></head><body><p>This film was good. That's right, just good. The storyline is suspensful and manages to do just enough to suck you in, but I wondered aloud to my friends if they, or I, would even remember the plot after two months. I doubt any of us will.<br /><br />The reason for this is Sean Penn. I have always liked him, especially in roles like The Thin Red Line (which was perfect for his gloomy demeanor), and Mystic River, as well as his ability to direct (Indian Runner and The Pledge come to mind). But here, alongside a strikingly beautiful Nicole Kidman (who does a wonderful job in this film), he loses his audience as a Secret Service Agent.<br /><br />There are long lapses of time when Sean Penn does little more than manage to move a single facial muscle and speak above a monotone. Some would say this is classic Sean Penn being loosed and allowed to act the way he has admittedly craved, but I disagree. Wanting him to move past that classic depressed Sean Penn resonance, I found myself disappointed once more, because Sean fails to do so again.<br /><br />A good film but certainly not what the critics are calling it.</p></body></html>

Last year's pairing of him and Viggo Mortensen (A History of Violence) provided one the the most exciting film events of last year. Viggo is so relaxed and subdued that it's hard, at first, to understand his Oscar nomination, though there is a regular undercurrent of renewal and redemption he finds that is so terribly profound (and sad) at the end. This film, based on real persons in the Russian mafia in London, is scripted by the very clever Steve Knight, Oscar nominated for "Dirty, Pretty Things", but I thought this was better, though very similar. I won't say more about the plot, but the participation of the always wonderful Naomi Watts, and Armin Mueller-Stahl are perfect. I also liked Vincent Cassel a lot; should've been nominated for his very difficult role. Indeed, the casting all-around is letter-perfect. The DVD offers a few insightful extras, especially about the tattoo element, more important than you might think. I enjoyed "Eastern Promises" as an exciting film achievement. A huge feather in the hat of the very competent David Cronenberg. If Viggo's performance seems too subtle to compare against others that weren't nominated, let's not forget his auspicious debut in Sean Penn's "The Indian Runner", as well as LOTR and his other pairing with Cronenberg, and many others. The Academy often likes to cover their past mistakes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Closer" makes you relive every bad moment you've ever had"></head><body><p>in a relationship.  For most people, that's too much to take onscreen!  For me, it means that small moments of the film keep reappearing in my consciousness, unsettling me from time to time.  That return to the moment or moments caused me to give this sweeping character study by famed and beloved director Mike Nichols, 4 stars.<br /><br />"Closer" is a curious film, excellent in its execution, and yet, for those who go to films to be entertained, "Closer" will be a dismal failure. Look at it as a character study, a train wreck of every bad relationship you've ever had.  It is not at all entertaining; in fact, it is brutal and artificial in its conception, in its deception.  You are deceived into thinking it will eventually become a love story, but instead it is a story of emotional wounding.<br /><br />Four characters become entwined in relationships based on sex, which they perceive to be love.  The meeting of Dan (Jude Law), angular and sinewy, an obituary writer with a chilly outlook on life (and a lack of integrity that is so much on the surface, you wonder what it is the women see in him) and the luminous, voluptuous, Alice (Natalie Portman) is quite by accident in a London street.  She's running from a life in New York that wasn't turning out the way she planned, and it feels as though she will meet and take up with someone, anyone, on the street.  Dan is a good choice for her emptiness.  We see him next in Anna's (Julia Roberts) photography studio - now a semi-successful author who is posing for a book cover, and who has partnered with Alice for a couple of years, he is immediately arrested by Anna's behavior and looks and wants her desperately.  Alice arrives and Anna is taken with her looks and sexuality, photographing her in a beautiful shot that survives and lives to be a centerpiece in a future show of Anna's work.  Meeting Alice cements in Anna's mind that, as much as she is drawn to Dan, she does not want to be with him.<br /><br />As Anna rebuffs Dan, his smarmy response is to set her up for a meeting (unknown to her) with a wanton doctor that he meets online in a sex chat room.  The doctor, Larry (Clive Owens) is sexual in a primal, raw and needy way.  His encounter with Anna turns from the embarrassing to the sublime when he is able to cut through her reserve and anger with his amazing looks and rough charm.  Your initial reaction to Larry is that Anna is lucky to meet him.  His honesty, decency, and, despite his amazing looks and profession, his lack of polish are disarming.  The four have their first (and only) mutual encounter at Anna's photography show, and it is during this show that the filmgoer begins to become perplexed by the relationships.  Alice and Larry have an encounter that simmers in its desperation, Dan is undone at the outcome of his prank and it becomes apparent that Dan has never ceased pursuing Anna.  More surprises and misdeeds wait after Anna and Larry have been married, in an attempt at decency, only to have her withdraw in a baffling move, in favor of Dan.  The complex feelings of abandonment and anger; the raw emotion that opens when one half of a couple admits to cheating, is repeated in the encounters between Larry and Anna and Dan and Alice.<br /><br />Stunningly, the four are not finished with each other as the divorce proceeds and Larry encounters both Alice, who has returned to her career as a stripper, and then Anna in a scene that will leave you wondering what in the world could Anna's motivation be, and just what will ever make her happy.  There is no decency, no loyalty in the behavior of any of the characters, except for Alice, who retains her amazement and loyalty to her coupling with Dan, until she realizes just how self-absorbed he is and just how much of a game it all is to him, and finally, finally, breaks free; the only one of the three, you believe, that will ever be free of the deceit.<br /><br />It is easy to dislike and distrust Law, and eventually to cheer for his comeuppance.  Although I did not think his performance as strong as that of the others, the very nature of how much you DO dislike him, despite both ladies' love for him, is telling in how much he inhabited his character.  Roberts is credible as Anna, although her screen persona is far too warm to play the cold and confused photographer, who plays out her inner turmoil in her black and white portraits, which are stark, indeed.<br /><br />She is accurate in displaying her moods on her face, accomplished in her dialogue and there is no doubt about why both men would want her, but somehow, she is unable to pull the whole thing off.  Or perhaps she and Law just pale by comparison to the truly excellent performances given by Owen and Portman.<br /><br />Owen, who has been truly decent and sexy as Larry, is a revelation when he is spurned; his behavior varies widely from sorrow, longing and desperation to anger and coldly calculated emotional brutality.  This role, like much of what  Owen has played in the past (a fierce and rugged "King Arthur" in Fuqua's film of the same name, an intense and passionate turn as a doctor in Angela Jolie's "Beyond Borders," in a revelatory role in "Bent" as a Nazi prisoner who is also a prisoner of his own homosexuality, and, best of all, his enigmatic and cold cynic "Croupier" role) is a tribute to his ability to immerse himself in the character, and then draw the audience in with him.  It is high time that the powers that be in Hollywood discovered him not only for his amazing screen presence and beauty, but his skill as an actor.  After "Closer", hopefully they will recognize leading man material and he will find a film that will propel him into the upper echelons of today's leading men, where he belongs.  He's had a long career of mostly "B" grade films, where his performance is the saving grace of the entire movie.<br /><br />As good as Owen is, he's eclipsed by the breathtaking turn of Natalie Portman as the character who disguises herself as "Alice".  She's tantalizingly sexual and a cipher between the wanton and the vulnerable in meeting Dan, meeting Larry, and in the strip club.  In private scenes with Dan, as part of a couple, she's engaging and almost childish in her love for him.  I've long thought of Portman as the young woman of the beautiful face, and thought she was amazing in "Garden State", but here she truly steps out of the "goody good" roles she's been taking in the past, and gives us a taste of what Natalie Portman, on the brink of adulthood, can be.  She alternately portrays innocence and the knowingness of a woman who knows she inspires lust at first glance.  Her scenes as a stripper are a revelation of beauty and body, and she's "large and in charge" of the encounter with Larry; that's when you know that, despite the hurt, despite her willingness to run from port to port in a storm, she's ultimately a survivor.  Portman was surprisingly cast, and Nichols' instincts and ability to direct such an amazing performance leave her, too, on the brink of a career explosion, if she chooses roles correctly.<br /><br />Unlike many of the critics, I did feel the chemistry between the characters; complete and utter longing and abandonment, not love.  By film's end, you are convinced that all of them are soulless.  I did not, however, feel or engage in the worth of any one character; was not rooting for them, was not drawn in by them, at least until the closing scene in New York, in which a very different Portman takes a walk as "Alice", now liberated from the need to hide or costume her appearance.  In this final walk, I was touched by how happy I was that she'd escaped the madness, and how much I wanted her to be happy.<br /><br />Nichols was fortunate to escape with an "R" rating for Closer as presented.  Should he have been given an "NC-17" he would have been forced to edit some of Owens's language and some of the scenes, notably from the strip club.  Although this film is not for children or teenagers, it is filmed in an honest and frank fashion, much of what Nichols is known for.  The frank sexuality is necessary to understand and to frame the characters' motivation.  The DVD version of this film, at least the only one that has been released at this time, uses Superbit technology, so the filming is beautifully portrayed, but none of the extras that would normally come with a DVD are present (and perhaps this was due to the rush to release it before the Academy Awards).  The film is shown in English and French, but there are no outtakes, no interviews with the players to understand how they got motivated into their characters (and this would have been fascinating, especially in the case of Portman), no Nichols interview, nothing to redeem the price of the DVD.<br /><br />One more amazing thing about the film, however, is the theme song "The Blower's Daughter" (the video is contained on the DVD) by Irish troubadour Damien Rice.  It is powerful and haunting, perhaps the best movie theme of the past several years.<br /><br />And thus, my recommendation is to rent, not buy, and only if you are looking for insight into filmmaking, or transformation of a play to a film, not if you would like to be entertained.</p></body></html>

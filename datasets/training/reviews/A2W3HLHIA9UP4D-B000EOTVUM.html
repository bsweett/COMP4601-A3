Nevertheless, I also I had my doubts too. When any film is being compared to the level of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre,  I have my doubts, because no horror movie, before or since, has quite been able to reach that level. And no, this movie does not reach that threshold of horror, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good movie. The story of the film, though rather quite simple, is good, the acting is surprisingly good as well. The film does have a "documentary-style" feeling to it. There are a lot of close-ups and shaky hand-held camera shots, and the actors seem to be really talking and communicating with each other, rather than just acting out lines of written dialog. What I didn't like as the length of time (almost an hour) in the film before anything really started happening. I would be willing to let this go if there was any real plot development during that first hour, but nothing really important or valuable to the overall story happens during this time. But once the movie kicks in, its quite good. There's an excellent torture scene that I enjoyed, (that sounds a bit sick, doesn't it? lol), as well as a couple of excellent chase scenes. Another thing that jumped out at me, was how the movie fools you into thinking certain characters are gonna survive, only to kill them off. I'm not going to give away the ending, but to me, the character that I would have least likely thought of being the sole survivor, actually does survive! This doesn't happen that often in these type of films. But while I'm on the subject of survivors, I did think that the body count was way lower than it should have been. And though, it was implied that the killer had murdered many others, you only get to see a handful of kills. Perhaps another character or two should have been added in some way, or maybe a quick flashback to a previous murder would have worked. I guess I'm just sick, but some more killing would have been nice!! Now as far as  this DVD goes, the special features are ok. There's a director's commentary thats pretty good as well as 50 minute "Making of Wolf Creek", which is pretty decent. There's also 1 deleted scene, which I hope was included as a joke or something, cause it's really short and stupid. But all in all, this film is definitely worth buying if you're a horror fan. And though I wouldn't consider this movie a modern day classic, nor put it anywhere near the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it does have a certain look and feel to it that makes it good little horror movie.</p></body></html>

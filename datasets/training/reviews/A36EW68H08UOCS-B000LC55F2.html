(If you have not, you really should see "Memento" which is told in five minute chunks - arranged in reverse order.)  In "The Prestige" he takes a first-rate cast and a lurid magic-noir story and ends with a result that had my family talking for an hour afterward.  Do I recommend it? Yes.  Is it perfect? No.  There are plot twists aplenty. Not all of them are as surprising as the film wants them to be.  (Did you guess the "secret" of "The Sixth Sense"? Me neither.  At least one of the major "secrets" of this film lumbers along in front of your eyes for half the film, and when it is revealed I didn't get that sense of being deliciously tricked that I got from Sixth Sense.) The final "secret" required a little more suspension of disbelief than I was willing to give as a character-drive period drama ends with a science fiction device as unbelievable as time-travel.  It was a good plot device - for a different story.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman joins actors who have worked with Mr. Nolan before: Michael Caine and Christian Bale.  Hugh plays Angier while Bale plays Borden - rivals who escalate their professional rivalry into a deadly game of one-upmanship. Michael Caine's character builds the elaborate magical devices used onstage.  He serves as both supporting character and a one-man Greek Chorus of sorts as he introduces elements of the story. The non-linear narrative covers three distinct time periods.  In the earliest time period Angier and Borden are assistants to a magician who has great illusory skills, but not much showmanship.  In this period Piper Perabo is Mrs. Angier - the lovely female assistant to the older plodding magician.  Something happens to Piper that ratchets up the rivalry between the younger magicians to matching deadly obsessions.  In the "middle" timeline Angier leaves Victorian London to visit the mysterious Nikola Tesla and his electric laboratory in the snow-capped mountains of Colorado Springs.  Tesla is played by David Bowie in a surprisingly effective performance. Andy Sirkis steps out of the role of Gollum to finally arrive on-screen with his face shown.  The Colorado sequences are effective with the snow-covered setting and Bowie's performance - portraying Tesla as half mad-scientist, half philosophical sage.  Angier commissions Tesla to build the "ultimate" magic trick. In the latest storyline we are shown that Angier is killed during one of his performances by Borden in the most extreme expression of the rivalry between the two malevolent magicians.  But is Angier really dead?  If he is, was it Borden who really killed him?<br /><br />Rebecca Hall plays Borden's wife, Sarah, and Scarlett Johansson plays Olivia, who is first hired to be the pretty distraction assistant to Angier.  Angier sends her to spy on Borden and to this moment, I'm not certain who her loyalties were chiefly with, although I suspect both by the end.  I've read other reviews that say she is wasted or underused in this role, but a lesser actress would have had a more difficult time making us believe that Olivia could be torn between the two men - or as involved in the underhanded dealings that occur.<br /><br />Secret journals add to the twists and turns.  It took a good hour of talking after the film for all the members of my family (myself included) to have pieced together all the clues and surprises that had been unleashed - particularly in the final ten minutes.<br /><br />I have not read Christopher Priest's original novel, so I don't know how much the single quibble I have with the screenplay (the science fiction part) has to do with the original novel compared to the adaptation by Christopher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan.  If I may offer my opinion - could not the story have been resolved without the use of a plot device that is simply scientifically impossible?</p></body></html>

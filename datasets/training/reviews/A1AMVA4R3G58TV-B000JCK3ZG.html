<meta name="summary" content="Okay Sci-Fi"></head><body><p>X-Men The Last Stand is a good Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi movie. The special effects are pretty interesting.<br /><br />And I can see how Ian McKellen can go around saying that this is a movie he personally relates to.<br /><br />Even though I really like Sci-Fi,  and I have seen the previous X-Men movies,  I am really not an expert on X-Men.<br /><br />Basically, the Mutants are fighting for their right to remain Mutants. A "cure" has been discovered and they don't want<br /><br />to be forced to take the Cure.<br /><br />But the only character I could sympathize with was Angel, played by Ben Foster. This was really the only character in the<br /><br />movie that had any emotional depth.<br /><br />Even in a sci-fi movie, I like to have some sense of who the characters are.<br /><br />The scenes where the Mutants are fighting are pretty good, and with good special effects.<br /><br />And Of course, there is always Hugh Jackman - who is so good looking whatever role he is playing.</p></body></html>

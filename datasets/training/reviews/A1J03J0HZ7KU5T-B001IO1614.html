<meta name="summary" content="Bondian Deja Vu"></head><body><p>The James Bond series reaches another crossroads with "Die Another Day" (2002). Despite some new wrinkles to the rather tired 007 formula, the reliance on computer-generated effects makes the film look like a cartoon. Pierce Brosnan remains a solid Bond, with a memorable assist from Halle Berry as Jinx. However, the actors and director Lee Tamahori are shortchanged by a weak script. "Die Another Day" offers some nice homages to previous Bond films, but cannot escape the overall sense of deja vu. Brosnan's 007 deserved a better finale and his recent criticisms about the franchise were justified.</p></body></html>

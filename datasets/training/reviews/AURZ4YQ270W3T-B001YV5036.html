<meta name="summary" content="Immensely likeable film about a decent guy"></head><body><p>Unlike many A-list directors, Ron Howard's style isn't immediately apparent when you watch his films. There's no trademark shot, no distinctive visual that grabs you and says, "hey, this is a Ron Howard movie" (unlike, say, Martin Scorsese).<br /><br />Howard's films are usually workmanlike, with a subdued, whole-grain-goodness style about them (indeed, his worst film, "How The Grinch Stole Christmas," is also his showiest). That makes Howard the perfect director for "Cinderella Man," a film about a guy who succeeds in life mainly because of his honesty and determination.<br /><br />The guy in question is James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe), whose promising boxing career in the 1920's was cut short by injuries and bad luck, but was revived in the early 1930's by luck and sheer determination.<br /><br />Braddock is one of those people for whom work is its own reward, whether it's in the ring or on the docks of Hoboken; indeed, it's his job as a dockworker that teaches him to use his left hand properly, which made him a far stronger boxer (previously he only fought with his right).<br /><br />Braddock is a decent man who just wants to provide for his family and live with dignity (after his career is revived, and he lands a world championship bout against Max Baer, a reporter asks Braddock why he fights, and he responds, "milk"). There's nothing showy or overstated about Braddock the man, or Braddock the fighter, but his inner strength and experience with the crushing adversity of the Great Depression make him a most formidable opponent (as Baer, one of the most feared fighters in boxing history, found out).<br /><br />Braddock's comeback happens largely due to the efforts of his manager, Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), whose cocky, ebullient personality complements Braddock's natural strength perfectly. Gould is suffering the effects of the Depression himself (his fancy Manhattan apartment is empty, the contents having been sold to make ends meet), and in Braddock he sees something to believe in.<br /><br />The relationship between Braddock and Gould is the heart of the film, and both Crowe and Giamatti shine. Zellweger has some nice scenes as Braddock's wife, who fears that her husband will be killed in the ring, but curiously, her role is almost secondary to Gould's.<br /><br />The final fight sequence in the film, which pits Braddock against Baer, succeeds on an emotional level, but the editing made the action difficult to follow at times. Still, if Howard's direction doesn't "stretch the envelope" of fight sequences, it serves the story (the standard-bearer in this regard is still "Raging Bull," in my humble opinion).<br /><br />But is this movie really about pushing the envelope? Not really, and in this sense, the understated direction fits the story perfectly. This material would have been all wrong in the hands of a Spielberg or Scorsese.<br /><br />The film leaves the viewer satisfied but not ebullient, and maybe that accounts for its rather disappointing showing at the box office (one wonders why it wasn't released in the holiday season instead of the summer).<br /><br />But "Cinderella Man" is a solid, exceptionally likeable film nonetheless.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A truly unique ghost story!"></head><body><p>I love atmospheric ghost stories, and some of my favorites are The Changeling, The Haunting, Burnt Offerings etc. The Others is one such atmospheric horror movie with enough plot twists to keep you guessing almost right till the end. Yes, the movie tends to be a tad too long and plodding in the first half, but if you're patient, and just try to pay close attention to all the details, the rewards more than make up for the slow start. Nicole Kidman shines in her role as the overprotective & obsessive mother, and the two kids who play her children do justice to their roles as well ,coming off as creepy and innocent at the same time. I won't delve into the actual plot as it will only spoil one's viewing experience but I will definitely recommend this movie for those atmospheric horror movie buffs who love unexpected twists, and an intelligent ghost story!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Anthem to 70's Rock"></head><body><p>"Almost Famous" is a sort of riff on Director Cameron Crowe's early years reporting for Rolling Stone.  You don't have to be a rock enthusiast to enjoy its sweetness.  Set in the early 1970's, when rock was drenched in a sort of easy-going, sun dried, alcohol and drug-fueled haze, and teenagers across America worshipped at the altar of Led Zeppelin with a fervor thought reserved by Star Trek fans, it tells the story of William Miller, a high-schooler trying to become a Rock N' Roll Journalist.  Preternaturally mature (by age 11, he's in the same class as 13 year olds, and they still hate him), and sheltered at home by a lovingly domineering mother (superb Frances Mcdormand), William falls in love with Rock yet is less determined to become a rocker himself than follow in the footsteps of  the legendary Lester Bangs, the self-appointed Dean of Rock Criticism.  Getting his first break writing for Bangs's "Creem" magazine, Miller gets his big break when he's tagged by Rolling Stone to cover the burgeoning band "Stillwater" on its "Almost Famous '73" tour.  Bangs remains ever present mentoring Miller through the process of covering the fast-rising band, an endeavor that requires Miller to remain aloof and objective, but not so distant that the band's suspicious members won't shun him as "the enemy".  Despite her better instincts, and on Miller's oath that he won't miss high-school graduation, Miller's mother allows the boy to go on tour with Stillwater, a fictional band loosely hinting such 70's confabs as Credence, the Allman Brothers and the Eagles.  A steady stream of sex with the band's dedicated groupies (called "Band-aids", young girls with fake names who insist that they're there for the music) and various feuds between band members helps to occupy Stillwater's principals, and frustrate Miller's attempts to get the band to say anything coherent on tape.  Too sweet (or uncool) to be insistent, Miller follows the band across America, watching self-imposed deadlines come and go.  Adding to Miller's stress is his own burgeoning love for Band-Aid in-chief, "Penny Lane" (Kate Hudson), whose adoration for Russel Hammond (Crudup), Stillwater Lead Guitar, blinds her to how the band uses its groupies.<p>"Almost" is a great movie, one of those understated gems from director Cameron Crowe. Though an anthem to 70's rock fandom, the film excels on its characters -  Stillwater's lead vocalist's pompous platitudes on the significance of Rock, Crudup's acid-induced meanderings at a party he crashes in Topeka, Phillip-Seymour Hoffman as the sage Bangs and especially Macdormand.  Like a band, the film excels not only on solo acts but also on how the characters impact each other - the look on the Topeka partygoers or (in one of the flick's running gags) the look on the faces of hotel workers who have to take messages from Miller's mother, or the lecture that Hammond receives from Mrs. Miller herself.  (I'm not sure if Mcdormand's character is supposed to be a reference to the song, Mother", off of Pink Floyd's "The Wall".)  Above all, the script drips with tasty lines, bizarrely unforgettable zen koans (like the one about groupies who eat steak but don't use birth control) and a fair amount of period rock references.  When Crudup's Russel Hammond proclaims himself a "golden god", you might miss the Zeppelin reference, but you won't miss the imagery, one of a lost age that outdid ancient Greece in resembling the cover of "Houses of the Holy".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Second Half of a Masterpiece"></head><body><p>Way back in October I went to see Volume 1, mainly because some of my friends were planning on seeing it.  My attitude was, to say the least, greatly changed before the release of Volume 2, which easily stands as the most highly anticipated movie release of my life, so much so that I eventually became concerned that it wouldn't live up to my expectations..  Fortunately, it did stand up, and proved to be the perfect companion to the already fabulous first half, and taken as a whole it stands as one of the finest achievements in film that I've seen..<p>As most everyone knows, Kill Bill was always intended to be one film, and was only split in half late into production.  This makes it particularly surprising and remarkable that the two Volumes are so extremely different.  All told, there is only about 5-6 minutes of action in the second volume.  Dialogue is, once again, King, easily compensating for the relative lack of it in Volume 1.  Furthermore, it moves in a completely different direction both visually and musically.  Gone are the urban and Japanese settings of the first film, replaced largely by rural settings in Texas and Mexico. The cinematography and editing are starker, and far less flamboyant.(though still far from conventional, for the most part) The more eclectic soundtrack of Volume 1 is replaced by one more fitting of the desert settings, relying heavily on Spaghetti Western style music along with some spanish sounding stuff and a bit of country.  All this means that those of you who loved Vol. 1 need to get the proper mindset coming in, as this is a completely different experience..<p>With the new emphasis on character and personality I suppose I ought to go into my thoughts on the acting in the film. Personally, I found all the main characters to be quite interesting and/or likable, and the acting was uniformly excellent.  Thurman brings out some genuine sympathy for the Bride, and adds a whole lot more emotional depth to the character than would seem possible after the first film.  Budd defies expectations as he is now a broken down and drunken slob, who is revealed to still have a propensity for sadistic violence. (Madsen does an excellent job of displaying 2 substantially different faces while still remaining the same character)  Elle proves to be more or less EVIL, and perhaps more of a caricature than a character, but I don't mind.  It's also cool how Tarantino leaves you wondering about why she is the way she is until the very end when it just sorta comes together through the final detail we learn about her.(or maybe that's just me) Of course, the real standout is David Carradine as Bill.  Bill defies expectations as well, as he was built up as a sort of mythic villain in the first Volume, and is now revealed, early on, to be far more human, and far more normal than that. He proves to be very likable and fairly sympathetic as well, and Tarantino doesn't cheat us in trying to do this by either excusing or ignoring what he's done. He's particularly excellent at the very end, as is Thurman.<p>Despite the emphasis on dialogue, what action they have is still first rate.  Each of the fights is very cool, with the fight with Elle being of particular note.  It provides a great contrast to the largely balletic and elegant motions of the House of Blue Leaves fight, as it is remarkably uncontrolled, harsh and brutal. The ending of it is quite hilarious as well, but I won't give it away. The fight with Pei Mei is quite cool as well, and even more stylized and over the top than the HoBL.(albeit in a different way.) In fact, the whole chapter with him is quite excellent, particularly the training montage and the campy silhouettes.  There's also an excellent suspense scene in Budd's part.  I won't give away any specifics, but it really manages to give a sense of claustrophobia and tension despite the fact that you know there is no way the Bride can die at that point.<p>Many have complained that this is too slowly paced and has too many extraneous scenes. I suppose I see where they're coming from, but I don't think anything should've been removed.  The scene with Budd and his boss isn't absolutely needed, but I think it works because it juxtaposes 2 very different sides of Budd when matched with the following scene of him and the Bride.  The most criticized scene, involving an old friend of Bill's named Esteban, is still useful in my mind, mainly because it provides a buffer between the fight with Elle and the confrontation with Bill.  However, another fight would've been nice, and probably would've made the pacing better. (Though I didn't think it was too slow anyway)  A fight with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would've been great, and would've proved to be the ultimate homage. (as a friend of mine pointed out) Though Kareem's getting pretty old and maybe he hasn't kept up with his marital arts. Still, one can dream...  <p>The highlight of the film is the final chapter, which is, obviously, the confrontation with Bill.  As many have said, it is primarily verbal, emotional and mental rather than physical.  This will disappoint many, who were hoping for another huge fight.  As great as another fight would've been I think this works better, particularly when you consider the 2 volumes as one film.(which is the only way to do it)  This allows the film to have both an absolutely first-rate action climax and a fantastic emotional climax, something which is exceedingly rare. It's also a pretty gutsy move to have an emotional, sorrowful ending after all the brutality preceding it, but they pull it off, and it turns out to be the best possible ending. <p>10/10  A+  5 stars  etc.</p></body></html>

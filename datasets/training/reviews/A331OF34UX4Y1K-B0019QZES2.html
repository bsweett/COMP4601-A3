It's so bad, so by the books, so uninspired, that it did not seem the same Gaylord Focker we watched in MEET THE PARENTS. This alone was responsible for a great part of the disappointment that this sequel is.<br /><br />Hoffmann gets out of this mess untouched. This guy is a master actor, he can play anything, he has timing for anything. De Niro is, to my pleasant surprise, better than in the first movie.<br /><br />The trouble is: the script is not even close to the hilarious quality of the first movie.</p></body></html>

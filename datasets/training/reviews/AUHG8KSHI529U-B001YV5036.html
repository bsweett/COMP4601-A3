<meta name="summary" content="Except for making Baer into a real bad guy, this is terrific movie with good lessons on family and perseverance"></head><body><p>This is an inspiring movie based upon the life of James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe).  He was a boxer who found some success, but lost it all as the Great Depression took prosperity away from so many.  The movie shows us his love with Mae (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) amid the riches, and then quick cuts us to their poverty and struggles in even feeding their kids.  Braddock tries to keep fighting, but is injured and even loses his license to fight.  He has a had time even getting day labor work on the docks.<br /><br />Eventually, like a fairy tale, he gets a shot at a comeback and does better than anyone had hoped and eventually earns a title shot with Max Baer (Craig Bierko).  In all fairness, it must be noted that the movie treats Max Baer unfairly.  He was not the monster the movie makes him out to be.  Yes, one fighter died in the ring and another a few weeks later, but Baer was troubled by it rather than proud.  The movie does show Baer and Braddock touching gloves after the fight, but in real life, they hugged.  The DVD has an extra with footage from the real fight and shows this.  The drama of the movie just wanted a fairy tale bad guy to make Braddock's accomplishment even more wonderful.  It is just that Baer's son is still alive as are people who cared about him and it is something that has to be acknowledged.<br /><br />Probably the key point in the film is a press conference when Braddock is asked why he is doing better in his comeback than he had before.  He explains that he had been fighting hurt, had gotten some bad breaks, but that he also knew why he was fighting now.  The reporter asks him what that is.  Braddock says, "Milk".  Perfect and perfectly set up by what Ron Howard and the actors show us of the struggles during the hard years.  Anyone who has struggled in life and faced real despair can relate to this story in a deep way.<br /><br />I recommend it very much.  There is some pretty exciting fight footage that can be too much for young children, but otherwise it is a fine movie and great for kids the right age to see for its good values and lessons about family and perseverance.<br /><br />There are fine extras on the disk about the casting and making of the movie as well as more information about Braddock and Gould.  The principles in this movie are terrific, especially Crowe, Zellweger, and the fabulous Paul Giamatti as Braddock's manager and friend, Joe Gould.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Fun Movie!"></head><body><p>Ang Lee's Hulk movie was hated amongst critics as this film is, and they are true opposites!<br /><br />"Hulk" took itself seriously.<br /><br />"Fantastic Four" didn't take itself seriously enough!<br /><br />"Hulk" was heavy handed with it's psychological analysis.<br /><br />"Fantastic Four" was glib with it's psychological analysis.<br /><br />"Hulk" progressed slowly.<br /><br />"Fantastic Four" rushes from scene to scene, at times feeling unglued.<br /><br />But when all is said and done, these are COMIC BOOK movies! They're not supposed to sweep the oscars. Fantastic Four is  scattered and uneven, but it succeeds at being FUN... much how those Christopher Reeve superman movies were (not counting #3).<br /><br />And it's funny without being silly... like "Batman and Robin."<br /><br />It's fun without the heavy handed "darkness" of Tim Burton's "Batman", or "Daredevil."<br /><br />It's not as well made or as well scripted as the two "X-Men" or "Spider-man" movies  ... still... It's FUN. Long live Marvel!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of "The Shroud of Torrington."</p></body></html>

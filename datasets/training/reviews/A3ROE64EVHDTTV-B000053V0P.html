Good strong imagery.<br />*Good film style and good production design.<br />*Storyline is engaging, filled with lots of drama and comedy.<br />*Very accurate to White House politics and military strategem.<br />*Lots of good characters.<br />*Lots of memorable lines.<br />*Okay music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*A little cheesy and cliched.<br /><br />This is one of the most entertaining blockbusters ever made.  It has loads of excitement, action, and special effects.  And it even has room for comedy, drama, and interesting ideas.  It's not a particuarly deep movie, but it's a lot of fun.</p></body></html>

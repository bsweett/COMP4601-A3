<meta name="summary" content="Great idea, fair execution"></head><body><p>The idea of transporting Alien and Predator to an unsuspecting town somewhere in the U.S. and having them battle it out, seemingly destroying the whole down in the process, was a great idea, but unfortunately the execution here is only fair. I didn't hate the movie like many of the Alien and Predator fans here who gave it 1-star reviews; I thought the action and overall concept were good, but I do agree the movie had more than its share of problems.<br /><br />For one thing, I agree with many of the reviews here that the lighting was way too dark and it was difficult to see many if not most of the scenes. Add to that that many of the scenes take place at night, in dense forest, in darkened buildings after a power failure (how convenient), or even underground in the city's sewer system, there are plenty of opportunities to avoid wasting any photons. They even show people using night goggles in several scenes; well, they probably needed them just to get around the sets.<br /><br />There are too many characters to be developed in any meaningful way, but no doubt that was just to increase the body count, since all but a handful of them get killed off. And the action scenes were shot in that choppy way that often makes it hard to even follow the action, which I don't mind usually, but this movie had more of it than the original AVP.<br /><br />Still, there's plenty of action and gore if that's what you want, but as one disappointed reviewer here commented, you can't see the gore because it's too dark. But  be advised that this is the most violent Alien and Predator movie yet so it's not for everyone. There are scenes of aliens killing young children, teenage girls, and helpless pregnant mothers. They have to keep escalating the violence with each movie, so if it's interplanetary or intergalactic gore you want, you'll find plenty of it here. It's just not easy to see it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ron Howard plays it safe...but you'll love this movie!"></head><body><p>Note: In this Ron Howard movie, brother Clint Howard's traditional cameo is as a bald boxing referee!<br /><br />I'm not a Ron Howard fan, but there's little to criticize in his latest effort, "Cinderella Man". It was a thoroughly enjoyable, well-made movie. Of course, Howard was able to attract perhaps three of the best of the best to star in the film, and Americans, fresh on the heels of TV's "The Contender" and Eastwood's masterpiece, "Million Dollar Baby", seem eager to see "the sport of kings" on the screen. Boxing of this era "pulls no punches"...the visceral and brutal activities in the ring aren't softened or play-acted for effect.<br /><br />Howard is honest with his camera work; his scenes in the ring move in tense, balletic style. There's a tendency, when chronicling the life of a great boxer, to drag the film down with too many fight scenes ("Ali" comes to mind!), but Howard humanizes his hero by making the boxing a sidebar to the struggle for life by a young couple and their children in Depression-era Jersey.<br /><br />Howard uses thematic clues from the film, "Seabiscuit". His theme is how the hero worship of a down and out sports figure during a comeback could heighten the mood of the downtrodden during the scary era of the 30's. Whereas Gary Ross of Seabiscuit fame could portray the relative ease of the economic crash on the western states, Howard pitches right in to how the crisis devastate the once-mighty in the Manhattan area.<br /><br />He and writer Akiva Gold give us surprising little of early Braddock success. Usually Howard plays it pretty predictably in his films, but this time, although he shows an early Braddock win and possible star quality, he skips over one of Braddock's big successes in the 20's, his bout against light heavyweight champ Tommy Loughran in 1929, which he lost in a controversial 15 round decision. (Likewise, Howard avoids Braddock's big fight with Joe Louis, where he lost the championship in later years. The loss of the championship really does not fit the comeback theme of his film.) Instead, Howard plunges us from ringside success right into the crash that threw all of America on its heels -- and Braddock and his family move from pleasant suburbia to the squalor of just eking out a meager existence where obtaining even enough food to feed your kids is a hardship.<br /><br />Moving quickly into this tone, Howard makes us believe in his characters. Having worked with Crowe in "A Beautiful Mind", Howard wisely lets the actor call his own shots. The confident, once proud Braddock is reduced to begging for work on the docks, fighting to keep his family alive and together. Both the scenes in which Braddock has to seek Public Assistance and the one in which he goes to a Manhattan boxing club to beg for money to feed his family show Crowe at his best -- a man among men brought low by circumstance. And, during his comeback, Crowe stays true to that picture. Braddock's character truly makes you believe that Crowe had learned that his passion for boxing was nothing more than a way to keep what really matters, his family, together. Crowe plays Braddock equally well as a boxer and a man; he's equally at home in tender scenes with each of his three children, as a devoted and sexy husband to Zellweger's Mae, (perhaps Crowe's own new life with wife and child influenced how exceedingly well he could play this role!) The best of Crowe comes out, however,  as a friend and commodity to sassy trainer/promoter Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti).<br /><br />Renee Zellweger gets to roll out some of what made her so successful as Roxie in Chicago. Her odd beauty fits with the costumes and hairstyles of the day. She's torn between supporting her husband, a world-class fighter who spiraled into oblivion and then rose to the surface again. She's terrified that he won't come home from one of his brutal bouts...but then, with three children during the Depression, she's a realist about their need for money. There's a little spark about her moxie when you see how far Gould will go to avoid her haranguing him about keeping Braddock safe.<br /><br />Although all three performances of the leads were award worthy, Giamatti once again gets my vote as the sometimes droll, always entertaining Gould. As Gould, Giamatti is a scene stealer and the perfect foil for Braddock, who would otherwise be too serious. Perhaps Giamatti's finest moments are when he takes on Baer in a bout of words only while the champ fights Braddock in the ring. Crowe plays strong when surrounded by strong support, and Howard truly cast Giamatti well in this film. Perhaps Giamatti ("Sideways") won't be bypassed by Oscar THIS year.<br /><br />There are other supporting characters who truly improve the quality of the film, but no one more than Max Baer, who appears late in the film. The engaging Craig Bierko (Broadway's "The Music Man") plays Max Baer over the top as a total lout. His ability to bring this version of Baer to life should reawaken interest in the short-lived reign of the Heavyweight Champ who also happens to be the father of one of the Beverly Hillbillies. He is savage in the ring and loves his night life and swagger. You believe he's foolish enough to goad Braddock by his interest in Mae. Bierko is highly believable and larger than life.<br /><br />Two cinematic "moments" are worth mentioning - Howard puts his theme of people determining what REALLY matters to them in perspective as he films Crowe's comeback against Corn Griffin. While preparing for, and in the ring against Griffin, we see Braddock flashing back to the fight for survival and the looks on his kids' faces. This is jet fuel for the man who finally learned to use his left when he had to work on the docks with a broken right hand. Howard employs the technique of flashback well, if predictably. And Zellweger gets her chance to be reflective, as well. In an eerie scene, as Crowe goes up against Baer and Mae has to try to deal with her feelings, he flashes back to her memories of widow Sara, wife of Braddock's friend Mike, as she buried her husband Mike, and then rushed through the cemetery, scarcely believing he is gone. These two flashback sequences, although a bit contrived by Howard, clearly set the tone for the film's message.<br /><br />Howard has nothing to apologize for here. He's made an outstanding movie, skirting the shadows for what Americans love best, honor and honesty. Although this feel-good film is definitely the best of the year so far, I'd give the performances a "5" and the overall quality of the film a "4". Howard played this one a little safe -- none of Braddock's warts, none of the texture of what a man is willing to do when his family is starving, little of the greed and dishonesty of the sport, is displayed on the screen. The filming is safe and straightforward, and yes, entertaining. But Howard may have missed his chance to make a more complex piece about a man caught in desperate situation; and he may have shied away from making Giamatti's Gould the anti-hero that all promoters seem to be. Still, and all, a great effort for all concerned, right down to the music.<br /><br />By all means, go see it in theaters, it will leave you smiling.</p></body></html>

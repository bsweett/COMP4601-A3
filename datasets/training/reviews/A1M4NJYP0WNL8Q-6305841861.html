And Dead By Dawn is the worst kind of badness -- a totally awful sequel to a film that was a parody of the totally awful films I grew up with.  It is a film where one can actually see the actors suddenly realize that they are acting too well and, with a jerk, dumb everything down even more.  At some point one has to wonder whether Sam Raimi is making fun of the whole genre, just scream films, or me.  The latter, I suspect.  And everyone else who goes through contortions explaining why really bad films are actually 'cool.'<br /><br />Standard hokey plot - one after another a group of people are drawn to the cabin of an archeologist working on a translation of the Necronomicon.  Lovecraft turns over in his grave.  A section is read and draws the attention of an ancient evil.  Soon people are being possessed, the dead rise, and parts mix with axes and chainsaws in an ever-growing chaotic pile.<br /><br />Every effect is studiously arranged to ring a bit false.  While there are spectaular makeup jobs, the effect is intentionally comic.  But the comedy, the sight gags, the windows that are perpetually broken and then boarded up again, and the tiny cabin with it's infinity of rooms really don't hold the film together, any more than they would a burlesque show.  This is a film designed for intermittent attention.  Any 10 minutes tells you exactly the same thing as every other 10 minutes.<br /><br />As a result I kept staring at the cabin's clocks with the 'dead by dawn' refrain repeating in my mind, hoping against hope for a glimpse of sunrise.  As much popularity as this film enjoys, it never made it over my own bar, and I'm not really all that much of a snob.  But each viewer should decide for him or herself.  It is entertainment, after all, with all the comfort of the horrible made less so by our ability to laugh at it.</p></body></html>

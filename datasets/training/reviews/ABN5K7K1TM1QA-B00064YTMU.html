I mean, what is with this sub-genre?  Consider these engaging hit man movies from the 90s:<br /><br />2 Days in the Valley (1996)  Danny Aiello as an over the hill hit man turned pizza baker.<br /><br />Grosse Pointe Blank (1997)  John Cusack as a cute whimsical amoral murder artist with Dan Aykroyd giving some comedic support in an over-the-top portrayal of a rival hit man always making with the jokes.<br /><br />The Professional (1994) Jean Reno stars as Leon, a cold-blooded professional hit man sans people skills who doesn't know how to read (but has a heart).<br /><br />La Femme Nikita (1990) Anne Parillaud plays a bitter, drug-dependent, unsocialized child of the streets who becomes a highly skilled hit woman.<br /><br />Point of No Return (1993) starring Bridget Fonda, is a kind of Americanized La Femme Nikita.<br /><br />And there are more I'm sure that I've missed.<br /><br />I think this sub-genre came about when film makers got desperate to do something besides "on the lam" movies and mafia glorifications.  I also think this sub-genre has something in common with "the whore with the heart of gold" flick.  It would appear that these days an actress doesn't really feel fulfilled and accomplished unless she has played a prostitute.  Can it be that actors in general will feel unfulfilled until they have played a hit man/woman?<br /><br />Surprisingly enough Collateral is also a buddy movie of sorts, or at least Tom Cruise's Vincent thinks he is making a friend, in as much as he is capable of making a friend.  Jamie Foxx doesn't think so since he clearly divines that Vincent is one very sick psychopath.<br /><br />But what makes this movie stand out, aside from Foxx and Cruise doing such a great job, is how stylish is the development, how worldly wise the dialogue, and how crisp the direction.  The fact that Jamie Foxx could have and should have gotten away from Cruise half a dozen times is really the only flaw in the movie.<br /><br />Another good film directed by Michael Mann is The Insider (1999) starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.</p></body></html>

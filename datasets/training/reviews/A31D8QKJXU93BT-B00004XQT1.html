<meta name="summary" content="Better Than the Book"></head><body><p>Usually it's the other way around. To say that the movie is better than the book isn't saying much. Although its gruesome murders drew feminist fire and made headlines and best-seller lists, "American Psycho" isn't literature and isn't read today. But this film version is assured DVD shelf life because it largely replaces the gore with the satire that might have improved the book. It may have surprised author Bret Easton Ellis more than audiences that the movie emerged from all the controversy as a chilling, amusing examination of urban alienation. It's not the bloodbath that fans of Quentin Tarentino or George Romero might have expected.<br /><br />The movie does pay its thriller dues (and paid dearly for its NC-17 rating.) But the filmmakers have more than thrills in mind. They tip their hand with a credit sequence that draws us into a high rise world of sleek bodies and correct addresses. We see drops of blood splashing onto a white surface, then streams of blood, then - - - but wait, it's not blood at all but red syrup and rasberries garnishing plates in a Manhattan restaurant. They're being served to jaded young Wall Streeters who like to trade business cards, wisecracks and insider gossip.<br /><br />Suddenly, "American Psycho" is off and running in another direction, away from our expectations.<br /><br />Stay with it, even after I tell you that our young financier takes an axe to a colleague, has a fridge full of heads and a closet full of bodies, tapes his sexual threesomes, and that at one point he chases a blonde through his apartment building brandishing a chainsaw, naked and covered in blood. Repellent? Yes, but this is a serious movie with serious themes and a serious actor, Christian Bale, wielding the weapons. Reese Witherspoon and Willem Dafoe make appearances but Bale is the whole show. His telephone confession near the end is a sensational piece of film acting.<br /><br />Nonetheless, you may want to deprive your children and elderly parents of this cinematic experience at this particular time in their lives.</p></body></html>

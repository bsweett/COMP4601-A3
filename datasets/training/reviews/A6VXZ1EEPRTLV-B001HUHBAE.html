<meta name="summary" content="reality often isn't as exciting as fiction..."></head><body><p>Based on the activities of the Zodiac Killer, Zodiac (2007) is a dramatization of some of the real life events that occurred in California beginning in 1969.  It's a film that captures quite well the look, feel, and vibe, of the time, and features some very good performances by a strong cast, as the story is mostly told by following the activities of San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith.  The film is based on Graysmith's book "Zodiac".<br /><br />Directed by David Fincher (The Game, Aliens 3), comparisons of Zodiac to his film Se7en (1995) might perhaps be unfair, but are probably inescapable.  Se7en, a tense, edgy, thriller, is general acknowledged as a masterpiece in the serial killer genre, with riveting performances by Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.  Real life seldom plays as dramatically as fiction, and while Zodiac has some truly chilling moments, and does a solid job of storytelling, the overall impact, particularly in light of the way the story concludes, is rather anticlimactic in comparison.  While each film is very dark, with a much tighter focus and an identifiable killer, it is Se7en that probably leaves the more lasting impression, is more rewatchable, and has deservedly developed a huge fanbase.  So unfair as it may be, some may regard Zodiac as falling short in comparison.<br /><br />Zodiac opens with a shooting in a lovers' lane in Vallejo in 1969.  Later, the killer sends letters with coded messages to the newspapers in San Francisco.  Taunting the police and involving the media, have become standard ploys in fictional crime dramas, but back then these were relatively new developments in real life.  The story unfolds following the activities of Chronicle reporters Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), along with SFPD detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards).<br /><br />Graysmith proves to be adept at solving puzzles and tuning into the killer's psychology.  Several murders follow, and the investigation heats up, as the Zodiac killer continues to taunt the police.  The notoriety causes hysteria to grow, however solid leads are scarce, and positive progress regarding the case is slow in coming.<br /><br />The release of Clint Eastwood's movie Dirty Harry (1971), loosely based on the Zodiac case, is featured in the film.  Unfortunately, while Harry Callahan brings his prey to justice in spectacular fashion, the real Zodiac case remains open.  As the years drag on, many of the central figures drop out, eventually leaving Graysmith as one of the few still working on the case.  The film does a fine job of capturing the nature of the investigation, and the toll it takes on those involved.  A fanatical Graysmith continues to investigate, and Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch) emerges as a suspect, but there is no solid physical evidence against him.  Allen dies in 1991, leaving the Zodiac case unsolved, and the film concludes in a somewhat anticlimactic manner.<br /><br />Zodiac deserves high praise for effectively telling the story of the investigation, one that proved not to have a storybook ending.  With some strong acting performances, it's a film worth seeing, but probably not one that many will be anxious to revisit.  It starts out strongly, and nicely builds momentum, but it begins to lose steam in the second half as time begins to stretch out.  David Fincher's interest in doing the film, after having already done Se7en was apparently very personal, as he lived in Northern California at the time of the initial killings, and as a young boy, was affected by the threats Zodiac made against schoolchildren.<br /><br />For those who really want to delve deep into the case history, the two disc director's cut edition contains a ton of informative bonus material, including two commentary tracks (one by Fincher), and an in depth documentary covering the actual investigation.  For those with a casual interest, the single disc director's cut should suffice.</p></body></html>

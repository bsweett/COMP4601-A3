<meta name="summary" content="Very Long"></head><body><p>Something I have recently learned about Oliver Stone movies: They make lousy theater flicks - but they're great to watch on DVD.<br /><br />Think back to JFK, Alexander, and now W. all of these films are too long for a theater showing. Even W., clocking in at 2 hours, seems to stumble on forever.<br /><br />But they're good on DVD because you can turn them off and go live life, and come back to engage once again.<br /><br />W. stars:<br /><br />Josh Brolin as George W. Bush<br />Toby Jones as Karl Rove<br />Jeffery Wright as Colin Powell<br />Thandie Newton (MI:2) as Condi Rice<br />Scott Glenn as Donald Rumsfeld<br />Richard Dreyfuss as Dick Cheney<br />and James Cromwell as George H. W. Bush<br /><br />This film documents George W Bush's rise in politics, his family life and the process that led to the Iraq War.<br /><br />I like how they spun this film: Like him or love him, George W Bush is one of the most controversial persons of our time.<br /><br />This film doesn't cater to any one point of view; they show his drinking problems, they show his turn to faith in Jesus, they show his presidency.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film, but next time, I'll be sure to hit the pause button a few times.</p></body></html>

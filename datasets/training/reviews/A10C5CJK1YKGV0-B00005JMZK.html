<meta name="summary" content="Now part of the canon of the main films ..."></head><body><p>This film definitely benefits from retrospect. After having viewed it now several times I've come down on the side of the fans with this film and not on the side of the haters, of which there are many.<br /><br />When this movie was reported on, most of the mainstream press dismissed it outright as either an over the top combination, too niche of an audience, a bad idea that could ruin both franchises, and so on. After the initial shock wave settled and the movie came out, the box office numbers were pretty dismal and the film was then seen to have under-preformed. The expectation was probably too great to live up to or even meet half-way. Aliens vs. Predator landed with a thud in the theatres as well as on DVD when it was finally released.<br /><br />But with all due respect, the film is greater than it's marketing history and will probably be seen as such in time to come.<br /><br />The story has some surprising elements to it. Lance Henriksen being one of them, playing Charles 'Bishop' Weyland of ... ahem ...Weyland Industries. Yes, now it all makes sense. The whole question of Bishop wants to be answered and is begging to be answered in this film, much like the Terminator Series tries to reverse engineer their own on-screen technology to show you its roots. Henrikson's character is a billionaire industrialist that does it all and has the jump on most modern governments and not-surprisingly more armed than modern governments as well. But in this film, he's the aging, decrepit and frail leader that probably should've stayed home but takes no advice.<br /><br />Overall, the action is good, the story is well-written and engaging. The CG is  flawless and one can tell that a lot of love went into his movie from the inception of the idea and followed it all the way through the process. This is a much better movie than it was given credit for, and AVP holds it own in the world of both Predators and Aliens.<br /><br />And for the record, if you have any doubts at all, this film also looks a million times better once you get a whiff of AVP:R, which was a complete and unmitigated disaster. It's a shame that movie was even made, because AVP:R did what everyone thought this film was going to do to both franchises. It just goes to show how much hard work is required to carry off something of the magnitude achieved in this film. Making a naval gazing, teen slasher movie and trying to pass it off as either an Aliens or Predator production is just downright shameful.<br /><br />Well, as of this date AVP3 is silently in the works and it looks as though AVP:R is just going to be outright ignored in the storyline, and should be. Hopefully AVP3 will pick off where AVP left off.<br /><br />... ...</p></body></html>

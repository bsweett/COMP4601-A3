<meta name="summary" content="Looks Like There's a Consensus Here"></head><body><p>Skimming through all of the other reviews, it appears that whether this movie is rated highly or not everyone agrees that it begins really strong but loses steam about 2/3 of the way through.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film...but you can put me in that category as well.<br /><br />The first half is some of the Coen Brothers' best filmmaking.  The actors are particularly strong in their roles and the storytelling is lean and driven.  Javier Bardem makes the movie, portraying the unstoppable "ghost" (not a literal one but something an old law man likens him to) always one step behind everyone...or ahead of them.  Everyone else you get a good sense of, but this guy you'd like to see more of, like to try to understand more.<br /><br />But the last section of the film isn't as tight and seamless as the first half.  To open a story so well with so little exposition and dialogue, the filmmakers leave us with a unsensational downer ending that looks (sorry) sloppy and undeveloped.<br /><br />Still, a great movie, but--in a weird way--like THE BIG LEBOWSKI: fascinating characters, excellent scenes, compellingly watchable...but uneven.</p></body></html>

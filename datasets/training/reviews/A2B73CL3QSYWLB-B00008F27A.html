<meta name="summary" content="Amusing Comic Horror Swashbuckler"></head><body><p>Your enjoyment of "Army of Darkness" is not totally dependent on seeing the "Evil Dead" films first but it does help.  This film takes something of a departure from the first films in attempting to mainstream the series.  It is more humorous and it is virtually bloodless.  It is also interesting that director Sam Raimi took the series into a time-travel vein.  The action scenes and special effects are terrific.  This film is played for macabre humor as opposed to outright horror.  Star Bruce Campbell just continues to amaze as the series progresses.  He had already proven himself as a comic force in "Evil Dead II" and here he expands himself as an action star something akin to an Errol Flynn or a Harrison Ford.  If you want to wean the squeamish on the series start with this film and go backward.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Taking out the trash"></head><body><p>In the film "Freeway", Reese Witherspoon reinvented the fairy tale character of Little Red Riding Hood as a scrappy survivor capable of rescuing herself from the Big Bad Wolf. In "Hard Candy", Ellen Page goes even further, and plays Little Red Riding Hood as a ruthless vigilante on a mission to punish the Big Bad Wolf for his sins.<br /><br />"Hard Candy" is a taut, intelligent, intense thriller that completely ignores the normal clich&eacute;s of victims, predators, villains and vigilantes. Even more impressive is that the entire film is carried by the two superb performances of Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page. Wilson's Jeff is evil and manipulative to be sure, but he also fills the character with plenty of vulnerability, self-loathing and desperation. Page's Hayley is a true revelation: powerful, brilliant and fearless. By the end of the film you're not sure whether she's an avenging angel or a psychopath ... and since the film doesn't ever provide the viewer with any more justification for her actions than Hayley provides Jeff, you're left to draw your own conclusions. I love that!</p></body></html>

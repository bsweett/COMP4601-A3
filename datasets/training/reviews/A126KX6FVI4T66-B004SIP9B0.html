The movie is a chronicle of how bad things were, somewhat cleaned up for the press? No matter how good Helen Mirren's mimic of Queen Elizabeth was,the point that seems to be missed is that between them Charles and Queen Elizabeth drove Princess Diana to her death?

Royalty as a system involved in government is a failed one.<br />Historically, the casualties have been enormous.</p></body></html>

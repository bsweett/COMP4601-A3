<meta name="summary" content="BETTER THAN EXPECTED! NOT NEARLY AS GORY AS IT'S REPUTATION!"></head><body><p>There's a new monster in horror! Forget the misunderstood variety, like Frankenstein's monster, forget the Atomic bomb causing bugs to grow to enormous size and forget the relentless slashing madmen, like Michael Myers! Today, new horror fans have a new terror, it's the rich self absorbed A-Hole who is bored with his life and wants to torture and kill innocent people....why?... because he can!<br /><br />Hostel II has been labeled one of the goriest films ever made, but it's really a self parody that is pretty entertaining. Oh there is some gore for sure, but nothing like I imagined there would be. I probably would hate both of these 'Hostel' films, but between all the nasty stuff there is a keen sense of wit that flows through both films.<br /><br />The subject matter alone in a shocking setting and there in always tension in the air because you don't know when something really messed up in about to happen. I don't think we need a part 3 in this franchise, but this one is worth a look......if you like this sort of thing! The unrated DVD has an excellent transfer and some interesting extras. It also sports one of the most shocking(and funny) endings I've ever seen!</p></body></html>

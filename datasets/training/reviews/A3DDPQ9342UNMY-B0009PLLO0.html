<meta name="summary" content="Battle fatigue after three hours of heavy conflict..."></head><body><p>Alexander is an ambitious project, whatever one may think of its shortcomings. The script has a hard time pinpointing what makes the great man tick--and it's certainly muddled when it comes to all the conspiracy theories surrounding his youth and manhood. His mother is played by Angelina Jolie as a conniving temptress with an uncanny control over snakes--a control she has over him as well, urging him to become the great leader in battles.<br /><br />Colin Farrell does the best he can with the florid dialog, full of pomposity and Shakespearean grandeur, but it's not a part that he really embodies with any great conviction. He does a workmanlike job but never really becomes the character. Nor is his relationship with his lover (Jared Leto) ever given more of a hint than intense glances can convey, as if Oliver Stone was reluctant to let the homophobic aspects of Alexander's life interfere with the storytelling.<br /><br />The battle scenes are realistic but fatiguing after awhile, following the accepted strategy of other action films by interspersing fierce battles with the quieter moments--but never too quiet since most of the dialog consists of arguments between Alexander and his army of dedicated fighters.<br /><br />Val Killmer gives a vigorous performance as his father Michael, almost unrecognizable in his one-eyed make-up and red beard. Anthony Hopkins serves as a one man Greek chorus, narrating the tale in the manner of a bad DVD commentary. Christopher Plummer does a nice job as Aristotle, teaching the Greek youths about their mission in life.<br /><br />On the plus side, the background score by Vangelis is strikingly effective, as is Rodrigo Prieto's gorgeous cinematography. The look of the film is one of its strongest assets with authentic detail in costumes and settings. But the script is a yawner, going back and forth in time to fill in gaps that were intended to fill the viewer in on some missing points. It's a technique that tries the patience several times throughout the lengthy running time.<br /><br />This should find favor with a very limited audience of history buffs.</p></body></html>

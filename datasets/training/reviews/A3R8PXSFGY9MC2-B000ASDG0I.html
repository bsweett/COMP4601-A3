<meta name="summary" content="Mr and Mrs Smith"></head><body><p>'Mr and Mrs Smith' is a light hearted action/comedy. OK the plot is pretty bad, it has a rubbish ending and it may be a touch too long (all reasons for my 3 stars), but it wasn't trying to win any Oscars and is a fun, fairly innocuous, way to spend an afternoon. There are some funny moments, loads of action scenes and plenty of eye candy for the boys and girls. Some people seem to rate this film based against all others ever made, in that contest it will never win. But as an example of light entertainment it doesn't do too badly. Not brilliant, but not terrible either. Worth spending an afternoon watching when you don't want to think too hard.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

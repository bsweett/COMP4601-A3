<meta name="summary" content="Strong performances, great story!"></head><body><p>No, this is NOT your typical fantasy story.  It's what we expected, and why we rented the movie in the first place.  Rather than be disappointed, we were thrilled at the depth of the story and performances.  Our 7 year old LOVED it, despite the sadness and difficult turn the story took.  She found it to be a "beautiful movie" (her words) and she asked that we keep it an extra night so she could see it again.  She especially liked when the boy became more sensitive and closer to his sometimes "annoying" little sister at the end.  She said that the bridge and his sister would help him to feel better about things.  She couldn't be more right!<br /><br />A must see.  A movie that will teach compassion and caring to our young children.  Not an easy movie at first glance, but parents should NOT be afraid to have their child see something with a bit more substance.  Kids see enough mindless movies, fantasy for the sake of fancy computer graphics, adventure movies that teach nothing other than it's fun to be pirate.  This movie has soul and depth and feeling, and I wouldn't have missed it for the world, and neither should you!</p></body></html>

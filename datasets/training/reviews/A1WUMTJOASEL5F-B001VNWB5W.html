<meta name="summary" content="Apocalypse, or the end of music?"></head><body><p>Im not sure what this movie is celebrating, superheroes, murder mysteries, evil violence, or just the brand new hope for the end of music as we know it, replacing it with the whining voices that have been shunned or set aside all these years, because it is here they make their grand debut out of our consciousness. At any rate, the soundtrack sucks with over political overtones of the lost 60s, and believe me, if the soundtrack sucks (I would exit a bar that played any of this), the movie does too, cause there is no movie classic with soundtrack that sucks.  Even Thank God It's Friday disco movie had an award winning song in Last Dance. Now that was a real exit.</p></body></html>

The movie's plotline derives from Johnny Cash's autobiographies, "Man In Black" and "Cash The Autobiography", which provide an authentic narrative of what the man was about.  The film appears to be two films in one due to its immense content of the film that reveals Cash more in depth.  There are the intimate aspects of the man and his music, and how one of the first couples of country music, John (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter Cash (Reese Witherspoon), came to be making the film a love story about the music and between two people.<br /><br />The film is quite exceptional in capturing the "Man in Black."  Viewers will see the forces that drove him to create a unique blend of music that was all heart and soul: gospel, rock and roll, blues, and country-western.  Joaquin Phoenix's did a well-done depiction of the man, and recreating Cash during the years in which he struggled through his rise to fame, and his brief down and out with drugs.  One can see how Phoenix's performance flowed with Cash's influence within him.  Indeed, Cash helped to kick start rock and roll about the same time as Elvis Presley, especially with his involvement with Sun Records.  His story almost falls into the same lines as Elvis', but Cash's experiences looms deeper and darker than the king, which involved tragedy, blood, sweat, and tears, and final triumph.<br /><br />Walk The Line is recommended for all music lovers, especially those who are curious in understanding the history of rock and roll and the sum of all its parts.</p></body></html>

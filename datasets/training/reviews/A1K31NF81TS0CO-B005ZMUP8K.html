<meta name="summary" content="A Great movie"></head><body><p>I heard this one is fantastic.  While I never see movies in the movie theater, except very rarely, I willl definitly plan to watch this on DVD.  It really rocks the house!<br /><br />I highly recommend getting this on DVD, immediately at launch!<br /><br />EDIT June 5, 2007:<br />Well, how quickly the tides have turned.  This movie franchise was the "golden child" it's first go around, getting loads and loads of awesome support and reviews.  Now look at it.  Just fresh from it's third run from the theater, and getting scathing reviews, movie goers complaining that it's "too long and draggy," plot-less, poor writing, etc. etc. etc."  Well, I viewed this 2nd movie, the first sequel the week it came out on DVD.  And I couldn't stay in my seat.  It was that bad.<br /><br />Boooooring snoozefest.<br /><br />Not recommended!<br /><br />MC White<br /><br />MC White: Said check it out!!!</p></body></html>

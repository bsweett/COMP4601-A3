<meta name="summary" content="If you liked Blood Diamond, watch this."></head><body><p>I recently watched this on cable, so I will not be addressing any DVD features, although with two discs, multiple commentaries, a documentary and more, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BYA5GO">this</a> seems the one to get.<br /><br />By most accounts based on real-life Soviet gunrunner Viktor Bout (currently in U.S. custody), Lord of War made twice as much money overseas as it did in America. Certainly, I had never heard of it. With an R rating and plenty of graphic violence not to mention drug use, this is definitely a film for mature audiences.<br /><br />Having said all that, I think this is an excellent film. Unlike many recent examples of Nic Cage pulling down a paycheck, he is both less likable and more believable here. While simultaneously glorifying and dehumanizing Cage's Yuri Orlov, director Andrew Niccol presents a reality where a long line of willing successors is ready to take his place. The world needs guns like it does food or water.<br /><br />This isn't another Bruckheimer/Bay pyrotechnics orgy. While explosions have not been completely excised, Lord of War is actually closer to Oscar-darling Blood Diamond, released over a year later. The latter cost twice as much to make. To be fair, it also earned more than twice as much in revenue.<br /><br />I am not always a proponent of voiceovers, but at least it is consistent in timbre and frequency here. Bridget Moynahan is stunning, Jared Leto is very good as the black sheep brother, however I feel the Interpol agent could have been played by someone with less star power than Ethan Hawke, who for some reason was channeling Peter Berg.<br /><br />The film's opening (the life cycle of a round of ammunition) sets the tone. My other favorite scene is the stripped Antonov An-12. (No spoilers here; see--and enjoy--for yourself.)<br /><br />NOTE:<br /><br />Director Andrew Niccol was said to have purchased real AK-47s for filming because they were cheaper than prop guns. That may be so, at least in the former Eastern Bloc Czech Republic where filming took place, but Niccol is laboring under the misconception that reducing access to firearms will reduce crime in the real world. (As if criminals followed all the rules!) In fact, the opposite is true. American cities like Chicago and Washington, D.C. have historically had much higher incidence of violent crime while also having the highest barriers to individual gun ownership.<br /><br />"I hope the United States takes note that the murder rate is lower where gun availability is lower."

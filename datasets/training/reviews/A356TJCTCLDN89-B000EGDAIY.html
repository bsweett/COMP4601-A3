It's very cool and cerebral and a little dull for long periods and then it wakes you up with a nasty scare. It's not great but it's hardly  the worst movie either. Sarah Michelle Gellar is basically playing Buffy without powers and without the neurosis. She's saddled with a cute but dumb as dirt boyfriend who, like the boyfriend in The Ring turns out to be fairly useless. Since I brought up The Ring I have to say that my first feeling about the Grudge was that it was a Ring rip off. When the ghost comes crawling down the stairs it looks just like Samara Morgan coming out of the TV but after watching a few Japanese horror movies I've come to the conclusion that the ghosts in this particular genre tend be grotesquely misshapen things that creep and have messy hair.<br /><br />The Grudge was okay. I wouldn't buy it and I'm glad I didn't see it in the theaters but it has its moments.</p></body></html>

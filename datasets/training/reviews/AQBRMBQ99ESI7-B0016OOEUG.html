<meta name="summary" content="Mixed Up Murder Mystery"></head><body><p>This one is a noir classic. Gene Tierney plays a beautiful, socially prominent victim of a murder. The detective assigned to investigate the murder manages to fall in love with her just through her portrait. Even so, he does his best to investigate a really convoluted murder. He must contend with her fianc&eacute;, played by Vincent Price in a non-horror role, and her professional mentor, a self important snob who wanted to be her fianc&eacute;. It's a complicated investigation that becomes even more complicated when she turns up alive.<br /><br />Somebody else has been murdered and the socialite becomes a suspect when she is less that forthcoming in the investigation. That puts the detective in a hard position because he still loves her but is committed to getting things right.<br /><br />The primary suspect is changed more often than Elizabeth Taylor changes husbands but, in both cases, that helps to maintain interest. It's a nice, if old fashioned, murder mystery.<br /><br />The musical score is also quite memorable. I didn't realize where it had come from until I saw it in this film. It was familiar without my knowing its source before this.</p></body></html>

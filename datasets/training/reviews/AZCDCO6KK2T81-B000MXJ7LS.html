<meta name="summary" content="Haunting"></head><body><p>This is a very hard film to review as one can misinterpret a negative comment as a smear on the memory of those who died and survived 9/11.  This film does have its flaws and weaknesses, but more importantly this film celebrates the American spirit in our ability to overcome great trials and tribulations, to find greatness in tragedy, strength in our weakest moment, and hope in our dispair.  This is Oliver Stone's most human and relatable work yet.  The images are haunting and memorable and our tragedy is relived here with compassion, dignity, and great reverance.  Stone seemed to recognize that this could not be another vanity film for him as this film isn't about him.<br /><br />The acting is first rate by all the principal players.  The cast is filled with many familiar faces from television and film.  The script is intelligently written and very believable.  The score is appropriately haunting and uplifting all at once.  The photography and effects are done with great care and class.  We never see the towesr get hit by the planes which I'm sure was a very tempting special effect to include, but wisely avoided.  Instead we get the shadow of the plane on the buildings around the towers and outstanding sound effects that make you feel like you are actually there hearing the planes hit.  The sound effects reminded me very much of that 70's disaster flick "Earthquake" that was filmed in something called sensurround sound.  In addition, the action is slowed down and all other sounds are muted during the impact moments.<br /><br />Stone also wisely includes the terrible moments of people jumping from the towers, but in a very limited fashion.  We only see one person fall, but throughout the early scenes we hear the horrible sounds of bodies hitting the pavement, but never see the impacts.  Again, another wise decision by Stone (but, damn, if those sounds don't linger in your head long after the film is over).  One's heart can't help but be touched by the hopelessness those felt in the upper floors of the towers.  Much praise goes to Stone for carefully and respectfully selecting what we see and hear in this film.  He wisely realized that the impact of that day can be felt without actually being seen.  We don't even see the towers collapse and we don't need to.  The sounds goes right through you when you see this film.  It truely is and experience to watch this film.  A sound-effects editing Oscar would be well-earned by this film.<br /><br />The film also realistically captures the chaos and confusion on that fateful day when we just didn't know what was happening.  The various miscommunications are believable and heartwrenching and, I think, bring about a better understanding of what our heroes were faced with that day.<br /><br />The downside of this film is it's length.  It is 2 hours and 10 minutes long and it could have easily been edited down to about 1:40 minutes or so.  There are just too many repeated shots (the trapped men looking up at the light) and long shots of nothing happening.  I'm sure that Stone wanted us to feel trapped with these men and experience in some way their hopeless situation and feeling of confinement, but it does get to be tedious at times and you want to simply fast forward the film.  There is also the endless dialogue of "we're gonna make it.  Just hang in there", which I'm sure these trapped men must have said numerous times, but as an audience, we get very restless with these limited scenes that seem to drag on too long.<br /><br />Finally, in spite of the films few flaws, it is very haunting and memorable.  We are not likely to ever forget the events of 9/11, but films like this are a great tribute to our American spirit and memorial to our heroes and bring to life the events some of us may have had trouble accepting as reality that day.  Being native New Yorkers now living in Lancaster, PA, the events of 9/11 have always felt a bit surreal to me and my wife.  I watched the towers be built.  My dad would take me to see the construction site periodically and it was always memorable.  My wife worked on the 98th floor of the North tower in the mid-1980's.  I even considered proposing to her there on the observation deck, but chose the more romantic Empire State Building.  I periodically worked for a department store located at the base of the towers when my wife worked there.  We would meet for lunch sometimes between the towers.  It is hard to grasp that anyone who worked with us back then who may have still worked there that day are gone.<br /><br />We have not been back to New York since 9/11.  We have not seen Ground Zero.  We have not seen the new Manhattan skyline which is now different than we last remembered.  We have not fully grieved for the lives lost that day and for whatever old co-workers we may have lost.  While some criticize Hollywood for exploiting the events of 9/11 for profit, I would rather think that films like this honor our fallen heroes, praise and uplift our survivors, and create an avenue for those who haven't fully grasped or grieved for the losses that day, an opportunity to do so.  I hope to visit Ground Zero at some point.  I'm still not ready.  Films like this may help to get me ready for a trip I know I have to make one day.</p></body></html>

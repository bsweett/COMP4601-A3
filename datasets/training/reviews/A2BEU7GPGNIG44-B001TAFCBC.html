<meta name="summary" content="Acting, Directing and Writing In Sync"></head><body><p>It's not often that I find films were I think that the writing and the directing and the acting are all in sync, but "Eternal Sunshing Of The Spotless Mind" is one of those films.  Although confusing at times, it is a thought provoking film, I'm sure that people at times have wanted to erase people or events from their minds.  One thing my husband pointed out about the relationship between Kate Winslet's character and Jim Carrey's character is although they argued  and fussed at times it was a somewhat accurate portrayel of a couple, although they have their ups and downs at the end of the day they really loved each other.  The time line of the film screwed with my head and I felt confused at times but in the end I think I got it. The concept of the film transferred onto the finished project quite well.</p></body></html>

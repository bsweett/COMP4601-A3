American films and therefore American audiences generally expect something with more bang for their buck. Bigger, flashier, faster is normally what we get. And there are films that that philosophy serve well. But films from other countries, especially countries that tend to be a little colder temperature-wise, are much more deliberately paced. The movement in a film like LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is a little more staccato, like someone moving through snow and ice. Some steps are very slow and methodical, and the next steps may require faster movement in order to stay upright.<br /><br />This is not to say that LET THE RIGHT ONE IN moves in an uneven rhythm; quite the opposite. It's a film that keeps its pace and its tone very consistent. To call this film a "horror" film is akin to calling WALL-E an "animated" film. It's pigeon-holing it and doing it a serious injustice. With all the hyperbole on the case for the DVD for this film, people are going to more than likely be expecting something that moves quickly and has lots of gore and sexuality, as most vampire films do. But that is just not happening in this film.<br /><br />A lot has been said about the story of this film, and I don't have anything to add to that, but as far as my thoughts about this film are concerned, with a few exceptions, I just couldn't recommend a film from 2008 as highly. The two young leads have a chemistry together that puts most adult screen couples to shame. There is never a moment that seems forced, false or out of place. The dialogue, direction, and cinematography are all some of the finest that you'll see in a film all year. It's an extrememly moody film, that has moments of raw emotional brutality and shocking violence, because when it happens, you don't expect it, and that's exactly what makes a film like this work so incredibly well. Violence never should be telegraphed with a film of this kind. It should come as a bolt out of the blue that leaves your jaw hitting the ground, and that's exactly what LET THE RIGHT ONE IN does.<br /><br />And there are moments in the film that you'll never forget.<br /><br />Many fans of the vampire horror genre have been waiting for the definitive vampire film, and this may not have the epic sweep of something like Neil Jordan's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE or the hyperkinetic bloodletting of one of the BLADE films or the nostalgia of the DRACULA films, but this is definitely the best "vampire" film that I've ever seen, and ranks amongst the best of 2008.</p></body></html>

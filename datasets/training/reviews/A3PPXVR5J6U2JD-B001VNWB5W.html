In the past, it was clear that the director's vision eclipsed any fan interest, which resulted in the Batman series kicked off by Tim Burton eventually circling the toilet bowl before being flushed by Joel Schumacher.  The tide has reversed, with fanboys-turned-directors like Peter Jackson, Robert Rodriguez, and Guillermo del Toro showing an almost slavish devotion to the source material. Zack Snyder can now add his name to that list.<br /><br />Watchmen takes place in an alternate reality where the threat of weapons of mass destruction looms large, thanks in part to superheroes who range in sanction from government agents to violent outlaws. They are gods among men, these superheroes, but they are also deeply flawed human beings.  Watchmen is their story.<br /><br />There's remarkably little superhero-action in Watchmen.  When you strip away all the distractions like the altered timeline and the murder mystery, it becomes clear that Watchmen is actually a character study.  The film ping-pongs between each character's backstory, slowly peeling back each layer until we get to the conclusion: that people do terrible things for good reasons. Unfortunately, some characters are fleshed out more than others.<br /><br />Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), the Question-like stand-in, is the most interesting character, an anti-hero filled with the rage of moral absolutism, right at home in a repressive society. He also provides noir-style narrative throughout Watchmen.<br /><br />Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), who has an uncanny resemblance to a young Chevy Chase, is basically an alternative Batman in search of a cause.  He's largely a cipher here, cast primarily as the potential love interest of Silk Spectre.<br /><br />Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) provides the emotional center of the film but unfortunately doesn't do much for women's rights - she comes off as emotionally conflicted and petulant.<br /><br />The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a Punisher analogue whose death at the beginning of the film provides much of the movie's structure, is also a relative unknown.  His nickname is derived from his sociopathic detachment, killing with glee.  Unfortunately, he just comes off as a murderous thug.<br /><br />Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is perfect as a mildly contemptuous superhuman, more alien and powerful than Superman. His mere existence can cause nations to go to war.  Unfortunately, the film struggles with defining the limits of his powers - I half expected Manhattan to change time and space (like Superman did in the 1978 film) to "fix" things.<br /><br />Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), perhaps the most important character in the film, is inexplicably both the most brilliant man on earth and a supreme martial artist. There's nothing in Ozymandias' background to explain why this is.  His complete lack of development compared to the other characters is where Watchmen stumbles.<br /><br />Watchmen is a really interesting take on superheroes.  Unfortunately, it is no longer revolutionary as it might have been, because the 80s comic laid the framework for serious superhero comics that came later, which in turn spawned serious superhero movies like The Dark Knight.  In other words, Watchmen might have been a genre-shaking film ten years ago.  It's less successful as an entertaining film today. It's a museum replica of comic book history, faithful to its medium and appreciated more as a reference than a movie experience.</p></body></html>

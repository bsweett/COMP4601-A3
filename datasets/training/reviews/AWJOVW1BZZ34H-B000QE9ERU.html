<meta name="summary" content="The punisher shouldn't play games."></head><body><p>In this version, Thomas Jane is the punisher. After his family is murdered by a crime boss he goes after the crime bosses family. It wasn't as true to the comic book as I would have liked. Frank Castle seemed to be playing a lot of games with the criminals instead of just killing them when he had the chance. Also, they made the punisher seem kind of weak in spots and not the unstoppable monster that he usually is.<br />I will say that Thomas Jane is a better actor than Dolph Lungren and there was more of a story in this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="alternative myth"></head><body><p>More has been written on this historical event than any other in history and I'll add a couple worthless lines of my own (if for no other reason than for some reason I decided to write up a bunch of reviews for spy/ conspiracy flicks on Amazon). I have virtually no interest in JFK or who killed him or why. The president that exists in popular imagination and media is largely a fabrication. The very fact Kennedy's brief time in the White House came to labeled "Camelot" perfectly illustrates mankind's tragic susceptibility to propaganda and favoring of myth over mere facts and empirical evidence. Always look at the voting record. Always look at the record. First thing to say is this is a movie. People always are saying, "It's just a movie" and of course often times because somebody they're responding to at least in their judgement is taking things too seriously. Well, I'd venture to say that this is indeed a great and in some ways brilliant movie, especially the editing. JFK is a classic crime mystery and political thriller. 4.5 Stars for the movie. However, Oliver Stone's JFK is not a subsitute for reading some of the many books--some of which aren't crazy at all--on this event. Oliver Stone wanted his film to challenge the official story, particularly the Warren Commission Report which he simply regards "a great myth". Stone took it upon himself to fight this myth, "And in order to fight a myth, maybe you have to create another one, a countermyth". Keep this in mind when considering the movie.<br /><br />For my part I think Oswald did it and probably acted alone with nobody else involved in planning and carrying out the hit. A case hasn't been made to really convict any other individual or group even if there have indeed been many doubts and suspicions cast, most of which are unreasonable. But what if "X" individual or group was involved? What of it now? Without getting into the byzantine labyrinth of JFK assassination conspiracy theories I'd just briefly mention that as far as the bigger ones go in which fairly large numbers of people are involved--sometimes from different governmental agencies and other groups--these are mostly discredited by the fact that their isn't more proof of them and at this late date no death bed confessions.<br /><br />And here we are as I add my 2 cents and people are still obsessing over this assassination. If you want to know what you can do for your country I would at least guess Kennedy would be of the opinion that you'd serve the common good by focusing on the many problems at hand, in the world now, geting involved with others doing work--taking action--to make America a great nation and in doing this you would best serve the idealism that JFK came to symbolize. That's how you fight the forces of darkness. Besides you don't ask what the government can do for you because it doesn't care about doing any good for most citizens--you join with other citizens to force the government to live up to its promise. The president isn't who you place your hopes and dreams in for the country.</p></body></html>

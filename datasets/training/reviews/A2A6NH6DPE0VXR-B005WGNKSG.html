<meta name="summary" content="Just watch this version, who needs an American remake ?"></head><body><p>In this first movie that's the beginning of a series of Swedish films, famous reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) teams up with hacker Lisbeth (Noomi Rapaca) to solve the case of a woman that disappeared 40 years ago.<br /><br /> We find out only a little about Lisbeth in this first film, for one she hates men for a good reason. For one, a slimy wealthy man gives her money in return for sexual favors and he's also abusive. So when she meets Mikael, she has trust issues. While he is fresh off of a divorce and has issues of his own. But how they bond is touching and intriguing and what makes this violent and even often disturbing film work so well. Since their relationship is moving and Mikael and Rapaca have great chemistry.<br /><br />  Critic A.O Scott some how didn't like this well made thriller, yet he's looking forward to the American remake ? I don't get it. Don't wait for that version because some how they cast the girl from the Nightmare on Elm Street remake as Lisbeth when Kiera Knightley would have been perfect. Plus why wait until next year to see that version, when this version is out and it's not bad. While you also have the sequel coming out on dvd October 26th and the 3rd film coming soon after, so why wait years and years to get the whole story to unfold Hollywood style.</p></body></html>

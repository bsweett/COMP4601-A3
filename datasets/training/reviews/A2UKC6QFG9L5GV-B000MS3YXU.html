<meta name="summary" content="WHAT WAS THAT?"></head><body><p>First off I'd like to say I'm M. Night Shyamalan's fan. I love all of his works although I haven't met a person yet who'd like them all. Some prefer "The Sixth Sense" and "Signs", but don't like "The Village", others adore "Unbreakable" while being sceptical about "The Sixth Sense"... I love them all. And I never had prejudice about this "twist thing" - when I knew "Lady in the Water" would be a totally different picture, without usual Shyamalan's tricks, I was OK with it. A director doesn't need to repeat himself all the time and stay in the framework of the genre he created (may I suppose so) to be successful hereafter. And when I heard annoyed exclamations "A film about a mermaid? That must be crap!" I told those people to wait till they see the new work of almighty genius. And boy - did I make a joke on myself...<br /><br />You know the story, I think, so there's no need to repeat it. But I must say when I was leaving a theater I was thinking: "So what did he want to tell us with this?" And what's worse I still didn't come up with any answer. If "Lady in the Water" was supposed to be a fairy-tale for kids, it's so dull, motionless and deprived of any action that kids would be falling asleep in theaters. Besides there's a couple of really scary and jumpy moments apparently not suitable for kids. And if this is for adults... Well, what was this that I saw?! We got an unsophisticated and plain story that goes nowhere with practically nothing going on, and almost with no sense. I read multiple reviews and articles to catch this sense, to find some interpretation. And I found nothing. Just idle and void sentences about how people unlearned to see good things in life and how "Lady in the Water" is not about fairy-tale itself but about how people tend to percept fairy-tales. So what? Actually I didn't have a chance to see that in the film. And even if I did - what an absurd idea of a movie.<br /><br />When I said about the genre Shyamalan created I was talking about his pictures meant for wide audiences, his films are still pop culture but shaped to bear some higher meaning, some idea. Like "The Sixth Sense" was about how a person can absolutely not see what's happening around him and how a boy with seemingly big problems helped main character to discover his own, much bigger problems. "Unbreakable" was about how our life may not be exactly what it seems to be at first glance and about some personal overcoming. "Signs" was about that nothing in life is accidental, that everything has its reason and finally - that there is God. "The Village" was about how good intentions and seemingly right choices sometimes lead us to what we try to avoid so much. It's about life itself which has its own rules and which is doing everything its way.<br />All Shyamalan's thoughts were always wrapped in a glittering thriller paper and it worked just fine. Shyamalan who until this moment had made only four big pictures became one of those directors who are capable to attract audience to the theaters with just his name in the credits. With all my respect I think people didn't come to see his movies because of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Mel Gibson and Adrien Brody. People were coming to see M. Night Shyamalan's films. "Lady in the Water" also has a great cast. So what? It just perishes in a mediocre movie with no sense, no sparkle and no life. "Lady in the Water" has great cinematography and music. So what? It has a lot of cinephile jokes and allusions e.g. the episodes with the critic. So what, so what, so what?<br /><br />There was a moment when I started thinking that maybe I'm just stupid and don't understand anything. But then I thought that usually I understand movies besides I couldn't find any intelligible opinions about "Lady in the Water". I'm far from thinking Shyamalan was a big soap bubble that just bursted with a thunderous bang. I will pretend I didn't see this film and wait for his another work.</p></body></html>

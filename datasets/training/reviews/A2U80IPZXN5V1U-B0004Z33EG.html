<meta name="summary" content=""I Didn't Come to Protect  Rambo From You,I Came to Protect You From Rambo"-Colonel Trautman"></head><body><p>In 1982 Sylvester Stallone releases yet another fantastic movie with "First Blood",the first in the Rambo series."First Blood" was inspired by David Morrell's epic novel of the same name.While it doesn't take entirely what is in the book and that many parts if not nearly each of them were written by Stallone himself.It is to notice that Stallone gave Rambo a more human perspective of the character than Morrell did.There have been three sequels that followed but whom all failed to reach the level of the first : "First Blood Part 2"(1985),"Rambo III"(1988) and the more recent "Rambo" in 2008.Decades latter and First Blood is still an amazing movie providing you both action and thrills.Stallone managed to bring two memorable franchises,Rocky And Rambo wich became some of America's most beloved movies.<br /><br />In First Blood Stallone plays the role of John Rambo a Green Beret vet who went to Vietnam and was trained to kill.Rambo searches for the last of his comrades from the Green Berets days,and finds out he died from cancer a few years ago.He walks to a nearby town and is trown out of the town by Sheriff William Teasle.Rambo comes back and is "roughed up" by the cops who without knowing they had made a new powerfull ennnemy.John escapes and the police chases him.He then shows us how much of a killing machine he is by setting up traps and killing.That's when Colonel Samuel Trautman(who was initialy going to be played by Kirk Douglas and at the last minute it all changed)comes in.He claims to be the only one who can stop Rambo as he trained him and obeyed him.It turns out to be a terrific action movie full of suspense and at the same time full of drama and intense moments.Let me tell you if you enjoy movies with any of the mentionned above you are likely to love this movie.<br /><br />The special features.It is known already that the movie itself is incredible as well as a must see classic.The features from previous releases are gone for the most part,and the commentaries by the "First Blood" novel creator David Morrell are not included anymore wich is a shame considering he talked about many things and gave lots of helpfull information.The alternate endings are still there including the ending when Rambo killed himself which was the original ending of the movie before it was changed because of bad reactions to the ending.There are many possibilities for audio and visual with the metascopes and others that let you wtahc the film in different ways.I wonder why they cutted the extras,they did the same for the Rocky remasters.My advice : if you have the older versions don't get these you won't get anything new.its not worth it.If you cans score one of these "Special Editions" then you might consider yourself to have gotten a great deal.Those "Ultimate Editions" aren't so ultimate after all.<br /><br />"First Blood" stands as a classic and a must have.It does not suit everyone be advised so have to know a minimum on the movie before you actually rent and/or buy it.As mentionned above those editions aren't the best and the older editions are much better.Yet this one is easier to find and ainvailable nearly everywhere DVDs are sold which is pretty much the only advantage with these Ultimate editions.You can also save a lot by buying the "Ultimate Edition" boxed set of the first three Rambo.Overral,one of Stallone's crowning achievements and best work AND one of my favourite movies of all time.The best Rambo movie out of the four.You can't go wrong by picking this up if you are a fan of action movies and/or Sylvester Stalone,I liked both so this definatly worked for me.<br /><br />NOTE: A few weeks prior to writting this review the fourth Rambo was released,"Rambo",in theatres January 25th 2008(I will get to that in another review).</p></body></html>

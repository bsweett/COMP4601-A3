<meta name="summary" content="Not The Sequel You Expect- But, Tops The First"></head><body><p>What happens when two toatlly opposite families combine?- You've got yourself:Meet The Fockers. It's the sequel that we "Meet The Parents" fans have waited three or four long years for... and guess what- it tops the first! When I went to see this sequel I thought it would not live up to the high standards set out in the first one but,this comedy managed to pass my expectations and keep me reasonably entertained. It's a good feel good and roll over laughing movie.<br /><br />Unlike the first that had suddle humour this movie was over the top and maybe not the sequel you will expect to see but, it still manages to be a nice chapter in Gaylord's acceptance and approval from his father-in-law Jack.<br /><br />Of course you know their will be casosis as the two families meet for the first time The Fockers- have always been touchy, feely, coddling and admiring parents- who love Gaylord no matter what he achieves even displaying his collection of eigth and ninth place ribbons. While the Byrnes have always had family secrets and have expected nothing less than perfection Jack even trys to pass that perfect onto the next generation of Byrnes by, making his grandson Little Jack into a baby genius by teaching him sign language and using a new method in which the youngster has to comfort himself rather than be coddled by others. The two families could not be more differant and when they meet all hell breaks loose... first of all Greg's mom is a sex therapist and her and her husband are not afraid to engage in loud activities and touching eachother- something distrubs Jack straight away... followed by the fact that Greg's dad left the position as a high-powered attroney to stay at home and care for Greg... the two families collide in a mishaps of events from showing sercumsion photos, to flushing a dog down the toliet, to Greg learning he may have a son with the woman he lost his virginity too, and Greg's mom helping Mrs. Byrnes' with some bedroom issues. Before Greg knows it he finds himself outside the circle of trust and on top of that- Pam's pregnant so they need to speed up the wedding date. But, can they when Jack dosn't approve?<br /><br />Ben Stiller is great along with great performances by DeNiro, Hoffman-who is a real comedian despite what I believed at first and Streisand does a half-way decent job herself.<br /><br />I laughed out loud watching this movie and in my opinon it's just as funny if not funnier than the first and I can't wait to have it my collection. I just hope we haven't meet the last of this movie series!</p></body></html>

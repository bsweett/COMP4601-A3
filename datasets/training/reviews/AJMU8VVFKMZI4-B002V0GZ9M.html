Bullock films tend to be either a hit or miss, more often miss, so it's understandable to be stunned when one catches you by surprise.  For the longest time, I kept hearing people question how they owned the same dog and to those I say "pay attention to the movie"-it explains Alex leaving the dog with Morgan and Morgan then giving the dog to his then girlfriend, Kate.  Reeves, a mediocre actor who has either the best agent in the world or a keen sense for winning scripts, gives a performance reminisant of "A Walk in the Cloud" and the results are just as sweet.  I was confused to how the bus incident could happen and upon second viewing, I realize that she couldn't save him until 2008 so then it all made sense and it's a definite winner in my book.  Highly, highly recommended.</p></body></html>

(Oh, and lots of whining from Tarantino about "RD" didn't win an Oscar when it came out.)<br /><br />I first saw this movie at age 14 and and was not too interested in anything but the violence.  Upon re-watching it, though, one can't help but understand why, for better or worse, Tarantino is a legend.<br /><br />Mr White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr Brown (the director in an unnecessary but amusing cameo), the psychopathic Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), and the short lived Mr. Blue (Edward Bunker) are given these colorful names by Las Vegas mobb boss Joe Cabot (in a hilarious turn by the late Lawrence Tierney) in an effort to keep things not so close between the career criminals.  Though it is a simple jewel heist, he does not want any of these guys to know each others' backgrounds, rap sheets, or any personal information at all.  Without spoilers, this most certainly does not work out.<br /><br />Beyond all the flashy brutality, violence, and racism which QT is known well for, this movie is really about the relationship between Mr. White and Mr. Orange.  With the stone cold Mr. Blonde in the background, handled by Nice Guy Eddie (the late Chris Penn in a terrifying role as Cabot's son), the badly wounded Mr. Orange is Mr. White's main concern.  Handling him like a wounded child, combing his hair, ferociously defending him from any accusations of being the man who tipped off the cops and set off the alarm, Keitel's performance is what makes it worth it.  As Mr. Pink screams at him for having disclosed information to his wounded companion, the actor's gaze is spacy, strange.  Why is he so cold when talking about his life long boss and companion Joe?  Why does not care about the rules?  Has this wounded, almost Christlike figure lying on the ground made him think twice about his life of crime?  Is the goodness of Mr. Orange throwing him off his game?  Is he the son he never had?<br /><br />Tarantino offers no easy answers and obviously had no intention of spoonfeeding the viewer.  While this is a remorselessly vicious movie with some of the worst specimens humanity has to offer, there is something tremendously moving about it.  A must for any lover of film--"Stuck In the Middle With You" will always make you perk your ears up after seeing this movie, in a manner of speaking.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

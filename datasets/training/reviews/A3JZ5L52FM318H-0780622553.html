<meta name="summary" content="Great flick for genre fans, so-so Blu-Ray"></head><body><p>The film:<br /><br />Dark City is one of the standout science fiction movies of the 1990s, along with Gattaca, The Matrix, Total Recall, and Starship Troopers. It portrays a bizarre world in which humans live in an eternal night and are manipulated by a group of strange creatures known as the Strangers.<br /><br />The sense of claustrophobia and dread are well developed, and the setting, which uses evocative period details, especially art deco and 50's modern styles, is eerie and cool. Definitely watch the Director's Cut - there is really no reason to watch the theatrical cut, which shortens a few scenes and adds a terrible voice over the spoils the mystery at the very beginning of the film. This is a film that rewards multiple viewings, and the DC is the way to go to get the most out of it.<br /><br />I will say that I found one moment at the conclusion kind of annoying and pat. Basically, it was a line of dialogue in which Sewell's character avers that the essence of humanity is in some sort of soul, whilst pointing to his heart. Blargh. How cheesy. But overall, the momentum of the story, the creepiness, and the unsettling plays on identity and memory work very well.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />Detail is middling for a Blu-Ray. Certainly, it is superior to the awful original DVD. But digital noise reduction has scrubbed away some detail, especially in faces. Rufus Sewell and Jennifer Connelly's faces in particular have a waxy look that is noticeable. There is no film grain whatsoever, which is a bad thing, since the computer programs that reduce grain tend to scrub away those fine details mentioned above. It's not the sort of transfer that's going to beat you over the head by "looking HD." Brightly lit scenes fare much better in terms of detail, which is part of the issue in a film called "Dark City." There are several scenes which are very strong, showing good detail in cloth, or textures of walls, streets, etc. If you let it work on you for 2 hours, there are pleasing things to be found, and to be sure, it's not awful. It's just not as good as it could have been.<br /><br />Production documentaries total about 1 hour 20 minutes, and there are 3 commentaries on the Director's Cut, two commentaries on the theatrical. Overall, it's a nice selection of extras, especially for a "catalog" release of a not terribly successful film.<br /><br />**********<br />For the price, any fan of science fiction with a Blu-Ray player should pick this up. It's a very strong science fiction plot with a lot of good creepiness and a few mind twisting themes. It's well acted, and the selection of extras, especially a superior Director's Cut, make this a fine purchase. It's too bad that the transfer was manhandled in such a overpowering way with DNR, but it's still superior to the DVD, and, while it is not among the best HD transfers on Blu-Ray, it's at least as good as very good cable TV HD.</p></body></html>

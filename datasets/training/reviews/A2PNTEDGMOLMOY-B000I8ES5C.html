<meta name="summary" content="The most surprising movie since the "Fargo""></head><body><p>On the recommendation of a friend, I picked up Stephen Chow's "Kung-Fu Hustle" -- "It's a martial arts comedy," he said.  He may have committed the worst case of under-selling a product I've ever come across.<br /><br />"Kung-Fu Hustle" contains the most surprising, you'll-never-see-this-coming humor I've seen in a movie since I saw Steve Buscemi's leg (with sock) meeting its destiny in a woodchipper in the Coen brothers' "Fargo."  I will be brief, so as not to spoil any of the surprises for you, but without giving too much away, you will see subtle and not-so-subtle references to such moments as Sean Connery's death scene in "The Untouchables," the "hallway of blood" from "The Shining," the fight scenes from "The Matrix," and the Roadrunner versus Wile E. Coyote.<br /><br />Some movies, such as Stanley Tucci's "Big Night," just make you smile with their tone and general warmth.  I never thought I'd say that about a martial arts film, but from the moment the Axe Gang shows up in "Reservoir Dogs" apparel, kills a few gangsters, and then dances some fantastic mish-mash step/line dancing, I was enthralled with "Kung Fu Hustle."  Also, who can't love a movie mainly set in "Pig Sty Alley," ruled by the Landlady, a witty spoof of all "dragon lady" stereotypes.<br /><br />Avoid all reviews and spoilers for this movie -- while I expect "Kung Fu Hustle" will hold up on repeated viewings, I will never again be as surprised or thrilled as I was the first time I saw it.  A wonderful addition to the film library.</p></body></html>

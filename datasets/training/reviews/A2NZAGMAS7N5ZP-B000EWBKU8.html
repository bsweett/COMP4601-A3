Before Die Hard there really wasn't any action heroes; I mean besides Rambo, Die hard created the Epitome of the new era of action. And this can be proven with the many imitations that followed Die Hard's success. Such titles include Speed (Die Hard on a bus) Under Siege (Die Hard on a boat) and Passenger 57 (Die Hard on a plane) all of these movies were made prior to the success of Die Hard<br /><br />Die Hard's story is known by practically everyone. But for those who are unfamiliar here it goes. John McCLane is a New York Police Officer, he is on his way to Los Angeles to visit his wife and children to celebrate Christmas together...but there is something wrong, a group of professional terrorists...Or better say thieves are taking hostage of a whole building. And in this building McLane's wife is also among the group. The thieves are prepared and have everything planned out. They have weaponry, technology, and professional men...but there is one thing they weren't counting on...John McClane. He is in the building and ready to rock. Die hard till this day is one of the best and probably the best action movie ever made, and it's probably because it's a fresh story, we can relate to the character. He is a character who gets the job done but doesn't want to be there, he just does what he has to do because there is no other choice. And also we have someone who bleeds; we see every bruise, every cut. The character is human so it feels real. These are the qualities that make die hard till this day one of the best action movies of all time. This is a must own by all movie fans out there.

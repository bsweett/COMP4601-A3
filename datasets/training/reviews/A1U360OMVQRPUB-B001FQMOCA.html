<meta name="summary" content="Solid Love Story"></head><body><p>Even though WALK THE LINE is labeled a biopic about June and Johnny Cash, it's also a solid love story that will stand for years.  Gradually the memories of the couple's musical performances will fade, but the memory of their love transcends simple history.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix shines as Johnny Cash, the romantic and the troubled drug user, and as the man who lost a brother.  Joaquin probably used the loss of his own brother, River, in preparing emtionally for the role, but that had to have been very hard.  Reese Witherspoon makes acting look effortless.<br /><br />The movie carries Johnny Cash from his early years, through the tragic loss of his brother, to his love for music.  I remember listening to his songs when I was a kid, but I didn't know that he toured with and around Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis.  I only knew his country years.<br /><br />The scenes and settings feel right and look right.  The visual storytelling gets choppy and leaves a lot out, but it keeps in all the good stuff as well as keeping the story moving along at a fast clip.<br /><br />Even though everyone knows that Johnny and June will get together, it's still emotional and uplifting when he proposes to her on stage during a live performance.  The chemistry between the actors is great.  This is one of those movies that fans will watch again and again.  And if you haven't seen it, you should take the time to do so.  If you're not drawn in by the legends, see it for the acting quality.  Either way you're going to enjoy the film.</p></body></html>

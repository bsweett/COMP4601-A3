As with their previous collaboration, Mortensen plays  conflicted character Nikolai a member of the Russian mob who crosses paths with a British midwife named Anna (an excellent Naomi Watts) who is much more than the "driver" for Russian mob leader Seymon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) he pretends to be.<br /><br />The provocative and moving story has some nice twists and turns in the screenplay by Steven Knight ("Amazing Grace")but the film truly comes alive due to the strong performances of Mortensen, Watts, Mueller-Stahl and Victor Cassel as Seymon's son Kirill. Featuring a dazzling, brutal and shocking fight sequence set in a steambath (something that Hitchcock in his prime might have tried), Cronenberg creates a fascinating tapestry to hang his often stunning visuals on. He continues to mature and become richer as a film director with the passage of time. A few folks complained about the resolution of the film but I actually felt that the way Cronenberg handled the conclusion was the opposite of a Hollywood ending and worked extremely well.<br /><br />Although a bit skimpy on bonus features, both the HD-DVD combo and regular DVD edition do have solid featurettes on the making of the film. The HD-DVD side of this combo flipper looks marvelous while the regular DVD side (which mirrors the single sided DVD in terms of its look)looks extremely good as well. The first "Secrets and Stories" focuses on how Cronenberg brought his unique sensibility to the material and "Marked for Life" focuses on the tattoos that play such a key role in the film. Both combined run under 20 minutes and it is very disappointing that Cronenberg did not supply a commentary track (I suspect when Oscar comes calling we will see a "Special Edition").<br /><br />"Eastern Promises" features rich and often stunning performances with Mortensen deftly handling his Russian accent and Watts tackling her British one with equal skill. "Eastern Promises" makes for a fascinating bookend with "No Country For Old Men" which has a very different story at its core but also focuses on unique characters deftly integrating them into a compelling plot.<br /><br />"Eastern Promises" might not be for everyone but the stunning performances, deft direction and well written script certainly deserve recognition when it comes to awards time. High recommended.</p></body></html>

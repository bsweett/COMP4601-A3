Their life has become routine and boring.  They've fallen out of love.<br /><br />What they don't know is that each of them has a secret.  In fact, it's the same secret.  Both of them are assassins who have been hiding what they really do from each other since the moment they met.  Their respective bosses have figured it out, however, and their next assignment is to kill each other, or become a target together.<br /><br />To be honest, I was intrigued by the premise, but really knew nothing else about the film.  I was almost turned off by the gossip surrounding the leads, but went with some friends to see it anyway.<br /><br />We loved it!  This is a black comedy with lots of action and suspense.  And great one-liners.  We laughed ourselves silly at the dialog from the very first scene.  The funniest scene by far was the scene where John and Jane were fighting around their house.  Their lines were exactly the opposite of what they were really feeling, but the actors did a great job of delivering the lines in a way that captured the absurdity of the situation.<br /><br />That's not to say the movie isn't without some flaws.  The beginning, while laying much needed background, is also a little slow.  And the climax is completely unbelievable.  Still, this isn't a movie to be taken seriously.  If you watch it looking for logic, you will be disappointed.  If you disengage your brain, you'll enjoy a fun time.<br /><br />The DVD features the standard stuff we've come to expect these days.  In addition to the movie, there are three audio commentaries with various members of the crew, including one with the director.  There are also some deleted scenes and a making of a scene featurette.<br /><br />Those looking for a logical, sophisticated action flick will be disappointed.  Those looking for a good time will be entertained.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you.</p></body></html>

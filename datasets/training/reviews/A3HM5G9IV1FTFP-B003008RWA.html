Whether or not you agree that America should adopt a universal health care program, I'm hoping that people like Moore bringing the topic into the mainstream will help perpetuate a dialogue about American health care, which, I think most people can agree, seems to be heading quickly to ruin.<br /><br />What the film does a good job of pointing out is that there seems to be a fundamental conflict between the health care profession, which is about healing and preventing illness, and the business world. Insurance companies make more money when they are able to find ways to deny people's claims. The result is the kind of horror stories that "Sicko" puts on display.</p></body></html>

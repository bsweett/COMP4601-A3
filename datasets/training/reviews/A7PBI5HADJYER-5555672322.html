<meta name="summary" content="Not one of the series' best."></head><body><p>Jason gets his hockey mask (and kills a bunch of teens in the woods)!  Plot-wise, that's the only thing differentiating it from the previous entries.  There's also the fact that the movie was filmed in 3-D, which explains why there's a lot of dangerous objects waved maniacally in front of the screen.  Not much in the way of suspense, and while Dana Kimmell and Catherine Parks are hot, neither get naked.  The last twenty minutes, a big stalk and chase sequence, is pretty good, however, and the movie's only real saving grace.  Better than part 2, but hardly the most enjoyable film of the series.</p></body></html>

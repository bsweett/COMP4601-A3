This movie is a lot of things and bad isn't one of them. It's unique, fun, exciting and original. It has a look of a 30's adventure pic which makes it different from other films these days. I wouldn't mind sequels but this film didn't exactly get the audience it deserved. So their probably won't be more movies and that's a shame.<br /><br />  Jude Law plays a pilot trying to save the world from giant robots. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his love interest who's a journalist. They both are well casted and even look like actors from the 30's in this. They have good chemestry too. Roeper knocked Angelina Jolie saying she's horrible as her daredevil pilot character. I've seen much worse performances though and she's not in the movie enough to ruin it in anyway even if she was bad in it.  Roeper knocks her a lot though. Guess she turned down a date with him or something lol. Roger Ebert was right though. This movie is about as exciting as watching Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time. Although it does run out of just a little steam before it is over but...just a little.</p></body></html>

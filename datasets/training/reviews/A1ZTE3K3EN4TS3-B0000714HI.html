There is just something about Dr. Evil's nerdy ways and affection for Mini Me that makes every moment they're onscreen great!  Unfortunately, Mike Myers has created so MANY characters for this series that most of them are now basically in walk-on roles!  Goldmember was an unnecessary character to create since he has maybe 15 minutes of honest-to-goodness screen time in the film - the rest of the time he's just an extra.  And he didn't do anything Dr. Evil couldn't have been written to do.  Robert Wagner and Frau whatever have a couple of lines each, but this show mostly belongs to Austin and Foxxy (whatever happened to Felicity Shagwell?  She doesn't even have a cameo in this one).  I read that they had 3 1/2 hours of material to sift through to make this movie, let's hope when the DVD comes out they give us most of that material as extras, because it just seems like there's so much we're missing here.  There are a couple of dead-on actors as the teen Austin and Dr. Evil that make me wish for more time in flashback here (those guys are GOOD!).  This is almost a remake of the last one: Austin goes back in time to fight a villian, Austin finds a sexy new partner and brings her back with him to the present, Dr. Evil and Mini Me do a musical number, there's the adult humor about various body parts throughout, Austin and Mini Me have a battle (though this one is 100 times funnier than the one in the last film), etc.  And with the way this one ends, it's obvious that Mike will have to create another new villian for the next one if the series is to progress (though it makes a fitting end as a trilogy) because the villian we're left with at the end just wouldn't be enough to carry a whole film (though it's a great idea).  And with the movie making so much money already, it's obvious there WILL be another installment at some point in the future.  Let's hope Dr. Evil and Mini Me return because the series won't be the same without them.  Oh, and as an added bonus to the series, in this movie we finally learn what Dr. Evil's first name is!</p></body></html>

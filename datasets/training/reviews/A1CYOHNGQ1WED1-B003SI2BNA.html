<meta name="summary" content="Good ending can't save a dull movie"></head><body><p>Jennifer Connelly plays a woman who is going through a bitter divorce and she and her young daughter must find a new place to live. They rent an apartment in a kind of dank, run-down building. There are continuous leaks of dark water from the apartment above and also strange noises. The daughter becomes obsessive over an imaginary friend that has something to do with the apartment upstairs. It turns out there was a little girl who lived there who disappeared a few weeks earlier and no one knows what happened to her. It all ties in with Connelly's issues with her own mother and she begins to wonder if she is going crazy. The water leaks are blamed on a few teenagers that live in the building and Connelly sees her husband talking to these boys. She wonders if he is paying them to mess with her to help in the custody fight.<br /><br />The movie does make you wonder if the things that are happening are supernatural or a set-up and it is a stylish movie to look at. The performances are also first-rate. However, the movie ultimately fails because except for last ten minutes, and one creepy scene in particular, there is no tension or fear. Things happen at a very slow pace and there isn't anything frightening about them for the viewer. The first hour and a half of the movie are dull and it does not build, it just sits there. I love the scene at the end when the daughter is in the bathtub and the mother finally realizes exactly what's happening but it's too little too late to save the movie as a whole.</p></body></html>

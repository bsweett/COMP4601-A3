Well, yes it is.  And I like both.  In the Claim, a retelling of Thomas Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge, you see MJ give a performance that should of at least netted her an academy award nomination (and she can sing!).  But the Academy, being the sink hole it now is, ignored that wonderful movie and the performances in it.  Fast forward things a few years, and Milla is kicking tail in better than Tomb Raider style.  A business decision on MJ's part?  Who knows?  But Hollywood can be cruel to women as they age.  For my money, it's clear MJ can do anything, and if B-movie Superchick is her choice, then enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Apocalypse is the kind of movie that critics hate, and movie goers love.  It's fast, it's furious, and don't try to make much sense of it (Example: the motorcycle crashing through the church window.  But hey!  It LOOKED great!).  Devil dogs, zombies (very lame ones, who fail the Romero zombie shuffle test), evil corporate scientists, and a band of heros out to save a little girl.  That's all you probably need to know.  This particular chapter of the RE series is probably closer than the original as far as aping the game, with various moments in various rooms where something hideous awaits.  As genre work, this movie is pretty good, with one star missing due to zombies being used as only background noise. Check it out!</p></body></html>

I know his works are loose ensemble pieces where plot is secondary to character and immediacy and spontaneity.  Still, although I desperately wanted to love this adaptation of the wonderfully warm Garrison Keillor radio program, it ultimately didn't work.  --But I'd still recommend you see it.  I just wouldn't make it a top priority.<br /><br />This is basically a photographed version of the radio show, with one added element: this is the final broadcast before the station is sold to an evil "hatchet man" who plans on tearing down the place and erecting a parking lot.  (This is how you know it's a movie: in real life when they tear down old buildings, they never erect parking lots; that would be too smart and practical.  Instead it's usually a strip mall or a 50-screen cinaplex, sans parking.)  So the old gang gathers for one last night of music and mayhem, as Garrison's old acts do the routines they've been doing for 30 years.<br /><br />In the movie, most of the acts are played by actors rather than the actual people who do the radio show.  And here's the remarkable thing about the movie: these actors do the acts as though they *have* been doing them for 30 years.  Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin play singing sisters with such perfect timing and a feel for one another that you have to hear and see them to believe it.  I for one am not a big fan of country music, but after seeing this movie, I'd buy a country album if Meryl recorded it.  Also, John C. Reilly and Woody Harrelson are a blast as a pair of raunchy cowboys, Dusty and Lefty.  You'd expect Harrelson to shine the most here, but honestly it's the ever-reliable Reilly who steals the show, without appearing to even try.  Both seem to be pretty fair guitar players too.  Their song "Bad Jokes" will make you laugh out loud.<br /><br />But the real surprise among the performers is Lindsay Lohan.  Her role is not huge, but she's got a certain chemistry with Meryl Streep, who plays her mother, and there is something about her singing "Frankie and Johnny" (with her own twisted ad-libbed lyrics) that is hilarious.  I can't explain exactly why, or why it wouldn't be funny if it were someone else.  You'll just have to see it.  Kudos for Altman for recognizing something delightfully quirky in Lohan and bringing it out.<br /><br />The plots that revolve *around* the show don't work so well.  One of my favorite actors, Kevin Kline, plays a sort of noirish detective who tells the story.  I understand his character is talked about in the real radio show and is here given flesh and blood to move the story along, but I'm not sure how well this works.  Ditto for Virginia Madsen, who plays a sort of "angel of death" who hovers over the cast and calls some of them home during the show.  (Of course, that's how I want to die, staring at Virginia Madsen's pouty lips.)  I'm not sure what to make of this part or this plotline.  I like Madsen, but she does little here besides walk around wearing a white trench coat.  Tommy Lee Jones is fine as the "axe man," but he's also just being standard issue Tommy Lee Jones with gruff voice and no-nonsense mannerisms--does he even have to *act* to play a role like this.  I kept expecting a revelation from him, some kind of higher purpose for him showing up in the last 20 minutes, but it didn't come.<br /><br />And the ending.  It's just bizarre.  The problem with ensemble-type stories like this is they are tough to end.  They aren't linear and rely more on atmosphere than plot; modualar in construction, they can go on forever.  The last scene here felt totally arbitrary and didn't leave me feeling fulfilled.  And I don't get the point of the transformation of  Lohan's character--except possibly to say that old fashioned values are being replaced by cold, calculating yuppiedom, which is kind of shallow.  The final appearance of Madsen's character also felt wrong.<br /><br />The music is sweet, however, and the performances within the show are flawless.  I haven't mentioned Keillor himself because he basically playes himself.  His most interesting bit is his scene where he refuses to acknowledge this is the last show.  His attitude is interesting, but we don't go any further with this character information.  Similar it's revealed that he and Streep used to be married, and are still obviously very close, yet again this is background that is presented but not really used after that.  Something about the story--performances aside--felt half-baked, like this were a draft more than a finished script.<br /><br />The transfer to DVD is excellent, the sound is superb, and the accompanying "making of" documentary is fun to watch.  The trailer makes the film appear to have more coherency than it does.  This won't go down as top-drawyer Altman, or even close.  He relies too much on how good Keillor and company are.  They are good, but we know that from years of listening to his radio show.  The movie, as gentle and sweet as it is, almost seems unnecessary--it adds nothing to A Prairie Home Companion.  The three stars are mostly for the artistry of the performances, not for Robert Altman's contributions.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I'm takin' 'em ALL back!"></head><body><p>Well, gee-whiz! Looks like I'm not the only one who waxes nostalgic about this flick! Of course, having grown up in the 80s, gettin' sentimental over The Goonies  is pretty much a given. How can any self-respecting Gen-Xer NOT be taken back whenever he/she watches this bad-boy? Yeah, see what I mean? Heck, I even remember re-enacting my fave Goonies  moments with the few friends I had way back when. I was always stuck with havin' to play 'Chunk' for obvious reasons (I still do today!) but that's cool, 'cuz he had the best lines anyway! Now I'll admit that doin' the Truffle-Shuffle was sorta lame. But the guy you really hadda feel for was the one who was picked to play Sloth !<br /><br />All right, enough nostalgia now; time for me to break out a proper review. Now if you're lookin' for a synopsis of the flick, take a look at the top of the item page. That having been said, I'm goin' to comment on the picture quality (pretty good, but not quite tops compared to other DVDs in the Warner Bros.  catalogue) and sound quality (above-average; but like the picture quality, Warner  has done better with their other video discs).<p>Now it's on to the special features, of which there are a decent amount. To me the most notable extra feature is the commentary audio track, featuring director Richard Donner and the six Goonies  adventurers, all grown up! Just about everybody throws in an anecdote or two as the flick plays on, except for 'Data ', who had to be prodded into talking by the others on occasion. Sean 'Mikey ' Astin throws in his two cents every once in a while for about the first forty minutes, then mysteriously disappears for the rest of the presentation. And Corey 'Mouth ' Feldman spends quite a few moments takin' shots from his castmates regarding his character's VERY 80s fashion tastes, which included parachute pants and a Prince  Purple Rain  T-shirt!<p>Then there's the behind-the-scenes mini-doc featuring Donner getting things going with the kids, and Executive Producer Steven Spielberg throwing in a few comments about the flick and how it relates to his childhood memories of old-time adventure flicks and stuff. Also of note are the outtakes. The showcase cutting-room scrap: a scene at the local convenience store featuring the fab four of Mikey , Mouth , Data , and Chunk . Personally, I felt this particular bit should've been restored to the movie itself, but then again, it's probably best that they left well enough alone. The rest of the excised snippets include a giant octopus attack in the hidden pirate cove, and a few scene extensions.<p>Last-- and least-- is the two-part Cyndi Lauper Goonies 'R' Good Enough video, which has to be one of the weirdest and dumbest music videos ever produced. It's basically a fifteen-minute-long mini-movie featuring Cyndi going on her very own Goonies -style adventure, with a few of the mo-pic's principals and a lotta WWF stars roundin' out the cast. If you ever thought that Captain Lou Albano, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Classy Freddy Blassie, or Andre The Giant had no acting ability, this unfortunate little ditty-drama will prove you right!<p>Now if only Warner would put their discs in PLASTIC keep cases instead of cardboard, this bad-boy would be near-perfect!<p>'Late</p></body></html>

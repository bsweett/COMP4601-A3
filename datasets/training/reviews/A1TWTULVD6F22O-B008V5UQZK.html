<meta name="summary" content="5 Stars Because It's Delightful!"></head><body><p>Sure, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" is not a cinematic event...the plot has virtually no serious conflict, and the movie is really a series of gags built on one delightful theme...the craziness of ethnic families, proud of their heritage.<p>Rita Wilson, with help from husband Tom Hanks, engineered the making of this film.  From a biographical original screenplay by Nia Vardalos, who plays herself in the film, as Toulah, the ugly duckling daughter of a boisterous Greek family, Wilson got the film made with an original limited release to only a few screens in major cities.  Audience reaction caused the studio to think again, and remarket it to all theaters.  MBFGW will be one of the few films that survives the whole summer on the big screen.<p>Vardalos has crafted a plot and sight and sound gags that keep you chuckling throughout the film.  Add to the mix John Corbett, every woman in America's dream man since he played Aidan in "Sex and the City", and you've got a winner.<p>I was exceptionally happy to see the wonderful Michael Constantine and Laine Kazan, small screen performers of old, in terrific new roles, and terrifically funny!  Andrea Martin - the zany alumnus of Saturday Night Live, gets lots of laughs as the crazy aunt.  My favorite site gag in the movie, however, is the repetitive shots of the front of Toulah's home, complete with carefully placed Greek statuary.<p>There've not been many quirky, feel good films to rival MBFGW in recent years.  Go see it and celebrate your own crazy family!</p></body></html>

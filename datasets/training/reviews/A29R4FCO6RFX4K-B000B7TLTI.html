<meta name="summary" content="Incredibles sees Pixar back on form"></head><body><p>After a couple of by-the-numbers offerings from PIXAR, THE INCREDIBLES shows that the standard formula can be thrown out the window and still make a great movie. What makes a true hero? Is it his or her talents and abilities (in this case, the ability to knock down buildings or stretch like a rubber band or run super-fast)? Or is it something more subtle, something in the spirit, the courage to face up to one's foibles and weaknesses and overcome them and in doing so, make the world a better place. Is it better to celebrate mediocrity, the concept that everyone is "special", or should we not celebrate the exceptional ones among us, uplift them and admire them for their special contributions to the world? If you are a thoughtful person, this movie will leave you asking these questions. It will also leave you laughing, the dialogue is hilarious, the characters realistic and believable. The romance-obsessed teenager, the mischievous little boy, the housewife who is suppressing her true heroic nature, and the husband withering away in a cube farm--these are people you meet every day, and you might be one of them. This is a brilliant example of perfect movie-making. Buy the DVD today!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="RESIDENT EVIL Makes Good Halloween Fun"></head><body><p>Ravenous zombies - what more could you ask for on Halloween?  RESIDENT EVIL is chock full of monsters, blood, gore, and actually cool, creative decapitations.  Based on a popular computer game (which I have never played), RESIDENT EVIL is an entertaining monster flick for a cozy evening at home.<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL opens with a bang:  something has gone seriously wrong in a secret, underground research facility.  (Isn't that always the case?)  Red Queen, the computer that runs the complex, has gone mad, killing everyone in the place, and initiating a complete lock-down of the facility.  The only people on the outside who might know what is going on have no memory.  A crack military team is sent in to determine what happened.  But things go horribly wrong...<br /><br />As zombie movies go, RESIDENT EVIL is pretty fun.  It launches the viewer on a wild ride, rarely pausing for breath.  The special effects are pretty well done, and as stated earlier, there are some pretty original decapitations using lasers.  The plot is pretty loose and full of holes, but I really didn't care; I was having too much fun.  The acting is typical for a monster flick, but then again, you don't watch a monster movie for the acting.<br /><br />If you enjoy this sort of thing, you will really like RESIDENT EVIL.  My husband and I did, and it was just the thing for Halloween.  But seriously, couldn't the Umbrella Corporation, who owns the research facility, see this coming?  I mean, they named their master computer Red Queen.  It was in the cards.  Eventually, the Red Queen was obviously going to say "Off with their heads!"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Don't Miss this One!"></head><body><p>Not being a big Robert Downey Jr. fan, I thought this movie would be bad.  On the contrary.  This is the role that Downey Jr. was born to play!  The movie is not only good it is one of the best action films to come out in years!  Everybody cast was perfect from Terrance Howard as Tony Stark's military friend, to Gwyneth Paltrow as a very sexy version of Pepper Potts (Stark's fawning and overprotective Administrative Assistant).<br /><br />Stark is a wild playboy genius who reminds me of the Mozart character in Amadeus.  After being almost killed by a mine explosion from one of his own company's weapons, Stark becomes a changed man who is more interested in saving the world than creating weapons.  Unfortunately his evil partner and mentor, Obadiah Stane has other ideas.<br /><br />The action is great and Iron Man's suit is very believable.  It is amazing to see Stark dressed by robot helpers and to see how the armor goes on.<br /><br />Warning - Make sure you stay past the end of the credits or you will miss an important few minutes of added story that will set up the movie continuation and also introduce a familiar face.</p></body></html>

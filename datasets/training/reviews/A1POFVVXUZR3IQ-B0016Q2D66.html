Frankly, "Revolutionary Road" is a depressing movie from start to finish. The story centers on Frank and April Wheeler, a nice couple residing in suburban CT and apparently living the American dream, not. April [Kate Winslet in a gut-wrenching performance] is a stifled personality, feeling neither joy or fulfillment in raising her two kids or in her marriage. She wishes to break free from the confines of suburbia and all that it entails, and hits upon a plan - get Frank [Leo Caprio] to give up his humdrum job, pack the family up and move to France, where she is convinced that she can earn a good living as a secretary [she keeps harping on the fact that secretaries get paid really well in Europe] whilst Frank figures out what he really wants to do.<br /><br />This is a movie about two truly lost souls - both Frank and April aren't really sure what they want, and just feel that they're missing something, which is undefined. As a viewer, it was hard for me to connect emotionally with either character, and more so April than Frank. April is a character that is so consumed by misery that she literally sets herself on a self-destructive path, but it is hard to understand why this seemingly intelligent, beautiful woman can be so unhappy. She has two lovely children whom she doesn't spend much time with [throughout the movie, the kids are either sporadically present or not at all], she takes no pleasure in her beautiful home or surroundings, she chafes in social situations [like there's someplace better she'd rather be] and just appears miserable throughout the movie [except instances where she's packing up, hoping to leave for that beacon of light, Paris]. The only thing I could come up with was that April was clinically depressed, but even then, no one reaches out to her, especially her husband. This is never touched upon in the movie [perhaps because such things were not acknowledged back in the 50s?].<br /><br />Besides the themes of an unhappy marriage and unfulfilled lives, there are other underlying themes here such as mental illness [Michael Shannon in a remarkably illuminating supporting role], abortion [back when such procedures were illegal, leading to some tragic actions and consequences], adultery, and depression. Given such dark themes, it was inevitable that "Revolutionary Road" would be such a depressing watch.<br /><br />I loved the acting - both Kate Winslet and Leo de Caprio shine in their tormented roles, as does Michael Shannon as the mentally unbalanced mathematician with much foresight. But given how disconnected I felt to the characters being portrayed, I can only give this movie 3* at best. Only recommended to those who can stomach a dark ride into the human soul.</p></body></html>

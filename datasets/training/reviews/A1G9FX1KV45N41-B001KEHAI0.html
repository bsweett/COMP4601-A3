<meta name="summary" content="What vain weathercocks are we..."></head><body><p>When I first saw this movie, I could only think that it was incredibly stupid, but the second time, I saw that there is a very important message.<br />As the vain, conceited, ill-tempered and mean spirited weatherman, Phil Connors (played by Bill Murray) is forced to live each life day after day, in a type of private hell, we see how there is a spiritual message here.<br />We are all here to learn lessons and our dilemmas will continue to be repeated until we rectify our mistakes.<br />In a sense the same theme as the Scrooge story. Bill Murray was also superb in `Scrooged'!<br />A superb performance by Andie McDowell as the movie's leading lady.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Loved It"></head><body><p>I knewI would like the last installment in the Rocky franchise, but Rocky Balboa was even better than expected.  Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Rocky Balboa is about sixty.  He owns a popular Italian restaurant.  Despite his Philly icon status, he lives a quiet, humble life, driving an old van and keeping a folding chair in a tree by Adrian's grave.  Honoring Adrian, he has never married and has no girlfriend.  Their son, in a corporate job, avoids his awkward attempts at fathering. To top it all off Rocky is facing his last fight, with a much younger opponent.  Why is he doing it?  "There's a beast in me," he sadly tells Paulie.<br /><br />The movie has a great message, is tender, and you root for and relate to the Italian Stallion all the way.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

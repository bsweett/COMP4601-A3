<meta name="summary" content="The Black Dahlia; Very Beautiful Mess (And This Is Not a Compliment)"></head><body><p>For any filmgoers who remember the brilliant works of Brian De Palma back in the 70s and 80s, `The Black Dahlia' a crime novel inspired by true case of a horrible murder of Elizabeth Short in 1947, should have been great opportunity for the maestro to come back. Unfortunately, he misses it, and though you can still enjoy his signature bravura camera, like its frequent vertical movement, you feel he has lost touch.<br /><br />Many people would find the story of `The Black Dahlia' very complicated, but that really doesn't bother me as far as it constantly offers something intriguing. While watching the first 30 minutes of `The Black Dahlia,' my first and only impression was boredom. We meet two cops Bucky (Josh Hartnett) and Lee (Aaron Eckhart); we see their boxing match, we are informed that they are called `Mr. Ice' and `Mr. Fire', and so on. Frankly, we don't care, and the film seems not to care either.<br /><br />The mutilated body of Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner) is found, but as the investigation goes on, the situation surrounding her death gets far more sinister than her dead body suggested at first. Unfortunately, these lurid aspects of the story seem not to have been treated with enough attention from the actors or director, who failed to understand that obsession of these characters for the darker side of humans (represented by stag film, for example) is exactly the point of James Ellroy or any noir films. Bucky gets involved with three ladies, all doomed in different ways - Kay (Scarlett Johansson) marked with B.D., Madeline (Hilary Swank) daughter of rich family, and of course, Elizabeth - but the portrait of the detective is not credible enough, failing to convince us of his intense emotions.<br /><br />Same thing can be said about Lee trying to hide something from his partner and us, something very important as to which we are not given enough clues, and which Brian De Palma suddenly starts to explain hurriedly in the last 20 minutes. By the time you fully grasp what is going on here, the film is almost over, leaving us far behind. `L. A. Confidential' (based on Ellroy's novel) has also a fairly complicated story, but it never leaves us behind. Its intense characters, all obsessed for something dark, grab your heart from the very beginning.<br /><br />However, you don't see such driving force in the so-so acting of the entire cast of `The Black Dahlia' except Mia Kirshner playing the titular character. What was impressive in other noirs like `Laura' turns into something (unwittingly) silly and campy. We must see boxer-turned-cop Bucky is fatally attracted to the gorgeous ladies both miscast, and Fiona Shaw gives us one of the most embarrassing acting in this decade. Is her overacting really intentional? If so, what's the intention?<br /><br />Thankfully we have atmospheric photography of Vilmos Zsigmond, superb costume design of Jenny Beavan, and first-rate production design of Dante Ferretti. But for all their fine works, all I can say about `The Black Dahlia' is `mess.' Beautiful, but still a mess.</p></body></html>

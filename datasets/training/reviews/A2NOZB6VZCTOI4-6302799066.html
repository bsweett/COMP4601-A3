The film is the standout satire from the 1960's and possibly of all time. The film is unbelievably tightly edited and is probably Kubrick's greatest work. The single largest contribution to the success of the film is the superior casting, led by Peter Sellers in a virtuoso triple performance. Supporting Sellers are Sterling Hayden, who plays the best dark lunatic ever on film, and the brilliant George C. Scott, as General Buck Turgidson. My favorite of the smaller roles has to be that of the rather dense Colonel 'Bat' Guano, played so effectively by Keenan Wynn. Also contributing to the realism of the film were the brilliant sets which are very effective at conveying the time period and mood.  <p>The DVD has several excellent extras, including a documentary on Kubrick, and a wonderful documentary on the making of 'Dr. Strangelove'. There are also some odd interviews, and typical features like biographies, trailers (a must see!), and subtitles. <p>This movie is one of the greatest films ever made, and I can't endorse it highly enough to anyone with an eye to black comedy and satire.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="2.35 STARS: Interesting premise, but a bit on the dull side from a horror movie fan's perspective."></head><body><p>"The Exorcism of Emily Rose" sounded like a dream come true to me when I first heard that it was coming out in theaters.  After all, what horror movie fan would not be interested in a movie about possession and an exorcism, especially a movie that was supposed to be based (at least in part) on a true story.<br /><br />The "Exorcism of Emily Rose" succeeds in sparking one's imagination regarding the philosophical debate between whether possession or mental illness is the cause of some of these mysterious types of frightening manifestations and unexplained phenomena that sometimes occur in various individuals.  From this standpoint, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is clearly a success.  From a horror movie's standpoint, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" comes up a bit short.  In all fairness, this movie should not even be classified exclusively as a horror movie notwithstanding the disturbing images in the movie.  These disturbing images, Emily's manifestations of possession or mental illness and the story's message itself are what carry this movie from a horror movie's perspective, but is it enough?  Most experienced horror movie fans would submit that it is not enough.  Does this mean we need more blood and gore in the movie?  Certainly not, but there just is not enough to this movie to sustain any real sense of horror and fear in the audience.  In fact, when compared to Friedkin's "The Exorcist" and "Amityville II: The Possession", "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is about as scary as the Bugs Bunny cartoons relatively speaking.  Of course, comparisons of "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" to Friedkin's "The Exorcist" are unfortunately inevitable.  However, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" clearly fails to hold up to scrutiny regarding the movie's ability to evoke unadulterated horror in the audience.<br /><br />Obviously, the courtroom scenes are an integral part of this movie, but this clearly takes away from the movie's ability to sustain horror in the audience.  Don't get me wrong as I love a good courtroom drama as much as the next person (as I am an attorney believe it or not), but the courtroom drama in this movie causes the movie to work against itself at least as far as this movie's merits as a horror movie are concerned.<br /><br />Overall, the acting, directing and production values in this movie are pretty good.  The story works fairly well, but the movie is clearly unable to sustain enough horror to satisfy the pure horror movie fan.  From a drama fan's perspective, this movie is great, but it just does not work as well as a horror movie.<br /><br />Perhaps, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" would best be described as a hybrid or quasi Drama-Horror movie.  Still, with that being said, Emily's screaming is not quite enough to instill the viewer with unadulterated horror.  The disturbing images that Emily sees are quite effective, and the one scene where Emily's body is completely contorted is very effective and probably the scariest scene in the movie, but is it enough to satisfy the horror movie fan?  I would argue that it is not.<br /><br />Still, with that being said, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is, all things considered, an effective thought-provoking drama-horror hybrid movie, but if you are expecting a pure horror movie, you will be as disappointed as I was, and you will definitely find parts of this movie dull and boring.  Nevertheless, you could do a lot worse than to watch "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" as it is quite a thought-provoking movie, but just DO NOT compare this movie to the horror movie classic "The Exorcist" because if you do, you will be sorely disappointed.  Overall, I would consider "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" to be an average movie...thus the TWO stars rating with my biggest criticism simply being that there was not enough to this movie to make it into a good solid horror movie.</p></body></html>

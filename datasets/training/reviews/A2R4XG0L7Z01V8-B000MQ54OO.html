If you're older, skip this and watch March Of The Penguins instead. This is pretty much a happier version.<br /><br />As I quite often mention in reviews of animations, these days it's more spot the famous voice, than actually paying that much attention to the film. Here, we have Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, a poor effort by Robin Williams, and Brittany Murphy. But in this, it's also a case of spot the song used. Yes, there are some full songs used, but there's also a couple where just a line or two is used. How many did you spot? I managed to spot all of these:<br /><br />Somebody To Love (bad vocal from Brittany)<br />My Way<br />Kiss (Nicole Kidman doing her Marilyn Monroe impersonation)<br />Boogie Wonderland<br />I Only Have Eyes For You<br />Unchained Melody<br />Hello<br />Let's Talk About Sex<br />Heartbreak Hotel (when's Hugh Jackman releasing an album?)<br />Chantilly Lace<br />I'll Make Love To You<br />Shake Your Bon-Bon<br />If You Leave Me Now<br />Baby Got Back<br />Leader Of The Pack<br /><br />Quite a handful yes?<br /><br />The also problem I have is that many animations these days, with talking animals, are all "animals vs humans", which is getting a little bit tired. But at least there's no drug references in this, like some older Disney movies. It's also too long for a kids film, and I was getting antsy watching it, so I guess any kid will be totally bored and annoying their parents by some point.<br /><br />The film also throws across a very strong political message, about global warming, humans wrecking the environment and animals suffering. Is that really what you want in a kids movie? I know very old Disney shorts were very pro-war but in this day and age, it's not really appropriate. I recently bought the two Ice Age movies, I wonder what message I'm going to get that I'm old enough to understand.<br /><br />It may be a cute movie, but if you've already seen March Of The Penguins, you will notice a few similarities. And the whole scene where the penguin is being batted about by a whale's tail - hello, if that was real, the penguin would have all its bones broken, and would be dead. It's a whale's TAIL. Ouch!<br /><br />I was expecting this to be a nice happy Easter movie, as it was released in time for it, but was disappointed once again, by an animation film. When are they going to release all their fancy motion capture and CGI aren't going to save a movie?</p></body></html>

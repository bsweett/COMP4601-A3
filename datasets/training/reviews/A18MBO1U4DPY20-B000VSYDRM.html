<meta name="summary" content="Some Audacity, Brilliant Film-Making"></head><body><p>I had no idea what this film was about. I was absolutely stunned by the acting, the storyline, the direction, the background music and even Dustin Hoffman's little cameo. This film is about 150 minutes and yet is worth every bit of it. I would compare this film with greats like Prestige, Passion of the Christ, Amadeus and maybe even American Beauty. I compare it with Amadeus because of the setting, the extraordinary sets, with Prestige because of how effective and tactful the film-making is - unpredictable. Why I compare it with Passion of the Christ and maybe even Apocalypto because of the crime & punishment factor. It is American Beautyish because the central character goes through certain varied self-absorbed emotions to get what he wants. And then the character sees nothing but he wants and what he must do both in and out of order.<br /><br />I do not know why people didn't like the film. I'm happy some didn't get it. I am now looking forward to reading the book. I will not bother recommending this film to people who I think won't like it, simply because this is a film only to be appreciated by someone worthy of understanding it's craft and poignance. I loved the first one hour, hardly any dialogues, the film was amazingly easy to follow. The last thirty minutes had me so gripped that I felt a bit emotional out of the sheery beauty the central character brings out.<br /><br />The Perfume is a film about survival, faith and hobby. Three cheers and much respect for the makers.</p></body></html>

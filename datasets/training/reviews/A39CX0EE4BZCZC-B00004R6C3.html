<meta name="summary" content="If You Liked 'Alien,' You'll Like This"></head><body><p>This intense sci-fi film is almost horror in nature, a la "Alien" as it features a tremendous amount of suspense. In fact, if you liked "Alien," you'll probably like this, the main difference of the two films being the different setting and a different cast.<br /><br />The cast may be different but the characters are the same: scientists-heroes who are all profane low-life-types who you would never see in professions and positions like this. Only in the world of film do you see sleazy people like this in high-tech intelligent positions such as astronauts or scientists. Who better to exemplify this in the 1980s than self-proclaimed macho man Kurt Russell?<br /><br />Back to the positives: besides the great suspense, the story is an involving one that hooks you in fairly early and never lets go. I have a widescreen VHS copy which looks nice, too, since the visuals definitely warranted a widescreen viewing experience. I suspect a Blu-Ray verson of this would really look great.</p></body></html>

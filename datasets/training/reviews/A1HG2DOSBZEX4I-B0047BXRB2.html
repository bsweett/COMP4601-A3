<meta name="summary" content="One of the Most Influential Films Ever Made"></head><body><p>In 1956 MGM released Fred Wilcox's Forbidden Planet. Originally conceived as a B-movie the film has taken on a personality and a cult status that brands it as one of the most unique American films made. The film has been the inspiration for Star Wars and Star Trek and just about every modern space opera references it.<br /><br />The story is not a simple one and a great deal of Cyril Hume's screenplay is exposition that manages to take somewhat complex themes and make them accessible to a Saturday afternoon audience. A space cruiser piloted by Commander J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen) lands on the planet Altair 4 and meets the mysterious  Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira ( Anne Francis). Morbius is studying the artifacts of a strange civilization called the Krells. The Krell civilization was incredibily advanced. It had wiped out war, disease and had explored the universe 2000 centuries ago before it was itself wiped out.<br /><br />The story is a reworking of Shakespeare's The Tempest and the story hold up quite well after 52 years. The special effects were amazing for the time period and the matte paintings used for the backgrounds still look fantastic. The film was nominated for the 1957 Oscar for best special effects.<br /><br />If there is a problem with Forbidden Planet it is that the story of Monsters of the Id is somewhat dated. The film needs to be seen for the special effects production that it was. It does not need to be analysed for its story telling ability.<br /><br />The edition I viewed was the single disc  released by Warner Brothers. There have been at least two editions released since mine came out and I understand are much more complete. The picture, while not perfect, is quite good. There are scratches and abundant markings for reel changes and the like but they do not really mar the viewing experience. The sound is a standard mono mix but is easy to understand. The disc does not feature any special features other than the trailer. The trailer features a floating yellow scroll that was duplicated to great effect in the Star Wars movies.<br /><br />Get yourself some popcorn pop this one in and enjoy the golden age of sci-fi moviemaking.</p></body></html>

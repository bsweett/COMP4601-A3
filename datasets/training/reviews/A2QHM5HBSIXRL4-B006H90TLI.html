<meta name="summary" content="Bardem and Brolin are the standouts in this adaption of Cormac McCarthy's work"></head><body><p>I had read Cormac McCarthy's book upon its original paperback release.  Like many, I looked forward to the movie...especially after learning that long-time personal favorite Javier Bardem would play Anton Chigurh.  He didn't disappoint.  I thought both he and Josh Brolin were outstanding.  And, no doubt Ed Tom Bell could have been written with Tommy Lee Jones and his now-patented world-weariness in mind.<br /><br />The Coen Brothers' adaptation excels in clarifying some of the narrative of McCarthy's work.  The writer's prose is so terse at times that I had trouble following who was providing what side of a conversation.  The movie also firmly sets the action in the early 80s, thanks to cars, clothes and Bardem's god-awful haircut.  Also, the staging of the aftermath of the bloodbath in the desert is brilliant.  It captures the bleak, spooky, riveting and ultimately fateful nature of Llewelyn Moss's (Brolin) chance discovery in the desolate outskirts of a small west Texas town (hello, Marfa, TX!).<br /><br />All that aside, I enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00121QGPY">Michael Clayton (Widescreen Edition)</a> even more.  I thought it was the best thing I saw in 2007.  So, I gave that directorial debut from Tony Gilroy five stars and 'No Country' gets four here.</p></body></html>

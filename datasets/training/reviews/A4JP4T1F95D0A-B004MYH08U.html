Tremendously talented cast is really wasted in this film.  I am going to have to lay the blame on Seth Rogen for this one.  As much as I like a lot of his other work, this film wasn't good.  The writing(by Seth) was not great, it went back and forth between comedy, action and thriller and failed on almost all levels.  There were some good ideas, but they never really played out in full.  The casting of Rogen as the hero was not good either.  He is in much better shape, but his acting skills just didn't work for this kind of film.  I never really believed in him.  I would say to give this a try when it comes on cable if you like some interesting action, but for the most part don't bother buying this.</p></body></html>

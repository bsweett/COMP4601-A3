True Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus are interesting, but the heart of Matrix fandom lies with the intricate philosphical constructs the films created. Matrix Reloaded had philosphical elements, which kept audience interest despite the film's weak plot line. Revolutions, on the other hand, is a pure sci-fi action flick. It asks us to care about the supporting characters in Zion, when we really don't know them that well. As a result the film is a visual feast of impressive special effects, but it feels very empty in the middle.<br /><br />What also hurt is that Revolutions splits up the lead characters, with Morpheus given little to do than play co-pilot for the finale. Potentially interesting characters like Persephone and the Merovingian disappear early on in the first act. And Agent Smith becomes the end boss for the movie because movies like these need end bosses.<br /><br />There are two dvd editions available; this 2-disc set, and a huge Matrix collection that contains all the films and bucketloads of bonus material. The bonus material on this set is already pretty decent. If you're not a huge fan but still want to own the movies, this set will fit your collection well.<br /><br />Not exactly how the Matrix should've ended, but still a good popcorn flick when you're bored.</p></body></html>

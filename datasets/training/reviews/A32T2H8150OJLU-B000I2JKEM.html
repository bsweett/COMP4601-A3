<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly good"></head><body><p>My older children (aged 20 and 18) have been raving about Tim Burton's movies for years, and somehow it's taken me this long to get around to watching a couple.  This week I watched this film and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN694K">Alice in Wonderland</a>.  Though the general darkness of the film is not an environment I typically seek out, I learned that Burton uses the overall darkness and dreariness in his films' imagery to build his story to its unexpected conclusion.<br /><br />The stop-motion animation (at least that is what it looks like) was well done.  The scenery and trees, etc., are classic Burton.  I actually felt for both of the brides and the groom in this twisted tale of wishes, dreams, and love lost and love found.<br /><br />I won't spill the beans, but if you are like me, you will greatly enjoy the exciting conclusion to this dark tale.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie to viewers probably aged 10+.  Younger children may have nightmares, though the movie is not particularly scary over all.<br /><br />All in all I'd say that I liked this film a lot, but did not "love it."<br /><br />A solid 4-star offering for me.</p></body></html>

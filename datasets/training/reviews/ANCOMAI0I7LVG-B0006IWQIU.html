Seriously, did anyone see that coming?  I was blown away, and I actually almost boycotted seeing the thing, but then again, who am I to judge before actually seeing the finished product.  After watching it I can say that it is a very weak attempt to capitalize on geeky fanboyism, and it's a shame because a lot of people were willing to shell out hard-earned (or at least their parents hard-earned) money to see two of the most iconic creatures in sci-fi history duke it out on the big screen.<br /><br />Am I the only one who was bothered by the fact that there was like ONE Predator in this entire movie?<br /><br />The film has its fair share of deliciously claustrophobic sets, and so I'll throw credit where credit is due.  It serves up some nicely manipulated chills and there are some jumpy moments and even some surprisingly edgy violent moments considering the rating (which is only one of the films hindrances) but overall the film cannot get out of its own way.  The script offers some interesting connective tissue when concerning the relationship between the two species of alien, but it also seems to dumb down nearly everything else until it becomes just another generic science fiction movie.<br /><br />Run of the mill.<br /><br />I will say this; I'm thankful that this film stars the magnificent Sanaa Lathan.  I seriously adore her in everything she does and will watch her in anything, even this half-baked creation.  She is just perfection on the screen.  Even while meandering through this films murky waters, she manages to make her presence believable and engaging.  If a lesser actress had been cast, this film would have fallen apart rapidly (see `The Ruins' for an example of poor acting destroying a mediocre film).<br /><br />While I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this movie (in fact, I refuse to recommend it since it really doesn't need to be seen) I will say that if you happen to stumble onto it you won't be completely devastated.  It has some things going for it.  It's not a horribly bad movie, it's just a big disappointment.  Knowing what this movie could have been makes the experience so much less than rewarding.</p></body></html>

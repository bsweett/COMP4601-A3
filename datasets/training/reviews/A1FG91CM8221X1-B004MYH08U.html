Wouldn't it be COOL to have a superhero movie written and produced by that guy from "Knocked Up," and he's also the star, and he's the same jerky guy he was in "Knocked Up" plus he has this humongous sense of entitlement that comes from his being a billionaire from birth?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />Oh, come ON, man, "The Green Hornet" rocks! Seth Rogen plays a real bully, which is cool because bullies are cool, and they have all these great explosions and car crashes and megadeaths that look like Michel Gondry brought Michael Bay in to direct for him, and Cameron Diaz is really, really mean in this but she's really, really sexy too so we're supposed to root for her as the heroine, and you gotta laugh at those idiots Christoph Waltz and Tom Wilkinson because they actually try to give (chuckle) PERFORMANCES! "The Green Hornet" is everything a movie SHOULD be, man! Just explosions and car crashes and a hero who really lords it over everybody! You GOTTA love it, man! You BETTER love it! You better love it or I'll STING you! BUZZ! BUZZZ! BUZZZZZ...<br /><br />SWAT!</p></body></html>

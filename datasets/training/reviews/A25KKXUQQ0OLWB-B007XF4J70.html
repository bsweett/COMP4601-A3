<meta name="summary" content="Lovely Movie, Lovely Two Disk Collection"></head><body><p>One of the great movies!  I have loved this film since I was young and have seen it many times. I know most of the lines and the shots of the movie.  Can't get much better than this.  I bought the 2 disk version for the extras.  Robert Ebert does a beautiful job in commentary and should do them more often.  Many of the extras are well worth watching.  As for the film, Bogart, Bergman and Henreid were never better.  Claude Rains is great also.  What a dream movie!</p></body></html>

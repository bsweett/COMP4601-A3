<meta name="summary" content="A Classic Reborn"></head><body><p>Close Encounters is thirty years old and can be considered a classic among cinema fanatics.  The movie was released when special effects were in their infancy.  Movies like Star Wars had just come out and the idea of bringing UFO's to life was becoming possible.  Now thirty years later movies like this seem very simple.  Although the story never grows old and now in hi-def it is well worth another look.<br /><br />From the minute I got my hands on this set I realized how nice it actually is.  Containing just two discs but hours worth of features.  The first disc contains the movies in three different editions.  The Original Theatrical Version contains the movie how it was originally seen on the big screen.  Special Edition is the same version that was released several years ago with a few additional features that was added to the Theatrical Version.  The Director's Cut contains additional parts of the movie that were Steven Spielberg intended to be in his movie.  For all of you confused don't worry the set comes with a high quality glossy timeline sheet with the extra parts that were added to each edition.  On this disc you are also given an option to run the movie with all the extras.  So essentially you have four versions of this film.<br /><br />When I started watching this movie I was in awe.  This was one of the best hd transfers of a movie I have ever seen.  I have watched numerous movies over ten years old and this one looked best.  The color and visuals looked superb.  The sound is superb and the way it was intended to sound.<br /><br />For those of you who have never seen the movie it involves several characters.  A group of scientists are researching strange discoveries that are taking place like a fleet of WWII planes that went missing thirty years prior.  The discoveries are just the beginning as UFO's begin to make appearances all over the world.  Richard Dreyfuss is one of the people who witnesses the UFO activity and from that point his life is changed.  Trying to discover what the meaning of this is.  Of course in the meantime his family and work life are completely disrupted.  Although this is just the beginning of this mysterious journey.<br /><br />Close Encounters is a magical movie to say the least.  The story is timeless and has been copied for many years without the same success.  The special effects have improved greatly over the years but movie still remains a classic.  Now on Blu-ray this movie gives people a whole new reason to own it.  The extras make it well worth it.  This is a beautiful collection that should be added to any movie fan.</p></body></html>

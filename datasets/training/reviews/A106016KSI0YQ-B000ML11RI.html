Rodriguez formulates his cinematographic vision so carefully to the stunning black-and-white designs of Miller's stories that the live-action shots at times suggest exceptional animation, particularly in the film's early visual highpoints, a series of physical hand-to-hand battles between the hulking avenger Marv (Mickey Rourke) and the preppy ninja/serial killer Kevin (Elijah Wood) in a rainy midnight farmscape. Miller even advised the actors on their parts and took such a hand in the filming that Rodriguez wanted to give Miller sole directing credit when the Directors' Guild of America refused to list their names together; when Miller refused to take sole credit, Rodriguez resigned from the Directors' Guild so both their names could appear together.<br /><br />Like Zack Snyder's recent popular film version of Miller's THE 300, this is about as faithful a translation of Miller's graphic-novel vision to the screen as could be imagined. Miller's own layouts and storytelling is so cinematic that it translates gorgeously onto the screen. And, as with THE 300, the violence is so over-the-top and cartoonish its almost impossible to be offended by it. The great gushing fluids that come out of the characters here is not only ridiculously copious but at likely to be white or black (or, with one character, yellow) as it is red. More than anything else, this is an extended and gorgeous exercise in style. It takes what was once held as an offshoot of realism -- the Mickey Spillane-style noir detective fiction -- and spins out all its most baroque excesses to show its theatricality and artifice. All the adult women are gorgeous prostitutes or strippers; all the villains want to prey on little girls or innocents (sometimes literally); the heroes' eventual Jacobean punishments for their foes are as imaginatively and grimly excessive as possible. As gorgeous and florid as this all is, though, it's hard at times to see its point. None of the characters are real at all: their two-dimensionality is of course an absolute given of the story's artistic premises. And while the grotesque tortures and killings initially shock, through extended repetition they begin to lose any sort of effect on your senses. After a while all you can do is react to the visual beauty of the compositions, and even that gets a bit dulled after a while. Probably this would have made an extremely effective (and equally gorgeous) short film.</p></body></html>

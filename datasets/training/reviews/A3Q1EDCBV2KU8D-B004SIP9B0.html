<meta name="summary" content="Behind the scenes versus the public eye"></head><body><p>This movie did a good job of showing how the public eye sees reality and how that reality could be seen from the eyes of those in the public.  This gives a dramatic review of how the events around the Death of Diana could have unfolded.  The acting was done quite well and it was easy to move into this reality for a bit.  You even felt compassion for the Royal family and for the difficult situation that the Prime Minister was in.  In the end, it was a good movie for expanding the understanding of what happened from another perspective.</p></body></html>

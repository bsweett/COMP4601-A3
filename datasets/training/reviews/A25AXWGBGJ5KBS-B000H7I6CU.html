"Cars" was his first experience in a real movie theater. On DVD, he used to watch it several times a day; it was basically background to his daily activities running around playing at home.<br />He knows the movie intimately, and since he knows how to use the remotes, actually maneuvers around the film at will.<br /><br />Well, I was recuperating from surgery, and I plopped this disc into my new Blu-ray player the afternoon after my hernia repair. Ben plopped down right next to me, seeing the disc case, asking, "Are you going to watch "Cars"? Can I watch it with you?"<br /><br />The movie loaded and unspooled, and you would have thought he had never seen it before.<br />Was it the three-dimensional, hypnotizing, hyper-real images? Was it the completely enveloping audio mix?<br />Who knows? But let me tell you WHATEVER it was, it worked magic on my little guy. He got back into the movie as if it was a totally new experience.<br /><br />Now as a father who probably could lip-synch the movie if pressed, I have to tell you the same exact thing happened to me. I was lost in this "Cars" world. The picture was crystalline; the audio pure.<br /><br />What an extraordinary experience for a film buff! I felt a true sense of rediscovery. Details, in-jokes, audio subtleties..."Freebird" indeed.<br /><br />Anyone who owns a Blu-ray player should have a copy of this already on their shelf.</p></body></html>

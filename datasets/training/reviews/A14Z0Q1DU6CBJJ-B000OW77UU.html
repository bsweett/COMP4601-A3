It tells the true story of CHRIS GARDNER, a man who, along with his son Christopher, lived on the streets of San Francisco as he explored the shot in the dark chance that he would be one of 20 men who would be offered a job after an internship at a brokerage firm.<br /><br />Very few people could actually survive living life on the streets of America and Chris Gardner is one of them. PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS shows how the homeless community in America isn't always drunks and loonies. The film captures the downward spiral and the desperation that Gardner experienced. Not to mention, it is captured incredibly well by Will Smith.<br /><br />This is a movie not to miss. Heartbreaking and inspirational. Don't miss the MEET CHRIS GARDNER featurette in the special features. Almost as interesting as the film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A tense, Exciting, And Dramatic Spectacular of WWII!"></head><body><p>No one was a more masterful film maker than was David Lean, the British  director who brought us such unforgettable classics as "Lawrence of  Arabia", "Doctor Zhivago", "Ryan's Daughter" and, of course, "Bridge Over  the River Kwai", (see my reviews of all these films). The cinematography in  all of Lean's films is always spectacular and breathtaking, for Lean had a  special appreciation for how the nature of one's natural surroundings set  the stage and influenced the dramatic proceedings. Lean characteristically  focused his films on the ways in which individuals and their personal  characteristics clash and meld with the larger social, cultural, and  historical surround in which they are located, and so each film is a  uniquely captivating study of the specific dynamics of each particular  individual situation. <p>Each of these films is also a well-choreographed  and photographed excursion into the topography, climate, and landscape of  the geographic location in which the drama unfolds. The eyes and ears are  always delighted by what Lean displays. In "Bridge Over The River Kwai",  the first of these spectacular films to be produced by Lean, the wildness  and danger of the surrounding jungle is used as an active metaphor by Lean  which he uses to bind the British prisoners into a life and death struggle  with the despotic camp commander, whose feudal philosophy leads him to view  the prisoners as shameful cowards who do not deserve to be treated like  human beings.  Their curiously na?ve and self-important commanding officer,  played brilliantly by Sir Alec Guiness, immediately becomes embroiled in a  power struggle with the Japanese commander that sets the plot churning into  overdrive, speeding the story along toward further confrontations and a  number of interesting plot twist.  <p>Also excellent as a cynical American  sailor landlocked in the camp is William Holden, who plays the part with  such blithe and careless detachment it is hard to appreciate how good he  is, unless you are familiar with his performance in other films such as  "The Bridges At Toko-Ri" or "Network". The supporting cast is excellent,  and the script, written by the novelist who penned the original book, is  taut, lean, and full of memorable dialogue and terrific dramatics. The  action unfolds as part of the larger context of the war itself, which  provides the necessary impetus to explain the desperate, cruel, and  courageous behavior of the characters. The cinematography here is  absolutely breath-taking, and the many spectacular action sequences and  memorable musical score all contribute to make this one of the most popular  and memorable films of all time. By the way, the film has aged very well,  and as a piece of history and as a piece of popular entertainment it is  always a pleasure to view as one of the outstanding films of the 1950s.</p></body></html>

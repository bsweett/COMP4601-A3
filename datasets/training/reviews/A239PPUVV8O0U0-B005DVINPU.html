Now I know I previously praised that film but the original is undoubtedly the best. Michael Keaton is my favorite of all the movie incarnations. Kilmer was OK and Clooney was just a joke. Bale does a good job and I commend him on actually using two different voices for Bruce and Batman but not in this manner. Sounds like he has lung cancer or something. Now Keaton does use a different voice; he subtly lowers his voice. And when Bale is in his Bruce Wayne persona, he acts to hard to through people off. When Keaton was cast as Batman, there was a public outcry as people couldn't picture him as Batman. Isn't that how it's supposed to be? You shouldn't suspect him at all. The suit in this film is way better than in the films to follow (except Returns as that was pretty much the same suit with minor alterations). It's classic Batman. Keaton handles the action well and the quiet moments are standout (there aren't really any quiet moments [except in Returns] in any of the sequels). Kim Basinger is good as Vicki, noting that she's essentially a knockoff of Lois Lane back in the 50s. And she's a much better actress than Holmes/Gyllenhal (or however you spell her name) in the newer films. They look like clueless teens who somehow ended up in a big superhero film. And Nicholson is my favorite modern live-action Joker. Not to knock Heath Ledger, he was good too, but the way Nicholson played him is actually the way the Joker should be played; a psychopathic clown who commits his crimes with a flair for the theatrical. If he's gonna kill ya, he's gonna do it in style. Billy Dee Williams should've had more screen time as Harvey Dent and he was contracted to play Two-Face but he was paid out and we got...over-the-top Tommy Lee Jones. Michael Gough's Alfred is good but I prefer the Michael Caine version as he's more involved with things. Pat Hingle's Commissioner Gordon is hardly in the film to really critique so Gary Oldman's version is better. Danny Elfman delivers with the music, providing a theme for Batman that rivals John Williams' Superman, but the actual person conducting the orchestra is none other than Shirley Walker, the woman who would provide the music for Batman: The Animated Series and most of its subsequent spin-offs.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Don't mess with a classic."></head><body><p>Halloween directed and written and directed by Rob Zombie (of all people!) is a terrible remake of the 1978 classic. It's a new take on Halloween, the characters have more of a back story and jeez there's a lot of blood and nudity in this one, this film doesn't work at all. The dialogue is cheesy and lame as hell, Zombie isn't a literary god not even a little. The acting is embarrassing, I can't believe Zombie couldn't find any decent actors and of course he put his real-life wife in this as Michael Myers mother, she plays a stripper! Thank god I have the original to fall back on, this remake was a complete waste of time!</p></body></html>

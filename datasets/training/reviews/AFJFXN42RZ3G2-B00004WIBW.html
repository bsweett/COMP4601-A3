<meta name="summary" content="The Irving Tale With a Twist"></head><body><p>Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is an eerie version of the Washington Irving short story that goes beyond the initial narrative.  Burton twists the storyline and makes it his own, but he keeps the main premise and setting of the story:  Capturing the Headless Horseman, a Hessian mercenary (Christopher Walken), who came to America's shores to seek carnage but loses his head during his mission.  He wreaks havoc along the countryside twenty years later after losing his head in order to seek revenge and a head of his own.  He has no bounds, and he beheads anyone who gets in his way.  Sleepy Hollow takes place in 1799 in the village town of Tarrytown, New York upon the heels of the turn of the century, and Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), an eccentric investigator, is responsible for restoring the town's peace from the Headless Horseman.  Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) is the daughter of the head townsman who has ties to the supernatural, and takes a liking to Ichabod.<br /><br />The film itself is amazing.  Burton adds a gothic dimension to Irving's tale and captures the gothic aspect of the story with a dark, foggy, and gory exhibition that is displayed with the characters, costumes and props in the film.  The cinematography is exceptional as well as Burton's teaming with Danny Elfman for the film's score.  The film has an array of horrific scenes of bloody gore, but the most interesting one is the scene where Ichabod takes jabs at a creepy tree with an axe that splashes out blood.  He discovers a most gruesome discovery as he digs deep within the tree, which will make you leap out of your pants.  Sleepy Hollow possesses the Burton traits that many will identify with:  Gray skies and dark nights that resonate doom and gloom and sunless snowy endings, and tinges of dysfunction within the family.  For example, Ichabod Crane is an investigator, but in his own life, he has unending nightmares of his loving mother and his monster-like father lurking in the background.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow will frighten anyone who is looking for a horror film during a Halloween night or anytime of the year.  However, this is not a film for small children, and I recommend Disney's version of "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."  Nevertheless, Burton captures the Halloween spirit with much precision.  This quirky and scary horror flick will not disappoint those looking for the macabre in a film.</p></body></html>

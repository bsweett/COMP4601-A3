This movie is a thriller with no thrills, an intellectual mystery with no mystery or intellect.  It's a film that, despite having good actors, setting and covering an interesting topic, is a commercial flop.  Tom Hanks, the protagonist, perhaps interprets one of the worst roles of his career, and there is little connection between him and Audrey Tatou as a couple.  She, incidentally, has a mediocre performance too. In short, The Da Vinci Code, a high budget film with good actors, is long winded, banal and mediocre.</p></body></html>

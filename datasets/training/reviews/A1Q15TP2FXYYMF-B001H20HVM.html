<meta name="summary" content="Brilliantly Intense"></head><body><p>This is a brilliantly put together film not with relatively known actors as i feel having big actors in horror movies ruins the whole movie. Jigsaw is back again and he is out to prove peoples will to survive no matter what the odds.<br /><br />In this film we get to see Jigsaw for the first time and we learn why he started his sick survival games.<br /><br />This is a captivating movie that instead of just one persons will to live it is a team of 6 or 7 people who must all work together to work their way out.<br /><br />This like the first movie has an incredible twist at the end which not only leaves a window open for a cliffhanger but also leaves you sitting there in amazement at how you where fooled by the whole film.<br /><br />I strongly suggest this film as it is truly amazing.</p></body></html>

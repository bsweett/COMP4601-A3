<meta name="summary" content="Denzel gives a great performance"></head><body><p>Denzel does a great job playing a former government agent assigned to protect a little girl from kidnapping in Mexico City.  When he is assigned he is ready to kill himself.  He and the little girl develop a type of father/child relationship that is so strong that it gives him reason to live.  When the girl is actually kidnapped, Denzel goes on a rampage against anyone that was involved, meting out vigilante justice.<br /><br />Some scenes may be a little graphically violent and the actual kidnapping scene is a heartbreaker, but it is a story that it is one of those rare action films that has its heartwarming scenes too!  Christopher Walken is pretty good as Denzel's friend and look for Marc Anthony as the little girl's father.</p></body></html>

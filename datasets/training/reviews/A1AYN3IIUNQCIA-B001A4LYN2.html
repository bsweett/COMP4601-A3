I can't quite put my finger on it but there is just something so hypnotic about this film that, from the very first scene, you can't help but become oddly entranced by it all. From the almost silent fifteen first minutes to the strangely engrossing oil scenes, the slighty hysteric rantings of crazed young preacher Eli, even the almost curve ball final act, you can't help want to see more and more of the film and when it does end, you leaves you sitting there, almost tempted to want to rewatch the film all over again. Again, I can't figure out what it was but whatever it is, it just leaves you with that satisfied movie going experience.<br /><br />We are taken into the life of the charasmatic and slightly eccentric Daniel Plainview, who describes himself as a professional oil man. Already having made a impressive buisness of himself, he is approached by a young man who gives him a tip that the town he lives in may have a vast underground oil supply. Seeing the opportunity at hand, he packs up his equipment and with his son H.W. in tow, sets off for the small town with great intentions in mind. Along the way, he makes himself a rival in the form of Eli Sunday, twin brother of the boy who gave Daniel the tip off. A overbearing bible thumper, he has the same intentions of greatness as Daniel and as the movie goes on, there rivalry slowy grow as they try to make their goals into reality.<br /><br />First thing is first, all the acting is definently on par. Paul Dano (probally best known from his role in Little Miss Sunshine) brings a fire and intensity to his characters, his big scenes never boarding as over the top or zanny but just the right amount of fantatasism and passion. And as for Daniel Day Lewis, a very well known character actor with some pretty odd methods of preparing for a role, once again submerges himself into this role. He spits fire, his eyes burn with intensity, never does his performance go over to the hammy side, which in a role like this could have very easily went over the top. Oscar worthy, definently.<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson has always been a personal favorite of mine, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, both super diffrent films and each one so very diffrent in there own mind, and each on effective in their purpose. This was his much needed comeback film after the pretty average Punch Drunk Love, once again taking care in his work and producing an engrossing story that has you hooked from the beginning. Everything else is also great, Cinematography just pops, Art Direction is just the right amount of grit, everything in this film comes together.<br /><br />My one main critisism would probally have to be that this film may have been a bit to over hyped. Reading reviews, I've probally glimpsed the word 'Masterpiece' used in almost every single one. I wouldn't go to far as to call this film a masterpiece, I could probally name about twenty other films in the past eight years that can easily out surpass this film in terms of quality and impact. It kind of suffered the same effect as No Country for Old Men, but unlike the later film which I felt was severly overrated, this one actually deserved most of its praise.<br /><br />Other then that, it's definantly one of the films to see from 2007. Great direction, great acting, its a must see for movie lovers and a must have for PTS fans.</p></body></html>

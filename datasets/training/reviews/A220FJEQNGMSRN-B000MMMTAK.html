<meta name="summary" content="Cohen shows his cajones"></head><body><p>The free-running sequence in Casino Royale may be breathtaking, but it doesn't quite manage to provide the best fight scene of 2006 - that honor goes to the notorious one in Borat which, like Casino Royale, also involves testicles in an example of dedication by an actor that makes Christian Bale's weight loss in The Machinist look like phoning it in. You have to admire Cohen's cajones (which are on view in more ways than one) as he goes above and beyond the call of duty in his determination to stay in character no matter how hostile the environment he's helped to create. It's pretty easy to spot the faked or partialy faked sequences - the friendly Jewish couple who rent them a room, the children at the ice cream truck, the Pamela Anderson finale - and most of the victims that aren't faked are more than deserving of their fate (the racist rodeo impresario, the frat boys) or handle themselves well (the feminists). Even the villagers currently suing can't really have much of a case: the moment an extra agrees to put a d***o on as a prosthetic arm, it's pretty obvious they're not participating in a documentary. (Hell, they're not even real Kazaks, so it's not as if they're playing themselves!) And yes, it is very funny even if, like most comedies, it does run out of steam in the `serious' last act.<br /><br />Although there's been some criticism of the exras on the DVD, it's a decent enough package.</p></body></html>

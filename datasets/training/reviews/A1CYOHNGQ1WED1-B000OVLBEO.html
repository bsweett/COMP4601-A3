In the ensuing years he does more and more dangerous stunts because he knows he can't die. One day the Devil comes back to collect on the deal, forcing Cage to become the Ghost Rider, collecting the souls of evil men. The Devil's son Blackheart also shows up, opposing his father, catching Ghost Rider in the middle of the fight. Sam Elliott plays a previous Ghost Rider from a century and a half ago who helps Cage understand what is going on.<br /><br />The plot was promising but Ghost Rider bored me. The performances were all right but the script wasn't very well written and the entire story failed to grab me. The effects were the real star of the movie and that's a problem. The effects were cool most of the time but they can't make up for the movies' flaws, the biggest of which was they didn't make me care about the characters and what happened to them.</p></body></html>

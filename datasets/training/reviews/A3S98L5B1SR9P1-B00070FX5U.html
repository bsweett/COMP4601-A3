One day after work, he books a vacation with Rekall Inc., a company that sells implanted memories, hoping to find out more information about what he's been dreaming about. He decides that he wants an implant that assigns him as a secret agent who has to rescue a woman. Unfortunately, during the implanation process, something goes wrong. His identity clashes with the implant's secret agent identity and he wakes up in a world that seems familiar, yet is strangely different. He remembers that he is a secret agent in this dream world, and discovers that his close friends and wife have orders to murder him. Quaid has to discover his true identity, whether his visions are reality or thoughts, and who to trust in order to return to the real world.</p></body></html>

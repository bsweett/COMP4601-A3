<meta name="summary" content="In all seriousness, could be the funniest movie EVER!!"></head><body><p>For those who don't "get" the humor in this movie, it may seem like a 90 minute detour into one of the outer circles of hell.  Actors playing multiple roles, idiots smacking coconut shells together to make horse-sounds, men playing most of the female roles, modern-day police tracking medieval knights, the use of the word "nee" to a huge extent and lots of blood gouting from gory wounds.  For those people, I can only have pity.<p>Because to love HOLY GRAIL is to establish a life-long friendship.  I've never known anyone who was lukewarm about the film.  Hate it (see above) and you just scratch your head in wonder at its popularity.  Love it,and you find yourself quoting it often and watching it over and over.  My family and I watch this movie at least once a year.  When my son (now 15) first watched this movie with me, I knew it was an important moment in our relationship.  Would he think his dad was weird for recommending this old British piece of junk?  Or would he join the club of fanatics?  Let's just say that we now own almost everything by Monty Python that is available on DVD and we're saving up for FAWLTY TOWERS.  For him, it was the Dark Knight's duel with King Arthur that first made him a believer.<p>I won't rehash the plot...that probably isn't possible.  But suffice it to say that I don't think anyone should skip this movie.  Yes, you might hate it.  If so, I'm sorry.  But there's a good chance you'll be sucked in and then you too can quote "It's only a flesh wound" or "Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberry" or "There are those who call me...Tim."  And you can enjoy, again and again, the vicious attacks of the white rabbit.  (If you have the DVD, I challenge you to watch the rabbit attack on super-slow motion...it's a historian's study on great film editing and it's also gut-bustingly funny!)  You can learn to count to five...uh, three.  You can learn to insult like the French.  And on and on.  <p>The deluxe DVD set comes with a 2nd disc full of extras.  Not much of it is indispensible, but it's certainly worth the extra few bucks.  There is a complete redo of the CAMELOT song, except done entirely with legos which makes the 2nd disc worthwhile right there.</p></body></html>

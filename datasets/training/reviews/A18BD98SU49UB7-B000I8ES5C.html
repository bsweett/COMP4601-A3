<meta name="summary" content="What a cool Flick."></head><body><p>A nice mix of Kill Bill and Hotshots.<br /><br />I have watched thousands of movies, reviewed hundreds on amazon or otherwise, and can honestly say that Kung fu Hustle made me laugh like no other.<br /><br />Seriously, I could go into the plot, which is more or less an excuse for more awesome acrobatic achievements of excellence, but Kung fu hustle is about the prat-falls. It's Flat out hilarious. Never have I laughed for the duration of an entire film.<br /><br />It seems that Bruce Lee and the Wachowski's have finally met the Anamaniacs. Support the cause, go see it, then tell your friends. Kung fu Hustle is a fantastically unique bit of coolness. ~saos~</p></body></html>

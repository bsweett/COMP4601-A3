<meta name="summary" content="To be remembered as Natalie Portman's first adult role"></head><body><p>Twenty years from now, the only reason 'Closer' will be remembered is because it represents Natalie Portman's first 'adult' role.  The Golden Globes got it right: she and Clive Owen dominate the proceedings here, lording over supposed leading lights Julia Roberts and Jude Law.  With Owen, it's even more impressive when you consider that he played Law's character in the original London play.<br /><br />Under Mike Nichols' direction, 'Closer' is about as close a thing to a play on screen as you're ever going to see.  Only six characters are credited, and in fact characters five (taxi driver) and six (secretary) have one line apiece.<br /><br />I do have to credit Nichols for a wonderfully imagined beginning - the scene of Law and Portman eyeing each other on the street for the first time (in super slo-mo) with Damien Rice's "Blower's Daughter" essentially narrating the scene is an unsurpassed cinematic moment.</p></body></html>

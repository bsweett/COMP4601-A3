<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton's "Wonderland" Adventure"></head><body><p>After the missed opportunity of Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature (not to mention Paramount's 1933 live-action curio), director Tim Burton takes Lewis Carroll on a cinematic roller-coaster ride. The 2010 "Alice in Wonderland" has an enchanting spark that somehow eluded Disney nearly 60 years earlier. Mia Wasikowska's inspired performance as a refreshingly mature Alice is well-matched by Helena Bonham Carter's wicked Red Queen and Johnny Depp's twisted Mad Hatter. A tad slow at times, but endlessly imaginative in the Burton tradition. In fact, the new version would make a terrific double-bill with "Beetlejuice."</p></body></html>

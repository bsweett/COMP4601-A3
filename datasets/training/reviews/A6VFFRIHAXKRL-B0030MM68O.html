<meta name="summary" content="It's ok 6.5/10"></head><body><p>I know people are going to leave immature comments of like how dare you (insert here) boo hoo boo hoo boo hoo boo hoo wan wan. But I felt it was overrated & when I say overrated it doesn't mean it was bad. It had good characters it wasn't to cliche it had really strong scenes the movie does make you use your head I felt the adrenaline pump during the bomb defuseal scenes I really was like oh these guys are f****d during 1 of the shoot out scenes. There aren't a lot of female directors out there but it's nice to see a female director get her props I was entertained sure I was I just felt it was overrated to the max & it wasn't God awful like Halloween 2 I just saw it's just ok. IMO it's worth a rental nothing I'll go & buy right now maybe $5 in a bargain bin. If you just thought it was just the greatest movie ever it's fine I got some enjoyment out of it but it was over hyped it's my opinion. So to each there own.</p></body></html>

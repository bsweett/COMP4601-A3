Wonder if it was going to fall apart while you rode it. It gave you a thrill didn't it? This movie will too. It may be a different approach to horror/comedy but it is definitely fun. Some fans of Bruce Campbell's horror movies may be a little disappointed in this B style movie. It isn't the in your face comedy/horror you would normally expect from Bruce Campbell. After the Evil Dead/Evil Dead 2/Army of Darkness trilogy and some of the TV shows and other parts Bruce Campbell has done some expect a crazy fast paced movie. This movie is not the same kind of comedy. It is more subtle and you must be patient with the slower story development. I enjoyed it myself but it was not quite what some people will expect.<br /><br />Campbell does a great job playing an aged Elvis impersonator. When he is faced with a mummy soul sucker at his retirement home things get strange. Bruce plays Elvis Presley or an impersonator, you have to figure it out. Ossie Davis plays John Kennedy or someone that is nuts, once again you must figure it out. This story concept is great and it is fun working out who Bruce and Ozzie really are throughout the movie. The special effects on the mummy aren't bad and even the back story is great, but the jokes are a bit different. When it is announced this is made by some of the same people that made the Evil Dead movies you might expect this to be a wild and crazy ride. It isn't, so go into it expecting a slower ride and you will enjoy it much more. I'm glad I rented it, it was well worth seeing. I bought a copy because I can see this being fun to watch every Halloween.</p></body></html>

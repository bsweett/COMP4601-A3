<meta name="summary" content="The Queen"></head><body><p>In the first week of September 1997, between the death of Princess Diana and her funeral, Queen Elizabeth (Mirren) was in a situation that she had no preparation for.  She did not feel anything should be done for the princess by the monarchy, as she has divorced from Prince Charles (Jennings), but the people of England were looking to her to show some compassion.  Newly elected Prim Minister Tony Blair (Sheen) attempts to offer advice to the Queen, but he mostly rebuffed.  Adding to the tension is the fact that Blair's popularity skyrockets in this time of national mourning.<br /><br />"The Queen" is a fascinating look into the world of the British Monarchy.  I know very little about it, and the film held my interest throughout.  Mirren is excellent as a queen who is struggling to maintain the only lifestyle she has ever known in the face of changing times and a popular ex-monarch's death.  Sheen is also good as Tony Blair.  All in all, "The Queen" is an extremely engaging film that is worth seeing.</p></body></html>

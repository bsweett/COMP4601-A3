But he is more of a liability than an asset in his recent movies including King Kong and now Nacho Libre.  I popped this into the player and sat back wondering what the hell was going on.  Besides the pointless plot, the movie is just not funny.  Watching Black run around shirtless, occansionally farting, and getting beat up is only funny for so long.  The HD DVD picture quality was decent, but it certainly did not make this movie worth watching.</p></body></html>

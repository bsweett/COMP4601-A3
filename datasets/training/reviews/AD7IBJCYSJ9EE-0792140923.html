I won't spoil the rest.<br /><br />MY OPINION: This movie is a masterpice. It's funny, sad, has action, and a story that flows smoothly. No wonder it won many awards. Tom Hanks plays FG with soul. It's a pretty long movie, too. Everybody should see it. Oh, BTW, Ralph Kramden, the reviewer below me, forgot to mention that he never saw the movie, and he is just being a smarta*s.</p></body></html>

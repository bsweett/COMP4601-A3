<meta name="summary" content="A  movie that moves at my speed."></head><body><p>I have seen Jim Jarmusch's earlier work (Stranger than Paradise) as well as his later work (Ghost Dog) and so I had an idea about what he'd do with this film, but the cast also got me excited once I heard about them.  One thing that's most striking about the film is the use of silence to convey things.  Jarmusch uses it in part to signal the awkwardness of everyday conversation and experience as well as for the purpose of outlining what his character is like.  He has no problem having minutes of silence where the only realization is that the main character is bored, lives a boring life,  and has no desire to really do anything remotely interesting.  These things add up to an experience that most filmgoers are not going to appreciate, or like.  Most people are trained to believe that everything that makes it into the film must be interesting, when in actuality the rule is that everything that makes it into the film must be in the film.  That last sentence is not meant to suggest that the film doesn't have interesting moments, because it does it's just that the film doesn't feel it's necessary to interesting from beginning to end. The run through of the story is that Don Johnston is a wealthy man who's trade was computers and now he doesn't even have computer at home.  His girlfriend leaves him and notes that he just recieved a letter that is probably from another one of his girlfriends. He reads it and is nonplussed. It is an anonymous letter stating that he has a son and the son has come looking for him, he reads this to a friend who interested in writing mystery novels so the friend looks into solving the myster for him by setting up detailed plans for Don to seek and find out who the mother is.  He goes to all of the women he was with at the time, that he remembers and follows a simple plan (he brings pink flowers, since the envelope and paper it was written on were in pink and it was typed on a typewriter, so he asks about them when he goes).  Each woman presents an entirely different obstacle for Don to overcome.  With the first woman it's her daughter, with the second it's her husband, with the third it's her receptionist, with the fourth it's her boyfriend (?) and his friend and the fifth girl is dead.  Some of these encounters are funny, some are violent, and some are uncomfortable.  Mainly I find it interesting how Jarmusch decided to make a movie about a character who doesn't want a movie made about him, wouldn't care if there was, and has not interest in seeing it even if he lived next to the theatre. Making the main character a reluctant and offbeat character enhances this story in a way that obviously won't appeal to many people, but it appealed to me. Also, the acting in some of the scenes was simply excellent. For instance, the scene in which he goes to see his former lover who has become a real estate broker and he ends up eating dinner with them. In this scene Christopher McDonald is simply great. Although the film has a relaxed attitude about the mystery that spurs the action forward, it still has some interesting features of the most interesting mysteries.  It has plotlines and clues that may or may not lead to anything.  I'm not giving anything away by saying that this film leaves some of the mystery wide open while dispelling some of it. What's also funny about this mystery are the dreams he has where he's internally processing different things he notices during his journeys.  You wonder if they will actuall lead to anything and that is something I will leave to those who to see the movie to find out.  As for Murray, I like this part of his career just as much as when he was younger.  He may be funny, but now he's working on being more than that and in this film some of his decisions are divisive, but I'm glad that he's making them because they make his characters more individual and you can't just say that they're the "The stock Bill Murray character." I wouldn't have given the film a prize persay, but enjoy it nonetheless.</p></body></html>

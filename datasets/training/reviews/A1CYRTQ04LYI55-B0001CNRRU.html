<meta name="summary" content="A heavy collision of imperfect people"></head><body><p>21 Grams is a heavy movie - despite a light title.  The story is about the collisions, literal and figurative, between three imperfect people:  A religeous fanatic with a dark past, a cheating husband with a critical heart problem, and a drug addicted widow.  The movie operates as a series of flashbacks and fast-forwards, much along the lines of Amores Perros and City of God.  It's a bit faster, which makes it optimal to see the movie in one sitting to keep up.  (I saw it in several, which detracted from the viewing)<br /><br />In the end it's easy to see the movie as a work of art.  It's best at it's darkest.  People really don't lose 21 Grams when they die, and the spiritual side is weaker.  Even with that, if you like the genre, you'll like the movie, even if it's not as solid as others.  All movies don't need to fit the Hollywood stereotype.</p></body></html>

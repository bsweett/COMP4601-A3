<meta name="summary" content="GREAT movie for Valentine's day!"></head><body><p>First off before I say anything about this movie...have you ever read the book 'Intensity' by Dean Koontz? Well...this movie, whether intending to or not, is the movie for that book. Until the ending. The ending..imo..was horrible for this movie. I didnt like it at all, and wish they hadn't done it that way.<br /><br />BUT..for the most part, the movie was fkn awesome for a Horror movie. Because it's been a few months since I seen it, I dont remember the names of the characters. I'm also sitting here...thinking of a way to review this movie, without ruining anything. Because when I read the book Intenisty..it was just that..INTENSE. The movie starts off a TAD slow with two girls that are friends (one of them being our main girl) going home to the non-main girls family for vacation I believe. It seems to be a nice little home and nice parents. Then at night while everyone is in bed (and our main girl being naughty with herself), there is a knock on the door. Dad goes downstairs to see who it is. And then all...psychotic..hell..breaks loose. And it doesnt just stay in the house. It goes on the road also.<br /><br />Basically..i really dont want to even give away anything that happens. This is definitely a Thrasher Psychotic Horror. And I was REALLY enjoying the story also that went along with it. That is..up until the ending which really made me cringe and roll my eyes. I wanted to punch the director in the throat for making such a good movie and then just fkn it all up at the end. Also if you like gore..this movie has some good scenes that made me laugh and say 'HOLY *bleep*, THAT'S *bleeped* UP!'.<br /><br />Even though I hate the ending, that didnt ruin the WHOLE movie. If you are a slasher movie fan, I think you'll love this movie.</p></body></html>

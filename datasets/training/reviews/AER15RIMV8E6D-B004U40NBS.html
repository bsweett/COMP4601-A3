<meta name="summary" content="MY 1000TH REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>This movie is crazy! Natalie Portman gave an amazing performance! I might be off on this, but it's like 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'Burlesque' mixed together in a psychological thriller. Portman stars as Nina, a ballet dancer who must compete for the main lead in the Swan Lake play. Nina's mother is very controlling and treats her like a child. (Similar to Carrie White's mother) Nina starts having hallucinations and becomes paranoid because she really wants the part of both the White and Black Swan. I would recommend BLACK SWAN!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />P.S. It's been awesome writing 1000 reviews, and can't wait to write 1000 more!</p></body></html>

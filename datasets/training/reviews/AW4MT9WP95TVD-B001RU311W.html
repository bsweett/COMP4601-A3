Not only does Penn become Harvey Milk, but the whole cast is superb.  Every performance is excellent particularly Emil Hirsch, Josh Brolin and James Franco. (the only odd one is Dieago Luna who, for some reason reminded me of Stephen Rea in Interview with a Vampire).<br /><br />VanSant does a spectactular job incorporating the historical footage without disrupting the flow of the film.  He manages to pull together a moving and inspiring portrait of people in a time when complacency was not the answer.<br /><br />I hope this does a bit to inspire more people to action today.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Perhaps Inspired by Yul Brynner's Gunslinger"></head><body><p>I liked THE TERMINATOR when I originally saw it. I think it was somewhat innovative and Arnold Schwarzenegger was very good as the cyborg that will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission. Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance seems to have been inspired by Yul Brynner as the gunslinger robot in WESTWORLD. Brynner's obsessively determined performance was brilliant in that film. The difference here is that you almost begin to empathize with Brynner's obsession as if perhaps he wanted to have been created as a human being and not a robot.  Brynner does have his catharsis. Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator has less aspirations and has only a singular purpose in this film. Schwarzenegger's performance is not exactly endearing but he does come across with a certain amount of misplaced aplomb, which adds to his absurdity and fascinating screen presence. Has it really been that many years since this came out!</p></body></html>

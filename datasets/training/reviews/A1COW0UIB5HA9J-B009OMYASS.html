<meta name="summary" content="A flawed but good horror thriller!"></head><body><p>Two American pals named Paxton and Josh(Jay Herandez and Derek Richardson) are traveling around Europe for some fun and sex. They meet an Icelandic man  (Eythor Gudjonsson) during their trip in Amesterdam as they head to a Slovokian city where they stay at a local hostel and get laid with beautiful girls. However, their ideal vacation soon turns into a nightmare of vicious terror as they are taken to a special secret place where criminals torture and kill people for profit, can they escape this living hell?<br /><br />Exciting and violent horror crime thriller from writer-director Eli Roth ("Cabin Fever") and producer Quentin Tarantino, the film is quite flawed such as the acting (you can overlook that) and some of the dialog. But there is some sleazy atmosphere and gory torture scenes to make up for those such as an icky eyeball torture sequence done to a Japanese tourist. The film does pay tribute to the torture films such "Ichi The Killer", "Men Behind The Sun", "Guiena Pig", "Audition", "Mark of the Devil", "The New York Ripper" and of course "Bloodsucking Freaks". Even if the film is tame compared to those movies, it's still a nice and atmospheric shock-feast with sex and violence abound especially hot babes even a cameo by director Takashi Miike.<br /><br />This 2-dis DVD set has the unrated director's cut and the extras include four audio commentaries, alternate ending, Hostel Dissected three part featurette, Kill the car multi-angel interactive featurette, music and sound featurette, Set Design featurette, An Icelandic meal with Eythor Gudjonsson featurette, KNB effects featurette, interview with Takashi Miike, Hostel dismembered International TV special and The Treatment radio interview with Eli Roth.</p></body></html>

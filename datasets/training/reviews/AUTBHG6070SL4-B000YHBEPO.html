Now, let's play.<br /><br />Tom Cruise does a great job with the Rube Goldberg plots and gadgetry. There's a lot of running around on rooftops, swinging through the air, and other good fun. There was one huge cop-out though. We see Cruise enter the top-secret bioweapon lab (downtown Hong Kong? is that really the best place for it?), and leave a moment later with the goodies. C'mon guys - what happened inside? Armed guards? Secured labs? Guessing the way around an unfamiliar rabbit-warren of lab corridors? All in a day's work, I guess, nothing worth writing about.<br /><br />It's good excitement, but don't expect anything more. If you have an evening to kill at the movies. Cruise is the man to kill it for you.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

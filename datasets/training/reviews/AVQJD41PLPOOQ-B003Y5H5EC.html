<meta name="summary" content="Not a believable moment in it!"></head><body><p>This movie was filled with garbage I could not swallow.  I'm sure I've met overly-mature children before, but to suggest the diabolical, calculated revenge tactics that actress Ellen Page displays, even for the sake of fiction, is beyond my belief.<br /><br />Would you believe I actually found myself rooting for the victim of the 32 year-old photographer???  Why?  Because although his character was totally inapropriate, the story did nothing to convince me that he was the monster this little tries to get him to be.  By the time she was castrating him, I swear, I wanted him to kill her.<br /><br />If you're going to show a 14 year-old girl taking revenge against a monster, convince me that he's a monster, and don't wait until two minutes before he hangs himself on the roof of his building to do it!</p></body></html>

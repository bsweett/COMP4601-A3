<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly conventional thriller - -  still entertaining."></head><body><p>The movie starts out fairly "realistically" employing simply camera techniques and ends up being a silly exercise in the cheap use of computer ghost imagery.<p>I was surprised to find out that this film was directed by Zemeckis.  Considering how well crafted and inventive his other films such as Forrest Gump and Castaway were, this film resorts to corny special effects and hackneyed suspense techniques.  This film has been compared to Hitchcocks films.  The difference however is that Hitchcock will employ brilliant camera techniques and timing and music -- NOT cop-out techniques of artificial CGI to paste in ghost images.<p>Furthermore Harrison Ford's character development is simply inconsistent and rather unbelievable.  This is a well done "made-for-tv" movie.</p></body></html>

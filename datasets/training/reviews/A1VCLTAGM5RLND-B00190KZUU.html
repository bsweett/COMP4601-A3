<meta name="summary" content="What a waste of silver nitrate"></head><body><p>Quite possibly the most overrated movie of recent times.<br /><br />Eclectric but not useful in any way. So far fetched that it was untraceable.<br /><br />If people believed this movie touched their hearts or some other part of their body, they may need help.<br /><br />As one who can handle fantasy and bizarre themes, I was expecting, at least in some part, a movie that could give me something.<br /><br />My only piece of empathy was with the son who had been lied to all through his life and could not pick fact from fiction. Everyone loves a dad who has a wild imagination and funny stories but here was a kid who still, in his 30's had never been in touch with his dad.</p></body></html>

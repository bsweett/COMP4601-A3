<meta name="summary" content="Will Smith and a Coming of Age"></head><body><p>Will Smith stars with his son Jaden in this true story about going for it all when life seems like it is giving you no opportunity at all.<br /><br />Chris Gardner was always working to make it selling medical equipment which he acquired out of his own pocket to sell to small Doctors offices.  His family life is in shambles and he is really going nowhere with a son who is caught between Gardner and his ex.  Gardner thinks about an opportunity he hears of working for an investment firm as an intern and he goes for it.<br /><br />He faces many challenges while attempting to even get into the program, where only one person of all who go through it are selected.  The premise of the movie, is that we in the USA have the right to pursue happiness.  It is not a given.  Carter worked to pursue what would make him happy and this movie is even a way to give back.<br /><br />You will see some of the actual areas where Carter actually operated, even the homeless shelter is the actual one where he stayed eeking out a living.  (The DVDs features will tell you a whole lot more about that that is even touching just by itself.)<br /><br />This is a movie about winning in life, and mostly, not giving up when things seem the worst.  I could name a cliche or two, but really, this man applied what it took for him to be a success, and Smith really delivers.<br /><br />I cannot understand the one and two star votes here.  This is a movie of meaning and Smith does an outstanding performance.  Get Pursuit of Happyness, you just might learn something.</p></body></html>

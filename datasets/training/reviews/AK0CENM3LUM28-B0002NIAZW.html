Though the science is soft, the movie at least admits that what is happening is completely off the charts for expected (i.e. 'realistic') behavior, which is more than most movies are willing to admit (see, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AKCKM">The Core</a>). And though the usual cast of disaster movie characters are present, including the ubiquitous Unreliable Dad Who Comes Through In The End, I was beyond pleased to note that the movie didn't belabor the characters by beating the particularly dead horse of disaster movie character tropes and, instead, just continued firmly on to the action. As such, we are spared all the "This is why we are divorced/separated/whiny!" dialogue between the Unreliable Dad and Sainted Mother as well as the reconciliatory "This is why we fell in love!" crap that is so often tagged onto the end of these sorts of movies. That consideration alone is worth a couple of stars.<br /><br />No, "Day After Tomorrow" is all about the special effects and action, and is *not* about character development, dialogue, or anything else except swiftly and efficiently killing off the majority of Earth's population. If that's what you watch disaster movies for, like I do, then prepare to be delighted. If, however, you want a lot of yammering dialogue to break up the scenes of everyone being slaughtered by expensive CGI effects, you'll be disappointed in "Day After Tomorrow" and will have to go back and re-watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000G3PA">Armageddon</a>.<br /><br />I really can't think of anything I didn't like about "Day After Tomorrow". The vice president is a realistically callous evil jerk without ever going overboard into pure stupid, there are several cutely humorous scenes that the movie wisely chooses not to belabor too much (including illegal immigration in the opposite direction than usual, and burning tax law books instead of philosophy ones), and the soft science is interesting to watch unfold. The protagonist kids aren't quite as smart as I'd like them to be, but compared to the usual disaster movie crew, they're pure geniuses. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed "Day After Tomorrow" because the characters are so smart (relative to the genre) that even when they do dumb things (like trek to an unknown library to rescue a single kid), they at least do these dumb disaster movie tasks in a smart way. And I appreciate that.<br /><br />I am tempted to give "Day After Tomorrow" five stars, but even the best of disaster movies is still a disaster movie at its heart. There isn't a lot of high drama or deep thoughts to take away from this (well, except "Global Warming is Bad", but surely we know this by now). So, instead, I'll justify giving it 'only' four stars on the grounds that I thought the ending was way too optimistic about humanity's chances and I would have preferred the movie go whole-hog and say that there was really no hope to recover and rebuild, an ending that Hollywood just doesn't seem brave enough to make.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

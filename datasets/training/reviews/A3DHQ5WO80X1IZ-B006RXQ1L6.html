Unfortunately, it did nothing for me (and I tend to actually like musicals!). I can't believe this won all those awards (Best Picture???). It looked great, and the acting was good, but I never gathered any sympathy or empathy with any of the characters, and the music itself didn't do much for me either.</p></body></html>

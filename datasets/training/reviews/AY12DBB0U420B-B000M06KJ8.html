<meta name="summary" content="Visually Stupendous! But, a Somewhat Flawed Movie."></head><body><p>Last night's movie was "Marie Antoinette." I found it on our DVD shelves  and it must have been purchased by my wife at least a few years ago. The movie was interesting, to be sure, but presented a very incongruent mixture. For one, you should expect to just be overcome by the visuals. Magnificent! Stupendous! Totally unreal! Visually, this is one of the best movies I can ever remember watching. It doesn't matter whether it's the French countryside, the French palace and palace grounds, or the elaborately costumed cast, everything about this film is visually overwhelming and the photography is absolutely first rate. This is a movie I could enjoy by turning the sound off and just watching the visuals. It's that good.<br /><br />Then there's the music of the soundtrack. Well, in general it's rather good. There's some excellent classical music and there's a lot of what I might term "French party music" which is also quite good. Either fit the story of the movie quite well. Interspersed with this fine music are a handful of rock 'n' roll selections. Now, don't get me wrong here. Rock 'n' roll includes some of my favorite music and the selections which they chose were quite good. Evidently, someone had good taste. But, this is a 1770 French period piece and everything is done in that fashion, and done quite well. Why include 1980 American rock 'n' roll songs in the soundtrack, good though they might be? It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't help the movie, it disrupts it. Totally incongruent!<br /><br />Then there's the acting. It's stiff and formal. I just never could get into it. None of the people seemed at all real, except, perhaps, Kirsten Dunst in her role as Marie and that was marginal. Her husband was a stiff and wooden figure that I could never develop any empathy for, and that goes for the overwhelming rest of the cast. What goes here? How can they have such a wonderfully costumed cast and then acting that practically no one could relate to? Then there's another problem. Marie was evidently a widely-despised queen. Well, it didn't show at all. She was by far the most likable person in the cast. Then, and it was fortunately not shown in the movie, she was beheaded shortly after the time of the movie. It just doesn't fit her role in the movie. If she's so despicable, why set her up as the most likable person in the movie? It doesn't make sense.<br /><br />In any case, I have a lot of mixed feelings about this movie, both good and bad. It's just a splendid spectacle but could have used a lot of work in the writing and directing, in my opinion. I'd rate the visuals as five stars, no question. But the story, acting and sound track might rate no better than a three. Okay, I'll list it as four stars, but I'd consider it to be a badly flawed movie.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

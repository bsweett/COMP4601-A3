The theme is interesting - possession is something that has fascinated people throughout the history of human beings - and the movie is filmed pretty well - nothing much to complain about. For some reason I just can't bring myself to give it 5 stars though - maybe if I was religous I would find the film more intriguing - as it is I do not find it very frightening - but well done.</p></body></html>

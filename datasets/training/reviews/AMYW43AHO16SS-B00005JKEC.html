<meta name="summary" content="100% Denzel!  Nothing Else!!"></head><body><p>If there was a performance that is equal to some of the most ruthless characters in screen history, then Denzel Washington's Oscar winning performance as L.A. Detective Alonzo Harris is right up there.  He is evil as he is charming.  Washington is clearly enamored by his character and any resemblance to other "goody-two-shoes" performances has been destroyed.  Ethan Hawke also give an Oscar nominated performance as the rookie trying to work the fine line of ethical behavior.  The current climate of the LAPD surely isn't going to help with this film as it's another siering indictment against the police establishment.</p></body></html>

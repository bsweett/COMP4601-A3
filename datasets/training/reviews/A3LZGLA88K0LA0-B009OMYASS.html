<meta name="summary" content="HOSTEL ENVIRONMENT"></head><body><p>HOSTEL comes to us from Eli Roth, the man who also gave us CABIN FEVER.  Like that film, this one spares little when it comes to some gutwrenching gore.  The movie is almost sadistic in its terrifying view of torture and death and dismemberment.<br /><br />Three backpackers in Amsterdam learn from a native about the available girls in Slovakia who will do ANYTHING for money.  On the train, they meet a weird older man whose identity is secretive but he plays an important role in the movie.  Roth wisely keeps the pace slow in the beginning to give us a chance to familiarize ourselves with the trio, but once the bloodletting starts, it's frenetically suspenseful.<br /><br />Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson give very good performances as the two Americans, and one has to question one's own tolerance in viewing such a decadently "sick" film.  However, Roth's goal to disturb and terrify are well delineated and if you like gory horror flicks, this is a good one.</p></body></html>

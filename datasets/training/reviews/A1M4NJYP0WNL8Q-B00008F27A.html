Unlike Evil Dead, the acting pulls off the comedy smoothly, and there is never even a gesture towards being a serious film.  From the moment Ash (Bruce Campbell) is sucked into the infinite and plopped down in a medieval world, chainsaw, shotgun, and all, everything is played for gags, and this time it works.<br /><br />Take a dab from A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, through in an entire host of the undead and you pretty much have the story line.  Ash is dripped into the middle of a battle between Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) and Duke Henry (Richard Grove).  Arthur, the victor, promptly drops Ash in a pit where the undead roam.  Ash gets royally ticked off and makes tiny little pieces of the opposition.  As he crawls out from the hole, the local wiseman (Ian Abercrombie) pronounces him The Promised One, and we are off to the races.<br /><br />Or rather, off to the graveyard, where the local copy of the Necronomicon has made its home.  Managing to forget the words of the releasing spell (klaatu barada nikto) and manages to release the entire deadite army.  But Ash is not to be undone - he wants to go home to his job managing the sporting goods section and it is going to take a whole lot more than a few 1,000 ugly corpses to stop him.<br /><br />As I've said, this film works the best of Director Raimi's series.  In part, I think, because Ash starts out mad, and plays the maniacal cowboy knight to a tee.  In addition, the choreography for the final showdown is excellent, and the script actually has a number of good lines in it.  None of that bad film makes good nonsense here, this was written to be a good film, and it really turned out that way.</p></body></html>

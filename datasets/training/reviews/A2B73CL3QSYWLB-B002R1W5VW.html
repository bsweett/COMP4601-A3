<meta name="summary" content="A Sleeper From Leftfield"></head><body><p>"Matchstick Men" is a film that you think you've got a beat on but takes twists that are clever and make for an ultimately satisfying experience.  The movie introduces us to Roy, a con artist with OCD.  Your first thought is, "uh-oh we're in "Monk" territory".  Then Roy's long lost daughter is introduced into his life and Roy starts to re-evaluate the choices he has made in light of him now being a responsible father.  Just when you thought you've got the rhythms of this movie down twists straight of a David Mamet thriller are thrown into the mix.  Nicolas Cage is superb as Roy and Alison Lohman is his equal as Angela, his long-lost daughter.  Kudos also have to be given to director Ridley Scott here.  Scott is known primarily as a director of big-budget epics and sci-fi thrillers("Thelma and Louise" not withstanding).  It's refreshing to see him succeed in another genre, whatever genre you could categorize this film as.</p></body></html>

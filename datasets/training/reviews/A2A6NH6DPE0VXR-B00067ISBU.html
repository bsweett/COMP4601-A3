<meta name="summary" content="If you want a good time....watch Hellboy!"></head><body><p>Hellboy has to be one of the best experiences I've had at the movies. It's exciting, funny and is the best movie based on a comic since X-Men 2. For a move that is only about an hour and 50 minutes, Guillermo del Toro (Mimic, Blade 2), throws a lot at you in just one movie. The beginning throws so much at you in like 5 minutes that you feel like you just watched a whole movie when it didn't really even start yet. Guillermo del Toro is a director that's great with giving the viewer interesting and scary creatures in all his movies. He knows how to give you the feeling that what your looking at is real. It's too bad that George Lucas isn't letting anyone else direct the prequels because Guillermo del Toro would probably make one awesome StarWars movie. When you see his name there as director you know you're in for a ride. <p>  Anyway Hellboy is about a demon child who is released from a portal in the early 1900's. Nazi's opened the portal trying to bring hell on earth. A scientist finds the demon child and raises him to be good and to fight evil. The child grows up to be Hellboy (Ron Perlman of Blade 2 and City of the Lost Children), a big red demon with broken off horns and an attitude. He has a soft spot however and that soft spot is what keeps him good. He's also in love with a girl who can produce fire (Selma Blair. The movie spends a little too much time with him being jealous that she might have feelings for the new guy on the team though. However Hellboy being jealous is pretty funny and makes for some entertaining scenes so it still works. Ron Perlman is fantastic as him. He's witty, scary and loveable all in one. The movie should not only be seen for the action, cool creatures and del Toro's direction but for Perlman's performance as well.</p></body></html>

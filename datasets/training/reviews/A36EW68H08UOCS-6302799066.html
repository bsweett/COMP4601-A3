<meta name="summary" content="Black Comedy at it's Cold War Best"></head><body><p>Watching the recent funeral and memorial tributes for the late Ronald Reagan speaker after speaker praised the former President for his part in ending the Cold War.  My 18 year old daughter asked me what the Cold War was about.  I tried telling her about the iron curtain and the Berlin Wall and nuclear proliferation, then I realized that I had the perfect movie to demonstrate some of the fears that gripped most of the civilized world while the USA and former Soviet Union had their respective nuclear arsenals aimed at each other.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick took a chance making an over-the-top black comedy about nuclear war, but the payoff is evident.  George C. Scott in a broad comedic farce?  Believe it!  He riffs with Peter Sellers' President Muffley in a way that absolutely must be seen.  Sellers has played comedic madness in many other films, but as President Muffley he is the straight man to Mr. Scott's General Turgidson, who is out of control trying to explain why one of his Base Commanders has ordered all of his B-52's to deliver their nuclear payloads into the Soviet Union in the diabolique "Plan R" - the contingency plan which was put into place to allow lower level military leaders to continue the war after a "sneak attack" had wiped out Washington and the rest of the military big-wigs. Legend has it that Kubrick tricked several of the actors into their performances.  Supposedly George C. Scott didn't know that the film was a satire and played Turgidson straight, and after a few takes Kubrick would say "now let's do one over the top - just for fun", then used only the "over the top" takes in the film.  Legend has it that Scott was mad (who wouldn't be at being tricked) but Kubrick got the right performances into the film.<br /><br />Sellers gives a tour-de-force performance in three roles, and the most interesting one to me is as Group Captain Mandrake, the 2nd in command to Sterling Hayden's deranged General Jack D. Ripper. General Ripper is the kind of paranoid patriot who thinks that "the only good commie is a dead commie", and when I was growing up there were men like this everywhere in America. (Their children grew up to form the Tea Party.) I met some in the service too, and it's not much of a stretch to imagine one becoming a general who would decide to "take the initiative" and begin World War III with a pre-emptive nuclear strike.<br /><br />The other main sub-plot takes place in one of the B-52s that General Ripper has sent off on Plan R.  Slim Pickens is an absolute hoot as the pilot, and finding out later than Kubrick had told Slim that this was a patriotic war film and that Slim was playing "Major Kong" straight makes his performance that much funnier.  Kong's crew play it even straighter than Slim, and as their plane gets closer and closer to dropping the big one there is palpable tension that mounts, ending with one of the most memorable visuals ever as Slim rides the bomb down to it's destination, waving his cowboy hat and hooping and hollering.</p></body></html>

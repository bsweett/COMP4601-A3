It boasts a flashy cast and awesome set decoration, and is an original and watchable comedy that deserves the good-word it's got, and will continue to get.<p>Eighteen years after their sci-fi adventure show &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; was cancelled, actors Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell), and Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub) are making appearances at sci-fi conventions and store openings in costume and character. They're wallowing in despair and at each other's throats until aliens known as Thermians arrive and, having mistook the show for fact and consequently modeling their entire culture around it, take them into space to save them from the genocidal General Sarris and his armada.<p>Galaxy Quest is quite simply one of the funniest movies of recent memory, and although it is pretty much a forgettable movie, it remains a spot-on Star Trek spoof which gets better with every minute. The Thermian's are a laugh, and all the actors are great; especially Sigourney Weaver as Gwen, she really needed that spice, that enchantment and that suit. The make-up for Alan Rickman is stunning and the CGI effects are sometimes stunning.<p>Hilarious and continuously watchable, Galaxy Quest is a fun and adventurous movie which should not be missed by all audiences who just want to have a good time.</p></body></html>

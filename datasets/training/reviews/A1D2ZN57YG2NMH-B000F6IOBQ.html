There are a couple of scenes towards the middle that I found pretty useless (a "nearly nude" sex scene, and then a couple glimpses of a not so discreet one) but these are brief and can be skipped. The writing is tight, the pacing is perfect and the action is downright incredible. I found this movie satisfying and entertaining in every way.<br /><br />(Oh, and kudos to Marco Beltrami on creating a far superior score to Haslinger's original.)</p></body></html>

Zack Snyder has attempted to bring the original story into a new light but in my opinion he fails miserably. The story has changed and the whole concept has been modernized so that the ultimate thrill is found in the updated special effects and new zombie make-up. Sadly even the campy Romero zombies, made-up in the color of sick blueberries, outdo the new zombies. There is just something about slow moving, moaning, flesh-eating dead people, who get to invade a shopping mall and fumble around to "muzak" that just can't be beat. Snyder would have fared better had he chosen to maintain the original film's integrity and storyline.<br /><br />The cast in this film is decent (except for the zombies) with Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phifer, Bruce Bohne and Sarah Polley being the most convincing of the actors. The zombies are scary and somehow very fast and strong in this film but the best make-up only enforces the fact that they are made-up actors. Some scenes in this film are better than many others but none really compare to the original film. The best part of this movie lies in the mystery that takes place during the ending credits....don't switch menus too quickly! Zack Snyder gave it a good try but he hasn't created a classic...that accomplishment can only be attributed to a true master George Romero.</p></body></html>

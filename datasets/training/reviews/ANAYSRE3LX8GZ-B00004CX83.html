<meta name="summary" content="About BATTING time"></head><body><p>FINALLY Warner Bros have released this classic the way it should have been done in the first place for a DVD. I was appauled to find the previous DVD had no bonus features what so ever and wasnt even in surround sound or wide screen.<br /><br />At long last we have the special edition. The movie didnt look all that much touched up, but it does look a bit better. The 5.1 sound is ok, tho, it's not fully 5.1 surround sound.<br /><br />Disc 1 also features a commentary track with Tim Burton... tho, it put me to sleep, so I cant tell you if it was interesting enough to listen to or not.<br /><br />Disc 2 has a bunch of stuff thats in some ways a bit disapointing, and yet other bits are interesting. The first thing is a HISTOY OF THE DARK KNIGHT feature, it goes for about 30 mins and shows the history and changed Batman has had over the the last 60 years. Starting from the origons with Bob Kane and showing the development of it all over the years up to the Cartoon series of the 90's.<br /><br />There is unfortunalty not very much of any behind the scenes of the movie. The Feturette showed more of Bob Kane talking about the movie then actualy showing the movie. There is also some bits and peices of the development team making the Batmobile, Batsuit and a bunch of things like that.<br /><br />What disapointed me is there is no deleted scenes. HOWEVER, there is a very interesting thing that shows the story board of a scene that did not get filmed, but intended to have a suprise glimpse of the boy wonder!!!!<br /><br />There is a few more things, but overall, i may be a bit disapointed with the features, which makes me wonder if this is just the Special Edition that is going to be replaced with a 3 disc Ultimate edition in 6 months.<br /><br />Still, over all, its about bloody time they released this propperlly, the way it shoudl have been done years ago.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Visionary and inventive...much better than I expected!"></head><body><p>Some of my children are real Tim Burton fans, e.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C3L27U">Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (Widescreen Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00447L4JG">Nightmare Before Christmas</a>, but to be frank I haven't been that interested.<br /><br />This evening my 11-yr old daughter invited me to watch Burton's version of "Alice in Wonderland", so we sat down and watched it together.  I must admit that I went into the experience with low expectations, but was soon drawn into the story.  Without giving anything away, I saw parallels between the tradtional story and Burton's, even before Alice went down the rabbit hole to "Underland."  That made it fun.<br /><br />It wasn't long before I saw that this version is a sequel to the original tale, and that was fun too.<br /><br />The imagery was classic Tim Burton...the shapes of the trees, etc., just oozed Burton through and through, and, of course, everything was mostly dark and dreary...again, Burton-esque.<br /><br />Burton's development of the story on screen was inventive and visionary, combining live action and aminated components to weave the tale.<br /><br />So, in the end I was engaged and interested all the way through...surprising myself with that!<br /><br />All in all I'd say that I liked it very much, though I wouldn't say that I loved it.  Even so, it's highly watchable, mainly for viewers over the age of 10 or so, but not for young children...at least that's where I'd pitch it.  There are a few somewhat gruesome scenes, but nothing I'd call gory.<br /><br />This is a a solid 4-star offering for me...a 50+ dad who likes a wide variety of movies.  This is one that can be enjoyed by viewers of different generations.</p></body></html>

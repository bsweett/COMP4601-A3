A finely crafted piece of filmmaking, with stunning performances throughout, never before have I seen an account of WWII that is so vibrantly horrifying.  The portrait of Hitler is particularly mesmerizing - the account rendered in this film paints the picture of a wildly maniacal sociopath with human touches - even traces of warmth.  This juxtaposition was, for me, a powerful one, and offered perhaps the first ever film biography of the most notorious killer of modern history that feels believable. And this film captures Eva Braun with a raw intensity - you actually have a sense of who she might have been.  And the loyalty of Hitler's henchmen - and his countrymen - is painted as so complete that it underscores the audacity of what this man actually did to the world.  A first-class, exceptional film that will have you riveted.  Beware - there are multiple scenes of graphic violence, not to mention ghastly atrocities that are so specific and personal that, in some ways, they are worse than the mass murders we've seen portrayed in other WWII films.</p></body></html>

I enjoyed all three of the original trilogy films back in the 80s & early 90s, and was hoping they would be able to end the series with a blockbuster story.  Unfortunately, this was just not to be.<br /><br />This IJ movie picks up in 1957 and as such it taps into some of the more noteworthy aspects of that time, such as the Red Scare / McCarthyism and nuclear bomb testing (I never knew that refrigerators provided such protection against nukes!).<br /><br />The central theme of the film, however, revolves around the infamous E.T. incident at Roswell New Mexico that has received so much press the past 60 years.  Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005V9IK">Independence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>, the story also indulges into the associated mythology of little green men being held at AREA 51.<br /><br />As an adventure film, this is roughly as well done as the first three, albeit with some action sequences which go well beyond the realm of believability.  Harrison Ford is back, Karen Allen reprises her role from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)</a> (and she has aged quite well, I might add!) and  Shia LaBeouf is a good young up-and-coming actor.  While the identity of LaBeouf's role is pretty predictable, it is still a worthwhile addition to the IJ storyline.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that I found the plot rather....well....hokey.  Once you get into the "This stuff is too advanced to have been crafted by humans.  Must have been aliens!" motif, then everything becomes very silly very quickly.  Having occult stuff and Hindu stuff in IJ movies is great fun, but to summon space aliens just isn't very Indy like.<br /><br />Ultimately, this movie struck me as a cross between a cross between an IJ movie and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VECAD0">Close Encounters of the Third Kind (30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition)</a>.  While I enjoy both the adventure movie & science fiction genres, it's just not a good thing to try & combine the two (in my opinion, at least).  It's kind of like putting ketchup on your ice cream;  you may enjoy both, but.....</p></body></html>

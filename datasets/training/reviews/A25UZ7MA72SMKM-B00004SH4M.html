Made in the 'good old days', when they could film a Bond movie each year and have a hit every time! It is also the container for the most provocatively named of all 'Bond girls', Pussy Galore. Fleming dreamed up a few of these not so sly double entendres, but this one was REALLY out there. LOL This movie was the first Bond film to change locales around the world several times, moving from Miami to England to Europe and then to Kentucky.<br /><br />The manner of death of some of the villains is a bit altered from the book, but for a film adaptation of a novel Goldfinger stays very true to the original story.<br /><br />Sadly, the battle between Goldfinger's forces and the troops stationed at Fort Knox presage a sad development in Bond climaxes as the series progressed.<br /><br />Very enjoyable, Bond is still more of a spy than a commando, sit back and appreciate it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Weak plot"></head><body><p>I never saw the 1951 classic, so I won't compare this film to that one. As other reviewers have noted, this version has good special effects. However, the plot seemed empty. The movie is nominally about an alien who wants to destroy the human race because we haven't taken care of it (presumably because of deforestation, global warming, etc). Yet, the film mostly tracks the story of Jennifer Connelly (an astrobiologist) and Keanu Reeves (Klaatu the alien). For a film supposedly about humanity, this seems a rather narrow focus and neither actor is powerful enough to carry humanity on his or her own. It would have been better to develop a plot that incorporated a wide range of actors to make it more about humanity and less about Jennifer Connelly. Granted, the film has entertainment value, but it's mere sci-fi adventure whereas the concept has much more potential. I'm just thankful there was no inter-galactic love connection between Connelly and Reeves' characters.</p></body></html>

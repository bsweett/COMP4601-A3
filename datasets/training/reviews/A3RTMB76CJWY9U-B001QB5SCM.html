<meta name="summary" content="Women, Talking About Feelings; Not a Story to be Found"></head><body><p>Yuck.<br /><br />Despite good acting by talented performers, and the always-strong appeal of long shots on Cameron Diaz' legs, this is a tiresome movie, too-long by almost half. It suffers from a lack of story.<br /><br />It's a chronicle of two very different sisters. You might think the tale has them interact until they learn valuable lessons from one another, or something like that. However, the movie splits them up and has them experience their own "adventures." Shoes play no *real* role in the tale, if you were thinking they might, nor is anyone forced to "live anyone else's life" in anyway. In fact, there's nothing really consequential going on... just characters living their lives. It all winds up feeling like a memoir--a woman's reminisciences of "me and my sister," without an editor's eye for the necessary features of good cinema, like plot.<br /><br />What plot there is feels contrived--yeah, sure, the high-powered lawyer gives up her job to take up dog-walking without a moment's difficulty or regret, and the whorish sneak-thief blends right in to a retirement community and parlays it into a successful entrepreneurship. Makes perfect sense.<br /><br />There's no real change in the main character (Toni Collette): her attitude is basically the same at the end as it is at the beginning--"I love my sister, no matter what." The only real change to her is that she finds a good relationship, but that takes place completely externally, not on the inside.<br /><br />Other plotlines and relationships are strewn across the stage haphazzardly--each of the sisters' relationship with their grandmother, with their father, with their stepmother, with their stepsister, with their deceased mother. Nothing ever comes together, here, just a lot of venting of feeling, pointless characterization, and schmaltzy "feel-good" moments that come almost out of nowhere.<br /><br />Bad, poorly written, cinema.</p></body></html>

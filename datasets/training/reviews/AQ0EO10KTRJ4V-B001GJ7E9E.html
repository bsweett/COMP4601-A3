<meta name="summary" content="The joke wears thin"></head><body><p>Any movie that relies on a single "punchline" or a "One trick pony" for a full 2 hours usually wears thin and this is no exception.<br /><br />By about 55 minutes my wife and I were saying to each other..... "OK, this has gotten old already".<br /><br />I have to admit though we liked Brad Pitt in this movie which was surprising since we have never thought much of anything he has done since Interview with a Vampire.<br /><br />He is one of those popular actord who you always wonder why he is such a press magnet since most of his films have been medicore.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="END FOR INDY"></head><body><p>Wow, you know when Speilberg misses he really misses.  Im in my thirties so I grew up on Indiana Jones and I was really jazzed that they were making a new one...uh until I saw the finished product that is.  Harrison Ford, geritol love him, does his very best, and frankly he is by far and away the best thing about this movie.  Let me state right off, I am no fan of Shia LaBouef, I just dont get his popularity at all, and he is totally miscast in this film, and lord, Cate Blachette is just as bad, that accent is hilarious.  Really, I cant state strongly enough how disappointed I was in this film, if it had not been for my love of Harrison Ford, I would have given it one star.  Hopefully, this is the last Indy, it's just a shame it had to end on such a lackluster film..Professor Jones deserved better, hellz I deserved better..really I want my money back..hummm..wonder who I contact.</p></body></html>

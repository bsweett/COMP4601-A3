<meta name="summary" content="Disgustingly Entertaining - A Wild Ride!"></head><body><p>Taken from the `Hellblazer' comic book series, "Constantine" is a horrific, sickening, fun, campy, gore fest.  Keanu Reeves plays his regular wooden self helping Rachel Weisz try to save the hell-bound fate of her twin sister who committed suicide.  He has special powers to rid demons from earth and spends most of his time walking through the movie coughing up the results of years of smoking.  The story is simply Reeves trying to balance good and evil between God and Satan on earth.  He seeks out those old good-evil, angel-devil half breeds.  Some of his encounters are digitally amazing.  The story is mildly entertaining, but the effects are truly inspiring, if not nauseatingly inventive.  Reeves makes frequent trips to hell and the scenery is spectacular.  Tilda Swinton also makes a cameo as angel Gabriel who tells Reeves that basically, he is f***ed!  It's half funny and half scary. It is not a pleasant movie, but is nothing short of pure entertainment.  Not for young kids by any measure!</p></body></html>

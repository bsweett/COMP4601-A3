<meta name="summary" content="Good But Deep"></head><body><p>Take a rat, add lots of wild and dangerous chase scenes, add a few recipes, finish off with a message that may be too deep for children and you might wind up with this film.  This film is somewhere in the middle of Pixar's output.  It is not the best but not the worst.<br />Our rat is unusual.  He does not like the standard rat diet of garbage.  He has a refined palette which his family exploits to check for poison.  But he is unhappy.  A violent episode lands him in Paris where he finds the restaurant of his chef hero.  Here he has adventures with avoiding the staff and trying to cook.  Add two villains (yes, two), the restaurant's current owner and a food critic and our rat's life gets very complicated.<br />This is a long film with much of it taken up by chase scenes.  The cooking scenes are fun and clever.  But in the middle we have the lone rat who does not fit in with other rats or with people as he keeps trying to be what he is not in order to please others.  It is only in the end when he finds a way to be true to himself that things begin to go well.  Great message but a little out there for the kids.  The understood the message in Cars and The Incredibles but they didn't quite get this one as it a more adult problem.  Still, it has plenty of the tings kids like while being intelligent enough for adults.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="At The Crossroads"></head><body><p>The symbolic ending of this movie finds Tom Hanks at the dusty crossroads of a small town in Texas after returning to his job as a FedEx worker.<br /> Four years prior to this, he survived a plane crash that left him stranded in the South Pacific and presumed dead by family, friends, and colleagues.<br /> The years spent on that primitive isle are realistically boring and lonely for him. Viewers watch as a soccer ball with his bloody imprints becomes his best friend, his hair grows long, wild, and sun-bleached, and he grows mentally ill.<br /> By the time he is able to build a raft and finally free himself from his island prison, we realize how much Wilson has come to mean to him, and how Wilson has come to symbolize the human contact that Chuck so desperately craves.<br /> We feel sad that his wife, Kelly, played by Helen Hunt, didn't pay attention to her gut instincts about whether or not her husband had survived, and instead listened to friends who told her to move on with her life.<br /> This film reminds me a little of &quot;Forever Young&quot;, except that the ending leaves us hanging regarding the ultimate fate of the hero. But we know that at least now that he is back in civilization, his destiny is back in his own hands, and we wish him all the best.</p></body></html>

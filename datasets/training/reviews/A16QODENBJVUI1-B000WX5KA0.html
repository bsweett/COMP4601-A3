<meta name="summary" content="One of the greatest performances not to win an Oscar"></head><body><p>Robert De Niro's performance in TAXI DRIVER remains, after twenty-five years, one of the most powerful ever witnessed in an American film.  It is almost shocking today that he didn't win the Oscar for Best Actor.  The reason isn't hard to locate.  Just as Shirley MacLaine lost in 1960 to Elizabeth Taylor when Academy voters thought the latter might be dying (obviously, she survived), so Robert De Niro lost in 1976 when Peter Finch, who had been nominated for NETWORK, actually died.  I liked Finch in NETWORK, but today his performance seems to pale beside that of De Niro's.  In addition to Henry Fonda's mythic performance as Tom Joad in THE GRAPES OF WRATH, it is almost inconceivable that his performance was not acknowledged at the time.<p>De Niro is in very nearly every scene in this film, and without a stunning performance in that role, you do not get a stunning film.  Luckily, De Niro is unforgettable.  Although his famous scene in front of the mirror (the "You talking to me" scene, which was entirely improvised) is rightfully celebrated, in every second of the film his presence dominates.  I seem to remember reading years ago in an interview with screenwriter Paul Schrader that Travis Bickle was based very much on the narrator from Dostoevsky's NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND.  If he didn't say that, I will.  It isn't just that Travis seems socially out of place, but morally and metaphysically out of place.  He doesn't seem to be a person with a genuine core, and at the end of the film, he seems equally capable of good or evil.  He ends up doing good, but Scorsese has pointed to the arbitrariness of his actions.  He could easily have assassinated the political candidate instead of the pimp.  He ends the movie a hero, but an more an ironic hero than an anti-hero.  In a flip of a metaphysical coin, he accidentally ends up a good guy instead of a madman.<p>In a way, this film is a group effort, with tremendous performances by Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster, and a tremendous score by the legendary Bernard Herrmann (CITIZEN KANE, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, PSYCHO).  But the main credit for this film should go jointly to De Niro, Scorsese, and Paul Schrader.  Unbelievably, neither Scorsese nor Schrader even received an Oscar nomination.  This, of course, says a lot more about the inherent conservatism of the Academy than about the job these men did.  In fact, most of the greatest directors to work in American cinema (Hitchcock, Ernst Lubitsch, Howard Hawks, Preston Sturges, Orson Welles, among many others) never won a Best Director Oscar, and neither has Scorsese.  And very few better, more literate scripts have been produced in America.  <p>I'm writing here on the assumption that anyone reading this has seen this film, probably more than once.  If that isn't the case, this truly is one of the greatest American films.  It is a landmark film, showing the ferocity and loneliness that many find in modern life in a way that has only rarely been portrayed in any art form, whether cinema or literature.  To say that it is a "must see" film doesn't do it justice.</p></body></html>

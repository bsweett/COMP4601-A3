It has intense fight scenes, wonderful graphics, terrific quotes, and a lot of feeling, danger, evil and determination. Here is how the story goes-There is a new cop on a team in Detroit. His name is Alex J Murphy. Dick Jones, the leader of this cop department, who is actually a bad guy wanting to create cop machines that are really killers. Meanwhile, Anne Lewis and Alex are starting to be friends, when a ruthless and notorious cop killer named Clarence Boddicker is hired by Dick Jones to take Murphy out. With the help of his gang, he succeeds, but Murphy is brought back to life by doctors who make him part man, part machine. He is amazingly strong and almost indestructible, and has all sorts of weapons from guns to hand spikes. He is dubbed Robocop, and in no time proves worthy as he trashes all sorts of criminals, saves all sorts of lives and protects Detroit. However, the memories of Clarence Boddicker and how he took his ordinary life away from him makes Robocop want not only justice for others, but also revenge for himself. He soon finds Clarence after plowing through some of his gang, fights him and arrests him. Clarence gets free, though, and talks to Dick, who he makes a plan with to crush Robocop once and for f**king all. Clarence and his remaining gang attack Robocop and Lewis, who is with him and is the only human he'll listen to, at a large construction site. Soon, most of Clarence's gang is dead, and only he and one more member remain. While Robocop moves in, intent on killing Clarence and ending his menace forever, he is dropped on by a lot of metal bars released by Clarence's last henchman, who gets blown to bits along with the building he's in while he and his boss cheer, by Anne Lewis' rocket launcher, no less. Now, Clarence is on his own, but it seems like that doesn't matter, as he sticks a metal spike into Robocop's chest and injures him badly. However, even if Clarence can fend for himself with weapons, what he did to Robocop is still nothing compared to what Robocop does to him. He extends the spike on his hand I mentioned earlier and to say it nicely Robocop gives Clarence the Hector treatment. After Clarence is destroyed, he takes Anne with him to get medical treatment, and then goes for Dick Jones at the police headquarters. After revealing Dick's betrayal, Robocop can't attack as Dick threatens an old but important bossman with a gun and will kill him unless given an escape helicopter. But the old man and Robocop have the last laugh. Despite his age, the man's in good shape and he breaks Dick's hold and says: "You're fired!" And so, Dick Jones meets his demise as Robocop fills him full of bullets and he crashes out a window, falling thousands of feet to the rock hard pavement. Robocop tells the others he is Murphy and the movie ends. This is among the best movies I have ever seen. It gets a solid and gold 10 out of 10 and I recommend it to anyone who likes fighting films.</p></body></html>

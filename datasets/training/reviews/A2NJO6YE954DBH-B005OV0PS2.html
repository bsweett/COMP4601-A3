<meta name="summary" content="Will the Dude ever figure out what is going on here?"></head><body><p>Jeff Bridges does not play the title role in &quot;The Big Lebowski.&quot;  Bridges plays the Dude; David Huddleston plays the Big Lebowski, a rich guy with a young trophy wife named Bunny (Tara Reid).  The problem is that the Dude and the Big Lebowski have the same name, which explains why when Bunny runs up debts the moronic pair sent to collet money from her husband end up at the house of the wrong Lebowski.  From that moment on the Dude's life gets very confusing and he is clearly the person least capable of dealing with this confusion of anybody in the greater Los Angeles area,<p>&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is only disappointing because it is the first film the Coen Brothers came out with after &quot;Fargo.&quot;  When you make a masterpiece it is hard to follow-up with something equally strong.  Even &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; suffers in comparison to &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; and whatever happened to the guy who made &quot;Titanic&quot;?  However, if &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; came out after &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; nobody would have batted an eye.  Not just because they both deal with a kidnapping that may or may not be a kidnapping, but also because the Coen Brothers have rounded up many of the usual familiar faces from their other films for this endeavor.<p>There are two main questions in this film.  The first is &quot;What is going on?&quot;  Repeatedly the Dude sits down and explains to his friends Walter (John Goodman) and/or Donny (Steve Buscemi) what he thinks is going on, or Walter takes a stab at it, and the odds are that sooner or later they are going to get it right.  Just do not put money down on it.  The second is what, if anything, the Dude will have left at the end of this meandering story.  You get the feeling that chances are neither the Dude nor his car are going to get out of this one alive and that his friends are as much a threat to the Dude (and his car) as the growing number of enemies who keep popping up through the festivities.  If only the Dude did not own a rug that really pulled his apartment together, then he might have been spared a lot of pain and frustration.  <p>&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is a film that will grow on you, especially once you get atuned to the idea that the Dude is trying to keep his life together, the same way his beloved rug pulled together his apartment.  Even a misfire by the Coens is going to have some memorable moments and every film they make certainly has a chance to be on the level of "Raising Arizona" and "Fargo," so even their second tier efforts are worth watching.</p></body></html>

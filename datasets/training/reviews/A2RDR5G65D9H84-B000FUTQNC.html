<meta name="summary" content=""Oh my God, what you do want?""></head><body><p>After a promising start, this film loses its way and ends up being a slightly below average thriller. The premise is definitely intriguing: a group of men holds hostage the family of the VP of Security of a bank and want him to transfer $100 million from various accounts into their offshore egg nest, in exchange for his family safety. The problem is that after establishing the basic premise, the story gets convoluted and quickly moves towards the realm of the unbelievable, with some situations that are pretty unreal.<br /><br />Harrison Ford plays the role of Jack, the bank's employee whose family is kidnapped, and he does a fairly good job with the elements he has at his disposal. The fact that some of the scenes are borderline silly is not his fault. Paul Bettany is very convincing in his role as a villain, and he manages to draw some hate from the audience with his portrayal of the leader of the thieves. The rest of the members of the cast do not deserve much praise, and I was especially disappointed by the overdone emotions infused to her character by Virginia Madsen.<br /><br />Those people that do not mind when a movie has farfetched situations may enjoy this movie more than I did. However, I think that even these people will have to agree that there are many better thrillers available in the market. This one should get a pass.</p></body></html>

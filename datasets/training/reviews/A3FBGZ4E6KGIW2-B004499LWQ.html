This is about cheating, deception..a powerful story put onto film.  The acting in this movie was incredible.  I felt along with each one of the characters, one of the best performances on here has to be Clive Owen's, Natalie Portman has made an improvement since Garden State (which I didn't care for) I think this deserves that Golden Globe and those Academy Award nominations.  It's a solid film.  Worth a rental for sure, but I would just go buy it right away.  It's worth it.  I would rate this more like four and a half stars, but they won't allow that on here.  The only reason why is because there wasn't anything in the DVD extras, only a music video and previews.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Burton back on top with retelling of classic"></head><body><p>I was totally disinterested in seeing this movie until I saw the preview at the El Capitan. Visually, this movie had me hooked immediately! Lush (yet dark), detailed, and full of wonderful imagery, it was a feast for the eyes. The movie itself didn't disappoint, and neither did this blu-ray version. Rather than retell the previously oft-filmed tale, Burton picks up where the other two Lewis Carroll tales ended and gives us an exploration of Alice's emotional state as she transitions from childhood to adulthood. Alice's father has passed on, and she is about to be proposed to by an extremely nerdy (but wealthy) Lord. Unsure that this is the future that she wants, escapes the engagement party by following the white rabbit and promptly falling into a rabbit hole to find herself in Underland. Much darker than the Wonderland we are used to, Underland is held hostage by the evildoings of The Red Queen. Waiting for Alice to find her "muchness" and rescue it, The Mad Hatter and The White Queen have waited a long time for her to return. Will Alice be up to the task of leading The White Queen's Army to save Underland?<br /><br />It is a lot of fun along the way with fantastic performances by the Tim Burton troupe of actors that you usually find in his flicks: Johnny Depp (a perfectly fresh interpretation of The Mad Hatter, thus redeeming himself from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BBOUU4">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>), Helena Bonham Carter (practically steals the show as The Red Queen), Crispin Glover (characteristically dark, quirky, and evil as The Knave of Hearts), and Anne Hathaway (showing her acting versatility as The White Queen). With all of the talent surrounding her, it is a testimony to the talent of Mia Wasikowska (Alice) that she is able to act without getting swallowed up and upstaged by the others.<br /><br />There are plenty of special effects and computer graphics here, but the fantastic part is that one only notices the beauty of the film and the wonderfully wacky characters. The mood of the film is enhanced by the music of Danny Elfman.<br /><br />As for the quality of the blu-ray transfer, it is superb. Just as in the theater, the computer graphics are well rendered and the picture is rich (albeit dark because of the tone of the film) and the sound is rich and robust.<br /><br />3-Disc Combo Pack comes with Blu-ray with feature and extras, a DVD copy with feature and extras, and a Digital Copy of Feature Film.<br /><br />SPECS:<br />Video: 1080p High Def 1:78.1<br />Audio: English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48Hz/24-bit); English 2.0 DVS, French & Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround * Subtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />BONUS FEATURES (Video: 1080p High Def or 480i * Audio: English 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital * Subtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish)<br /><br />Sneak Previews: Tinker Bell promotes the Blu-ray format, Disney Movie Rewards ad, Beauty & The Beast Diamond Edition (Blu-ray), James & The Giant Peach Special Edition (Blu-ray), Fantasia Diamond Edition (Blu-ray), Disney Parks ad, Family Blu-ray & Combo Packs Ad, The Sorcerer's Apprentice with Nic Cage trailer, Tinker Bell & The Great Fairy Rescue, and an Anti-Smoking ad!<br /><br />Featurettes:<br /><br />Although not overly long, they were a fantastic look into the making of the film, with all of the major participants being interviewed, including Johnny Depp, Crispin Glover, Danny Elfman, and the rest of the gang.<br /><br />Wonderland Characters (27:56)<br /><br />1. Finding Alice: Talks about Alice's emotional journey as she learns to embrace her courage and matures into womanhood.<br /><br />2. The Mad Hatter: Depp talks about how The Mad Hatter has been frozen in time, waiting for Alice to return. Interesting to hear how he developed his characterization. Both he and Burton independently made sketches of how they thought the character should look. Very cool to see them side-by-side!<br /><br />3. The Futterwacken: This is the one part of the movie I thought was lame. Still, the guy who did the dance for Depp (yup, just found out it wasn't Depp who actually danced in the movie! As he states, "Another man futterwacked for me!") is very talented. He was found through a clip on Youtube!<br /><br />4. The Red Queen: Carter obviously relished this role (even though she lost her voice daily from the loudness of her character). The combination of villainy and childlike petulance actually makes her somewhat endearing, and she pulls it off marvelously. Carter also loved the props--the glasses, the scepter. These were actual props (not CG) that helped her with her characterization.<br /><br />5. Time Lapse: Sculpting the Red Queen: 3 hours each day in the makeup chair! See it all come together.<br /><br />6. The White Queen: Hathaway's performance was an unexpected treat. Depp states, "She made me jealous--I wanted to play the White Queen." Burton let Hathaway show a little darkness and "explore the off-side of someone who is supposed to be good." Hathaway herself says that her character is "A little ditsy, but very clued in--kind of a Norma Desmond thing."<br /><br />Making Wonderland (19:28)<br />1. Scoring Wonderland: Danny Elfman collaborates again with Tim Burton (for about the 12th time). You'll want to listen closely to the music on the next viewing after listening to Elfman talk about how and why he created some of the eerie vocal choruses in the film.<br /><br />2. Effecting Wonderland: Tim Burton relates how the cast had to feel like they were in the real AND the unreal world. Really amazing what a fantastic job all the actors did, especially considering that many of the costumes, sets, and more were done post-production on the computer. The film is a melding of CG, motion capture, and live action. Interesting to see how the Red Queen's head is enlarged. This is all way beyond my comprehension of how they figured it out and then kept track of all this stuff!<br /><br />3. Stunts of Wonerland: Garrett Warren (stunt coordinator) discusses how he read the script and had to break down each scene into what would need stunts and how they would be done. Shows green-screen filming of Mia as Alice as she tumbles down the rabbit hole.<br /><br />4. Making The Proper Size: Tells of the frustration experienced by Mia when having to be different sizes in the film, acting towards different site lines since most of the size change was done post-filming on a computer.<br /><br />5. Cakes of Wonderland: Made by the Cake Divas (Joan Spitler and Leigh Grode), even this tiny detail was given much attention. They researched and then baked items that would be found at a Victorian Tea Party. The table had to be reset 12 times! And yes, the "Eat Me" cake was truly edible, as Alice had to bite into it for filming 32 times.<br /><br />6. Tea Party Props: details the decor on the Mad Hatter's tea party. The look is inspired by what one would expect at a wartime tea or the great depression. Much work had to go into this scene, as 3 of everything had to be made in addition to breakaway pieces for the destruction. In all, there were about 150 pieces to manage and keep track of.<br /><br />OVERALL: HIGHLY recommended!</p></body></html>

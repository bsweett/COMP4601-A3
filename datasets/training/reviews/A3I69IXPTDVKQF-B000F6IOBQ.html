Visually stunning, sexy, action-packed, and imaginative in the looks for its slowly growing line-up of creatures, it's a horror thrill ride that makes it worthwhile to overlook a few missteps.<br /><br />  Beginning about 800 years ago to reveal the full origin of both the vampire and Lycan (werewolf) clans, it then flashes forward to the present day, picking up very shortly after the ending of the first movie.  With the vampire hierachy shaken to its foundations and the clans in disarray, Selene and Michael are on the run from a slew of potential enemies, quickly hopping from safehouse to safehouse.  Marcus, the third of the elder vampires (and apparantly most dangerous, capable of shifting into an awesome monsterous form with massive, taloned wingtips that can impale his adversaries) is awakened and fills the role of main villain in the movie.  He pursues Selene because her position as the 'adopted daughter' of Viktor has, in a fashion that's explained later in the film, some kind of connection to an ancient plot that Marcus has been waiting centuries to put into play.  In the chaos following the first movie's finale, Marcus seizes on the opportunity to finally track down and free the original werewolf from its prison.<br /><br />  One thing wrong is that "Underworld: Evolution" feels too rushed; there's too much packed into its 106-minute running time.  What I really would like to see (and actually wouln't be surpised to see happen close to the release of a third Underworld movie, if one comes out) is a release of an Extended Edition - 25 or 30 minutes longer, ideally - of Underworld Evolution come out.  Close to half an hour is about what I figure it would take to balance the pacing and give it a chance to develop some points that felt shortened.  I wouldn't be surprised if this was originally longer anyway, and got cut down because studios are still shy about releasing very many theatrical movies that go much over two hours.<br /><br />  Another problem - and I hate to admit this one because I really loved "Underworld: Evolution" - is that there are a few parts that just plain don't make sense.  For example, after a major blow-out at a restaurant against Marcus, (where there's even a large police prescence) Selene and Michael flee the scene in a truck and end up taking refuge in an old warehouse that appears to be only a few miles from the site of the altercation.  Now, I realize dawn was breaking and they had to take any refuge available because Selene burns in sunlight.  But once there, they seem completely unconcerned that it might be easy for the police or anyone else to find where they'd holed up (or maybe not so easy, since no one does).  Instead the movie goes forward into more romantic territory very quickly at this point.  Now, that part was welcome, but if the film had been longer, there could have been a more realistic, 'cornered/on-guard' atmosphere where the two are trying to devise a way to get a better distance away in the daylight hours; and then had the exact same romantic scenes from the warehouse take place somewhere else, safer.  There are a couple other instances where things like this just don't seem consistent.<br /><br />  The acting, while good, isn't quite on par with the first one either, although there a number of truly impressive performances, including by Kate Beckinsale as Selene and by Derek Jacobi as a previously unseen Immortal from before the time of the first vampires and Lycans.  It's hard to compare Scott Speedman (Michael)'s performance with his great turn in the first one because he doesn't get as much screen time here; maybe they'll beef up his role in either the third film or an extended version of this one.  The action sequences are superb, and the special effects excellent.<br /><br />  If there is a third movie, I'll repeat what I said when I did a writeup for the first one: we've got new spins on vampires and werewolves here; I really think the filmmakers would do well to consider adding a third breed of monster (goblins, zombies, whatever) and trying to do something really fresh and original with them too.<br /><br />  Overall "Underworld: Evolution" is a great action horror movie, ones that fans of the first one can't afford to miss, even though it requires some suspension of disbelief.  Definately good enough to buy and not just rent.</p></body></html>

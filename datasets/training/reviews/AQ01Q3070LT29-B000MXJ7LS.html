<meta name="summary" content="Policemen's two-man story of September 11, 2001."></head><body><p>Released by Paramount, August 9, 2006.<br />  Director Oliver Stone was very careful not to film the horrible scenes of September 11, 2001 we have already seen many times on the news.  You will not see any scenes of the crashes, not the impact which is already subliminally in our mind.  Stone shows only a shadow of a plane and then a sound effect followed by people's reaction.Their is nothing offensive in this film.  The action and hydrinoline is quite toned down.  Their is no mention of the Middle East or the politics in this film.<br />  The movie mostly focuses on two New York City Port Authority policemen played by Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena pinned under the rubble.<br />  The real-life policemen and survivors John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno make a cameo appearance. Will Jimeno is seen several times in the film. He iss the Port Authority Officier who says "Sarg" as Nicholas cage runs towards the group with papers flying outside, and is seen hugging actor, Michael Pena at end of film. Nicholas Cage shakes hands with John McLoughlin.<br />  For those who care, this film might make a lump in your throat. The scenes of the men down in the rubble really put you there.<br />  Some people have become cynical, but their are many stories that could be told here about 9/11.  This story has a good ending.<br />  Only 20 people were found alive in the World Trade Center Towers rubble.<br />  Also in the cast: Jay Hernandez as "Dominick Pezzulo", Danny Nucci as "Officier Giraldi", Stoney Westmoreland as "Paddy McGee". Patti D'Arbanville, Dorothy lyman, Donna Murphy, jay Acovone, Stephen Dorff.<br /> DVD is available in Widescreen, Fullscreen, single disc, 2-disc, HD, Blu-ray.<br /> Two audio commentaries: #1  Director, Oliver Stone.<br />The best audio commentary and the only one of its kind:<br /> Retired Police Officier and survivor, Will Jimeno.<br /> Police Officier/Emergency Unit, Scott Strauss.<br /> Police Officier/Tactic Paramedic, John Bushing.<br /> Police Officier/Emergency Unit. Paddy MGee.<br />  With this audio commentary option "on', these brave men will discuss the real live events as the movie is playing. Will Jimeno will discuss his time trapped with John and Dominick and some things not filmed for the movie.<br />  In real-life , Will and John's ordeal lasted 26 hours long trapped and pinned under concrete, smoke and fire. It took three hours to free Will after he was found. John had to wait until daylight alone until a resuer could get to him.</p></body></html>

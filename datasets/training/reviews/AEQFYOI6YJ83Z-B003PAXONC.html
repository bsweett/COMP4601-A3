<meta name="summary" content="Not a faithful adaptation, but a good enough film on its own"></head><body><p>I am going to start with a disclaimer, aimed towards fans of Matheson's book: This is not what you would call a "faithful" adaptation.  Matheson's novel was more of a social commentary (as was most of his work, including his several "Twilight Zone" episodes and movie screenplays), with an ending that left readers no doubt that he was reaching beyond the realm of science fiction and horror.  This movie...not so much.<br /><br />The film must be judged on its own merits.  Fortunately, it holds up.  I was skeptical--as soon as I heard they were putting Will Smith in a production of "I Am Legend," I balked.  Vincent Price pulled it off in "The Last Man on Earth;" I've never seen the Charlton Heston version ("The Omega Man"), so I can't judge it.  But Will Smith?  Don't get me wrong, he's a great action hero.  But this isn't--or, rather, wasn't--an action story.  So...again...Will Smith?<br /><br />Well, he pulls it off.  He probably could even have pulled off a faithful adaptation; the first half shows so much potential, I think he could've gone all the way.  As is, as soon as the cheesy computer-animated monsters come in, it becomes something more of a shoot-em-up.  In fact, I'm willing to bet you that there are two good reasons for watching this movie: the scenery (my God, it'll take your breath away), and Will Smith.  Well, also the dog.  And, if you've heard about the scene that's not good for dog lovers...well, you're right.  I didn't think it would shake me much, but it did.  Kudos to the film-makers; that's probably the one scene in here that SHOULD'VE been in the Matheson novel.<br /><br />So, for those doubters out there, I suggest watching the film.  If you're a Richard Matheson fan, go into it with a grain or two of salt, please, and judge the film on its own merits.  It still isn't a GREAT movie, no; it could've been, I think, had they stuck to the novel.  They digressed, however, and what we have here is a slightly-better-than-average popcorn flick, with vampire/zombie hybrid things.  And Bob Marley.</p></body></html>

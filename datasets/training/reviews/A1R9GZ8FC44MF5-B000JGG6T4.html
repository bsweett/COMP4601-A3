<meta name="summary" content="Tony Scott painted himself a masterpiece."></head><body><p>Though certainly not one of the greatest films ever made its still a great film.  Denzel deserves an oscar nom but i think Jesus will win, Dakota is also very good in this movie and might get herself a nom, just goes to show kids CAN ACT.  The story is well done and the dialogue is great.  The style is original and adds a little more to the movie(though sometimes that zooming and spazing get a little annoying), the music is sometimes off for the mood of the scene but doesn't take too much away from the feel, its also very powerful because the relastionship between creasy bear and pita is heartwarming and the ending is also very sad, its got some very funny humor early on to show how they grow on eachother, but soon things get serious.  Don't expect some big huge action sequence, there are some creative killings and some explosions but thats about all the action.  Mostly its a charater drama, a well done one, and for that i think it deserves some oscar noms, i give it a 9 out of a 10, the spaztic camera use and some of the music could have been worked on, but other then that its a brilliant movie.  If you want some good quotes for when your pissed watch this movie, and Kill Bill which is alittle better(more entertaining overall), but there both incredible movies.</p></body></html>

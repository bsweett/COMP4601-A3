<meta name="summary" content="Tour de Force for Peter O'Toole as T.E. Lawrence"></head><body><p>This is movie is an excellent WWI desert war film. I was captivated immediately by Peter O'Toole as T.E. Lawrence. What a strange character but he gets the job done. He gets the job done but whose job is it in reality? Jos&eacute; Ferrer as the Bey is perfect as the homosexual Turkish commander who leaves an indelible mark on Lawrence. The desert is eternal. This film is complex and perplexing in nature. This is probably David Lean's greatest directorial effort.</p></body></html>

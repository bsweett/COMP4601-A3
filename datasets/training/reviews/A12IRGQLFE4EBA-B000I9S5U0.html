They are both fabulous actors anyway but this movie comes together nicely!  They compliment each other well as husband and wife ...<br /><br />This movie is really just too perfect for words.  The dialog is solid, the acting is solid, the setting is solid ... even the costumes and backdrop looks like America circa 1930's in New York!  Ron Howard has again outdone himself.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  I haven't walked away feeling great from a good, well written solid movie in a long time!  Cinderella Man is the perfect cherry on top of the sundae. ;)</p></body></html>

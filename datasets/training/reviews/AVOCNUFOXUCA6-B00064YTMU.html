<meta name="summary" content="Tedious, boring and stupid"></head><body><p>This movie is "Kitten With a Whip" meets "Terminator" and "Miami Vice" - but without any of the excitement, fun, plot or interest you would expect from jamming those things together.<br /><br />Tom Cruise's performance is at the center of this movie, and even though he may be a bizarre couch-bouncing Brooke Shields-berating spazz, he's still a great actor.  He and Jamie Foxx are the only two things saving this moving from direct-to-video land.<br /><br />The pacing of this movie is atrocious.  The Exposition is clunky and ponderous, and even then barely gets out amidst all of the extraneous junk in the first 15 minutes of this movie.  By the way, after the first 15 minutes,  you know exactly what is going to happen in this predictable dog.  Rather than being suspenseful or even languid, the film dithered.  Hey, it's not every movie that takes you on a detour to a jazz club.  And this movie is polite enough to stop to let coyotes cross the street.  However, even chopping out 30 minutes of tedium wouldn't help this movie, due to the plethora of other flaws.<br /><br />We see many of the most annoying movie cliches here.  Man Wrongly Accused - my wife's favorite.  Educated Successful Professional Woman Isn't Fulfilled Until Meeting Working Class Man with Heart of Gold - check.  Colombians Dealing Drugs - got that.  Captive Blows Obvious Chances to Escape - check.  Woman Needs Man to Rescue Her - yep.  We even have the Incredible Unkillable Villain, and to top it off, the Hero's Death Battle Exemption.  You can play this at home.  Blend all these together into a script over the course of a tipsy evening and you can do better than "Collateral" did.  The problem here is not just that the cliches are tedious in and of themselves; rather, they form the entire plot, such as it is.<br /><br />Before "Collateral," the movie "Point Break" was the poster child for cheesy pure-coincidence police "work," because one lucky break led Keanu right to the bank robbers with no need for that pesky logical analysis stuff.  But "Collateral" really takes the cake, with 4-count-em-4 unlikely-beyond-your-wildest-dreams coincidences assisting the cops in their attempt to figure out what's going on.  Because that's what makes a good crime movie - stupid cops and random coincidence.<br /><br />Michael Mann's contempt for Los Angeles drips from every frame, from the dialogue to the choice of shots and locations.  I happen to love LA (just like Randy Newman), and that was one more reason I didn't care for this movie.<br /><br />And one last thing - what the heck does the word "collateral" have to do with this movie?<br /><br />Avoid, avoid, avoid.  If you insist on seeing a Michael Mann film, rent or buy "Manhunter" instead, from a time before the director started making flabby, self-indulgent films like this.</p></body></html>

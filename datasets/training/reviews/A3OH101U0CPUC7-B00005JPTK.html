<meta name="summary" content="Struggle for survival"></head><body><p>Director Francis Lawrence is the third to adapt Richard Matheson's classic novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765357151">I Am Legend</a> to the big screen.  The story takes place three years after a cure for cancer mutated into a virus that transformed humanity into cannibalistic ghouls who can't bear sunlight.  In the midst of this is Robert Neville (Will Smith) who appears to be the last surviving human.  Neville was an army scientist, and has been searching for a cure ever since the outbreak began.  He has turned his home into a fortress to keep him safe at night and spends his days foraging for food and other essentials in addition to conducting research.  Neville is fighting the good fight, but with only his loyal German shepherd to keep him company, he's struggling to maintain his sanity.<br /><br />For those who have read the book, there are numerous changes in the story.  These changes are significant enough that one is better served simply watching the movie for its own sake and setting aside the book completely.  Think of it as "inspired by" rather than "based on" the novel.  While there is some humor, the overall tone of the movie is pretty bleak.  Neville lives under the constant threat of sudden death if he wanders into the wrong place or allows the creatures to find his home.  The infected are ferociously aggressive, fast, agile, relentless, and cunning.<br /><br />Will Smith turns in a strong performance, which will surprise no one who has seen him before.  His dog is very likeable as well, and the audience roots for him just as much as Neville (maybe more if you're an animal lover).  The pace of the movie is uneven and it sags a bit in the middle.  The action scenes are all quite scary, though, as the infected are so hyperactively vicious in the way they attack.  The ending doesn't quite fit the rest of the movie, but it should satisfy those who want to see something hopeful come out of all the tragedy that has taken place.<br /><br />I did have some problems with certain aspects of the movie.  At one point, the infected apparently set a trap for Neville that is simple in some ways, but very complex in others.  I'm not at all certain that I could rig the same trap, and these creatures are portrayed as being so primitive and rabid that it's hard to picture them hatching such a plan.  I had other issues with the plot, but since they occur in the second half, I will not specify them to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />I Am Legend is a decent movie and the legion of Will Smith fans will almost certainly want to give it a try.  It's far from perfect, but it has scary action scenes, pathos, and even a little humor.  As mentioned earlier, fans of the book will need to set aside their expectations and go along for the ride or avoid this movie like the plague.  You will not find anything remotely resembling a faithful re-creation here.</p></body></html>

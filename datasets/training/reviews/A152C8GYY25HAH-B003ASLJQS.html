<meta name="summary" content="A stunning psychological thriller -Eastwood's best"></head><body><p>"Mystic River" is a rich, densely-layered movie. Part drama, part psychological thriller, it is one of the finest films of 2003. It is also an actor's dream. Containing at least a half dozen excellent roles, it provided Sean Penn a Best Actor Oscar, as well as one for Tim Robbins as Best Supporting Actor.  <p>`Riveting' is a good word to describe the story. At the start, three boyhood friends are playing games on the sidewalks of a working-class Boston neighborhood. Two men, allegedly cops, abduct one of the boys. He is found a few days later in a cellar. He has been sexually molested and, naturally, is traumatized. The movie implies that no one knows how to deal with what has happened to the boy. It's a working-class, Catholic neighborhood. Life just goes on.<p>Flash forward about thirty years later to the present. Each boy's life has taken a different path. Jimmy [Sean Penn] has become the operator of a successful neighborhood grocery store - but only after a stretch in prison for armed robbery. He still hangs out with the local thugs. Sean [Kevin Bacon] has become a detective with the Boston police department. His professional life is fine but his personal life is a shambles. Dave [Tim Robbins], the one who was kidnapped, lives life as best he can. When Jimmy's teenage daughter is brutally murdered, the three boyhood friends reunite on a chaotic collision course which leads to tragedy. <p>This is not a movie for people with short attention spans. Those who do not pay attention may be befuddled by the end of it. <p>"Mystic River" is possibly Clint Eastwood's crowning achievement in a long and very interesting career. It's the kind of movie that would be hard for any filmmaker to top.</p></body></html>

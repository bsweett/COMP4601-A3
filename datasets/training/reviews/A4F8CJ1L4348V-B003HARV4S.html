<meta name="summary" content="A well thought out film and plot"></head><body><p>This is the type of movie that keeps you guessing and keeps you in "wonder" throughout the movie. The writer took some time to think about what should be told and when. I do love period pieces and really loved this one. It is a thriller, drama, romance and mystifying movie all rolled into one. The acting was excellent especially Edward Norton's role. He was well cast in this role and fit into to a tee. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes period pieces with a little mystery mixed in.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="If 28 Days Later had a feeble little brother, this would be it."></head><body><p>New directors equal different material, and often times, worse material. We see that when it comes to 28 Weeks Later, the sequel to the stylishly original 28 Days Later. It's a solid effot and packed with entertainment, but falls short in terms of the longevity category. When I think longevity, I think of films that stand alone. This is not one of those films.<br /><br />The concept is nice. As viewers, we visit London 28 weeks after the outbreak and roughly two months after the last incident of infection. The US military is in the process of bringing civilization back to London, as they've sealed off a protected area in the heart of London that has everything from running water to electricity. On nearly every rooftop there is a sniper, prepared for the worse. It seems that the powers that be have thought of everything and are ready for any situation. That's until, of course, SHE shows up.<br /><br />"She" is a mother played by the always-gorgeous Catherine McCormack. She is seemingly infected, but at the same time immune. In other words, she doesn't show signs of the disease - like rage - but if, say, someone like her husband were to kiss her, he would become infected and all hell might break lose. And guess what happens?<br /><br />It's 10 minutes into such a catastrophic levy being openened that I found myself being extremely entertained. I cannot, however, say that the last half-hour of the film was satisfying. As a viewer, I wanted the film to go in certain directions and found that in almost each case (except for a brilliantly executed final 5 minutes of the film), the director had other ideas.<br /><br />This is not your father's 28 Days Later. This is something else. It's not altogether bad, but when stacked against older brother, 28 Weeks Later looks rather weak and in need of some practice.</p></body></html>

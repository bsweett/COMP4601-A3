Stuff Blows Up Real Good!! including the plot.."></head><body><p>This movie is just like a Terminator: It crashes around, makes alot of loud noise but is actually brain-dead. This film was supposed to be a "Blockbuster" but I did'nt get that impression when I was watching it. The Arnold is the only actor from the original film who plays the same character that he did in the firat 2 films. <p>  Terminator 3's big "draw"? A female terminator! (Whoopee..) She blows up stuff real good, can inflate her cha-cha's and can make cars drive themselves by taking over their cruise control systems. This movie's writers should have tried activatating their car's cruise control and letting go of the wheel: Presto -no more bad scripts. <p>  As I was watching this tribute to destruction, I kept asking myself "Would'nt the terminators cause a Moebius Strip?", an endless loop in time: Kid grows up into Terminator controlled world-->sends Terminator to past-->Terminator saves kid in past-->kid grows up into......<p>  Bottom line: the movie is OK if you do not think too much while watching it.</p></body></html>

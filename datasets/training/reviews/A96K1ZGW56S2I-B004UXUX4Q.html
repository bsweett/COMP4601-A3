She was involved in a boating accident. Also, Matt, one of several descendants of a Hawaiian princess, is the sole trustee of a family trust that controls over 25,000 acres of untouched land on the island of Kaua'i. Matt must decide for his family what is to be done with the land. At the same time, he's given the news that his wife will never recover and she has a living will, so all the machines will soon be unplugged and she will slowly die. So, Matt has to contact his in-laws and all of his wife's friends and notify them of his wife's impending death so that they can say farewell. In addition, Matt is getting used to raising his daughters, 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley) by himself. In the midst of all of this, Matt learns that his wife was having an affair for the past two years and decides to find Elizabeth's lover and inform him that she's dying so he can say farewell. Thus begins a mini-journey with his children (and a tag-a-long friend of his daughter, Alex) that brings his family closer together.<br /><br />The film has some really beautiful scenic shots, but when you're filming in Hawaii, that's not too difficult. The movie also features the finest performance of George Clooney's career. Even though Clooney has starred in lots of tv and film, he's best known for his good looks and comic ability (see O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU) and hasn't had many opportunities to display his range as an actor. THE DESCENDANTS gives him plenty of opportunities. It's his best role to date.<br /><br />THE DESCENDANTS also features the breakout performance of Shailene Woodley. Woodley is a young actress who hasn't had much exposure but THE DESCENDANTS will be her springboard to stardom. She displays the depth of emotion of a person who has lived several lifetimes.<br /><br />Beyond the fine acting, THE DESCENDANTS really doesn't offer much. Directed and co-written by Alexander Payne, the film has been nominated for and won all kinds of awards and has been listed on numerous critic's "Best Of 2011" lists. I think the main reason for this is because this is an Alexander Payne movie. Make no mistake, Payne is a talented director. I loved ELECTION and SIDEWAYS and even though I find ABOUT SCHMIDT incredibly depressing, it's also fascinating. However, THE DESCENDANTS lacks the life and personality that make those movies so interesting. There are a few really funny scenes in the movie (I don't know why, but watching Clooney run is hilarious), but there's nothing outstanding hilarious. Close to a third of the movie is told in voice-over from King. I don't have an issue with voice-over, but you can't overuse it and it has to be done correctly. THE DESCENDANTS abuses the voice-over. Also, the movie has way too many close-up shots. I realize that it's done for affect, but like the voice-over abuse, the close-up is used way too much in the movie. However, even putting these technical abuses aside, THE DESCENDANTS isn't good movie because it's really not that interesting of a story. The audience is glad to see how things turn out in the end, but it's almost an afterthought. I was looking forward to seeing THE DESCENDANTS, but much like the way I felt after seeing THE SOCIAL NETWORK in 2010 my reaction at the end of the movie was, "That's it?"<br /><br />There's some great acting in THE DESCENDANTS, but overall the movie is a tale, "full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."</p></body></html>

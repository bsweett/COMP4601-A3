<meta name="summary" content="A movie in a higher level"></head><body><p>"The motorcycle diaries" is Walter Salles' (from "Central station" and "Behind the sun") latest movie. This time the brazilian director manages a multi-country latin american crew and actors, in a film that tells the story of Ernesto "Che" Guevara de la Serna, in his first and, maybe, most important revolution: the one that took place inside himself. <p>"The motorcycle diaries", based on the homonimous book by Guevara, is a first person account of the trip two argentinian friends took early in their lives, throughout the South American continent, beginning in Buenos Aires and ending in Venezuela. One of those friends was the young Guevara (not yet "Che"), one year before completing his medicine college. The other one is Alberto Granado, pharmaceutic, a little older, a funny, easy-going bon-vivant. We can describe them as a restless pair, but even they don't know what their restless is about. All they know is that this trip will be utterly important in their lives, and they couldn't be more correct. In Chile, they get to know the terrible conditions of the copper miners; in Peru, they work in a leprosary. All this among many other adventurous, funny and memorable moments. <p>To me, the most interesting fact in the movie is that it shows the early life of Che Guevara. I was expecting a movie about political ideologies and revolutions, and got a subtle, beautiful, emotional movie, feelings that no politics could ever arise in myself. Mexican Gael Garcia Bernal and argentinian Rodrigo de la Serna are almost perfect in their roles. It feels they have known each other for years. It's impossible for the viewer to stand indifferent to what they do on screen. <p>There are two other things that come to mind as good features in "The motorcycle diaries". First, the fantastic cinematography. From the rural argentininan landscape, through the desertic mining fields of Chile, through Macchu-Pichu, to the Peruvian Amazon, this is certainly one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. And by that I don't mean endless and meaningless landscape or sunset shots. Every frame on the movie has the purpose to bring the viewers closer to the characters, making us climb abord with them on their motorcycle, or in a boat, or even on foot through the cold desert's night. The second thing is Walters Salles' direction. As this is a movie based on real events, Salles' experience with documentaries comes really at hand. It's impossible not to imagine this movie as real, authentic, in a powerful way. <p>This is a movie that must be watched, since words will not come close to what it really is. <p>Grade 9.4/10</p></body></html>

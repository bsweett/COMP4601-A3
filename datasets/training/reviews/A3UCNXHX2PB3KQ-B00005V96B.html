John Goodman and Billy Crystal are wonderful and hysterical in the parts of Mike and Sully. Its a fun movie, seemingly set in another world. Monster City is, of course full of scary looking monsters. The entire city is powered by children screaming! But, ironically, the monsters are even more afraid of the children then they are of them. And when one of those children, the delightful Boo, breaks lose into their world, problems of course ensure. The ending is sweet, and the whole movie is very enjoyable and loaded with great scenes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nolan delivers.  A solid film that won't overwhelm, but deserves a second viewing"></head><body><p>The Prestige is a movie in which my review cannot do justice.  The movie advertises itself as one with twist after twist and one at the end you will not believe.  Christopher Nolan directed this movie, Batman Begins and also Memento, one of the best "twist" movies ever.<br /><br />The Prestige has a great cast:  Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johnassen and Michael Caine.  All do exceptional work in this movie set in the early 1900s.  Jackman and Bale are both magicians and bitter rivals.  The two spend the movie trying to find the secrets to the other's tricks, deceiving each other professionally and personally.<br /><br />This movie is enjoyable because of its great cast, beautiful scenery, and exciting riveting plot.  On the downside, there are no good guys.  Moments after the film, I found myself questioning why I rooted for the character I did.  Was the good guy really good?  Was the bad guy really bad?  While this movie gives you a lot to ponder, I didn't feel a huge stake in the outcome and thus wasn't blown away by the conclusion.  This is still a movie you must see and one of the better movies out right now.<br /><br />I suggest you stop reading reviews now and try not to read anything about this movie to prevent you learning its secrets.  I believe that after you see the movie once, you'll want to see it again.  There are so many scenes that can be viewed differently once you know the truth.</p></body></html>

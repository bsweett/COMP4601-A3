<meta name="summary" content="The most horrifying and shocking monster flick ever"></head><body><p>Even though I was not a kid when I first saw this, it planted kernals of fear and revulsion in my imagination that has lasted until today.  A group of men - some scientists, some army grunts - are isolated in Antarctica, when their routine is disturbed by the sudden appearance of a helicopter that appears to be hunting a dog.  Though it explodes, this doesn't slow down one of the mysterious occupants, who are Norwegian, from shooting at the dog regardless of the danger it poses to the Americans standing aghast at the spectacle.  It is inexplicable, horrifically violent, and violates all the assumptions that men would normally make.  Several terrible mistakes are made:  the surviving Norwegian is shot by a security man without any explanation elicited, the dog is allowed the run of the compound, and the communications man fails to contact the outside authorities.  This casts the die for all that follows.<br /><br />OK, I am going to assume that anyone reading this knows the plot, so am not going to try to avoid the ***spoilers***.  The dog, it turns out, is an alien that the Norwegians discovered.  Its true nature is revealed when it is at last put in the kennel, where it transforms itself into a mass of greasy, flailing tubes and ripped flesh that spews liquid while seeking to ingest the other dogs.  The men quickly realize they are facing something unprecedented, a being that is like an infection that can consume any living creature and mimic it almost perfectly.  While it is vulnerable during transformation, this makes it a most formidable enemy.  Not only do the men not know who has become one of the creatures, but they suspect eachother to such an extent that all order and trust begin to break down.  The ensuing mayhem is unlike anything I have ever seen in cinema.  You wait for the characters - none of them particularly  likable or even interesting - to get picked off or murdered one by one.<br /><br />An additional danger is limned by a scientist who later appears to go insane.  He calculates that, should the creature reach a civilized area, the entire world will be infected in 27,000 hours.  But the purpose or goal of the creature, which first landed on earth at least 100,000 years ago and was frozen in suspended animation, remain opaque and hence food for the imagination of lovers of hard scifi.  This, I think, is the most frightening part of the film, indeed it is a completely original extrapolation from Bodysnatchers and other 50s scifi.  It heralds the end of humanity.  At the end, one of the characters admits that, because they have no idea of the limits of the infection, it is perhaps better if they die.  The perfect ending, with everything left hanging in the balance and yet no need for a sequel.<br /><br />The special effects, while primitive as modeled clay and rubber puppets rather than computer-generated images, are nonetheless compelling and utterly disgusting.  During transformation, the creatures appear to secrete a bloody liquid, though their interiors contain grotesque remnants of their past identities, from slimy dog or human heads to presumably alien lifeforms of singular ferocity.  There is a scene where the doctor is treating a heart attack victim, only to find the man's chest peels away to reveal giant jaws that bite off his hands; once incinerated by flamethrower, the creature's head seeks to survive on its own, pulling itself to safety by a prehensile tongue and then growing spider-like legs studded with eyes.  In another scene, a human-appearing creature captures a man, covering his mouth with a hand while tendrils corrupt his body with infection, which his eyes reveal he is helpless to stop.  These images are unforgettable.<br /><br />The acting is particularly strong, with Kurt Russel in his prime.  I completely believed what was happening, from their confusion to their paranoid frenzies.  That makes this a first-rate hard scifi thriller, full of action and unanswered questions.  Beyond the horror, the film filled me with wonder at the possibilities of the universe.  It is by far the best Carpenter film I have ever seen.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm for those who can stomach the horror.</p></body></html>

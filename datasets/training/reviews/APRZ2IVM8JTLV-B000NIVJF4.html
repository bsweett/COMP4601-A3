At first enthusiastic---and taking the opportunity to get some Black female tail---the Scotman eventually realizes that Africa is no place for whitey and wants to go home. Amin hangs him from a pair of meathooks instead.<br /><br />  A vanity piece designed to get Whittaker an Oscar for playing Amin, the film is one of those White man goes to someplace third world and learns a lesson movies---usually that white people should not go or get involved with non-white countries. These can work as a ploy to use the character as a device to tell the history of that country---but this only works if the film places the character where he can see things---so the audience can see them and that the character is both likable and has a moral center. The film flounders in that the Scotsman is usually never where he should be and consequently the viewer never learns just what is going on. Unless one is cognizant of Ugandan history, the viewer cannot expect to come away from the film with anything but the most basic idea that Amin overthrew a Communist govt(NO!!!), killed many people and was possibly insane. The Entebbe ending will be inexplicable to anyone who does not know the Entebbe story. Way too much time is expended on the Scotsman having sex with Blacks and not enough with Amin. While Whittaker is very good APPEARING as Amin, he never actually PLAYS Amin. His scenes feel like a series of cameos where a main character will encounter a historical personage for a scene or two and then move on. Amin never develops as a person. We know he has personality and went bad but we never learn why. He just is always as the Scotsman finds him. The film ends during the middle of the Entebbe affair so we never even get to the end of Amins dictatorship. The film just stops. The second flaw is that the Scotsman is a potty mouthed over sexed dim bulb twit who, as, at least, two character observe rightly, really has no reason to live. So the film has no moral center at all. There is nothing there to engage or hold the viewers interest. Whittaker would have been better served by doing a straight forward biography of Amin and dumping the fictional Scotman.<br /><br />  Anderson--with a great British accent and looking like sex served up on a plate--gives a solid performance------in a nothing part that could easily should/could have been cut. She seems only to be there for the scene where she walks away from the Scotsman--and the viewer--so we can get a look at that fine jiggly thing she has down there.<br /><br />  But is that something we should be concerned with in a film about a homocidal maniac who murdered over 300,000 of his countryman and was allied with MUslem barbarians??<br /><br />  Not a bad film. Worth seeing but mostly forgettable. The definative Amin film still waits to be made.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="interesting film"></head><body><p>A Clockwork Orange is the kind of film that, upon reviewed, many of these reviews often get criticized for either missing the point, or not entirely understanding what the movie writers were going for during its creation.<br /><br />I'm just another person with an opinion, but the way *I* interpreted the storyline is like this-<br /><br />A punk teenager from England is the leader of a gang, and he does some of the worst things imaginable.  He and his gang torture people while dancing around the room and singing, they rape women and feel no remorse whatsoever, and this gang of punks basically just continues to ruin peoples lives as they find new victims during their deplorable nightly journeys around the town.<br /><br />Some people view this film as a dark comedy, but I honestly fail to see any comedy elements whatsoever.  I don't think this is an example of another American who doesn't understand British humor either.  I just don't see how anything taking place is supposed to be funny.<br /><br />Oh sure, some of the sexual references have a bit of humor to them (such as the one gang member picking up a statue of a... mans thingy) but the thing is, if you look at the plot from an overall point of view, the main focus of the storyline is obviously NOT funny at all.  It's about an extremely serious matter and delivered in a twisted way.<br /><br />Let me put it another way- just because you witness a few scenes that could probably pass for comedy, it's really easy to dismiss these particular scenes since the main focus should definitely be on the shocking seriousness of the storyline.  Actually, considering the year this film was released, it wouldn't surprise me if those slightly humurous bits were included simply as a way to cover-up how disturbing this movie *really* could have been, had the writers been granted permission to go out and make it even more shocking.<br /><br />With that said, a Clockwork Orange is highly enjoyable because, for one thing, the first 20 minutes of film are VERY shocking considering the time period in which this film was created- the early 70's.  Not many films back then touched upon topics in *this* much brutal detail.<br /><br />I liked when the one gang member asked to be involved in a new experiment to figure out what triggers murderers and psychotics to go absolutely insane.  Without spoiling anything, the guy had to go through mental pain the likes of which most people wouldn't be able to handle, and well, by the time he was released, that mental pain quickly turned to physical.  You'll see what I mean by this.  Talk about VERY clever writing.  What goes around comes around is the moral of this storyline.<br /><br />Overall, the storyline holds up remarkably well, the acting is really good (though entirely British- be prepared for that) and it's easy to see the kind of reputation a Clockwork Orange has built over the years.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Maria is full of Catalina."></head><body><p>Maria Full of Grace is a surprisingly compelling foreign film this year or recent years. It's a very good low-budget film made by an American writer and director(Joshua Marston) which had taken him 5 years from writing the script to the finished film. The debut performance from the mesmerizing Catalina Sandino Moreno is trully captivating. She came across as a combination of Salma Hayek and LeeLee Sobieski. This film had won her the Berlin's best actress award, and I was really touched by her character as well as her performance.<br /><br />Maria(Catalina) is an 18 year old living in poverty, and she works in a rose plantation in Columbia in order to bring home the bacon. She quit her job after an arguement with her boss, and her family was angry at her for losing the job. Meanwhile, she found out that she's pregnant and she has no desire to marry her "stupid" boyfriend. While she was looking for a new job, a friend of hers from the neighborhood introduced her to a drug dealer and told her that she can make lots of money working for him.<br /><br />The job is to carry as many as 100 pellets of drugs in her stomach to New York city. It's a risky business, because if she gets caught, they might send her to jail. Also, if the pellets break in her stomach, she will die. Considered the big chunk of cash she wanted to earn, she took the job.<br /><br />Along with several other girls on the flight who are also "carriers", Maria was very anxious whether she could make it all the way. She had to go to the toilet to "eliminate", and when some of the pellets came out, she had to wash them and swallow them down again. Her friend Lucy was in sweats, and had no idea that the pellet in her had been broken.<br /><br />Maria was taken to the customs when she landed, because they suspected her and took an x-ray on her, and found out she was pregnant. She swore that she was not a "carrier", and they released her. One of the girls got caught, Maria, Lucy, and Blanca survived the customs.<br /><br />They were picked up by the local dealers outside the airport and taken to a motel to "eliminate" the pellets. Lucy was already dying, and ultimately the dealers ended up cutting her open in order to get the pellets. Maria and Blanca were horrified and ran away with the pellets. They had no where to turn except Jucy's sister who had lived in NY for 4 years. There they had to figure out how to solve their trouble and tell the truth to Lucy's sister....<br /><br />This is my favorite Spanish film since Talk To Her, and I think it's going to get a few Oscar nominations including best original screenplay and possibly best actress, considered that they had nominated the girl from Whale Rider.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sky Captain meets Matrix meets Equilibrium"></head><body><p>Nighly stylized movie that uses Sky Captain CPG with an Equilibrium theme.<br /><br />In the future, a blood disease creats a world of normals and hemophobes. I'm good with that part, and Mila Jovinovitch rocks as the comic book hero `Ultraviolet'. What doesn't rock is her ability to create weapons out of thin air. There is no explaination how, and the dumbass drones after her don't have the same ability. Personally, I wonder how a lowly rebel could have more at her disposal than a government funded ARMY of top notch killers!<br /><br />The whole film is shot in CG touches a la Sky Captain and The World Of Tommorrow. This supposed to be about her being a rebel and rescuing a human child with a protein in his blood that can cure the world's `vampire' problem. In reality, it is simply an outlandish style of cinematography.<br /><br />Normally, I would have given this a 1 star. Poor piece of film. Period. BUT, after the Resident Evil series, I felt MJ did a very nice job here. Thus the 2 stars.<br /><br />Do not buy, but wsit until it is on cable, which I did. Even then, I got it on Starz, and used DVR time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="They suffered pain.  And I suffered boredom."></head><body><p>There's a star-studded cast in this film, directed by Sam Mendes of "American Beauty" fame.  And there's some excellent cinematography.  It's about gangsters in the 1930s, with emphasis on father-son relationships.  I was prepared to enjoy it. I didn't.<p>The story takes place in 1931, and Tom Hanks is cast as a mob enforcer who works for the boss, played by Paul Newman.  When Hanks' 12-year old son, Tyler Hoechlin, is witness to what his father does, the plot is set in motion.  There are tragedies galore as each character meets an awful fate, some at the hands of Jude Law, cast as a killer who photographs his victims.  With high drama like that, I should have been sitting on the edge of my seat instead of yawning and looking at my watch.<p>The cast tried, they really did.  All the acting is wonderful.  But the screenplay moved too slowly.  And the director had most of the scenes take place in the rain or snow or bitter cold.  It was all heavy stuff, without a bit of lightness.  I never did identify with any of them, as they just were a little too soaked in tragedy to be real.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What a hero....."></head><body><p>Just proves you can overcome your birth.  Hellboy was born out of a hole in a transcendental portal that was a joint project of Rasputin and the Nazis in a last-ditch attempt to create the New World Order.<br /><br />He was raised by Prof. Bloom and works for the Bureau of Psychic Phenomenon, a group set together to battle evil.  He's red as an apple,  smokes stogies, files his horns to fit in, and likes cats.<br /><br />The graphics, the concept is faithful to the comics.  I think the action could have been upped a bit.  There are quite a few slower portions in the films unlike Xmen, or Blade, for example.<br /><br />Overall, a good and interesting film and an essential for Hellboy comic fans who want a 'complete set.'</p></body></html>

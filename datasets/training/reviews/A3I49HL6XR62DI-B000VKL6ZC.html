That honor goes to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXWHSA">The Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>, Zombie's visceral, shocking and funny tribute to B-movie gorefests. Halloween is an extremely weak re-make of John Carpenter's masterpiece, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009UW0N">Halloween (Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition)</a>. The most innovative and creative part of Zombie's film is the first hour where he explores the birth of a serial killer. Zombie's extraordinary depiction of Michael's life in a hellish home where domestic violence is the norm and sexually explicit language abounds is so well done. The young actor who portrays Michael is perfect. Sherri Moon Zombie plays Michael's mother quite well and even throws in a pole dance for good measure. Michael's life in a mental institution is also extremely well done, culminating in a bloody murder spree as he escapes. One wishes Zombie had stopped there and called the film: "Halloween: The Beginning". Unfortunately,the last 45 minutes of the film consists of an extremely weak and hurried remake of Carpenter's original film. Laurie Stode, Michael's sister, is so annoying that you will want to kill her yourself. She wines and screams all the time and it's merciful when Michael kills her equally annoying friends. The last 20 mintues of this bloody mess are pure agony -- a confusing mishmash of mayhem as Michael knocks holes in an attic, trying to pry Laurie out. So dumb. I must, however, compliment Malcom McDowell on his performance as Dr. Loomis. He brings dignity to a role that was owned by Donald Pleasance. An odd and annoying thing about this film is the confusion about the time in which it is set. The musical soundtrack is late 70's, but people are using cell phones. Guys have long hair, but girls are wearing clothes that appear to be at least 90's stuff. Just makes your head want to explode. Runtime is about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Way too long and absolutely exhausting. Trust me, the original and most of its sequels are better ways to spend your time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="No Way to this BLU -RAY.....2 star disc 5 star movie!"></head><body><p>Don't bother with this Blu-ray...<br />I just watched the 2 disc collectors edition a couple days back and loved it so when I spotted this in the store today I snapped it up.  Trouble is....without a serious A/B  test....it didn't really look ANY better than the standard disc and is twice the price. Frankly ...I wish I had NOT purchased this on BLU-RAY and its one  of my favorite movies. Much of this will no doubt be due to the available light photography for the film which doesn't upgrade well..but be warned.</p></body></html>

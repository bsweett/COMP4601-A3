<meta name="summary" content="There Will Be Blood... and OIL!"></head><body><p>Paul Thomas Anderson's film adaptation of Upton Sinclair's novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143112260">Oil!</a> is a somber masterpiece. There Will Be Blood is a fascinating examination of mankind's descent into madness, greed and zealotry. But rather than being heavy-handed or pretentious, the film is subtle, ironic and darkly humorous. It's not often that you see an American film that so skillfully balances these themes without being tainted by political partiality. Nor has there been a film in recent years that so rightly caused controversy. And yet I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be affected by it... or to forget it.<br /><br />As viewers, we are first introduced to Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) while he's working as a miner in 1898. Soon after his interests turn to oil. From the onset we can see that he is a single-minded, determined man of an unusual nature. His main concern in life isn't himself, or his workers, or even his own son. His only care is his business and even that he pursues with seeming indifference. Daniel is not an emotive individual. He's coldly ambitious and the only evidence of his feeling human emotion at all is his explosive anger. But Daniel hides his temperament from the people he scams. He uses his son as a mascot, promoting a fabricated image of a family run business. He unrelentingly pursues landowners with a confidence that borders on egomaniacal. Still, he isn't a monster... yet. When a young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) claims that his family farm has oil that seeps through the ground, Daniel is at first skeptical of a man who appears so earnest. Paul intends to be paid for his information and he doesn't care if his family loses money to Plainview. This suits Daniel well (opportunism and industry went hand in hand in the early 20th century). Daniel and his son, H.W. arrive in Paul's small town where they meet the Sunday family. Their son Eli, Paul's identical twin brother, is a preacher of a fanatical Evangelist cult and he's reluctant to allow his family to sell their land to Daniel. He can see that Daniel is a successful man and that he may be able to profit from Daniel's keen sense of business. The pairing of these two men, both dangerously greedy and prideful, leads to a dramatic confrontation. Eli says that God will curse the oil well unless Daniel pays tribute to the church and allows Eli to bless the derrick. When Daniel dismisses Eli disaster strikes and H.W. suffers the consequences. Before long a stranger shows up in town declaring that he's Daniel's long lost brother. But he is not what he seems and Daniel's discovery of this brings him to the precipice of insanity and pushes him over the edge. His combined guilt for his mistakes with H.W., his all-consuming hatred of Eli and his blind ambition lead him to a horrific finale. The last scene of the film is an electrifying and unsettling culmination of one man's journey into madness.<br /><br />This film isn't for everyone. I loved it but I enjoy stories told from the dark depths of the human psyche. The film isn't as violent as the title implies but it is shocking and disturbing. Paul Thomas Anderson has created a psychological epic chronicling two men's moral and mental disintegration. The style of the film reminds me of controversial director, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007CVSB">D.W. Griffith's silent historical melodramas</a> which explore similarly pessimistic views of life. Ultimately There Will Be Blood is a masterful exploration of two greatly flawed characters who are portrayed by immensely talented actors.</p></body></html>

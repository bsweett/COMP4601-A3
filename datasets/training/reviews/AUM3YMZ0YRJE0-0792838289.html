I was happily surprized at its subtlty.  You get the plot of brainwashing, but then the film explores how it works and how it fits with the psychology of each affected character.<br /><br />Except for his obligatory fight scene, Sinatra is excellent as the ravaged man of duty struggling to fight what has happended to his mind.  While he pales in comparison to Laurence Harvey's psychological journey, this is one of his best acting performances.  The bad guys pulling the strings are also extremely good, and of course one wonders if all of them were exposed...<br /><br />This is such a masterpiece that the only reason I can see to re-make it is that Hollywood has run out of ideas in its never-ending search to make money.  Get this.  You won't be disappointed and it is all you need for a totally satisfying entertainment experience that is also very fun to think about.</p></body></html>

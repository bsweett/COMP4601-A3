I don't want anyone dying for me. ~Briseis<br /><br />If you have yet to view the greatest war story of all time, I would highly recommend listening to Robert Fagles translation on audio cassette. While it takes 9 hours to listen to the story, your viewing experience of this movie will be greatly enhanced. The original story seems to imply that the cause of the war is more of a game between the gods on Olympus. The participation of the gods is hinted at throughout the movie and in the "Gallery of God" extra feature, but never truly explored. Did Aphrodite offer Paris the love of Helen? Who was actually plotting the destruction of Troy? Is the war simply a game between the gods?<br /><br />With this in mind, it is no wonder that the love between Paris and Helen pales in comparison to all the other themes of love in this movie. It is sweet and romantic, but we never learn enough about either character to become emotionally attached. The love story between Briseis and Achilles seems much more compelling, as is the love between Hector and his wife.<br /><br />There are three main love stories between the main male characters and their chosen women. Then, there is the love of a brother, the love of power, the love of peace, the love of a king for his son and the love men have for their country. This movie is filled with love as the underlying force motivating the actions of men. Most of the women endure great emotional suffering and Helen is presented as a woman who wants to make the right choice, but can't seem to break free from Paris.<br /><br />When I listened to the Iliad on tape, I considered how violent this would be when it was made into a movie. The brutality in the story tends to explode in a similar way to how the fight scenes appear onscreen. The savage energy becomes very primal and yet the brutality is somehow soothed by the use of special effects. At times the movie relapses into a wrestle mania mode for comic relief, but overall this is a very serious movie complete with realistic action and impressive fireballs hurtling across sand dunes. I loved the excitement of the impending doom produced by horses galloping on the sand and the contrast of the war against the peaceful azure sky and sea.<br /><br />Throughout the movie we are presented with two perspectives and frankly we grow to love characters on both sides of this war. As Achilles calls for his men to fight for immortality, Hector appeals to his men to fight for Troy, "mother to us all."<br /><br />The brutal war scenes with magnificent swords and armor seem to take up most of the movie, although there are a few moments of romance. While women are viewed as prizes of war, Achilles actually fights for Briseis and seems to have genuine affection for her. Brad Pitt's fight scenes are quite enjoyable to watch from a "superhero" perspective. The way he fights is unique and therefore quite fascinating. After watching many of his movies, I can't think of anyone more perfect to play Achilles. He has the ability to alternate between extreme violence and tenderness. In this man, a lover resides. It does seem that at times he would rather be a lover than a fighter because he wants to return home. His confrontation with King Priam was well worth waiting for and is quite profound when you truly consider the moment of understanding between enemies.<br /><br />Peter O'Toole (Trojan King Priam) steals the movie with his amazing facial expressions. His look of desperation as he prays in the temple and his look of absolute terror when Hector and Achilles fight is stunning in its emotional impact. These seem to be the pivotal points in the movie and his acting helps to set the mood and add stability to the instability of war.<br /><br />I must say that while I prefer the travels in the Odyssey to a war, it is the heart of the Iliad and the romance in the movie version that fully captured my attention. We are only left wondering about the cost of love and a little worried that maybe the gods were having a bit too much fun while this movie was being made. The special features are very revealing and it is amazing they finished this movie.<br /><br />As someone who doesn't appreciate war movies, I was highly impressed with TROY and watched it twice in 24 hours. The themes reverberate down through the ages and this adaptation makes Homer's Iliad very palatable for today's audience. I had very low expectations and now I wish I had seen this sooner. Even if this is not a perfect version, I enjoy variety in a story and it is more a change in perspective than a complete reordering of the underlying elements. I think they could have made this movie even more enjoyable with less war scenes and a little more intrigue and humor, especially involving the gods. Although it did keep my attention for almost 3 hours, twice.<br /><br />The true irony in this movie is that when Paris finally makes a good judgment call; no one listens to him. Also...what makes "this" Helen worth dying for? I'd love to know more about her character and why Paris fell in love with Helen in the first place. The plot is fairly simple and if you crave complete accuracy and complexity, I'd recommend listening to the audio version or reading a translation.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review</p></body></html>

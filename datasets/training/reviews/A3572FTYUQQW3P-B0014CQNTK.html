Many of these seem forced, out of place, and have a sour note quality.  However, this movie is being touted as the best movie of the year and in my opinion it deserves all of the praise and hype it is getting.  It is so good that it is hard to start describing why it is so good.<br /><br />The screen play and plot are relatively simple and uncomplicated and there are some scenes that could be improved but any weakness in the screenplay is more than offset by some of the scenes and lines that are some of the best I have seen in any movie in a long time.  Near the beginning we see the boys running track and we hear Juno comment that she loves watching their "things flop up and down" and "all she can think of are all of those "pork swords".  We see the boys running throughout the rest of the movie and it is hard to erase this from your mind.  Then we have the fight over the senior prom.  Michael Cera's performance here as the wounded dad and exboyfriend is superb, of course Ellen Page does an outstanding job throughout the entire movie.  Another great scene is with J K Simmons (her dad) when she asks him if true and enduring love is possible.  Speaking from the perspective of a 40 year marriage his response was spot on -- a short but well done scene.<br /><br />Then we have the couple who are slated to adopt the child.  Jason Bateman as the prospective dad does an incredible job of showing his immaturity and self-centeredness.  His reaction when Juno calls him old and rejects him is truly excellent since so much of it is in his expression and body language.  Every single actor in this film did an outstanding job and Ellen Page and Michael Cera were the best I have seen in any movie this year.<br /><br />The camera work was excellent as was the direction.  The scene with the freight train was very symbolic and beautifully done just as the scene where Bateman bolts down the stairs to see Juno.  No words were needed -- great direction.<br /><br />I loved this movie but much of it hit too close to my youth and it left me sort of depressed even though it has a semi-happy ending.  I don't think this is a movie suitable for young children but I think it is wonderful for teens.  This is a great movie and should be a candidate for best movie.  I gave it 5 stars and it deserves every one of them.</p></body></html>

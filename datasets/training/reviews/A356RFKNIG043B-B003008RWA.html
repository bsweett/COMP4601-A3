What makes this film worthwhile are the facts, and the many mirrors he holds up to American prejudices, especially against "socialism", which he reminds us is inherent in libraries, police, roads, and government of almost all stripes, services that we all take for granted as part of "capitalism".<br /><br />Still, Moore can grind on the nerves at times with his cutesy cuts and obvious music choices, and he gets cheesy at various junctures with both editing and close-ups. He's a manipulator, as usual, but then again that's part of making a documentary, so perhaps his main failing is that he can be sloppy at it. He can also be quite good too, though, and let's face it: he got folks watching docs again, and has pissed off the moronic Our-God-or-Die "conservatives" to no end, so he's doing his job as an active American citizen.<br /><br />Above all, most of the points made in Sicko are worth considering. Personally, I work out and eat well and avoid doctors at all costs. If more folks took health into their own hands instead of going to the doctor for a new pill every week, the health care system would work a lot better. But what sane man would ever expect his government to fulfill this most basic human responsibility for him?<br /><br />And let's do what Moore suggests and be totally honest: if Moore himself wasn't such a bloated foodhog he'd be a much more convincing spokesman for health care. How can a man who clearly places no value whatsoever on taking care of his own health tell us all to pay his doctor bills for him? Moore is a bright guy and has made some good films, but his own ill health is a walking billboard for why universal health care will be a big mess in any country where taking care of your own health makes less sense than waiting for the government to do it for you.<br /><br />In fact, I'm willing to bet Moore himself is more than aware of this irony. He's too smart not to be, but clearly not smart enough to exercise the discipline in his own life that he demands here from Washington, D.C. (a place not exactly known for discipline of any sort).<br /><br />Talking the talk means a lot less coming from one who ain't walking the walk.</p></body></html>

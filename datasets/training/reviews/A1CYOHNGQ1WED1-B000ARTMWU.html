<meta name="summary" content="An exciting, nasty, bloody mess"></head><body><p>I love horror movies but most of them suck so I rented High Tension without any expectations and was pleasantly surprised. My taste must run along a different line considering all the negative reviews here.<br /><br />Marie and Alex are college students going to Alex's family farm for some peace and quiet to study. The first evening there, a man shows up, murders the mother, father and child and chains Alex up to take along with him. Marie manages to avoid him and stows away in the back of the man's truck trying to find a way to free Alex. As the movie nears the end there is a big twist, which I'll admit having mixed feelings about. On the one hand it was kind of cool, but if you think about it too much, it doesn't make a lot of sense with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />This movie is bloody as hell with some very graphic scenes. If you like your horror more psychological this one isn't for you, but if you like your violence painted with buckets of blood, High Tension is a good one.</p></body></html>

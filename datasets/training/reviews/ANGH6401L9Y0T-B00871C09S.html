How can I lose?<br /><br />Stewart is an action photographer whose leg was broken in getting a special shot of a car race. He's in a cast, and bored to tears with nothing to do. So he looks out his rear window into all the other windows that face it. We get to follow quite a few sub-plot stories along with him in those rear windows. Because this is Hitchcock, several are pretty amusing.<br /><br />Grace Kelly is in love with Stewart, but she's just "too perfect." She's a buyer for a top dress shop, or perhaps the dress department in a posh department store. Evidence: in 1954, the dress she's wearing is "a steal" at $1,700. That's at least $30,000 today.<br /><br />He goes gallivanting all over the world to take pictures; she is strictly Park Avenue. She says she could get him great work doing portraits and fashion photography, but he hates the idea. What can they do?<br /><br />They can turn amateur detective watching Raymond Burr apparently murder his wife and cut her up into pieces!!!<br /><br />Of course, being a photographer and an outdoorsman, Stewart has binoculars and telephoto lenses. He also has a friend who is a detective. He tells his friend about his suspicions, and the friend is skeptical, but checks out the facts. It seems Burr has covered his tracks well enough that Stewart's friend decides there's been no murder. The wife just went on a visit in the country for her health.<br /><br />If I tell you any more, it will wreck it for you. And this is one mystery movie you really don't want wrecked for you. I loved it.</p></body></html>

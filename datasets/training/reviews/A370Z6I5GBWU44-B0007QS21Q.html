<meta name="summary" content="Decent film"></head><body><p>I haven't read the book that this movie was based off, so I have nothing to compare it with. Will Smith does a decent job as the protagonist, and the story is interesting and will keep you on your toes - who really killed the doctor? The answer may surprise you if you've not read the book. All in all a good movie, rent before you decide to buy it.</p></body></html>

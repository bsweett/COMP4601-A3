<meta name="summary" content="No More the Weather is the Bad Guy Movies....Please"></head><body><p>In the tradition of 'Twister' and 'The Perfect Storm,' where the good guys face off against Mother Nature, we now get 'The Day After the Tomorrow.'  The premise of the movie is as follows:  Jack Hall, a scientist played by Dennis Quaid, discovers that the polar ice caps are melting and the Atlantic current is disapating.  As a result, a new ice age is about to hit Earth.  To make matters worse, Jack's son, Sam, is caught in the middle of its path in New York while on an Academic Decathalon trip from his college.<br /><br />What this movie comes down to is just another disaster flick where on some level, the weather is suppose to be the bad guy.  Ultimately, the goal of the film might have been to get human's to look at what they are doing to the environment, as pollution is the ultimate culprit in making the polar icecaps melt.  However, its just hard to take this movie seriously and believe that in a manner of days, the icecaps could melt, the current could cease to exist, and the weather would go absolutely haywire.<br /><br />Hall's rescue attempt of his son isn't even compelling.  None of the characters are especially charismatic.  Sam has an action sequence that is really unnecessary, not very exciting, and almost laughable in the later half of the movie that only serves to prolong the lenghth of the film.<br /><br />I remember this movie being billed as 'The Movie that President Bush' doesn't want you to see (wait a minute, wasn't that Farenheit 9/11?).  I'm not sure why.  The omniboding apocalypse that is foreshadowed by the melting of the ice caps is so implausible that He couldn't have been worried.  Perhaps the critic that made that statement thought President Bush was concerned we would fall over laughing from the horrible CGI wolves in the end.<br /><br />I don't recommend this movie at all.  There were some excellent special effects in which Los Angeles was wiped out by Tornados, and New York was flooded and then frozen over.  After that, there isn't much to like in this movie.  If your interest is peaked, just rent the movie and stop watching about half way through.  However, I will note that my wife really enjoyed this movie, so I could be all wrong.<br /><br />NOTE TO HOLLYWOOD:  Please quit making movies where Mother Nature is the villain.  Nobody has done it right in a long, long time.</p></body></html>

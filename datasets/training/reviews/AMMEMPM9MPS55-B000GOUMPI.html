<meta name="summary" content="Frightening"></head><body><p>This film is disturbing and scary. It kept me on the edge of my seat for almost all of its two and a half hours running length. In Kubrick's tale things start to get spooky at a remote Colorado hotel, and as the characters discover they are trapped, so we discover we are trapped with them, shut up in an amazing labyrinth with an axe-wielding madman we have suddenly found out we cannot trust.<p>Music (mainly by the Hungarian composer Bela Bartok) and camerawork are the chief contributors to the atmosphere of a film which is one of the few genuinely frightening I have experienced.</p></body></html>

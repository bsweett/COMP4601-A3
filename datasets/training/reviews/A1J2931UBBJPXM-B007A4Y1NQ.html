And when he has to take a temporary job to  support his wife, Lotte (Diaz), it's the beginning of a bizarre interlude  that will ultimately take him, and a few others as well, into a realm  beyond the known.  Soon the question is, who is really pulling and  controlling the strings of whom?  Jonze has taken Kaufman's unique  screenplay, which is witty, humorous and totally engrossing, and made an  ingenious movie; in fact, there's never been anything quite like it.  It is  distinct and filled with nuance and subtle shades of humor, sometimes dark,  sometimes hilarious, but riveting throughout.  And the performances are  absolutely first rate all around.  Keener deservedly got the Oscar nod for  Best Supporting Actress, but Cusack, Diaz and Malkovich are also exemplary  here.  Cusack comes through with one of the best characters he's ever done;  there's an edgy, quiet intelligence to Craig, a Bohemian at heart, who is  reserved, generally takes things as they come, and exudes a certain boyish  charm.  He also has an apartment full of pets (snakes, birds and a chimp).  Diaz, taking on a decidedly unglamorous role, is terrific as Lotte, who is  somewhat unremarkable and works as a pet shop clerk.  It's a great  character part, and Diaz plays it for all it's worth, connecting with the  audience while ably conveying Lotte's sense of confusion and repressed  yearnings.  Malkovich (as himself) is the icing on the cake; he plays it  straight, with a finesse and distinction that makes the unbelievable  somehow credible, while lending an easy, natural flow to the innate humor  of the story.  The "Malkovich, Malkovich," sequence, and his rendition of  the "puppet's dance" are unforgettable scenes.  But character actor Orson  Bean (with his creation of the wry Dr. Lester), nearly steals the show with  a truly memorable performance; the scene in which he interviews  job-applicant Craig is classic.  The supporting cast includes Mary  Kay Place (absolutely hysterical as Floris), Charlie Sheen (Charlie),  Carlos Jacott (Larry), Willie Garson (Guy in restaurant) and Byrne Piven  (Captain Mertin).  "Being John Malkovich" is a movie that is an experience  in itself, and Jonze and his entire cast should be given a standing ovation  for bringing this one to life, for making it breathe.  It's the kind of  film you wait for to come along, but rarely does, and it demands to be seen  more than once; for when you've tasted such nectar as this, you simply have  to go back for more.</p></body></html>

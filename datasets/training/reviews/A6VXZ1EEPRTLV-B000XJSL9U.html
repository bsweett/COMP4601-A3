<meta name="summary" content="over a decade since the last time, and McClane is still tougher than most half his age . . ."></head><body><p>An eternity ago, Bruce Willis was the wisecracking David Addison on a TV show called Moonlighting.  Few could have imagined that Die Hard (1988), would propel Willis to megastardom, and launch a new genre of action/adventure imitators.  The sequels, Die Hard 2 (1990), and Die Hard With A Vengeance (1995) followed, but as Willis continued a colorful film career, the prospects for a fourth John McClane adventure seemed slim.  Fortunately, Live Free or Die Hard (2007) happened.  The 52 year old Willis, defies time, with an impressive, kickbutt performance, that leaves you wondering why it took so long, for something this good to happen.<br /><br />Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), a disgruntled computer security expert, is engaged in compromising key computer networks, and killing the hackers that have unknowingly been helping him.  McClane is still a NYC cop, but time has brought changes, including divorce, and a daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who is too angry to have a conversation with him.  McClane is sent to bring in Matt Farrell (Justin Long), one of geeks on Gabriel's payroll, preventing him from becoming a fatality.<br /><br />Gabriel continues his attack on various key systems, and looks to close a loose end, targeting Farrell with a helicopter strike.  The action sequence in a tunnel is impressive, although a police car taking down the chopper is too much.  Gabriel's girlfriend Mai Linh (Maggie Q), a computer tech and martial arts expert, is sent to manage the takeover of a power plant, and has a spectacular tussle with McClane in an elevator shaft.  Things get personal between McClane and Gabriel, as the terrorist grabs his daughter Lucy.  FBI deputy director Miguel Bowman (Cliff Curtis), provides law enforcement support, that is always a few steps behind.<br /><br />Directed by Ted Wiseman (Underworld), Live Free or Die Hard does a pretty good job of capturing the spirit of the Die Hard series, over the top adventures, with a larger than life hero, where realism is not that big a deal, as long as a certain level of credibility is maintained.  McClane is older, wiser, and as irreverent as ever, although with his advanced age and lack of technical savvy, the emphasis on youth is clear.  "That guy" Matt Farrell, makes a quirky, atypical sidekick.  Thomas Gabriel, doesn't have the gravitas of a Hans Gruber, but he makes a pretty formidable baddie, despite his youth.  And daughter Lucy is quite the spitfire.  The stunts, action sequences, and special effects, are up to par, with just the right touch of excess.  Fans of the franchise, should not be disappointed.<br /><br />The two disc version has a nice set of extras, including a commentary with Bruce Willis, Len Wiseman, and editor Nicholas de Toth, and a nice assortment of making of featurettes.  What happens next with the venerable John McClane, remains to be seen, but let's just hope that he has not yippee ki-yayed for the last time.</p></body></html>

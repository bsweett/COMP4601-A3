<meta name="summary" content="Pan's Labyrinth is a sobering movie..."></head><body><p>It won't make you feel good.  The horrors of war are, in fact, horrible.<br /><br />This is not a fairy tale with a happy ending.  The heroes don't live happily ever after.<br /><br />But a child's imagination always exists, even under the cruelest of circumstances.<br /><br />A brutal officer brings his pregnant wife and his stepdaughter to his garrison for the birth of their son.  In Spain, a civil war is raging in the aftermath of WWII.  The daughter discovers a fairy, and is lead to a faun, who tells here that her real father is a fairyland king, and that she is a princess.  She only need to complete three tasks to rediscover her heritage.  These actions are set among the battles between the soldiers and the rebels, and the poor men and women caught in between.  Will completion of these tasks deliver the stepdaughter from these horrors of war?<br /><br />How will you feel after viewing this haunting movie?  Three unique viewpoints:<br /><br />- "I am saddened about the realities of war, but hopeful and intrigued about the escape through fantasy."<br /><br />- "I got a little teary eyed toward the end, which was hard.  The musical score was really in sync with the mood of the film.<br /><br />- "War is bad.  War is BAD."<br /><br />The dialogue is in Spanish.  We viewed it with English subtitles.  The computer-generated animations are agonizingly realistic.<br /><br />Don't confuse this movie with those fantasies like Stardust (which is a great movie) that have you feeling uplifted by the finale.  This is a boo-hoo movie.  Haunting.  I'm listening to songs by Enya as I write this.  Very appropriate.  If you know Enya, this will make sense.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The scariest film ever made!"></head><body><p>I have always loved The Exorcist.The first time I watched it,it scared the hell out of me,particulary because I watched it in the dark.The next few times weren't scary,because I knew what was coming.But it still sent chills through my spine.The film begins with the elderly Father Merrin at an archeological dig,in which he finds an ancient demonic sculpture.He then knows that he must confront a great evil.Meanwhile,in Georgetown,Washington,young Regan is about to get a not-so-pleasant surprise.In the space of a n hour,she urinates on the rug,vomites on an unsuspecting preist,and uses profanity in ways we could not have thought a 12 year old could use.But,hey,anything's possible.You'll love this chiller/thriller/horror/suspense flick that I call sensational.</p></body></html>

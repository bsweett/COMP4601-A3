The plot is familiar, but the acting really elevates it above the average film it is. Jodie Foster turns in her best performance in quite some time and Terrence Howards is very good as well. It took me a while to get into the film, but once it got a hold of me it didn't let go. You will feel as abused as Jodie Foster's character by the time the credits role. A worthy DVD rental for sure, but you may want to pass seeing it in theaters.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

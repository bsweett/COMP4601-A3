For ten years now, Sy has given special attention to the Yorkin family. He's developed their film in under an hour, and even made sure to get an extra set of prints for himself. Poor Sy has no life at all. Each night he gets off work, drives his boring little car home to his dull little apartment, and watches tv. Sy has only one ray of sunshine in his otherwise gray existence. It is the Yorkin family. Over the years their pictures have become Sy's obsession. They have given him a sense of belonging and a reason to live. Sy has covered an entire wall with the Yorkin clan's photos. This collage represents their history with &quot;uncle&quot; Sy. One day, Sy gets called in to see his boss at Sav-mart. He's been busted for his decade worth of making (stealing) extra sets of pictures. Sy gets fired. What else is there for a man like Sy? While finishing out his final week, Sy runs across some pictures of Will Yorkin (head of Sy's adopted family) being romantic with another woman. Sy is outraged. His dream has been destroyed and he must face a reality he's spent a lifetime supressing. There are no perfect families. There are no perfect people. There are only human beings doing messy human things. This doesn't sit well with Sy, who sets out to teach his ex-boss and Will Yorkin a lesson in humility. Yep, the glue has dissolved, Sy's come apart, and he's on a rampage! What comes next is retribution for those who have dared to betray him. ONE HOUR PHOTO is a scary movie. It achieves a thickening atmosphere of dread without any cheap shots or unnecessary violence. Every crack in Sy's mind is tiny and subtle, until these cracks join together into one huge split. I thoroughly enjoyed Robin Williams' performance, as it was one of his most gratifying. Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

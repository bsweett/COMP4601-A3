<meta name="summary" content="Perhaps the best Kaufman movie"></head><body><p>With a title as wordy as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, you'd expect a meaty, heavy film.  But it's more than that.  Charting the story of Joel (Carrey), who upon discovering his ex Clementine (Winslet) has had her memory erased of him, decides to go through the process himself.  The only hitch is that halfway through the process, as he trawls backwards through his time with Clementine he wants to call the whole thing off.<p>It's difficult to descrive the story in full partly because it's more of a movie you have to see rather than hear described.  Suffice to say that as well as being tightly scripted by Kaufman, it's also directed with verve and passion and visually it's brilliant.  Any fans of Kaufman will absolutely love it, and in my mind this combines the wacky off-the-wall humour of Being John Malkovich with the humanity of Adaptation.  Whilst it's true that Kaufman's brand of comedy isn't perhaps as exciting as it was in Being John Malkovich, but let's face it, this is heaps better than the usual dross.  As a matter of fact, this is actually more poignant than the promotion would have you believe.  Not only is it stuffed full of literary allusions but the relationship between Joel and Clementine is sensitively drawn, as are the dynamics between the other characters.<p>The acting is also brilliant.  Carrey gives his most restrained, human performance yet, surpassing even The Truman Show with his glum, miserably, introverted Joel.  Winslet hits the big time again after a string of fantastic performances in lower budget affairs, and doesn't disappoint.  It's a credit to her that we never find Clementine annoying for a single moment.  Of the supporting players, Elijah Wood breaks out of the Frodo role by playing a loveable nerd and Mark Ruffalo shows that he can be a real asset to a film as long as he's given an interesting role.  The only real casting problem is Kirsten Dunst, who seems to have plateaued acting-wise after her dreamy performance in The Virgin Suicides.  Whilst she continues to pick good roles, she hasn't had anything to really test her for a while.<p>More than anything else though, with just a few movies, Kaufman has proved to be a big name in intelligent, interesting movies and one that can even rescue the term 'romantic comedy' from out of the doldrums.  Eternal Sunshine is near-perfect and will definitely be one of the highlights of this year's films.</p></body></html>

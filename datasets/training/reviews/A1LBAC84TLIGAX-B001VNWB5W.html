After all, it is considered to be one of the greatest novels ever and you will receive extreme backlash if you ruin it. Had this film not received the right group of people to do it, it would have ended up being a modern-day <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790732912">Batman & Robin</a>. People have still not forgiven Joel Schumacher for that effort even after 12 years. Watchmen, in my opinion is the most faithful film adaptation of any book, game, or movie remake adaptation ever made. Sure there have been plenty of great comic adaptations as of late such as;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTX">Sin City</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QC4">The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C08RHA">Iron Man (Single-Disc Edition)</a>, and more, but this easily stands as the greatest comic adaptation I've ever seen, and one of the greatest films I've ever seen, period.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The year is 1985, during the Cold War when tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union are ever growing and the possibility of war is evident. President Nixon is running for a fifth term in office, and we won the Vietnam war thanks to a band of heroes known as the "Watchmen" who were banned by the Keene Act in 1977. When an old super hero known as The Comedian is murdered, the other old Watchmen members band together to solve this murder and along the way unravel a series of shocking discoveries in a plot to kill these heroes and destroy the world along the way. Meanwhile, the world is on edge as nuclear wars comes closer and closer to fruition. Can the Watchmen save the world? Watch this superb film and find out.<br />MUSIC: The music in this film is simply amazing. Ranging from Tyler Bates's amazing score, to the numerous great old songs played throughout, this another highlight in this incredible experience. I have no gripes at all with this area.<br />ACTING: Although this film uses a cast of unknown people (The only person I recognized was Carla Gugino who was on Sin City), these actors fit their roles perfectly. These actors were absolutely fantastic and performed their roles superbly and flawlessly. I can't think of any actors would have performed these roles better.<br />ACTION: This film is a mostly story-driven experience, but when the action starts up, it can be rather brutal and gory in terms of violence. This is certainly not for kids and it earns its R-rating with no problem. The film had plenty of excitement throughout thanks to the wonderfully scripted action sequences. This film also features what some have referred to as a "gratuitous" scene of sexuality which makes this film definitely targeted to an adult audience. Not to mention, no one who sees this film is ever going to forget Dr. Manhattan's genitals (Does this glowing blue guy really need to be naked all the time?). This film will not disappoint those who are up some pretty cool action scenes and adult-only content.<br />OVERALL: This film is a must-have if you love comic book films, or you like films that really make you think (This film does teach moral values along the way). And if you buy this film, only buy the Director's Cut because this version is 24 minutes longer than the original version. This film is an absolutely fantastic, superb, and sublime experience. However, if you get bored easily, I would not recommend this to you because this version is three hours long. Buy this film now, dammit.<br />THE GOOD: Virtually everything.<br />THE BAD: Why is Dr. Manhattan almost always nude?</p></body></html>

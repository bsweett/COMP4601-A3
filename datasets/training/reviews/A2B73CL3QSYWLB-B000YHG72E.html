<meta name="summary" content="Who's Your Buddy?"></head><body><p>"Elf" is one of those rare films that is impervious to criticism.  It is a fun and funny film that espouses the spirit of Christmas and actually means it.  As a counterpoint, just recall "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" of a few years ago, a film that allegedly was about the commercialism of the holiday yet wholeheartedly embraced said consumerism.  Credit has to be given to Will Ferrell who jumps into the role of Buddy, the human adopted by elves, with reckless, yet sweet, comic abandonment.  Buddy is essentially a man-child, but Ferrell makes his belief in the spirit of Christmas infectious.  James Caan does an amusing turn as Buddy's slow-burning gruff biological father.  And it's nice to see old-pros like Bob Newhart and Ed Asner as Papa Elf and Santa Clause, respectively.  Peter Dinklage has an amusing cameo as an ill-tempered children's author.  Credit has to go to director John Favreau for not going saccharine, or, even worse, making this a cynical exercise.  I'm not sure if this is classic stuff, but it'll do.  One quibble is some of the off-color humor was superfluous, but that will probably go over younger viewers heads.</p></body></html>

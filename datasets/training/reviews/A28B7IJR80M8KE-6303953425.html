<meta name="summary" content=""Say what again", I dare you, say what again"!!!"></head><body><p>When I first saw this film in 1995, I didn't quite get it, since then I have gotten almost all of Quentin Taratino's films ("Jackie Brown", "Deathproof", "Kill Bill 1 & 2", "From Dusk til Dawn") & now this one, why I ignored this one for so long I don't know, AMC aired it recently & I found myself enjoying it much more than I did in 1995, & had to get it too, Taratino is the kind of filmaker that Hollywood used to have many of, but no longer has anymore, his writing style really jumps out at you, Samuel L.Jackson is at his usual best, no one can swear like Jackson, his swearing makes me laugh every time, I have just about all of his films, he is definately one of my favorite actors that I feel doesn't get the recognition he deserves most of the time, & Taratino revived John Travolta's career here just as he revived the late David Carradine's in "Kill Bill", even Michael Keaton & Robert DeNiro took a pay cut to work with Taratino on "Jackie Brown", & I think Bruce Willis did too on this one, anyway in this one, you have three interwoven stories with Jackson & Travolta as hitmen for Ving Rhames(Con-Air, Dark Blue) who is a  boxing promoter who is married to Uma Thurman (Kill Bill), with Bruce Willis as a boxer who crosses Rhames after refusing to throw a fight, but the real highlight is Jackson & Travolta's moments, the one with Taratino himself, the one with Harvey Keitel as a fixer somewhat, & especially the diner sequence where Jackson belittles a would be robber (Tim Roth), I get this one now, I think what I didn't like when I first saw it, was the mixing up of scenes, but now I get it, & this is definately Taratino's crown jewel, & a must own DVD!</p></body></html>

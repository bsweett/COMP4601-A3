<meta name="summary" content="Entertainment X"></head><body><p>This film maintains the standard set by its predecessor. The secret of both the first two movies is giving Sir Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart plenty of screen time. Notionally Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is the lead character, and he is good, but it is the sometime Shakespearean actors who give these films the touch of class that many comic strip films lack. Add in the ever reliable Brian Cox and you actually have a classy cast.<br /><br />My favourite scene is Magneto's escape from his plastic prison, which is perhaps the highpoint of the film. This scene looks as if its came straight from the comic book form and it works perfectly on film as well. Bryan Singer, who also directed the first film, keeps the excitement levels high throughout, without going completely over the top.<br /><br />I felt the film was a little to long, but that aside, I found it an entertaining film that holds up to repeated viewings.</p></body></html>

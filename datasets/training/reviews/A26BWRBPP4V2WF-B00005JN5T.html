<meta name="summary" content="Doesn't work as well as the first, but does have some great moments"></head><body><p>The film that preceded this, Meet the Parents, was an exercise in situational comedy.  The jokes grew naturally out of the moments and the personalities established by the characters.  It also had a feel of truth to it - even if Jack (Robery De Niro) was ex-CIA (which most parents aren't), he was mainly a Dad looking out for his daughter.  In Meet the Fockers, we meet the groom-to-be's set of parents.  That they must somehow contrast with the uptight New England nouveau riche Byrneses goes without saying.  Unfortunately, they are too over-the-top to allow much in the way of "truth" in the characters' personalities.<br /><br />That's not to say that such a film could not be funny, and the most delightful bits in Meet the Fockers are, in fact, those between the Focker family themselves - the hippy stay-at-home free spirit Dad (Dustin Hoffman), the hippy sex-therapist Mom (Barbara Streisand), and their eternally embarrassed son Gaylord "call me Greg" Focker (Ben Stiller).  There are also some great moments featuring the Byrnes family - the yearning of Mom for the kind of physical connection with her husband that the Fockers have for each other, and the continuing battle between Greg and the Byrnes patriarch.  Unfortunately, the screen gets filled up with too many alpha-male (and female) actors (Hoffman, Stiller, Streisand, and De Niro) that there is no time to develop the interrelationships to the point where the comedy pays off.  This is made worse because time needed to be made for Jinx (the cat) and his new nemesis, the Focker chihuahua.  But the most fatal mistake is the inclusion of Jack's grandson (by his second daughter) who makes the trip with them.  Again, he has some very funny scenes, but he exposes the script as sacrificing character for plot points - the Fockers should be delighted at the efforts Jack has made to bond with his grandson, because that was their philosophy in raising Greg.  Instead, they ridicule him for the sake of cheap laughs that diminish their characters.<br /><br />Still, when the screen isn't overcrowded by all these stars vying for time, there are some great jokes, and the third act almost returns to the kind of situational comedy of the first.  It may not be as enjoyable as the first film, but if you did enjoy Meet the Parents, you will not be wasting your time Meeting the Fockers.</p></body></html>

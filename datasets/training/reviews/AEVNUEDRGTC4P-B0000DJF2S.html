<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good, But A Bit Too Long"></head><body><p>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was based on a pretty good graphic novel and as a movie, its pretty good itself.  Where else  could you ever hope to see the likes of Captain Nemo, Dorin Gray, Mina Harker, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde, Allan Quatermain & Tom Sawyer all in the same movie?  About the only character the production is lacking is Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />The action and special effects in this movie are outstanding as are the performances from most of the actors.  The only real drawback is the length.  About 30 minutes could be excised from this movie without deleting any key scenes.<br /><br />All in all, a good popcorn flick.</p></body></html>

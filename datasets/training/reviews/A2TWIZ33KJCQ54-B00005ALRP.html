<meta name="summary" content="AN ACTION SUSPENSE THRILLER WITH A PLOT"></head><body><p>'THE FUGITIVE' REMINDS ME OF 'NORTH BY NORTHWEST' - THE 'WRONG MAN' THEME GREATLY ACCELERATED<br /><br />'North by Northwest' featured Cary Grant who had been a huge star, especially at the box-office, a lot like Harrison Ford, the star of "The Fugitive." Instead of the bi-plane that flies into and causes the gas tanker to explode with Cary Grant racing from the scene, we've got the mother of all train wrecks which Harrison Ford literally leaps from a nanosecond prior to impact!<br /><br />THERE IS A LOT MORE TO 'THE FUGITIVE' THAN JUST CHASE SCENES<br /><br />Richard Kimble did not kill his wife. We knew that when we entered the theatre because we had all heard of the TV series by that name and some of us even saw the hourly mystery program when it ran in the 1960s. We knew about the one-armed man, the conviction of Dr. Kimble, and his quest to prove that a one-armed man had committed the horrific deed.<br /><br />'THE FUGITIVE' DELIVERS SURPRISES + SUSPENSE & RESOLUTION TOO<br /><br />Somehow this seemingly very tired theme came alive and grabbed my attention very early. Although I found the opening sequence a bit lurid and disturbing, it was captivating nevertheless. With an obvious sense of pacing, the trial of Dr. Richard Kimble was as rapid [on-screen] as a disclosure of the basic facts of Mrs. Kimble's murder allowed.<br /><br />From Kimble's conviction, we are jettisoned to the biggest and most visceral TRAIN WRECK sequence I have ever seen on film. More importantly, it established sympathy for Kimble as he not only barely escaped death, but he saved one of the guards in the process. This incredible action sequence led directly to the introduction of Tommy Lee Jones as Deputy Marshall Sam Gerard and the unbelievable chase scenes that followed.<br /><br />The action sequences and suspense are so genuine that even the mundane scenes, like when Kimble was going through the one-armed man's private papers, were intense. No matter how many times I watch this film, I am amazed by how enthralled I am with the action and characters, despite knowing the complete storyline. I dare say that even the Master of Suspense himself couldn't have done better!<br /><br />----- THE ACTORS -<br /><br />Harrison Ford - Dr. Richard Kimble<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones - Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard<br /><br />Sela Ward - Helen Kimble<br /><br />Joe Pantoliano - Cosmo Renfro<br /><br />Jeroen Krabbe - Dr. Charles Nichols<br /><br />Julianne Moore - Dr. Anne Eastman<br /><br />Andreas Katsulas - Sykes "One Armed Man"<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD: SPECIAL EDITION - WIDESCREEN - DIGITAL TRANSFER<br /><br />Digital transfer in Widescreen.

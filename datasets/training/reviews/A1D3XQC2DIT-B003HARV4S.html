<meta name="summary" content="It's no illusion, this is a good movie."></head><body><p>You may have heard and/or read the same mix of reviews that I had before I had seen The Illusionist. Some people could nod their heads at it and tell you it was entertaining. Others would hesitate, only to be polite, and say it just wasn't worth seeing. In my experience, not many people had very strong feelings one way or the other. And many people preferred to focus on whether or not it was better than The Prestige instead of discussing the movie on its own merits. I won't claim the moral high-ground, admittedly I have not seen The Prestige; all I have to go on is The Illusionist. And I liked it.<br /><br />The casting is better than luke-warm. The movie features the on-the-rise career of Paul Giamatti and the long-overdue return of Ed Norton. Giamatti acted his way onto the map with a highly praised performance in American Splendor, though he is probably most well-known for his role in the Sideways. If you have read my reviews before, this may not be the first time you see me point to the movie Confidence. It is the movie to which I would say Paul Giamatti's role is most comparable (and one of my favorite movies). In both movies he toes the line between the moral and immoral, while bringing a strong breadth of character. In the Illusionist he has a larger part, so you are able to enjoy his very-likeable personality in greater supply.<br /><br />Edward Norton has delivered some very noteworthy performances over his career. I can only wish for him to get more work; I enjoy what he does. He does not seem to work at the same pace as many in-demand actors today. Maybe he prefers more time off, or maybe I am the lone voice of support for his career. Either way, I thought he did a great job as lead in The Illusionist, where he brought the same "I'm better than you" arrogance that he gave us in Rounders. It seemed effortless as he settled into a character who is not too over-the-top. Knowledge is power, and his character knew what others did not.<br /><br />The story was a new flavor of an old dish. The creators here took the often-used template for a crescendo of suspense which carries you safely into the heart of an exhilarating plot twist. What they added was magic, literally. (Sure it was good, but you know what I mean.) I really enjoy magicians and their craft. I liked the way the creative team for The Illusionist was able to bring this story to life. The only thing I longed for was more magic. A few more slight-of-hand tricks would have made me very happy, though I understand that there wasn't necessarily any good place for them to be added.<br /><br />I hope that you are neither too proud of yourself, nor disappointed should you predict the twist. The strength of the movie is less in the surprise and more in the execution. The Illusionist is not a movie you will love, but I think if you give it a fair chance, you will be entertained.</p></body></html>

How is that possible?  And why does Lord Kitchener and the actor Tim Curry also bear such a strong resemblance to the aforementioned English King and Russian Czar?  After Okinawa was invaded and their king forced to falsely claim that the archipelago nation was long a part of Japan, why did the royal families of South East Asia systematically disappear and what really happened to the true royal family of Corea?  How is it that most of the world's royal families disappeared by the time of World War 2 after the Archduke Ferdinand was probably murdered by his own royal connections because the young Yugoslavian shooter didn't believe that his broken gun actually fired although he was glad that the assassination happened because the Austro-Hungarian/German call it whatever you want - it's the same bad guy - had enslaved the Balkans.  They had no business being in that country.  There was a second shooter but not on the grassy knoll in Texas.  The Rose Line is the line that runs through Beijing aligned to the North Star and Mao Tse Tung has a missing child who was hidden with the Miao aka Hmong ethnic minority tribe during the Long March.  Da Vinci Code is about hiding the sons (AND the daughters) of rulers to prevent forced marriages such as the one to the Austrian Marie Antoinette whose divorce could only be brought about by the French Revolution.  The Scarlet Pimpernel saved aristocrats but not her.  She's the most famous beheading of the French Revolution.  And nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition or St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre; why?  Those Cambodians don't look defensive about the killing fields but those piles of skulls ECHO the skulls of native Taiwanese that the Japanese did to intimidate the surviving population of Taiwan when they invaded and held Taiwan during WW2.  We are being shown ECHOES to keep the crimes yet to be punished alive in our minds.</p></body></html>

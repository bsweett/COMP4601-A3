I agree with Stallone in feeling that there is a shortage of these types of films in general, let alone descent ones; the last good one I can remember offhand, being The Punisher (2004).<br /><br />Angelina Jolie has impressed me and no doubt Stallone as well, with her latest film Salt, where she shows that it doesn't take a man to walk into a room and kill everyone; she can do it too. And man, does she do it; with skill, style and sex appeal. Short of maybe Charlize Theron, no other actress could have pulled this role off.<br /><br />She is Evelyn Salt. She's a spy for the CIA. Or is she? A dangerous looking Russian man walks himself into the CIA headquarters to report that a Russian Spy living in America, will assassinate the president of Russia, during his visit to the states. Ready for the kicker? The creepy Russian man leers at Evelyn from across the interview table and informs her that she is said Russian Spy / future assassin!<br /><br />You can imagine the look of shock on the faces of her comrades, who are taping the interview from the next room; not to mention Evelyn's. Sadly, that's all I can divulge to you. Trust me, there's so much more to tell, that it's killing me not to - but you'll have to see it for yourself! Twist and turn after twist and turn. Some you may see coming, others you probably will not. Either way - you will have a blast watching her run for her life; the filmmakers leaving us in limbo as to whether we should be rooting for her or not.<br /><br />The film is over the top, sure. At times it's even a tad irritating, having you sitting there going, `Oh, come on." A knife being snuck into the CIA headquarters; unnoticed information on CIA agents' background checks; the Whitehouse being penetrated as easily as a few 17-year-olds sneaking into a frat party; leaps from helicopters and freeways and moving vehicles, and etc., etc. My personal favorite would be Jolie (to quote Woody, from Toy Story), "falling with style", down an elevator shaft, passing several floors with each jump, and grabbing onto a ledge just right each time. This is something they should have had her do in the Lara Croft movies, as it was done in the videogames; but they didn't, so never mind.<br /><br />Speaking of videogames, Salt could make a very interesting one indeed and I wouldn't be surprised if the movie is followed by a sequel. Videogames? Sequels? `One girl killin' everyone?" I know - sounds like it could be a too much, but the film works. It's very cleverly written and directed, and Jolie's butt kicking action scenes are matched evenly throughout the film, with dramatic ones sharing brilliant acting from her two co-stars, Live Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor.<br /><br />Schreiber and Ejiofor both play CIA operatives that work with Salt, and are tasked with tracking her down when she has fled. Neither of them is entirely sure if they should trust her alleged innocence, as the film hurls them after her through suspenseful stimulated action chase scenes close to the flavor of those in The Fugitive and Enemy of the State.<br /><br />Director Phillip Noyce and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer know this genre like the back of their hand and the film proves it. A list of their best achievements would be unrelenting; but a short version between the two of them could include Law Abiding Citizen, Street Kings, The Bone Collector, Patriot Games and The Saint.<br /><br />In closing, having enjoyed the film a great deal, but also having pointed out how un-plausible some of the events were, I feel the need to defend it one last time. I can say that I have definitely seen action films that have pushed the envelope of believability a lot further than Salt, and offered us only phony acting in return to justify their means. At least most of the elements in this film could maybe happen; and the performances of the actors, only add believability to us finding those things being possible.</p></body></html>

He's made two movies that I'm quite fond of that are full of action, scares and laughs (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXS">Jurassic Park III</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000031EGV">Jumanji</a>), so I figured that with Johnston at the helm for Captain America, we might be in for more of the same. The trailer for Captain America sure made it seem like at least the action would be there, but ultimately I found Captain America to be very slow-moving and the weakest entry among the movies that have been introducing us to next year's Avengers.<br /><br />I admit that I had a preconceived notion about Captain America way before the pre-Avengers movies even started to get made, and my preconceived notion was that Captain America was outdated and quite frankly boring. That was until sometime back in 2008 when I read all 800 pages combined of Mark Millar's epic collections of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785110828">The Ultimates</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785121382">The Ultimates 2</a>. Those books were nothing short of amazing, and those books introduced me to the Marvel gang in a whole new light, especially Captain America (and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034G4P8A">Thor</a>). Thor quickly became one of my favorite Marvel characters after reading Millar's books, and similarly I gained an entirely new respect for Captain America because of Millar's books. The integrity of Millar's delivery of Captain America is somewhat still in place with Johnston's Captain America; there's just something about Johnston's that made him into more of a campy, corny kind of character that left me unsatisfied by the end of the film.<br /><br />Captain America is a bizarro period piece mostly set in the early 40s that documents Captain America's making and rise. So I think that the campy, corny part of his personality that Johnston instilled was deliberate and meant to suggest it was sort of the natural disposition of a lot of people back then. But for me it just came across as rather droll. Surprisingly, with a cast that includes some other greats like Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving, you'd think that the drollness might be made up for by stellar acting. But if you ask me, those guys are gravely underused in Captain America.<br /><br />Look, if you want to see the birth of Captain America and keep the continuity of the introduction of the Avengers prior to next year's Avengers blockbuster, I certainly don't recommend skipping Captain America. But if you want to read a MUCH better story with Captain America in a key role read Millar's books.</p></body></html>

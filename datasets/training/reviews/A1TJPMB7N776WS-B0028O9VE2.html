<meta name="summary" content="Paz Means Peace"></head><body><p>John Clasky (Adam Sandler) has a problem, well actually he has two: one is his freaked out wife, Deborah (Tea Leoni) who is in desperate need of Prozac to control her mood swings, and her general bumping off the walls in a kind of early mid-life crisis, I lost-my-job, woe-is-me, I'm just a soccer Mom now, what-am-I gonna do panic.<br /><br />John's other problem is that he very well may be in love with the new Nanny, Flor (Paz Vega) who is every thing that Deborah is not: warm, loving and caring.<br /><br />John Brooks (TV's "Mary Tyler Moore Show," "As Good As it Gets") in a rare for him, miss-fire has made a film that is just not very funny: the writing is average and most of the performances are barely present. That is except for Leoni as Deborah whose performance is so whacked out and out of control; we can only blame Brooks for the miscalculation. In previous films ("Flirting With Disaster," "Hollywood Ending") Leoni has been witty, smart even Katherine Hepburn-ish. But here the material she has to work with and Brooks direction have her saying and doing things to her family that are just plain thoughtless on the plus side and ugly on the negative. Brooks: this is not "Ordinary People," this is a Comedy!!!<br /><br />On the positive side, Paz Vega as Flor fills the screen with warmth and sensuality and a hell of a lot of horse sense: something truly lacking in the Clasky household. She is a real find and she brings a needed stability to the proceedings. Sandler plays his regular guy, put-upon schlump here and as usual he does a good job.<br /><br />"Spanglish" is a minor blip in the career that is James Brook's but the one thing of which it will always be remembered is the introduction of the luminous and incandescent Paz Vega to the American screen.</p></body></html>

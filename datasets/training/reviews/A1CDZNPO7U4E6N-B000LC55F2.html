I saw it as a preview while I was waiting until the movie I paid to see began. Frankly, at this point, I'm thinking..right? A movie about magicians, that should be interesting. I'm glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how good this was. There isn't too much that I can say that hasn't already been said, but this movie isn't for simple minds. I actually had to watch this movie at least 3 times, and each time, I discovered something new. You really have to pay close attention to this one because if you miss anything you will be lost. I don't wanna spoil the ending, but depending on the person, I guess it could be interpreted 3 different ways. However, I wanna get to the meat of the story. This movie is about 2 magicians, Robert Angier, played by Hugh Jackman, and Alfred Borden, played by Christian Bale. Robert is known as "The Great Danton", and he obviously has more showmanship than fellow magician. Alfred is known as "The Professor", and he obviously is known for obviously being the better magician, but with no stlye. At any rate, a magic trick goes horribly wrong, and results in the death of Angier's wife for which he blames Borden. Thus, starting the fued of all fueds, the rivalry of all rivalries. They now dedicate themselves to destroying each other's lives. That includes everything from stealing each others tricks to sabatoging each others magic shows. This movie is ultimately about revenge, and how that revenge turns into an ugly obsession, and how that obsession can consume your entire life, and that usually leads to death, destruction, and misery for all parties involved. The cast is amazing, Michael Caine is a delight to see as always. Christian Bale's character is dark as ever just like most of his roles in everything from "American Psycho" to "Batman Begins". With that being said, in the end, you can't feel sorry for any of these characters because they brought this misery on themselves by not being able to accept a loss, and walk away. Although, it's hard to tell in the end who ultimately has the last laugh so to speak. Ultimately, they both deserved each other, and they both deserved what they got. I will tell you this..spoiler! When watching this movie keep in mind that the beginning is indeed the end, and the end does indeed explain what you see in the beginning. So, it is reversed, but if you pay close attention you'll see that hindsight is 20/20 vision, so they are giving you clues to the ending the entire movie hence the line..."Are you watching closely?" The ending also leaves you thinking about whether or not real magic does exist. I almost forgot to say that David Bowie is in this movie, and I couldn't even recognize him at first. David is always a sight to see, and he does play the great Nikola Tesla quite classy and elegant.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A harsh lesson about the naivety of youth and broken homes"></head><body><p>This film is interesting enough to hold your attention throughout and although there are some magical moments there is an overwhelming amount of tragic ones. There are messages and life lessons but there is also much meaningless behind it as a young man opts out from the rat race to try and survive in the wild but usually returns to the streets or country as a homeless vagrant before trying once again to survive the roughest of places. Each time he goes out into the wild the ruthless conditions he chooses escalate. He hopes eventually to reach Alaska for the purest wild experience he can have.<br /><br />Ultimately the film is about the people that the boy meets on his journey and the advice they give him and the stories they have to tell. It is also about his parents and family back home that have lost him probably due to their own domestic issues and failure to communicate. It is more than a bit of a disturbing worldview.<br /><br />Into the Wild is worth watching and has an art-house indie feel but is quite a depressing one because its stars are mostly down and outs and lonely. Its message could well be get a job, have a family and enjoy your 9 to 5 as much as it is about trying to be original no matter what it takes. It's a strange one and in a few ways I wish maybe I could unwatch it. Maybe it helps us become more aware of the destitute problem and for that it can be commended, but at the same time you feel very uncomfortable watching the downward spiral of its main protagonist because it is a corkscrew into misery that he is choosing. The ending is shocking and horrific not because it is so graphic but because there is poetry in the distress.</p></body></html>

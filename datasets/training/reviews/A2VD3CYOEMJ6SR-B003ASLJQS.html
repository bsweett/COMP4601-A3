<meta name="summary" content="Career performances for Robbins and Penn"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood recently won the Oscar for best director in Million Dollar Baby and, in this earlier effort, he showed how superb he is. He had won an Oscar also, in 1992, for Unforgiven and this movie was snadwiched between the two and, truthfully, was as solid an effort as the other two were. Meanwhile, both Sean Penn, winning best actor, and Tim Robbins, winning best supporting actor, were totally convincing. The odd man out was Kevin Bacon, who played a boyhood friend of the other two and was now a police detective. As great as he was, his role did not appear to be as demanding as those of Penn, who plays a low level hood in working class Boston, and of Robbins, who is an emotionally damaged victim of a kidnapping/sexual abuse episode decades earlier when he was a child.<br /><br />The story revolves around the three who are brought together following the brutal murder of Jimmy's daughter. Robbins, whose character's name is Davey, seems pretty much to be a nonentity. He is emotionally damaged from his horrible childhood experience and he is pretty much just a guy who hangs out in the neighborhood. Although he has a wife and son, he bears the scars of the earlier event. There are questions about Davey, however. The detective, played by Bacon and his partner, played by Laurence Fishburne investigate information that Davey was one of the last people to see Jimmy's daughter, the night she was killed after she came into a bar while Davey was drinking. Before long, the possibility that it was Davey is written off. However, Davey, haunted by his past, is uneasy about that night. Was he involved in the killing after all or, perhaps, did something unrelated happen? This is the mystery which must be solved.<br /><br />Ulitimately, there is a resolution but, this is no feel good movie so, this resolution is not necessarily satisfying. But then again, often life isn't always satisfying and what is portrayed is a gritty realism. I can't reveal any more about the events without ruining the suspense but I can add that at the very end, there is a parade scene and Jimmy's life seems to be getting on, almost as if he is able to compartmentalize and not be deeply effected by events. This emotional distance is a bit disturbing as there seems to an unforgivable detachment. But then, like I said, in real life, endings are not always what we wish them to be.<br /><br />Now, some editorial comment. There is often debate as to whether an actor should be nominated for an Oscar as best actor or best supporting actor. Robbin's role was major yet, he was nominated for and won best supporting actor. If he had been nominated in the best actor category, he would have lost to Penn. Penn's role was the pre-eminent role but, Robbins played a role that was nearly as pivotal. It is certainly a wonder as to how the academy splits hairs between a lead role and a supporting role. It could easily be argued that Penn, Robbins and Bacon shared the lead roles and were not supporting actors. A little more editorial comment: Penn and Robbins are among the most politically outspoken members of the Hollywood elite. On a personal basis, I do not like either one. Having said that, I have the deepest respect for their acting abilities and my personal feelings do not weigh in. I feel that they were both very deserving Oscar winners (given the fact that Robbins was in the supporting actor category).</p></body></html>

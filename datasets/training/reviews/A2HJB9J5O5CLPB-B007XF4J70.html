<meta name="summary" content="She Had To Walk Into Mine"></head><body><p>I watch this one once a year.  I can't help but notice recently that it is basically a propaganda film in behalf of the American war effort during WW2.  In less capable hands than the legendary Epstein brothers the script could have deteriorated into a jingoistic John Wayne, kill the Germans, flick.  Instead, it gives us some of the snappiest dialogue of American Cinema and the most romantic love story.<br /><br />Bogart's Rick is an American icon.  The tough guy with a broken heart bleeds whiskey.  Ingrid Bergman has hurt him.  She scoots when her husband Laslo, the resistance hero is found to be alive.  Rick retreats to a bistro in Casablanca, last stop for Europe's refuges.  Claude Rains plays the flip flopping Frenchy commandant.  Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorie, and a host of Hollywood character actors populate the back lot of Hollywood Morocco.  Every one of them gives the performance of their life.  It's almost like they knew this movie would be very special.<br /><br />Will Ingrid get on that plane with hero Laslo or a hero of love, Bogey?  This is a tough one for the women in the audience.  Convention says she should go with her husband.  He's a brave and kind man.  Or should she stay with capable, tough, unbelievably romantic Bogey?<br /><br />Round up the usual suspects and play it again, Sam.</p></body></html>

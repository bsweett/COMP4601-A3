Why?  Well for starters it's really what made Al Pucino famous.  Sure, he was in `The Godfather' films and he was brilliant in them (the Oscar nods prove that) but to me `The Godfather' belongs to Brando, but `Scarface', not that is in all respects Al's picture, from start to finish, it belongs to Pucino.<br /><br />Pucino plays Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant in the United States who goes from petty criminal to drug lord.  He double crosses, gets double crossed, gains respect, losses respect and does a lot of coke.  Throughout the film Tony can always rely on his best friend Manny (Steven Bauer), that is until Manny starts second guessing Tony's way of operation, and even more so starts seeing Tony's sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) even after Tony forbade it.  His sister Gina and his love for her (and wonton control of her life) is in the end what ruins this man.<br /><br />My favorite performance though came from Michelle Pfeiffer who plays Elvira Hancock, the wife of Tony's business partner who he eventually steals away and marries himself.  She is fascinated with the life (as is shown by her constant snorting habits) but she is also growing tired of Tony's ways so much so that she is beginning to resent him and everything he stands for.<br /><br />Al does a wonderful job with infusing Tony with the right amount of passion and drive to offset his cocky arrogance.  No, the acting isn't top notch award worthy acting (his accent is terrible) but he has so much fun with his performance that in a way it's legendary.  Tony Montana will go down in history as an icon of cinema, someone that all generations are drawn to and `Scarface' as a whole will always be remembered, regardless of what the Academy thinks.</p></body></html>

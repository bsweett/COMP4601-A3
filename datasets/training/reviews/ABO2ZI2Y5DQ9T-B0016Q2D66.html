<meta name="summary" content="(2.5 STARS) A Very Long Road"></head><body><p>Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, stars of "Titanic," reunite for the first time in eleven years for "Revolutionary Road," but their new film's tone is far from romantic. That is no surprise as the film is directed by Sam Mendes, known for his "American Beauty" and "Road to Perdition," and when the critics and reviewers say "Revolutionary Road" is a depressing film, they are exactly telling you the truth.<br /><br />The real point is, however, that depressing mood comes not from the nature of the story itself - see what happened to Jack at the end of "Titanic." It was sad, but not depressing. No, the film's depressing tone comes from seeing too much of unhappy characters who choose to be depressing.<br /><br />Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio play a married couple April and Frank, who settle in a beautiful house on "Revolutionary Road" in the mid-50s. After the brief scene of April's disastrous amateur stage production, we realize their married life is not going well.<br /><br />I am not particularly against the film's vision about American dream turned nightmare. The problem for me is that "Revolutionary Road" overstates the point. The characters talk much about themselves. Their efforts are all fertile. What they do is meaningless. Life is miserable and empty. They are not happy even having affairs with someone else. OK, their life is hollow, I know, but what else does the film offer besides what we realize in the first 30 minutes?<br /><br />The acting of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio is fine. And throughout the film we are aware that they are acting. Their acting is too good (or serious) for these characters they play, which rather belong to melodramatic world. This is why Michael Shannon (deservedly nominated for Oscar) steals every scene from them as a mentally troubled teacher, who relentlessly tells these characters what we have already known. His character has a mystery, or originality, that "Revolutionary Road" ultimately needs.</p></body></html>

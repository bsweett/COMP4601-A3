<meta name="summary" content="Strong performances from Paltrow and Hopkins"></head><body><p>Gwyneth Paltrow returns to high drama after experimenting with some other material.  A highly respected actress she finds her niche in this role with no trouble.  She played the part on stage and obviously has it down cold.<br /><br />The story starts with her character seeing visions of her father (Sir Anthony Hopkins) who recently died.  He was a brilliant mathematician who slipped into mental illness for a short time.  He recovered briefly but then regressed back.  During his regression and before his death, the two of them, sharing the same intellect, spoke of doing the greatest Proof ever.<br /><br />The main idea of the story is her fear of inheriting her fathers mental illness.  Particularly when it looks like she may have tried to plagiarize his work.  Her sister does not make it easier due to her thinking she slipping away as well, just as their father did.  She attempts to take control of her life and get her the `help' she needs.<br /><br />The performances in this movie are top notch.  Paltrow proves once again she has range beyond many of her peers.  Gyllenhaal continues to gain notoriety with strong roles like this and Brokeback mountain, making him one of the best young actors out there as well.  And there's always Sir Anthony Hopkins, reliable as ever, giving an outstanding performance.  The chemistry between him and Paltrow is the best thing about the movie.<br /><br />Although the dramatic element draws on the `Proof', it's mostly just a shell of a reason to get these characters together for the performances that they give.  Underneath the drama is something of an empty shell.  We don't really care about the Proof and it could be emphasized a little less.  But in any case, it is an integral part of the story.</p></body></html>

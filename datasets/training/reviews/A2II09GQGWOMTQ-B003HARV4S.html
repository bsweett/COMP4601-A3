Ho hum.<br />Not nearly as good as The Prestige, but if your looking for a solid movie based on magic then this movie is a good place to start.<br />Did I mention Ed Norton is one of the HOTTEST geeks on earth?<br />And can somebody tell me where he got that long black coat?<br />Still.......awesome movie!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The best horror film to come along in years"></head><body><p>Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, The Beach) directs this horror film, which is everything that is proclaimed by the review tagline on the back of the DVD package.  28 Days Later is the most visionary horror film to come along in years, thanks in part to some excellent performances from everyone involved, a super creepy atmosphere that is more than believable, and a refreshing take on the zombie genre.  When Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes out of a coma, he finds the hospital, along with just about all of England, deserted and abandoned.  Soon enough, he finds out why, and with the help of a few survivors, struggles to survive the onslaught of rage infected virus carriers.  The word zombie is never mentioned once during the film, but it's pretty apparent what this rage virus does to people, and the film never slows down from the time of its' opening sequence on.  28 Days Later is the scariest zombie film to come along since the original Dawn of the Dead, and with it's share of twists and turns, is always full of surprises, and this is clearly Boyle's best directorial effort since Trainspotting.  Anyone who calls this film boring obviously considers Scream a classic, and older horror fans who were raised on horror films like Romero's Dead trilogy and Halloween will find plenty to admire with this modern day classic.  The DVD extras here are great as well, including the commentary by Boyle and writer Alex Garland, plus 3 alternate endings.</p></body></html>

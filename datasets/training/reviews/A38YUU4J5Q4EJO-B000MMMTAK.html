<meta name="summary" content="Sooooo Funny!!!"></head><body><p>I LOVED Borat, and until I bought the DVD, I have never heard of his character.It is supposed to be Borat leaves his country (which I can't even pronounce!) to come to America and do a documentary, as the camera follows all his shenanigans :) .<br /><br />I just died laughing at so many parts. One that particularly cracked me up was when he tongue kisses a blonde woman, then says "This is my seester!"<br /><br />I also liked where Borat washed his clothes out in the park, in a pond.<br /><br />and where the bellhop was escorting Borat to his hotel room and he thought the elevator was it.I was ROLLING laughing. And where he kidnapped Pamela Anderson was TOO funny!<br /><br />I guess some of it was a little twisted, but so what? If you want a good laugh, pop Borat in.He is funny, and will make you laugh, gross you out (especially when he's naked)and feel sorry for him all at the same time!</p></body></html>

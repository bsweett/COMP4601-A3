<meta name="summary" content="#3 was my first Spiderman"></head><body><p>My arachnophobic husband never wanted to go, so I went with a friend. I'm renting #1 and #2 and I'll probably find out just what I missed.  I know superhero films are going to be full of CGI, but so many morphing and melting characters villains got tiresome.  The jazz club scene was cute, but just that--I could have seen it as an extra on the DVD and been amused, but for the most part it detracted from the main storyline at a critical point.<br /><br />This was a fun film to see larger than life on the screen, but I'm not sure Spiderman 3 would translate well to anything but a very high-end home theatre system.</p></body></html>

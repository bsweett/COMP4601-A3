<meta name="summary" content="even the CGIs couldnt save this disaster"></head><body><p>but it did have moments of ok'ness(the multiple tornados in L.A.the flooding of NYC)other than those moments,its a big hackathon.theres really no word sufficient to describe just how bad the acting was.i was actaually rooting for Mother Nature.for those looking for good CGI themed disaster flicks,Dantes Peak and Twister(the acting here is almost as bad as day after thanks to the pitiful jaime gurtz)might fit the bill.for those who dont ask much of there cinematic experiences,or if you find anything on MTV cutting edge then youll love this.btw,jake,you let me down here bud!</p></body></html>

This is one sick in your face horror film and has proven that Rob Zombie could be the new horror director of the coming decades. I never saw House of 1000 Corpses, but I plan on renting it tonight since The Devil's Rejects is a semi-sequel. Besides the gore goodies that are missing in all the PG-13 horror films today, this film boasts some very good acting (especially William Forsythe as the sheriff and The Firefly family (Captain Spaulding, Otis, and Baby) who are so good you will forget these aren't actually psychos in reality) and the music is extremely well placed. It was also quite nice to see Sheri Moon Zombie's bum a number of times. I must also warn people not to leave when "Free Bird" plays at the end. About ten people walked out of the theater thinking it was the outro, but almost the entire song (8-10 minutes) plays before the film is over. I think it is a great sequence and those people who left early missed out (not to mention it wraps up the movie in a more definitive way!). If you can stomach extreme language, sexual content, gore, torture, and one freaky clown, The Devil's Rejects is one of the weirdest yet most satisfying horror films to come out in a very long time. Great job ROB!</p></body></html>

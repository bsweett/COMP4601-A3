The mission and crucifixion of Jesus provide the context for a fictional narrative ending with a miracle that comes none too soon. This nearly four-hour marathon has long overture and intermission music but (God is merciful) no exit music. Warners' deluxe reissue on four discs includes the original silent movie and a disc of extra features.<br /><br />While the familiar passion of Christ unfolds as the characters encounter it, but not as Mel Gibson reinterpreted it, General Wallace tells of two childhood friends, a Jewish prince (Charlton Heston) and a Roman tribune (Stephen Boyd), who as adults clash over allegiances. The Jew is betrayed by the Roman and sent into slavery, where during a sea battle he rescues a Roman consul (the wonderful Jack Hawkins) who adopts him. He returns to Judea a rich charioteer to challenge his nemesis, who is killed in the ensuing race. He has a couple of encounters with Jesus and a former slave girl he loves, and he accepts Christ when after His death a miracle cures his mother and sister, who have become lepers.<br /><br />There are some marvelous performances in this movie, starting with those by Hawkins and Boyd as the ambitious Roman who really loves his Jewish chum (he was secretly told to play it that way). Hugh Griffith steals his every scene (and won a supporting actor Oscar) as a conniving trader with four Arabian horses to whom Heston whispers. To give the film stature, William Wyler was hired to direct; but he didn't direct its most famous sequence, the exciting chariot race, a triumph of editing and cinematography. And there's a thundering Miklos Rozsa score to match the movie.<br /><br />"Ben-Hur" by today's standards ("Troy," "Alexander," Ridley Scott's "Gladiator" and "Kingdom of Heaven") is a solemn and ponderous epic shot mostly on backlots and soundstages where even outdoor voices and noises echo. The costumes look like new clothes worn for the first time. Some of the acting is overcooked (Heston) or underdone (Haya Haraeet, his love interest.) Yes, the acerbic (and uncredited) Gore Vidal did indeed try to doctor the reverential script. "Ben-Hur" was state of the art in 1959 so we should show some Christian charity and try to stay awake. It did take home a record eleven Academy Awards.</p></body></html>

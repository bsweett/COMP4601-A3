In the film, there is a bunch of awesome characters, an insane plot, and load of profanity words should be considered as poetry. Jeff Bridges develops his character as The Dude so perfectly attuned to Sam Spade, Jake Gittes, and Philip Marlowe but in a little bit crass way. What's interesting about The Dude is that he doesn't possess much of lifelong interests except for a few things: weed, bowling, and White Russian. It is definitely one of the most well made films noir. I know the picture is so out of the element, considering the amount of profanity, drug use, sex, and hysterical subplots, but remember this: The Big Lebowski stayed true to boundaries of film noir because there is a mystery, a missing girl, a supposedly femme fatale, a regular guy who happened to become a sleuth by a freak luck, and some tragic moments in sort of a funny way. Who steals the movie besides The Dude? Of course, it is John Goodman as Walter Schobak. He was just so funny. The wild accusations The Dude made (again, Jake Gittes), I admit he made a perfect sense, however how silly it sounds, out of a baffling mystery. All in all, The Big Lebowski is very well-done.<br /><br />10/10: The Big Lebowski, as great as it is, doesn't really hold up well against test of time. It's just that I am turned off by the momentum killer of the bowling dream scenes. They don't seem to add much to the film. At the same time, I found John Goodman's character to be bit of an annoyance. Still, it is a very funny picture that certainly had its moments here and there. The acting by the cast was equally very good, and they really made the movie themselves. I loved some of the spoofs of the film noir elements in The Big Lebowski The Big Lebowski, and they add more punch to the overall comedy. What I liked the most about the plot of the film is that how stupid the Dude is and how effortless he is in solving the mystery of the tale. It is like he goes from one footprint to another by random accidents. All in all, The Big Lebowski is worth watching for any fan of film noir genre.</p></body></html>

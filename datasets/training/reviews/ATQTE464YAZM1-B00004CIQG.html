<meta name="summary" content="One of the best political satires ever made - still so"></head><body><p>"Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" (wow what a title eh?) still packs a big wallop today, in both its humor and its overall satire. Maybe it doesn't have the same affect on us today now that Russia has fallen and our enemies aren't major powers with high nuclear capabilities, but that doesn't mean it still doesn't stand as a testament of how people felt about something...and more importantly, how they could laugh at it.<br /><br />And there is a lot to laugh at in this movie, whether its just fun or it means something. There's General Turgeson reading off ten to twenty million American deaths in a Russian retaliation and calling it "getting our hair muffed." There's the classic scene of Slim Pickens' riding the nuclear bomb down like he was at a rodeo. And of course, who can forget Dr. Strangelove getting out of his chair and declaring, "MEIN FUHRER! I CAN WALK!" I can always depend on this movie for a good laugh.<br /><br />I have to also say I was really, really impressed with this DVD. There was a great documentary that tells you all you would want to know about the movie and it's creation, there are recorded interviews with Peter Sellers and George C. Scott, trailers, and original images and posters in the image gallery.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very good buy. A classic movie, and a worthy DVD.</p></body></html>

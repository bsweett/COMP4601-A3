<meta name="summary" content="The only worthwhile aspect of the movie is watching Charlize Theron - the rest is idiotic"></head><body><p>Yet another stupid stupid movie.  Sure Charlize Theron is always nice to look at on the screen, but I think it would be better to just watch her walk around talking with her real life friends than have to put up with such a silly addlebrained plot.  The science it espouses makes no sense, the fighting makes no sense (why wear bright white clothes to an attack at night?), the love relationship makes little sense, and the destruction of the technology that Aeon alone has decided must end is stupid beyond belief.<br /><br />And, by the way, a world of only five million people could not live in the luxury and with the technology this city-state (I guess a kind of advanced Singapore) generates.  Frankly, they would be scrabbling about for food and such.  Where are the food producers?  Where are the carpenters, plumbers, programmers, die makers, assemblers, cooks, gardeners, and so forth?  Calling this a parable doesn't get stupidity off the hook.<br /><br />Can we also stop, puh-leeze, with the hundred and ten pound skinny women beating up entire armies of two hundred pound males?  And why is it that the hero can spray machine gun fire into the air and each bullet takes down a bad guy, but trained and armored soldiers who happen to be bad guys can lay down focused and directed fire and produce only survivable wounds in the heroes?  That alone would make bad guys not want to go into battle, right?<br /><br />We could go on and on and on about what is wrong with this movie, but unless you are willing to see it just to look at Charlize Theron in black hair, don't bother.</p></body></html>

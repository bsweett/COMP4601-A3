<meta name="summary" content="Never know what to expect from Bill Murray anymore"></head><body><p>I loved most of his early movies. I watched Lost In Translation, which made me cry, but lately, he's gone for what can only be described as oddball movies, when he could have probably got any script he wanted. Why? Cos he didn't want to be stereotyped. He's always the funny guy. In recent movies, he's become the older man, the loner, the guy who's really not so funny as much, but can relay so much in just an expression. That's why I loved Lost In Translation so much, I saw a much different side to Bill than I'd ever seen before.<br /><br />There was something not quite right about Broken Flowers though. It just didn't seem to gel. The director seemed to like long, lingering shots of nothing to do the film, random shots, and then lots of shots of Bill just sitting on the couch, in that godawful tracksuit. The characters were very strange, but they worked. The whole story is about a bachelor going from woman to woman, never quite settling down. He discovers he has a son he never knew about, from an old flame 20 years ago, and is persuaded to go out and find this son. He visits old girlfriends from 20 years ago, finding them married, childless, still very much in love with him, or angry. (And isn't Tilda Swinton in this film unrecognisable?) Does he ever find out who or where is son is? No. The film has a very unsatisfactory ending, but after a few days of thinking about the film, I've decided I'm still not overly thrilled about the ending, but it worked. It was left open, for viewers to make their own decisions, as there is quite a few clues left throughout the film. I still can't make up my mind who I think the mother is.<br /><br />Some of the characters are quite funny, especially the scenes with Sharon Stone and her character's daughter, Lolita (played by Alexis Dziena, a star to watch out for.) Lolita totally not getting the reference to her name, and then appearing totally naked (and full frontal - brave girl). It's a weird relationship between her & her mum, and then they involve Bill's character, I just didn't know what to expect next! I'm still not sure whether the nude scene was completely necessary or not. And does she come on to him or not?<br /><br />The ending is pretty much about searching, and connecting with people. Also discovering more about yourself. Expect to be puzzled completely by this film, but as I already mentioned, I put off writing this review for a couple of days, as I wanted to think about it some more. Expect to be crying when you see some genuine emotion in the character when he visits one particular ex girlfriend's grave. I sobbed. Oh, and by the way, don't bother with the extras, they're rubbish!</p></body></html>

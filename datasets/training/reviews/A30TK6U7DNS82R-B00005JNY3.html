<meta name="summary" content="Strange Similarities to BRIDE OF CHUCKY!"></head><body><p>It's nice that Kate Hudson isn't all skin and bones [...], and she looks properly zaftig in some scenes in which, as a nurse, she's required to carry big old John Hurt around the halls of a 30-room mansion and stagger with him as a dead weight around the rain-strewn grounds of the haunted Louisiana mansion where she works.  Kate is sort of good in the part, and afterwards we argued about whether or not she was miscast.  She just doesn't seem like to sort of idealist who gets upset that there's no one to care about the elderly people at the rest home whom, once they die, their things get thrown into the dumpster because their relatives don't care enough to come fetch the junk the deceased kept.<br /><br />Well, she's on some entirely different trip but if you could ignore her motivation, which a weak script fails to supply, or which an indifferent performance by stolid old Kate fails to supply, the movie does have some thrills and puzzles.  Actually Joy Bryant, who plays the black girlfriend, should have have the main part and Kate could have been the pleasure-seeking, hedonistic Bourbon Street dancing queen.  Even Goldie Hawn might have given her character more shadings, for to me, Caroline never really had enough hard evidence to make her take the extreme steps she did, and the whole back story about being too busy to take care of her own father and the way she let him die alone was making her feel guilty about dying men, was silly and an insult to our intelligence, but I can see why Ehren Kruger had to put it in for otherwise there would have been no story.  Or it would have seemed like a "Repulsion" sort of picture in which Kate Hudson's character was just going insane because of sexual repression and not enough dates with men.  And when the only man around is Peter Sarsgaard, a girl has to take care of herself especially if she saw him in FLIGHT PLAN.<br /><br />So why hasn't anyone complained that the movie is really nothing more than a copy cat rip off of the entire plot of BRIDE OF CHUCKY?<br /><br />Hope that isn't a spoiler, but if you've seen BRIDE OF CHUCKY you'll know every last secret of THE SKELETON KEY.</p></body></html>

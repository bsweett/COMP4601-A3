<meta name="summary" content="You Might Not Get Such a Kick Out of This"></head><body><p>This is a visually striking animated film. It is beautifully colored, beautifully drawn, and has an appealing enough schnook of a hero.<br /><br />However we hardly get to know many of the key characters, such as the members of the "Furious Five." Most of them are given only a few lines to establish their personalities. The similarity between two of the opposing characters might also create some confusion among young viewers. There's Tigress, one of the heroic Furious Five. Then there's Tai Lung, also a fierce-looking feline - who is the arch villain impressively voiced by Ian McShane. A youngster (or an adult) could initially confuse the two.<br /><br />Then where we might expect some family resemblance, there is none. The Panda's father is inexplicably - a goose. In the Director's Commentary, John Stevenson says that this anomaly is gleefully accepted by children. Well, maybe...<br /><br />However, the script seems to me to be too random in too many places. Elements needed to further the plot or to bring resolution are often plucked out of the air. I expected the heroes' fighting techniques to ultimately relate somehow to their unique backgrounds and skills. For example, I kept expecting the Panda to execute some winning maneuver culled from his background balancing hot dishes of noodles, serving noodles every day in his father's noodle shop. But that never happens. Whatever fighting techniques the Panda or any of the others employ are strictly ad hoc. They don't relate to anything the characters bring to the combat or to anything they might have learned in their kung fu training with the Master.<br /><br />This is in contrast with the scripting of another recent acclaimed action animation film, "The Incredibles." In fighting their adversaries, the ploys used by the Incredibles arise organically from who they are, from powers that were initially established for them and that they honed or remembered in the course of the action.<br /><br />So younger children might be happy with the general look and appeal of "Kung Fu Panda." But for somewhat older children who demand a more coherent storyline, more consistent characterization, and some imparted wisdoms that they can actually apply in winning their battles in life, I suggest a film such as "The Incredibles."</p></body></html>

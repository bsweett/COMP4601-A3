<meta name="summary" content="hapless heroes and movie goers"></head><body><p>My two cents:<br />A big 4-4.5 star treat for the fans of the book and a confusing, fairly bizarre, yet visually striking (not thinking of the blue ---- but that too) original film for everyone else.<br /><br />The overall look of this comic book movie is fantastic. There are brilliant moments that linger in your mind well after leaving the theater. The casting seems fine. I've not heard whatever complaints there were from the fanboys, if any. The screenplay is flawed. Though, I have no idea how it could have been better and still remained as dedicated to the source material. Couldn't things have moved along at a better pace (for non-fans too)? Well, for my part, well over an hour-maybe hour and a half- into this and it still felt like things were just starting. As for the plot, it's absurd. There are maybe one or two maybe three "good guys" but they can't make a difference, can they? And they all have problems. If you think something good or at least necessary was done at the end, you are morally lost my friend. I'm glad in our universe we don't have and do not need superheroes, especially ones like these. I hope.</p></body></html>

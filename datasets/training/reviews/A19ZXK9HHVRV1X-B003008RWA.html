And the message here is that the medical system in the United States is seriously ill, if not, indeed, on life support itself.  As usual, Moore personalizes the issue for the audience by focusing on a few specific people who have fallen victim to the bureaucratic nightmare that is the American system of managed care.  Through an accumulation of largely anecdotal evidence, he shows how working-class people are often driven to near-bankruptcy by the enormity of their medical bills or, even worse, how they often get sicker or even die either because they have no insurance at all or because the insurance companies refuse to cover the operations or medications the patients need to get better.  Moore is always at his most convincing - and his least polemical - when dealing with these individual cases.<br /><br />Having completed his "diagnosis,"  Moore next moves onto the "cure," which he sees as a universal health care program run by the government.  This, of course, is where he gets most into trouble with those on the Right and the powers-that-be (i.e. the insurance companies and corporate CEO`s) who have the most to lose from any kind of system reformation.  To prove the superiority of "socialized medicine," he takes his film crew to Canada, Britain and France to check out the medical systems there.  Not surprisingly, he encounters only the most glowing reports from doctors, patients and the average man-on-the-street concerning the quality of the medical treatment in those countries.  Finally, in his most blatant example of political theater, he rounds up several 9/11 rescue workers, all of whom have developed serious illnesses as a result of their time spent at ground zero, and takes them to Cuba to receive the medical treatment these modern American heroes have been denied in their own country.  Moore's in-your-face style may not make for the most impartial examination of the issue, but it does make for one heck of a compelling human drama.<br /><br />Moore is not a "documentarian" in the egalitarian sense we have grown accustomed to from television.  He doesn't study both sides of an issue, and he feels no compunction to provide a reasoned, carefully balanced debate that allows differing opinions to be expressed.  Instead, he is a man hellbent on a mission, an individual deeply concerned with righting the wrongs that he sees in his society.  He also just happens to be an artist with enough filmmaking skill and talent to be able to convey his passions in a clear and largely convincing way to a mass audience.  "Sicko" is a much less "playful" movie than either "Bowling for Columbine" or "Fahrenheit 9/11."  Moore doesn't indulge in as many self-aggrandizing stunts or parlor tricks as he did in those other films, and he is more willing to move off into the background to allow the people in the movie to speak for themselves.  The tradeoff for this approach is that there is also a lot less humor.<br /><br />All throughout the movie, Moore is constantly appealing to our better angels. How, he wonders, can a people as great and generous as Americans tend to be, allow their fellow citizens to go on suffering when the remedy seems so clearly in their grasp.  Whether universal health care would be just another panacea, or whether it might actually turn out to be the cure for what ails us, only time will tell.  But Moore's point is that the time has long since passed for us to do something serious and concrete to address this problem.  "Sicko" may, indeed, be "propaganda," but, if it is, it is propaganda in the service of a salutary purpose.  And, after all, Moore`s is hardly the only voice out there debating this issue, for there are powerful and well-financed forces lined up on the other side.  He may, at this point, be just one little David facing down the Philistines with their corporate lobbyists and special interest money; but Moore has faith that a citizenry, armed with righteousness and passion, can slay a whole army of insurance company Goliaths - if they just put their collective minds to it.</p></body></html>

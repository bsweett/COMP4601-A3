It held my attention despite Alba's horrible acting, a few awkward scene transitions and even bad dialogue.  There was absolutely no chemistry between Gruffudd and Alba.  Chiklis was passable but it was the CGI and Evans who saved this one for me since there was no real master plot from Dr. Doom and I didn't quite wrap my brain around what they were hoping to gather in space and how it was to benefit mankind.  Definitely a paint by numbers script that suprisingly works for these cheesy super heroes.  I'll probably check out the second movie when it's released...on DVD.  Overall, a descent popcorn flick.</p></body></html>

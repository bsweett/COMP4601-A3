I know it was highly-anticipated, (duh, it's Spiderman!) but they still could've taken their time.<br /><br />I viewed this movie about as much as I saw the first I think. It just seems like they slowed down during production and the thought process during, was much broader, albeit more violent and even darker.<br /><br />At first I didn't like this much, but I watched it the 3rd and 4th time through and I was throughly impressed. One wasn't this good and I only hope that Three will be as great (date is 4/4/08 and I'm still on my way to watch it).<br /><br />Mary Jane is his love interest again, and she's married. However, she breaks up with Harold and goes back to Peter again. They love each other and unlike one, he actually makes time for her this time.<br /><br />The action was great and the villain was a methodical genius. I liked the fight at the bank where money bags were thrown all over and Aunt Mae almost got crushed by that desk. That was entertaining.<br /><br />Cover Art: B+<br />Story: B-<br />Animation: C+<br />Characters: B<br />Dialogue: B-<br />Comedic Value: B-<br />Length: B-<br />Overall: B<br /><br />4.3 stars.<br /><br />end note: final score is still up in the air.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A WELL DONE, FUN, SCARRY FILM..."></head><body><p>People who loved the first films (yes, this is a remake) will probably hate this one. People who loved the book on which the films were based will probably hate this film.<br /><br />...And that's because this is a film for the younger audience who just wants to have some scarry-fun and who couldn't care less about the previous works made on the subject.<br /><br />This film makes many changes to the original story and makes it more spectacular. It has many spooks and horrible ghosts and all those things that work so well.<br /><br />And I am glad to say this film is very fun to watch. It does have some great scarry moments.<br /><br />The only complaint I make is the total absence of development of the George Lutz character. At the beginning, he is a great guy... but the second he enters Amityville he transforms into a demonic dark-sided figure. The screenplay is so eager to get things going that it forgets to develop the character properly.<br /><br />But this problem comes from an incompatibility: the original character in the book (as far as I can remember) does not get possessed by the evil spirit. In fact, he is just a victim of the house like the rest of the family. But the screenwriters here felt they needed to get him possessed (so he would be a materialization of the house's antagonism). and here comes the problem: how could they develop this new thing if the family only spent 28 days in the house?<br /><br />They do not. The guy transforms so quickly we do loose some empathy with the character.<br /><br />But the film has so much atmosphere and scarry moments that I do forgave its flaws. I recomend this film if you never saw the original version (which I looove).<br /><br />This film is way above the average.<br /><br />Get some poporn, some friends, turn off the lights and enjoy!!!</p></body></html>

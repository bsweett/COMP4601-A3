<meta name="summary" content="4.5; Now this was the fun half"></head><body><p>Because of a totally awful local theater, we never got the full "Grindhouse" experience with 2 films and several fake trailers. Not that it mattered since most people avoided the film anyway, proving that great ideas for film geeks don't mean a thing to Joe Casual Moviegoer. I watched the film's second half "Death Proof" done by Quentin Tarantino and found it kind of a bore with a car crash and a thrilling chase being the highlights. Now we have "Planet Terror" done by Robert Rodriguez which is probably some of the most fun you can have in a movie, theater or otherwise.<br /><br />Cherry, a former go-go dancer with dreams of being a standout comedian, meets her ex Wray who has a mysterious past. Elsewhere, husband and wife Michael and Dakota are going through some marriage problems with Dakota being unfaithful. However, they will all meet when a viral infection hits town, turning the unlucky into pus-covered crazies with a taste for humans so they all, as well as the local sheriff, a barbecue cook and a scientist, need to escape town before they become lunch.<br /><br />"Death Proof" talked a lot about things evoking the feeling of old 70's cinema but as a film it just felt empty with a bunch of characters talking, and talking (and talking) with each segment bookended by a great sequence. "Planet Terror" on the other hand feels like an exploitation film would feel like: it's campy funny, it's campy gory but vastly entertaining. Deaths are disgusting yet a level of fun is injected to not make them too overtly violent. We also have the print which has been intentionally altered to have print flaws, scratches, image which seems to pulse and even a image burning up, revealing the "missing reel" which isn't included since it was always part of the joke that it was missing.<br /><br />Whereas Grindhouse's second half had unsympathetic characters but anchored by a great Kurt Russell performance, here it's basically's Rose McGowan's show and everybody else is just appearing in it. Sympathetic, believable yet able to kick undead (or whatever they are) ***, she's the scene stealer here. But then again we have Freddy Rodriguez who's finally used more than he was in Poseidon and Lady in the Water; Michael Biehn, James Brolin and Marley Shelton also appear as well as Naveen Andrews of Lost fame and Bruce Willis. The only weak link strangely is Tarantino playing a soldier/rapist who kind of hams it up a bit.<br /><br />To be honest I always found Sin City aesthetically pleasing but kind of emotionally-inert with one-note characters besides Mickey Rourke. While I'm not sure if I can call this Rodriguez's best film, it's certainly one of his most entertaining on par with Desperado.</p></body></html>

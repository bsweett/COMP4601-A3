<meta name="summary" content="Not as bad as the critics would have you believe"></head><body><p>I have to admit Colin Farrell is not the sort of actor I would ever envisage  as Alexander the Great, despite this he does do the role credit despite what many people have said.<br />Angelina Jolie howver is brilliant as his witch Queen mother, beauiful, seductive and full of feminine wiles whilst Val Kilmer gives a great performance as the doomed father of Alexander who does not see his son's worth.<br />There are some great battle scenes, fabulous scenary, stunning costumes, and all in all the cast gel together to make it a watchable movie for the older members in your family.<br />My only complaint is that it is rather long winded in parts but other than that it is a pretty good movie.</p></body></html>

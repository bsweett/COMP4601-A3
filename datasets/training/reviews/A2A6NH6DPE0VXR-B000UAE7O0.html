<meta name="summary" content="A funny and action packed zombie flick"></head><body><p>Planet Terror is Robert Rodriguez's best movie since Shark Boy and Lava Girl....j/k I mean his best since Sin City lol. It's about a gas that's released on the world that turns people into zombies. What seperates this from other recent zombie films though is the great cast and the great action and b-movie goofiness.<br /><br />  Rose McGowan has been good in movies like Scream but she shines here more than she has in other movies. She also wasn't bad in Quinten Tarantino's Death Proof. But here she steals the show as an extremely sexy stripper that loses a leg due to a zombie attack. She soon is transformed into the toughest chick with one leg when El Wray (Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez) gives her a gun for a leg.<br /><br />  Of course you also have people like Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton, Nicky Katt and Naveen Andrews in good form. But what I also love about the movie is that it casted Michael Biehn (Terminator, Aliens) as the sheriff and Jeff Fahey (LawnmowerMan) as his cook brother. Although he's the sheriff, Biehn also wants a recipe that his brother won't give him. Anyway what I like about them being in the movie is that they haven't been in many in years. Although I hear Fahey will be in Lost season 4 which is pretty cool. Now if only they had a part for Biehn lol. What I'd also like is another Grindhouse double feature but that probably won't happen since for some reason the Planet Terror and Death Proof combination didn't do fantastic in theaters.</p></body></html>

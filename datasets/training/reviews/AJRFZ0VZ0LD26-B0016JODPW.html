This is a tragedy of gigantic proportions.  We see fantastic cast of actors (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney) assembled in this sad family saga.  Two brothers, one seemingly well off and married to a beautiful woman and the other a complete loser without career, money and divorced, agree to commit "victimless crime" by robbing their parent's jewelry store.  The idea is that the insurance would cover the loss of the jewelry that is estimated to $500,000-$600,000 value. Brothers would take care of their financial responsibilites and start their lives fresh.  At least that is the plan, until everything not only fails but spirals down with dizzing velocity.  I have not seen film this good since "All the King's Men" came out couple of years ago.  This film will shake you in more ways than one.</p></body></html>

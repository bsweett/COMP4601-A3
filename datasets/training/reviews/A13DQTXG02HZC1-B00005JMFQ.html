His works are always understated but seemed to evoke emotions that other Hollywood movies won't do.  As viewers might have guessed already, this movie is about love; love in all sorts of shapes and forms; love that transcends language, culture, & border; unspoken love, love that is to be confused with lust; puppy love; endearing love, the kind of love that would last a lifetime and beyond; love of the same sex. et cetera.  Richard Curtis attempted to cover as much love as possible in this movie but as he said in the additional features in DVD, the movie length came to a staggering 3 hours 20 minutes.  Naturally, some scenes needed to be edited to much his disappointment as some scenes were his personal favourites & which I personally think should be included in the original movie itself.  Anyway, this is a very subjective view.  There were talks about how the soundtrack came about in the movie and the complexity of matching them with the length of the scenes which almost never worked out as planned.  I needn't say more.  Should you enjoy his previous writings such as Notting Hill, Four Weddings & A Funeral, you would love this movie actually!  All actors and actresses in this movie are brilliant.  Highly recommended.  It encompasses what's truly essential and what's sorely lacking in this world today, LOVE in a very big way.  As John Lennon & Yoko Ono sang, all we need is love.  DVD is definitely a better way to go to appreciate this movie in its full glory.</p></body></html>

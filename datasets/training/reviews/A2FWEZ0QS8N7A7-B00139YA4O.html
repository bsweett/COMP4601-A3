Removed from that "what happens next" compulsion, the first season replayed in DVD is even more rewarding.  Yes, you occasionally notice little -- and perhaps important -- things you missed the first time around (Hurley on Korean television for example), but mostly the pleasure comes from seeing just how consistently superb television this is -- the writing, the acting, and most of all the rich imagination and creativity that underpins it all.  Quite simply, this is the best dramatic television has to offer -- with The Sopranos on hiatus and Buffy ended -- and in the DVD versions you get it wonderfully commercial free.</p></body></html>

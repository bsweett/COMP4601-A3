Holla, my peepenheimers - I finally gave into my curiousity and watched the new "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" directed by the highly overrated Tim Burton and the almost equally overrated Johnny Depp.  PUH-LEASE!!<br /><br />Look, I will not disguise my absolute unabashedly love for the original classic masterpiece <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009FGWLW">Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>. Gene Wilder is pure genious as Mr. Wonka, in a performance that simply cannot be repeated, bettered, or even equalled.  Depp was foolishly ill-prepared to try.  Whereas Wilder invested a truly menacing, disturbing side to Wonka, Depp makes him simply 'kinda weird'.  Thumbs (and gobstoppers) down to him.<br /><br />Much is always celebrated about Tim Burton's visual and overall atmosphere created in his movies.  Yeah, he is a capable visual stylist.  But it matters very little when he doesn't do anything else right!  I'm not saying he never has (I loved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6302477751">Frankenweenie</a>). But more often enough he just comes across like a dork.<br /><br />I liked Deep Roy as the Oompa-Loompa's (and he was also the film's narrator).  But I thought the new Charlie was too goody-goody and he embarrassed his grandpa.  After his Grandpa was happy about being able to go to the factory, Charlie was all "Oh but I should sell the ticket to help the family" and made his Grandpa look like a big jerk.  There is a limit to how "helpful" a child should be.  Talk about a killjoy.  The actor playing the Grandpa is utterly delightful!  Best performance in the film.<br /><br />I didn't like the kids as much as in the original. I don't mean the young actors themselves, heavens no. I think Burton gave them one direction, something along the lines of: "Oh, you've all seen the original movie, right? Cool, just act like that."  I don't blame them.  Some of them talented, especially Anna Sofia Robb who shined in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009NZ2KG">Because of Winn-Dixie</a>.  But I don't know why they used a digital fake for Agustus Gloop instead of a real boy!</p></body></html>

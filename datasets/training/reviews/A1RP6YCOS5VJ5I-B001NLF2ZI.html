<meta name="summary" content="Kidman and Penn Carry The Movie Well"></head><body><p>The Interpreter, I thought, was a very interesting story about assasination plots within the U.N. and whehter or not people can believe the threat as true. Nicole Kidman gave a great performance as the lead character in this movie. It's not flat acting seen, but just the personality of the character who is very stressed out at this point of the movie. Sean Penn also did a great job as the agent trying to figure out the truth. It being filmed in the U.N. makes this film really unique and realistic, especially with the protestors outside that add an extra touch to this film. Overall, this movie is worth seeing. It may not be the greatest movie created, but it is still a very interesting one if you like good drama and stories about the government.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good, but could have been great"></head><body><p>Is it a coincidence that a movie based on Christian - Muslim relations was to come out after the 9-11 terrorist attacks?  Maybe, maybe not. The movie itself is quite good in many aspects, but could have been a lot better.<br /><br />First, the acting.  Coming out in the summer of 2005, this movie probably had more big name stars in it that most of the summer crop.  Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson, David Thewlis, Edward Norton, and Orlando Bloom lead of an international cast highlighted by many actors famous for both stage and screen performances of medieval roles.  The lead role went to Orlando Bloom and this movie was advertised as his breakout role.  Unfortunately, his acting, or lack thereof, is totally overshadowed by the other actors and actresses.  There are many moments where he is silent and it seems nary a thought is going thru the character's mind.  Luckily, all the other roles were played well, especially the parts of Saladin and King Baldwin.  Both Edward Norton and Ghassan Massoud portray well the leaders who shouldered so much weight on their backs in public, and handle internal bickering in private from subordinates.<br /><br />Second is the setting.  Taking place in what is now Israel, Italy and France, the movie should have been filled with grand scenes of the terrain of these areas; such as lush forests, expansive deserts, and rocky mountains.  Instead, the only grand vistas are the occasional shots of armies marching to battle.  This movie should have a taken a cue from Jackson's LOTR in terms of cinematography.<br /><br />Third is the music.  A movie of this magnitude should have hired John Williams for a complete orchestral score with dedicated pieces for each scene and the major characters.  Instead, I cannot remember a single tune from this movie's soundtrack.<br /><br />Fourth is the action scenes.  These were truly amazing in every respect; grand, chaotic, bloody, realistic, grim with sweat and dust covering the troops on both sides.  But the drawback is the sudden sword fighting skills of Bloom's character, Balian.  In this respect, this movie copies of Pirates of the Caribbean.  In both movies, Bloom's character starts of as a blacksmith who happens to make swords, and ends up displaying very impressive combat skills.<br /><br />Fifth is the look and sound of the characters.  If you look at pictures of people from the 1950s and earlier, you will notice the prevalence of bad teeth, and bad skin due to a variety of ailments, injuries, diseases, etc...  1000 years ago the average health of humans was much worse than now, yet notice how healthy and wholesome the knights look.  Clear skin, straight teeth abound.  These are soldiers, yet none have scars on them.  Related to this is the speech.  Most of the knights are supposed to be French, yet they are played by actors from the British Isles and have distinctive British accents.  Likewise, why do so many of the Arab soldiers speak English.  The makers of this movie should have taken a hint from Mel Gibson and had all the Christians speak Latin.  That would have made everything more believable.<br /><br />All in all a good movie and worth the 2.5 hours of watching it.  But it was not the best movie of 2005.</p></body></html>

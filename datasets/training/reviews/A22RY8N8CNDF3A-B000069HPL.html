The sharp plot revolves around Ron Livingston as Peter Gibbons.  His waking life is spent on a mind-numbing job in an office cubicle, reporting to eight bosses.  He has two geeky friends that hope to raise in ranks at Initech, the company they all work for.  Initech wants to downsize and increase profits by sending some jobs overseas, and eliminate others.<br /><br />Peter has a girlfriend that insists he go to therapy before they marry.  He agrees and is hypnotized at a group therapy session.  The overweight therapist that hypnotized Peter collapses and dies before he can take Peter out of the relaxing trance that makes him worry free.  He is now open to do what he wants, not what he feels he has to do to fit in his bland reality.  He was supposed to work overtime Saturday and Sunday, but sleeps through 17 messages from his boss and girlfriend.<br /><br />Peter goes back to work on Monday, not caring if he has a job or not.  He decides to just leave, and no longer have to deal with his boss, (Gary Cole).  However, Peter is reminded that his appointment with efficiency experts is now and he should go.  Because he could care less if he has his job; his leisurely new attitude and total honesty about his work habits, the efficiency experts are impressed.  Gibbons laughs that there is nothing to motivate him.  The efficiency experts are impressed and ecstatic that they found a "button" to motivate a talented employee.  He is promoted to supervise four people.  On leaving, Peter sees that the efficiency experts plan to lay off his two close friends.  The friends, along with Peter,  hatch a crazy plot to get back at the company.<br /><br />The movie also follows the pathetic life of the office worker "Milton" and his red "Streamline" stapler.  Milton moves from space to lower class space until his office is in the basement storeroom.  Milton is key to the ending, as well as many laughs.<br /><br />The plot continues to develop, including Gibbons  interest in a waitress (Jennifer Anniston) at the restaurant he takes coffee breaks at.  There is also a scheme between Gibbons and his two friends on how to make money without working.  The movie has some slow spots, but the laughs and parody of the realities of corporate culture make up a stunningly hilarious and relevant film.</p></body></html>

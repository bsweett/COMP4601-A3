If you enjoyed the version with Charlton Heston you will probably like this version with Will Smith. One thing I have to agree with several reviews here is they should have used real humans for those infected as they did in the first movie. The CGI versions are a bit over the top and don't feel real. CGI is fine as long as it is mainly used for mattes and large creatures, but when you try to make humans with it, it seems almost like watching a cartoon. Only some "Resident Evil" computer gamers may think they are acceptable. It isn't that I don't like CGI, I thought "Beowulf" was quite well done. It just didn't work here. Sometimes makeup is far more effective. Personally I would have loved to seen the infected people and animals more realistic, in other words people and dogs with makeup, not CGI. The story premise is somewhat like the book, a virus wipes out mankind. Neville and a few other humans have survived.<br /><br />Neville believes everyone has now changed to the cannibalistic creatures that come out at night. His family is dead but he has a dog as a companion. An interesting twist to how those changed, don't want changed and they are clever enough to even trap Neville. He keeps telling them he can fix this when in fact they don't desire it like he does. His dog is his best friend and probably the last thing that keeps him from going crazy with loneliness. His dog will sacrifice itself to save him inevitably. Neville will sacrifice himself for what is left of mankind as well when the time comes. Most of us would die for someone we love, so keeping that in mind it is a little easier to take the trajedy when it comes. Until then he and his dog hold up at night in his fortress like apartment and come out to scout the city for food, DVDs, and the location of infected colonies during the day. Chasing deer in a Shelby Mustang is one of the few thrills left to him. He must be home by dusk and make sure the Zombies don't follow him if he hopes to survive.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie and Bob Marley music and I think it has good replayability. Good quality DVD with animated shorts on the basic single disc, and commentarty, interviews, and much more on the two disc version. - C. Luster</p></body></html>

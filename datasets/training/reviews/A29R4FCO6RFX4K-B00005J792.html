<meta name="summary" content="Shyamalan's Second Shocker!"></head><body><p>M. Night Shyamalan's follow-up to the superb The Sixth Sense is an equally excellent film, with masterful storytelling, great acting and strong direction from Shyamalan. The storyline is about a seemingly-normal guy David Dunn (Bruce Willis), who finds out that he is impervious to pain and stronger than Schwarzenegger, when he discovers he is the only survivor from a horrific train crash. David meets up with comic book guru Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who befriends him and tells him what he can accomplish with his extraordinary gift.<p>While not as well-played as The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan has again created a world with fascinating characters and bizzare events. And like Sixth Sense, the film does throw up a shocking twist at the end which is even more unpredictable. Utilising the same techniques, the audience is treeted to the director's compelling world, much alike to the early Spielberg films; extraordinary events happening to normal people. The top-notch acting from Willis and Jackson makes the film's ideas work even better. And the premise provides a series of weird events, building up to a thrilling finale. If it has a flaw, the pace drags sometimes, but the material is handled with aplomb. This is one of the hottest new directors around working his magic to superb effect.<p>The extras are really good, with comprehensive &quot;making of&quot; documentaries, some deleted scenes which add little to the film but still make for an intersting watch, and the &quot;train sequence&quot; with a natty multi-angle feature that allows yout to watch the film fron different view points. Plus trailers, a booklet and more production info. Impressive stuff.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stock Political Film Fare"></head><body><p>The opening scene of "The Sentinel", which shows the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, gives this movie a feeling of gravitas and importance.  Sadly, the direction and overall general production value of the experience fails to live up to that opening scene and instead produces little more than stock fare for this genre.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "The Sentinel" focuses on the Secret Service for the U.S. President (David Rasche).  When the head of the President's protection detail (Michael Douglas) is accused is being a mole, lead investigator Dave Breckenridge (Kiefer Sutherland) and his rookie partner (Eva Longoria) are called in to investigate.<br /><br />The simple reason this film was made was as a vehicle for the rising stars of Sutherland (who pretty much plays Jack Bauer of 24 in this film) and Longeria (sex symbol from Desperate Housewives trying to branch into more serious fare).  Douglas is thrown in for his personal background in political flicks.<br /><br />Thus, while there is most definitely enough ensemble acting talent to carry the movie, the story doesn't come anywhere near to supporting them.  The plot of "The Sentinel" is one that has been recycled time after time and adds nothing new into the mix.  The build-up is decent, but the execution leaves one wondering "is that it...really?".<br /><br />One bright spot, as usual, is the acting performance from Kiefer.  This genre suits him perfectly, and he could have been utilized even further (perhaps an interrogation scene?!).  Unfortunately, Douglas is only decent and Longoria isn't given much to do.  Perhaps, however, there just wasn't enough "meat" in the script to do anything with.<br /><br />Overall, then, "The Sentinel" is a stock political thriller and absolutely nothing more.  If you haven't seen many of these movies, this one will appeal to you.  If you are a veteran of the genre, though, please move along.</p></body></html>

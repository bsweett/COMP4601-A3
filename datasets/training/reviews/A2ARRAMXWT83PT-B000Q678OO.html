<meta name="summary" content="One of Kubrick's masterpieces!"></head><body><p>One of the finest examples of filmmaking ever made in cinema history, this is one of my all time favorites. You all know the story, so we don't have to go there. Also, for the many detractors of this film - most of them Christians - here is a bit of advice: watch the film again and analyze it afterwards. There are many Christian themes in this film, and though they are not as optimistic as you would probably hope, they are still there. As a Christian, it's just easy for me to find God in just about anything...even Kubrick films! Yay!<br /><br />Also, this film features some of the best cinematography, writing, and acting that you will ever see/hear. Malcom McDowell is excellent as Alex, and just radiates pure evil. It's a shame that Kubrick never contacted him again after this film. They seemed to make a great team. Anyways, the whole cast is great, the music is great - in short, it's amazing. There are some things here that will disturb you, namely the lengthy rape sequence - but hey, you're supposed to be repulsed by it. If not, then I think you may have a few problems.<br /><br />If you have not seen it yet, SEE IT.</p></body></html>

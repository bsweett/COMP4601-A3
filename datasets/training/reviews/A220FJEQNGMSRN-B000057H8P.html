There are minor flaws - Cyd Charisse is unflatteringly shot for much of the picture and is nobody's idea of a prima ballerina, Oscar Levant is clearly well lubricated and sadly well past his prime, while there are quite a few technical fluffs, be it the shadow of the camera making yet another appearance or the stagehand strolling casually across the background in the Louisiana Hayride number, and the Girl Hunt ballet finale goes on far too long as per many post-American in Paris MGM musicals - but Comden and Green's script is so sharp and the numbers so good that none of that really matters. Great fun, and glorious Technicolor too - and the extras package on the two-disc set is particularly impressive: a deleted musical number Two Faced Woman and unused dailies, documentaries about the making of the film and Vincente Minnelli (with daughter Liza and Michael Feinstein providing an audio commentary on the feature), a musical short Jack Buchanan with the Glee Quartet, and a slew of Astaire trailers.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A  compelling historical  drama"></head><body><p>This review is dedicated to the nation-state, and all those who fight to retain the nation-state!<br />Braveheart is reminder- especially to the leftists and Marxists of this world, who try to wish away nationalism and the nation state- that nationalism is a powerful force that will never die, and has a depth and strength of endurance that no modern political ideology can ever have.<br />The movie opens with little William Wallace (James Robinson) begging his father to go with him, and his elder brother, on a dangerous expedition: "I want to go!"<br />Reminiscent of King David of Israel, when he was a young shepherd boy, going against the will of his father and brothers, to join in the battle against the Philistines.<br /><br />When he sneaks along behind them, seeing hundreds of Scots hanging in a hut imprints his mind forever. And the murder of his father, by the English plants the seeds of hatred for the English and their tyrannical King Edward De Long Shanks (Patrick McGoohan).<br />His attempt, when he grows up, to live the life of a peaceful farmer, quietly raising crops and a family, is shattered when the English soldiers murder his new bride, the lovely Murron McClannough, she resisted their attempts to rape her. The English have now gained a bitter enemy, who will lead the Scots to a war for freedom, culminating in the expulsion of English forces from Scotland, under Robert the Bruce (Angus McFayden), giving the Scots Freedom in their own land, but this was not before William Wallace, was captured near Glasgow, and taken to the tower of London,  where he was tortured to death.<br /><br />Mel Gibson plays the Scots hero, with panache, and real charisma, mediaeval Scotland and England are recreated magnificently, and the passions leap off the screen.<br /><br />A talented cast of powerful characters brings all the senses to life, and leads one to ponder the lessons of freedom, and of living, and dying for one's nation and people.<br /><br />The minor roles where also beautifully done.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ride the Umbrella Train to Resident Evil."></head><body><p>Rated "R". Running time: 1 hour, 40 mins. Shown in widescreen.<br /> Everyone enjoys the "Resident Evil" video game series.  personally, I play on a Playstation One (PS One).  I have just finished all five different variations of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000I1BY">Resident Evil: Director's Cut</a> (Dual Shock), so now I am ready to see this movie I have been anxious to see.<br /> First of all, this plot does not resemble the same story as the first video game, but I did enjoy this movie.  It is based on the same principal.  The train is from the "Resident Evil 2" video game.  The nice surprise for all you "James Bond 007" fans is Colin Salmon is in this film as well as he was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304916558">Tomorrow Never Dies</a> (1997), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIBURQ">The World Is Not Enough</a> (1999) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AQO3TW">Die Another Day (James Bond) [Blu-ray</a>] (2002).<br />  Everyone in the offices and laboratory of the Umbrella Corporation is gassed with a biohazard substance. Those that tried to escape in the elevator are killed.<br />  Alice (Milla Jovovich wakes up naked in the shower. The room looks like a suite. She has no memory of how she got there. She is still under the side effects of the nerve gas. A red dress is laid out for her on the bed. She walks around the mansion. Another man, Matt (Eric Mabius) is there in the same situation. Suddenly, soldiers bust into the place. They take them downstairs. They see the Umbrella rooms and the underground Umbrella Train.<br /> The soldiers are James Shade (Colin Salmon), J.D. (Pasquale Alcardi), Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), Kaplan (Martin Crewes) and Spence (James Purefoy).<br />  Alice was a soldier too, but her memory is only coming back in bits and pieces.<br />  Their mission is to get to the Hive which is deep under Raccoon City. The Hive is a top-secret research facility, but getting through it will not be easy. You have biohazard zombies and other horrifying surprises.<br /><br />  The cast also includes: Heike Makatsch and Jaymes Butler, Jason Isaacs.<br /><br />  Screen Gems (remember them from television in the 1970's?) presented this film which is now part of the Sony Pictures Entertainment company.<br />  The audio commentary is really cool to turn on the second time you watch this film.  The video game is discussed.<br />  Filmed in Berlin, Germany and Toronto, Canada, plays like a film the SCI-FI (now Syfy) cable network would broadcast.<br /><br /> The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002J4X1Q">Resident Evil (Deluxe Edition)</a> contains:<br /><br /> Option of language and subtitles: English , Spanish, French, Portuguese.<br /><br /> Audio Commentary #1: Director Paul W.S.

My feelings for Cruise aside, I did enjoy this film though it does bare (story structure-wise) a gross simiarlity to Dances with Wolves.  In fact, had the whole story been about Watanabe's character this could have been a better movie--that and we avoid the whole Brave Heart/ The Patriot ending.  Overall, you we be entertained.</p></body></html>

Everything about this film is wonderful.  The set, the drama, the acting, the music, and the cinamatography all whisk you away to another era.  The film has everything a moviegoer wants.  It has action, mystery, drama, romance, and at times it is even funny.  Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman were the only ones I think that could play these roles right.  They were a match made in heaven.  They are probably a better on screen couple than Vivian Leigh and Clark gable.  This is a timeless piece of film that everybody should see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Winner of "MAC and Me" Award for Product Placement"></head><body><p>I have mixed feelings about this movie.  First and foremost, the concept is sound. The idea that any potential cloned beings have human rights-life, liberty, property, self-determination, etc.-is a dark horse hot topic. We need to settle this issue right now before Brigitte Boisselier and the Raelians hold another press conference.<br /><br />The main problem with this film is the execution.  It looks too much like "THX-1138" with hair, and feels too much like "Logan's Run" on bullet bikes.  It seemed like I was watching a rerun, even to the point of seeing the commercials.<br /><br />This brings me to my second point: product placement. This film wins this year's "MAC and Me" award for the most obvious, annoying, distracting, and ham-handed product placement.<br /><br />Product placement is distracting because it is so obvious.  It does not fit in the flow and theme of the movies, and it destroys the Hollywood Magic and Illusion.  It is a crass commercial sell out, and it insults the viewers.  We are seeing a film about human rights, and they want to make a buck off of Puma Tennis Shoes.<br /><br />The worst offence is the scene with Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream.  It has no logical connection with the first hour and a half of the previous movie.  Lincoln and Jordan are on the run form the compound and the government assassin, hunkering down in Tom's house, and then we jump to Jordan giving out free Ben and Jerry's Subversive Ice Cream to Children. I felt like I was watching a Mormon "Family Night" Advertisement in the middle of a high-tension film.  Blech!<br /><br />Yes, it alerts the government assassin to their location, so it furthers the plot. But couldn't it have been done another way, and without the obvious advertising.<br /><br />Another distraction was the gag with the costumes in McCord's closet.  Yeah, we get the humor about what people do behind closed doors, and in the privacy of their own home. However, it was not humor, which involves moral irony, but a mindless gag. Once again people, we are watching a movie about human rights, not Beavis and I-don't-know-what-Head.<br /><br />The "ahem" scene was another area that could be improved.  As it was presented, it was just another form of product placement.<br /><br />This movie is salvageable, however.  It is a sound concept, but with a flawed execution.  I suggest the writers and director have a six hour "Twilight Zone" marathon, with four episodes of "Night Gallery" thrown in for variety.  If they rethink their execution, they could re-release this film in another form, and recoup their losses.</p></body></html>

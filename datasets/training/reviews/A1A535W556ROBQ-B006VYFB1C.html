<meta name="summary" content="Still hunting the last game"></head><body><p>I think you have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this slow-paced adaptation of Michael Lewis' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393338398">book</a>.  I thought Brad Pitt was very good as Billy Beane, and Jonah Hill excellent as Peter Brand, who used Bill James' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0879464739">methods</a> to evaluate ballplayers and help Beane rebuild a team on a relatively shoe-string budget at Oakland.  The film offers flashbacks to Beane's playing time, a kid with great potential but had failed to measure up to the big leagues.  This seemed to influence Beane's decision to play the percentages rather than become overly enamored with a ball player's swing or the crack of the bat.  Beaneball, as it would come to be called, worked predominantly with on-base percentages, driving scouts and manager Art Howe up the wall.  There are a lot of nice personal touches in the film, such as Beane's relationship to his 12-year-old daughter and his attempts to reach out to his players when the A's were in a big slump.  The film captures the emotional high of the A's improbably 20-game run, and the low of their playoff defeat to the Twins.  For Beane, it was all about winning the last game.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Just plain silly"></head><body><p>The only good thing about this film is Julianne Moore who always, always, gives everything she's got to any film in which she appears. She does a creditable follow-up as the alienated Clarice Starling in what is otherwise a deeply stupid film.<p>The screenplay gives only the merest nod to Thomas Harris's signal achievement in actually humanizing Hannibal in the book; in the film, Hopkins gives the same ridiculous, over-the-top performance he offered in Silence of the Lambs. Why he possesses an Academy Award for it will be forever beyond my comprehending. (If you want to see a truly alarming, deeply inhabited Hannibal, check out Manhunter--Michael Mann's ill-advisedly renamed Red Dragon--and see British actor Brian Cox do in only a few minutes what Hopkins cannot do in two full-length films: impart the true horror of evil personified, without bells and whistle but just sheer acting ability.)<p>For all the moody, European effect, this movie just doesn't happen. It comes alive when Moore is the focus. When it's Hopkins, it's all just gore, more gore and still more gore--pointlessly. Unlike the book, where the reasons are clear, in the film Hannibal is just a killing machine. Liotta also gives an over-the-top performance that lacks any hint of subtlety. The audience doesn't even get to enjoy the final scene as written by Harris; it's turned into an additional bit of meritless gore.<p>Don't bother with this one. Get Manhunter instead--which is truly the best film of a Harris book.</p></body></html>

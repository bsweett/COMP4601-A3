Then why are so many people interested in a vacuous, untalented void, with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever, named Paris Hilton?  Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh on Ms. Hilton, but I do so tire of constantly seeing her visage plastered over every stinking media outlet as if she's someone truly worthy of the attention...based on a DC/Vertigo comic book (or graphic novel, if you prefer) called Hellblazer, Constantine (2005) was adapted for the screen by Kevin Brodbin (The Glimmer Man) and directed by Francis Lawrence, whose previous credits are limited to a TV series called `Making the Video', a show that focuses on the actual making of music videos, which, to me, is about one step below those who actually direct music videos, but hey, we all have to start some place...starring in the movie is Keanu `Mr. Woodenhead' Reeves (The Devil's Advocate, The Matrix), along with the very attractive and talented Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, Beautiful Creatures).  Also appearing is Tilda Swinton (Vanilla Sky), whom often gets confused with actress Cate Blanchett, former lead singer from the band Bush Gavin Rossdale, crazy eyeball man Pruitt Taylor Vince (Monster), Max Baker (The Island), Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator), Shia LaBeouf (I, Robot), and Peter Stormare (Fargo, The Big Lebowski) as the embodiment of all that is evil, that's right, I'm talking about Satan...can you dig it?<br /><br />Keanu plays John Constantine, a chain smoking demon hunter, stuck between Heaven and Hell.  Apparently God and the Devil are engaged in a wager, with the souls of all mankind at stake, and since angels and demons can't cross onto our plane of reality, both sides use what's called half breeds to peddle influence, hoping to draw individuals one way or another.  When these half-breeds, specifically the ones from Hell (as you can figure, they're notorious cheaters), break the rules, Constantine deports them back to whence they came, sort of an immigration officer of the damned.  Recently Constantine has been noticing demonic activity above and beyond what he's used to, and it appears to be tied to the suicide death of the sister of a L.A. detective Angela Dodson, played by Weisz, who believes her devoutly Catholic sister who have never risked eternal damnation by doing so, and thereby must have been murdered.  Their paths eventually cross, and Constantine's contacts begin turning up dead (as they get too close to the answer), with signs indicating a possible shift in the fragile balance between good and evil is coming, one that could mean an end to the good times here on Earth.<br /><br />I think this movie is a great example of what happens when one focuses so much on all the little details, and not enough on the casting, expecting any old high profile name to fit the bill and tie it all together...namely in Reeves.  Now I've had the opportunity to read the original story way back when it came out in the Hellblazer comic book, and while I can't recall many of the details, I certainly had a good idea with regards to the character of Constantine, and Reeves just didn't fit the bill, no matter how much they tried to jam his square peg into the round hole.  His character displayed the cynical attitudes and sarcastic, sometimes caustic nature, but it didn't feel like it actually emanated from within Reeves but rather something he was trying to channel from the script.  At least Weisz was there to pick up some of the slack, but there was just too much for her to handle...and so little attention was given to the supporting characters so they were unable to help in that aspect.  Also, I thought the script was somewhat weak, as the dialog added very little life to the characters, with perhaps the exception of Weisz and Stormare, who were both relatively interesting to watch...also, the script and direction seemed to expect a lot of difficult intuitive assumptions from the audience, which often resulted in some confusing aspects that didn't necessarily get cleared up by the end of the story (the Spear of Destiny aspect, in particular).  In terms of the direction, I thought there were some great individual sequences, but when tied together, they didn't work as well as they could have.  The real strength of the film lies in the production design, bringing the special effects to life and merging them in with the real life elements.  They certainly provided a visually interesting and entertaining backdrop to the story, it's just too bad Reeves was chosen to be the focal point of the story as he just couldn't pull it off, or at least that's my opinion, which in the grand scheme of things counts for very little.  I've watch much of the extras in the `making of' featurettes, so I have some idea of the amount of work that went into developing the look and feel of the film, so I wanted to give those folks credit as they worked extremely hard and held up their end very well.  Would a different lead actor have made the difference?  It certainly would have helped a lot, as Keanu's performance only helped to exacerbate the relative weaknesses, specifically in the script, and to a lesser degree, in the direction.  Overall the film was fun and somewhat interesting, but hardly one anyone should rush out to see, especially die-hard fans of the source material, as they'll probably be disappointed the most given such a lack luster, high profile showing of such an interesting and complicated character...is it me, or, for those who read the storyline featured in this film, so much more surprising in the comic than in the film?  I suppose since I knew how it was going to end, the shock value was limited, but it just felt like it came off so much more effective in the comic...<br /><br />I won't bother going over the boat load of extras, as the Amazon website lists them in detail adequately enough, but they did help me appreciate the film a bit more than I did after I saw it...<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />By the way, I did really like those holy brass knuckles...smiting evil was never so cool...</p></body></html>

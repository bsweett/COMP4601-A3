<meta name="summary" content="What A Shock!  This Is Really Good!"></head><body><p>I laughed when a friend suggested this movie. "Yeah, right," I answered, eyes rolled up. "Well," he finally said a few weeks later, "Here, just look at it. Take my copy and bring it back."<br /><br />"Okay, " I answered, "what do I have to lose? "<br /><br />Obviously, I was shocked. This has to be one of the all-time surprises I've ever encountered in movie-watching. Who would have thought this film was this good? Talk about "original!" This is about as original and entertaining as they come....so I have to rank this film right up there with my comedy favorites.<br /><br />I refuse to detail the story because the more you explain what it's about, the stupider is sounds and the less likely you will give it a shot. I will say Bruce Campbell does a fabulous job of imitating Elvis Presley. In fact, he is the best I have ever heard, speaking-voice-wise. Ossie Davis is also a hoot as the old black man who thinks he's President John F. Kennedy. See? I can't say more, because it gets worse, story-wise, the more you explain.<br /><br />Just trust me that if you appreciate dark humor with some horror thrown in, you'll love it. It's a bit sleazy and the language is very rough, so be ready for that. I guess you could say this "is not for all tastes." You have to be a little warped to enjoy this, but most of us are to some degree.<br /><br />Just be ready for one of the oddest films you've ever seen.  For added entertainment I've heard that Campbell's commentary on the DVD is one the best ever put on a DVD, but I have yet to check that out.</p></body></html>

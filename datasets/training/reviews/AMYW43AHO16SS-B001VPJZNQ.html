<meta name="summary" content="Too good to be true!"></head><body><p>Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment makes their foray into the motion picture business with this action-adventure.  &quot;The Rock&quot; gives a pretty good performance as a bounty hunter who is tasked to bring back a family member (Seann William Scott) from an Amazon jungle.  The stunts are almost too good to be true.  The story almost falls apart with the ridicuous dialogue.  However, the action is enough to make this a pretty reasonable movie to endure, much like bubble gum.</p></body></html>

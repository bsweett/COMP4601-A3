I started watching it and thought that "ok, this is going to be very predictable and boring". I was pleasantly suprised to find out that it had many twists and turns within the movie. What I also found interesting is that thier mother was a foster home worker that couldn't find homes for the four children, so she adopted them into a loving home. They were children of different races and orientation which isn't presented in movie format very often. I was very impressed with the way this was presented with humor and common conflicts within a family. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants an action movie with the edge of mystery.</p></body></html>

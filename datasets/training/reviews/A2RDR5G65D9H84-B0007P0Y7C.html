Elektra died in "Daredevil", but she was brought back from the dead by the Masters. The problem is that now both sides, good and evil, seek her out. She is currently working as a gun-for-hire and is asked to go to an island and wait for instructions regarding her next mission. While she is waiting, she meets a father and daughter living in isolation and trying home-schooling. As soon as Elektra starts to get close to this people, she finds out that they are her target!<br /><br />Compared to "Daredevil", I would say that "Elektra" walks more into the fantastic side, with elements of future seeing, the use of animals to see distant events and other supernatural powers. In this sense, it is more in line with other Marvel comics, like X-Men. The action scenes are not at the level  of "Daredevil" though, which is a shame, since Jennifer Garner is the perfect choice for this type of scenes.<br /><br />Elektra has flashbacks from her childhood and we also get to see some of the events that developed between the time she was brought back from the dead and the current moment. This gives us some information that is helpful for understanding this character, but the development stops there. I would say that overall the film is OK, and allows us to spend some time entertained; but that is all there is to this production. If you are a fan of Marvel, then you definitely have to see it, but for the rest of you I would say do not bother.</p></body></html>

Usually the politically correct leanings of the director are more than I care to endure. However, this one surprised me because it's good film-making, in addition to carrying a very heavy message about man's inhumanity to man. Don Cheadle does a great job as the noble hotel manager. The violence is visible, bit not gagging. I add my thumbs up to this very popular flick.</p></body></html>

THE BADDEST CAT IN THE WHOLE DAMN TOWN.BADDER THAN AH"></head><body><p>KING KONG was (with a certain fire breathing lizard)my<br />FAV. rubber toy from 74. How can anyone not love The King.<br />This and one other are the DEFINITIVE monster on a rampage<br />movie,this is a classic not only of the HORROR film but of cinema<br />itself! Rarely has there been so convincing a fantasy creation<br />on the screen as Kong. Willis O'Brien F/X give The King charming<br />sort of life and personality sadly lacking from today's special F/X<br />Corny performances and Max Steiner's great score add to the fun!<br />Long Live The King!<br />NOTE:Also recommend Gojira/Godzilla 1954</p></body></html>

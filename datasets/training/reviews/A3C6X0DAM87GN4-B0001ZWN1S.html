Coppola makes us feel as if we're part of  the&quot;FAMILY&quot;. We feel as if were behind the scenes watching the  Corleone's up's and down's. A one of a kind screenplay written by Mario  Puzo and Coppola,and as we all should know by now,the film the based on  Puzo's novel. Truly desevering of the Oscars in won. Brando's performance  in this movie,is in my opinion,the best of his career. And the same goes  with the rest of the cast:Al Pacino,Diane Keaton,James Caan,Robert  Duvall,and Talia Shire. Everyone in this movie delivers a powerhouse  performances. Many unforgettable lines and characters that will stay with  us forever. Terrific music score by Nino Rota,beautiful camerawork by  Gordon Willis,and top notch directing Coppola. Truly one of the greatest  films ever made! If there's anyone who hasn't seen this movie,you have no  idea what your missing. A must for anyone's video collection.</p></body></html>

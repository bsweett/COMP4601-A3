<meta name="summary" content="great actors don't make up for a so-so movie"></head><body><p>Seven was a bit of a disappointment to me.  While the actors are, of course, top notch (who actually dislikes Morgan Freeman?  You're a liar!) the actual storytelling in this movie left me feeling pretty bored and uninterested.<br /><br />I would have liked more in the way of atmosphere, instead of one storyline bit carefully moving along at a pace that almost put me to sleep a couple times.<br /><br />I understand most people like this movie, and that's perfectly fine with me, but it just wasn't good enough for me.  Maybe if I give the movie a second chance I'll like it more.  That's always a possibility.  Sometimes the second time finally makes something click.  Or maybe I'm just not smart enough to get it :)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Shocker"></head><body><p>"House of Sand and Fog" is a shocker of a movie. The clashes of the American and Iranian cultures are made all too real as a young woman (Jennifer Connelly) battles a former Iranian colonel (Ben Kingsley) over her repossessed house which he had bought at auction. To say that Sir Ben overacts might be too strong, but he sure does emote and he is very intense, yes, very intense. His face can be very grim and fierce at times.<br />Connelly plays a self-indulgent brat who because of addiction issues didn't keep track of the county mail that was coming to her warning her of repossession. Ben wants to flip the house and get something better. The house has a beautiful view of the sea, reminding Ben, his wife and teenage son of the beautiful view of the Caspian Sea they had before they were forced to flee Iran.<br /> A bent deputy sheriff, who is a bigot, a self-indulgent boy-man, falls for Jennifer and comes to her aid, threatening Ben with deportation even though he's an American citizen. He's the one who precipitates the tragedy.<br />This drama is told in very realistic terms; the acting is fine, and it will have an impact upon you as you view it. The story is set up almost like a Greek tragedy; there's an inevitability about the situation and the working out of the plot. Everything seems so simple, but because Ben and Jennifer are so relentless and single-minded, there is no easy way out. With emotions running so high, anything is apt to happen. The ending will leave most viewers shaken.</p></body></html>

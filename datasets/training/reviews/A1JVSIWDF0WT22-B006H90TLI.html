<meta name="summary" content="FARGO WITH NO SNOW !"></head><body><p>If you've ever seen "Fargo" you could have gone to this movie without knowing anything about who made it and realize it was a Cohen brothers film in about 2 minutes. The same crazy circumstances surrounding the main plot, the same "you have to see them to believe them" weird looking characters talking in the stragest of accents, etc.<br />Some people have liked the ending, some haven't, if only I could remmember what the heck Tommy Lee Jones was saying when the credits cut him off for good, if only I hadn't had to wonder for about 5 minutes if that was indeed the main character dead on the floor (or was it one of the mexicans ?). Leaving to your imagination what happened to the girlfriend is one thing but this ending felt so anti-climatic !<br />Still there's tons to recomend this movie and if some people liked the ending, good for them. Personally, I'm not going to pretend I did.</p></body></html>

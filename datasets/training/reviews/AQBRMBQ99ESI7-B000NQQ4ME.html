<meta name="summary" content="Interesting but Not Enjoyable"></head><body><p>This is an interesting film. It is an adventure story set in Meso-America just before the arrival of Europeans. The film does not name the culture portrayed, though I have heard some refer to it as Mayan, but it strikes me as very "Aztec" in its depiction. By that, I mean that there is plenty of gore, cruelty and human sacrifice.<br />The story is of a fairly rural village that is happy enough and getting by. One morning they awake to find that they are being raided by a war party from the "big city". Most of the adults are captured and led off into slavery in the big city. For the women, slavery means servitude. For the men, it is much less pleasant.<br />The men find themselves painted blue and taken to the top of a large pyramid where the local priests are systematically sacrificing them, cutting out their hearts to burn on an altar, lopping off the heads and sending the corpses to tumble down the steps for the amusement and nourishment of the locals. When a solar eclipse is finally over with, there is no further need of the captives.<br />The remaining men are taken out to play a game where they are promised their freedom is they successfully run a bloodthirsty gauntlet. When one of the captives manages to kill the son of a leader and make it to the woods, the chase is on. The remainder of the film involves the chase and the effort to stay alive as the hunted becomes the hunter.<br />As I opined before, this was a very interesting film but it was not very enjoyable.</p></body></html>

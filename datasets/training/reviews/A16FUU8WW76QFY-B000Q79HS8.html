I don't think moviegoers really thought of Damon as an action star before 'Identity', but that's all changed now.  With 'The Bourne Supremacy' Damon does another turn as the troubled amnesiac spy/assassin Jason Bourne, and what a trip it is the second time around!<br /><br />This film is portrayed through the Bourne character's eyes and mind.  Everything moves at a breakneck on-the-fly pace, reflecting Bourne's reflexive reactions to unanticipated circumstances.  His near automatic responses seem able to get him out of almost any disaster-but Bourne is developing a consience, and feels guilty about some of his shadowy operations.<br /><br />Damon is joined by well-cast group of character actors such as Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, and Karl Urban as a Russian assassin.  They add real meat to the high octane mix of this film.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers about the manic cutting and camera shake-it is disconcerting at times.  Apparently some directors feel it is 'artsy' to do this, but it is just an irritant in this case. Other than the camera work, this is a fine action film that owes a great deal to masters of the genre (John Frankenheimer comes to mind-this film reminded me of 'Ronin').<br /><br />I enjoyed this one even more than the first film, but have to subtract one star for the overediting and camera shake.  These do have their place in an action film, but have been a bit overdone here.  Nevertheless, this is one heck of a movie...4 stars!</p></body></html>

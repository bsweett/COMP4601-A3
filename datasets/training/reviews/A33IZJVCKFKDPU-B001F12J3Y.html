<meta name="summary" content="ALL ABOARD!!!!!!!  This Holiday Film"></head><body><p>First off, Robert Zemeckis is one of the most creative movie minds in the business.  He has always been way ahead in movie technology.  Whether it was Back To The Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, or Forrest Gump, Zemeckis has always been where the future technology is.  And the same goes for The Polar Express, which is a visual masterpiece... and an okay story.<br /><br />This children's Christmas story is about boy named Billy, who doesn't believe in Santa Claus.  So on Christmas Eve, a train named The Polar Express comes to pick him up and takes him on a journey to the North Pole. There he meets Santa Claus and believes in the Christmas spirit once again.  Thats basically the gist of the story.<br /><br />As stated earlier, the visual effects are amazing in this movie.  Zemeckis used a motion capture device, the same thing that video game creators use in sports games.  Everything from the train ride to the design of the North Pole (which is the best visual part of the movie) is purely amazing.  Also, Tom Hanks (oh yeah, he's in the movie) plays five different characters.  Everyone from Billy to the train conductor to Santa Claus himself, are Tom Hanks' facial and body movements.  The story itself is ok.  The major problem is that Zemeckis tried really hard to stretch a book that was only about 30 pages long into an hour and forty minute long movie, and some scenes are really stretched out to fill in time.<br /><br />My overall opinion is that this was a good movie, but nothing particularly special.  The only thing special are the effects.  But this is still a good holiday movie for the family and I would reccommend that you take your family or loved one to see this movie.  Maybe the Christmas spirit in you will be rejuvenated, but probably not.</p></body></html>

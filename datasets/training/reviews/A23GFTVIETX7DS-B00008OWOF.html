<meta name="summary" content="Not what I expected, but still a solid film"></head><body><p>The trailers and the graphics used to promote &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; make this movie seem like a light-hearted, cartoonish chase movie, but it's much more serious than that.  Director Spielberg delves into the psychology of a real-life con artist and impersonator, teenager Frank Abagnole Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), who runs away from a broken home and must rely on his wits, albeit illegally, to keep himself afloat.  As Frank's cons get more and more bold and skilled, the FBI agent on his tail, Hanratty (Tom Hanks), scrambles to outwit him.  The two form a unique relationship of the hunter and the chased, with Frank toying with Hanratty in scene after scene. What Frank doesn't expect is to find the love of his life and a close-knit family so unlike his own that he wants to remain in their midst.  <p>The best performances are the smaller supporting roles:  Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. and Martin Sheen as Frank Jr.'s father-in-law.  Di Caprio does a solid job with his part as a baby-faced, sweet-talking impersonator, but he rarely lets the complicated emotions surface.  Likewise, Tom Hanks is good as the agent obsessed with capturing Frank, but he doesn't add any magic to the role.  The soundtrack, with its cartoonish chase theme, helps lighten the film.<p>&quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; is a cross between &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and &quot;Matchstick Men.&quot;  Frank's scams are often comically clever, but there is a dark underside to his story.  Its the darkness that creates the bond between Frank and the audience, as it's difficult not to feel for a young man who feels unloved and powerless.  As Frank gains confidence, he blossoms - and the audience roots for his happiness, even as we know it cannot last.</p></body></html>

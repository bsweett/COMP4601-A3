Something about it will haunt you forever and make you very afraid of the world.  It spawned a million copycat books and films which couldn't hold a candle to it.  It lead Anthony Hopkins to a profitable career which lead him to star in about 25 films per year in every genre possible.  It did everything short of having the enrollment at Quantaco jump 400% and inpire a haircut called "The Jodie".  But this was a phenomenal movie.<br /><br />Jodie Foster plays Clarise, an FBI trainee who is assigned by the head of Behavioral Science to study an asylum patient by name of Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  This odd errand has an ulterior motive, as the FBI is curious to know if he knows anything about a serial killer who has been looming around the Midwest known only as Buffalo Bill.  Once a senator's daughter, Catherine Martin, is kidnapped by Buffalo Bill, Clarise and the FBI descend on Dr. Lecter as their only possible resource, anxiously seeking information.  Lecter is a monster, a completely evil, horrible monster, who loves the attention he's getting and to keep Clarise coming back he talks in riddles at all times.  "All that you need to know is right here in these pages of the case file, Clarise."  And in perhaps the best editing and split scene in the history of film, the FBI goes to the wrong house and Clarise goes to the right one to find herself face to face with Buffalo Bill.  Here she slays the dragon, rescues the damsel in distress, and conquers evil.<br /><br />There are so many layers to this movie it's hard to know where to start.  It is the most terrifying movie ever, the horror of knowing that there are people like Buffalo Bill in the world as well as Dr. Lecter.  The fact that the lead is a woman gives it a twist, as we see Clarise living in a man's world, braving the elements, but at the same time she is more vulnerable to fear and harm.  Trying so hard, brave little Clarise goes into the monster's cave to meet the most terrible creatures that even the bravest of men can't face.  I admired that about her, that she is really scared to death but she is able to pull it all from within to overcome not just her fears but to triumph over evil.<br /><br />The relationship between her and Dr. Lecter is probably what scares but fascinates us the most.  He clearly likes her, and keeps her coming back because he wants the attention and to be with her more.  Clarise knows the only way to get to Buffalo Bill is to probe Dr. Lecter, so she is forced to not just return to him but appease his evil by sharing her nightmare from childhood about the lambs being slaughtered on the farm she was sent to after her father's death.  And Dr. Lecter loves it, getting into her haunted past to see what he can use, plus feeling that they have a bond or a trust when he has none with anyone.<br /><br />Some criticism?  The only criticism I can think to point out is the Buffalo Bill history.  We all want to know how and why someone is the way they are, especially someone like him.  It was hinted upon when Dr. Lecter said that he was not born a killer but made into one through years of systematic abuse.  We wanted to know what it was, but because of time constrains and story it was avoided.  Read the book and you'll get the full picture.<br /><br />Here it is 15 years later, and I think I still wake up at night hearing that aweful screaming of the lambs ...</p></body></html>

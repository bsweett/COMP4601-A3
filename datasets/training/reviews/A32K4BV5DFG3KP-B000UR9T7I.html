<meta name="summary" content="Great action ,poor plot."></head><body><p>Spider man 3 could have been really good but sadly it was not. With the great fight sequences and fantastic cinematography,it had all of the nuts and bolts. Here are some of the flaws. The plot was so mixed up and crazy who could keep up with it? Nothing was explained ,where did the meteor come from ,I know space but,come on some kinda explanation was needed. What was the biomass made out of? Even if they had said it was made out of some kinda dark matter molecular energy it would have given some credability to the story. This film is also guilty of a major sequel no no. Changing the story line to fit the movies plot. With the sandman's charecter being incorporated into the story line back in the first film. Not to mention this movie is needlessly too long . Thirty minutes could have easily been cut off. Kirstin for the sake of Kirstin,c'mon I'd would have rather seen spidey hook up with the landlords daughter ,who at least seems like a real person. The "I'm to sexy bad boy sequence" was really corny and way too long. Overall the action was great but the jumbled mess of a plot and too many villians,who were all just misguided good people gone down the wrong path,Isn't there anyone who is just truely evil? Could have been great but sadly it is what it is.</p></body></html>

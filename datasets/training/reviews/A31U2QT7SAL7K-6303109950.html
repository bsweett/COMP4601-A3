<meta name="summary" content="The Second Best Film of the 1990's"></head><body><p>Pair this one with Clint Eastwood's &quot;Unforgiven&quot; and you have the two superlative movies of the last decade.  This remake far surpasses the original &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,&quot; with its perfect  casting of Kurt Russell, Powers Boothe, Sam Eliott, Bill Paxton, and Jason  Priestly who shows that he can exist outside of the &quot;90210&quot; zip  code.<p>But it is Val Kilmer, one of Tinseltown's most gifted  &quot;chameleons&quot; who immerses himself as the legendary Doc Holliday.  Everyone in my circle of friends lauded his performance as one of the  finest that has ever graced the silver screen.<p>The guy can act!</p></body></html>

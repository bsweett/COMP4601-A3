<meta name="summary" content="Another Masterpiece in a Long Line of Masterpiece's from Stanley Kubrick"></head><body><p>Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining is widely regarded as one of the best films of the horror genre and contains some of the most iconic images of not only horror films, but films in general. Like all of Kubrick's films, the initial reception wasn't very positive but time has been good to The Shining. Still today, it's a film that polarizes some viewers; many feel it's too cold, too slow-moving while others regard as it as another masterpiece in a long line of masterpieces from the great director. Now, with its availability on Blu-Ray, one is finally allowed to fully appreciate Kubrick's perfectionism. I saw this film for the first time on television at the age of five, tuning in quite late but finding myself glued to the screen. Fourteen years later, and having seen it many times since, I still notice new things about the film. Watching it on Blu-Ray, I can tell you that the iconic images that make up this film have never looked better.<br /><br />Everyone is familiar with the beautiful, scenic opening helicopter shot and the haunting music that accompanies it. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a former schoolteacher, arrives at the Overlook Hotel to take a job as the winter caretaker. The hotel is closed between October and May, with the 25-mile stretch of road leading to it averaging 20-feet of snow. Jack intends to stay there with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd), while taking advantage of the seclusion to work on a novel. Once they arrive to begin their stay, Danny, who has been having horrifying visions of the hotel courtesy of his imaginary friend Tony, meets the chef Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers), who possesses a telepathic gift similar to Danny's. Soon, the family is all alone at the hotel and as the snow starts covering everything in sight, Danny's visions become more horrifying and Jack begins a slow descent into madness.<br /><br />Few films produce so many iconic images. Audiences that haven't seen this film can identify many of them. Danny riding his bike through the halls of the Overlook, the image of the two dead girls, and the blood pouring from the elevators are some of the most recognizable moments in cinematic history. Then of course there's the legendary scene with Jack Nicholson that is featured on nearly every piece of promotional material for the film. For all of its disturbing and even violent imagery, there's less blood and gore than one would expect from a horror film of this stature. The strength of Kubrick's filmmaking is that many people remember The Shining as a violent film, which it really isn't. Even with a miniscule amount of violence, this film contains some of the most nightmarish images in all of cinema. Kubrick strayed drastically from King's source novel, but the masterpiece that came as a result is much more psychological, ambiguous, and terrifying. Anyone who says differently must remember that nearly every truly iconic scene in the film comes from Kubrick, not King. The flip-side of the argument could be that, arguably, the scariest, most unexplainable, and downright creepy scene, which features a man in a bear (or is it a dog?) suit came from King's novel.<br /><br />Kubrick seemed to always be working with great stories when making his films, but his emphasis was always on form and that's what makes this film stand as tall as it did 31 years ago. The red color motif, the static images of two girls, the blood slowly pouring from the elevator, the score that wonderfully accentuates and strengthens the effect of the filmmaking; these are the things people take away from the film. Kubrick was a photographer before he was a filmmaker and this film really honors his ability to frame a shot of innocent, common things and make them terrifying. The film's majestic, jaw-dropping, unexplained and perhaps unexplainable final shot has baffled viewers for years and given them plenty to analyze/discuss. It's the poetry of these shots that make The Shining possibly the most elegant horror film ever made.<br /><br />The characters are also memorable, but this is because of the actors more than the characters. Not that the characters are underwritten, but the acting is what burns them into your cinematic memory. This is true also for the Overlook Hotel, which is the silent character in the film. As a concept, the hotel is terrifying but the way it appears under Kubrick's direction makes it all the more so. The performance Danny Lloyd managed to give without knowing he was in a horror film is remarkable. It's fine work by a child actor. The late, great Scatman Crothers has such a warm, endearing screen presence that can also be stern and frightening. Duvall must play distressed in almost every scene and the stress that she suffered during the shoot shows in her performance, giving it a real sense of intensity. Philip Stone gives the most oft-overlooked (no pun intended) performance as Delbert Grady. Rarely mentioned in discussions, I invite you to consider how quietly frightening his performance is and how quickly and seamlessly he goes from cheerful normality to terrifying menace.<br /><br />Then there's the legendary Jack as Jack performance. Few actors can conjure up genuine menace in quite the same way Jack Nicholson can, especially when they're going over the top the way Jack Nicholson does. Nicholson has been equally praised and criticized for his performance, with some calling it disturbing and others comical. Jack does go over-the-top, bringing a lot of manic energy to the role and yet, somehow, he's pitch-perfect. He's never unintentionally funny and his teeth-gnashing, vicious performance is unmatched in the realm of performances in horror films. Jack Nicholson may not be what Stephen King had in mind when he wrote Jack Torrance, but Jack Nicholson is Jack Torrance.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray is not perfect. Trivial complaints are that the film begins immediately without going to the menu and the menu itself is just the special features, reminding me of older Warner Bros. DVD's. As the film began, the picture quality was not 100% perfect, slightly fuzzy. Minutes later, the film looked stunning, crisp, and able to draw one's attention to the most minute details of a shot. Nearly every shot has so much more clarity than before. Warner Bros. has a habit of double-dipping with Kubrick films (and by double, I mean I've purchased four different editions of The Shining on two formats) so you may want to wait and see what happens before buying the Blu-Ray, but don't think for a second that you'll be disappointed. I'm sure even Kubrick himself would be at least 80% pleased with the result.<br /><br />To this day, The Shining is criticized for pacing issues but this complaint is all about audience response. I've always found the pacing to be an intoxicating element. The Shining is a rare horror film that gets under your skin and stays with you, growing better with each viewing. It has stood the test of time and will continue to grow in stature for many years to come. Its images still terrifying even with familiarity. It is one of the greatest horror films ever made.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

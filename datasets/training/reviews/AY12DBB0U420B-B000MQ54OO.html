<meta name="summary" content="Sappy Feat."></head><body><p>I recently viewed two movies on DVD regarding Emperor penguins. One was the documentary "March of the Penguins" and the other was "Happy Feet." I reviewed the "March" DVD and gave it five stars. Amazing film! Next came "Happy Feet."<br /><br />"Happy Feet" is an amazing movie to be sure, but only in one way. The animation is simply awesome. Some of the scenes look so realistic that it's hard to believe it's an animation. In places, the Antarctic landscape looks totally real and the penguins can hardly be distinguished from real Emperor penguins until they start singing and dancing and going through their absurd antics. The animation is really a remarkable feat! I feel like I'll never know what to believe when watching a movie from this time on. No wonder it got an academy award!<br /><br />The content of this remarkable movie, however, was sappy. Sappy, sappy, sappy. The story was weak, to say the least. No it was more than weak; it was ludicrous. How anyone could mix animation this marvelous with a plot this vapid is beyond me. What were they thinking? I don't know, maybe kids might enjoy it. Maybe it's a movie made especially for kids. Who knows? The music was engaging, but the whole story was so insipid that it ruled out any significant enjoyment of the movie. I sat there watching and listening in awe, and feeling ill as the story rolled out. Strange combination. Hmmmmm. Maybe it would have been better with the sound turned off.<br /><br />I'm sorry, folks. Maybe I shouldn't have watched the documentary first. Maybe the right way is to watch the cartoon first. Live in a fantasy world, where penguins walk around behaving like humans and dance and sing. It's an interesting thought. Then watch the "March" documentary and see the conditions as they really are.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

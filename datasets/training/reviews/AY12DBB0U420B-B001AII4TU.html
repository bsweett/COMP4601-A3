The animation was excellent and the movie was somehow appealing. Shrek 2 was OK., but I didn't get the same enjoyment as with the first. I guess that's the usual case with sequels. I felt a little burned out on the whole idea. Lately, my fianc&eacute;e, who liked the Shrek movies better than I did, picked up the Shrek the Third DVD when we last visited the local warehouse club. We watched it a couple evenings later. I was feeling negative toward viewing another Shreck thing and that may have tainted the experience.<br /><br />Shrek the Third is well done. It's a polished piece of work. The animation is terrific. In  places, the film seems so realistic I have difficulty believing it's an animation. If this is the first Shrek movie someone has viewed, I think they would probably find it interesting and amusing. However, this is the third one for me and it just doesn't have much to offer beyond the first two. The word "stale" comes to mind. The movie has some funny sight gags and there's a few mild chuckles here and there. The story is light and frivolous. My main reaction on watching was mild boredom and I began to wonder when it would be over.<br /><br />I'd say that Shrek the Third is stale and uninteresting. That about sums it up. If you haven't seen a Shrek movie you might enjoy it, although I'd suggest the original or even the second. Kids might enjoy it. For the rest, I'd suggest that there's better films available.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

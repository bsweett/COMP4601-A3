<meta name="summary" content="Stone's most VIEWER-FRIENDLY film"></head><body><p>Viewers of Oliver Stone films usually fall into two camps: those that admire his work and those that don't. I tend to like most of the director's films that I have watched and "World Trade Center" is no different.<br /><br />As is obvious by the title, the film takes place during that horrific day in September six years ago when the city of New York, along with the rest of the world, turned upside down due to the devastating attack on the city's landmark structures. Stone doesn't show too much of the archival footage of the death and destruction and that is probably for the best. The images are too ingrained into the American psyche that filmgoers and fill in the blanks, themselves.<br /><br />Instead, the film deals with two policemen trapped under the rumble and their struggles to survive, along with the worried families and the subsequent rescue attempts.<br /><br />Both Nicholas Cage - an actor that I usually don't like - and Micheal Pena acquaint themselves well as the cops. The actors really deserved Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, respectively. Maria Bello, Maggie Gyllenjaal, Broadway veteran Donna Murphy are quite good as suffering wives of the trapped and fallen.<br /><br />Impressive cinematography by Seamus McGarvey and Craig Armstrong's' powerful score are other highlights of Stone's film.<br /><br />It is obvious that Stone sought to make a film that is in honor of those that suffered that fateful day and the director succeeds in crafting something for the mainstream, something that he's probably not done before.</p></body></html>

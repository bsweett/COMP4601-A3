Who better to play a smarmy anchorman than Will Ferrell, but sadly this movie was so badly scripted, dawdling over its many raunchy one-liners, like a 9-year proud of his first dirty joke.  Outside of cutting a striking figure in a white jumpsuit, Christina Applegate failed to create the sexual tension this movie badly needed to keep it afloat.  The jokes and gags may have looked good on paper but failed to materialize on the screen.  Even the big fight between rival news gangs failed to deliver, despite bringing out Hollywood heavy-hitters like Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller.  All in all, this movie was a sad disappointment.  Will Ferrell can do much better than this.</p></body></html>

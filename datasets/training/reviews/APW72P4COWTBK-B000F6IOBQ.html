<meta name="summary" content="Good but NOT better than the first one!!!!!"></head><body><p>This is a good sequel: it has "car chase-like action", more blood, little bit slow-mo, romance and more special effects and fighting.<br /><br />Those were the pros. BUT...<br /><br />* Doesn't have "anime style or look" like in the first movie.<br /><br />* Selene's boyfriend looks LAME when he is a monster (in the fisrt movie he looked COOOL!!!).<br /><br />* Doesn't have to much shooting and slow-mo like in the first movie.<br /><br />* The final fight is not good as the first movie.<br /><br />* The story is not THAT interesting.<br /><br />P.S: Let's not forget that Blade, Matrix and the Crow had the exact same problem with their sequels.<br /><br />Adios.</p></body></html>

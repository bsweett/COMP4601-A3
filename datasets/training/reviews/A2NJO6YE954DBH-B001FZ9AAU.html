<meta name="summary" content="The best comic book superhero movie since "Spider-Man 2""></head><body><p>Once again I begin with a warning that you need to sit through the really, really long credits for what might be the best cameo appearance since Sean Connery showed up as King Richard the Lionheart at the end of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000092T6M">Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves</a>."  That was the last time I remember people really applauding a cameo in a film, although I should point out that everybody left at the end of the first showing of "Iron Man" were True Believers who instantly recognized the actor and the character as soon as the first words were out of their mouth.  Ironically, the cameo by Stan Lee in the film seemed to go right by the audience, because there was no reaction to what was a pretty good gag (it happens when Stark shows up at the big party).<br /><br />Now that I have that bit of business out of the way, let me say that "Iron Man" is the best comic book superhero movie I have seen since "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMQW">Spider-Man 2</a>."  I would say that the latter is better, mainly on the strength of Alfred Molina's wonderful performance as the villain and the great fight sequences between Spidey and Doc Ock that take place on the vertical as well as the horizontal axis, but "Iron Man" might be the more solid film (i.e., lower top but higher bottom).  There was a point when the number of comic books that Marvel was putting out exploded (e.g., the New Universe titles) and I dispaired over all of the idiotic cloning with Spider-Man and was down to reading only two Marvel titles: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785107576">Daredevil</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078512764X">Iron Man</a>.  This was back when Frank Miller was doing DD and Tony Stark was a full-blown alcoholic.  Daredevil might have been cooler, but as Iron Man, Stark always had the advantage that he was a regular guy, by which I mean that he did not have any superpowers.  He was just a really smart guy who could invent the gadgets that would make Iron Man work (eat your heart out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000294TC4">Ned Kelly</a>).  That is certainly what we get with director Jon Favreau's pre-summer blockbuster, with the added angst of Stark growing a conscience and using his armored alter-ego to help restore balance to his own little corner of the universe at war.<br /><br />Ultimately the best parts of the movie are the opening act, in which Stark is captured (Afghanistan today instead of Vietnam of the Sixties)and has to built the metallic grey Tin Woodsman on roids prototype armor, and the second act, where he works out the new suit.  This movie has two or three of the best violent slapstick gags you have ever seen in one of these movies, which engenders some of the biggest laughs.  The origin of the character is fairly faithful, for being updated, to what happened in "Tales of Suspense" #39, which was plotted by Stan Lee, scripted by his brother Larry Leiber, drawn by Don Heck, with a cover art by Jack Kirby (who created the character's original look, although it was Steve Ditko who first drew the red and gold armored version).  There certainly is more than a touch of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR0570">Transformers</a>" to the way Stark dons the Iron Man armor, but as much as I would give credit to the specific effects in this movie, attention must be paid to the screenwriting teams of Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N6TX1I">Children of Men</a>") and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway.  For all of the humor in the script, there is a strong thread of serious stuff extending throughout this film.<br /><br />As Tony Stark, Robert Downey, Jr., a superb actor whose skills in the verbal repartee department were honed on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V8952K">Ally McBeal</a>," may well be the most glib superhero we have seen on the silver screen.  Certainly he is more glib than we would every have suspected Stark to be, but of course Downey's personal life clearly echoes the character ark of his character (it is that resonance as well as his undeniable talents that make him perfect for the role).  As Pepper Potts, Gwenyth Paltrow is more of a romantic  figure for Stark than she was in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785118608">comic book</a>, especially since Happy Hogan (director Favreau) has been relegated to a minor role as Stark's bodyguard to make room for the character of Jim Rhodes.  However, the point is not so much potential romance as it is the fact that with Paltrow we have an actress who can go toe to toe with Downey in quick paced nuanced conversation (although many will think that Downey's best scenes are with his robotic assistant with the fire extinguisher).  Besides, by have Rhodes instead of Hogan we not only get another acting talent on the level of the Downey and Paltrow with Terrence Howard, but as fans of the comic book know (and the movie acknowledges), one day down the road Jim is going to get to be in the red and gold suit.<br /><br />Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is set up as a godfather to Tony Stark and a regent to Stark Industries instead of being a rival munitions magnate, which provides a bit of Oedipal conflict to the proceedings and compels the big fight at the end to be with Iron Monger (I was actually hoping for Titanium Man even though I was half expecting the Mandarian).  But most people who come to see this movie are not going to know any of this stuff, and even most of the comic book fans who will end up making repeat trips to the theater to see this one are not going to be old enough to remember the original Virginia "Pepper" Potts who ended up with Happy Hogan versus the "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785121382">The Ultimates</a>" version of the character.  All that really matters is that the cast and characters are a perfect mesh and the people who put this movie together should be thinking not just about a sequel but about a series.  With this launching platform, Iron Man could well replace Superman in the Big Three of comic book superheroes in the movies along with Spider-Man and Batman.</p></body></html>

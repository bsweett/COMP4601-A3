One lesser reason the film is good is the surprise ending, which is a shocker and comes at you from out of nowhere.  However, I don't think the movie depends completely on the ending; it works regardless.  In fact, I don't think the ending is all that great, for reasons I will mention later.<p>The story centers around a supposed drug bust gone bad.  Roughly 90 million dollars worth of narcotics were on a ship and a group of notorious criminals were assembled to get the money.  The very beginning of the film shows that things got out of hand and the boat actually exploded, with practically all people in the vicinity being killed.<p>The criminals were chosen by a character named Keyser Sose (so-say) who is so renowned for his criminal actions that the mere mention of his name brings panic and fear.  We see a flashback of his cold blooded nature: when thieves took over his house and threatened his family, he walked in calmly, shot his family first, and then shot the bad guys.  The implication is that he will kill instantly and without remorse.  He is almost mythical, no one has ever seen him and lived to tell it, and some don't even believe in his existence.  All five criminals (played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollack, Kevin Spacey, Benicio del Torro, and Stephen Baldwin) have done something to hurt Sose in the past, and so this is their chance to redeem themselves.  The cast is great, all bring the proper amount of intensity to their roles.<p>After the explosion, only Verbal (Spacey) is left.  He is brought in for questioning, given immunity for his information, and on his way out the door, answers a few more questions for Agent Kujay (Chazz Palminteri), where he talks about the whole situation.  We only see what happened through Verbal's eyes.  In this way, the movie is like the classic Rashomon or the more recent and much less effective Basic, where we see information through the eyes of one very closely involved.  How much of what we see is the truth is the real mystery.<p>The ending is a surprise, and very well done, but I don't think the movie gave enough clues in order for us as viewers to figure it out.  In that sense, it almost cheats a little, because it's easy to fool someone when you don't give them a chance to solve the riddle.  Even keeping that in mind, though, this movie is one of the better mystery thrillers I have seen in some time.</p></body></html>

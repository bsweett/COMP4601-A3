As I have said before, Pixar cam seemingly do no wrong, and this film continues their winning ways. The detailing is amazing to see. The image of the Paris skyline at night could be used in a Parisian tourism ad. The wizards at Pixar get better at their craft with each picture. The story is touching as well, and that's what really counts: to be true to yourself and be what you're meant to be. The truly funniest parts are when Remy(the lead hero and main rodent) is learning to control Linguini(the clean-up boy of the restaurant) by means of pullng Linguini's hair. Way too funny! All in all, this film is as good as any of Pixar's films, and better than you might expect considering the main hero is a rat. Get this fine film on DVD and go to Paris and enjoy!</p></body></html>

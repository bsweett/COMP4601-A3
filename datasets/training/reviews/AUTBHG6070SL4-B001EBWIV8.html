The numerous fight scenes are well choreographed and wired. The visual style takes what worked in the original Matrix and took it a step beyond.<br /><br />But somehow, it was too much and not enough. The action scenes were technically outstanding, but just seemed to go on and on. A little more resolution, a little sooner would have worked a lot better for me. The invading electro-squid were great animation, but somehow incidental - something in the background, not quite connected to the action. The visual style took what originality there was in the original Matrix, and drove it well past anything that made sense.<br /><br />Most of all (or least of all) was the inflection infection that flattened every spoken line in the movie. It was quite an achievement to take actors as good as Fishburne and Moss, and turn their voices in to the verbal equivalent of typewritten text. As near as I could tell, the directors couldn't get any variation into Keanu Reeves's voice, but they could get it out of everyone else's so they did.<br /><br />It's showy, it's got action, it's got good effects. It just doesn't have the spirit that leaves me caring whether the heroes succeed or fail.<br /><br />And it does have an obvious come-on to a sequel. I guess the worst part is knowing that I'll probably watch that, too.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Moon"></head><body><p>Duncan Jones, director and co-writer of Moon, has a lot to live up to. His father is legendary glam rocker and consummate performer David Bowie. While not exactly following in the footsteps of his old man, when you're the heir of such talent and originality a lot is expected of you. Add to that the weight of making a movie that nearly completely surrounds one actor, and the chips don't exactly seem stacked in your favor. Duncan Jones, though, handles the pressure admirable and creates a modern sci-fi masterpiece.<br /><br />Astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) has been on the moon for nearly three years harvesting Helium 3 to send back to Earth to help solve the energy crisis, alone except for the moon base's computer GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey), and unable to make live transmissions to earth due to a faulty satellite. Nearing the end of his service, and preparing to return home, Sam gets into an accident with a Moon Rover when he goes out to fix a harvester. After being treated, Sam goes to check on possible meteor damage, but things start to go awry when Sam finds a crashed Moon Rover with a barely living Sam in it.<br /><br /> As I've stated before, in my opinion science fiction is at it's best when it's trying to relate to the world around us. Duncan Jones, and first time screenwriter Nathan Park, create a believable future in which an energy crisis on earth dictates the need for another energy source off planet. In so doing, the premise leads to an indictment of the corporate world's lack of sanctity in human life. The screenplay is masterfully written, creating real characters that you feel for, in a very real world.<br /><br />Among what really makes this film pop is the visual style and the special effects. Duncan realized the Moon base in a visual style reminiscent of the Nostromo in Alien, giving us something to latch on to in science fiction. Also adding to the realism, just like in Alien, is that fact that we're not seeing an amazingly clean, bright future, but a real, and somewhat gritty future. For a film made on the cheap during the writers strike over a period of only 33 days, the special effects look more real than most of big blockbusters that have come out this past summer. One of the reasons for this is because rather than use CGI to render the outside scenes and special effect, Jones chose to use miniatures and visual effects lending more realism to scenes that could have possibly looked cartoonish and taken away from the gritty dramatic feel of the rest of the film.<br /><br />What really shines through in this film though is the acting. Sam Rockwell is a real tour de force playing two sides of the same coin. Playing the Sam who has been on the Moon he plays a calmer more plaintive version of Sam, and in playing the new Sam to arrive on the Moon base Rockwell plays him as an arrogant hothead. Never at any point do we get the feeling that these two characters are talking to air, or that they aren't in the same room, Rockwell's interactions with himself always feel genuine and believable, which is hard to attain, especially when practically the whole movie requires him to act against an actor who isn't there.<br /><br />This is one of the rare films I don't have anything bad to say about. I highly recommend this film if you like science fiction, but unlike most sci-fi that comes out nowadays, this isn't an action packed extravaganza. This is a great character study with subtext that you can grab hold of. But even more than that, it's a very entertaining ride!<br /><br />5/5</p></body></html>

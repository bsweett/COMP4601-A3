<meta name="summary" content="Let's show some pity to that pitiful second coming"></head><body><p>Surprising new enactment of the sacrifice of a man who had always been in contact with the other side of reality in a vast fight against Lucifer to whom the world has been totally abandoned by God. And the sacrifice is supposed to save the world. Not by redeeming the sins of human beings. But by preventing the birth of Lucifer's son and the total take-over of the world by him. The strangest element is that everything is purely haphazard. There is no plan, no real perspective known and controlled by anyone, especially not God, and least of all Lucifer. It is pure opportunism on their sides and human beings are always taken in-between these two famously inconsequent and irresponsible characters and they have to accept, follow and suffer what the other two in their big conflict don't even know they produce. Even Archangel Gabriel is totally spaced out and corrugated and Lucifer will punish him by burning his wings and making him human and sensitive to suffering. Let's hope for eternity. The special effects are from time to time agreeable and pleasant but never really outstanding. The story is messy and obscure and the spear that had been used by a Roman soldier to pierce Jesus' side on the cross and had disappeared for some time reappears by pure luck somewhere in Mexico of all places. Na?ve. And we don't know at all what's the use of it and what it brings to the story. The second coming of Lucifer's son is a failure. The second coming of some Jesus, new or old, is also a failure since Lucifer has to resuscitate him for him not to go to Hell for eternity. And they repeat as often as possible that He has a plan for anyone of us. In fact He and They have nothing for none of us. We are lost in a messy haphazard conflict between a truant God and a totally disorganized Lucifer. That's what divine providence amounts to: nothing at all.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></body></html>

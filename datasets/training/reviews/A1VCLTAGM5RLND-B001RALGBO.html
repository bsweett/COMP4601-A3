The plot unfolds as storms start hitting the entire surface of Earth. We watch it as it turns colder and colder until it suddenly goes into a new ice age.<br /><br />I love seeing New York city under water it was great special effects when the sea turn into a giant wave it got taller then the Statue of Liberty people start running which was so go about this movie cause it was like Hurrican Katrina distroyed New Orleans.<br /><br />What didn't make since to me was a cop in this movie who saw a couple in a Taxi the couple were beating on the window for help but that cop kept on saying "I can't understand what your saying" cause they speak French it's obvious that they wanted to get out cause of the storm.</p></body></html>

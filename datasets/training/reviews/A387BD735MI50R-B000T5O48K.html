<meta name="summary" content="Absorbing Psychological Drama"></head><body><p>I picked up this DVD casually, not knowing anything about what a distinguished career this material had as an award-winning stage play. I just grabbed it thinking it might be a sci-fi thriller to pass a few hours with. It is labeled as a "thriller," - but it's not sci-fi, and actually, it's not a "thriller" either. That label is a misnomer. This is an intense psychological drama about obsessive-compulsive disorder.<br /><br />It's an unflinching portrayal of a couple's descent into madness. Or is it? You may not be absolutely certain, because there are a few suggestions along the way that the couple's paranoia - their conviction that bugs have been implanted in them, that Government agents are experimenting on them - may not be total hallucination. But assuming the couple is suffering from genuine delusions, their imaginings spiral them down into shocking, brutal alienation.<br /><br />Their relationship seems to start innocently enough. The drifter Ashley Judd meets seems to be the polar opposite of the abusive husband she's been trying to get out of her life. This new man is strangely gentle and literate. But then he starts to see tiny bugs infesting the dingy motel room where they now live together. And soon she sees the bugs too.<br /><br />Some psychologists such as Erich Fromm have written about how most of us end up acceding to the particular insanity of our respective societies as the inevitable price of being accepted as a group member. Here Ashley Judd is all too ready to buy into her new boyfriend's delusions because she has been lonely and his companionship is a lifeline. But what a price she pays.<br /><br />Director William Friedkin' tends to be a little droning and pretentious in his commentary. He laces his remarks with references to Proust's stream of consciousness, and to Cleckley's ideas about "the mask of sanity" that we all wear. He uses neologisms he doesn't seem to be aware aren't legitimate words. For example, he several times refers to the boyfriend's imaginings as being "insiduous," perhaps a clutch after some high-flown meaning half-way between "insidious" and "assiduous." Still, most of his comments are intelligent. He points out the many layers of meaning that the title "Bug" has here - from a sense of the literal insects the couple believes are bedeviling them - to a sense of being "bugged," spied on, kept under surveillance - to a sense of being pervasively infected.<br /><br />Ashley Judd, Michael Shannon, and Harry Connick act out all these levels of meaning brilliantly. Obsessive-compulsive disorder of this magnitude is rarely tackled on film because such inner turmoil is difficult to make cinematic. But Friedkin and the cast truly succeed in making this movie visually and emotionally arresting. The only other film that comes to mind as being comparable to it is Roman Polanski's classic "Repulsion," which you might want to check out if you still have the energy after this grueling, but fascinating, expedition to extremity.</p></body></html>

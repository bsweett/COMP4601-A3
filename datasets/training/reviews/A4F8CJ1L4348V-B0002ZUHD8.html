<meta name="summary" content="Very close to being correct"></head><body><p>The reason that I really liked this movie is the probability of it being very close to being portrayed correct. The director's cut of this movie is much better than the PG-13 version of it. It is much more explainitory and in depth story and the characters involved. This is probably my all time favorite story of King Arthur. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes movies about Camelot and King Arthur.</p></body></html>

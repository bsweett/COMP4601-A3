<meta name="summary" content="Zellweger looks miserable in this lame echo of "Diary""></head><body><p>Tours of duty in "Chicago" and "Cold Mountain" have moved Renee Zellweger past the Bridget Jones character, and it shows on her moony, perturbed face in "The Edge of Reason." It's a sequel of absurd slapstick - in contrast to the mannered comedy of the original "Diary,"  -  and sitcom trappings need jolts of inspired whimsy. But Hugh Grant drops by for a only cup of coffee and Colin Firth, as the constipated Marc Darcy, wraps himself in even more discomfort than he did in "Diary."<br /><br />That leaves Zellweger, who grinned and cried and stuffed herself into max support bras with zeal her first go round, earning nominations and perverse recognition for size swapping. Now, it's paycheck time, and little more, and no wonder Zellweger shed her chunky monkey physique so quickly post-production: She plays one miserable character. This is not the Jones you'd want to know.<br /><br />Director Beeban Kidron has designed "Edge of Reason" to make Bridget not a heroine but a lightning rod of unappealing, embarrassing sequences - in a pig slop, at Marc's lawyer ball, on the ski slopes, in, yes, a Thai prison (where the girls shrug off their communal, disease-ridden existence for an impromptu rendition of Madonna's "Like A Virgin.")<br /><br />What was it again that was so special about Ms. Jones? Is staring at someone as they sleep really that endearing a trait? How about suffering three increasingly annoying, meddling friends? Kidron seems to have forgotten Bridget's plucky cuteness - there isn't one scene in "Edge of Reason" where Zellweger is allowed to look, well, attractive for very long without being drenched or slopped or having her hair ruined.</p></body></html>

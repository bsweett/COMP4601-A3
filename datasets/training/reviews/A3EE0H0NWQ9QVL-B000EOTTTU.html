<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful and Brave 'New World'"></head><body><p>'The New World' envelops the viewer with laguorous grandeur.  The story is familiar; we have known since our earliest days the story of Captain John Smith and his people's pilgrimage to the new world.  But the presentation in this film shakes the dust off our familiarity.  The camera shots and acting are expert for making us feel like we, too, are on that same journey with all its awe and innocense.  Refreshingly, the portrayal of natives and pilgrims is not clearly drawn as just heroes and villains for either side.  The natives presented bring an emotional spark that the history books and our own imaginations somehow lacked.  Then because of an unfortunate state of events, we are also presented with a romantic triangle with its fateful and beautiful consequences.  The realities of hardship as well as the spirit of freedom are underscored admirably throughout the film.<br /><br />If "all is fair in love and war," then this may be the fairest movie of them all.  The chemistry between John Smith (Colin Farrell) and Pocahantas, surnamed Rebecca, (Q'orianka Kilcher) is marvelous, and the beautiful cinematography is certainly alluring.  The music too, with its simple orchestration, highlights events with primitive crescendos and nice nuances.  The way the settlers and the Native Americans are portrayed is absorbing enough to keep our interest.  Nevertheless, this movie may be of personal taste.  For what it is, it is excellent, but for some it may be a transcending voyage, for others it may only induce a nap.</p></body></html>

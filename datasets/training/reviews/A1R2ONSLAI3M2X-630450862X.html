<meta name="summary" content="Don't Mess With Carrie......"></head><body><p>Again, leave it to Stephen King to give us another great story. Sissy Spacek gives a wonderful performance as Carrie..... a girl with supernatural powers. Coming from an abusive home with a very strict mother, we feel sorry for Carrie. Especially on prom night when her fellow classmates, known to pick at her constantly, play a prank on her unleashing a rage in Carrie and her supernatural powers. Those who have treated her badly end up paying for being so mean to her. Good acting and good suspense. Will always be one of those movies that no one will forget.</p></body></html>

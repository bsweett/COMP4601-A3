<meta name="summary" content="writing the script as you go. . ."></head><body><p>In the DVD bonus materials, Sydney Pollack admits that casting and shooting on this film started without a script.  His comments suggested that this movie was written as they went.  All the silly plot and character twists are proof that approach was taken to this movie, start to finish.<br /><br />The Interpreter starts quickly, suspensefully, gets bogged down in the middle, and has a corny, boring ending.  The first hour of the movie is promising.  The second hour is almost regrettable.<br /><br />What derails it is the forced twists and turns that only make sense due to the injection of a (rather uninteresting) back story.  Because I do not want to spoil the entire film, I'll leave out details.  Suffice it to say, the movie would have been better had it followed the plotline suggested very early on, i.e. that Nicole Kidman's character, Silvia Broome, simply stumbled upon an assassination plot.  Instead, her past is tied in with the events that unfold throughout the rest of the film.<br /><br />It's as if Hollywood writers and/or directors these days cannot resist bringing multiple subplots together to (artificially) create suspense.  Not every so-called "action thriller" needs an ironic climax.  Most films in that genre do not seem to use the device particularly well -- most seem to overuse it -- and The Interpreter is one such film.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman does a great job with the character and "script" but her character is ridiculously improbable.  At the risk of giving away too much, a person of Ms. Broome's (political/activist) background would never get a job as an interpreter at the UN.<br /><br />Sean Penn's character, Tobin Keller, is interesting and well-played, but he seems more New York City detective, maybe low-level FBI, than Secret Service Agent.  Looking at him on the screen you can almost smell the alcohol on his breath.  While clearly a bright guy that knows his job, Keller does not seem like the buttoned-down, highly-disciplined prototypical Secret Service agent.<br /><br />The portrayal of the UN as a body that is greatly concerned about "genocide" in Africa rings hollow.  In reality, the UN has sat by idly while various African nations have torn themselves apart through civil war, inter-tribal fighting, genocide, political corruption, AIDS, and a score of other ills.  Given the reality, Pollacks' UN lovefest is puzzling to say the least.</p></body></html>

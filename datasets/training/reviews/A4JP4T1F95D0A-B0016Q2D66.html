<meta name="summary" content="Kind of a Downer"></head><body><p>This is really a pessimistic movie about what constitutes the ideal way of middle class American life in the 50's.  I really get what the story was going for, but there was no let up in the darkness.  Great actors with a mini titanic reunion with Bates, Winslet and Dicaprio as the leads.  Good well fleshed out characters.  The problem is the like ability.  You have Winslet who seems to have everything a woman in the 50's could want--a nice house, handsome husband, 2 kids.  But she is incapable of being happy.  Dicaprio wants this ideal life, but he is unhappy with his job, cheats on his wife and is not very compassionate to her needs.  It is a decent movie, but certainly don't expect a happy moment anywhere in the whole thing.</p></body></html>

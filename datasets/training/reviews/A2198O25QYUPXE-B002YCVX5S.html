<meta name="summary" content="Tarantino's WWII Twist"></head><body><p>"Inglourious Basterds" is a fictional World War II film. To date it is Quentin Tarantino's highest-grossing movie.<br /><br />The film narrative boldly shifts away from the norm of factually based WWII pictures and presents a story where the war could potentially end by aiming to assassinate the entire German High Command.<br /><br />The story is multilayered and represents several points of views. The cast is loaded with personalities who are absorbing and Christoph Waltz's portrayal of SD Colonel Hans Landa is marvelous. On one hand Landa appears gentle and compassionate and on the other he is cold, ferocious and without a glimmer of mercy.<br /><br />Some viewers might be unsettled by a few violent scenes but any true admirer of Tarantino's work will feel right at home.<br /><br />Shot in France and Germany the cinematography is fantastic and it is a unique movie loaded with great scenes.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

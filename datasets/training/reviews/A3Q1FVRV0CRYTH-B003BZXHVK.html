The humans have created a cure thanks to a young mutant with the ability to cause other mutants powers to be null and void in his presence and they intend to hold this out to the public for their use.  For any mutant who wants a normal life, here is your chance to get it.  The only problem is that Magneto and his band of baddies decides to wage war on the humans in protest.  It's at this point the humans decide to use this cure as a weapon against mutantkind which results in an all out war.  In the meantime, Jean Grey (Famke) who was assumed dead has come back to life in the form of Phoenix, her alter ego and has joined forces with Magneto.  The X-Men must fight to save the world from Magneto while battling there emotional ties to Jean (especially Wolverine)  Also, we have some mutants (Beast and Rogue primarily) who may even welcome the cure, and Rogue who has concerns about her relationship with Bobby (Iceman) beings that she can't touch him, and when he starts showing interest in Shadowcat, Rogue strongly conciders taking the cure for herself.  With the inclusion of mutants like Jugernut, Shadowcat, Angel and Beast you'd think it may get confusing, but the film flows nicely and explains everything very well.  It may not be the best of the bunch (X2 was by far the best) it still holds your interest and delivers solid hollywood entertainment, and Miss Famke delivers the best acting in the bunch as the very tempermental Phoenix.  I do have to say they went out of there way to make sure a fourth was damn near impossible, but even at that, they ended on a great note despite what the critics have to say about it.</p></body></html>

And that?s what The Unforgiven is: a winner. Hackman plays the sleazy and sadistic local sheriff of Big Whiskey, a town somewhere in the outback of Wyoming where the local prostitutes are determined to seek revenge on the guys who maimed one of them - and they've pooled their savings and have offered a bounty. Eastwood and Freeman, old partners, have retired but, down on their luck, they are persuaded by circumstances to take aim on the bad guys one last time. Then, when they meet Hackman's style of resistance, it becomes bigger than just a bounty hunt; it turns into the usual Eastwood confrontation: Good vs. Evil.<br />A winner, not to be missed. All the Academy Awards it won were not a mistake.</p></body></html>

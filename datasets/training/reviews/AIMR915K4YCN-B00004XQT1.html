<meta name="summary" content="Sociopath In A Silk Suit..."></head><body><p>Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a terrifying mess. He's a hollow shell among other hollow shells. His life consists of meaningless ritual and routine. Patrick has no sense of who he is or what he is doing. He is only aware of his own greed and inner hatred for all around him. He's a perfect physical specimen, perfectly wrapped in designer suits. His self-pampering shower regimen is a wonder to behold! When Patrick has sex with two women at once, he only notices his own reflection in the mirror. Patrick is a narcissist with no discernable personality. On the exterior, he is handsome, well groomed, and "together", while his interior is a frenzy of violence and death. Patrick is coming apart. He is no longer able to keep his inner deadness at bay. His friends are as unaware of his problems as they are of their own, living only to burn up the vast amounts of money they make in the most impressive ways possible. Patrick finally snaps, releasing his inner beast to murder those who he sees as unlike himself, which turns out to be anyone / everyone who comes in contact with him. To add to this insanity, things happen to make it unclear whether Patrick has actually killed anyone at all. Is he a prolific serial-killer or does he just have an over active and demented fantasy life? He's confused and so are we. He watches porno and slasher flicks which mysteriously look like events in his life. He carries one victim right out the front door of his penthouse apartment building, and loads it into the trunk of a cab. This leaves a long, wide trail of blood right in plain sight of many passers-by. Did this even happen? No one is certain. I loved this movie's view of the 1980s, especially the ridiculous nightlife and empty headed music. Patrick and his fellow business sharks are more plastic than flesh and blood with no concern for anyone but themselves. Patrick wants to fit in with them, but his own lack of a soul causes him nothing but misery. He is truly a repulsive creature, a living falsehood, a homicidal maniac with no real reason to kill. Patrick is the good-looking bottle of poison. Do not touch, unless you want to die! I found Patrick's utter void to be far more disturbing than the violence he perpetrates. He is totally lost, without hope or any idea of how to live. His misogeny is just a symptom of his own terminal condition. Patrick is a walking corpse. AMERICAN PSYCHO is a great character study of a man bereft of character. Bale plays his role with ease and confidence. Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

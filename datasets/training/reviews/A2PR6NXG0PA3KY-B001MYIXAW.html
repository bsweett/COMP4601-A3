None of my best friends are zombies.<br /><br />But this film comes highly recommended, both the original Swedish production and the American remake. Am I missing something, say I to myself? Is there a metaphysical or psychological depth to the vampire imagery that I ought to probe? Okay, bring it on! Besides, it's in Swedish, my own birth language which I love to hear ...<br /><br />... and it's an eerily beautiful film, I have to admit. A pellucid love story between a twelve-year-old boy and a twelve-eon-old vampirette. In a sense , it's the same story as that of "The Makropoulos Affair", the dark disturbing modern opera by Leos Janacek, the tale of an immortal woman who has outlived both love and her endless succession of mortal lovers. The boy will be one, a mortally aging lover. He will become the tormented 'father' seen haplessly tapping the red sap of victims for his still twelve-year-old 'child' in some bleak snowy future. It's the vampirette Eli's tragedy that we are, I think, to feel empathy for; she knows how dire a life poor Oskar will have until she rewards him with the final sacrament of death. Hay, it's not a bed of roses, being an undying vampire ...<br /><br />But does it really "mean" anything? You tell me. If it's just 'entertainment', why all the symbols, all the aura? This is not a 'scary' movie. Not one at which your girlfriend will gasp and snuggle against your shoulder for comfort. It's actually a pretentious art film ... but not uninteresting in its genre. And now I'm tempted to 'waste' another 90 minutes watching the American remake, just for the sake of cultural comparison.<br /><br />****<br />Days later. I did it. I watched the American remake. The comparison of the two is, for me, more interesting than either film by itself. Here's my review of "Let Me IN":<br /><br />And a bloody weird one, too! And an equally weird 'purpose' in my mind in renting it. A few days ago I rented, watched, and reviewed the Swedish film  L?t den R&auml;tte Komma In (Let the Right One Come In). I gave that film a four-star rating; since it is a much better film, I've given this American 'cover' only three stars. But honestly, the ratings are irrelevant. This is not so much a review here and now, but rather a comparison -- thoughtful, I hope -- of the two versions of film-making.<br /><br />In many ways, the American film simply re-shoots the scenes and re-speaks the script of the Swedish film. But the American film is edited differently; it begins in the middle of the Swedish script and then relies on the good ol' Hollywood flashback tricks. One can't demand Originality in a re-make, logically enough, but it seems to me that the American film discarded much of the Originality of the Swedish film in favor of some Hollywood clich&eacute;s. The American film is radically gorier than the Swedish. More shocking visually, and less lyrical. It's unreservedly a "Horror" film, with lots of moments when the squeamish or overwrought viewer will instinctively look away. The American vampire exhibits more physically vampirish abilities and traits -- more explicit supernatural powers. There's a key comparison: explicit versus implicit! Or: blatant versus subtle, if you will.<br /><br />The 12-year-old boys are fundamentally different also. The Swedish boy is appealingly vulnerable and potentially "redeemable" both morally and psychologically. The American boy is a loathesome little peeping-tom degenerate from the start. The viewer will agonize at the Swedish boy's seduction into evil. The same viewer (me, that is) will expect the American boy to succumb all along.<br /><br />Perhaps the most startling difference is in the moral contextualization of the story in the two films. The American film is replete with specifically Christian religious symbols and allusions. The action is set in 1983, for the opportunity that time-frame gives of showing Ronald Reagan addressing the nation, over a TV in the background, on the essentially Christian values of America. When those Christian values are disregarded, Reagan tells us, Evil will reign. The boy's mother, in the American film, is a religious enthusiast; her evangelical 'notions' are a chief cause of her marital collapse, as hinted by the unseen father on the telephone to the boy. There's a prominent picture of Jesus Christ on the wall, in the American film, in one of the nastiest scenes. None of this overt Christian context is present in the Swedish film, where unreleased sexuality is more the catalyst than religious hysteria.<br /><br />So then, is the American film to be understood as an examination of, or assault on, religious frenzy in America? I think it could be taken that way. However, that gets murky very quickly when you remember that a belief in vampires (and other occult phenomena) is profoundly incompatible with Christian theology. A sincere Christian can't possibly accept vampires -- or the emergence of Evil independent of God's Omnipotence -- and therefore the American film explicitly derides Christian certainty as bunk. That's too metaphysically naive and murky for my taste.<br /><br />The Swedish film raises no theological/metaphysical questions. It's completely and coherently a psychological drama, closer in affect to the poetry of Baudelaire than the spooky tales of Stephen King. It's a "art" film, the Swedish one, a portrayal of psychological victimization and obsession, with a tragic ending. As the boy in the American film departs with his vampire friend, one foresees the serial wickedness the pair will accomplish. As the boy in the Swedish film departs, one sees instead the suffering he will experience as the enabler of an eternally deceptive life/blood sucker.</p></body></html>

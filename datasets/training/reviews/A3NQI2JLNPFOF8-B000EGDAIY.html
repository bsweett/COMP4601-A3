This, of course, is the American remake of the Japanese horror film, Ju-On, written and directed by Takashi Shimizu. Shimizu also happened to write and direct the American remake; and it shows. Not only because it takes place in Tokyo, but the overall atmosphere and 'feel' to the film. Shimizu didn't try to 'Americanize' his style with this, nor should he. Anyone who has seen alot of Asian horror would recognize the techniques in this film. And chances are, if you've seen alot of Asian horror, you're probably really into it. And if you're into it then you'll probably like this. If you're idea of a good horror movie involves something on the lines of 'Scream', then I can tell you right now that you won't like this. This is not the kind of movie meant for the 'dumb teenager' crowd.</p></body></html>

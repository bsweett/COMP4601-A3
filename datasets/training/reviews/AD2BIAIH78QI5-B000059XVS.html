No, it's Anthony Quinn to Anthony Quayle, only two of the remarkable cast assembled for this desert epic tale. Who else is in this film? Besides O'Toole, Quinn, and Quayle, try Omar Sharif, Jose Ferrer, Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guinness, and Arthur Kennedy. How can you miss with a cast like that? Dead on perfect, every actor.<p>The audience is left by and large to decide for themselves whether Lawrence was a mystic, a fanatic, a rogue, a meglomaniac, or anything else that comes to mind. We see his start, from an obscure British army officer merely delivering a message to Prince Faisal to a commander of an arab army sweeping the Turkish Empire back as World War I rages in the Middle East as well. Here's a movie that really is a feast for the eyes, as nearly every few minutes there's an incredible shot of desert caravans or looting armies or a triumphant Lawrence ego-tripping out as he parades atop a derailed train.  &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; made the careers of both O'Toole and Sharif, and deservedly so. If you haven't yet seen this granddaddy of all epics, hoist yourself onto a camel and hunt it down.</p></body></html>

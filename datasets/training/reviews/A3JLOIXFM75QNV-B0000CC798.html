<meta name="summary" content="Way better than the first"></head><body><p>Super hero movies can be rather tough to watch. They are either very good (Superman) or very bad (The Hulk). X-Men 2, is probably my favorite Super Hero film. It doesn't even compare to the first movie. That is so rare for a sequel. Aside from Halle Berry, the rest of the cast is enjoyable and fun to watch. We really get to delve deeper into their universe and deeper into certain characters. We learn more about Wolverine, Prof X, and Jean Grey, just some of my favorite characters. Nightcrawler is also a fun new character. The plot is quite interesting and engaging. Once the film gets going, there is plenty of suspense and action and romantic intrigue. Its a perfectly paced film and, like I mentioned, leaps and bounds better than X-Men.</p></body></html>

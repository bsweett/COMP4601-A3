<meta name="summary" content="The makeup was brilliant"></head><body><p>The story let it down somewhat.  I thought a much better job could be done of Thatcher's life. Many of the important moments in her life were almost missed concentrating on trivial. Still it did keep my interest up throughout.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the characters were not properly developed in the movie. Many appeared very superficial.<br /><br />However, the acting was excellent, Meryl Streep performance was extremely good. As were most of the other actors.<br /><br />What I thought was brilliant was the makeup, they used on Maryl Streep. The way they could  make her look older and younger. I was very impressed with that.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent British horror thriller!"></head><body><p>A group of activists accidently frees infected Chimpanzees from a lab causing to contaminate the population of England's folks. 28 Days Later after the disaster of England, a young man named " Jim" ( Cillain Miller) has woked up in a hospital from a coma only to find himself as the last man in London but at night, ravenous blood-thirsty red-eyed fast running zombie-like beings come out for blood, he joins a group of human survivors to make it out alive by defeating the infected undead.<br /><br />A killer of a thriller that blends zombie movies, the dangers of bio-hazards, gore, great acting, horror, sci-fi, action, and drama into one unique and shocking horror movie from the UK. The DVD here has 3 alternate endings not shown in theaters with great extras like commentary by the director, Featurette, advetising, storyboards, music video and more makes this a must own for horror buffs out there.<br /><br />Also recommended: " Nightmare City ( a.k.a.

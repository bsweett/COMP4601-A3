<meta name="summary" content="Actors hit their marks in Austrian love story"></head><body><p>Edward Norton, Jessica Biel, Paul Giamatti, and Rufus Sewell all do yeoman's work in "The Illusionist," a visually lush love story/thriller set in Vienna.  These four actors are the high points of a movie that is also well served by its visual style, a fun paean to the grainy silent movies of yore.  A solid movie to be sure, but not one that stays with you long after the movie is over.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" tells the love story of Eisenheim the Illusionist (Norton) and Sophie (Biel).  Eisenheim wasn't born an illusionist, of course - he was the child of the cabinet maker who made furniture for the nobility, including Sophie's family.  But kids don't understand the caste system, and the two kids become childhood sweethearts until the adults discover their secret and break them asunder - Sophie is destined to marry a great lord.<br /><br />Eisenheim departs to wander the earth, and he comes back to Vienna 15 years later as one of the most famous illusionists in Europe.  His act thrills the Viennese public, including Inspector Uhl (Giamatti, perfect as always), who is also an amateur prestidigitator.  Uhl convinces his lord, the Crown Prince (Sewell, looking shockingly like Jude Law) to attend a show.  The Crown Prince does so, and brings his (reluctant) fiance, who just happens to be Sophie.  And thus are Sophie and Eisenheim reunited, and they learn that old flames still smolder.<br /><br />What follows is a romantic struggle where Eisenheim and Sophie try to break free from the Crown Prince, who is one of those classic movie villains who insists on marrying the heroine even though she will have nothing to do with him.  Sewell plays his part well, but unfortunately the Crown Prince comes off as little more than a spoiled brat and doesn't really rise to the level of a great foil for Eisenheim.<br /><br />Another unfortunate aspect of any movie featuring magicians is that the real magicians are already working in Hollywood special effects.  So while Eisenheim's audience may be dazzled as Eisenheim makes an orange tree grow on stage, or have two butterflies carry a handkerchief, or even conjure up shades of the dead, these scenes just aren't that thrilling to the movie audience.  After all, we've seen Titanic sink, Barad-Dur fall, King Kong knock down airplanes, and Anthony Michael Hall kiss Uma Thurman - we've seen plenty of miracles already.  Norton does a great job as Eisenheim, but it's difficult not to be reminded that we're merely watching special effects and not a real magician.<br /><br />The love story between Eisenheim and Sophie is touching, but does not reach the heights of a great Hollywood love story by any means.  The Viennese are definitely not the most passionate people in Europe - it's clear why Shakespeare set "Romeo and Juliet" in Italy rather than its chilly neighbor to the north.<br /><br />All in all, "The Illusionist" is a good, solid movie.  If this review comes across as a bit negative, that is only because I had so many people tell me that I "just had" to watch this movie.  I came in with high expectations, and while I can definitely recommend "The Illusionist" as a good movie, I can't say it's one of the must-see movies of the year.</p></body></html>

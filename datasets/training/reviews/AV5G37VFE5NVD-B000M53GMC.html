In my personal opinion, GOLDFINGER is the best of the Bond films and certainly my favorite.  In this witty entry, agent 007 (Sean Connery, for his third appearance) investigates a wealthy millionaire(Gert Frobe), only to unveil a plot to break in to the Fort Knox gold reserve.  Rarely does a film so entertaining and funny as GOLDFINGER come around - of course, this is natural for the Bond movies, but GOLDFINGER surpasses any record previously or later set by the 007 adventures.  It has everything, firmly establishing the Bond formula: explosive beginning ("Shocking"); an attractive female lead (Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore); a stunning main title sequence; plenty of humor thrown in with the action; and, of course, Q-Branch's first comedic performance.  Connery is at his greatest as the British super spy; the film also features great performances from it's entire cast.  The score, by John Barry, is one of the finest of the original few films.  Of course, Guy Hamilton's directing is superb as well.  GOLDFINGER has been firmly established as one of the most entertaining films of our time.<p>END TITLE: Don't miss out on this block of gold!</p></body></html>

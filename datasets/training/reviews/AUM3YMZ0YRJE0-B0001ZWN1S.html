<meta name="summary" content="to be viewed as often as one would wish"></head><body><p>This is one of those films that only gets better each time you see it.  I would estimate I have watched this film 30 times, and each time it is as absorbing in all its detail as the first time - and I just keep seeing more.  Every single actor gives a first rate performance, from the young Diane Keaton - what an extraordinary talent and beauty! - to the worn down Marlon Brando, whose aging shocked my parents.  While this is a kind of pseudo-presidency (or kingship), this is a fundamental study of the wielding of power, the importance of family loyalty, and the brutality of the world.<br /><br />One of the best.  The details matter.  This cannot disappoint.</p></body></html>

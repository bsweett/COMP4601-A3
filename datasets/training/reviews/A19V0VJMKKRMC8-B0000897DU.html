First Of All I Love Rap Music And Eminem Is So Brutally Honest.Good Thing Is He Can Also Act And<br />I Think The Oscars Left Him Out For Best Actor.  The Plot Is Very Realistic For A Rapper Turned Actor Movie. I Could Imagine Everything In Detroit Being Like It Was In This Movie. The Only Thing I Didn't Like  Was The Ending. We Want To Know What Happenned With Jimmy's Life. Otherwise A Truly Great Movie For All To Reflect On.</p></body></html>

It is like one long episode, a continuation of the TV story, and it works very well like that.

(In the first one, Spock sums it up by saying &quot;we may have witnessed the next step in our evolution&quot;.  I mean, sheesh!)  But this one just tells a good yarn.  It is a pity that the others aspired to more than the medium could sustain.</p></body></html>

Portraying the unlikely friendship that develops between a disaffected 70-something Korean War vet and the son and daughter of a Hmong family that lives next door, the movie is a surprisingly affecting and at times even funny story of personal redemption and cultural collision.  With a backdrop of urban decay and gang violence, it also makes for an interesting portrait of the continuing decline of the American city, even if its ultimate focus is more personal.  Much like The Wrestler, another of the past year's best films, Gran Torino provides a look at the kind of people and areas many of us don't see in our daily lives, let alone in movies, and portrays its characters sympathetically without neglecting their flaws.<br /><br />The film is largely carried by Eastwood, whose well-established tough-guy identity gets a new twist in the form of Walt Kowalski, a retired Ford worker who stubbornly clings to his house and his old-school ways in a Detroit neighborhood that's rapidly being taken over by immigrants and a larger world that no longer seems to be his own.  In a way, Walt represents the flip side of Eastwood's iconic characters and persona: he's The Man With No Name turned into a dinosaur, Dirty Harry rendered irrelevant by changing times.  We first see Walt snarling his way through his beloved wife's funeral, angered by the various signs of modernity he sees around him and the lack of respect shown by his descendents.  As the movie goes on we get a better idea of the reaons for Walt's anger: his sons have grown into suburban yuppies with overprivileged brats for children, and his middle-class neighborhood has come to be dominated by minorities, especially Hmong immigrants whom he describes using a variety of disparaging epithets.  This is clearly a guy who's not too familiar with the concept of political correctness and who feels no need to discard the prejudices he's taken for granted his whole adult life.<br /><br />It would be easy, especially at first, to dismiss Walt as a simple crank and bigot, and while that description wouldn't necessarily be inaccurate it wouldn't tell the whole story either.  In his own way, Walt is an idealist, one who believes in certain values--patriotism, self-sacrifice, hard work, proper lawn care--that he believes (rightly or not) aren't shared by his new neighbors.  As we see through a series of conversations with the well-meaning local priest, Walt has fallen victim in his old age to a combination of cynicism, alienation, and racial hatred, born of his harrowing experiences in Korea and a mounting disgruntlement at a world that's relentlessly changing around him.  The film does do a pretty good job (largely through Walt's growled declarations to himself) of allowing the viewer to see the world through the eyes of an aging man who's surrounded by the unfamiliar and having a hard time adjusting to it.  Charged at age 78 with largely carrying the film, Eastwood has the difficult task of turning Walt from a caricature to fully fleshed-out character over the course of two hours, a feat that few others could pull off but that's helped immensely by his natural gravity and his own gritty, stark direction.<br /><br />While Walt may seem like a giant ball of hate at first, he does eventually start to warm up to his teenaged Hmong neighbor Sue (Ahney Her) and later to her brother Thao (Bee Vang), even after Thao tries to steal Walt's prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation.  The bond that gradually emerges between Walt and Thao may be unlikely at first based on Walt's obvious hostility toward other races, but it eventually comes to seem perfectly natural because they're both committed to maintaining their integrity in a world that doesn't seem to have much room for it.  Thao is trying to make his own way in an immigrant society of limited horizons, with few options for the future beyond taking a menial job or joining his cousin's gang, when Walt sees enough potential in him to try to help him overcome the limitations of his surroundings.  Vang has to turn Thao into a real, conflicted person rather than just an idealized symbol of his people, and while he's not as good as Eastwood he still does an admirable job of keeping up with his legendary costar.  Scenes of Walt developing a comfort level with his Hmong neighbors carry an almost sociological fascination, along with the irony of a cranky old racist getting absorbed into the world of Asian immigrants while his relationships with his own family become increasingly strained.<br /><br />Overall, in spite of a few flaws, Gran Torino manages to be a largely excellent movie.  The opening scenes of Walt expressing his seemingly all-consuming bitterness and hatred can get a bit tiresome, and the ending is a little over-the-top and dramatic compared to what preceded it, but there's still more than enough quality material to make this film worth watching.  The slower, more contemplative middle section is actually the most interesting part of the movie, as we see the challenges faced by both the aging Walt and the coming-of-age Thao in their daily lives, as well as the slow, awkward process of Walt letting his guard down enough to become a mentor to Thao.  Those looking for a change of pace from the never-ending stream of remakes and TV and comic-book adaptations coming out of Hollywood could certainly do a lot worse.</p></body></html>

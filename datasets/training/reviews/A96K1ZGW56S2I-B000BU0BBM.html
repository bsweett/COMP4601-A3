The story stars Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as Will and Jacob Grimm, the two scholars of history who traveled throughout Germany gathering the old fairy tales and legends that had been passed down through the generations through storytelling and collected them together in one collection.  Except, the Will and Jacob Grimm in THE BROTHERS GRIMM only resemble the real Brothers Grimm in name only.  In this story, THE BROTHERS GRIMM are a pair of sibling con artists, traveling from town to town fighting and apparently defeating one supernatural being after another, from ghosts to witches and trolls.  When they fight a creature it appears quite remarkable, but that's only because of all the gadgets and stage techniques the duo uses.  The ghouls and goblins are only their stage hands covered in makeup and assisted by lighting, pulleys, springs, and wires.  It makes for a great show and with at least one villager present to witness the event, it brings in a lot of money. The Germans love the Brothers Grimm.<br /><br />However, Germany is under the control of the French and the French aren't as disposed to superstitions, myths, and legends as the locals.  When ten young girls in the village of Marbaden disappear the locals become so frightened that the French fear a revolt.  General Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce) has the brothers arrested and places them under the care of the famed torture artist Cavaldi (Peter Stormare).  Delatombe threatens to give the brothers over to Cavaldi unless they are able to find the missing girls in Marbaden.  Upon their arrival, they hire a local woman, Angelika (Lena Headey) to guide them through the forest.  She does and the brothers begin to realize that maybe there is some truth to fairy tales after all as they come face to face with a man who can transform into a wolf, an evil gingerbread man, and a wicked ageless queen.<br /><br />Though THE BROTHERS GRIMM is a complete work of fiction, in the hands of Terry Gilliam it becomes a masterpiece of fantasy.  As every good storyteller knows, fairy tales have heroes and villains and end happily.  However, fairy tales are also very dark.  They are supposed to be that way because they help us (and especially children) understand a world that is often very cruel and full of pain and suffering.  THE BROTHER GRIMM is a grand fairy tale and in the telling it weaves together elements of many of the real Brothers Grimm's most famous tales: Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, The Gingerbread Man, Rapunzel, etc.<br /><br />I like Terry Gilliam as a director, but his films have been somewhat hit and miss the past few years.  THE BROTHERS GRIMM is one that falls into the hit column.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  The movie was engaging and captivating.  I especially liked how Damon and Ledger played the opposite type of roles they normally play.  I also like discovering the allusions to the various Grimm fairy tales scattered throughout the movie.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Gilliam, people who enjoy fantasy movies, and families who don't mind watching a fairy tale film told the way a fairy tale should be told.<br /><br />The DVD includes a director's commentary with Gilliam, which is worth the time to listen through if you have it.  There are a few deleted scenes, including the most expensive scene in the whole film: Will and Jake and Angelika fighting a giant tree.  There are a couple of behind the scenes featurettes, "Bringing Fairy Tale to Life" and "The Visual Magic of THE BROTHERS GRIMM".</p></body></html>

A hard-boiled detective falls in love with a portrait of a dead woman, and obsesses about finding out more about her.<br /><br />This DVD restoration is amazing for its quality.  As with some other recent restorations, it seems that someone literally went frame by frame and made this luxurious, velvety result that you and I can enjoy.<br /><br />It's wonderful, and the commentaries are very, very interesting as well.  That something of this quality helped our servicemen get through World War II is also incredibly romantic and very, very moving.</p></body></html>

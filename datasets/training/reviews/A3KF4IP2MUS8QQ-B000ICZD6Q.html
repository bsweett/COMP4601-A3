<meta name="summary" content="A refreshingly honest, sincere film many can relate to"></head><body><p>In Good Company is a well-made, entertaining film that reveals the soullessness of our modern "Who Moved My Cheese?" society.  Companies are bought and sold like common chattel, dedicated workers are sacrificed to the cash cow of corporatism, business leaders make hundreds of millions of dollars by uttering meaningless catch phrases and big words while proving themselves quite oblivious to the concept of actually serving their customers (or their employees), and the depersonalization of the business world leads to corporate scandals and broken lives.  In this film, the old school meets the new school; it's not always pretty, but it is entertaining - and educational.<br /><br />Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) has it pretty good; he's got a great wife and two teenaged daughters, he makes a good living doing something he enjoys - overseeing the ad sales for Sports America magazine, and he's happy in his quiet, stable life.  Then, change crashes down upon him in wave upon wave.  He learns that his wife is pregnant (which is the last thing he expected at their age), Sports America is sold to a big conglomerate, he's replaced by some college kid know-it-all, and his eldest daughter wants to transfer to NYU (second mortgage, here we come).  At least he does get to keep his job - he's just reporting to young Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), who has zero years experience compared to his twenty-three years in the position he just lost.  As he watches long-time clients disappear and good employees that he hired lose their jobs, he thinks things can't get much worse - and then he finds out that his daughter is sleeping with his young boss.  One can understand why he gets a little grumpy at times.<br /><br />Carter is an interesting character, and I must say Topher Grace acquits himself quite well in the role.  Initially, he is just annoyingly gung ho about business and his bright and shiny future - in a word, he is one of the mindless zombies inspired by business moguls such as Teddy K (Malcolm McDowell).  It's synergy this, synergy that, teamwork, blah blah blah - we've all heard that new brand of corporate nonsense.  It would be easy to dislike such a character (and Dan certainly does dislike him - at first).  We examine Carter's life in juxtaposition to that of Dan, though, and we see the human being behind the suit.  His wife has left him after seven months, and he's so lonely that he boondoggles Dan into inviting him home for dinner.  There he renews an earlier brief acquaintance with Dan's daughter Alex (Scarlett Johansson), and that lays the foundation for their blooming relationship - which is kept hush hush from Dan, of course.  Dads have a way of finding out their daughters' little secrets, though.<br /><br />It is most interesting to watch the relationship between Dan and Carter develop as the film proceeds.  You may not be able to teach an old dog new tricks, but that doesn't mean that old dog doesn't have a few things to teach the pups, and Carter begins to understand that - just as he begins to see his fellow suits in a new light after Teddy K himself pays the company a visit.  As for Dan, he comes to see the deficiencies in Carter's life, and a weird kind of father-son relationship eventually emerges as Carter begins to change.  The ending is somewhat ambiguous, but so is life itself.<br /><br />This is a very human film on all counts.  It has its funny moments, but I would not really consider this a comedy in the traditional sense.  It's a story about life, an intelligent film that proceeds with a sense of honesty and believability that is rare in movies these days.  It does tend to skewer modern business practices (and rightly so), reinforcing the traditional values that built the great economic engine that today's business fatcats are exploiting for their own personal gain.  I would hope that some of the real-life equivalents of Teddy K would watch this film, but they are all too blinded by their egos to learn anything from it, anyway.</p></body></html>

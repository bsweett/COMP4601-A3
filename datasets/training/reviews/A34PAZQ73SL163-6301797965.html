Young Frankenstein is miles ahead of all but one of Brooks's films.  It's absolutely hilarious even if its not the superlative, Blazing Saddles.  Feldman is the creator of quite a few laughs and I had no idea that Terri Garr was that attractive when she was younger.  Kahn is a riot and Boyle does fine work.  Brooks gives the narrative some cute little twists such as transpires with the little girl by the well.  Without giving anything away, let me say that the ending is excellent and tough to predict.</p></body></html>

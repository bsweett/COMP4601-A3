Will Smith plays his character, Alex Hitchens, brilliantly!  I found myself actually rotting for "Hitch", otherwise known as "The Date Doctor", to help his clients attract the attention, and hopefully love, from their favorite members of the opposite sex.<br /><br />Smith has once again proven his ability as a star on the big screen.  He and his costars, Eva Mendez (Sara), Kevin James (Albert), Amber Valletta (Allegra Cole), and Julie Ann Emery (Casey), worked magic on the screen.  I judge all movies by how well the film grabs me, taking me on a ride that I forget it isn't real life I'm seeing.  Hitch has such great chemistry between the actors and actresses that I actually forgot I was watching a movie and just sat back and enjoyed the interaction between characters.  The director did a good job cutting out some of the scenes originally included in the filming.  Those were the only scenes that didn't quite work.<br /><br />When Will Smith and Kevin James are on screen together, they are hilarious.  The two reminded me of the same on screen chemistry Chris Farley and David Spade used to have on screen.  Now throw in the amazing Eva Mendez and this turns into a film that just can't miss.<br /><br />Hitch tries to help Albert get the woman of his dreams to notice he is even alive.  But Hitch doesn't stop there.  He teaches Albert how to make Allegra Cole not only notice him; he teaches him how to make her fall in love with him.  I won't give away the entire plot.  I'll just say this: If you are looking for a movie that has a little bit of everything in it, especially a script that should bring a smile to your face, you needn't look any further.  This is the movie.<br /><br />See ya next review</p></body></html>

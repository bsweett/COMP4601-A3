<meta name="summary" content="Michelle Pfeiffer owns Halle Berry!!!"></head><body><p>On one of the featurettes on this DVD one of the producers of 2004's Catwoman states "I think everyone will forget all the other Catwomen when they see her (Berry's) portrayal." WRONG! This complete failure of a movie shouldn't even be compared to any of its Batman predecessors, television and film included. For one, Halle Berry's performance is much more inferior than Michelle Pfeiffer's classic Catwoman performance in Batman Returns. Two, this has nothing to do with its Batman origins. Remember how Batman Returns ended? Why couldn't they have done a movie that showed what Catwoman did after Batman Returns? That would've been so much more interesting than just a stupid, horribly executed, weak storylined spin-off-but-not-really-a-spin-off piece of crap.<br />Aside from all that, all the acting in this movie completely sucked, Halle Berry included. The only moderately okay performance was from Sharon Stone, and even that wasn't that great. I couldn't stand all of Catwoman's horribly cheesey one liners, and there were some seriously ridiculous scenes in the movie that just made me laugh at the stupidity of it all. The scene where Patience (Berry) is rubbing the catnip ball all over her nose. I hope to God Halle realized how stupid she really looked when she saw the final cut. That seriously should've been a deleted scene. And the basketball scene. Don't even get me started there. But the most ridiculous scene was where Patience becomes Catwoman. A magical egyptian cat breathes his Cat Powers into her mouth after she was killed? Have all the writers in Hollywood gone retarded? Of course the scene is equipped with some overly dramatic music. Quite hilarious actually.<br />The only thing this movie had going for it was its sleek and fast visual style which was hardly enough to compensate for everything else that just sucked immensely.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Hulk is Back With a Vengeance!!!"></head><body><p>I remember seeing this on Friday the 13th, and buying it while we were traveling to get my dad signed up for his retirement! This version of The Incredible Hulk is a lot better than the 2003 version. It has more elements to the classic t.v. series! The Hulk looks awesome! The fight that the Hulk has with Abomination is pretty sweet! The 2003 version was a lot more military oriented and had a soap opera element between father and son, but this one is just right. It even has a cameo from Tony Stark! I highly recommend THE INCREDIBLE HULK!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE FICKLE FINGER OF FATE..."></head><body><p>This teen scare flick is a cut above most others. Here, it is not some crazed killer which does away with most of the cast but, rather, the fickle finger of fate that selects the next denizen of the great beyond.<br /><br />The movie starts off happily enough with a class of high school seniors about to depart for Paris. Once they board the plane, our main man, Alex, cannot quite overcome his fear of flying, as he has a premonition that the plane is going to blow up upon takeoff.<br /><br />His hysteria is such that he, as well as four other students, is escorted off the plane, accompanied by faculty members, one of whom returns to re-board the plane. No sooner does the plane take off, it blows up in mid air. It seems that fate has snatched these lucky individuals out of death's clutches...or has it?<br /><br />Their relief, at having escaped being blown up on the plane, turns to terror, as it appears that fate will not have them cheat death. The lengths that these young people go to evade fate, and the steps that fate takes to hunt them down one by one, makes for a crafty and clever thriller. Teens and adults alike will enjoy this flick.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Man On Fire" is an excellent movie!"></head><body><p>"Man On Fire" is an excellent movie! It is a remake of the 1987 movie with Scott Glenn as John W. Creasy, a man who accepts a job as a bodyguard to a wealthy family. Denzel Washington plays the same character with the same name as the Scott Glenn character in the original. It also has the same plot as the original. But this remake looks better than the original. The movie runs at nearly 2 1/2 hours long, which is pretty long, but, it is still an excellent movie with style and charisma, thanks to Denzel. His performance is a possible Oscar nomination for Best Actor at next year's Oscars, he is excellent in this performance. Dakota Fanning, stars as Pita Ramos, the daughter of the wealthy family he protects. Her performance is as excellent as Denzel's is. Creasy, at first, resents life, but, then, something unexpected happens. Creasy and Pita strike up a friendship. Then she gets kidnapped and Creasy is shot, trying to protect her. Then the story revolves around him trying to find her, hence the title "Man On Fire". Christopher Walken, stars as Rayburn, Creasy's friend who helps him in his journey of getting Pita back. Tony Scott's directing is excellent and has made a well done movie. The screenplay by Brian Helgeland, based on the novel by A.J. Quinnell, is excellent. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams is excellent. The cinematography by Paul Cameron is excellent. The film editing by Christian Wagner is excellent. The casting by Lucinda Syson, Manuel Teil, & Bonnie Timmermann is excellent. The production design by Benjam&iacute;n Fern&aacute;ndez & Chris Seagers and the costume design by Louise Frogley is excellent. The art direction by Hector C. Romero is excellent. The set decoration by Elli Griff is excellent. This movie is well made and fast paced. It is a emotional and powerful movie. This has to be Denzel's best movie ever. Go see this movie, if you can or if you want to.</p></body></html>

It sees a bunch of animals escape from Central Park Zoo, New York, only to be captured, deported, shipwrecked, and caught up in Lemur/Foosa politics on Madagascar and the instincts of the wild. It felt more like a TV special than a movie, and didn't really have much of an ending. I found the style of jokes kind of tired, just let me down a bit. Special features include some new footage of the penguins, among other things.</p></body></html>

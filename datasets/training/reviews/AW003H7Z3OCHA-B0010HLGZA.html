<meta name="summary" content="A Classic Family &quot;Christmas Story&quot; now on DVD!!"></head><body><p>Author Jean Shepherd's ability to publish his boyhood memoirs and then narrate them flawlessly in this 1983 movie &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is an Annual Holiday treat for the entire family. He captures pre-WWII America still in their humor &amp; innocence with perfection.<p>A must for the family HOLIDAY LIBRARY!!! (even with the FULL SCREEN format, you can pretend that it was before widescreen).<p>Perfectly cast and a most delightful tale on an Indiana family during the Christmas Holidays of 1940. Radio was the evenings entertainment (Little Orphan Annie). And family outings (Christmas tree shopping, the towns Christmas Parade, Departmnet Store shopping and the visit to see, ask Santa for those well deserved toys. (You'll shoot your eye out, kid!)) were the holiday norm.<p>A great movie, one of the best for the entire family to enjoy!!! Pull up a chair, sit down, watch and listen to Jean Shepherds delightful narration of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;.</p></body></html>

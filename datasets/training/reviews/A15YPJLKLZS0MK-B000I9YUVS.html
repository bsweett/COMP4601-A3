<meta name="summary" content="Remake"></head><body><p>This is a remake of the John Carpenter film of the same name. Here Carpenter is the producer. That film just misses being a classic. 100 years ago a ship was purposely sunk, drowning all aboard. Now they're back for revenge. They seek out the descendants of those responsible for their deaths. Overall I was satisified with the original, but not this remake.</p></body></html>

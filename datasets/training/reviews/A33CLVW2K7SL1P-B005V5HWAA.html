<meta name="summary" content="A difficult to believe spider web of contrivances makes this story scattered, unbelievable, and ultimately dull"></head><body><p>I'm baffled at the four star rating this movie has here on Amazon, and find myself more in agreement with the scores on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, 45/100 and 55/100 respectively. The script felt loose, cluttered, and unorganized. Not quite a first draft, but not polished enough for a final. In writing, whether it's a script, a short story, an essay, a novel, or a simple Freshman Comp assignment, first, second, and third drafts often contain unrealistic or extraneous information that eventually is weeded out by good, solid editing. This script obviously lacked good, solid editing. Or, at best, perhaps too many hands were in the pie.<br /><br />We had one story line - Mr. Brooks, an acknowledged addict of murdering people, and the battle with his inner demon. Very typical of the very old bit where a devil sits on one shoulder egging the person on to do horrible or dishonest things, and an angel on the other trying its always futile best to dissuade. The battle itself wasn't interesting, because it didn't introduce anything new, and Costner simply wasn't the right actor this role. He's not an "actor's actor", someone who can comfortably fit into many different roles. He's more like Brad Pitt, an actor who can shine in certain films, and stink up others to the point of nausea. Costner was terrific in Bull Durham and Tin Cup, not so good in Wyatt Earp, JFK, or Robin Hood. William Hurt, an excellent actor with terrific range (see Kiss of the Spider Woman) didn't do much with what he was given, although to be fair, he wasn't given much. Make no mistake: watching Hurt and Costner duel wasn't like watching Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino (now THAT would be interesting...perhaps even with bad material).<br /><br />This story line should have been enough. But it wasn't. There was the addition of female cop, Demi Moore, who was worth $60+ million dollars, but because she wanted to prove to her father that she was as good as any boy, was a cop. This was supposed to create some interesting tension between Costner's character and Moore's, at least on Costner's side, but didn't. There was also *another* serial killer who had just escaped, one who vowed to get back at Moore.<br /><br />In addition, there's a photographer who liked to watch a certain couple "get it on", who was watching when Mr. Brooks killed the couple, and he too wants to become a serial killer.<br /><br />But wait! There's more. I won't say who (even though it's not much of a surprise)...but we have FOUR serial killers, or would-be serial killers, in one movie.<br /><br />I'm a believer in listening to stories. Only give a story what it needs. Nothing more, nothing less. And every element needs to be absolutely believable. If one story line in a story isn't cutting it, if it doesn't make sense, or doesn't have enough to make it stand on its own, then it needs to either take a hike, or have something else removed so that it receives the attention it deserves.<br /><br />That's what I felt happened here. There was too much going on, and most of it was unnecessary and unbelievable. Perhaps if the story focused only on Mr. Brooks himself, and the specific struggle he had, there could have been a good story. The story did not, however, and it suffered. Mightily.</p></body></html>

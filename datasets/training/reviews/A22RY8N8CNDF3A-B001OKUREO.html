<meta name="summary" content="Josh Brolin Does Great -"></head><body><p>Josh Brolin plays a fascinating George W. Bush and Richard Dreyfus is Dick Cheney.  The movie shows Bush''s life from Yale cheerleader to the 43rd President of the United States.  He leads an amazing life with huge events that he has to face and deal with, sibling and paternal rivalry, his struggle with alcohol, finding faith and his wife, as well as the days leading up to the Iraq War.<br /><br />It is always difficult to distill anyone's entire life into a two and a half hour film, especially a controversial President.<br /><br />The movie starts in 1966 showing George W. Bush at a Yale initiation pledge.  The story of his early life continues showing his drinking problem and wild ways.  In 1977 he announces at a poker party he is running for Congress in Texas, but loses the election.  When he turns 40 Bush becomes a born again Christian, gives up alcohol and becomes closer with his father who asks him to help with his presidential campaign.  He says he will do it but feels slighted that Jeb is running for Governor of Florida.  He felt his father only asked him because he was available to help out.<br /><br />Eventually Bush runs and wins his campaign for Governor of Texas.  After some thought, he feels God wants him to run for President and wins.<br /><br />The director, Oliver Stone, in large part created a fascinating character study and the supporting actors do their jobs well.  W is hard to forget, a "good ole boy" who had a lot handed to him, but also heavy burdens and hard decisions he felt God wanted him alone to have.<br /><br />Overall a fascinating story.</p></body></html>

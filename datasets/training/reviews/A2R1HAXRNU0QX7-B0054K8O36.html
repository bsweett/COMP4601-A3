PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES is a huge disappointment.  It will make lots of money and spawn more sequels...but the spark has gone out, and frankly, I'm not sure anything will help.  As long as Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is the major character, these films just aren't going to cut it.<br /><br />Think back on the first film in the series POTC: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (goodness, typing all these long titles is tedious).  It starred two lovely up-and-coming performers at the height of their popularity (Keira Knightley and especially Legolas...oh, I mean Orlando Bloom).  And Johnny Depp was there too...a popular, slightly hip actor.  And the film featured state of the art effects, some juicy supporting performances (especially from always reliable Geoffrey Rush) and was a burst of fresh air.  A lush pirate adventure that was actually fun!  Knightley and Bloom were lovely to look at and feisty and witty.  And Depp was a revelation.  His Sparrow was a unique and amazing creation.  (I won't run down all his now very familiar characteristics.)  So much so that Depp was nominated for an Oscar and went from modestly successful leading man to full blown STAR.  The world was drowned in Depp and we embraced his oddball characterizations.  He went on to receive another Oscar nomination for FINDING NEVERLAND and to considerable oddball success in more and more Tim Burton films.<br /><br />Meanwhile, POTC: DEAD MAN'S CHEST arrived.  Packed even more full of effects, it still had lots of fun...but suffered from sequel-bloat.  More was not always more.  But I still found it quite enjoyable, with some stunt work that was fun (the big "hamster ball" scene is still clever).  Depp was now solidly the star, but Sparrow was still new enough that we wanted more.  But by the time POTC: AT WORLD'S END came along, the film was SO special effects laden, SO loud and SO Jack Sparrow centric that I felt the series was pretty much played out.  The movie was long and frequently boring.  Big CGI battle scenes were not enough to engage.  The characters were so familiar.  There was nothing new that Jack Sparrow could bring to the table.  His strange accent, odd mincing and fake-drunk demeanor were totally familiar.  But of course, we viewers attended dutifully and saw the series wrapped up.  The Knightley / Bloom characters had their arc more or less wrapped up (and by now, Bloom was not even remotely a movie star any more).  It was a disappointing end to a series that started so well...but it really did seem to be the end.<br /><br />Now a new director and a producer Jerry Bruckheimer and star Depp have "rebooted" the series.  And in some ways, they have listened to the criticisms of the past.  The special effects, while still impressive, are significantly dialed down.  There has been an effort to return to character and not just noise for the sake of it.  And aside from Depp & Rush, they've pretty much abandoned all the previous characters.  But Sparrow is still very much the focus, and with stripping away most other distractions, it was painfully clear to me that Sparrow has nothing left to offer us.  There is NO surprise left in this character.  Depp tries hard...but he's not really acting any more, he's recreating mannerisms that once grew organically from Depp the actor.  He's become Depp the Jack Sparrow impersonator.  He can put on the makeup and costume...but not really anything more than a characterization.  Sparrow is a cartoon now.<br /><br />The movie still features some clever "chase" scenes, including an early scene involving horses and carriages that feels like something Jackie Chan might have staged.  But there's lots of talking in the first half of the film.  Lots of exposition.  Something to do with finding the fountain of youth, and who has stolen whose ship and why is the pirate Barbossa now the captain of an English military vessel.  And who is this woman (Penelope Cruise) with a complicated past history with Depp?  They were clearly lovers once, but are now bitter rivals.  But that romantic spark remains.  (Yet Cruz and Depp have no chemistry.  Really, when was the last time Johnny Depp had any real romantic chemistry with an actress?)  And then it turns out she's working with the evil pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane)...the most evil pirate ever.  I found the first hour of this two hour fifteen minute film to be mostly quite tedious, and my eyelids frequently drooped.)<br /><br />Things perked up a bit when Blackbeard and his crew reach the mysterious island where mermaids live.  These mermaids are gorgeous sirens who lure men to them and then turn into some fairly vicious, fanged creatures.  The scene when Blackbeard is trying to trap one of these creatures is actually pretty impressive, and my interest in the film finally rose above lukewarm.  But that interest waned fairly soon.  And when Depp and Rush teamed up towards the end, I realized that the same "been there, seen that" feeling I had about Sparrow also applied to Rush's Barbossa.  Rush brings his best efforts, but the character is what it is...and so he's grown tiresome too.<br /><br />As always, the films are technically impeccable.  (I'd advise saving your money and passing on the 3D version.  That's what I saw, and the 3D added nothing to the film except unneeded darkness.)  But with a needlessly complicated plot, awkward exposition and a lead character who has evolved from surprisingly delightful to dishearteningly mundane...the PIRATES series has worn out its welcome.</p></body></html>

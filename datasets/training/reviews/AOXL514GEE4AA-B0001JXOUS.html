<meta name="summary" content=""Warriors, willing to give their lives for what seems to have become a forgotten word: honor." Blu ray review"></head><body><p>Set in Japan during the 1870s, Tom Cruise plays Capt. Nathan Algren, an American military leader hired to train Japan's army in modern warfare. He is a drunk mercenary tortured by his inner demons. In his first encounter against the Samurai, Algren is captured by Katsumoto, played brilliantly by Ken Watanabe. He quickly is impressed by the Samurai's skills in battle and unexpectedly drawn to their way of life while in captivity. Ultimately, he finds himself at Katsumoto's side, driven by his sense of honor.<br /><br />This is a great film and probably Tom Cruise's best. It is beautifully written and acted. It is also loaded with brilliant cinematography and amazing battle choreography. An epic and worth mentioning with such great films like Gladiator and Braveheart! A must own for any collector.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: A very nice transfer that enhances all the beauty of Japan's landscape. The audio is slightly lacking but better than the previous dvd release. All the special features are carried over. FINAL VERDICT: IT WOULD BE DISHONORABLE NOT TO UPGRADE! A MUST OWN!</p></body></html>

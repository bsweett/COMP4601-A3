After throwing a knife at a man which sticks him to the wall, he says: "stick around.."!!!!!!!! Hilarious!!!! His moaning when he is hurt and "he can't see me..." and "GO TO DA CHOPPERRRRRRRR!!" makes it hilarious. But without Ahnold's stupid humor, there's actually a good classic movie here. The story centers around a group of soldiers that have dissapeared. Arnold and his group of elite soldiers must then go to the jungle to find out what happen. But soon, they realize that their enemy isn't human. Of course, you already know what's going to happen, that everyone's going to die besides Arnold. So that's not giving away anything... But, some great action scenes, the creation of a new, original, classic, and awesome vilain, and some cheesy one liners by the governator make this one a great movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well, At Least The Ending Isn't A Dream!"></head><body><p>Telly (Julianne Moore) and Ash (Dominic West) play two separate parents (previously unknown to eachother) who find that they both lost their young children in a plane crash on the way to a summer camp.  The problem is they keep "losing" their memories or worst, clear possessions of their child they know they once had.  It feels like their memory of their lost child is being `erased' from them or that they might be going crazy.  That's lots of fun to watch.  Of course, the spouses are trying their best to deal with this annoying craziness, but there is only so much a person can do!  Director Joseph Ruben inserts lots of mind-bending special effects and after an hour you wonder what in the heck is going on here?  Suffice it to say that if you ever saw a movie where it turns out everything was really a dream, you know how ripped off you felt.  Well, the ending here is no less interesting and as much of a letdown.  Think of a bad television version of the "X-Files"!</p></body></html>

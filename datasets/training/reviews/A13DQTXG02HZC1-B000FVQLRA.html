It is a personal movie for Roman Polanski as much as "Schindler's List" to Steven Spielberg.  It's not for me to say that which one is better than another because I don't believe a comparison is needed.  Rather, I would rather treat them as two different entities.  Whilst their cores are different, one depicting how one soul is saved by reluctantly saving countless of lives, the other is about surviving the hardship during the occupation of Poland during World War 2, both of them attempted to convey  the potential evils that we humans could become.  From this movie, I learnt of the ghettos, the walls that separated the Jews from the others not unlike the Berlin Wall, the kinds of humiliations & indignities that Jews needed to live through during those oppressive periods.  I also learnt that there was a disunity among Jews during that time.  Some were Germans lackeys & some totally opposed to them.  There were many poignant moments.  Out of those hard time, we were also shown the generosity & compassion that came from people from all walks of life & race (including a high up German officer) to assist Brody's character despite the danger that they might brought to themselves.  The movie never rushed & it gradually revealed itself like a great story book.  We rejoiced & elated for the survivors when the world was all over.  It's about triumph of human spirits.  I guess if we believe much in ourselves, we shall conquer all adversities.  This movie is just the right reminder for us all.  A beautiful movie that's "enjoyable" to watch.  Highly recommended.  In terms of technical information, the DVD set comprises of two CDs, one a feature movie & the other, a documentary depicting how the movie is made.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

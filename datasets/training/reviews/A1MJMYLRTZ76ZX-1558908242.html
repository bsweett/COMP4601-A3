<meta name="summary" content="A few brief comments"></head><body><p>As this movie already has hundreds of reviews (many by much more knowledgable movie fans than I) I just had a few brief comments on this film, mostly related to a particular aspect of the movie that I liked that I hadn't seen discussed yet.<br /><br />Probably Tarantino's best or at least well-known film, the movie is filled with ironic twists of fate or perhaps ironic juxtapositions (I'm not sure what else to call it). For example, the two main characters (played by Samuel Jackson and John Travolta) are a couple of amiable hit-men who are perfectly friendly and civilized as long as you're not on their little list of people to eliminate, as they go around cheerfully discussing philosophy, sex, and the meaning of life while offing their boss's enemies. But Travolta himself comes to an untimely demise after sitting on the pot after leaving his gun in the kitchen when Bruce Willis goes back to retrieve his father's watch. The watch makes an interesting symbol, because neither Travolta nor Willis has time to lose messing around with, in Travolta's case, nature's call, or in Willis's case, sentimental keepsakes. Marcellus Wallace, their employer, is busy trying to screw the boxing fans by fixing fights, but he in turns gets, well, the same treatment from the two B & D types in the store. Not to mention what happens to Wallace when Willis in his car meets up with Wallace in the crosswalk, and the fact that Willis double-crosses Wallace by refusing to throw the fight, thereby double-crossing the double-crosser. And so on and so on. I enjoyed this clever and funny aspect of the movie and it probably remains my favorite among Tarantino's films. Plus Harvey Keitel is great as the guy who can fix even the worst of Travolta and Jackson's screw-ups and misadventures.</p></body></html>

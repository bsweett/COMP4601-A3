He should do cartoons, because he was a perfect match.  The penguins MAKE this movie, along with Melman (David Schwimmer) and Julius the Lemur King (Sacha Baron Cohan)!  First off I just want to say that critics are not always right, and this is proof of that.  You begin to realize that critics get stuck in a mold.  They don't like more than a handful of elements for a movie and feel that anything that breaks that mold is just not good.  Thats why I hardly ever listen to them, and for one, I am glad I went to see this.  There was actually a scene where I laughed so hard I was crying.  Just wait until our four legged friends meet the Lemurs.  THE BEST SCENE EVER!  So the movie starts with Marty the Zebra (Rock) turning 10 years old and he's wishing he was in the wild.  Alex the Lion (Stiller) is his best friend (a little self centered, which I fould hilarious because I took my eight year old nephew to this movie and his name is Alex and he is EXTREMLY self centered!) and Alex is trying to convince Marty the wild is bad...I mean come on, what can be better than the NY zoo (which by the way looks really small in this movie)  In the meantime Marty meets the penguins (McGrath) who are planning to escape and make their way to Antarctica.  So Marty breaks out that night and tries to make it to CT, since that's where Melman tells him the wild is (it's funny trust me) and that's where his friends Gloria (Pinket-Smith), Melman and of course Alex try and find him.  In an effort to do so they all (penguins included) end up on a ship to Kenya.  The penguins aren't having that so they kidnap the captain and turn the ship around towards Antarctica.  In the process Marty, Alex, Melman and Gloria are tossed overboard and washed up on Madagascar.  The rest of the movie is pretty much Marty trying to make the best of things and Alex trying to get rescued, the other two are pretty much just along for the ride...But the greatest part of the plot here revolves around the Lemurs.  See there is some weird kind of cat called the Foosca that are feeding on the Lemurs and the King of the Lemurs Julius decides that they must befriend Alex the Lion so he can protect them from the Foosca, all of this against the will of his advisor played by Cedric the Entertainer.  The rest of this movie is priceless and one of the best scenes involves the Penguins making it to Antarctica.  "This sucks"...it's great...just wait, you'll love it.  So my recomendation is watch this movie.  It's better than Shark Tale, more livly than The Incredibles and just as, if not funnier than Shrek...You'll love it!</p></body></html>

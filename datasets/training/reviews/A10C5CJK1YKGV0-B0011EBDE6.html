<meta name="summary" content="World ... this is the Shark, I just jumped the people tank ..."></head><body><p>Technique #01:<br /><br />Edward Hopper lighting and mood meets Winslow Homer film paintings -- some times in slow motion, sometimes weaving through the frame with a small amount of tracking. Wow, Wes Anderson is bloody genius, man!<br /><br />I guess Wes Anderson believes in his heart of hearts that repeating different aspects of the same tale about a family of dysfunctional self-absorbed, trust-funding Manhattan-ite Billionaires is remotely interesting at least to some people. He's bold for believing so, but foolish for not fleshing out his work a little better and trying to draw us in closer.<br /><br />Maybe the story started with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428239">Rushmore</a>, then went to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000640VJ">The Royal Tenenbaums</a> and then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNLQ">The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</a> and now (hopefully) ending full-circle now with The Darjeeling Limited. I say ending, because any more of this might begin to reflect on the previous films and detract from them over time by association. Like when Star Wars geeks say stuff like: "I like the even numbered films but not the odd numbered ones." No, they all suck, buddy. You see how five other films dragged down <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQJAJG">The Empire Strikes Back</a> into forgettable obscurity?<br /><br />Technique #02:<br /><br />I love Film Noir, depression as a main theme and even suicide, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305882592">Harold and Maude</a> being one of my favourite films, but this film just misses the mark on all counts. I really got the feeling that Jason Schwartzman and Wes Anderson were sitting on a bag of cocaine the size of Kirsten Dunst and came up with the bulk of the ideas and dialogue for this project. Even the opening segment, which was optional viewing came across as nothing more than self-indulgent film-making at its worst.<br /><br />Jason Schwartzman is a dynamic actor who basically just hangs around in this film giving it the only energy that's visible and seems to move it along all by himself and his own force of will. My will to continue watching continually faded, without a doubt, but I did stick with it.<br /><br />"He's a genius! You need your art spoonfed to ya!" ... the fanboys scream in the background.<br /><br />Yeah, well, we've seen this all before though haven't we? I find it interesting that no one seems to hold Wes Anderson to any type of benchmark or standard and then just knee-jerk reacts every time he makes a film. While the Life Aquatic was the highpoint of his career thus far, this might serve as a forgettable low-point that the fan boys will all worship, as they hold aloft their boutique made blown-glass mutli-coloured bongs in unison and cry out:<br /><br />"Wes Anderson is a Golden God!!"<br /><br />I think the same people that worship at the alter of Wes Anderson are also the same group of film hypocrites that expect every movie M. Knight makes to be "better" and more surprising at the end than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004BZIY">The Sixth Sense</a>.<br /><br />"O happy masses ... this is thy cliff!"</p></body></html>

ZWICK'S ENORMOUSLY BRILLIANT UNDERTAKING OF AN EPIC AND INSTANT CLASSIC, UNFOLDS IN SUCH SEAMLESS, BEAUTIFUL FASHION, THE 2 1/2 HOURS RUNNING TIME SEEMS ALL TO SHORT!  TOM CRUISE, KEN WATANABE, TONY GOLDWYN, AND ALL THE GREAT CAST PLAY THEIE PARTS WITH SUCH EASE AS WELL AS BRILLIANCE, THAT EXCEPT FOR LORD OF THE RINGS RETURN OF THE KING, THIS FILM WOULD/SHOULD IN FACT WALKED AWAY WITH THE OSCARS! THE FINAL, SPECTACULAR BATTLE SEQUENCE IS AMONGST THE FINEST EVER FILMED-DEEPLY MOVING AND HEROIC AS WELL. THE DVD TRANSFER IS MAGNIFICENT AS IS THE AUDIO-1 COMPLAINT THOUGH-WARNER BROTHERS DVD GET WITH THE PROGRAM ALREADY, OK??  WHY NO DTS ON ONE OF YOUR MOST PRESTIGIOUS FILMS OF THE YEAR?  CMON, WB I EXPECT MORE FROM WB PROBABLY THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY OUT THERE BUT THEY ARE TRULY BEHIND IN AUDIO AS FAR AS USING THE DTS FORMAT!  THAT'S MY ONLY COMPLAINT WITH AN OTHERWISE MAGNIFICENT DVD OF A REMARKABLE FILM.  DISC 2 IS JAMMED PACK WITH SO MANY GOOD EXTRAS, I'VE NOT HAD THE TIME TO VIEW ALL OF IT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE MOVIE OVER AND OVER!  BRAVOS TO ALL INVOLVED.</p></body></html>

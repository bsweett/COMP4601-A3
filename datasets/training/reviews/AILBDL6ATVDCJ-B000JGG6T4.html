<meta name="summary" content="Denzel Does It Again"></head><body><p>Denzel plays a man with a very checkered past. He has resorted to drinking to try an wash his memory clean. It doesn't help, and he seems on a downward spiral. But when he accepts a job as a bodyguard for a nine-year-old girl, a little bit of light begins to shine in his life. Of course it doesn't last long. Kidnappers are determined to us the girl to gain a ransom.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is a fantastic actor, and in this movie he once again proves how good he is.  This was a tough role to play. He had to do a lot of non-speaking acting in this one - often portraying anguish, edge-of-happiness, and genuine fear of where he may be heading in his life, over and over again.  He pulled it off every time.<br /><br />I enjoyed the entire cast in this movie, and I believe Brian Helgeland did an excellent job on the screenplay.  The film flows really well, reminding me of a documentary - director Tony Scott is amazing at what he does.<br /><br />I have heard some critics say this movie is too violent.  I say no way!  Heck, it had Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken as cast members, and they never killed anyone - that's a non-violent film for those guys!<br /><br />Dakota Fanning performs magnificently as the girl Denzel's character is asked to protect.  She has a great future in Hollywood - of this I'm sure.<br /><br />All in all, this movie delivers what any good movie should - a good plot, excellent acting, great visuals and one-liners, and characters you begin to care about.<br /><br />Get this movie!  You'll enjoy it.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></body></html>

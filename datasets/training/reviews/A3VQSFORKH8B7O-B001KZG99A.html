<meta name="summary" content="FINALLY, MARVEL DELIVERS A TERRIFIC SUPERHERO FILM! (Some Spoilers)"></head><body><p>After sitting through some rather lackluster Marvel adaptations, such as the overrated "Spider-man" and "X-Men" films, I sat to watch "Iron Man" with cautious optimism. And it proved to be worthwhile. This is, without a doubt, the best adaptation of a Marvel comic book character to date. Dispensing with over-serious storylines, such as in "Spider-man 2" and "The Hulk," the story never takes itself too seriously, bringing the fun and excitement back to the superhero movie. The storytelling, visual effects and action sequence all deliver.<br />And the performances? What can I say? Robert Downey, Jr. is perfectly cast as Tony Stark, the playboy/weapons seller turned superhero. His performance is truly believable and clever, and gives this superhero movie its heart. The supporting cast, including Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges, plus a cameo appearance by Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, add to the film's richness. After what seemed like an eternity, a Marvel superhero film truly delivers! If you enjoy superhero films, then "Iron Man" will blow you away!<br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+</p></body></html>

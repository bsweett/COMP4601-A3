<meta name="summary" content="Ahead of it's time, Excellent Kubrick Film"></head><body><p>First off, this was not an easy bood to make into a movie, but Stanly Kubrick did an excellent job of doing so, not cutting out too many of the details either.  This movie was way ahead of it's time, with excellent cinemetography, great acting, and excellent adaptation to script of a book that tells a tale of young Alex and his gang in a world he live raise "ultraviolence".  A nice glimpse into the mind of an Antisocial.  Rent this, Buy this, worth owning.  One of the many of a series of Excellent Kubrick films of the 70's.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Like AI in concept, but with more action"></head><body><p>I critized movies such as Spiderman and Star Wars for having SFX that were too perfect, too shiny, making them look unreal. Minority report does not fall into this category. In fact the SFX in this movie is so good, people were amazed with what they saw on the screen. Of course, these are the same audiences that would like to see these SFX in action, rather in servitude to the movie plot and concept.<br /><br />In Washington DC, circa 2054, murder is wiped out because of a special division called the pre-crime unit that uses "pre-cogs" to see murders between 30 minutes to 4 days before they happen. It is a criminal experiment that is straight out of Orwells paranoid 1984, but it is successful enough to warrant a nationwide program. The head of the DC division is Director Burgess (Max Von Sydow) and it is led on the street by Detective John Anderton (Cruise). Anderton, (who falls under 2 standard movie rules 1. Ambition comes from personal tragedy and 2. Cannot have a girlfriend or wife because there is a possibility that he will get back together with an ex.) is possibly framed for the future murder of a person who he has never met and for most of the middle portion, he set out to prove his innocence. He is hunted by a Detective Ed Witwer, a DOJ investigator who has come to audit the program and becomes involved in this developing criminal case, as well as the members of his squad, led by Officer Fletcher (Neal McDonough). As he investigates the case further, he uncovers a conspiracy that may unravel the whole program.<br /><br />The movie is was filmed in the same washed out colors that he and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski used in the battle scene from Saving Private Ryan and parts of AI. It is an indicator that the future will be bleak and disparate, not surprising, since it was written by pessimist Philip Dick (Blade Runner) as a short story long ago. However, this type of estoteric sci-fi, which tackles current issues such as privacy and sacrificing people for the good of society is handled well by Spielberg and his screenwriters. The premise of the movie itself is fascinating, even though it is highly unlikely, but can be slow at moments. A few people walked out of the movie mid way through, probably because they were expecting MIB II. There was lots of visual eye candy that served the story and the plot, but it was not overly done and the things that appear on the screen looked so vivid, that it looked real. One example is Tom's magnetic car which pulls up to his home, the hover transport that drops the troops into location and the cops in backpack jet packs. Spielberg's commitment to detail should be commended.<br /><br />I did not like the ending of this movie that much. You knew that Cruise would get back together with his wife, you knew who was behind the crime. The whole scene involving Sydow's setup was a little too perfect for me. I was also sorting of hoping that Tom and Agatha would hook up instead.<br /><br />There is also a abundance of product placement, from USA Today, to Lexus to the Gap. Even scarier is the concept of "personalized advertising" and the fact that there are eye scanners everywhere.<br /><br />The acting was good overall. Stand outs were Colin Farrell as the worth adversary, Samantha Morton as Agatha, the shivering pre-cog and Cruise, who gets the thankless role of being the straight man. Max Von Sydow, who blew away years ago in the Exorcist and The Seventh Seal plays the role in which he is becoming typecast in. I won't reveal it, but if you watch alot of his movies, you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />There were consistencies I didn't like. One major one was Tom's eyes. How come they didn't change the retina codes to block out his eyes? How come he didn't go blind when he took off his bandages 6 hours early? Why didn't Anderton prove his innocence by not committing the murder? What was the purpose of setting Anderton up? How come the pre-cog couldn't figure out the murder of Anne Lively?<br /><br />These inconsistencies do not take away from the sheer entertainment value of this movie, both as a Summer blockbuster DVD as well as a thought provoking film about where our society is possibly heading....Rating: B</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A terrifying and errily familiar look into the creative process"></head><body><p>Natalie Portman is compelling as a ballerina who finally comes into her own in winning the principal role in her company's production of the famous ballet "Swan Lake."  Even so, the director has his doubts regarding her suitability for this role, as the virginal and narrowly-focused perfectionist played by Portman (who even lives with her controlling mother) seems unable to "loose herself in the role."  Although she seems perfect for the "White Swan" half of the role, she lacks the sensuality and seductive powers of the "Dark Swan" that she must also play.  Enter Mila Kunis, who plays the spontaneous and worldly understudy who befriends Portman's sheltered character and eventually acts as kind of muse for the freshly-minted prima ballerina.<br /><br />As Portman's troubled ballerina struggles to find the artistic voice she needs in order to succeed in this challenging role, she is driven to the brink of insanity.  It is through this painful journey, however, that she is able to open herself to a series of creative epiphanies.  The viewer who has had to stretch and reach in a creative endeavor can identify with her plight--and with the self-doubts and distorted view of reality that come with such anxious quests for perfection, achievement, and enlightenment!  This sort of maddening creative challenge while under the control of an exacting taskmaster should be familiar to anybody who has had to write a graduate thesis!</p></body></html>

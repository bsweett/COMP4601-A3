<meta name="summary" content="The best and most creative musical I've seen"></head><body><p>I didn't expect much from Richard Gere or Renee Zellweger going into this movie, but they really all did such fantastic jobs. It's no wonder that it has been nominated for 13 Academy Awards. This was truly the most classy and fun movie of the year. I didn't see a more unique one at all from 2002. I have never seen a movie done like Chicago before. Musical sequences are intertwined with reality sequences that truly make Chicago a very memorable movie. It is very risque for a PG-13 movie though, and there are a few cuss words, so you might want to think before taking the kids. Other than that though, Chicago was phenominal.</p></body></html>

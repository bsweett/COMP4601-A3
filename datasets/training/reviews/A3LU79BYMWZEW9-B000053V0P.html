I mean, I always figured I'd get around to this film at some point, so I'm not a TOTAL cinema snob and distainer of all things commercial. Those clips of the White House getting zapped were pretty attention grabbing back when I first saw the previews back in the day.  Or just seeing those megalith space ships hovering over every major city in the world was pretty darn ominous.  So deep down, I always wanted to check it out.  But I guess I just was never in that much of a rush to.<br /><br />Now critical analysis is sorta my game, and as the Amazon reviewer notes above, INDEPENDENCE DAY is mostly a pure fun movie--and not one many people are going to subject to intense critical scrutiny.  So why bother to review it all? At this point, it's available in so many different formats that probably all most consumers want to know is which is the right one for them and for their player. They already know whether they want to purchase it or not.  Reviewing the film as film may be virtually pointless when most consumers likely only are looking for a product review at this point.<br /><br />Well, what can I say? I'm a critical analysis kind of guy, so I really can't tell you about the merits of the Digipak over the double or single disk anniversary versions.  To tell you the truth, I watched the thing on plain ol' VHS--that I picked up on sale, no less.  But I still liked it, even without all the DVD bells and whistles.  And, yes, the visuals were stunning even in this antiquated format.<br /><br />But just an apercu or two.  Watching any film in which iconic American buildings get zapped from the sky is no longer the innocent escapism it was in 1995.  I even winced at seeing the twin towers standing tall (and unharmed) in some of the early, pre-catastrophe scenes.  We watch such things with more of a jaded eye these days.  Or is it more of a horrified stare?<br /><br />Escapist fare is usually centered around a big "What If."  These days, we pretty much KNOW "what if."<br /><br />Before seeing this movie, I had always wondered how well Bill Pullman (an actor I genuinely like) would pull off being presidential.  Was he a little TOO young? A little too callow? Cleverly enough, the screenwriters have made him a struggling, almost failing Commander In Chief, whose prior life as a hero pilot in the first Gulf War may have gotten him electec but left him ill prepared for hardball politics.  He's presidential in that youthful John F. Kennedy/Bill Clinton kind of way.  Unlike them, however, he's not much of political pro at all.  But also unlike Kennedy, he's still young and able enough to enter into actual battle once again himself--and  (many would opine)unlike Clinton, he has the guts to do so.<br /><br />And that's something blockbuster films like to play on, isn't it--our almost innate, primitive desire to have our leaders be actual heroes?  Of course, we're just (post-)modern enough to want those heroes a little bit flawed, to say nothing of a bit conflicted.  Pullman is all that and more.  But there is never any doubt that he won't pull off his counter-offensive.  He's got that cute and newly motherless little tyke (the one who later showed up on CHICAGO HOPE) to take care of, so he cannot allow himself to fail.<br /><br />And neither can the crazy crop-dusting pilot Randy Quaid, whose very family has pretty much written him off as a loco loser.  Somehow Quaid is able to inject some humanity and some wit into his stock loser-who's-gonna-show-'em role.  But still, there are times when you find yourself mouthing his lines along with him and wondering just how he pulled this off with a straight face.<br /><br />Which you could also say about the rest of the cast as well.  These mostly very good, widely respected actors have their work cut out for them if they want to move their characters at all beyond the level of the stereotype.  Funny thing is, most of them do.  Mary McDonnell suffers and dies admirably.  Margaret Colin is stunning and sassy as a Presidential Aide.  Her performance is good enough that you have to wonder why she never became "Then Next Big Thing" after all, and I say this with utter conviction, even though I must admit that at the same time, I still keep mixing her up with Elizabeth Perkins.<br /><br />And in the face of almost certain annihilation, she decides to put aside her feud with (still devoted) ex-hubby Jeff Goldblum.  Good thing too, since it is Goldblum's character who has figured out the alien invaders weak spot.  Now all he needs is the ear of the president...But how? But how?  Wait a minute, I know...!<br /><br />Ok, so it's a bit cliched.  But in a tongue in cheek way, you understand.  The beauty of latter-day Sci-fi flicks is that their dazzling special effects are so overwhelming that you really don't want to be bothered with much else.  INDEPENDENCE DAY, like so many other S-F films, wants to come across as 50s flick with killer effects AND enough of a sly self-awareness so as not to appear hopelessly cornball.<br /><br />And yeah, it's just cornball enough.  And yeah, danged if it doesn't all work somehow.</p></body></html>

As isolated dreary Sleepy Hollow, the town that surrounds him, is as strange & secretive as Ichabod & the Headless Horseman himself.<br /><br />Good to great performances abound, as one after the other important townsmen gets their heads lopped off in high fashion. Christopher Walken puts in one of his patented weirdo performances as the Headless Horseman! Short, sweet, & vicious! God love him!<br /><br />The script is fine for the chewing. The direction, darkly, bleakly, comedic, as the gorgeous dark cinematography graces your eyes glowing from the screen. A rich tapestry of dark hues & shades, contrasted by vividly bright hues, all in the right places, enhancing the viewing experience.<br /><br />A great film for Halloween, or any dreary grey day or stormy night. "Sleepy Hollow" will charm you, thrill you, & make you laugh!<br /><br />Heads up!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the most impressive intellectual thrillers in years"></head><body><p>Robin Williams gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the lonely, somewhat creepy, but wholly sympathetic Sy Parrish in this haunting, compelling directorial debut by Mark Romanek.  Some have called this a scary movie, but One Hour Photo works on emotional levels much deeper than fear and disquiet.  This is an intellectual thriller that at times borders on a work of art, a carefully constructed exploration of the depths to which loneliness and bland ordinariness can drive a man.  Everyone reacts to this movie differently; by design, a sense of moral ambiguity pervades the story and its presentation.  Many may see Sy Parrish as a bad guy (though certainly not a stereotypical one); those lucky enough to never know the hopelessness and loneliness this man endures or to experience the devastation of seeing your whole world pulled out from under your feet may look down their noses at him with denigration, not truly understanding his afflictions.  Most of us, though, know what utter loneliness feels like to some degree, and I can't help but believe that most viewers will feel a connection to Sy Parrish that differs markedly from what they might anticipate going in.  If you ask me, there is a bad guy in this film, but it is not Sy Parrish.<br /><br />Sy Parrish's job means everything to him; as a photo developer at a large retail store, he develops customers' pictures with great care and professionalism.  Outside of his photo development domain, he is bland and invisible, a man truly alone.  His life could not be more different from the lives he sees day by day in the pictures he develops - in the pictures of happy families, he sees everything he wants but cannot have.  Thus, it almost seems natural that he would begin to fantasize about being a part of such a life, to have a family of his own.  His favorite family is the Yorkins, a seemingly perfect young couple with one son.  Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) is one of Sy's best customers; she's always bringing in pictures to be developed.  Having watched the Yorkin family evolve over a number of years, Sy has adopted them as his own, making his own copies of all their pictures.  He knows Nina, her husband Will (Michael Vartan), and son Jake (Dylan Smith) intimately through their photos; he knows where they live, what their house is like, and all sorts of additional personal details about them.  In his own mind, he is Uncle Sy to Jake, and he tries to insinuate himself into the Yorkins' lives at just the time his own real life is beginning to fragment.  His job is no longer secure, and it is during this troubled time that he discovers that the Yorkins are not the ideal family after all.  That discovery is just more than he can take.<br /><br />This is not the kind of role you associate with Robin Williams, but there can be no doubt that this man is among the most accomplished of actors.  All of the natural energy Williams suppresses in his transformation to the externally calm, quiet, rather forgettable Sy Parrish lends his performance a power that few other actors could bring to such a role.  Writer and director Mark Romanek gave Williams a completely different look, and the set design and cinematography reinforces that directorial vision to lend the movie a sense of hyperreality that proves as unsettling as Sy's descent into mental disconnection.  The acting is superb all the way around, but Williams clearly steals the show with one of the most impressive performances I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />Topped off by a writer/director/actor commentary, a really well-made behind-the-scenes featurette, an "Anatomy of a Scene" Sundance Channel Featurette, and an extensive interview with Robin Williams and Mark Romanek on The Charlie Rose Show, One Hour Photo easily qualifies as a must-own DVD.</p></body></html>

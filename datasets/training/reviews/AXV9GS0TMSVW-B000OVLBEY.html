<meta name="summary" content="Yes, it's a bad movie.  But it's also good campy fun."></head><body><p>Ghost Rider falls into the "so bad it's good" category of films.  It's a bit of a fun guilty pleasure too.  Much like the character in the film, Nicholas Cage seems dead in his performance.  Though he's nowhere near as bad as Evan Mendes, who barely acted her way out of the Will Smith romcom, Hitch. There is one good actor in this movie - Sam Elliot.  But he's a born cowboy, and his character isn't too far from that role.<br /><br />This film celebrates the cliche ridden dialogue of built in blockbusters.  It also has some scenes that scream "bad blockbuster!," notably a scene where Eva Mendes' character is chased down by Johnny Blaze to ask for a date.  It's silly, and looks more like it belongs in the aforementioned Hitch, then this movie.<br /><br />The film actually does a credible job of building the tragic hero out of Johnny Blaze, but I think part of it has to do with Nicholas Cage's natural persona.  The Ghost Rider character seems silly instead of terrifying, and some of the other characters' reactions to Ghost Rider are questionable.  And while the overall special effects of Ghost rider look good, he just doesn't translate well the big screen.<br /><br />But the film overall seems like a throwback to some of these bad excessive blockbusters.  But it's got a comic book sensibility that's been lost in comic book films - the cheesy dialogue, unbelievable action sequences, and well enough room for a continuation.  It lacks the real darkness and depth of the character, however, solidified in the Ghost Rider books of the early '90s.  But it's a fun campy film that's a guiltly little pleasure - just don't expect it to be great.</p></body></html>

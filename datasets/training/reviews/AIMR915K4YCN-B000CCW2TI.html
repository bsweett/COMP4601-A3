She is seated next to a young man named Jackson (Cillian Murphy from 28 Days Later and Sunshine) whom she had met earlier in the terminal. The two get along famously, until Jackson reveals his secret. Lisa is now part of a plot involving political assassination and the life of her own father (Brian Cox from Manhunter and The Ring)! Surrounded by a plane-full of clueless passengers, Lisa must figure out a way to stop Jackson's plan and save several lives.

I know this movie has been trashed by self-proclaimed moralists, but the film is a vivid reminder that the world  is not the way we want it to be.<p>John Travolta stole the spotlight; his  portrayal of Vincent Vega is, by far, the best work he's ever done. Samuel  Jackson was also great. I also enjoyed Bruce Willis as the boxer -- his  performance was quite impressive. I also enjoyed Uma Thurman and Rosanna  Arquette in their supporting roles.<p>I recommend Pulp Fiction. The acting,  the incredibly witty script, and the way it was put together is a piece of  work! This should be on everyone's DVD collection.</p></body></html>

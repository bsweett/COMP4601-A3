But, I am not sure I even understood it.<br /><br />There are some truly wonderful points about this film.  The acting is outstanding.  Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem all give stellar performances.  You love Tommy as the country sheriff; you root for Josh Brolin all the way, and Javier Bardem is an extremely creepy bad guy.  There is also a great cast of tremendous supporting actors, who all give marvelous performances. The settings are authentic - there is no question that you are in rural Texas.  The cinematography adds to the feeling of desert and desolation.<br /><br />However, the plot is all over the place.  It SEEMS to be about the hunt for a psychopathic killer.  It SEEMS to be about the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad.  It SEEMS to be about the life of an old country sheriff in rural Texas.<br /><br />However, based on the odd, unfinished, unsatisfying end of this film, where TLJ is explaining the dreams he had the night before to his wife, the summation of the actual story appears to be "life sucks, and then you die."  That's it.<br /><br />I watch a movie for a number of reasons.  To be entertained.  To be moved or touched.  To learn something.  No Country for Old Men did none of these things.  At the end, I felt...nothing.  I have no impressions from it, no real thoughts about it.  Just a vague sense of "why?"...<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film to anyone.  The emperor truly is naked.</p></body></html>

While I enjoyed it, I think it's far too predictable and not as in-depth as other works by Dreamworks or Pixar. The plot is very simple and it doesn't pretend to be otherwise and kids will really get a kick out of the humour. I found myself laughing once or twice.<br /><br />The voice cast is really great especially Dustin Hoffman and Jack Black. Again, the animation is brilliant and certainly some of the finest I've seen in a long while. All in all, a simple but fun movie that the whole family will enjoy.</p></body></html>

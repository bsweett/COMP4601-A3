Attractive Stars & Lots of Guns."></head><body><p>"Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is part shoot'em up action flick, part romantic comedy that succeeds on the charisma of its stars and on its humor. John (Brad Pitt) and Jane (Angelina Jolie) Smith met in Columbia five or six years previously and married after a whirlwind romance. Unbeknownst to each other, John and Jane are both professional assassins working for competing agencies. They lie to each other about their jobs, hide their unusual talents, and live a sedate suburban life. So sedate, in fact, that their marriage has gotten stale. That all changes when they are both assigned the same target. Now they're gunning for each other -which sure does spice up their marriage.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" doesn't make much sense. It's never clear why John and Jane want to kill each other or if they really do. But they make quite a show of it. I couldn't figure out if they worked for private or government agencies, which are equally unlikely given the sort of action in this film. Jane's injuries disappear between scenes. The high-tech gadgets are more comical than cool. But neither action films nor comedies stake their success on realism. "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" realizes that, and director Doug Liman takes everything over the top. Even so, the action and cute banter would wear thin if the film didn't have 3 cycles in which John and Jane's situation changes. That shakes things up a bit and keeps the audience interested. There is a whole lot of violence in this movie purely for entertainment purposes. And it's not graphic; it's fun -which some people won't like. But "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is energetic fluff with 2 appealing stars bickering and shooting and generally looking like movie stars.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005): Bonus features include one featurette, 3 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer, a teaser, a soundtrack promotional spot, and 3 audio commentaries. "Making a Scene Featurette" (8 minutes) is a short documentary from Fox Movie Channel about creating the action scene in which John and Jane first confront each other as Jane speeds away in her car. The thought of listening to 3 audio commentaries was so daunting that I didn't listen to any, so I will just say: The first commentary is by director Doug Liman and screenwriter Simon Kinberg. The second commentary is by producers Akiva Goldman and Lucas Foster. The third commentary is by editor Michael Tronick, production designer Jeff Mann, and visual effects supervisor Kevin Elam. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.</p></body></html>

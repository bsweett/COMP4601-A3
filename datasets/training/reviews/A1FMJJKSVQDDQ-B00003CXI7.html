And it's no surprise that I had trouble walking into dark rooms for a few days because of it. What Lies Beneath is one of the scariest films I've ever seen; the jump scenes actually work (there are some you don't even expect in the least). The minimal music also helps with the creepy atmosphere (except for the jump scenes, of course). The plot may be a bit thin, but it didn't matter to me when I was watching it. The ghost in this film was as scary as the ones in all of those Asian horror films. And it's good to see some adults in this sort of horror flick, instead of stupid teenagers who do nothing but whine and scream. Zemeckis, Pheiffer, and Ford have done an extraordinary job with this film. And I hope we get to see more horror films that have a silent atmosphere and have no annoying little kids whatsoever.</p></body></html>

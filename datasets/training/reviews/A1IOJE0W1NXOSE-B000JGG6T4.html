Kidnappings are out of control in this area and most people with money find it necessary to hire a body guard for their children.  Washington admits to being an alcoholic and has an unhappy past which is never really explained, but which seems to have brought him to a place in life where he is a true loner.  The relationship between him and the little girl he is guarding is the focal point of the movie.  He at first resists her attempts at friendship, but eventually her sweet and matter-of-fact attitude win him over.  The sweetness of the relationship is juxtaposed with some over-the-top violence, and the blood lust of revenge which Washington exacts on anyone he feels has harmed the little girl.  This is a tense and emotional drama which shows Washington's acting skills at their best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Just plain fun!"></head><body><p>I recently saw the DVD 5.1 version of this film and it is excellent. The picture quality is, excuse the pun, picture perfect. The sound is very good on the surround but not much on dialog separation if any at all. But Alec Baldwin makes up for the rest. I have always told my partner that Alec would be the only guy in the world that i would leave him for.  I know it would never happen but each time i watch this movie my fantasy runs wild just like the movie itself.  This is just pure fun, pure entertainment, no thinking involved, no serious plot, no hardship, non racist, non potical just pure fun.  Get  it,,,,,you won't be disappointed.  If anything get it for Alec,,,,they don't get any hotter than him.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Decent!"></head><body><p>The plot is this simple....roommates go home to study/visit. There is a happy family that is excited that their daughter is home with a friend. There is a well loved cute little kid and a seemingly happily married couple. And there is a "truck driving mad man" who comes into the house and kills everyone, takes one roommate hostage with the other following to help with the big escape.  There are several other murders and great chase scenes, and lots of twists and turns in this movie, but you should be able to guess the ending way before it happens. My only criticism is  that I really didn't like the dubbing, at times it made the movie a little low budget and hokey. But if you like scary movies, you will enjoy it, you just have to ignore the dubbing!</p></body></html>

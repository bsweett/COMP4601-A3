Lots of twists and turns that I was not expecting from the Butler character.<br /><br />I like Gerard Butler, Jamie Foxx, Colm Meaney, Bruce McGill and Josh Stewart, which were all the main reasons that I watched this film.  And I'm glad that I did because most of the actors turned a mediocre plot into a good movie.  Butler was great in his role as the vengeance-driven engineer with a secret past.  Foxx was not so great - wooden, one-dimensional (if he'd been on the top of his game, this would have been a stellar movie).  The others were great in their supporting roles.<br /><br />The ending could have been more fitting to the direction the rest of the film went but I enjoyed it.<br /><br />NOTE:  Lots of violence, rape scene, language, torture.</p></body></html>

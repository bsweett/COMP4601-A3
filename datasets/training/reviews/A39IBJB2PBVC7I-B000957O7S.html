<meta name="summary" content="Should Have Un-Hitched It From The Trailer"></head><body><p>Get out! Stop! I mean it! This is so funny! His name is Alex Hitchens, they call him Hitch, and he helps people get hitched. Stop it! That is too clever! (Yikes).<br /><br />The best thing you can say about this formulaic twaddle is that it's inoffensive, which is precisely what makes it so awful. Hitch has UCLA film school screenplay written all over it, especially the knucklehead antics ensuing as doctor and client wrestle in parallel. Then comes the wildly unsurprising payout - Albert is really much more wise in the ways of love than Alex. Who saw that bombshell coming?<br /><br />What little joy there is to be milked from this ancient cow comes through the grace of lovely Allegra, Amber Valletta, and Albert, Kevin James. The character of Allegra is a preposterous concoction, but Ms. Valletta gives it authenticity, quite an achievement. As to Kevin James, this is one fine comic actor who seems completely natural and comfortable on camera. He is both gifted and skilled with a marvelous way of achieving the virtually impossible task of making comedy look easy. As far as Will Smith goes, well, it's not far enough.<br /><br />I wouldn't say Smith is incapable of acting, because I have seen him turn in credible performances. But, I would say that no one has cruised quite so effortlessly down the freeway for so long with so little gas in the tank. Frankly, Smith is likeable and non-threatening, his appeal rests in his good looks and the absolute certainty that he will never do or say anything remotely interesting or controversial.<br /><br />Let's not downplay the value provided here. In a tormented world, some folks want to take a date to the movies secure in the knowledge that every emotion they're about to experience has been reviewed and approved by the FDA. But I'm not three of them. Un-hitch the movie, I'll just watch the trailer.</p></body></html>

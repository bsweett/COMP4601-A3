<meta name="summary" content="Alexander"></head><body><p>First off, let me just say that I would never make a film on Alexander because I do not posses the quantity of mind to. I know I cannot reach that level of perfection so it's easy to criticise another's work.When you're making a film on Alexander you expect everything to be larger than life yet quite close to most people's perception of reality. Colin Farrell made a weak, very disappointing, disillusioning Alexander. I wanted to like this film but the very character that played the lead role failed to remotely bring justice to the king of kings.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film at first and tried my best to ignore the over obsessive Angelina Jolie who played the role of Olympus. Let me just say the half impish Russian accent she sported did no good for outlining her character.The war scenes in the film aren't really anything like we haven't ever seen before.There is nothing the film tries to over emphasise on. I could take this film seriously for the 160 minutes of it's playing time.The person who played the Persian King was more fit for his role than any other person in this film. Babylon was shown with a lot of glory and quite rightfully so.<br /><br />I hear from a lot of people that the story is twisted in it's own way. Alexander wasn't murdered they say. I do not believe it is correct to diss the film on this basis. The best scene in the film comes when Alexander's 40,000 army fights the 250,000. There is a shot of an eagle flying in the sky and the camera is focussed on the war below from the eagle's eye.<br /><br />Watch this film if you saw Troy and must watch everything that is focussed on an ancient epic tale of a leader of men. Colin Farrell gave his 90% to this film but then his capacity fails him from personifying Alexander. A friend mentioned the actor of Van Helsing would have made a better Alexander. I agree.<br /><br />P.S-<br /><br />To "Amanda Richards(who wrote a poem for her review of the same)<br /><br />Nice work. Was it a school assignment? Sarcasm & Poetry? Can you possibly get any more overdramatic and innovative at the same time?</p></body></html>

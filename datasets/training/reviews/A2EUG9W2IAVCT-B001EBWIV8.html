<meta name="summary" content="A visual effects masterpiece--save for some Hollywoodization"></head><body><p>The Matrix Revolutions has great graphics and great action, and it's pretty touching too--a surprise for most action-based films. Too bad parts of it are quite clique, like the Hammer's Captain Rowland (of the ship Jada Pinkett Smith's character pilots into Zion who comments on her flying throughout the sequence) using profane language in every sentence he speaks. Except for those slight "Hollywood moments," this film rocks on every level--it's full of great special effects, thoughtful introspection (it's got a great meaning) and some superb acting (except for those constant stereotypical curses). Overall, extremely satisfying.</p></body></html>

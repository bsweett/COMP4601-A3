<meta name="summary" content="Made for Money Only"></head><body><p>This has to be the biggest money maker to have nothing to it.  It has no story, no plot, no acting, and no script.  The special effects are average at best, it looks really fake on TV.  The aliens use Macintosh software to run their spaceship no wonder they lost.  This movie released in 1996 made 306 million dollars and was the first in many to just base a movie on special effects. Please don't buy this because they will just keep making more movies like this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very nice movie (even when it is a musical)"></head><body><p>When I bought this bluray, I did not expect it to be as musical as high school musical. I was expecting it to be more like sound of music (less music, more movie). They break into songs every 5 minutes. But after a while, I began to appreciate it. This movie is really good. If a heavy metal fan can enjoy this movie, I guess the rest of you could too. Very good bluray. Very cool video. Audio is awesome too.</p></body></html>

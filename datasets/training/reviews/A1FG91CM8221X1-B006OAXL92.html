<meta name="summary" content="Scorsese waves his magic wand."></head><body><p>Most of the reviewers here have been very careful to preserve the plot surprises in Martin Scorsese's "Hugo," and I will be too, although by now many writers have spilled the beans. So all I will say is that "Hugo" is one of those very rare movies that lives up to the phrase, "movie magic." Scorsese has us in the palm of his hand from the first shot, a magnificent panoramic sweep of a Paris train station circa 1930, and keeps us there all the way to the expected happy ending. The basic story--Hugo (Asa Butterfield), a misprized Parisian orphan who keeps the station clocks running, even as he tries to evade capture by the officious station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen)--is one just about any child can relate and thrill to. But the story really opens up once it gets to Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), curmudgeonly proprietor of the station's toy shop, and his beloved goddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz).<br /><br />"Hugo" can best be described as a voyage of discovery, using extraordinarily sophisticated cinematic techniques to create a marvelously sustained mood of childlike wonder. As Hugo and Isabelle, piece by piece, uncover the life story of Papa Georges, Scorsese pays glorious tribute to the early days of the cinema, and to the pioneers who created it. This is the first film I have ever seen in which the director uses 3D to advance the story, not just to provide chills and thrills to the audience. The effect is that of Scorsese, like Papa Georges within the movie, waving his magic wand to cast a spell of enchantment over the audience.<br /><br />Scorsese's usual crew is here--photographer Robert Richardson, designer Dante Ferretti and editor Thelma Schoonmaker--and their work is flawless. Also flawless is the cast; "Hugo" features a veritable honor roll of some of the best actors working today, including the aforementioned players as well as Helen McCrory, Emily Mortimer, Ray Winstone, Michael Stuhlbarg, Richard Griffiths, Frances de la Tour, and--in a brief, poignant cameo--Jude Law.<br /><br />If I were as curmudgeonly as Papa Georges, I could complain that the story of "Hugo" stretches a little thin toward the end. But considering the glittering cinematic art that surrounds it, that complaint is extremely minor. It's a cliche to say a movie will delight children of all ages, but in the case of "Hugo," it happens to be true.</p></body></html>

That's when you figure out just what's been going on and what's going to happen, and it really stinks that you've figured it out. Because the mystery weaved throughout the movie is certainly a good one, a really creepy one, but part of the magic of a thriller or horror movie is the directors/writers ability to keep the mystery a secret until just the right moment. Dang, and this movie was SOOOO close.<br /><br />The movie stars Kate Hudson as Caroline, a hospice worker. She leaves her job because she doesn't like the impersonality of the whole ordeal, ie, old person dies, old person is zipped up in a bag, and then their stuff is thrown out. Where's the caring in that? So she takes a job as a caretaker for an elderly man who has had a stroke. His wife (Gena Rowlands) is also there to help and gives Caroline a skeleton key that opens every creaky door in their creepy Southern, bayou mansion. Caroline soon discovers a door in the attic, containing secrets of magic and "hoodoo." (nope, not voodoo! Hoodoo!) But what does this have to do with the house? It's previous inhabitants? The inhabitants now? This is the mystery, and I won't go any further with plot details for fear of giving anything away.<br /><br />Peter Sarsgaard co-stars as a lawyer, and what little bits of the movie he's in are wonderfully effective: his southern drawl makes you like him but it also makes you leery. Very cool. Kate Hudson is great, though her character gets lost in the plot shuffle, and there was a really interesting little story about how her caring for elderly people relates to the relationship she had with her father. If only more thrillers would take the time to develop character in the way they meticulously nitpick the plot... well, we can only dream. RECOMMENDED.</p></body></html>

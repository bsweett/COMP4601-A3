And the only thing that I can see that was done "right" in this film was the CGI effects.<br /><br />Let's start with the plot:<br /><br />First, Van Helsing is no longer the lovable old guy who is constantly on the trail of Count Dracula. Here we have Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman, X-Men) as a kind of dark arch-angel who works for a secret society in the Catholic Church who's charge is to protect society from abominations (i.e., Mr. Hyde, Ogres, etc.), thus helping Christianity and goodness flourish across the planet.<br /><br />About 15 minutes into the film, we finally see Van Helsing being assigned to the Dracula legend in Transylvania. He has to save a young woman (Kate Beckinsale) from the dastardly clutches of the blood sucking fiend. If he doesn't, doom will encompass the countryside.<br /><br />Here's how the rest of the film goes: Having long dialogue with vampires before battling them ...and winning. Having long dialogue with vampires before battling them ...and losing. Having long dialogue with vampires before battling them ...and winning.<br /><br />The plot --- if there is one --- is basically to kill Count Dracula. But there are so many other things going on (the struggle of Frankenstein to "exist" --- which I thought was the best side story of the entire film ---, the development of baby-vampires --- don't ask ---, and a slew of other terrible ideas) that I felt completely and utterly wasted as a movie viewer.<br /><br />Other problems:<br /><br />Umm, this is supposed to be about saving people from Dracula and saving Christianity, right? So what was with the burning funeral pyre at the end of the movie (isn't that a Pagan thing?)<br /><br />The film starts off in black-and-white in the late 1800's, giving the viewer the understanding that the action during this time took place long ago. And then we jump ahead an entire ...YEAR! and switch to color. Wow. That was lame.<br /><br />I can't begin to tell you how horrible this film was. There's more horrors to be told, but I have to head to the bathroom. I feel ...oh no! ...GHACKKK!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A perfect &quot;Oscar movie&quot; but not much else"></head><body><p>Well, it appears that this film made enough academy members weep and decide finally to throw an Oscar Ron Howard's way (which he truly has deserved in the past), but this film is not nearly as remarkable or memorable as these awards would suggest.  [Just read what the serious reviewers had to say at rottentomatoes.]<p>In addition to the fact that it is in essence a &quot;fictionalization&quot; of Nash's life, I found the film uneven and, gasp, even boring!  And what's worse, much to my friends' horror, I found I didn't even care about the John Nash portrayed in the film.  As portrayed he is certainly a tragic figure, but despite Howard's often over-wrought style, Crowe's Nash is not particularly noble, courageous or even likable.  I didn't feel much if anything for this man, but I know that I'm supposed to like him because that's Russell Crowe up there on the screen and that's Ron Howard directing him.  Well, rather than swallow this bland bait, I'd rather watch something meaningful.  I guess that's why I'm not an academy voter...<p>If you want to watch this as a work of fiction, and you can stomach the manipulative tenor of Howard's direction, I guess you'll like &quot;A Beautiful Mind.&quot;  If, however, you care about legitimate portrayals of historical figures, and you'd rather not have the director play on your emotions without any real substance to back it up, don't bother.  There are scores of films that are much more beautiful out there.</p></body></html>

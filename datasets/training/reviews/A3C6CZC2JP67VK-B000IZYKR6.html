<meta name="summary" content="This Candy is Hard to Swallow."></head><body><p>The topic of pedophile has been revisited once again; following the recent slew of similarly-themed shows like the `Woodsman' and `Mysterious Skin.' But this time round, pedophile isn't the theme of the show; it is simply a cat-and-mouse-ish thriller between a teenage girl and a suspected pedophile. This movie is dark; hell, what story about pedophile wouldn't be, and the acting is nothing short of excellent. Both characters are extremely convincing and both shock in their respective ways. Brian Nelson's intelligent script is abound with surprising twists, dark humor and bitter exchanges which will provoke discussions among viewers.<br /><br />Hayley (Ellen Page) is convincing as the teenage girl with a vigilante agenda, and Jeff (ambiguous Patrick Wilson) is good as well. The characters that they portray just don't seem to be very realistic in this film. A teenage girl endangering her life into a pedophiles house just to expose his dark secret? This film also features some truly disturbing scenes but nothing explicit. The flaw that I have with this film is that I'm not sure exactly who the makers wanted us to root for, because the girl is portrayed as mildly unhinged and explicitly psychotic, while the alleged pedophile comes across as the victim. Surely if he's the bad guy, we want the girl to succeed and to truly torment him, but in this film we are forced to side with the pedophile which is quite disturbing to me.<br /><br />However, overlooking this is the simple fact that for the performances alone and the quality of the considered direction giving us some heart-pounding suspense. `Hard Candy' is a fine piece of cinema that offers a great deal in comparison to other movies produced nowadays and deserves a view.</p></body></html>

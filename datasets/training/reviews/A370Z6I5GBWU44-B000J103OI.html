<meta name="summary" content="Nice chick flick"></head><body><p>Yes, it's a chick flick, but a good one. Merryl Streep does a very good job in her role as the aforementioned 'devil', while Anne Hathaway plays the new assistant/intern who has to deal with the devil, who is a very strict, demanding, and at times, outright hostile/mean woman. Streep especially shines in her role and carries it well.</p></body></html>

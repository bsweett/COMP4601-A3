Casino is about relationships between characters in and around organized crime and gambling, and it's about the arc that an entire city of pleasure takes over these people.<p>It's Scorsese and Pileggi and DeNiro and Pesci and Frank Vincent again and it's a top-notch, gorgeous gangster epic.  <p>In the early 70s the Chicago Outfit sends Sam 'Ace' Rothstein out to Las Vegas to manage the casinos they're skimming cash from.  Ace is a gambling master, a sure-bettor who never loses; soon the Tangiers is raking in more dough than ever due to his management.  In order to better 'manage', the Outfit also sends Nicky Santoro, a crafty but hot-headed soldiers (Pesci) to Vegas, to provide the muscle.  Pretty soon Pesci is smacking people around, stabbing them with pens, putting their heads in vices, and even vandalizing their cars (not to mention flat-out threatening to crack their heads open) all as he looks to set up his own empire away from the Dons in the Midwest.  <p>When Ace marries a call girl named Ginger (Sharon Stone) and attempts to start a family, things start going downhill.  Ginger is still involved with her old pimp, for one.  And let me pause to mention that James Woods has played possibly the sleaziest, most disgusting rat pimp of all time, from the subtleties like his mustache and mesh shirt to his cheap talk and bullying threats.  Eventually, Ace, Nicky, Ginger, Nicky's Vegas crew, they all manage to bring the house crashing down on them.  <p>This is all based on the true story of the Chicago Mob in Las Vegas and the hold the families had on the big casinos.  Pillegi's source book is an interesting account for sure, with more commentary from some minor characters in the film, giving it different angles than just the Deniro-Stone-Pesci trifecta.  <p>The film looks gorgeous, it has to be one of Scorsese's biggest budgets.  The 70s clothes, the cars, the settings--they manage to scrounge up enough un-touched 70s Vegas left, and they film in real casinos quite a bit.  <p>The film is three hours long; there's a lot packed into this.  Along the way it can be fun; the voiceover sequences of Ace describing the workings of a casino, or how people cheat (and get caught) playing blackjack, or the montage of Nicky's gangster antics, all make this very engaging.  The film is a lot bloodier than Goodfellas, and even had to be cut (during the infamous head-vice scene.)  <p>This can't be recommended highly enough, HOWEVER, once again we have a very lame DVD, not as bad as Goodfellas, but not much better.  You don't have to flip this one over, but for a three hour film, there are far too FEW chapters, making it very frustrating if you want to watch certain portions again.  There's a trailer, wow!  There's also some text you can read on the production and the stars, but quite frankly, that is one of the lamest features they try to put on discs.  Can't they simply print production notes in a booklet?<p>If you haven't seen this or Goodfellas, come out of the cave.  If you listen to some people who say 'It's like Goodfellas, but not as good', well, you can let them think for you.  It's as good as Goodfellas, and arguably better.  <p>And Joe Pesci has some of the most choice swearing lines...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A good Tom Cruise movie?"></head><body><p>Can it be?  OK--he was pretty good in Risky Business and I don't remember seeing him in Eyes Wide Shut but otherwise, Tom Cruise doesn't move me.  The phony smile, the clenched hands...I dunno.<br /><br />But everyone is good in Collateral.  (The hispanic guy who plays the drug lord is fabulous).  The plot has just enough originality, some realistic dialog and even a clever and almost plausible twist at the end.<br /><br />Although not very insightful the exchanges in the cab make it play like a play but with a movie ending.  Certainly not 5 stars but you could do far worse.  Maybe this is our reward for suffering through Vanilla Sky and Magnolia.<br /><br />Next Summer, I hope to see Jamie Foxx driving a bulletproof limo in Collateral II.</p></body></html>

As soon as I saw that Nicolas Cage was playing a con man with OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) I thought it would get tedious in no time, but Cage handled it well. OCD was an important aspect of his character, and it also influenced the outcome. Cage won an Oscar for playing an alcoholic who is "Leaving Las Vegas" and his performance here is up near that level. He really has a knack for playing afflicted characters.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell, as Frank, his partner, was pretty good; but Alison Lohman, as his daughter, Angela, was spectacular. There are tender moments between the daughter and her estranged father that are really touching, and that is hard to do. How easily it becomes cloying if handled wrong. Alison as Angela was very believable as the daughter, who has inherited her father's gift for grift.<br /><br />Matchstick Men continually surprises, and that is good. Nothing is as it seems, and there are some really clever twists. Ridley Scott, who directed Blade Runner, really knows his business. There was great choices of music throughout. Frank Sinatra, The Tijuana Brass, Nino Rota, Bobby Darin, Roxy Music, Kid Rock, and more. Each song was carefully chosen and placed so it commented on the action, but didn't really draw attention to itself and away from the story, because it just seemed so right for the moment.<br /><br />Bottomline is Matchstick Men is a good film from Ridley Scott, but it is not as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729628">Blade Runner (The Director's Cut)</a>. It has a great performance from Nicolas Cage, but not quite as good as Leaving Las Vegas. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304981643">The Grifters</a> is a better movie about con artistry, and Matchstick Men is not quite that good, but it comes very close. It beats The Flim Flam Man.<br /><br />SELECTED FILMS AND ROLES OF NICOLAS CAGE<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OVLBF8">Ghost Rider (Widescreen Edition)</a> (2007) Nicolas Cage was Johnny Blaze / Ghost Rider<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLRE">Adaptation (Superbit Collection)</a> (2002) Nicolas Cage was Charlie Kaufman / Donald Kaufman<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792838068">Leaving Las Vegas</a> (1995) Nicolas Cage was Ben Sanderson<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792844831">Honeymoon in Vegas</a> (1992) Nicolas Cage was Jack Singer<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00062IVM6">Wild At Heart</a> (1990) Nicolas Cage was Sailor Ripley<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLFA">Valley Girl</a> (1983) Nicolas Cage was Randy<br /><br />SELECTED ROLES OF OTHER CAST MEMBERS<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O2UTQS">Choke</a> (2008) Sam Rockwell was Victor Mancini<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JT69IW">Drag Me to Hell</a> (2009) Alison Lohman was Christine Brown<br /><br />-----------------------------<br />Roy: For some people, money is... money is a foreign film without subtitles.<br />==================================</p></body></html>

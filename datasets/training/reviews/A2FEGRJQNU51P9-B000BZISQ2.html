<meta name="summary" content="a worthy installment in the franchise"></head><body><p>This is the newest film in the Terminator franchise.  The first two films were directed by James Cameron, but a new director has taken the reins for this one.  The director is Jonathon Mostow (U-571, Breakdown).  I was a little nervous going into this movie because of this change in the director.  James Cameron had made two classic, genre defining films that pushed the special effects teams to the limits (especially on Terminator 2).  Mostow had a lot to live up to and I wasn't confident that he could do the job.  I was wrong.  Mostow did not make a Terminator movie the way that James Cameron would have done, but he made a worthy entry into the Terminator franchise.  <p>One thing to note about this movie is that it is not nearly as gritty (emotionally or in the content of the movie) as the first two Terminator movies (especially not as much as the first one).  While this uses the elements and story of the Terminator franchise, this is not a hard science fiction film but more of an action film.  It also works very well on this level.  Here is the back story that we know going into this movie: In the near future all of our lives will be run through computers.  Our military will use one great supercomputer to manage the military functions.  This computer will become self-aware and take control of the world through computers (which run everything).  There will be a war between man and machine and the machines will win.  Humans will be almost wiped from the face of the planet until there are only small pockets of resistance left.  One man will rise to lead the humans: John Connor.  In the first Terminator movie, the machines sent a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother.  John sent back a man who would become his father to protect Sarah Connor.  In the second Terminator movie, the machines sends back an advanced model to kill a 13 year old John Connor.  The model that was sent back to kill Sarah in the first movie was sent back in time to protect John in the second movie.  This brings us to the third Terminator movie.  John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now in his 20's.  His mother has died of Leukemia and John is living on the fringes of society.  He lives in such a way that there is no record of his existence (he works on the theory that if he can't be found, he can't be killed).  He lives a gloomy existence because even though the judgement day in 1997 has come and past without incident, he doesn't really feel that it is over.  A new Terminator T-X (Kristanna Loken) has been sent back to kill both John Connor, but failing that to kill the men and women who will become his lieutenants in the resistance against the machines.  <p>The T-X appears to be an updated version of the T-1000 that Robert Patrick played in Terminator 2.  The T-X is also made of the liquid metal that the T-1000 was, but there are added abilities.  One: the T-X has functional weapons built into it.  The T-X can turn its arm into a gun/flamethrower and various other weapons.  The other major upgrade is that the T-X can remotely control other machines.  This provides for a rather impressive chase sequence involving a van, cop cars, fire engines and one bulky vehicle with a crane.  The T-X was also designed to destroy other Terminators.  To protect John Connor, the Arnold model from the first two movies is sent back to protect John and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), the woman who would become John's second in command.  The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenneger) is an outdated model but was the only one the resistance was able to capture and reprogram.<br />This is the set up for the movie.  Kate is the disbelieving woman that Sarah Connor was in the first movie, but there is great chemistry between John and Kate and this helps the movie a lot.  <p>One thing that The Terminator tells John is that the Judgement Day has not been stopped, only delayed and that it is still coming...very soon.  As you can tell from the subtitle of the movie: Rise of the Machines, the machine uprising begins during this movie.  I mentioned that this movie didn't have the grit of the previous movies, and this is true, but it is not a very upbeat film and with the Machines beginning the war we are not given a very happy movie.  We are given a good one, though.  Terminator 3 is not perfect, but it far exceeded my expectations.</p></body></html>

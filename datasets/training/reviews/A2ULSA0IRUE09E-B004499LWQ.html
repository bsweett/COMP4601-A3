<meta name="summary" content="Overrated and badly acted"></head><body><p>Despite being a fan of serious, artsy cinema, I fail to understand why "Closer" has gotten the acclaim it has. All four leads turn in pretty mediocre performances, though this could be due to the weak script - one of those overblown ones that look fabulous on paper and jaw-droppingly awful when spoken by actors - and Julia Roberts' perplexing drag-queen like performance does nothing to elevate the quality of this cinema.<br /><br />Depsite Natalie Portmans' desperate attempts at some sort of nouveau-style attempt at dramatics (her breakdown scene when Jude Law leaves her is particularly embarrassing), the film wears thin in about a half hour. This is because you know exactly what happens, and you know that these four characters are going to be kicked around so hard that by the end of the film you feel sympathy for none of them. And thats exactly what happened.<br /><br />"Closer" is the story of two couples whose lives intertwine. Most of this has got to do with sexual attraction - romance and love take a back seat, and this was an aspect of the film that did not appeal to me. Its as if the director really wanted to show us a dark, depressing side of relationships, but at the same time wanted to infuse the film with the air of an 'artiste', so in the end you have a very snobbish film with no substance or artistic merit whatsoever. If people behaved like people in this film do, we'd all be rather stunned, simply because none of the characters carry themselves with the remote consistency of a human being. The play is robotic even, and if that was the intended effect, even that wasn't done very well.<br /><br />I particularly have a problem with Jude Laws' character in the film because the actor has really compromised both on his acting and choice of roles on this one. Forget the tawdry net-lingo used in the movie, its difficult to imagine someone being so spineless and fearless at the same time. Even if they were, Jude Law doesn't do a very good job of convincing us. Julia Roberts looks frighteningly like a man in this movie, seeming so much older than all of her costars, including Clive Owen who is no spring chicken to begin with. Not that this is a bad thing, but it really removes her from the spirit of the film. Natalie Portman is far more effective, but the horrendous dialogue they give her ruins any chance she has.<br /><br />The DVD of "Closer" is a welcome addition because I believe every film student should see this movie. Its quirky and will be talked about, but to me thats for all the wrong reasons. Unlike real modern classics like 'The Machinist' this movie wants to be a cutting edge dark film so desperately, that it shows. And when that happens, it can't do much else than fall to pieces. This is very poor film-making, and I wish the acclaimed director would go back to making films the way he used to instead of using overpaid Hollywood stars in meaningless films about relationships based on lust and deceit.<br /><br />An ineffective film. Two stars.<br /><br />kabitat@gmail.com</p></body></html>

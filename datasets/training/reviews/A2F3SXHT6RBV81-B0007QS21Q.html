When I was there, the streets were teaming with people from all walks of life and hurrying as if their very lives depended on getting there first. This is a sterile place full of interactive robots, inside and out. Some of the blue-eyed Sonny robots had started to malfunction after the doctor is found dead on Daley Plaza. It was put forth that Sonny was a "mistake" as the doc had programmed him to dream and to obey his wishes. You do what someone asks you if you love them. I loved the cat.<br /><br />Chicago had never looked more beautiful, clean, no clutter, no rubbish. We all have a purpose for being where we are at any particular time or place. Sonny had performed the thing he was made for. "Now I have fulfilled my purpose, I don't know what to do." That's what it feels like to be free. Why's that? The killer robots with red light attempted a Revolution, but the good guys aided by Sonny'who couldn't die technically as he had never been alive, put Vicci out of commission and its undeniable logic is transformed and diminished until virtually dead. The homicide detective ate a whole sweet potato pie before he pursued and tackled a robot thought to be stealing a purse in the downtown Loop area, but it was all a misunderstanding.<br /><br />This was documented history and some excessive violence like in the tunnel with the auto accident. The human cop had artificial arm, hand, and internal organs. Someday this world may exist, but it won't be in our lifetime.</p></body></html>

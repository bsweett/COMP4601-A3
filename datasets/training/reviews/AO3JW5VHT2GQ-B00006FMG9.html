<meta name="summary" content="Better than Hannibal"></head><body><p>Summary:<br />The movie begins with the capture of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) by FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton).  However, the capture isn't a simple, "Put your hands up."  Both Lecter and Graham are seriously wounded.  Lecter ends up in his famous cell and Graham retires from the FBI.  But when a new series of serial murders begins, Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel), Graham's boss, convinces Graham to come back to work for the agency to help them find the person they are calling 'The Tooth Fairy'.  Graham returns to the FBI but in working on the case he must request the help of Lecter.  Lecter, who has become quite famous for his murders, is also contacted by the serial killer who considers himself to be the incarnation of Blake's Red Dragon.  Graham has to work out the details and connections to figure out who the killer is while dealing with the psychological manipulations of Lecter.  The result is a climactic scene similar to the beginning of the movie when Lecter is captured.<p>My Comments:<br />I'll reveal my bias from the beginning - I love psychological thrillers and I'm fascinated by serial killers.  So, in reading my review you may want to keep that in mind.  The only problem I had with this movie is I wasn't sure Edward Norton was the perfect fit for an FBI agent.  I really like Norton in most of his roles and he plays all sorts of characters, there was just something about him as a serial killer profiler that didn't work perfectly.  I still think he did a good job, but I just wasn't sure I was as convinced that he was being played with psychologically - at least, not nearly as convinced as I was when Jodi Foster was being played with by Lecter in Silence of the Lambs.  So, that was a small problem.<p>Otherwise, the acting was great.  I particularly enjoyed Ralph Fiennes (Francis Dolarhyde & the Red Dragon).  He came across as extremely disturbed, which, obviously, was what he was supposed to be.  <p>I read the book Hannibal before I watched the movie and was pretty disappointed by the movie.  I haven't read Red Dragon, so I don't know how they compare.  However, from my past experience reading Thomas Harris novels, I'm guessing that the book is probably better than the movie.  <p>I also cheated when I was watching the DVD.  I have a tendency to look at the length of movies before I watch them - usually because I'm pretty busy and have to plan accordingly.  Well, as I was watching Red Dragon, I realized that Francis Dolarhyde had allegedly been killed at about 112 minutes but I knew the movie was 124 minutes long.  I wasn't positive what was going to happen next, I thought Lecter might escape, but once they showed Graham back at his home in Florida it clicked.  I liked the ending.  However, I'm not sure that it made perfect sense as serial killers go.  Of course, I'm not an expert on serial killer profiling and maybe it does, I just thought that it was actually plausible that Dolarhyde would kill himself instead of killing Reba McClane (Emily Watson).  To do what he did was pretty calculating and based upon how he seemed to be acting prior to that, I wasn't sure it worked perfectly, but I was ultimately satisfied.<p>Overall, I liked this movie better than Hannibal but not quite as much as Silence of the Lambs.  If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs or like psychological thrillers, you'll probably enjoy this movie.  As with all movies about serial killers, it can be a bit disturbing (one of the people we were watching it with actually left the room she was so disturbed by it) what with references to eating people and what not.  But perhaps Lecter's fascination with cannibalism is what keeps fans of Thomas Harris's novels coming back.</p></body></html>

I say this because people I trust were unimpressed by it.  But I was compelled to watch the Mike Nichols' film for reasons that I can only describe as masochistic - and I'm not a masochist.  The characters are recognizable and reprehensible, pretty much the gang of healthy and privileged idiots you can meet anywhere in the U.S. or U.K., where the bulk of "Closer" takes place.  The story is a human traffic accident, literally in one scene and implied in another.  Though the dialogue is stagy, the actors deliver it with proper angst, which is suitable for a film that is really just barely a play with a few visual tricks thrown in.  (A lot in "Closer" happens offscreen and is told in flashback and expository dialogue, the film's major weakness).  Jude Law, who resembles rather disturbingly John Boy Walton when donning spectacles, plays a hack writer whose chance meeting with a provocateur (Natalie Portman -- kudos to her for being unafraid to reveal her burgeoning cellulite) and later dalliance with a wishy-washy photographer (Julia Roberts) leads to his eventual downfall.  Almost-James Bond (thank goodness) Clive Owen pops in as a dermatologist who isn't quite as thick skulled as he seems.  No one is likable in "Closer," which may be part of the reason I enjoyed it; their folly seems to confirm so many of my own observations about people who are incapable of loving relationships with anyone because they don't know the first things about themselves.  Yet, fortune gives them a steady stream of paramours to damage.  Go figure.  Under Nichols' steady hand, including some verbal and visual cues that subtly forecast events, "Closer" wends its way to a conclusion that is inevitable and would be tragic if the characters were even remotely heroic.  As it stands, they're just like most of the people you meet.</p></body></html>

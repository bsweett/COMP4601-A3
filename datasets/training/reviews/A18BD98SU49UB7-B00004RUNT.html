<meta name="summary" content="Welcome to To the Sixth Element"></head><body><p>The fifth element is an action film, hosted by the great Bruce Willis. There are visuals in the Fifth Element that even to this day look terrific. Compare the Flying cars to the traffic in the backgrounds of Episode I. Lets first understand that The Fifth Element is a visual eye candy extravaganza. Not necessarily the best, but very imaginative. The story is also an invention that couldn't have easily been dreamed up. It's pretty original. Its almost hard to take a movie like The Fifth Element and break it down into pieces, but there are things that could have been better. The story was great, but there where "thickeners" that kept getting in the way. I loved the Chris Tucker character. He kept me laughing throughout the action. But, why put him in this movie at all? I see no reason whatsoever. When it comes down to it, there was no reason. He was comedic relief and thats all. I thought the movie stood still the moment he walked onto the scene. He was great, but out of place. Almost every scene could have been edited in some way. I love long movies, they can sometimes have a lot more to offer, but when a scene gets slow that means it needs to be trimmed to be more direct. Especially in an action film like this. Without these problems the movie would have been more enjoyable and less predictable, but its still a good movie worth seeing. Its lots of fun.</p></body></html>

Or those movies where the last 20 or so minutes of the film baffle you with their sweet emotionally profound dialogues? Films where your head is in such a state of whirl that you're almost gutted with beauty?<br /><br />Well, The Jacket made me stand up and clap. The last half hour of the film is not only gripping but it shows why Adrien Brody is who he is. There is something queer about the look in his eye and his imperfect yet perfect nose or is it just me. His smile,whether you like it or not, is powerful in it's depiction of both mystery and the opposite.<br /><br />The Jacket is a calm yet gravitating film. The direction is intelligent and the sets are just apt to portray the film and it's characters. It did remind me a bit of Butterfly Effect, Back To The Future and in some ways, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.<br /><br />The only slight drawback of the film is Keira Knightley's acting. Otherwise, it's a certain 9/10<br /><br />Anyhow, just so you can compare and understand why you need "the jacket" (I own the dvd now)<br /><br />Imdb.com Rating - 6.9/10 [geez the opinionated world :) ]<br /><br />My Rating  - 8.5/10 [watch asap,ignore haters and philistines]</p></body></html>

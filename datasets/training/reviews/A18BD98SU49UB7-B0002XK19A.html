But I will honestly say out of the countless superhero films I have seen: this is, without a doubt, the best.<br /><br />What seperates Spider Man 2, a sequel no less, from its counterpart and all of the other fx crazed superhero movies hollywood has to offer? Simply put, it takes its time. It pauses for a breath and dwells on the human side of Spider Man. He is after all, Peter Parker beneath the mask. He is a human being full of emotional weakness' with physical and spiritual longings. There's love pounding at his hearts door and he doesn't know what to do with it.<br /><br />The villain this time around is a caring professor that loves what he does and has a tender heart for education and furthering the betterment of man. Only when he is "possessed" by his creation is he a villain. He wasn't heading that way in the first place like Willem Defoe in part one. I found myself, as many others, feeling sorry for him, and hoping all the way through that he too will be saved.<br /><br />Sam Raimi took hold of the reins with the same ambition of his original films, the Evil Dead series. Like the saga or not, you could see the fun they were having all the way through. Now it seems, he has developed the same sincerity towards Spiderman.<br /><br />Spiderman 2 rests on common ground, then stands tall, rising uniquely over the rest. Add this to your collection, it has my seal. ~S.A.O.S.~</p></body></html>

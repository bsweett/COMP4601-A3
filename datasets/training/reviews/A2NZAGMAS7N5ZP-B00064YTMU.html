<meta name="summary" content="Michael Mann At His Best!"></head><body><p>If you are looking for action, Suspense and Tom Cruise as a bad guy! Than you have found the perfect 120 min movie to watch. While not as good As Heat, this smart action thriller presents a different kind of movie; one that actually feels a bit different. Michael Mann this time brings a unique camera work that mixes documentary style with digital...it's kind of hard to describe, but it works, it gives the film a sort of "independent" filmmaking look. Unfortunately Mann would use this exact same technique on "Miami Vice" in which it looks atrocious.<br /><br />Collateral begins with Max (Jaime Foxx) a Taxi Driver who is working on changing his usual routine and perhaps one day establishes his own "Limo" company. Max's daily routine changes when he picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise) a hit man that kidnaps Max. Vincent needs Max to drive him around, take him where his victims are. I will not spoil more, but I must say that this flick will leave you plugged until the last minute. The best scene is a shootout in a club; it's so amazingly well shot. Not to mention also the music that plays in the background, superb<br /><br />The only real reason I don't give this movie a "5" is because of the ending. The ending kind of kills it, and exaggerates Vincent's ability, making him look like a Terminator. I am not gona go into details as to what it is that makes it exaggerating, but you will see what I mean. Another thing I would like to add is Tom Cruise's acting; it is by far his best in any of his movies. I have seen almost all of Tom's movies and I have to mention that this is the first time he has played a villain, and very well I might add...he should have won or at least been nominated for an award. Anyway, this is a must have by all movie aficionados.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ? OUT OF 5</p></body></html>

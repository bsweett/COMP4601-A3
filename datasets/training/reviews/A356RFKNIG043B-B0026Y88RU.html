<meta name="summary" content="Looks great but weak love story and graphic violence mar its intelligence"></head><body><p>3.4 stars<br /><br />There are many things to love about this movie, especially its McG visual quality, its occasionally classic dialogue, and its basic premise. But the insipid and drawn-out love story is out of place and slows things down pointlessly; the plot gets a little too labyrinthine for its own good (and ours); and the overly frequent, much too graphic violence seems to delight in itself to no point but distaste.<br /><br />There are some fine lines and solid performances (Freeman, Willis, Kingsley), but the two stars/love interests are good not great, and the script, which starts out very crisply, gets a little too clever and folds in on itself for no special reason other than it can.<br /><br />Add up all the pluses and minuses and you get a film that is excellent in spots but not quite as a whole. Still, if you revel in glossily done-up revenge (and a very nice blu-ray transfer), and enjoy not knowing what's really happening while it all happens in very tight, attractive shots, this could be your baby.</p></body></html>

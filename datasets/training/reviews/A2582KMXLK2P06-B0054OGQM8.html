I was a child from the 80's, and remember these movies well, and I also remember back in the day everyone thinking that the future would be exactly like this movie portrayed it to be like.  It wasn't, at least not *yet* in the year 2007 (in the movie, they go to the year 2015, so unless some major changes happen in the next eight years, all those flying vehicles and life-like television screens will probably not be happening in our reality any time soon).  It was just a lot of fun to sit there and think that back in the 80's, people really thought our world was going to change THAT drastically.  Lots of fun scenes.<br /><br />Anyway, I haven't seen the second movie in quite a long time, and was surprised that the quality of the storytelling has held up extremely well through the years, and the movie doesn't look like your typical 80's film either (you know, with lots of dated-sounding loud saxophone playing, yuck!)  I was also surprised that the characters actually went back to the year 1955 for quite a long time.  Talk about telling a story with lots of twists and turns.  Awesome!<br /><br />These are seriously some of the most exciting movies that have ever existed.  The first movie is a classic, and the third one is really good as well, even though many people point to the third movie as being the obvious weakpoint in the series.  Maybe, maybe not.  I don't really know.  I just know I love these films and wanted to comment on how well they've held up after all this time.  A series of movies that are worth watching over and over again, and I normally only watch movies once or twice.  Not in this case.</p></body></html>

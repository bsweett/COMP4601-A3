<meta name="summary" content="Great performances and fine directing.  It just didn't make sense."></head><body><p>I had never seen this 1980 film before because I generally avoid films dealing with the supernatural.  But now, more than 30 years later, I wanted to check out what this famous Stanley Kubrick film was all about.  Well, it sure is a horror film.  It held my interest throughout and kept me at the edge of my seat, waiting for the next surprise that this famous director had in store for the audience.<br /><br />The acting was exceptional.  Jack Nicolson and Shelly Duval star as a married couple with a six year old son who agree to be caretakers in an isolated luxury hotel during the winter months.  The child has an imaginary playmate and hears voices and sometimes he speaks nonsense in a grown-up adult voice.  Jack Nicolson seems like a well adjusted teacher who craves the isolation in order to write a book.  But he soon turns into a homicidal maniac.  His performance is nothing less than absolutely great and is certainly one that skyrocketed him to a fabulous career.  Shelly Duval is lesser known but I am surprised her name is not a household word.  She has unique looks with gigantic eyes that express the horrific conditions she is thrust into and I just couldn't take my eyes off her.<br /><br />Then there is the plot, of course, which was adapted from a Stephen King novel.  It is weird, twisting and held my interest throughout.  And yet it made no sense.  Frankly, to me, the movie was just a vehicle to watch Shelly Duval scream and Jack Nicolson gradually go insane.  Yes, the film was well crafted by one of the greats in the industry and the film has become a classic in every sense of the word.  However, my logical self yearned for a plot that made sense and a satisfactory conclusion.  But I guess that is just too much to ask for with this kind of film.</p></body></html>

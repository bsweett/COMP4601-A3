Will Farrell, Christina Applegate and all of the others do well in this film, but there just isn't that much to work with.<br /><br />The high point of the film is when Ron plays his Jazz flute in the club, that part was hilarious and my favorite part of the film. Like I said, there are a few other highlights, Ron throws a burrito out the window and hits biker Jack Black, and like when one of Ron's co-workers wears his sex panther cologne that smells like "a turd covered in burnt hair" among other things. These parts are hilarious!<br /><br />The soundtrack to the film is amazing; some of the best 70's music in one collection. Farrell and three other co-workers show off their singing ability by singing a version of "Afternoon Delight".<br /><br />Overall a good film, mainly for fans of Will Ferrell. If you like comedy movies that are what you see, this film is for you. If you want a deep story with a moral this ain't for you. Just fun, nothing more</p></body></html>

If more of the comedies I saw were half as good as this one, the percentage of comedies in my viewing regimen would skyrocket.<br /><br />(...) After a disasterous birthday party for the (...) Jenna, a wish she makes to be all grown up comes unexpectedly true as she wakes up the next day 17 years in the future (the current era instead of the 80s where the film started out) as a 30 year-old in a new city, with a new life.  She's living the kind of life she dreamed about as a kid, but apparantly has taken some paths to get there she wouldn't have expected: Jenna can't remember anything at all about the past 17 years.  Characters from her younger life are in different roles in her grown-up life than she would have expected as well; some that she would have thought would still be big parts of her life are absent, while people she never got along with are now her allies.<br /><br />  Jennifer Garner should have gotten an award for this; she plays the role of a character who's thirteen and thirty simultaneously to absolute perfection, and shows a tremendous comedic flair light years ahead of many higher-profile comedy movie mainstays.  It's in the top three or four films in the 'laugh-out-loud' category of the 2000s, is a brillant romance, and is more deeply moving and affecting than the vast majority of 'serious-minded' dramas.  A dream movie for romantic comedy fans; should appeal tremendously to all who enjoyed "Amelie", the 1980s's two "Mannequin" movies, "Soapdish" and "Serendipity".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What made the Hatter go mad?"></head><body><p>I am no great fan of Tim Burton's work. I find it tends to all be basically the same movie with slightly different costumes. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Edward Scissorhands and Batman Returns, for example, all felt very similar to me. In fact the only one of his movies I enjoy and want to see again and again is Ed Wood.<br /><br />Well, now to this list we can probably add Alice in Wonderland.<br /><br />The movie takes place some twelve years after the original story that most of us are familiar with from the Disney version. Alice, now 19 and on the verge of marriage, freaks out a bit and finds herself down the rabbit hole once more. She has no memory of having been here before, and all the folk she meets, like the White rabbit, the March Hare, the Doormouse and, of course, the Cheshire Cat and the Mad Hatter, aren't sure she is who she says she is. Well, the Hatter might be, but he's mad.<br /><br />All those worthys are engaged in a little light rebellion against the Red Queen (played by Helena Bohnam Carter, who appears to be channeling Miranda Richardson's Queen Elizabeth from Black Adder II), who sics the Bandersnatch and Jub Jub bird on anyone who challenges her authority. With the Knave of Hearts by her side, she wages a campaign of tough hate on the people of Wonderland as her sister, the White Queen, does frak-all but wait for Alice to turn up, obtain the Vorpal Blade and go snicker-snack on the Jabberwocky.<br /><br />If all this sounds a little on the mixed-up side, it is. The only thing we're really missing is an appearance by the Walrus and the Carpenter, and I'm surprised we didn't have them show up.<br /><br />But despite mixing in just about everything from Lewis Carrol's works, the film isn't muddled and stays surprisingly coherent. It's helped by some great performances (including Johnny Depp as the somewhat restrained Mad Hatter), and an incredible production design that uses some of the old-style illustrations of the characters to make them look very inhuman, particularly the Red Queen and the Tweedles.<br /><br />At no point was the movie boring and at no point did it fail to entertain. As an adult, I don't recommend seeing it on a Saturday afternoon, like I did, but rather suggest seeing it while all the little kiddies are in school. Also, since the theatre I go to still does not have 3-D capability, I had to see it in 2-D, so I can't say how it would look in the other format.<br /><br />But, yes, this was a film worth seeing, so kudos to Tim Burton and company! Oh, and for the record... they both have quills.</p></body></html>

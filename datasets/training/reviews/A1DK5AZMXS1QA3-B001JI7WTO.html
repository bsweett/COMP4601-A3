<meta name="summary" content="The best adaptation of the book so far"></head><body><p>I am a fan of science fiction, especially the classical kind of Jules Verne, H.G. Wells and other European authors of the pre-Hollywood era.  I've read many of these books, and have watched almost all the English-language movie adaptations of said books, and I will say that this is the best adaptation of Journey to the Center of the Earth produced by Hollywood so far.  This version is not as faithful to the book's plot as previous versions.  But as a movie, it is by far the best, for the following reasons.  First of, the special effects are great and very realistic, which is a required of any sci-fi movie these days.  Second, the action and dialogue were actually quite believable.  Brendan Fraser actually played a half-serious role, and the movie, though funny, was not ridiculous.  The other two characters; the boy and the lady, came across well, and were cast well.  Last, there were no outlandish scenes involving far-fetched technology, or some long-lost underground tribe of humans.  This made the movie very believable.  All in all, quite good, and probably Fraser's best action movie in the past several years.</p></body></html>

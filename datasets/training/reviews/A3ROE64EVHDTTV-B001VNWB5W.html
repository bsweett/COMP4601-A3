Richard Nixon remains president for several consecutive terms; America won the Vietnam war; the tensions between America and the USSR almost causes a full outbreak of thermonuclear war.  In the midst of all this, a group of masked heroes (who have been disbanded previously) investigates the murder of one of their own men.  One thing leads to another, building up to a climax that could bring about the end of humanity.<br /><br />The Good Things<br />*Video/sound quality was excellent in the theater, and should prove to be awesome when they put this on disc.<br />*The film has a fair amount of action and lots of interesting special effects, yet none of them ever really push the film over the edge like other superhero movies.  In fact, this film downplays much of the action to tell the story.<br />*The visual style is impressive.  There are some slow-motion effects, but not as many as I thought there would be.  Aside from the vivid special effects (which provides lots of memorable images), the photography is great.<br />*Production design is good; costumes and props are good, and the sets are great.  Look out for some motifs and some historical references.<br />*The story is very interesting.  It is very different from the usual comic-book films, and presents a lot of themes and ideas to really think about (for example, ideas about the savagery of human nature, and the state of society).<br />*The characters are excellent; a lot of time is spent on developing them, and by the end of the film, you can really understand them.  They are well-acted and well-written.<br />*Music is interesting.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*As noted above, the action is downplayed.  The first hour or so of the movie is spent developing the characters and showing the world that they live in.  Some people may be dissapointed if they were expecting more action, especially for a movie that runs over two and a half hours long.<br />*Not for kids; rated R for quite a few scenes with gnarly bloody violence, some sex scenes, nudity (including full male nudity...with the blue guy nonetheless), brutality, and thematic elements.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*The morality of this whole story is pretty messed up.  The "heroes" do a lot of wicked things, while the "villian" is righteous.  There is a deeper philosophical meaning to all this, and the story brings up some interesting ideas and questions.  But while much of it is thought-provoking and unique, some people may find it frustrating or just plain weird.<br /><br />In the movie, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) described the miracle of life as a paradox, relating to "turning air into gold," and that might as well be the paradigm of this whole movie.  It is a paradox, not only because this film was said to be "unfilmable," but because here we have a comic-boook hero movie without any real heroes; instead, the characters are morally ambiguous and live in a world that is close to annihilation.  Yet, despite all of the condemning views of humanity, the movie ends with hope.  These are just some of the thoughts that this movie throws out at you; it is a very thought-provoking story with some insightful characters.  At the same time, the movie has some awe-inspiring imagery, a few good action scenes, and a surprising amount of blood, guts, cursing, and sex.  This is definitely not the usual comic-book adaptation, but whether you love it or hate it, it may just stick with you and leave you thinking.</p></body></html>

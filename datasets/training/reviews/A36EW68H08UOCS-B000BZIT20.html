<meta name="summary" content="In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream..."></head><body><p>That tagline accompanied "you've-just-GOT-to-see-this-movie" word of mouth and brought millions of viewers into darkened cinemas in the summer of 1979 where Ridley Scott's Horrific Space movie scared the pants off us!<br /><br />While clearly paying homage to Hawks "Thing" and a whole generation of gotcha-thrillers, "Alien" made some indelible marks on the history of film - in particular on science-fiction thrillers.<br /><br />Scott follows the example of Spielberg in "Jaws" by giving us only brief intermittent glimpses of the horrific monster after taking time to establish characters that we identify with and don't particularly want to see eaten.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver would have had a notable film career if the Alien franchise were the only thing on her resume, and in Alien she is only part of a superb ensemble cast that includes John Hurt, Ian Holm, Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto and Veronica Cartwright.<br /><br />The skeleton of a plot should be well-known to even an "Alien" novice - a space cargo ship is returning with tons of iron ore when it is redirected to a planet where it picks up an extremely unwanted visitor.<br /><br />Fear and dread and tension build in the movie until it is as thick as pea soup.  Scott takes his time establishing the characters and the setting of the ship before unleashing the alien, and the deliberate pacing in the first hour pays great dividends as the shocks of the final two-thirds of the film escalate.  The movie contains many scenes so famous as to be icons in film history - consider Mel Brooks' parody Spaceballs, and I won't add anything discussing scenes such as the one around the dining table or Ian Holm's last scene.  But I would like to take a moment to praise the ending.  A plan is finally devised to blow up the entire ship - killing the alien as well - and making escape in a small shuttle.  The editing and pacing of this scene escalate the tension to our limits as the voice of the ship calmly announces at periodic intervals "5 minutes to ship destruction", etc.<br /><br />A thrilling roller-coaster ride of a movie.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

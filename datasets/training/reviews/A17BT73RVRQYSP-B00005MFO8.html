He builds the franchise well as Taylor the self-absorbed commander reduced to animal in a cage.  He plays the role well but has plenty of help.  Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall (one of the most underrated actors who have been)and Maurce Evans do their best to steal the show.  (Particularly Evans who's proves the screen presence of a great stage actor cuts through any amount of makeup.  The passion and interaction of the characters as they argue their cases mirrors the arguements of the times which is one of the movie's strengths.  Well shot and quite a spectacle considering the scale of the movie.  The franchise that follows never comes to this level and the amount of parody it has spawned doesn't cut it.  But this one is a winner.  It only remains to see if the remake can match it.</p></body></html>

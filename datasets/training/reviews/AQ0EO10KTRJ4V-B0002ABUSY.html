<meta name="summary" content="Starts great then fades into irritating editing"></head><body><p>A word to all Hollywood directors, editors and producers....... STOP USING THAT IRRITATING CHOP MOTION DIGITAL EDITING FOR ACTION SCENES !!!!<p>The new Dawn of the Dead remake started PERFECTLY with an opening that casts the proper sense of doom and rapidly escalating chaos.<br />At this point I was thinking... WOW finally a remake that is great and in some ways may even surpass the original.<p>Then as the film progresses, the inclusion of too many characters weakens the development and the movie begins to have a dragging feel that lessens your real interest or empathy for their plight.<p>However, the REAL thing that killed my enjoyment for this film was the last 1/3 of the movie where the final action and resolution starts kicking into motion.<p>The makers of the film chose to film this entire last 30% of the movie in that same irritating grainy, pixelated, choppy, skip frame, digital editing that I first remember seeing used in GLADIATOR'S opening battle scene.<p>Since GLADIATOR this style of action film editing seems to have become the trend for editors and directors to use.<br />It is supposed to introduce tension and energy but instead many people like myself find that instead it DETRACTS from the film as you really can't follow the action and it imparts a fake look to scenes.<br />When you use it non-stop for 30 minutes or so like in DAWN OF THE DEAD's final scenes it becomes downright annoying and removes any feelings of terror or suspense that had been developed in the earlier portion of the film.<p>Standard speed filming would have greatly improved the overall movie.<p>Attention Hollywood..... drop the choppy digital action editing trend..... it's not an effective visual tool..... just visually annoying to try and watch !!!</p></body></html>

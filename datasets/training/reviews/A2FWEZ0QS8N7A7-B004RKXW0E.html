<meta name="summary" content="Will Break Your Heart, but in a Good Way"></head><body><p>Anyone except a flexible rubber, hard plastic or plush toy without a heart should find themselves in tears more than once in this movie about just those kinds of toys who, after being outgrown for years by their owner, now face the prospect of that boy, Andy, going off to college and leaving them behind forever. As usual the Pixar animation is fabulous, the voice talent -- Tom Hanks, Wallace Shawn and others -- capture the, yes, hearts of the toys brilliantly, and there is at least as much fun for adults as for children.  In fact, for kids younger than five or so, some of the scenes will be very, very intense.  There are many wonderful lines, including "we do a lot of improv around here," and Ken telling the other toys at the pre-school that "I am not a girl's toy."  His fashion show for Barbie is a highlight.  Life for the toys in the Caterpillar Room of the pre-school captures exactly how it is to live with a two year old and the final scene does the same with the bittersweet moments of moving on.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This `Silence' is golden..."></head><body><p>`The Silence of the Lambs' is one of the most widely known and lauded films in recent years.  I say recent years because it's a 90's child and usually a film has to be 20+ years old before people start throwing the word classic around.  `The Silence of the Lambs' is, though, a classic.  It's that rare breed of film that elicits fear and dread as well as admiration, for the audience knows exactly what they are meant to feel and they embrace it wholeheartedly.<br /><br />`The Silence of the Lambs' revolves around a relationship between FBI trainee Clarice Starling and serial killer Hannibal `the cannibal' Lecter.  The fact that Clarice is looking for another serial killer still at large is really beside the point.  This movie is about Clarice and Hannibal, about their growing trust and their deep-seated emotional response to one another.  Hannibal is a horrifying man, a man who eats other humans, but Clarice is drawn to him in a way she cannot explain.  You can see this in her eyes, in the way she communicates with mere glances in his direction.  Clarice is scared and vulnerable and trying her hardest to prove herself in a field she feels less that comfortable with, but Hannibal sees something in her that excites him.  He sees a way that he can help her help herself and so he attacks her self esteem and her confidence, not in a malicious manner but in an attempt to better her.<br /><br />The fact does remain though that Clarice is using Hannibal.  She needs to find the killer Buffalo Bill; a man who kidnaps women, keeping them locked away for days while they moisturize their skin until he kills and skins them and then dumps their bodies.  He has just kidnapped yet another victim and so the clock is ticking for Clarice to unlock Hannibal's secrets in order to save a life.<br /><br />I have never been a fan of Jodie Foster.  I felt that she was effective in `The Accused' but aside from that she has never really bolstered in me a growing curiosity.  Same can be said for her performance here, which is just not as impressive to me as many make it out to be.  I don't think she should have won the Oscar, both Susan Sarandon and especially Geena Davis was better suited for Oscar gold.  Her performance though, is not bad, and so I can't downgrade it too much.  It sells what it needs to sell, but it just wasn't Oscar-worthy in my humble opinion.  Anthony Hopkins is another story all together.  His performance was iconic, practically flawless.  The ticks that he associated to Lecter are just mesmerizing, the way he sucks in his words when he speaks to emphasize the corruption surrounding his superior intellect is astounding in every way.<br /><br />Jonathan Demme brilliantly created a film that gets under your skin and stays in your head.  It's gritty and raw and takes your breath away scene after scene.  There isn't really a film in this genre that can compare.  As a horror film goes it succeeds in sending shivers down the spine.  As a psychological thriller is succeeds in molesting the demons in your head and as a drama is succeeds in creating an atmosphere of the purest form and delivering satisfaction all around the table.  There are few films that reach the emotional as well as physical depth of `The Silence of the Lambs', a film that truly deserves the unbridled commendation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fun at First, Then Tiresome"></head><body><p>I recommend Ultraviolet for a rental.  The sets are gorgeous and Milla Jovovich is easy on the eyes in her midriff-baring, tight leather outfits.  There are clever, original ideas for technology and weaponry.  The story is good and compelling for the first half.  Violet is a former nurse who contracted the "plague," a disease of the blood that gives the victim vampire-like characteristics.  No blood-drinking in this film; what a relief!  Like the X-Men, "hemophages" are fighting active persecution by the government.<br /><br />Violet has become a lethal assassin.  When asked to retrieve a case and not to open it, her feminine curiousity gets the better of her.  She finds the "secret weapon" she retrieved is a young boy.  Refusing to let him become a pawn in the blood wars, she simultaneously fights to unravel the mystery of where he came from, and to save his life.<br /><br />The film starts to go downhill as Violet, and the movie, lose their credulity, as she wipes out entire armies just because she is "pissed off."  As the villian says, "One woman against (insert number) of men?  Ridiculous."  Yes, it is, and the viewer quickly loses interest.<br /><br />Nevertheless, a good try from Kurt Wimmer and worth seeing once.</p></body></html>

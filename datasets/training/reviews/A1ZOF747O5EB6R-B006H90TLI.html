<meta name="summary" content="No Date Film"></head><body><p>The Coen brothers' films are nothing if not eclectic.  They range from the comedic to thrillers and a number of shades in between.  In the case of "No Country for Old Men", they are very much at the thriller end.<br /><br />The basic plot is that Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles across a scene of carnage whilst in the Texas backwoods hunting for antelope.  There are multiple bodies (both human and canine), a huge haul of drugs and a bag containing $2 million in bank notes.  Moss takes the notes and returns home before making the questionable decision of returning to the scene.  It is at this point that his life makes a decided turn for the worse.  He begins to be pursued by Chirgurh (Javier Bardem), who is surely one of the most relentless and chilling killers in modern cinema.  He will use any method to kill but his preferred means is the cattle gun using compressed air.  Need more be said?<br /><br />I was unable to count the number of murders in this film.  The squeamish at heart should think twice before seeing this movie.  It's certainly not the conventional date film.<br /><br />Yet for all its murder and mayhem, "No Country for Old Men" remains a compelling film.  The viewer is drawn into the web of destruction.  One further relating point is that the film contains no theme music at all.  Every scene is forced to rely upon its own internal force and persuasion to seize the attention of the viewer.  And it succeeds.  No mean feat!</p></body></html>

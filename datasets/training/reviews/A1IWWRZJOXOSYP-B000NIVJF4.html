His next (non-documentary) film is "State of Play" that stars Brad Pitt.  He does an excellent job with this film, bringing the horrific reign of Idi Amin to the screen with enough humor & humanity to make it watchable.  Jeremy Brock, who did the screenplays for Judy Dench's "Mrs. Brown" & Cate Blanchett's "Charlotte Gray," does a good job of adapting Giles Foden's novel into a workable film.<br /><br />This may well be Forest Whitaker's most memorable role, despite such excellent work as in the Clint Eastwood picture of Charlie Parker's life titled "Bird" for which he won the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival & in a lesser-known drama <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005QCVX">Ghost Dog - The Way of the Samurai</a>.  In addition to the Oscar for this film, he won similar awards from the British Academy Awards, the Golden Globe & film critics awards from Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, New York Film Critics + NY Online Critics, Oklahoma, Phoenix & Washington D.C.  Idi Amin is known as one of the most brutal dictators in modern history, joining Lenin, Hitler, Pol Pot & perhaps Sadam Hussein in that nefarious category.  In order for the film to work, Brock's screenplay had to show the various levels for the character, which Whitaker delivers with a cinematic payload.  We see the humor, the paranoia, the immaturity, the ruthlessness & the bravado of the character.  It is an amazing performance.<br /><br />James McAvoy, who had a small part in "Wimbledon" and played in "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch & the Wardrobe," plays the film's protagonist, Dr. Nicholas Garrin.  He's a young recent graduate trying to escape the esteemed shadow of his father in Scotland, which makes him decide to arrive in Uganda, where he is ignorant of the politics.  On one hand, it seems unbelievable that a character could graduate as a doctor and have such little maturity.  On the other hand, we watch TV's "Grey's Anatomy" & see varying levels of maturity among doctors.  McAvoy delivers a good performance as he grows up considerably before our eyes.  We learn to care about the character and wonder what the next chapter of his life might be like.  McAvoy will next be in "Becoming Jane," opposite Anne Hathaway as Jane Austen.<br /><br />Of the smaller roles, there are some standout performances.  Kerry Washington, who breezed through two "Fantastic Four" films, "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" & played Della Charles opposite Jamie Foxx in "Ray," plays Idi Amin's wife who is the mother of an epileptic child.  In caring for her child and in her position as "third wife," she is seduced by Dr. Garrigan and pays the price.<br /><br />Gillian Anderson, who will forever be known from her work on the TV show "X-Files," has a stunningly different blonde look and does a good job in this cameo.  Simon McBurney from "The Manchurian Candidate" & the upcoming "The Golden Compass," plays the disagreeable British diplomat Stone to perfection.  We really hate him, as we are supposed to do.  David Oyelowo's cameo part as Dr. Junju who is the conscience of the clinic does an excellent job.  Stephen Rwangyezi as Amin's assistant Jonah Wasswa does good work in a small part.  "The Last King of Scotland" is not always pleasant, but Whitaker's celebrated performance makes this essential viewing.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

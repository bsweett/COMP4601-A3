<meta name="summary" content="Eerie, foreboding remake"></head><body><p>A surprisingly effective remake of the 1976 occult thriller, "The Omen" is something of an improvement on the overrated original. For one, the acting is better. Liev Schreiber doesn't have Gregory Peck's dignified stoicism, but is more capable of expressing genuine fear and anguish, qualities more appropriate for a man who comes to realize he's playing daddy to the Antichrist. Julia Stiles is sympathetic as his wife, and Pete Postelthwaite is superb as the guilt-ridden priest determined to warn Schreiber of his son's true identity. And, in the role of the evil nanny, the casting of Mia Farrow, who unwittingly gave birth to Satan's son in the vastly superior "Rosemary's Baby," is inspired.<br /><br />Director John Moore provides a mood that's eerier and more foreboding than the original, and, predictably, lays on the gore in ways that weren't possible thirty years earlier. The suicide by hanging, the most disturbing moment in Richard Donner's original, is memorably restaged, while the impaling and beheading that shocked audiences in 1976 are more graphic. Those who can't get enough of this kind of stuff should be happy with the DVD "extras" which include extended versions of the most violent scenes.<br /><br />It's been years since I saw the original, so I don't recall if it included a poem foretelling the coming of the Antichrist, but whenever it was recited here, I wondered if someone was attempting to pay homage to 1941's "The Wolfman" ("Even a man who is pure at heart, and says his prayers by night...").<br /><br />Brian W.

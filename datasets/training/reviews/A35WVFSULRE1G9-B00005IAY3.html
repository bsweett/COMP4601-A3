Stephen wrote this and directed it. Dreyfuss is good, but a little to strong in his character. Melinda Dillon as the single mother who loses her son to the aliens is brilliant, so is Teri Garr. This film makes you think, can the government actually pull this off?...After seeing this, I believe it. The DTS version is incredible, the scene where Barry,(little boy), is abducted, is just out right crazy and loud.<br />  Dreyfuss,(a man on a mission), has had a close encounter, is out to find out where and why. Believe me, if this was you, you would have sleepless nights. Dialogue is good, FX, is incredible for 1977, and the soundtrack is FANTASTIC. Spielberg's 3rd feature film is a breakthrough, and one mans drive and vision of his childhood dreams. Spielberg is the man, and he was only 28 then, War of the Worlds basically relies on CGI effects, still fun, but this is the best(friendly) alien encounter film ever. Hope that didn't spoil anything. Entertaining, hands down, or up, if your reaching for the dark skys.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="wrong title - Studio vs Director"></head><body><p>Sorry, if you really are into the Alien and Predator movies, then I suggest you watch this on Cinemax (now running it and see if you want to buy it this version).  With the protracted and harmful battle between the director and, once again 20th Century Outfoxed winning to make it good for the kiddies, adults lose out.  So guess what will come down the road 6 months to a year from now?  AVP-Director's Cut (THANKFULLY).  I will wait to buy until then.<br /><br />Movie makers are going to have to learn that the under 16 crowd is the movie goers these days.  Movie theatres are used as a "babysitter".  But you CANNOT gear all movies to that audience and have to make choices that stop this dumbing-down of movies.  Why there are so many box office failures of late.<br /><br />So great premise, one we have waited for since Predator 2.  Shame that had to short change us in order to make it for the children's bucks.<br /><br />Wait for the Director's Cut Edition which will be coming shortly, I am sure.</p></body></html>

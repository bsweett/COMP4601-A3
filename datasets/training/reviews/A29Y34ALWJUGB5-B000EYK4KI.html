The only Pitt movies I liked were "Fight Club" and, because I'm a nerd for ancient history and mythology, Troy. Angelina is, on the other hand, notoriously bad at finding good movies to act in. The only movie I like, and this is self-explanatory, is Taking Lives. So, needless to say, I was skeptical of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. This was not even a purchase I made, but one of a family members. If not for Christmas, I wouldn't have touched this movie.<br /><br />Well, thank you Santa. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a surprisingly funny and action-packed movie. The movie never goes out of its way to force laughs, but kind of just lets it happen through implication and dry humor. The action itself, though it's very difficult to make an action movie in today's saturated market, is done with freshness, with car-chases and gun-fights and explosions galore. Nowhere is the action and comedy better than when Pitt and Jolie are together. It makes for some classic stuff.<br /><br />The story, if you don't already know, is of a married couple who are assassins-for-hire, though neither know that about each other in the beginning. They go about acting as a regular married couple, what with perfectly timed dinners, gettogethers with other couples, and those suburban vehicles. But on those occasions when a job comes, they are as proficient as killers could be, and go about their job professionally and with enough time to get back for dinner. Things twist, however, when they finally discover each others secret, and they must eliminate each other or else suffer elimination themselves.<br /><br />Like I said before, I'm not fond of either actor, but I am convinced that this movie couldn't have been done without these two. Pitt plays that same cool character he does in most of his movies, but it works here with the comedy as it kind of balances him out, makes him a bit more real. Angelina plays the tough-chick like no other high-powered actress (if you don't believe, try picturing Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta Jones, or Renee Zellweger in her spot).<br /><br />If you liked True Lies, this is a movie for you. If you like solid action (like what's in Desperado or Kill Bill), then I'd also recommend this movie for you. Also, if you are fans of Pitt or Jolie, as I'm slowly becoming, then go with Mr. and Mrs. Smith, because it is one of the finest movies, I think, either of them played a part in.</p></body></html>

The soty starts like any other movie but ends up tugging at your heart and making you fall in love with it's charactors. The story is about 2 oppoist sisters who get in a big fight and go diffrent ways. Camreon diaz dose a great job in her best preformance yet. The movie has some slow parts but mostly the movie is good. There is also amny almost teary moments between the sisters and the other characters. One of 2005 best films and it's one that you'll love.</p></body></html>

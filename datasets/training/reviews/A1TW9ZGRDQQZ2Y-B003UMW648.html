<meta name="summary" content="Average film in an average franchise"></head><body><p>I liked the first Narnia film to some extent and I kind of feel the same about Prince Caspian. These films don't have the wonder or magic that the Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings series have. In fact my favorite part of the Narnia movies are all the talking animals. I seem to care about them more than the humans. There are some good things (hence the 3 stars I gave it), such as, the outstanding CGI, a nice musical score and most of the actors are above average. I just have no desire to see more of the Narnia world in the future. It is better than The Golden Compass, so it's not all bad.</p></body></html>

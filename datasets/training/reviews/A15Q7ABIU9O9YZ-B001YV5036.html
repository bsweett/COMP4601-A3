<meta name="summary" content=""What are you fighting for?" "Milk.""></head><body><p>I just thought this was a great movie. Back in the mid-70's I was living in an apartment on the East Side of New York. I have the TV on with the Morning News show and the cerebral guy and the terminally cute "colleague." Gene Shallitt was reviewing "Rocky." I'm in the bathroom shaving but you can still hear Shallitt's New York 'youwantmustardwitdat' intonation. He said about Rocky, "it ain't about boxing."<br /><br />And likewise I would say that Ron Howard creates a perfect movie for the dignity of humans, the depression, the love of family, the promises made to children, second chances, self respect and loyalty. Whew. What a plateful.<br /><br />Howard gets criticized from time to time with the comment that he spoon feeds his audience. Hey. I just saw Oliver Stone's "Alexander" and I'm still trying to figure out what was the point? So if Ron Howard's going to spoon feed me, so what? He's the director. I'm neither Freud nor Einstein. I'm just a moviegoer.<br /><br />What I want to know is what marketing genius decided to release this as a 'summer film?' The audience you were releasing this film for then, sir or madam, continues to believe that "Dumb and Dumber" was the movie of the decade and they were robbed, man, at the oscars!!!<br /><br />I mean three brilliant actors, a complicated topic (whatever country is he talking about, dude?), and a boxxing movie. Where's Nicole and Reese? No cars. Where's Vin Diesel? No sex? No naked chicks?<br /><br />So, see this movie. Buy this movie. See it a second time. Be a guy and get just a little teary eyed. Excellent. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

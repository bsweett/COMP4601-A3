<meta name="summary" content="Electra Electrifies!"></head><body><p>I liked this movie. Being a 43-year-old male, looking at Jennifer Garner in red leather was a treat.<br /><br />But also, I thought she lent a solid, mysterious presense to the film. Rob Bowman directs another electrifying action movie. But like Reign of Fire, though cool and neat with solid special effects and actors, it comes somewhat short in some ways.<br /><br />But at least I wasn't bored. The look of the movie is very uncomicbook-like in the beautiful woods of British Columbia. I would purchase the DVD. A fun and different approach to a comic book adaptation.</p></body></html>

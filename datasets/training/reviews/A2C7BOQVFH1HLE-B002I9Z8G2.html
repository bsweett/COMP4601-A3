<meta name="summary" content="The Best Next Generation Movie Is Now In Blu-Ray!"></head><body><p>I have to own up up front that my favourite Star Trek series is TOS and while I did enjoy DS3 and the later seasons of Voyager a great deal somehow TNG didn't really do much for me.  Let's just say I'm much more excited about DS3 and Voyager coming in Blu-Ray than I am about TNG doing so.  With that out of the way, I have to say that I enjoyed this movie a lot and after Star Trek 6 this is now my favourite Star Trek movie.  I truly hope that the recent alternate universe version of Star Trek finds a new younger audience but the really bad science throughout i.e. the manufactured black hole made me totally disinterested in that movie early on and so if I had to choose just three Star Trek movies to take with me to a desert island they would be "The Undiscovered Country - Thearetical Release", "First Contact" and "Star Trek 1 - The Movie - Director's Cut".<br /><br />Regarding "First Contact", it looks great in 1080p and sounds good in Dolby TrueHD although I personally would have preferred a DTS-HD MA option.  Unlike too many other blu-ray releases, the BD-Live here is actually more than just a trailer of other movies to sell vehicle and I enjoyed the Star Trek IQ interactive quiz.  As for the content, we get a nice mixture of adventure and excitement as well as an homage to one of my favourite TOS episodes "Metamorphosis" where Cochrane is first introduced and a little drama with Picard which echoes another TOS episode "Obsession" as well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great Star Trek movie irrespective of series and both the picture and sound qualities are vastly improved over the standard dvd versions.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

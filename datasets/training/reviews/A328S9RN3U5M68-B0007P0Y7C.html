That being said, this vehicle for Jennifer Garner as the title comic book heroine is full of surprises.  Certainly none of the surprises are associated with the formulaic plot, a plot made worse with some mediocre script writing.  The pleasures are in the cinematography which detail elegant views of what appears to be the Pacific Northwest, in the presence of some very fine actors chronically underused (Terence Stamp, Colin Cunningham,  Goran Visnjic so memorable from THE DEEP END, and American Korean Will Yun Lee voted one of the world's most beautiful people in 2002), and in the nicely choreographed martial arts sequences which unfortunately are marred by victims swirling into sulfurous dust in demise.<br /><br />The story is simply Good versus Evil, the Good being Jennifer Garner's pouty-lipped Elektra, Terence Stamp's dignified mentor Stick, and father daughter team of Visnjic and Kirsten Prout and the Bad being the Hand of Asian guys headed by Roshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), Kirigi (the dashing Will Yun Lee), and some truly obnoxious creatures such as Tattoo (Chris Ackerman) whose body art comes to vivid life as various demons, and the well-named Typhoid (a truly awful Natassia Malthe) who is a parody of the entire comic genre.<br /><br />The thing that makes ELEKTRA work is the grounding of the film in natural settings instead of the usual hokey castles and dungeons replete with flying monsters and disintegrating planets. Though it will not make a believer out of those who have a low tolerance for the Marvel folk, it has its moments that satisfy the eye.  Grady Harp, May 2005</p></body></html>

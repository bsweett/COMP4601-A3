The roar of a lunatic's trusty chainsaw is worse still. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is a dark, deeply disturbed and dripping story of mindless torture, murder, and small town family life (in hell). Jessica Biel leads a hippy-van full of young folks into this twisted day / nightmare of unearthly sadism. Five innocent (well, ok, they are smuggling two lbs. of pot from mexico) kids on their way to see Lynyrd Skynyrd in Dallas are driving along, minding their own business, when they come across a girl wandering down the middle of the road. They simply must pick her up, so off they go, unaware that their plans are about to be changed drastically. The girl is dazed and traumatized, mumbling incoherently about death and doom. Do our five heroes listen to her warnings? Nah, they just figure she's a baked potato on acid. Then comes the first shock of the movie, when the girl pulls out a hidden weapon and turns it on herself. The first shock, but nowhere near the last! Biel and company must find a phone and call the law. Skynyrd will have to wait. Soon, R. Lee Ermy enters the picture as the not-so-helpful, loudly perverse sheriff of the small town. He is obviously dangerous and untrustworthy, with a violent undercurrent just beneath his skin. Little do we know, he is utterly evil to boot! Of course, we have Leatherface as well, that unhinged, misunderstood mountain of murder and mayhem. Oh yeah, and his chainsaw. The last hour of TCM is a relentless assault of carnage and insanity. We are given little context for the events. Like the victims, we get few explanations for the ordeal we find ourselves in. The simple fact is that these kids have stumbled into something they will never escape. Even if they survive physically, some part of them will not make it. Like Hooper's original, this update grabs us and forces us to watch as others suffer and die. It takes us into places we'd rather not imagine and that (we hope) don't exist.

<meta name="summary" content="Overall, tastefully done"></head><body><p>Overall, this movie was tastefully done. I heard an interview with daughter Roseanne and can understand why this would be very hard for the children to watch. No one likes seeing the light shined on their parent's moments of 'weakness', and both certainly had their struggles, but I think the characters brought out the love and tenderness of these two very wonderful people. We all have our faults, and the Cash legacy will live on not only through their music, but through their beautiful children as well. I hope everyone who watched the movie also has the opportunity to listen to the interviews of the Cash family memories as told from the heart by their daughters.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

It stands as David Lean's greatest cinematic achievement,and of the worthiest Oscar winners. For the most part, it's true to history about TE Lawrence, his exploits with the Arabs under the Ottoman Empire, and his personal struggles.<br /><br />Peter O'Toole is handsome&lanky as TE Lawrence (who,in real life,was rather dimunitive&homely) In the beginning, Lawrence is a bored officer in Egypt,working a desk job. His love of adventure gets him entangled in the liberation&unification of the Arabs. Alec Guinness is excellent as the sagely Prince Feisal, while Anthony Quinn is great as the stubborn tribal chieftain. Omar Sharif shines as Sharif Ali, Lawrence's friend, companion, and, knowing Lawrence's real-life inclinations, perhaps his lover. "Lawrence of Arabia" is a very masculine movie. It's not just because of Arab Muslim society, in which women are veiled&hidden. There's also the factor of Lawrence's homosexuality. The movie shows his two teenaged male companions,who may have been companions in an intimate sense. When Lawrence is brought before the Turkish bey (a slimy Jose Ferrer),the Turk strokes his bare,muscular chest. The movie hints at Lawrence's violation by the Turks. However, Lean doesn't show that after Lawrence returned to England, he had a male companion beat him on a regular basis. Lean is daring in hinting to Lawrence's queerness; the Production Code forbade ANY positive portrayal of gays. One can also say "Lawrence" is still revolutionary in portraying Arabs&Muslims as civilized&humane.<br /><br />"Lawrence of Arabia" is a majestic, marvelous film. The desert itself is a character, severe and pure. Maurice Jarre's soundtrack conveys the desert's beauty&power. The acting is superb. "Lawrence of Arabia" is an oasis in a desert of cheesy movies. It's a true classic.</p></body></html>

Obviously, I'm a huge fan of the original Fog and I saw this one at the theater; I hated it there, but somehow found myself buying it.  Since, I have come to really enjoying this movie, but not in its entirety.  I'm one of those who can watch select scenes of a movie and be very satisfied.  This is clearly one of those.  It gets progressively worse near the end, and that's unfortunate.  However, it has a lot of elements i really enjoy - a coastal movie, some decent horror (albeit not really scary), a lot of night scenes, etc.  So enjoy it for the few good scenes.</p></body></html>

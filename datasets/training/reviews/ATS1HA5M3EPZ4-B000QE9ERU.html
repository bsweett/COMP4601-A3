They also hated Daredevil.  Now, I will admit the transition of Punisher and Daredevil to the screen was not to be an earth shattering experience.  I mean c'mon, they were both released during weak times of the movie going season.  They were both second tier heroes of Marvel.  C'mon, they only spend a lot of money on the high profile characters like the XMEN, Spiderman, Hulk and the upcoming Fantastic Four.  I went to see this movie to support the Marvel Comic industry, I didn't think it looked that bad and I wasn't expecting much.  I was entertained to say the least.  Yes it was weak in some places but otherwise good.  Thomas Jane did a tremendous job playing the part.  He showed a finite difference between his initial character and the one that emerges from the horrible tragedy that he endures.  His family is brutally murdered in a vicious scene of gangland style shootings.  He survives, but comes out not quite himself, understandably.  The problem with the movie is that everything around him is not quite up to par with Thomas Jane's performance.  The tone of the movie is at times a little campy, and that just doesn't fly with this character.  He's dark, violent, gritty, obsessed and a little nuts.  Think of Batman with just guns, no gadgets and no desire to keep his identity secret.  Unfortunately, the whole `make friends with the off center neighbors' thing doesn't work with someone who is supposed to be a loner and makes things a little awkward.  And even though Travolta plays his character seriously, he's still a bit over the top.  What does work with Jane's performance is the intelligent manner in which he 'Punishes' the bad guys.  Die Hard fans of the comic might say this is in contrast with the character who goes in guns blazing and kills everyone.  But the alteration is a sign of the times and how this character actually changed in comics.  Hopefully with Jane's performance, this franchise won't die.  As of now, a lot can be done, and it could be done well if given to the right creators.  If anyone thinks this version is worse then the Dolph Lungren version, they need to rethink their perspective.<br /><br />Update 10/13/2005:  I watched the making of documentary on this movie and I found it amazing that the director/writer was given a 30 million dollar budget and a 60 day shooting schedule.  That's an abomination.  Considering the other movies Marvel has made, they didn't put much into this one, and it most likely contributed to it's less than stellar end product.  Kudos to the director for doing what he did though.</p></body></html>

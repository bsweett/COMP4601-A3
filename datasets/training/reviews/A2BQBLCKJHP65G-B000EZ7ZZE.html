<meta name="summary" content="A Great Deal On The Modern Day Zombie Franchise Of Resident Evil."></head><body><p>For those who haven't seen probably the most successful adaptation of a video game to live-action film franchise, you might get a kick out of Resident Evil. Starring Milla Jovovich as Alice, a chief security officer for Raccoon City's Umbrella Corporation. Within Umbrella's secret lab called The Hive, a deadly T-Virus accidently gets released, turning most living things into blood-thirsty zombies. Alice, with strange implanted memories haunting her as well, must find a way to stop the virus with a group of various similarly heroic characters, ending up with one last battle with a very large super mutant in end's way.<br /><br />Sound like a video game? Well both the first and second chapter here at times plays out like one, even though minus a few established characters, the storyline here veers off the original plot laid out by Capcom's original playable ones. But to the moderate, and even the more dedicated ones like myself, Resident Evil is a decent addition into Zombiedom. Of course it's not going to surpass original works like 80's Italian fare or George Romero's original trilogy (even though he was rumored to direct/write the first installment, only to be turned away), but there has been worse Zombie films and Jovovich does do a good job playing the lead.<br /><br />As for this new re-release combo of the first two films, I was expecting the cheap way out with maybe the original '02 release one discer of the first movie packaged with the Disc One of the sequel. But surprisingly that's not the case. The discs in this set are a brand new piece, with Disc One having BOTH movies on the same DVD-9 single sided, dual layer disc. This was very cool, with a brand new menu with one movie per layer, with only two audio tracks (5.1 English/French). You'd expect that the bitrate would be very low for these movies, but since this was re-encoded in 2007, both movie's rate seem very high, and picture looking superb for SD. As for the second disc, it's a mixed bag. If you were expecting all the bonus features from the 2 Disc individual releases, forget it. Since this release was made just to promote the theatrical release of the third film, '07's somewhat disapointing Extinction, they mostly deal with sneak peeks of it. However, there are a few extras outside of Number Three, but they all deal with Apocalypse, so no behind-the-scenes of the original, not to mention the films themselves are missing their commentaries from those as well. There is a neat trivia game on Disc Two with some pretty hardcore questions on Apocalypse, but they could have easily given us more than what they did.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great way to get the first two films at a good price if all you're really looking for is the movies and a morsel of extras. As I write this, it's been a year since this was released and I doubt it will be in print for much longer due to Extinction now old news on DVD. But if you don't own the first two films and have interest in modern-day Zombies I'd suggest picking it up cheap, then if you really, really like the films, spend the extra buck and buy the extensive 2 Disc versions and with Extinction, or wait for a possible complete boxset in the future.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:8.0/10)</p></body></html>

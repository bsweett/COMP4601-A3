If you are not familiar with the story I will only say that to give away any details of this movie would be inappropriate. A BEAUTIFUL MIND is slow, lethargic yet remains intriguing and emerges into a heartfelt statement about our true selves and the meaning of love, commitment and the essence of mind and being. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly give brilliantly realistic performances and make this film work. A lot also has to be said of James Horner's insightful and moving score, which only enhances the viewer's insight and response to the film's statement.  This film is beautiful and one of the best to come out this year.</p></body></html>

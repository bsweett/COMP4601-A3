<meta name="summary" content="A Movie That Holds Itself "Hostage""></head><body><p>"Hostage" puts Bruce Willis back in the action movies after his "Whole Nine Yards" and its sequel. But maybe Willis would have been better off if the movie was never made.<br /><br /> "Hostage" is really an inept piece of work that showed great promise but soon just becomes a barrage of action sequences that seem more implausible by the minute.<br /><br /> Willis plays Jeff Talley a hostage negotiator who lives in L.A. The movie opens with Talley on the job trying to talk a husband out of killing his son and wife, who has been cheating on him. When snipers say they have a clear shot of the man Talley calls them off holding a sign that reads "no one will get killed today" thus setting up Willis' character as a good honest cop who really cares about these people. As the situation goes on Talley loses control and all three are killed. Talley takes this hard especially when the boy dies in his arms.<br /><br /> The movie than fastforwards 12 years later and now Talley is no longer a negotiator but is sheriff of a small county and is having problems with his wife and daughter, played in the movie by Willis' actually daughter. The daughter, Amanda (Rumer Willis) thinks her parents are going to get a divorce. And even though the parents protest, secretly I think they feel the same way.<br /><br /> Right now I suppose the movie sounds entertaining. And it is but that is only because we think the movie is going to focus on Willis and reveal more of these demons in his closet.<br /><br /> Kevin Pollack plays Walter Smith, who wife has died and now takes care of his two children, Tommy (Jimmy Bennett) and Jennifer (Michelle Horn). As they drive home three young boys see Jennifer. One of them then gets the idea to follow the girl to her home and steal their car. Apparently this is what the three boys, played by Ben Foster, Jonathan Tucker, and Marshall Allman, do for kicks.<br /><br /> Once the boys break in and hold the family hostage after a series of mishaps occur, for instance, none of the boys thought of the police showing up the movie hits the tone that will be played through-out.<br /><br /> The movie was directed by Florent Siri and written by Doug Richardson. I'm not familiar with either. I will say this though Siri does give the movie some style. Notice the slow motion action scenes. It seems like someone has been watching Sam Peckinpah's movies. But little else is offered to this movie. The writting at times is sloppy. Characters say such ridiculous things with a straight face. Simple lines like "I'm the man" are said with great dramatic impact. Are you kidding me?<br /><br /> But after the first hostage situation the movie has what it feels is a twist. Now Talley is called back on the case after he calls the F.B.I. to take control of the case because his family is now being held hostage unless he can get a DVD of Ernst Lubitsch's "Heaven Can Wait". And it is not wanted as a rental. There is some sort of important information, what I don't know, it is not all very clearly explained, on the DVD that the bad guys just have to get. I suppose though what is on the disc doesn't matter. Hitchcock would play around with this. What the villians wanted in the movie wasn't so important but the actions they took to get the information was. So Talley has to go inside the house and get the DVD or his family will be killed.<br /><br /> Now Talley must face his fears after things went so wrong with the boy 12 years earlier and finds himself in the same situation.<br /><br /> As I watched the movie I thought why did the director and the writer chose "Heaven Can Wait"? It must have been done for a reason. After a while I though maybe the connection between the two movies is this; In "Heaven Can Wait" a man is sent to Hell where he is confronted with his past sins. In "Hostage" Jeff Talley must also confront his past demons. Other than that I can't think of anything else.<br /><br /> "Hostage" for all of its action is really a pretty boring picture. Once the movie started to focus more on the action and less on the characters I found myself tunning out every now and then. The movie started off as a character study of Talley and then just abandons everything for action. Why? They were starting off so well. But what are we going to do. Here is a perfect example of why Hollywood has been losing money lately as attendance is a recent lows. People simply aren't going out to see movies anymore because we don't wnat to see movies like "Hostage". Why should I pay 10 dollars to goes see junk like this when I can rent it for half the price or even wait for it to play on TV? This is why of weeks Hollywood is losing out. They don't realize we are sick of their movies. But go ahead Hollywood keep making these movies and losing money. It merely shows how out of touch you are with the public.  * 1\2 out of *****<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Promising but ultimately inept movie that is a barrage of action sequences and very little human interest.</p></body></html>

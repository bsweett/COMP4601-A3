<meta name="summary" content="A classic!"></head><body><p>This movie scared me as a kid! It was a really old movie then but will always be a classic. Sure the special effects are cheesy, the sets look funny and the acting is laughable at times but for some reason this movie is just COOL! It's the type of scary which leaves a lot to the imagination which makes it all the more frightening. It's about a crew of men in space who's ship gets stranded on a planet inhabited by a man, Morbius and his beautiful daughter Alterra. The planet was once home to a race known as the Krell who dissapeared and left behind their mysterious brain enhancing technology. My favorite part is when the 'monster' melts through the solid metal door and all the alarms are going off, talk about suspense! Something about the sound of the alarms wailing in the background and the door turning red hot was REALLY frightening. It was totally freaky! It's not a bloody or violent film compared to movies of today but it scares you on a much deeper level, proving that OUR MIND can be a greater enemy than any monster. This movie was ahead of it's time. It's a movie that is good for a wide range, both young and old and was made in a time when movies were smart and made you think and were more than just a money machine cranked out by greedy studios!</p></body></html>

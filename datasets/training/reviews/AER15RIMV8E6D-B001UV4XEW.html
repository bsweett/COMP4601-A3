<meta name="summary" content="Extremely Funny!!!"></head><body><p>This movie is incredibly hilarious and had a great storyline with great actors! That baby was adorable. Doug is going to be married in two days, so his friends Phil, Stu, and Alan take him to Vegas for his bachelor party. The next day, they wake up and can't remember anything about the night before, find a baby, and can't find Doug. They get into crazy misadventures trying to figure out what happened, arrested by the police, figure out who the baby belongs to, and try to find their friend before the wedding. I highly recommend THE HANGOVER!!!</p></body></html>

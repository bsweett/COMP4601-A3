<meta name="summary" content="GREAT ACTORS, GOOD PLOT, GOOD MOVIE!!"></head><body><p>everything is good, ethan hawke is a nice actor, laurence fishburne is a great man. his acting is real and he gives you a lot more than you bargained for. excellent job, drea de matteo, ja rule, john leguizamo crazy vato loco. seems to bring that bit of spice in just about any movie his in. talented and doesn't hold back, the action, the suspense, the whole thing. the criminals, the bad guys, and the cops, the good guys, or are they? this gave me my action fill, good has to unite with the bad to make it through. they're held up in this police station. kind of like hostages because the bad, or is it good, guys won't let them escape with their lives. all hell breaks loose and these criminals have to learn how to get along with these cops in order to find a way out before the nights over. i really recommend it.</p></body></html>

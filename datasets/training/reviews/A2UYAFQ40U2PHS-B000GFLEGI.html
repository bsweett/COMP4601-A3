<meta name="summary" content="A great film by George A. Romero, unfairly trashed, and deserving of reappraisal..."></head><body><p>I had read many negative reviews of this film (by horror film junkies and longtime Romero fans), so I wasn't expecting much.  Lo and behold not only is this a very good film, but it's a worthy follow up to all of Romero's dead films.  Perhaps many people were disappointed by this film because Romero took the Dead films in a different direction here.  He didn't make a nostalgic film or anything like that.  He made a very vivid, bleak, unforgiving, gory (warning for gorehounds...the gore is not "fun" gore), and intense.  I think it's an excellent film.  It's occasionally heavy handed (Hopper's character is obviously a stand-in for the Bush administration, which Romero admits in the commentary), but it's extremely watchable and a worthy entry into the zombie series.  It also has some of the best acting of the entire series.  Simon Baker and John Leguziamo are superb here, playing characters that seem like real people instead of horror film characters.  Asia Argento, daugher of Dario and longtime friend of the Romero family, isn't really given anything to do here.  She's nice to look at, but that's about it.<br /><br />There are many memorable scenes here, especially the shot where the zombies cross the river.  It's reminiscent of a shot in Herk Harvey's Carnival of Souls (a film Romero saw when it came out and that he deeply admired), except this time it's in color and there's CGI used in it (very good CGI).  All of the performances here are very sincere, and that helps a lot.  There's no tongue in cheekness here.  Romero takes a very somber tone with this film and keeps it until the end.  I think it's one of his best films.  It's not as good as Dawn (my favorite) or Night, but it's better than Day of the Dead (which is very underrated in my opinion) and it deserves to be talked about in the same breath as Romero's other works.</p></body></html>

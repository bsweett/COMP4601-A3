I think it's already a good sign when a film doesn't leave everybody indifferent. Actually I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand I liked "Oldboy" for being rather unusual, on the other - there were many complex things difficult for comprehension. Partly because the storyline is intricate, and partly because of asian mentality which is sometimes rather sophisticated (at least for me).<br /><br />The plot is flawless and that's a very good thing, because you don't have to say to yourself all the time: "That's not possible, I'm not buying it". There were some things and characters' actions that seemed unmotivated, but again I tend to explain it with mentalities distinctions, I don't think those were the plot holes.<br /><br />Anyway even if you are not going to like "Oldboy" you'll have to admit the film is different. Some say it reminds "Ichi the Killer" (which I haven't seen), to me it seemed reminiscent of "Memento", they share the same mood of despair and gloominess.<br /><br />"Oldboy" is very stylish and well-crafted, every scene and every shot look like they're on their place, it's very elaborate and beautiful (although there are many violent moments). Many scenes became instantly famous among cinephiles, like the corridor fight scene, that lasts several minutes and is done with one take. Especially I'd like to mention brilliant music which is the third part (or even the half) of film's success.<br /><br />I'm sure I'm going to watch "Oldboy" for the second time to clear certain things out, but after the first viewing I was left with the impression of something fresh and innovative, which appeares rather often lately when watching asian (and Korean in particular) movies. For one thing I'm sure, you won't get bored, if you decide to see this.</p></body></html>

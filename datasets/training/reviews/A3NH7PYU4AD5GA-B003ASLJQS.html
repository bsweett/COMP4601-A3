<meta name="summary" content="Clint Eastwood's masterpiece"></head><body><p>With a superb plot about the interrelated lives of three childhood friends, this movie has the emotional depth of classic Greek drama. The plot combines story lines over 25 years, of kidnapping and child abuse, armed robberies, betrayal, revenge, jealousy and murder in a completely convincing and thoroughly constructed script. I have watched it three times and am fully convinced that there are absolutely no holes in the story. Every single aspect of it is thought through and in line with the whole.<br />Yes, there is violence in the story, but does that make the movie a violent "show", as one review claims? Definitely not, much of the violence happens off screen or is not shown in a full and direct way. There is no violence peeping, no gloating in sordid details. Violence here is funtional and not overdone.<br />The actors are top notch, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins fully deserved their acting Oscars. The rest of the cast is on the same level, mainly Kevin Bacon, Lawrence Fishburn, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Lynney. The directing is superb, Clint E. would have deserved a directing Oscar.<br />The movie, in my view, tells the story better than Dennis Lehane's novel. Apologies to the author, whom I respect a lot for his Boston crime fiction.</p></body></html>

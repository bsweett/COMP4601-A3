Jack Aubrey who commands the HMS Surprise to patrol the South Atlantic in search of the Acheron, an elusive French warship that is larger, faster, and has more cannon decks. Russell Crowe's bold command is often challenged by his friend and ship's surgeon played by Paul Bettany.<br /><br /> The film is mostly accurate as to details on sailing vessels of the 19th century as well as the types of tasks sailors had to undertake. The film shows that sailors were not only hoisting sails on ships but that each ship had specialists on board to tend to various matters: carpenters, blacksmiths, tailors, cooks, soldiers, etc. The film also accurately captures what tactics and battle conditions would have been like during that period of time. The only inaccuracy is where one ship is in pursuit of the other and the ship in front is blowing smoke: if one pays attention, one will see the smoke blowing back against the wind and towards the ship in pursuit. This presents a physical impossibility as the smoke would have to be blowing in the same direction as the wind and not against it.<br /><br /> Despite some technical inaccuracies, the film is exquisite in every way. The film is has good character development and the plot is well paced; I didn't feel the time pass. The film is rated PG-13 but the violence is not so light as to make it childish. I strongly recommend seeing this movie on the big screen.</p></body></html>

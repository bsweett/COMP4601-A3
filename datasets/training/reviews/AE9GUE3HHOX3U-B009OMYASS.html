I guess I witnessed something deeper than what alot of other people saw in "Hostel".  It's not your average horror flick where you want all the characters to die and get it good.  By the time things went "south" in "Hostel", I sort of "cared" about the 3 tourists guys and the 2 Japanese tourist girls.  This film touches a primal nerve in anyone who is human, if you feel deeply about humanity and all that stuff. I did not expect "Hostel" to become an evil, witchy, and sadistic film (which it did, and took it's sweet time about it).  There was a realness I haven't quite seen captured in horror films and I don't know how they did it.  Maybe because "Hostel" flips the script on you, and taps into human fraility and vulnerablity which we all possess.  It exploits all of our weaknesses.  There was an understated sadness throughout the film, you could sort of see it in the characters eyes.  You  feel disconnected and lost when they are in Amsterdam and even more disarrayed when they make the journey to the hostel from hell.  It was eirie and surreal when they arrive there and just got more bizarre and disheartening as the film went along.  Alot of people say it wasn't bloody or gory enough.  I think the psychological mind f*@#$ is worse than  typical movie FX.  They show just enough to make you crawl inside your own skin and want to die there. I have never in all my life had to literally hit the stop button and end a movie out of pure "fear" or "sickness".  I had to turn it off after the white guy got it.  Unfortunately,  I have yet to see the rest of the film but have heard alot through hearsay.  After I turned it off, I paced around my house for an hour and sort of began having mild "panic attacks".  I ended up having to wake up my roomate and explain what was happening.  Since then I have calmed down but I still intend to watch the rest of it.  I would like to say I absolutely hated "Hostel", but instead I have to say this film literally did what no other film has done to me.  It made me think about it days afterwards.  I would like to say the director and ALL of the actors did an incredible job.  They made this film beyond memorable, so good for them. In hindsight,  leave it to Quintin Tarantino again for involving himself in brilliant filmaking.</p></body></html>

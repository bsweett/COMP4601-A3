<meta name="summary" content="ENGROSSING!!  Predator done justice!!"></head><body><p>I had a great time watching Alien Vs. Predator.<br /><br />I went in to the movie sceptic. PG-13? How can they do an Alien/Predator movie without the R-rated violence?<br /><br />I'll tell you what though, this movie was engrossing from beginning to end. The violence is there, but it's mostly Alien and Predator violence and it was very sharply done. Frightening. Fast. The violence was done in the tradition of old style hollywood and was very effectively done with sound effects.<br /><br />The story is well thought out and gives a marvelous new look inside the world of the Predator!! Where they came from. What they're about. Successfully blending their world with the Aliens and demanding your attention as the events unfold between the two sides and the unexpecting humans in the middle.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to anybody who has seen the Alien or Predator movies. In fact, I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't. I left the movie theatre smiling and talking. Also, knowing a little more about Bishop (the andriod from ALIENS).<br /><br />Go see!! What are you waiting for!!</p></body></html>

Action figures, puzzles, guns, masks; we had it all.  Unfortunately, we had to rely on the scheduling whims of network executives in order to watch the actual films that spawned this kitschy bonanza.  The Age of Cable, VHS and DVD has dawned, and now we have the movies to enjoy whenever we want to time travel to a world where apes dominate.  It's a decidedly downbeat and pessimistic world, but one that continues to fascinate. <p> And this DVD set contains the entire 5-film series, so you can watch the devolution from highly-original concept into low-budget mediocrity.  Fortunately, though, the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; franchise was almost always entertaining, even as inspiration ran low.  Let's look at the films in order, shall we?  Set controls for the year 3978... or 3955, depending on the movie. <p> Planet of the Apes:  The original, which over the years, has picked up some only marginally justified camp baggage.  Charlton Heston plays a misanthropic astronaut who, ironically, becomes humanity's sole defender.  Maurice Evans persecutes him as orangutan Dr. Zaius (who knows more about ape history than he lets on), and Roddy McDowall (soon to become synonymous with playing chimps on-screen) and Kim Hunter (and Oscar winner for &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;!) portray Cornelius and Zira, his chimpanzee defenders.  With the lovely, fur-bikinied Linda Harrison as Nova, Heston's mute main squeeze.  A genuinely thought-provoking and thrilling classic, despite a few heavy-handed attempts at humor.  Worthy of special note is Jerry Goldsmith's dynamic, percussive score. <p> Beneath the Planet of the Apes:  The bizarre, somewhat inferior, sequel, which suffers from a lower budget (witness the really poor ape masks on the extras, and a few gorilla soldiers in flimsy outfits).  James Franciscus crashes to earth to find Heston, and instead finds Ms. Harrison and the apes.  Everyone's back from the first except McDowall (this is the only ape film he missed).  As a special bonus, James Gregory (&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;) plays a war-hungry gorilla general with gusto.  Features some interesting vistas of a bombed-out New York, and a memorable mutant unmasking scene.  A veritable camp-fest, and a lot of psychedelic fun. <p> Escape from the Planet of the Apes:  An inversion of the original concept, and quite a bit closer to Pierre Boulle's original novel.  McDowall returns, and with Kim Hunter and Sal Mineo (&quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;), journeys back to the present day United States, only to run afoul of a sinister government scientist.  Vivacious performances by McDowall and Hunter salvage it somewhat. <p> Conquest of the Planet of the Apes:  A more violent entry in the series, but tame by today's standards.  McDowall plays his own character's son, a chimp named Caesar who is destined to overthrow humanity.  And that's pretty much what he does.  Ricardo Montalban performs admirably, but the series was beginning to fray with lower and lower budgets.  The final visuals will chill you, though. <p> Battle for the Planet of the Apes:  The final film.  McDowall attempts to divine the future, but invites the wrath of disenfranchised humans.  A miniscule budget (evidenced mainly in the final, underwhelming battle scenes) devastates this one, although the script's not too bad.  Claude Akins makes a fine villainous gorilla, diminutive singer/songwriter Paul Williams has some memorable lines as a wise orangutan, and director John Huston portrays the legendary Lawgiver in the framing sequences.  Award yourself a banana if you can spot &quot;Animal House&quot; director John Landis as one of the humans. <p> The complete DVD set includes a 2-hour documentary, hosted by Roddy McDowall himself.  It's fun for the serious &quot;Apes&quot; fan.  It features a lot of trivia, and talking head interviews with the major players, including Heston, make up artist John Chambers, and producer Richard Zanuck.</p></body></html>

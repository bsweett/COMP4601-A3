<meta name="summary" content="THE INTENSE, INTRIGUING MYSTERY OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR"></head><body><p>If there's any justice in the world, this movie is bound to sweep the 2004 Oscars. What a brilliant, haunting masterpiece from Clint Eastwood, easily his career's magnum opus as an auteur. <p>To begin my paean, this is not your average police procedural mystery. It is a mystery about human behavior, about these men, their pasts, their relationships with women, and their world (the men are brought together by a murder.) It is only about their relationships with one another as those relationships are colored by external events. As such, this is safe territory for a "guy movie" that plumbs deep emotion without feeling anything too personal. It's a story about what Real Men dream of doing, and how it feels when the dreams become real. It is difficult to address any issue in the plot without unraveling the tapestry Helgeland weaves in his screenplay. I can say that this film is full of disturbing moments, sucker-punches, and palpable anguish.<p>While the theme is not out of this world, in fact all these actors have been in a congruent role in some part of their careers, it is nevertheless chock-full of stunning performances. It may actually be a must-see for the acting alone. <p>Sean Penn nearly resembles Robert DeNiro from "Once Upon A Time In America." Kevin Bacon has matured and for the first time in many years, turns in a performance that is both dark and sympathetic. Marcia Gay Harden plays haunted better than anyone, although we don't see a great deal of range from her in this film. Tim Robbins was perhaps too obvious a choice in his role, but he delivers exactly what "Jacob's Ladder" and "Arlington Road" showed he could do before. He chews a bit of scenery, but always when it's called for.<p>Eastwood directs like a man of passion, in love with his actors and his scenery, employing long takes and two-shots to give the story a sense of real time that is too often avoided by younger directors in favor of interesting angles. <p>5/5 for the performances, screenplay and Eastwood's steady hand. But 1 point reluctantly deducted for a somewhat indulgent pace and the frequently out-of-place background score (really, it could have been more cheerful!)<p>All said and done, you just have to see this one.</p></body></html>

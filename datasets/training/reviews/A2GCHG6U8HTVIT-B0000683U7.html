<meta name="summary" content="First-rate Hitchcock, Plus Grant And Mason"></head><body><p>It's one of my favorite Hitchcock movies, even if the plot makes less sense than usual. There's nice chemistry between Grant and Saint; the set pieces are unusual, especially the crop dusting; Grant's mom, Jessie Royce Landis, has sardonic style and it's pleasant to realize that they were both born in the same year. Leonard (Martin Landau) with a crush on Mason is also great. The train through the tunnel at the end is an excellent example of how Hitchcock could be naughty without being explicit.<br /><br />Most of all, in my view, Hitchcock and Grant have a worthy adversary in James Mason. The guy was a superb actor, a genuine heavy weight, and he brings such style and menace to the part. I think he easily matches Grant in the suave department.</p></body></html>

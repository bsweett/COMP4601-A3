Though the filmmakers have changed many settings, the basic plot line remains the same, which is about a mystical exchange of letters between a man and a woman. The point is, the man, Alex (Keanu Reeves) lives in the year 2004 while the woman, Kate (Sandra Bullock), lives in 2006.<br /><br />This is a love story, and a very romantic one. The communication between Alex and Kate, which gradually develops into rapport, or something more, is carried out through a time-traveling mail-box standing before the curious glass house by the lake. Like `Somewhere in Time' or `Frequency' you need suspension of disbelief to enjoy the story, which looks less plausible in a modernized city of Chicago than in a seaside house in Korea.<br /><br />The script is skillfully written so as not to make us realize the implausibility of the film's situations, and though some (or many) would notice where the story is going at the earlier stage, the film all in all succeeds in keeping us guessing: `Can they meet each other?' The chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock is a genuine one even though we know their `conversation' is physically impossible and there is one romantic scene that is accompanied with an equally romantic Paul McCartney song. And the reference to one Jane Austen novel is clever and intelligent.<br /><br />`The Lake House' is a wildly romantic film and is impressive as such. Still, the sub-plot about the shaky relations between Alex and his father (Christopher Plummer) fails to interest us. Actually no supporting actors, even Shohreh Aghdashlook, are memorable, but you know this film is made for Keanu and Sandra. And I referred to the `implausible' plot, but implausibility didn't bother me. Still I'm afraid the idea of moving the location to Chicago is not a good one because the two-year lapse does not seem a big difficulty to overcome with this background. (Alex, why not e-mail instead of waiting?)</p></body></html>

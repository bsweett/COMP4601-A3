The film had its moments of effective film making. The concept of "28 Days Later," however, is golden. Like George Romero's zombie flicks, the storyline of an incurable virus turning those infected into ravenous zombie-like murderers that is quarantined within the main British isle, is so ripe for possible sequels and spin-offs. As expected, a sequel is made --- grossly entitled "28 Weeks Later" (a sequel would probably be entitled 28 months or years later). It's not directed by Boyle but by director Juan Carlos Fresnadilla.<br /><br />You spot the differences immediately between these two directors. The film opens with Robert Carlyle and Catherine McCormack holed up in a cottage out in the British countryside. They're preparing a meal and discussing the fate of their kids as they traveled away for vacation just before the outbreak. Their dinner is interrupted by a young boy that has fled from a pack of infected that included his parents trying to kill him. This line of dialogue sets up the film's main theme: reconnection. It's not as eye-catching as Boyle's opening where he had then-newcomer Cillian Murphy alone inside a hospital room, and the moment he steps out of the hospital, an eerily empty London embraces his newly-recovered senses. Fresnadillo clearly doesn't want to dillydally and doesn't see the value of establishment. He throws us the facts right away, clearly banking on his audience's familiarity with Boyle's original work, and takes us straight to the action. A few minutes later, the survivors are in distress.<br /><br />If Fresnadillo's concern is to create a film that is more visceral, more gruesome, more violent than its predecessor, he certainly achieved it. However, I think Fresnadillo belongs to that school of filmmaking wherein cameras are supposed to be in a state of perpetual motion, and a shot should not last more than 2 seconds. The film is edited erratically, and the camera movements are unbearably jerky, that it's almost impossible to tell who's biting who, who's escaping from whom, and so on which was plain torture.<br /><br />It's quite unfortunate that the film suffers from a tired aesthetic style (I would've preferred Boyle who despite his MTV-tendencies still knows when to stop and just enjoy that moment of serenity). The story actually has good moments. Sure, there are certain instances wherein the characters start losing a hold on common sense or logic, but as a sequel to a film that draws its powers from a ridiculous idea to begin with, the writers didn't do that bad. London 28 weeks later looks like a more affluent Baghdad --- surrounded by Americans who are armed and have their own protocols. "28 Weeks Later" exploits that idea slightly through out this film. The themes do not have the philosophical underpinnings or the sophistication of Romero's zombie parables. The allusions are quite plainly mere metaphors that manage to distract me from the film's want of visual quality. That's when I start to miss Boyle who, with all his faults as a filmmaker, still manage to churn out new things and ideas from concepts primarily borrowed from masters of the genre, leaving this movie scary one way but forgettable in the other.</p></body></html>

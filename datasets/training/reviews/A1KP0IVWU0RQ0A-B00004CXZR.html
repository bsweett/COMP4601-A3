<meta name="summary" content="so it's a little slow,it's still star trek and it's not that bad!"></head><body><p>over the years many people have fought over this movie,and to be sure this isn't the best star trek movie made,but really it's not that bad!<br /><br />  after the end of it's five year mission, the enterprise is being refitted and the crew is gettting her ready for her new launch.while this is going on,we see(a very good opening piece) three klingon war ships and the "cloud" which they are attacking.very quickly we see that the "battle" is onesided and the klingons are defeated,all of which is seen by a federation listening post. flash to earth and james kirk as he takes commannd of the ship once again,because if not stoped the "cloud" will reach earth very soon!<br /><br />  while not the slam bang action of say star wars or even buck rogers,this thiking mans sci-fi tale is good and if the story is a little weak,you still get the cast back together and start the movies off with a bang!<br /><br />  the two disc dvd is great with both the movie version and the directors cut,plus more extras than you can shake a stick at,so enjoy and live long and prosper!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Will give you the creeps"></head><body><p>I HIGHLY recommend that if you haven't seen this movie, then go and rent a copy, or get it dead cheap. My mouth was open with disbelief & shock throughout most of the movie, and I was certainly getting shivers up my spine, the creeps, the works basically!!! I suggest if you haven't gone digital yet, go!!! Although, despite me having a digital camera, I get them developed online, so I can put them in a photo album. I just wouldn't go and hand in a film at somewhere local now. Believe me, once you see this movie you won't be either. Digital is great in more than ways than one, and this film will definitely make you rush out and get a digital camera!<br /><br />What also gave me the creeps was Robin Williams's excellently portrayed character, Sy, in this. Moving away from his "family-friendly" characters he's played in the past, this will have you longing for Hook or Mrs Doubtfire. Strangely enough, he plays a creepy character really, REALLY well!!! I wouldn't have expected it before seeing this. What he wears also adds to the character. And then there his hair, which is really cropped, and dyed a sandy colour. Horrible but suits the character. Because of his extremely hairy body (ugh) Robin had to shave most of his arms, upper chest and hands for this movie.<br /><br />The film focuses on a lonely photo-developing guy called "Sy, the Photo Guy". He quickly becomes obsessed with this young family, the Yorkins. Connie Nielsen plays Nina, the mum, Will is played by Michael Vartan and their kid Jake (Dylan Smith). His obsessions include practically memorising their address, buying the same book Nina is reading, visiting their house (and something even creepier happens here, which will have you wondering exactly what happened), and keeping an extra set of prints of their photos for himself. The film snowballs from here, keeping you in shock most of the movie, and almost feeling like you need to have a good, long, hard scrub in the shower afterwards.<br /><br />This movie is well written, and well shot, I can't find fault with it at all. The plot is well laid out - even the money shot of all the pictures on the wall is played out while we're distracted by a joke from the Simpsons on TV. (The episode is Cape Fear, the second episode of season 5.) Robin Williams quite literally becomes Sy Parish, and you'll go through different feelings towards his character, but by the end, although a little confusing (and most people will NOT get it, judging by some of the reviews), will return Sy Parish to the Robin Williams we know & love. The ending is left hanging, after a nail biting finale, and it's kind of like Lost In Translation, you're not quite sure what happens. The final moments will kinda ruin things, with Sy giving a reason why he did what he did. There was no need to give a reason. Everyone feels protective of people, and that's exactly what Sy was trying to do. It wasn't so much a mistake as unnecessary to have Sy tell the police (but mainly the audience) about his childhood, "explaining" his subsequent behaviour by letting us know he was abused as a child, all too neatly adding that his father used to take photos of him doing degrading things. This was just added in for no reason, and most people will question it.<br /><br />I bet the cast & crew had great fun with this movie, with all the photos prominently displayed in the scenes. I bet they were sick of being in front of the camera after this! I also loved the little segment, which actually showed you how Sy went about developing the photos. Although probably not all true, for me, it brought back some bad memories of being locked in a tiny dark room at college, trying to break open the canister to get the negatives out, which promptly turned purple when I tried to get them developed. It looks an interesting - although could be boring after a while - job, and in preparation for his role, Robin trained for two and a half days at a photo developing training facility in Southern California on an Agfa MSC 101-D photo developing machine.<br /><br />I strongly recommend everybody sees this movie, although sit on your hands if you're a nail biter, and don't look into the ending too much - it'll just ruin the movie for you.</p></body></html>

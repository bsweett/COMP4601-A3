<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie."></head><body><p>I have not read the book or seen the older movie. But this Scarface film is the most popular. Great movie. It's about how Tony Mantana, ScarFace becomes from a poor politicul pirsoner,to a rich popwerful Mofia boss, to his death. I really like how it's about the rise and fall of a man. Great film.</p></body></html>

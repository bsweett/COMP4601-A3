It is one of those rare movies that is both frolicking fun and an epic classic.  How much of the movie is true or revisionism doesn't matter as much as how they use true elements to frame the enigma of Mozart's persona and genius.<br /><br />There are two stories really:  The main story is about Mozart (Tom Hulce), but it is told by an aged Solieri (F. Murray Abraham), Mozart's envious nemesis, at an asylum where a priest comes to hear his confession.  Bitter about life, Solieri rails against God Himself for feeling scorned by the eclipse of Mozart's talent.  Every time we leave the narrative into the flashbacks of Solieri's telling recount, we often are shattered as we come back to the cell with the sympathetic but perturbed priest--so absorbing is the story.  Amadeus is reckless and playful.  Having a wealthy father who scorns his son's frivolousness, Amadeus evaporates his monetary resources through wine, women, and song.  For the latter he only squanders through his venue.  For if he weren't such a serious composer and gave lessons, he wouldn't be in such a financial bind.  Considered an eccentric, he is, nevertheless, hired by the Emperor of Austria, to be a court composer in Vienna.  Solieri, an admirer of Mozart, has a big hand to play, for he is in charge of all the court music.  In the company of two other Italian composers, Solieri outnumbers and outpowers Amadeus in many ways.  Solieri has a plot by which he thinks by vanquishing Mozart, he will perversely reek revenge on God.<br /><br />'Amadeus' encompasses the genius of its subject matter.  With eight Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Abraham, it is one of the greatest films assembled.  The craftsmanship is marvelous.  Neville Mariner's score makes the whole experience worthwhile by itself.  Elizabeth Berridge's portrayal as Mozart's wife yields are sympathy, and Tom Hulce makes the whole affair an entertaining romp.  Even the priest frames our interest with his facial expressions, accentuating the audiences' horror and fascination.  Not to mention the scenery and costumes that have a splendour of their own.  After almost twenty-five years, 'Amadeus' is an untarnished jewel for the eyes, ears, and heart.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Seriously Unconventional"></head><body><p>YES!  This film is unusual--it breaks out of conventional time and space reality--maybe that's its main gift.  The idea is terrific---what it's like to spend 15 minutes being someone else---in this case a famous and succesful movie actor.  The choice of actor fits in with the general motif---John Malkovich---who is, I think most people would agree--a little off-center, himself.  They didn't chose Tom Cruise (now that would be interesting) or Robert Redford or Brad Pitt....but John Malkovich..??!<br /><br /> It could have developed into something really illuminating.  (like The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind)  But it dropped the ball somewhere and ended up being just a mess. The idea of the old people needing Malkovich's body was grotesque...and then the idea of using the child's body was even worse.  (shades of Rosemary's Baby)<br /><br />It's essentially a heartless movie...no one really cares about anyone besides himself, with the possible exception of the Cameron Diaz character who, at least, cares about her animals.  The John Cuzak character, our "hero" is likable at first, as the hapless puppeteer, but he doesn't lose a moment to go after the snazzy new lady at work (Catherine Keener).  No one grew, no one learned anything, and, at the end I really didn't care about any of them, least of all, John Malkovich.<br /><br />If you're really impressed by the fact that this is unconventional, and a lot of reviewers here are....then you may love this.  Love?  A funny word for such a loveless story.<br /><br />My DVD gave me the treat of an interview with Spike Jonze, who pulls over the car to vomit.  I guess this is supposed to be really really funny...<br /><br />The reason I gave it any stars at all was for the originality of the concept, and the excellent cast.  It was great to see Mary Kay Place again (and Orson Bean!!)  Cameron Diaz was very good and Catherine Keener was terrific.</p></body></html>

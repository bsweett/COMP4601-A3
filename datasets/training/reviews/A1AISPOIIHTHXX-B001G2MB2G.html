<meta name="summary" content="It's a kind of (flawed) magic"></head><body><p>One of the things that I always liked about the Harry Potter book series was Rowling's writing, since, while at times simplistic and not as detailed as other fantasy writers, she was able to make it more accessible and reader-friendly as opposed to Tolkien who's one of the more clinical writers and very, shall we say, "scholarly" in his writing? However, I found the 5th book, the Order of the Phoenix, the most trying to read since the length didn't translate to pacing and Harry's caps lock-laden outbursts were quite annoying. So while we have the shortest movie based on one of the longest books, it's quite successful at the adapting of it...most of the time.<br /><br />Year 4 ended with Harry Potter being witness to Voldemort's resurrection and upon returning, the Ministry of Magic has been renouncing him and Dumbledore by saving they're all lies. With wizards disappearing and adults who don't want to include him despite his needed involvement, Harry finds the 5th year with an incredibly troublesome teacher, and having to teach his classmates how to protect themselves at what's coming.<br /><br />As far as plot progression goes, Order of the Phoenix is the least advancing of the stories so far since we do find out some things but, with knowledge of how the books end, they're not as substantial and it's the latter books that are the most plot heavy. But the main issue regarding Phoenix is that it's a bit too jumpy with many scenes getting at most a couple of scenes before we're off somewhere. For example, in the book when Harry arrives at 12 Grimmauld Place, the book gives us time to settle in and gives some breathing time; here it's a couple of scenes before we're off to Harry's hearing. While yes, the book does cut out some excess, it does so with almost breakneck pace as if someone was timed and had to get in as much as they could before the buzzer rang.<br /><br />However, the actors are more confident in the roles with several big name British actors such as Imelda Staunton nailing the perfect Umbridge as well as Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman and Michael Gambon still doing fine work. And while castmates Rupert Grint and Emma Watson feel even more<br />"supporting character mode" than ever, Daniel Radcliffe does a good job at doing that frustration of being too old to shrug off responsibility while being too young to ignore it without being a big crybaby like he was in the books (man I wanted to smack him when I was reading). The scene stealer is Evanna Lynch who probably does the perfect Luna Lovegood and the book's best new character was thankfully the best cast as well.<br /><br />With its exciting finale complete with some of the best effect work the series has had (but Grawp, the big giant is bad; not Scorpion King bad but still), the film may not be the best Potter but it's still an enjoyable watch anyway.</p></body></html>

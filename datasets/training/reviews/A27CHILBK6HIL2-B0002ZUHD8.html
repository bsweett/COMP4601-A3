<meta name="summary" content="Bad Execution Results In Pure Hollywood, Zimmer Saves It."></head><body><p>MOVIE: A film that could have been a lot more interesting if the approach was better.  Here we have the true story of King Arthur who fought for Rome and Britian, a man who wanted nothing more than freedom for his men.  Sound familiar?  It should, because the whole freedom thing has been done too many times, but that's not what makes this potential epic a dud.  Also this claims to be thr true untold story of King Arthur, when in reality the historical accuracy is rather poor.  The movie doesn't go into detail about what the heck is going on during these such as Braveheart did. I found the acting and the set design to hurt this movie the most.  The battle scenes were incredible in my opinion, and I thought they were well done.  The ice scene is nice, and the ending battle through the smoke was incredible, but it was the acting and the sets that hurt the movie the most.  Clive Owen and Kiera Nightley did fine jobs, but the rest of the cast was horrible.  The acting was so stiff and wooden, it just felt too tense.  I found myself wanting the actors to stop trying to act and just let it flow, but that didn't happen.  Then comes the set design, everything looked so fake and that brought down the effect.  The armour looked like plastic, and some of the costumes looked like something out of a high school play.  Even the wall that was built to keep the woads and saxons out looked cheaply done.  The colors on some of the costumes were way too bright, and that was in contrast to the dreary, foggy, green landscape of the location.  By having these bright shiny knights riding through the foggy green fields it makes the costumes and landscape look fake.  Everything had the look of something brand new and not gritty, rusty, or blood soaked.  Otherwise this movie could have been amazing, but now it's just enjoyable.  If Hans Zimmer didn't compose the score I probably would have not found this movie so exciting, but his thrilling score is what makes it enjoyable.<br /><br />VIDEO: The unrated disc comes in a 2.35:1 widescreen transfer and it is decent.  The colors come out nicely even though that is the downside of the movie.  But the snow scenes are a visual feast for HDTV owners.<br /><br />AUDIO:  The Dolby 5.1 mix is clear and crisp but rather weak in my opinion.  Nothing exceptional except for the ice battle and the smoke battle at the end.<br /><br />PACKAGING / EXTRAS:  The single unrated disc comes in an armary case with snap latches on the side identical to many Universal releases (We get rid of WB snapper cases, now we get these, ugh).  The case also has a cardboard slipcase, which has no purpose whatsoever except to attract attention of the consumer as they wander through the DVD aisles of their local stores. This unrated edition has 13 minutes of added footage, which basically makes the battle scenes more violent. The extras are pretty basic.  You get a 17 minute making of featurette, and I was happy to see that they gave Hans Zimmer a little screen time in discussing the score, unlike in Tears of the Sun, where he got none.  Then there is a 15 minute discussion that includes Bruckheimer, Fuqua, Owen, Knightley, and some other actors.  I thought it was pretty good, but it also seemed like fluff.  There is an alternate ending that was cut due it not being recieved with open arms from test screenings.  For XBOX owners you have a playable demo of the King Arthur game, and to top it off there is a feature that pops up fun facts of the production as you watch the movie.  Pretty basic, but better than most discs.</p></body></html>

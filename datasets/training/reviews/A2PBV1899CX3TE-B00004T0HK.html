<meta name="summary" content="The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched"></head><body><p>American History X is a powerful film about a controversial and disturbing subject: racism in America. Edward Norton plays the part of Derek Vinyard, who is an intelligent young man who falls into the skinhead neo Nazi lifestyle in Venice Beach, California. Stacey Keach plays Cameron Alexander, a white supremacist based on Tom Metzger, and Avery Brooks plays Dr. Bob Sweeney, a black high school teacher who reaches out to his students, both Black and White, to try to get them to turn away from gangs, hatred, and violence.<br /><br />Edward Furlong plays Daniel Vinyard, the younger brother of Derek, who also gets involved in the neo Nazi skinhead lifestyle once his brother Derek is sent to prison. Derek shoots and murders some Black car jackers who are stealing his truck, but goes over the line in his zealotry, and is sent to prison. While in prison, he rejects racism, and when he gets out, he tries to prevent his younger brother Danny from making the same mistakes as he. But it is not that easy, it is not like a Country Club that you can just quit and walk away from.<br /><br />Finally, director Tony Kaye wanted his name removed and sued the film company for damages. Edward Norton edited the film, and gave himself a bigger role, according to Kaye, and they fell out over artistic differences. I think that the final product was very good, and I don't see why Tony Kaye didn't want to be associated with it. The film I saw was well directed and covered a very controversial subject remarkably well. I guess it is just that the subject creates very strong feelings, and it is difficult to come to an agreement about how best to convey the proper politically correct line. It was almost one of those "directed by Alan Smithee' situations, but one of the stipulations of using that pseudonym is that you don't discuss your dissatisfaction with the project in public, and Tony Kaye had already taken out ads in Variety that aired his dirty laundry and complaints.<br /><br />FILMS AND ROLES OF EDWARD NORTON<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLPK">Frida</a> (2002) ....

Now having seen the whole movie, I can understand (and appreciate) the various things that have been referred to in pop culture, such as sleeping with the fishes, the horse's head, and what have you. When I saw these being referred to, I did know they were from the Godfather, but now, seeing the source material makes me appreciate them all the more, and I can see why this movie was such a hit back in the day.<br /><br />Marlon Brando made an excellent Vito Corleone, and the character is also respectable because he does not merely go on bloody rampages, he is calm and logical, willing to discuss things first and solve a problem peacefully before he has to resort to violence. The supporting cast is also excellent - Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and James Caan also played their characters well. I can not give this movie any less than five stars, and would give it ten if I could.</p></body></html>

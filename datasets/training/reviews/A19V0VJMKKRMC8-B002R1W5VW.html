<meta name="summary" content="fantastic"></head><body><p>when i first saw this movie i didn't understand it. now i understand it and i have to say it's fantastic. nicholas cage pulls this movie off. sam rockwell is just in for the ride but like in confessions of a dangerous mind he had a very good performance.it's a colorful quirkly and darkly humnorous film.</p></body></html>

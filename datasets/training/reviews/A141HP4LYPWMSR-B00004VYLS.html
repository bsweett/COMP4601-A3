While the Superman series fiercely clung to a high degree of light-hearted comedy throughout, 'Batman' presented a dark, grim world for Bruce Wayne to defend. While the villianous Joker (Jack Nickelson) was a comedic villian in his own right his was a more modern up-to-date black comedy that caused one to both laugh and cringe at the same time.<br /><br />A great beginning for the Batman series that would spawn three sequels. Study the background scenery of Gotham City and you'll see just how much Burton's vision has influenced the genre for decades to come.<br /><br />Cast includes: Kim Basinger, Jack Palance and Michael Gough as Alfred the butler. I don't think I would have picked Michael Keaton to play Batman, but he was indeed up to the task. Highly Recommended!</p></body></html>

Average everywhere else."></head><body><p>"Gangs of New York" will sit amongst "Donnie Brasco" and "Casino" in the modern male film library, in the not-quite-great category. There are great things in this movie," enough for some wishful critics to declare it one of the best films of the year. But the it's either too long or too short, depending on how you look at it; it's the kind of film, quite frankly, that should have been two films. As it is, the movie is 2 1/2 hours and it still feels painfully rushed. You can sense director Martin Scorsese wanting to linger, but feeling the pressure to keep his oversized story on the move. It just isn't quite the work the master's fully capable of -- it could be, in fact, one of his most uneven directions ever.<p>There is one incredible thing in the movie, and that is Daniel Day-Lewis, who swallows whole the character of Bill The Butcher, the criminal boss who runs the Five Points neighborhood in 1861 New York. Day-Lewis is a beast; he could stalk DeNiro's shadow any day of the week. Bill is a brilliant, emotionally ravaged monster -- a Jack the Ripper type, really -- with only his sense of honor and his enjoyment of power to stave off his enraged impulses; his moods are held together by the thinnest of threads. <p>Not so good is Leonardo DiCaprio, who simply lacks the toughs for a role like this. He looks like a model posing as a middle-of-the-century meany; on certain occasions, he rises to imbue his Amsterdam with shades of greatness, but not enough. You just can't buy the kid as a reasonable adversary to Bill. I'm not sure what young actor might have succeeded -- Colin Farrell, maybe? -- but DiCaprio is too much a movie star to ball up his fists convincingly. <p>Cameron Diaz, similarly, is miscast. Nope, not her in this movie, as a young pickpocket who must choose to stay loyal to Bill or love Amsterdam. Not enough fire. Diaz, at best, is emotionally unstable, a la "Vanilla Sky." But gritty? Huh uh. Too much "prim" in her "prim-lookin star gazer."<p>Scorsese tears the movie in too many directions. The final battle sequence is incredible, but a lot of viewers aren't really going to understand it. Scorsese never paints the broad strokes of a new America honing in on Five Points very well; a lot of people I saw the movie with thought the ending was a mistake. Actually, it's rather well-conceived thematically -- the government using the guns the gangs swore to keep at home -- and the images are outstanding, but its connections to the larger scope of the film remains on the page. Here we were, screwin around with all this gang nonsense, when all that was going on outside the Five Points? The ending is cool, but it feels like an intrusion we didn't want.<p>You see my point for two movies. The first, obviously would have ended with the first battle for the Five Points, which could have freed up the second movie to focus more on the growing America. As it is, jamming it all into one film, with some jarring edits, makes for an incomplete film experience; I fear "Gangs of New York" was slightly doomed in conception. it's a testament to the talent of the parties involved, especially Day-Lewis, that the movie nonetheless feels spectacular in parts.</p></body></html>

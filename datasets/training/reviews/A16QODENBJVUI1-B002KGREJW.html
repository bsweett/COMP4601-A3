<meta name="summary" content="One of the finest indie comedies of the past couple of years"></head><body><p>This is one of the finest low budget indie comedies you are ever likely to see and the finest I have seen since NAPOLEON DYNAMITE.  For a "small" film this one has a surprisingly strong cast and I would love to know how the producers managed to get so many fine individuals together for this project.  There is no star of the film, but an ensemble cast in which each performer has to carry his or her weight.  Probably the hottest performer in the film at the moment is Steve Carell, who here plays a suicidal Proust scholar and former professor who is grieving over losing a grad student he was in love with to another Proust scholar.  Anyone going to see the film hoping to see Carell as he was in THE 40-YEAR OLD VIRGIN is going to be crushed, but those open to something unexpected will be delighted.  The very gifted Toni Collette, who does her usual fine job as the mother in an exceptionally dysfunctional family, plays his sister.  "Dysfunctional" might actually be a weak term, since "chaotic" might be better.  Most of the film turns around the attempt to get her daughter Olive to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California, a long drive via Volkswagen bus from their home in New Mexico.  One of the joys of the film is Abigail Breslin's performance as Olive, who while cute as a button is not traditional beauty pageant material.  Many will remember her from SIGNS as Mel Gibson's young daughter.  Greg Kinnear, a rather harried motivational speaker who hopes to achieve great success through his 9-Step plan to become a winner, plays her father.  Alan Arkin plays his father in an absolutely hysterical performance as the lewd, vulgar, and unselfconscious heroin-sniffing grandfather.  Rounding out the family is Dwayne, played wonderfully by Paul Dano.  In the preview that I saw, Dano may have been responsible for many of the loudest laughs from the audience.  Dwayne is a hostilely independent teen who has taken a vow of silence until he manages to get into the Air Force Academy to pursue his dream of becoming a test pilot.  When his uncle Frank (Carell) asks him if he has many friends Dwayne scribbles on a notepad, "I hate everybody," then takes time to underline "everybody" after Frank reads the note.<br /><br />The ordeals the family experiences are all original and exceedingly funny.  I won't spoil the adventure by recounting them, but I was struck throughout by how original the humor was.  Virtually none of the humor was recycled or flat.  There are a host of great scenes that any viewer will remember vividly.<br /><br />After another summer of mind-numbing films that attempt to be blockbusters but only manage to depress, this film will be a tonic.  A long time ago Hollywood seemed to forget that more often than not less is more.  While this is a "small" film, it manages to be infinitely funnier than any of its larger-budgeted competitors.  It could also quite possibly end up the funniest movie of 2006.<br /><br />I did have one quibble with the film.  I thought the last few minutes were a bit of a disappointment.  Without revealing precisely what happened, I thought the reactions of all the characters were a bit hard to buy.  But apart from that, this is an utterly delightful and very funny movie.</p></body></html>

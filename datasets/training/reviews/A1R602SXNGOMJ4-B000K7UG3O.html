<meta name="summary" content="A Fun, Offbeat Romantic Comedy"></head><body><p>Every actor in this cast, including Terry Bradshaw, a former football player, is fantastic.<br /><br />In fact, why can Terry Bradshaw, a former football player, act better than professional Hollywood writers can write? This script is a mess. Scenes are short and borderline incoherent, or so dumb as to be targeted at an audience too young to care about romance. What's the point of putting goofy scenes, like the fake bird fake CPR scene, a scene that every seven year old in the audience will wake up for, in an alleged "romantic" comedy? There's no romance here. None. Zero. Zip. How do you put two such beautiful, sexy, charismatic actors -- Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker -- in a movie, and yet have absolutely zero romance or heat or sexual chemistry in the movie? I mean, you'd really have to be trying to make a movie this erotically neutered with two such stars.<br /><br />Nothing here makes much of any sense at all. The scenes are a jumble of failed ideas quickly abandoned. The direction and editing are nil.<br /><br />A few scenes are ridiculous and childish. Matthew McConaughey is repeatedly attacked by wild animals. These scenes just never take off.<br /><br />A few scenes are painful.<br /><br />And a few scenes are just plain bizarre, as if they came from another movie.<br /><br />This is such a shame. The actors were up for it, but the script writers and director gave them nothing to work with.</p></body></html>

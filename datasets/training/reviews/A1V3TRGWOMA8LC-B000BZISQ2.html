The special effects are decent, the action sequences memorable, and it's not too long.<br /><br />The problem with Terminator 3 is that the first two set the bar so high that it fails as a successor in the franchise. The plot is a rehash of the second one, the female Terminator is a joke (although nice to look at, plot holes abound, and it just so feels so ...  underwhelming.<br /><br />Of course, the first two are legendary so expectations are high. Once Fox has danced all over the grave of quality with The Terminator Chronicles being released soon, maybe T3 will look like the best movie of the decade.</p></body></html>

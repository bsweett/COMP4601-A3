<meta name="summary" content="Gangster Tale Falls Short"></head><body><p>This film is an enigma to me.  It has all the elements of a great film yet ultimately it has no resonance for me.  Tom Hanks is excellent as the hitman on the run from his former employers.  Paul Newman, in the twilight of a great career, is even better as the mob boss.  The few scenes that Hanks and Newman share are pure cinematic dynamite.  Tyler Hoechlin as Hanks' young son is a natural.  Jude Law delivers another good character performance as the hired gun/free-lance photographer.  In smaller roles Daniel Craig, Dylan Baker, and Stanley Tucci also do good work.  The direction by Sam Mendes is crisp and the story moves pretty good.  The art direction and the cinematography are breathtaking.  I think ultimately why this film fails to achieve greatness is that at it's heart it is a cold one.  Despite the efforts of the top-notch talent in front of the camera and behind it they cannot muster enough empathy for a story that involves heartless gangsters.  These criticisms aside, the film is worth checking out for all the things that do work.  This film is a disappointment, not a failure.</p></body></html>

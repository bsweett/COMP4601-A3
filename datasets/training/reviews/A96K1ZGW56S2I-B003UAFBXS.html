He's working as an autobody repairman in a small town outside of Mobile, Alababma.  He's runs a small airport in southern Alaska and gives flyover tours of the state. He bags groceries at a small grocery store in Montana, is married, and has 13 children. He works as a limo chauffer in Hollywood. He's impersonating himself in Vegas. Some Elvis fans just can't accept the fact the Elvis Presley, America's only real King of Music, is dead.  Of course, some people still have a hard time believing that John F. Kennedy died. There's all kinds of stories that the assasination was just a huge government cover-up for a massive conspiracy, either extraterrestial or otherwise.  Kennedy was young, handsome, and sauve. He came from a prominent family and was married to a beautiful wife. He was the youngest person ever elected President of the United States and also the youngest to die. Elvis and JFK are the closest individuals that America has ever had to royalty.  But what if some of the conspiracy theories were true?<br /><br />That possibilty is the foundation for BUBBA HO-TEP.  Most simply put, the movie is an Elvis redemption story. The film opens with Elvis lying in his bed at a retirement home in Mud Creek, Texas. He's got cancer on his penis and not too much longer to live. He ended up in Mud Creek because thirty years earlier, he pulled a Prince and the Pauper with a look alike out in Nevada. The King needed to get away for awhile and get back in touch with the simpler things in life.  The only problem was that the look alike was a druggy and died before they had the chance to switch back. Things got even worse several years later while the King was performing a tribute concert to himself and he pulled his hip out of wack on stage. He never was able to recover and without any friends or family he could call on, he eventually found himself living in the Shady Rest retirement home in Mud Creek, Texas.<br /><br />As time passes by, Elvis begins to realize that there's something fishy going on at Shady Rest. Turns out there's a mummy living around the home who can suck human souls. The mummy needs the souls to survive. A young soul would bring him completely back to life, but there aren't any young souls at Shady Rest. So, Bubba Ho-Tep, lives like a virus, sucking out a soul whenever he needs to and no one is the wiser. Except the King and JFK.<br /><br />That's right JFK.  John Kennedy is the newest resident of Shady Rest. He's in a wheelchair, has a hole in his head that he claims is filled with sand, and is black.  He tells Elvis that the government died him black to keep him in hiding. The story sounds far fetched, but Kennedy knows an awful lot about JFK and he really does have a hole in his head.  Anyway, Elvis and JFK join forces to bring down Bubba Ho-Tep once and for all and stop the soul sucking and killing.<br /><br />BUBBA HO-TEP has some great acting. Bruce Campbell is perfect for the role of Elvis as is the legendary Ossie Davis as JFK. Like the men they portray, these two actors have had two completely different and varied careers. However, together they form an unbelievably talented acting duo. The story is intriguing.  There isn't a whole lot of violence and the things that are seen are tastefully done.  The movie had a very low budget and many things in the film came about because of called- in favors and so forth. The only thing in the movie that bothered me a little were the constant references to Mr. Presley's gentitals.  I understand why some of the refrences are needed, but at times it was just too much.<br /><br />Though BUBBA HO-TEP is a buddy picture and is classified as horror it is also a semi-battle picture mixed in with a little bit of "grand journey-ness". However, ultimately the film is an Elvis Presley redemption story.  According to the film, Presley made a lot of mistakes in his life (especially the big switch) and has squandered much of his time. The movie allows him to redeem himself and become the man he once was and was always meant to be.<br /><br />The DVD includes several features. There's the usual director commentary (this one has Bruce Campbell along for the ride as well), a commentary by The King himself (which is hilarious), a reading of the original short story the movie is based on by the author of the story, a few deleted scenes, several behind the scenes featurettes, a music video, some photo stills, the original theatrical trailer, and a few other items. Not including the commentaries and the story reading, it only takes about 85 minutes to get through all the other extras. It's pretty good quality stuff and watching it gives one a good idea about how creative the filmmakers were considering the limited budget.</p></body></html>

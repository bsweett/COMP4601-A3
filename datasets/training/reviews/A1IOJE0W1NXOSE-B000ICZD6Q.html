His position is taken over by a young man about half his age, played by Topher Grace.  At first the men clash, but eventually they see that they have something to learn from each other.  This is billed as a comedy, but it has some touching moments of interaction between Quaid and his daughter, and the two men.  This movie is definitely a cut above the usual Hollywood stuff and is well worth viewing.</p></body></html>

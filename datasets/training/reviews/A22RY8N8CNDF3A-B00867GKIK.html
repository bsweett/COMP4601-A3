<meta name="summary" content="Pixar Perfect!"></head><body><p>A wonderful movie for all the family.  The story has something for everyone, comedy, adventure, deep emotional sense, and beautiful Pixar animation.<br /><br />Ed Asner is the perfect voice for the 78 year old balloon Salesman, Carl Fredricksen. Carl is the main character.<br /><br />The first part of the movie is fresh and moving as the the young Carl's life is told through what seems like an album of photos with the final pictures of his wife passing away.  But now we see him as an old curmudgeon thinking he will hold on to the home he and Ellie shared.  Progress is outside his door; buildings are built around him and his home is condemned.<br /><br />At this point, a young boy, Russell, (cute, tubby, Wilderness Explorer) comes into Carl's life.  He knocks at Carl's door and Russell opens many doors for Carl with his optimism and bold ideas.  Russell needs to get a task of helping the elderly done for an award.  The story becomes fun and crazy as Carl, Russell and the house take off with thousands of helium balloons carrying the load.<br /><br />The winds blow the balloon hefted home to South America where many adventures and challenges face the strange pair.  You can't help but laugh at the crazy characters and cheer when Carl at age 78, finally lives his dream.  Russell is a hoot throughout - all I can say it is a fantastic fun ride as well as deeply moving.</p></body></html>

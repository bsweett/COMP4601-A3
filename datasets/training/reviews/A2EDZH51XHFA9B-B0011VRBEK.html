(Watching the DVD's sole deleted scene, an extended version of this opening scene, will both help it make a lot more sense and give you a strong appreciation for the editor's job.) His best friend, Cheol-woon (Dal-su Oh, also in Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) comes to get him, and they stop at a pay phone on the way so Oh Dae-Su can call his wife and daughter (whose birthday it is) to let them know he's on his way home; as his friend wishes Oh Dae-Su's daughter a happy birthday, Oh Dae-Su vanishes. (I'm being a bit more expository here than usual, because it took me about thirty minutes to understand how the opening scenes connected to the rest of the film.) Oh Dae-Su wakes up in a prison-- though it's not by any means a normal prison-- and there's an extended scene about his day-to-day life there, during which he slowly goes insane. Fifteen years after he is first imprisoned, he gets out, vowing revenge on those who imprisoned him-- as soon as he can figure out why they did it. Think Kafka, but with more claw hammers and less existentialism.<br /><br />The best thing about Asian mysteries, aside from the obvious fact (obvious, anyway, to those who watch them) that unlike Hollywood, the Asians assume their audiences have a modicum of intelligence, is that Asian mysteries are usually surprising when the big reveal comes about. I don't know whether this is a function of me being an American watching them; perhaps, if I'd grown up in the culture, I'd watch Oxide Pang, Chanwook Park, and Kyoshi Kurosawa films and be as depressed as I am attempting to watch J. S. Cardone films as an American. I don't think so, though; the simple fact is that Park, who also wrote the screenplay, has come up with a truly twisted mystery, with layer upon layer of surprises just waiting to jump up and punch the viewer in the face. It's not handled in amateur fashion, either; it's one of those situations where you never quite get used to the punches, because each one is just that much harder than the last. And Park varies the delivery methods, as well (the infamous clawhammer scene is so out of place in the early stages of the film that it comes as a shock, but still doesn't feel as if it's actually out of place thanks to Oh Dae-Su's internal monologues. That's good filmmaking right there), so the movie is, while not a continual revelation, a constant guessing-game. It's not only the plot that will keep you watching.<br /><br />I should probably warn you that if you've got a weak stomach for things that normally gross people out, the big reveal in this flick (and Oh Dae-Su's wonderful reaction to it in the film's final scenes) is probably going to give you the weirds. But then I get the feeling that was Park's intention. Me, I was just impressed that Park had done such a great job of setting it up, and I'd completely missed it. This is really fun stuff. ****</p></body></html>

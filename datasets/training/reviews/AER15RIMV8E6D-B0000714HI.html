Austin Powers is a 'sex symbol' of the 1960's and has himself frozen for 30 years, until his enemy Dr. Evil returns. He teams up with Vanessa Kensington, the daughter of his 1960s sidekick Mrs. Kensington. Can Austin defeat Dr. Evil again? I highly recommend AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY!!!<br /><br />Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me- This is an extremely funny sequel with plenty of gags and hilarious toilet humor! This time, Dr. Evil travels back in time when Austin was frozen, and steals his Mojo. Austin also travels back to 1969 to stop Dr. Evil from destroying the world, along the way he meets an incredibly beautiful spy named Felicity Shagwell, stops a miniature clone of Dr. Evil named Mini Me and much more. I highly recommend AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME!!!<br /><br />Austin Powers in Goldmember- This is a very funny sequel that brings closure to the trilogy! It has hilarious gags, and more awesome toilet humor! Austin's father, Nigel has been kidnapped, and Austin needs Dr. Evil's help to find him. He is told that a man named Goldmember has Nigel in the year 1975. When everthing goes smooth in the 70's, Goldmember comes back to our time and teams up with Dr. Evil to destroy the world. I highly recommend AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMBER!!!</p></body></html>

Even though there are some similarities between this and the 6th day and many other science fiction movies of the past it still manages to bring in something new to the genre. The movie begins in a facility where supposedly the last humans are living, of course this is a lie, and they are in fact clones of rich industrialist who want either to live longer or need a new organ to live on. The interesting thing is that the clones don't know they are clones, and the real copies don't know there are clones of them living in a military bunker. without giving any more details this movie is worth buying, the action is very reminiscent to other Michael Bay's movies (Bad Boys II, Transformers) in my opinion this is probably bay's 2nd best movie (the first being transformers) if you liked the 6th day or enjoy high adrenaline action sequences with an interesting and intelligent plot then this movie is for you<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 4 ? OUT OF 5</p></body></html>

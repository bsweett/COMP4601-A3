<meta name="summary" content="NOT NICE TO FOOL MOTHER NATURE"></head><body><p>I have to admit that I was reluctant to watch this film. Inundated with previews for the film prior to its release, talk of how director M. Night Shyamalan was the next best thing since John Carpenter when it came to horror and a personal recommendation that it was bad made me stop. But when it came in I decided to watch it anyway. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The film starts in New York, Central Park where people suddenly stop in their tracks. The silence is chilling and what follows even more so as people begin to harm themselves.<br /><br />Move to Philadelphia and a high school where science teacher Elliott Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is teaching a group of students about the effects of change in nature. Called out of the office, the teachers are told there has been an apparent airborne attack in New York, possibly by terrorists.<br /><br />As people try and rush out of the big city to avoid a second attack, Moore meets up with his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo) and his daughter Jess. Elliott and Alma are in the midst of a relationship crisis that Julian has seen coming, feeling cold towards her since he and Elliott are friends.<br /><br />The airborne pathogen seems to be spreading, hitting more and more major metropolitan areas. As the train taking our travelers reaches a small town outside of the major city, it stops. The reason why? No one is answering their calls up and down the line. This is the last stop.<br /><br />Julian hears that the city his wife was headed for was hit and sets out to find her leaving Jess in the care of Elliott and Alma. What he finds when he reaches his destination is gruesome and startling and its effect on him chilling.<br /><br />Elliott's group carries on and they find a ride. But when they come to a crossroads, cars are coming from all directions, each one with the revelation that further on down the road are people who have been killed. Setting out on foot, it is Elliott who learns the secret of how this is happening, based in part on what one of his fellow travelers said early on.<br /><br />To tell you the cause of this event would be to spoil the surprise. Myself, I knew and it didn't faze me. If you don't want to know, stop reading now.<br /><br />It turns out the cause of the entire even was Mother Nature taking back what is hers, the planet. The airborne pathogen is not man made nor launched as a terrorists attack. It is a compound emitted by the plants that blocks the receptors in the brain that help man from harming himself. Once gone, it also increases their desire for self destruction, thus the mass deaths as a result of suicide.<br /><br />Elliott realizes that the attacks from the plants are focused on only large groups of people. Split into smaller groups, their chances of survival increase. But even then they have to face each other and the fears of who is to blame.<br /><br />Scenes of self destruction and death run rampant and may upset a few viewers. Gore hounds will be disappointed they don't go further. But the fear instilled here of an unseen enemy with no form of defense against it makes for a truly frightening film.<br /><br />Wahlberg is showing that he has the chops to become a great actor. The true gift is when an actor is so immersed in the character that you don't think of him as that celebrity but as that character. Wahlberg is becoming that sort of thespian. The rest of the cast holds up equally well, although Deschanel's character is offered little to do until near the end of the film.<br /><br />This film has taken hits left and right by critics and fans alike. I'll admit that its not the greatest film ever made. But it harkens back to the days of the end of the world films from the 50's that had some unknown creature or fear that caused man to panic and lose track of what was important. It made me think back to those scary films that relied on emotions instead of gore related effects to induce fear.<br /><br />The movie lives in that world, a world where the unknown boogie man, the creature that never raises its head until it attacks, the monster in the closet that is never seen lives. To think that nature itself could decide that it had had enough, that man was the disposable entity in this world that could be removed, is a terrifying thought.<br /><br />Shyamalan may not equal Carpenter in my eyes (I'm a big John Carpenter fan) but he does seem to have a knack for making ones skin crawl. This was a nice change after my disappointment in THE VILLAGE. If you're looking for a truly creepy film for a month when those sorts of films are sought out, this one should foot the bill.</p></body></html>

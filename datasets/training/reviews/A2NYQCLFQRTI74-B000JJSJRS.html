<meta name="summary" content="when will Hollywood learn....."></head><body><p>No plot, no credible facts. King Scorpion and Imhotep didn't even live in the same time frame. When will Hollywood learn?!<p>This is a pathetic sequel to the first film, The Mummy (which was much more fun). It is also a film which make several references to older films in some scenes oh! so clich&eacute; (the jet airship?!?). The scriptwriters obviously did not care about making any sense when writing this junk. Alex's mother would worry but not the father?!?!?! Oh pleeease. The kid seems to have been, at first, a copy of Ramses Peabody (see the Amelia Peabody series written by Elizabeth Peters); however this dissolves after his meeting with the mummy.<p>A film as full of oh! so phony special effects as possible. Some scenes even look like video games. It is so incredibly gory too.<p>The two stars I give for making me laugh from beginning to end, and for its unbelievable stupidity throughout the story.</p></body></html>

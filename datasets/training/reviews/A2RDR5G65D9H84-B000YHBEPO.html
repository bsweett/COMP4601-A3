To tell you the truth though, this is kind of what I was already feeling halfway though this movie. Seeing the number of stars that took part in this production I thought that maybe it was going to be better than the previous attempt. I was sadly mistaken, since the performances of most of these big stars are uninspired, and the only exception is Philip Seymour Hoffman. This actor has the ability to astound me no matter what the role is, even in a movie that counts with the number of flaws this one has.<br /><br />It all starts with Ethan Hunt being questioned and threatened by the evil Owen Davian (Hoffman) and the twist has to do with the fact that Davian is actually threatening to hurt not Ethan, but his wife Jules.  The scene ends with a shot but without showing what happened. We then are taken back in time to see Ethan and Jules getting engaged. Ethan is dedicated to train Special Forces and he has stopped with the field work, but when a former student is taken prisoner he jumps back into the action. And that is one thing you get in this movie, action, a lot of fast-paced chases, fights, explosions and stunts. If this is what you are looking for, you will likely have a good time.<br /><br />For those that are looking for a nice backbone to the story, I am sorry to tell you that this film certainly lacks that. The plot is so shallow that I was surprised and somewhat disappointed.  I can't even believe that after showing a scene in the future with both Hunt and Davian alive the creators are trying to create suspense by them placing these characters in dangerous situations in the past. To make matters even worse, the movie is long! I hope that by now you have a pretty good idea of how much I disliked this movie and what I think the flaws are. If you are just looking for an action flick, I wish you the best of luck and hope you enjoy yourself.</p></body></html>

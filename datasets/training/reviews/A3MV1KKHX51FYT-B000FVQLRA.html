<meta name="summary" content="Memoirs of a Pianist"></head><body><p>The film begins with an old film of a street in 1939 Warsaw. Next a man plays a piano for a radio program. Explosions interrupt his performance. At home his family packs clothes (September 3, 1939). German troops march into town. How to hide their money? Oppressive regulations follow. All Jews must move into a district of Warsaw. Goods are sold cheap. A wall restricts access. Misery follows, the film shows the hardships. A man tests coins by bouncing them on marble (silver rings true). Underground newspapers are distributed to the people. Smugglers throw bags over the wall. Some are caught and killed. People die from hunger. A raid by German troops kills people. Hunger affects people. The lucky get Certificates of Employment. Others are sent east to resettlement camps.<br /><br />People are rounded up into the courtyard and selected for transportation in 1942. They are loaded into cattle cars. Someone pulls Wladek out of the crowd. Workers are marched out of the Ghetto to work. Some are shot in the street. People are sent to Treblinka but never food. Only young people are left in the Ghetto.  Arms are smuggled into the Ghetto to prepare for resistance. Wladek slips out the gate. He finds a refuge with friends. A change of clothes is his disguise, he will be hidden at another flat. On April 19, 1943 the Jewish Resistance began their war against Nazi oppression. They hid in the empty apartments. The survivors were shot after it ended in May. Would the Poles rise next?<br /><br />There is bad news: the Gestapo captured some of his friends and he must leave. There is more suspense. Wladek finds a new refuge. Will he be as quiet as possible? Wladek hears about the invasion of France and the Russian advance (1944). On August 1, 1944 the Warsaw uprising began. The water supply was turned off. Wladek finds another refuge. The film shows the destroyed buildings. Will someone discover hime? Wladek plays for the German officer, who brings him food. "`Spielman' is a good name for a pianist." A sound truck plays a Polish song, the Germans are gone. But there is drama at the end. "I'm cold." At the end Wladyslaw Szpilman plays the piano at a concert. He lived 88 years. The German officer who helped him died in a POW camp in 1952.<br /><br />This story is about life in conquered Warsaw during WW II. It is educational as any true story can be. It skims over the events from 1939 to 1945 to present the highlights. Warsaw was completely destroyed after the 1944 rising, it was all rebuilt after the war. One suburb, Praga, remained undamaged and was used in filming. The ruins came from another country. One lesson is that disarming people is the first step on the path to oppression. They always claim this is done "for your own good" or for "national security". After the Caesars came to power they also disarmed the Romans, and you can find other examples in history.<br />[The book "On Both Sides of the Wall" will tell you more about life in occupied Warsaw.]</p></body></html>

People keep comparing it to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, and I didn't find it quite as good as either of those, but I had read the book, and decided I should see what they did with the movie, since I could get it at a bargain price.<br /><br />The special effects, especially Saphira the dragon, are very good. I liked her best when she was a baby, though. In fact, she reminded me of both the Mogwai and of the baby dragon Rubeus Hagrid hatched out. There's something about baby animals, no matter how fantastical they are. Ed Speleers did a good job as Eragon, but I thought he and his cousin looked a little too much alike: hard to tell them apart when they were fighting.<br /><br />The villains were a little too unbelievably villainous, but I suppose that's the way they are in a fantasy; the heroes extremely heroic, the villains extremely villainous. It just seemed a little too much like a story made for children, or at least adolescents, and I suspect that's the simple truth. Besides, I'm not much on battle scenes.<br /><br />I want to give it four stars, because there was much to like about it, but I have to say that in comparison with others I've given four stars to, this one only merits three. It's good, but it's not great.</p></body></html>

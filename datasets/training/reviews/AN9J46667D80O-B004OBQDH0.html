The Harry Potter series, books and movies both, have been generally very good, very well-received and very profitable.<br /><br />Part one of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is very good. In many ways its better than the first half of the book it's based on. It tells the tale... well, you all know what it's about. Harry and friends go hunting down the various parts of Voldemort's soul in order to destroy him. They do this with the support and hindrance of roughly half of the Royal Shakespearean Company.<br /><br />The movie suffers from one of the same problems that the book suffers from, and that's what I describe as "Harry Potter and the Endless Camping Trip". There are many, many scenes with the kids out camping and trying to decide what to do next. They angst, they are argue, the waffle and debate. This does not make for the most compelling reading nor the most compelling watching. Frankly the camping scenes could've been trimmed down considerably and we wouldn't have lost much.<br /><br />Aside from that, everything about the movie superb, and I'm very happy Warner Bros chose not to release it in 3-D. There's just no need for it. The movie looks fine without it, and hopefully they will abandon plans to release part two in that format.<br /><br />Whomever it was that cast Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint (who looks better and better with each film), Emma Watson and all the other primaries should probably receive a special Oscar for their efforts. They managed to cast the perfect actors for this series, and thanks to that and a great respect for the material we've been treated to a series of films where even the weakest is still pretty damn good. There's not many other film franchises one can say that about.</p></body></html>

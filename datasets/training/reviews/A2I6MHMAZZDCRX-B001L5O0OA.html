<meta name="summary" content="Watch Ralphie Shoot His Eye Out"></head><body><p>It's 1940's Indiana, and all Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder BB Gun.  He knows he needs to drop subtle hints to his parents (Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon).  But when his mother expresses concern that it might not be safe, he has to develop some back up plans.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there is plenty else going on in the family.  Ralphie has to face the neighborhood bully to defend his brother Randy (Ian Petrella).  His father wins a hideous lamp.  And Ralphie finally gets his Little Orphan Annie decoder.  But through it all, Ralphie plots and schemes to get his BB gun.  Will it be under the tree Christmas morning?<br /><br />This movie is based on a collection of short stories, and it shows.  While the multiple stories weave in and out of each other much like real life, they never truly form a cohesive whole.  And ultimately, that's my problem with the film.  It felt uneven to me.  There were several laughs along the way, and the acting was good.  But the movie seemed to be wandering with little focus, and that proved to be too much of a distraction.<br /><br />I'm sure if I had grown up with this film, I'd feel differently about it because this isn't a bad film.  But it isn't one that I will add to my Christmas traditions.</p></body></html>

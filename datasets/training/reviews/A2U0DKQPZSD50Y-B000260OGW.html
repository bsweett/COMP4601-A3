<meta name="summary" content="a great western"></head><body><p>this was the first western I have ever really watched and I loved it. The gunfight was amazing. Costner and Duval are great actors and they made this movie even better. I would recomend this movie to everyone even to people who are not into westerns</p></body></html>

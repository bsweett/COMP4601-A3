<meta name="summary" content="Just an attempt to get more bucks from fans"></head><body><p>If you're like me, you are really - really - getting tired of producers, film compaines, whomever there is to blame re-re-re-releasing the same DVD with different packaging, and calling it the &quot;Ultimate&quot; or &quot;Supreme&quot; or &quot;this time it really is a Limted edition&quot; special releases. The motivation? Raking it in from fans who expect and want more. You'd be better off spending your bucks elsewhere.<p>There is NOTHING to make this DVD stand out from any of the numerous previous releases. Save your money!  Sure the director's cut is great - but it's on what, three previous releases?</p></body></html>

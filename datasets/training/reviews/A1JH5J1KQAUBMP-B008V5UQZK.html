This straightforward film tells the story of their courtship and the clash of cultures that ensues when her horrified parents learn that she does not intend to settle down with a nice Greek boy.  To its credit, Vardalos's screenplay doesn't go in for any contrived "boy-meets-girl-boy-loses-girl" nonsense.  Toula and Ian are clearly in love and I never doubted that they would get married.  The central tension of the film is how-not whether-her family will come to terms with it.  This film boasts a terrific cast of character actors who get a chance to shine in major roles, particularly Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan as Toula's parents./</p></body></html>

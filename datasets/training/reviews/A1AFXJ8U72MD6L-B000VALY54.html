<meta name="summary" content="ABSOLUTELY AWESOME MOVIE"></head><body><p>This is one of those rare and delightful films that gets noir and also has no problem whatsoever stretching the genre and making fun of it.  Kilmer and Downey are unusually well paired in their love/hate relationship.  But the best part is the narrative flow and how it ties into the story yet is still surprising and/or humorous.  This isn't a movie you can watch while doing something else.  It will require your full attention if you wish to spot all the nuances.  Lots of jokes about LA people, especially women in entertainment.  Mostly true.  WHEN WATCHED: August 2010; MY GRADE: A minus.</p></body></html>

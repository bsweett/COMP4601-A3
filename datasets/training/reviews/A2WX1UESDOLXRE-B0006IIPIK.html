Jude Law and Gwyneth Patlrow convinced me to go. I absolutely love this movie. Everything about it. The completely original characters, that slightly blurry way it was filmed that reminds me of old photographs from the 40s of my grandparents, the costumes, the story, it's all unbelievable! And I mean that in a good way!<br /><br />The movie is about Joe Sullivan (Law) aka Sky Captain and the perky Polly Perkins (Paltrow). Scientists have been disappearing, and Polly is a reporter trying to figure it all out. One day, giant flying robots (it sounds hokey, but just go with it!) land in the city, stealing from power plants to get "supplies." Sky Captain is recruited to find out why and who is behind the operation and Polly, his ex-girlfriend, demands clearance because she knows some things about the mystery that he doesn't know. So the movie goes on, in this totally amazing world with characters you are going to love.<br /><br />There's lots to love about this movie. The cool story, the cool effects, Jude Law... okay, Gwyneth too! They make an awesome pairing (yet again--- they were in The Talented Mr. Ripley together) and their snippy banter is wonderful. I was laughing out loud during some moments that I despertely want to give away right now so you can have a laugh-- but I'm going to keep them to myself and hopefully you'll jet to the theater to check this one out. Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie also make appearances, Jolie's name even appears with Paltrow and Law's names before the title in the credits, but it's Ribisi's name that should've been there. He's fantastic, I can't wait to see more of him in Flight of the Phoenix out this November.<br /><br />Think it looks stupid? Hokey? Seen it before? Guess again! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!</p></body></html>

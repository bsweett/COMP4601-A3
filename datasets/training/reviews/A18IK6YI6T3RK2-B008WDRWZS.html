Timothy Treadwell seems to be manic, it's really the only was to explain his actions, that and he at first seems to have a death wish, then it like morphs into a serious mesiah complex, it's hard to watch him deteriorate, you want to look away.  Director Herzog, interjects himself into the film and he becomes a character as well, and I was not sure about it at first, but when he listens to the audio of Treadwells death, you could tell that he was truly shaken and deeply moved by what he heard and his decision not to air it, reinforces this.  The interview with Treadwell's parents was heartbreaking, watching his mom clutch his childhood bear that he had with him up until the end, shakes you to the core.  This is a unique documentary, since the subject is actually a sort of co-documentarian...this is really well done, he must have been shocked that one of his beloved Grizzlies would turn on him, that must have felt like the ultimate betrayal.</p></body></html>

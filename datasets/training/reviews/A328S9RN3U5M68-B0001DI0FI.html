The idiosyncratic world of life aboard a ship (a man-o-war) is in many ways like viewing the universe through the wrong end of a telescope: life with all the relationships, fear, lust, camaraderie, bigotry, animal drives for survival, agony of death from the eyes of the dying and the eyes of those surviving become a microcosm of life beyond the vast stretches of sea to that on the Continents of the civilized world in the year 1805. Patrick O'Brien's epics are well served down to the last detail of grit and grime and ship etiquette as captured by director Peter Weir.<br />The claustrophobia of confinement aboard a ship at sea is staggeringly well depicted. The lighting, the inevitable fog, the allegiance of a crew to its Captain, the British use of young midshipmen, the close relationship between the Captain and his ship's physician (they rise above the rawness of ship life by playing duets on the violin and cello at night in the Captain's quarters), the gore of naval battles both across ships and after boarding an enemy ship - all are extraordinary. The actors are excellent - especially Paul Bethany as the physician and Russell Crowe as the Captain. The music score is utterly breathtaking as it uses Ralph Vaughn-Williams "Fantasia on a theme by Thomas Tallis", Bocherini, Bach and some wonderful sea shanties to realize a very British atmosphere. The music is there when it is necessary, not merely to bolster the magnitude of the sound of noisy battle.<br />So why is the sum of the parts greater than the whole? For this viewer all the splendor and production values somehow bury the importance of who these men truly are. Perhaps that is Weir's (and O'Brian's) choice - that the thrust of the story should be about one ship and its crew and destiny. I wonder. This is a splendid movie and I recommend it highly. Just go for the majesty of it all.</p></body></html>

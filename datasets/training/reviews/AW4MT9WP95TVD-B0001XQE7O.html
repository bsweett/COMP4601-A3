When I watched this, I was ready to be pulled into Tim Burton's dreamy, fairy-tale world and I ... wasn't.  Beautiful to look at, nice score, fine actors - but I really felt the schmaltz come through in a mainstream don't-give-the audience-credit kind of way.  Burton's best makes you feel as sad, happy, schmalzty as the best of them, but without your feeling so commercially manupulated.  There is a depth missing here and sadly, I felt nothing but a pretty surface on this.</p></body></html>

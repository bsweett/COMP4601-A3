<meta name="summary" content="Dark City kicks $^@"></head><body><p>I love this film!!  Alot of people dont get it.  They complain that it has no substance and it leaves them feeling cold. I disagree this film is a send up of my favorite genre of cinema-FILM NOIR!!!!  Proyas uses almost every element from that genre in his Dark City.  WE have the femme fatale, the miss-guided male lead, the cloaked bad guys and the worn out detective who just wants a break.  IF you truly love film noir every in-joke in this film you will catch and the city inside a city idea is brilliant and the Matrix owes it's box office to that fact.  I don't know why this film didn't do better at the box office but it is one of the best films ever made and needs to be seen by everyone who loves films</p></body></html>

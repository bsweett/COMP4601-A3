<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding, even after 24 years."></head><body><p>The box-blurb for this digitally renewed version of Kubrick's 1980 Masterpiece claims that this is the &quot;first epic horror film&quot;, at least according to Newsweek's Jack Kroll.<br /><br /> Now, not to be disrespectful to Mr. Kroll, nor indeed to belittle the movie itself (over which I am about to wax lyrical), but he seems to have forgotten William Friedkin's seminal meisterwork &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, released some seven years previous, and before that, Bela Lugosi's throbbing, heaving, sexual, meaty 1931 performance as Dracula, in the movie of the same name.<br /><br /> But if that was the first epic horror movie, and &quot;Exorcist&quot; the second, then Kubrick's &quot;The Shining&quot; comes a very, VERY close third, and in many ways, beats those other masterpiece works of cinema at their own game.<br /><br /> First of all, &quot;The Shining&quot; is based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, but is not altogether similar to the book, so to satisfy the book-lovers amongst us (myself included, a teriffic read and one of King's unequivocal best) I'll just say this: the film version of &quot;The Shining&quot; is one of those joyfully rare things where the novel loses nothing in the translation. In fact, thanks to the Screenplay's omission of several key-to-the-Novel vignettes (hedge animals, boiler, Jack's alcoholism) the movie production is able to concentrate on an altogether more frightening angle: without any apparent character deficiency or flaw, Jack Torrance is subverted anyway, to the same grisly ends, by the malevolent Hotel. It makes for a compelling comparison - in the book, Jack's troubled psyche is present ever before he sets foot in the Overlook, but here in the movie, the power of the Hotel is such that it can take a normal, angry man and turn him to... ...things. Unencumbered by such character exploration and explanation, (which works exquisitely well in the novel, a counterpoint, if you will, to the madness of Overlook Jack), Kubrick (Rest In Peace, you deserve it!) is able to weave a magnificent and nightmarish story out of the simplest, most mundane of threads, and creates in the movie a Monster which is all the more terrifying because of his apparent normalcy.<br /><br /> Now, to synopsise the plot: Jack and Wendy Torrance, and their psychic son Danny, move to the Overlook Hotel in Colorado for the winter. Jack's the new winter caretaker and, looking forward to having lots of quiet time and isolation to get on with his new Novel, he begins to go slowly insane, while Danny begins to notice more and more the creeping evil contained within the Overlook. To say more is to spoil it, but trust me, it's worth every damn second of screen time.<br /><br /> Performance-wise, we have Jack Nicholson playing Jack Nicholson, but here it works oh-so-perfectly-well. The indefinable sense of rage and malevolence he radiates during the scenes where he is watching Wendy and Danny through the lobby windows, and the yowling Baby Jane-esque mania of the movie's final reel bear all the hallmarks of truly great acting. We believe that this is Jack Torrance, we believe that he is evil, and we believe that he is subjected to all manner of psycho-supernatural abuse by the malevolent hotel. He is, in short, perfectly cast in his role, and gives one of his finest performances in &quot;The Shining&quot;. In her role as Wendy, Shelley Duvall is a light, a wonderful actress portraying with scalpel precision the frailty and ignorant fear of a woman caught in the middle. Her portrayal of Wendy is as accomplished as it is endearing, and of the three main leads in the picture, hers is the most developed character - the contrast between placid, sweet Wendy at the start of the movie and the unhinged, terrified end-Wendy is brought about by Duvall's exquisite ability to showcase a broad range of believable emotion in a relatively short amount of screen time. Danny Lloyd as Danny Torrance is excellent, the much-parlayed 'Redrum' scene is a gem, and he is perfectly believable as the psychic Kid with the weight of the World (or at least, the weight of the Overlook) on his small shoulders.<br /><br /> The Direction is what sets &quot;The Shining&quot; apart, but with a genius like Kubrick at the helm, what can we expect? It's like music; the staccatto, stark interior shots of the monochromatic lobby interior and sterile kitchen make for the most terrifying visual contrast with the dream-like, expansive opening sequence, and the snowy, winter-wonderland exterior scenes provide the absolute sense of isolation that the Torrence family must indeed be feeling.<br /><br /> Musically, I don't believe I have ever seen a film scored more perfectly. Shades of Max Steiner (Mildred Pierce and Now, Voyager) abound as the jangling violins and human-like guttural bellows create an ideal and perfect aural accompaniment to the already ideal visual.<br /><br /> I can't rave enough about this masterful, terrifying and altogether absorbing piece of work. It must be owned and watched, and that is all.<br /><br /> Simple, isn't it :-) ?</p></body></html>

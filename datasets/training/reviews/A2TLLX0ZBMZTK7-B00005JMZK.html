<meta name="summary" content="Eh..."></head><body><p>Eh... I didn't care for this movie at all. I like the first two Alien movies and the first Predator movie, so I hoped that I'd really like this, but alas I did not. The story was confusing, I had to watch it multiple times before I actually got it (or I'm just slow...), I didn't care for hardly any of the characters at all, and I didn't feel a sense of suspense throughout the whole movie. The acting wasn't great, either... I just didn't really like this movie. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></body></html>

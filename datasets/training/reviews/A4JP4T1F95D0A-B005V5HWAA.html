This is by far his best character and acting in years.  William Hurt is great as his alter ego.  I enjoyed Demi's performance and Dane Cook wasn't bad in his first true dramatic turn.  This is a really interesting character study.  Even though you know Costner is the killer, it is full of twists and turns.  Without giving anything away, I wish they would have cut the last 30 seconds and left the ending with him and his daughter.  Either way, it was a good ending and a strong movie overall.  The blu-ray is a crystal clear transfer and the sounds are incredible.  Gunfire seems to be much higher and I jumped when it came blasting out of my back speakers.  This is certainly worth watching and purchasing.</p></body></html>

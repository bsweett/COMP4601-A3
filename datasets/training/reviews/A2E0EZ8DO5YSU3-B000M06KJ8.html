Why make this movie?  The characters are shallow and boring.  Perhaps this is supposed to convince us that the French revolution was justified.  But we were cheated out of seeing the execution.  We just get endless scenes of self-indulgent aristocrats munching on bon bons.  We get the sense that the director is somehow curiously sympathetic to Marie Antoinette, but we can't figure out why.</p></body></html>

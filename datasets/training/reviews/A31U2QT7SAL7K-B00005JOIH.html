<meta name="summary" content="As "balanced" as a film of this type can be!"></head><body><p>Other reviewers have found Spielberg's interpretation of events surrounding the aftermath of the '72 Olympic murders of the Israeli athletes as being "politically correct" and "safe."  Well, I, for one, beg to differ in that the director has taken a controversial story and given us a film that doesn't show either side as being the "hero" or the "villain."<br /><br />Though much of the world condemned the actions of Black September on that dark day in Munich, the "speculation" of the retaliatory actions of Israel could equally have been criticized.  As depicted here, the pursuit of the assassins is relentless with a cast of wonderful actors displaying the various personas of a "hit squad."<br /><br />Eric Bana deserved an Oscar nomination as the assassin with a concious while co-star Daniel Craig is memorable as Bana's partner-in-arms with a penchant for R & B music.  Craig shows a menacing air that might do him well as he takes on the role of "James Bond" in the forthcoming "Casino Royale."<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush gives another outstanding performance as the man that sends Bana and company on their mission.  Ciaran Hinds, Mathier Kassovitz, and Hanns Zischler are equally impressive as the remaining three members of the quintet.  Michael Lonsdale and Mathier Amalric shine as the father-son team that provides information for the Israelis at a very expensive cost.<br /><br />Spielberg's direction has never been tighter and the location filming and cinematography is flawless.  Tense moments abound with realistic situations, especially when the "best laid plans" go awry.<br /><br />Spielberg stalwart John Williams provides an extremely subdued score, never overshadowing the on-screen events.<br /><br />There is no wonder that the film received five Oscar nods.<br /><br />Though it's too bad that it didn't win any of them.</p></body></html>

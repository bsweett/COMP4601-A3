<meta name="summary" content="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"></head><body><p>The Order of the Phoenix is the fifth book/movie in the Harry Potter series.  If you're reading this without starting at the beginning, you need to stop here and go back.  There's really no point in starting in the middle of things.  As for this movie, I think they really did great in the beginning with the series, but starting with the fourth movie, things seem to be slipping a bit.<br /><br />Harry Potter doesn't start off his fifth year very well.  After defending himself against Dementors, he is almost expelled for using magic while underaged.  Even worse, Voldemort is back and noone seems to believe him outside of those closest to him.  In fact, the Ministry is making him look like a fool and actually posting one of their own within Hogwarts school.  And she's a terrible nightmare, who just seems to have it in for Harry.  With Voldemort growing stronger and the kids at Hogwarts not as protected as they should be, it's a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Daniel Radcliffe: Harry Potter<br />Rupert Grint: Ron Weasley<br />Emma Watson: Hermione Granger<br />Helena Bonham Carter: Bellatrix Lestrange<br />Robbie Coltrane: Rubeus hagric<br />Ralph Fiennes: Lord Voldemort<br />Brendan Gleeson: Mad Eye Moody<br />Michael Gambon: Albus Dumbledore<br />Gary Oldman: Sirius Black<br />Evanna Lynch: Luna Lovegood<br />Alan Rickman: Severus Snape<br /><br />I had noticed in the fifth book that Harry seemed much much angrier than ever before.  I think Radcliffe pulled that off in this movie, but due to the limited scenes we never really know why he's as angry as he is.  Sure there's some stuff that happens that would make anyone angry, but it wasn't nearly as well explained as it was in the book.  Watson and Grint still backed him up well, and it just wouldn't be the right movie without the three of them in it.  Gambon as Dumbledore I still have mixed feelings about.  That warmth is still missing from him, although he does have that commanding presence.  I do have to say I absolutely loved Lynch as Luna Lovegood and though she did a fantastic job; spacey yet caring.<br /><br />The plot somewhat follows the book, but once again certain elements are missing that just really make the story.  Sometimes you need a little backstory on things and it was sadly lacking here.  Those scenes that were included were rushed and jumbled and didn't really give a good feel on what the whole story is all about.  A lot of it would have just been easy to make conversation scenes too, but would have held so much information that they would sitll have been important.  Still, the action scenes were well done and they returned a little of the detail in this book, especially within the Ministry of Magic itself.  So I did appreciate that they tried to make the scenes look as authentic as possible.  I just wish they would have spent as much time as that on the story too.<br /><br />The scenes, as said before, were well done.  Lots of detail and the use of magic was visually stunning.  I especially liked the battles scenes and the way they zipped about the screen.  Very neat way of showing that.  The moving pictures are always fantastic, although in the case of Umbridge, the evil teacher, her kitty pictures were almost as loathsome as they sounded in the book, and I even like cats!  They did a good job of recreating that.  The music was still good, but not at the forefront like it is with most of the other movies.  There's still the classic opening song, which I love though, so that's the most important thing.<br /><br />If they start going back to the plot these movies will definitely improve.  I know they can do it, they did it in the first few, so here's hoping they improve!<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012</p></body></html>

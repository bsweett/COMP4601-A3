<meta name="summary" content="Jaws"></head><body><p>From all the hype surrounding this cult classic, I thought this would be the scariest movie ever.  Boy, was I wrong!  Sure, it's entertaining enough, but in a more "shark in the water!" than a genuine scare-your-pants-off way.  Not to say I did NOT enjoy it, but I've seen much more "I'm never gonna go to sleep again" movies.  Jaws is indeed a classic ~ but not a horror classic in my opinion.</p></body></html>

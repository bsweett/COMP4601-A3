<meta name="summary" content="A stellar adaptation of HP and the Deathly Hallows"></head><body><p>Given that the concluding novel in the Harry Potter series covers so much in terms of plot and characterization, it is fitting that the movie was divided into two parts. I was quite wary about this latest installment in the HP franchise after some of the liberties taken with HP and the Half-Blood Prince (though I still loved it). I feel that HP and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is one of the most (if not, the most) faithful adaptation of a HP novel to be brought to the silver screen. There is a perfect synergy of all the elements that made me fall in love with the story of HP as written in the books - great characterization made possible by credible and amazing acting; gorgeous cinematography; a score that perfectly captures the angst, tension, and drama of the unfolding story; and special effects that awe without overwhelming the audience or detract from the story.<br /><br />The only thing I'd like to mention and I feel is important is that this particular installment really does require prior knowledge of the Harry Potter novels. This movie takes it for granted that viewers will be able to fill in the blanks, like why does Hermione have to perform a spell on her parents which erases her existence from their memories? Throughout the movie, little snippets of Potter lore are sprinkled about which will delight any devoted fan but might confound and frustrate any newcomer to the series (which is why I would recommend starting from the first movie and working one's way through the series, in order). To really understand all that is going on, and the significance of certain things unfolding during the movie, I would recommend reading the book (to be able to see a particular scene and think, "That's exactly how I imagined it would happen!" or "Ahh, so that's the significance of the ..." was an enriching and immensely satisfying experience for me).<br /><br />I am not going to rehash the plot in detail - basically, this movie takes off some time after HP and the Half-Blood Prince ended. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) sends the Dursleys off to a safe spot as he prepares to go on his quest for the remaining Horcruxes which hold parts of Voldemort's soul. He is joined by best pals Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). Part One of Deathly Hallows traces the trio's journey and sense of aimlessness (for they know not where the remaining horcruxes are); tension and strife between Ron and Harry; Hermione's sadnesss at losing Ron briefly; the constant pressure of being on the run; and perhaps most significantly, discovering that each of them truly have a purpose, that it is together and not individually that they are able to gain advantage over the Dark Lord. The actors who play the leads have truly come into their own and it is just amazing to see these young actors mature into and inhabit each of their roles with credibility and assurance, playing their characters with great depth. It is even more amazing given that they have been playing these roles for more than a decade, yet never do they show that they are tiring of their roles or just doing it for the money - there's real passion here.<br /><br />My only grouse is that Snape (Alan Rickman) does not get much screen time, but I'm sure that will be redressed in Part Two where he plays a more significant role. Helena Bonham-Carter was a hoot to watch as usual, playing the maniacal role of Bellatrix Lestrange with a fervor unmatched by any screen villainess in recent time (at least in my opinion). Ralph Fiennes portrays the Dark Lord with a credible sense of evil and malignancy, though his appearances in this installment are mainly via flashbacks and Harry's connection with the Dark Lord's thoughts.<br /><br />Three things that caught my interest (well, many things actually, but these three were unique): The dramatization of the tale of the three brothers, i.e. the Peverell brothers was done via animation, and it is gloriously done, with understatement yet is effective in conveying to the viewer the significance of this tale to Harry's quest. Another was the controversial scene between Harry and Hermione (spoiler ahead!) - Hermione and Harry are shown in an intimate embrace during a confrontation with the Dark Lord's soul and Ron who has been beseeched with doubts regarding their relationship flounders whilst the clock is ticking. This scene was tastefully done, and not explicit at all (except for kissing), so the PG-13 rating is safe! Finally, the scenes of persecution against the Mud-Bloods were so well-done and captured the hysteria that was so reminiscent of another time in the past, i.e. Nazi Germany during WW II.<br /><br />Overall, I feel this is a great set-up to the final installment in the HP series, and will especially please ardent fans of the novels. There is a perfect blend of drama, tension, bleakness, and even humor. Recommended!</p></body></html>

At first I was not sure of Phoenix in the role, but when he began to sing he became Cash.  The voice is dead on, as well as the movement and speach patterns.  Reese also does a commendable job in singing all of her own songs as well.  The movie ends 35 years before his death, so it doesn't cover the later part of his life.  That's okay though, since Cash lived enough in his early years to fill 3 lifetimes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good movie, awful theme song"></head><body><p>Die Another Day was an excellent Bond film.  It had all the gadgets, a great story, lots of action, and a new Q (John Cleese) who, although he can never replace the late Desmond Llewelyn, is a very worthy successor to the title because of his wisecracking sense of humor and ability to give as good as he gets from Bond (Pierce Brosnan).  Dame Judi Dench returns as M, Bond's boss, and Samantha Bond is back as the ever efficient Moneypenny, along with Colin Salmon as Robinson.  Halle Berry turns in a wonderful performance as Jinx, Bond's American counterpart, and Toby Stephens is awesome as Gustav Graves, Bond's latest enemy.<p>My biggest complaint about Die Another Day is the theme song performed by Madonna (who also had a small role in the film).  I came in expecting another title song in the grand tradition of Bond themes, complete with horns, guitar, and whatnot, and what do I get?  A piece of dreck that would not be out of place in Saturday Night Fever.  Don't get me wrong; I like Madonna, but a piece of techno-pop like the song she did for Die Another Day has no place whatsoever in a Bond movie.  If they wanted a real Bond theme, the creative people should have gone after someone like Shirley Bassey or kd lang, whose song "Surrender" in Tomorrow Never Dies is the quintessential Bond theme.  Even the group Garbage would have been acceptable, because their title theme for The World Is Not Enough sounded more like a Bond theme than Die Another Day.<p>All in all, Die Another Day is a wonderful addition to the Bond franchise, and definitely a keeper once the DVD comes out.  Just ignore the theme song, and you'll enjoy the ride.</p></body></html>

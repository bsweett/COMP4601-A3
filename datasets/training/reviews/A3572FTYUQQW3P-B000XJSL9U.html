He survives the most implausible and impossible situations and comes back to defend America and kill the bad guys.  He is a GOD!!  There are enough car crashes, car chases, explosions, bombs, bad guys, bullets, and dead bodies to satisfy the demands of at least a half dozen action movies.  I LOVED IT.  This movie shows John Maclane hasn't lost any of his moxie as he thwarts the bad guys who have launched a cyber attack on the US.  However, in a salute to political correctness the producers elected to make the bad guys disgruntled Americans intent on stealing money rather than the more plausible Muslims, who have actually sworn to destroy America.  But then by making the bad guys Americans the producers do get to show the world what a bunch of dumbbells the US government employs.  Still this is a small virturally irrelevant criticism because this movie is great.  It is guaranteed to get your adrenalin flowing and your testosterone to reach new highs.  John MacClane is a real super hero and a combination of John Wayne and Dirty Harry all roled into one.  Willis gets off some good wise cracks and his little nerdy friend also provides some good commentary.  This is a great film and I highly recommend it.  I wouldn't recommend it as a date film, but for guys it is a five star film.</p></body></html>

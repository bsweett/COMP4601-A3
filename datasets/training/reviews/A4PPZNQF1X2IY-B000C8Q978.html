<meta name="summary" content="Broken movie"></head><body><p>I was excited to see this movie as I love Rushmore and was<br /><br />moderately pleased with Lost in T.  Although the movie starts<br /><br />out well with the ever cynical Murray in his dark apartment<br /><br />with choice music and the intrigue of his sleuthing friend,<br /><br />the movie goes nowhere afterwards.  Just the repetition of<br /><br />the 4 plane/car trips, and the quirky old-flames that add<br /><br />almost zero humor and just detract from any focus the story<br /><br />had.  The ending is somewhat sensible (as it shows he's learned<br /><br />nothing), but also lackluster.  In total, although Murray<br /><br />is excellent at playing the cynical, nothing-to-lose character,<br /><br />it is getting a bit dull seeing him trod through stories<br /><br />exclusively in this roll, especially when the script is rather<br /><br />lacking.</p></body></html>

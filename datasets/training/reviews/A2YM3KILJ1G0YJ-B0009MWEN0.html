<meta name="summary" content="Welcome to the Roughnecks!"></head><body><p>This great movie, which I always find funnier when I call it Starship Poopers, is the birth and death of young talent.  It's the moment that we get to see a young Denise Richards, nubile, perky, and smiley.  Oh yes, thank you Denise Richards.  On the other hand, it's the one and only time that Casper Van Dien (who gets a homoerotic, alien, mucus facial during a battle) has been in anything worthwhile; so, it's basically like Bloodsport for Jean Claude Van Damme.<br /><br />There is the wonderful shower scene in which male and female alike get wet and soapy, and no doubt inspired Denise Richards to do her infamous threesome scene in Wild Things.  It's also the scene that the audience gets introduced to the hot redhead, who has never been seen again.<br /><br />Alien carnage and futuristic battle scenes dominate the movie.  What's great is that the alien cockroach looking things rip apart bodies so messily that Steven Seagal gets jealous every time he watches the movie.<br /><br />Besides Richards, who steals every scene, it's a cast of B-listers who every movie-buff knows by face but not name.  It's an entire movie of, "Hey!  It's that guy!" or "Hey, it's that chick from that one movie!"  And that includes Doogie Howser.<br /><br />The greatest part of this movie is the constant voice-over that some sort of news caster works into every transition.  It's a sci-fi, action, news cast!  At every turn there is an infomercial that is so jingoistic that I initially thought it was done to make fun of Nazis.  "Would you like to know more?"  Even the kids get involved in the war effort, killing anything that resembles the bug-like aliens.<br /><br />Ruffnecks!  Rico's Ruffnecks!</p></body></html>

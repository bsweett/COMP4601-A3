<meta name="summary" content="A movie worth watching!"></head><body><p>A very good comedy, Men in Black sheds light on a secret government agency that monitors alien activity.<br />Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Linda Fiorentino (who is HOT!), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.<br />The setting, the plot, the music, the humor, and the dialogues are all wonderful!<br />Overall, it is a movie worth watching, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!</p></body></html>

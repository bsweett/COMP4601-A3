<meta name="summary" content="A flawed and predictable, but watchable 2 and 1/2 star film"></head><body><p>Actually, VERY predictable. Just from the trailers, I knew who the real mole was and a lot of the really big moments are revealed there too. I mean, how much more suspense would have been gained by not showing the shooting-down of Marine One in the trailer? It would have generated a did-they-get-him moment for at least a few minutes, but this is the problem with most recent film marketing. They show too much in the trailers. As far as the film is concerned, Clark Johnson does a good job of directing and the performances are good, but it's a little too flat as far as some of the key players. Of course Douglas and Sutherland are good, but Longoria doesn't really have much to do other than stand around looking hot, and pretty much the same thing with Basinger. Martin Donovan, who is a brilliant indie actor, and has shown such in films like AMATEUR and TRUST, just seems very out of his element here. However, the biggest problem with this film is its villains. It is never REALLY revealed who they are, and it is not revealed AT ALL why they want to assassinate the President. All in all this film is really THE FUGITIVE meets IN THE LINE OF FIRE, which are two much better films. At its best moments, it works, but they're too few and far between for me to truly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

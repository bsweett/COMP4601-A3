<meta name="summary" content="Smart, funny, and yes, SEXY"></head><body><p>Never has an actor and actress have more chemistry and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Their chemistry and an entertaining script give readers more than just eye candy.  I haven't enjoyed a Brad Pitt movie in years-might be as far back as 'Seven'.  Going in to see this film, I wasn't expecting funny.  This movie is indeed that.<br />The movie starts off with two assasins attending marriage couseling.  (That in itself is a hoot) and quickly escalates to bond action freezy when the husband and wife are ordered to off each other.  Any more than that will totally be giving the story away--but this movie is a definite must-see.</p></body></html>

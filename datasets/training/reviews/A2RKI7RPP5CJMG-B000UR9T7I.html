Then, petty criminal Flint Marko (who's got no money but does have a really sick daughter) gets some sandy powers and uses them to his advantage.  Then, Peter gets some galactic goo on his Spidey suit and gets more power (think HGH for superheroes).  It all goes to Peter's head and then he loses the girl, loses the old friend (but gains back an enemy), loses the fame, and takes on a ton of problems which include (but aren't limited to) competing photographer Eddie Brock.  It all sounds sort of like a very long and jumbled country song, doesn't it?  Well, in all honesty, that's sort of what this film is.<br /><br />The film starts with Peter on top and then he is taken down hard, very hard, by co-screenplay writer/director Sam Raimi and screenplay writers Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent.  Sam Raimi does an excellent job with this film considering the massive amount of subplots that this story deals with seemingly all at once.  He develops the new villains of Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace) as best as he can.  He also tries to bring to a close the love triangle of Parker, Mary Jane, and Harry Osborne.  He also throws in a bit of jealousy between Peter and MJ via the introduction of Gwen Stacey.  We also get to catch up with Aunt May and Jonah Jameson.<br /><br />The story is held together rather well so long as it's just Spidey either fighting with Sandman or the new Goblin.  Heck, even Peter Parker's lovelife makes a little bit of sense so long as it's just him, MJ, and Harry.  Things don't get messy until Gwen Stacey and her boyfriend/photographer Eddie Brock enter the fray.  That's where the train leaves the tracks.  It's the same old song and dance as what happened to the "Batman" franchise once the Catwoman and Penguin were coupled together to cause problems for Batman.  The movie becomes rushed, characters are dealt with too quickly in order to make room for other characters, and plotlines are tied up too neatly or just left by the wayside.  That's the major problem of this film.<br /><br />Had Venom/Eddie Brock (played by Topher Grace) been left out of this film, it would have been perfect.  Instead, we get a second-rate, rushed treatment of the Venom character and Eric from "That 70's Show" with an attitude and muscle to back it up.  Every time Brock popped up on the screen (with or without his symbiote companion), all I could think of was Eric getting razzed by Kelso or beat up by Donna.  Grace was miscast for this part.  He's not a bad actor.  It's just that Eddie Brock is played out too closely to Grace's Eric Foreman character from "That 70's Show."  Gwen Stacey is easy on the eyes and does a decent job of stirring things up between Peter and MJ, but the character doesn't belong in this film either.  It would have been much better had she and Eddie Brock been removed from the film completely.  In fact, Sam Raimi admitted that early on he didn't want Venom in this picture.  It was only after a little nudging from producer Avi Arad that he came to like the character's addition to the story.<br /><br />Otherwise, the film is outstanding.  Spiderman's battles with the new Goblin and Sandman are excellent and rival the brutal confrontations that Spidey had with Doctor Octopus in the second "Spiderman" flick.  They beat the heck out of each other.  The special effects are very good and Sandman's action scenes channel "The Mummy" with all the dust flying around.  I even enjoyed Peter Parker's "Saturday Night Fever" foray.  I found it to be quite funny, although it did run just a tad bit too long.<br /><br />The cast, excepting Topher Grace, was wonderful.  Tobey Maguire has a solid hold on the character of Peter Parker and much like Christopher Reeve as Superman, he'll be the only person worthy of being the Webslinger.  Dunst does an excellent job as MJ.  James Franco, despite having to struggle for screentime with Sandman and Venom, does a good job as Harry Osborne/New Goblin.  His character, in my opinion, developed the most in the second film and he carries that development over to this sequel well.  With little character development Church still manages to pull at the heartstrings as Sandman.  His character is given only a basic treatment so that we only understand why he's a criminal and why his fate in the film is what it is.  Bryce Dallas Howard does a good job as the airheaded Gwen Stacey.  The rest of the cast, including Sam Raimi stalwarts Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi, do excellent jobs with their limited rolls.<br /><br />So why four stars?  For the simple fact that this really is an excellent film considering how much information is processed in its 140-minute runtime.  Other than the unnecessary villain cluster that hampers the tale, "Spiderman 3" plays well as an action yarn and even as a moral story of personal responsibility over selfish acts.  If a fourth film is made (and I seriously doubt that Maguire or Raimi will be returning), I hope that Spidey's villain count is lowered to one.  If you enjoyed the other "Spiderman" films, you'll enjoy this one.  It loses its way here and there but is, overall, a very good action film.</p></body></html>

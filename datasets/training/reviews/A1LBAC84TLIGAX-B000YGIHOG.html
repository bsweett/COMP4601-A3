The gore is even nastier than before, and it's even more action-packed than the original. While I may like Resident Evil: Extinction more than this zombie movie(it's so damn good! how can anyone hate a work of genius?), that doesn't mean that I can't stop loving this movie. The story basically picks up after the events of the first movie, except it's different characters in this movie, and as you would expect the infection comes back(though I'm not going to reveal how it comes back). If you loved 28 Days Later, you'll love this gory horror show.</p></body></html>

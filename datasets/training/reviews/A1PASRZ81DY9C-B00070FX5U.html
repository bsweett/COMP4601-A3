But now, I think it's a stupid picture that got overtly violent for no reason. Plus, the chase for Douglas Quaid is what slowed the pace down. Eventually, it becomes a boring tripe with very little going for it. What I liked the film the best are bits of creativity around the characters and the mystery in the identity and whether it's in reality or fantasy. Take them away, Total Recall basically has nothing going for it. Don't get me wrong: the vision of Total Recall is worth watching, and it doesn't look fake to me. Anyway, at least, it is better than The Fifth Element. Sharon Stone actually does well in Total Recall; that is as natural a performance as it could be, considering her long line of rubbish performances. All in all, I wish Paul Verhoeven spent more time in the creativity department but less on violence.</p></body></html>

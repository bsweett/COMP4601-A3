Some scenes are not for the sqeamish, and the blood letting begins very early. If you don't blanch at neck slittings, finger snippings and the sight of someone plunging a knife into someone else's eyeball, then you will get through this. Also, there's a rough scene of Viggo Mortensen in mortal combat while nude. It's funny, sort of. This is really a small movie in the end, and in no way the equal of the far superior "A History of Violence" by the same director. Still, worth watching.</p></body></html>

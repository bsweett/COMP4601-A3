<meta name="summary" content="The best Resident Evil movie by far"></head><body><p>Taking place not long after the events of Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Resident Evil: Extinction finds the T-virus spread all throughout the planet, leaving a handful of nomadic survivors in what has become a barren wasteland.  Among them is Alice (Milla Jovovich), the genetically altered hero and renegade experiment of the Umbrella Corporation, who searches for survivors.  Also among the zombie-ridden wasteland is Claire Redfield (Heroes' Ali Larter), who travels in a survivor-filled caravan with Alice's old mates Carlos (Oded Fehr) and LJ (Mike Epps).  As they attempt to make a trip to Alaska, where the virus has supposedly not reached, Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) prepares a final plan to lure Alice back to continue his research.  More than likely the final live-action film based on the video game series, Resident Evil: Extinction is by far the best of the film series, boasting the most action and bloody violence.  Paul W.S. Anderson once again writes, while this time around Russell Mulcahy (the original Highlander) directs with plenty of visual and enough visceral flair.  Also featuring Ashanti, Spencer Locke, Linden "Johnny Cage" Ashby, and Jason O'Mara as Wesker (!), Resident Evil: Extinction also manages to pay the most homage to Capcom's video game series more than any of the previous films to boot.  That alone should be enough for you to check out Resident Evil: Extinction if you haven't already, as fans of the previous films and the games both should be more than satisfied with what they get here.</p></body></html>

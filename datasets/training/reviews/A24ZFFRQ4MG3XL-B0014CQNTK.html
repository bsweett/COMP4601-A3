<meta name="summary" content="Great movie :-)"></head><body><p>While this was a little quirkier than most movies I watch, I did enjoy this a lot.  It was a great story line and acted really well by ALL the cast.  While Ellen Page was very good here, I thought some of the supporting actors were better still.  Jennifer Garner was great as Vanessa - the wife in the couple wanting to adopt a baby.  I thought she was as charming as ever.  Her husband, played by Jason Bateman was also great as a man with doubts about where he is in life.  Juno's friend (the father of the baby) Paulie Bleeker was one of the best actors here.  He was very supportive of Juno and whatever her decision was going to be.  It was also good that Juno had a very supportive father and step-mother, as is not always the case in movies with teenage pregnancy.<br />I must admit, the soundtrack was totally boring and awful, but the acting on all sides made up for that.  Everyone did a superb job and it truly is a feel good movie that really does make you feel good.  I'm glad I saw it, and while it may not be the kind of movie I'd watch 100 times, I'd certainly see it again over time and love it more each go.</p></body></html>

I'm not a big Brad Pitt fan and I viewed this as just another vehicle for Brad to strike a glamorous pose or two and nothing more. Fortunately I changed my mind and gave it and chance and I'm happy I did.<br /><br />'Troy' released in '04 is an epic of grand proportions, brilliantly directed with a crisp script, stellar cast and memorable soundtrack. Brad Pitt was perfect for the part of Achilles as was Eric Bana as Hector. I would also like to credit Peter O'Toole for delivering one of his best performances in years as Priam, King of Troy, Diane Kruger as the lovely Helen and Sean Bean in the role of King Odysseus.</p></body></html>

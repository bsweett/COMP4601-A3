<meta name="summary" content="Awesome speical effects"></head><body><p>The movie is PG-13 so that pretty much tells you what you wont see. The speical effects are really good but as I said, PG-13 really hurts the movie. I see they have an unrated version but I wont buy it. I did notice that they have an extended version. I thought it was cool until I realize it didnt have more violence, just swearing. Cool effects with a few scenes that are really good but overall, disappointing.</p></body></html>

The book's satirical and playful twisted ness fits right into Burton's M.O (BATMAN, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and SLEEPY HOLLOW are some of my favorite movies) It is quite evident that Burton had a vision is his mind for this film and for the most part he delivers a fun and satisfying film that serves for vast escapism, even though we have seen most of the content previous to in the original. While we've heard the story before and know exactly what happens to each character, it is still fun to get a tour of Wonka's factory through Burton's vision. The set crew has crafted some visually astounding sets from the Bucket's home to the colorful factory. Scenes that we will recall from the original, such as the boat ride, are more fun and exciting to watch. The original was very somber, but here things are pretty fast paced.<br /><br />With the exception of Depp playing Wonka, all the actors/actresses are duplicating the roles of the characters in the original. Each child plays up their signature bad character trait and Freddie Highmore is perfect as Charlie. Helena Bonham Carter is always a delight in Burton's films and does well here as Charlie's mother. It is Depp's performance that is significantly dissimilar from his counterpart. I believe Depp to be one of the most excellent character actors in Hollywood at this time. He adapts well and commits to his characters. Depp opted to go for the same sarcastic oddity we found with Wilder's Wonka, and his performance was excellent. Danny Elfman's fantastic musical score drives the film in a way that makes every musical scene even more magical. Conceivably an even more perfect team than Depp and Burton is Elfman and Burton, bouncing personalities off each other to create a brilliant mix of offbeat charm that never fails to amuse.<br /><br />Thankfully, the lamentful singing is replaced by the eccentric Oompa Loompa musical numbers. Each number is different and completely funny to watch. Lastly, what is also fun about this film is that you can see glimpses of Burton's other films on display here. The opening credits, which consist of a tour through Wonka's odd chocolate bar assembly line, reminded me a lot of the cookie maker machine in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. Also, the Bucket's house looks like it was straightforwardly lifted out of BIG FISH with its odd slant. Just a few things Burton added in to bring together his style. In the end, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY'S plot is reused from the original, but what else did you expect. A few things have been changed to follow more closely to the book. The film is fun, colorful and entertaining. Already pulling in the punters, Willy Wonka is sure to be one of the biggest films of this year.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's not quite "A History of Violence," but it's definitely good"></head><body><p>David Cronenberg's career has been one of the most unusual among prominent directors. After a decade of making highly novel and intellectual horror films Cronenberg flirted with the mainstream in "The Fly" and "Dead Ringers" before retreating into a bizarre third phase marked by adaptations of seemingly unfilmable material in the forms of "Naked Lunch" and "Crash." With "A History of Violence" Cronenberg opened the fourth phase of his career and took one more stab at a conventional narrative. Of course, "A History of Violence" is a far more unusual thriller than it may initially appear, and the same can be said of his follow up "Eastern Promises." Eastern Promises" is ultimately not as striking or as distinct as the aforementioned film, but it provides further evidence that the controlled, idea-oriented Cronenberg can (with assistance from screenwriter Knight) craft a more human drama, and can still place a distinct stamp on a convention-dominated genre.<br /><br />"Eastern Promises" explores Russian-run organized crime in modern day London, opening when a young prostitute Tatiana (Sarah Jeanne Labrosse) dies during childbirth, and her nurse Anna (Naomi Watts), a second generation Anglo-Russian, discovers Tatiana's tragedy-filled diary. Anna takes it upon herself to place the child with the girl's relatives, and her investigations lead her to Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), a seemingly helpful elderly Russian man who is soon revealed to be a powerful mobster with good reason to hide Tatiana's story. Simultaneously we glimpse into the core of the mafia while following the day-to-day lives of Kirill (Vincent Cassel), Semyon's haughty, self-absorbed son who constantly causes trouble and the cool, detached Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), Kirill's friend and an up and coming "driver" within Semyon's organization. Nikolai soon notices Anna's investigations and, after first trying to warn her away, becomes personally involved, even at the risk to his place in the organization.<br /><br />Though that synopsis suggests a crime/thriller film, "Eastern Promises" is substantially more staid than that, playing more as a straight drama set in the mafia's world. Though punctuated by moments of striking violence, the film is more obsessed with character and sorrowful mood, and Cronenberg cuts down on his an ace visuals to create a wintry London locale that is a flat, desolate place, wholly appropriate to the somber nature of the narrative. Moreover, "Eastern Promises" takes a more classically-styled approach to character than most recent mafia pics. While modern cinematic mobsters are typically mundane, bestial or neurotic, the brass of the Russian mafia here display a sort of self-regarding, aristocratic air even as they commit the basest crimes. The film's greatest strength is in the depth of the characters, most of whom initially appear to be standard types, but who grow to be more sophisticated as the film progresses. Particularly notable is Kirill, who is so tiresome and whiny at first, but who finally displays a surprising humanity, especially compared to his cold, business-like compatriots. (Cassel has long specialized in playing self-absorbed French punks, and he makes the transition to self-absorbed, Russian punk effortlessly.)<br /><br />Watts and Mortensen make up the heart of the film. Though Watts's Anna is somewhat thinly written, she is the film's line to the real world, the shocked innocent who finds that a dark, unseen underworld surrounds us all. Conversely, Mortensen's mysterious Nikolai may seem to be nothing more than the mobster with a heart of gold, but his commanding presence dominates the film. Some are dissatisfied with his accent, but I fear that Russian accents are naturally goofy, and Mortensen's pure physical presence, with his dark glasses and slicked hair, generates cool aloofness. He is, however, a deeply sympathetic character who takes great personal risk for no personal benefit. In short, Nikolai displays the mix of detachment and self-control underlined by altruism/honor that marks so many classic heroes.<br /><br />If "Eastern Promises" has a weakness, it is the thinness of the story. Even though Tatiana's story has wide-ranging impact on the mafia, by the film's end it still feels as if we've barely scratched the surface. The later acts are highly compelling, especially Nikolai's deservedly famous, audacious naked brawl in a public bathhouse, but the viewer can't help but feel that there is more to be uncovered. (Of course, this weakness is arguably a testament to the film's effect as well, as few movies seem to demand that they be longer and more elaborate, but the slight let down exists nevertheless.)<br /><br />Still, that minor caveat aside, this is a distinctive, if not utterly unique, film and among Cronenberg's finest. He is known for his transformations, but I hope Cronenberg sticks with this approach for a little bit longer, as quality crime pics are in short supply, and he has the track record to bolster those standards quite a bit.

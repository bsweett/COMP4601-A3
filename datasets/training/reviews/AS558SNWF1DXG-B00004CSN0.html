Elliott Goldenthal's "Force Marker" clicks and bumps and pulses on the soundtrack.  Kilmer's in a grey suit, he's got his shades on, he's grinning, strutting a little, he's roughly eight feet away from being the last man into the getaway car and, oops, he spots a flash of an ambush waiting on the other side of a passing bus.  Boom, in 0.8 seconds he just lets rip with the AK.  And then we're off into a live action "Grand Theft Auto" inspiration, a truly staggering sequence that absolutely must be seen in widescreen.  Turn it up.<br /><br />Finally we have a decent DVD edition of the best cop movie of the 1990s. One of the great pleasures of moviegoing in this century is to see the way Michael Mann points a camera at city nightscapes, clothing, guns, vehicles, wrist watches, cash, blueprints, helicopters, crime scenes, power tools, telephones, cars and the eyes of men and women doing hard work.  All of that is on display here.<br /><br />I could go on forever about the extas here (praising the cool commentary by Mann, slamming the "deleted" scenes, sending out minor gripes about non-juiced-up picture and sound) but others have already done that better than I could.  Great movie.</p></body></html>

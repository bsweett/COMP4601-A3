<meta name="summary" content="I could think of 28 reasons why this movie is bad, but I still love it"></head><body><p>I love 28 Weeks Later, the continuation to 28 Days Later. Even with its MANY faults, I can't help but really like this movie.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later starts off during the beginning of the outbreak. Six survivors are hiding out in a cottage, just trying to get by when all hell breaks lose. Honestly it's one of the most intense and amazing intros to a movie I've seen in awhile. There is one scene I can't get out of my head from 28 Days and that's the tunnel scene. One of the best scenes that I always remember from 28 Weeks is what I call the hill scene. When one of the survivors is high tailing it across a field and you see a mass of infected coming over a hill and flocking right to him. Man I love the intro. 28 weeks after the outbreak begins, and the infected have perished from starvation, the military begins to clean up Britain and try to repopulate it. They bring in people from outside (England was quarantined so everyone else was ok) to start their new lives here. A survivor is found later that's infected, but not like `the infected' were. And so begins our cute tale of horror.<br /><br />As for movie itself, I really do like it, but like I said before there are so many faults with it. And it's mainly to make the movie scary or intense I guess. I'll give you an example. When the outbreak begins again (you know it's coming so I am not ruining anything), the military shoves everyone into one big room and then shuts the power off in the city and then turns on the emergency back up lights. Seriously? Why would you do this? That's the kind of thing this movie does a lot, just to add effect to it. It can get pretty eye-rolling for sure. But at the same time, I still can't help but enjoy the movie due to the fun it brings. Like the helicopter scene for instance. Once you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about. So cool.<br /><br />In the end I would say give it a rent unless you just really like the series like me. I own it and love it but I'm still giving it 3 stars cause of the absurd things that happen.<br /><br />P.S. - Hope that 28 Months Later comes out like planned (supposedly 2011).</p></body></html>

Also, Jake Gylenhaal is perfect for this role and the acting and script are tight.  This is the thriller of thrillers. The suspense, tension, acting, drama and action will leave you gasping for more, yes it's one of those films. Highly recommended. Vera Farmiga, like always, had her good moments in the film too. At 94 minutes this film is really riveting.</p></body></html>

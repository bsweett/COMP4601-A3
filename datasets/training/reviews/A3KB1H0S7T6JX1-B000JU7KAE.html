<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as Shyamalan's other work"></head><body><p>The Lady in the Water was quite a bit of a disappointment considering his other masterpieces (!) such as Signs, The Others, The Village, and Sixth Sense.<br /><br />The movie sheds light on an apartments' superintendent who comes across an unusual girl in the complex's swimming pool.  Soon enough it becomes evident that there is more than meets the eye in regards to... both of them.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the plot is below average, while the dialogues/lines are way beyond "below average," and then there's the great music!<br /><br />In short, The Lady in the Water is really nothing great.  You might want to wait till they show it on TV. 2.5 Stars</p></body></html>

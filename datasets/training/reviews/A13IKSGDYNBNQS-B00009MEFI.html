<meta name="summary" content="Classy little thriller"></head><body><p>Joel Schumacher has directed some real stinkers (Batman & Robin) as well as some minor classics (Falling Down). Phone Booth falls into the latter category and is well worth getting.<br /><br />OK the plot is very sparse, but what there is is well scripted by Larry Cohen. The film is short (81m) and packs a big punch in that time. The best thing about it is "the caller". Unlike all other sinister phone call films I have seen, the callers voice is crystal clear and this adds another dimension (even if it is a bit unreal).<br /><br />The confessional aspect of the film didn't quite work for me, and there were parts of the final 1/3 of the film that I found a bit contrived. However, the final couple of minutes were a brilliant surprise, especially if you haven't worked out who the actor is playing the caller! You might want to rent it first in case its not your sort of film, but I recommend it anyway.</p></body></html>

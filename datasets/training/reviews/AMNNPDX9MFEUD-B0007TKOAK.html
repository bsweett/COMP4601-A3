I have read critics say they were upset about the undeserving happy ending. I'm not sure what movie they were watching but a happy ending is not the conclusion I drew at all. At best, it is a vague and open-ended conclusion. The only thing we might infer is that Miles, as played by Paul Giamatti in what should have been an Oscar winning performance, finally begins to realize that he is a worthwhile person and that he has made peace with his divorce and begun the slow move forward. When he opens the forty year old bottle of wine he had been saving for the "right moment with the right person," and drinks it alone, I knew that his character had stopped the self-loathing that had eaten away at his happiness, his confidence, and his self-esteem. He was the right person and that was a powerful statement.<br />As for his sexually compulsive acquaintance, the mere fact that he managed to get away with his debauched and troubling week of infidelity and cruel behavior does not mean that he got the happy ending. Without any sense of the kind of self-actualization Miles went through, this shallow and most likely self-hating person is doomed to continue his need for self-value via sexual conquests until his marriage is ruined or he has the chance to find out the root of his self-destructive behavior. The grin he flashes Miles as he is getting married is all I need to know that there was no epiphany in his tearful plea to Miles at the motel. His future looks far from happy to me.<br />The women both seemed to be far ahead of their male counterparts. Maya, the perfect compliment to the needy and delicate Miles, has already re-directed her life after her deceit-filled marriage ended and it is her steadfastness and her new-found confidence and independence that allow her to re-connect with Miles and give him the benefit of a second chance. The scene between Miles and Maya in which they describe their love of wine is one of the most eloquent I have seen in a movie in a long while.<br />This is a movie of characters. It is a movie about people who are wounded and far from perfect and yet who battle through the misery that life can be. These characters do things that make you angry and perhaps feel pity for them, but don't we all in the course of our lives? There are indeed no syrupy happy endings to Sideways. There is merely the knock at the door and the uncertainty of what will happen next. If you crave explosions, fast moving plots, blood, gore, puerile humor (all of which I can find quite entertaining!), Sideways is most assuredly not any of those things. It is a quiet movie that takes a wealth of empathy and understanding of the frailties of man to fully appreciate. Calling the characters whiny or saying it is boring means you simply didn't get it. Not everyone will. Not all movies are made for everyone on the planet to enjoy either. I enjoyed Sideways and am glad I bought it.</p></body></html>

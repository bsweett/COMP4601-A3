<meta name="summary" content="EASTWOOD'S BABY"></head><body><p>I read somewhere where Eastwood said that he at first had not considered acting in this movie, but he sort of decided at the last minute to cast himself...if true good move Clint.  The part was tailor made for him as were the parts played by Swank and Freeman.  Eastwood at times makes his movies too long, like in the case of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, but he paces this one perfectly.  The chemistry between he and Swank is touching and real, which is why the ending resonates so strongly.  Late in the film when he finally tells Swank what her nickname he has given her means, Eastwood puts you right next to the actors and you feel like you should look away because this is such a private, intimate moment, honestly if it does not bring a tear to your eye you need to get thee immediately to a cardiologist to see if you have a heart.  Great film very deserving of all the Oscars, though I think Eastwood should have gotten the best actor award as well, this is his best performance to date...hey Clint how about another Dirty Harry.</p></body></html>

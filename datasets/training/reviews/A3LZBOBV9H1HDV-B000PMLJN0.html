The directing by James Wan (who also directed and co-wrote the story to the original "Saw" (2004) & "Saw 3" (2006) & also directed and co-wrote the upcoming "Death Sentence" (2007) is great! The story by Wan and Leigh Whannell (who also wrote the screenplay and co-wrote the story to "Saw" and its sequels and the upcoming "Death Sentence") and the screenplay by Whannell is great! The music by Charlie Clouser (who also did the music to "Saw" and its sequels) is great! The cinematography by John R. Leonetti (who also did the cinematography to Wan's upcoming "Death Sentence") is great. The film editing by Michael N. Knue (who also film edited Wan's upcoming "Death Sentence") is great. The casting by Barbara Fiorentino, Rebecca Mangieri, Wendy Weidman is great. The production design by Julie Berghoff (who also did the production design to the original "Saw" and the upcoming "Death Sentence") is great! The art direction by Anastasia Masaro is great! The set decoration by Christina Kuhnigk is great! The costume design by Denise Cronenberg (who also did the costume design to "Dawn Of The Dead" (2004) & her brother's  (Director David Cronenberg's) "A History Of Violence" (2005) & his upcoming "Eastern Promises" (2007) is great. This is also another hit from the makers of the original "Saw". It is just as scary and clever and inventive.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fairly good movie"></head><body><p>The casting in this film didn't work too well. With the exception of the National Treasure movies, I've never been overly impressed with Nicholas Cage as the leading man in a movie.  He's a strong supporting actor.  Plus Cage seems to be a little old for such an action-driven part with a young love interest. And I hate the hair style and its attempt to make him look younger.  And I just don't like Jessica Biel.  Not sure why.  And Julianne Moore tries to be the tough FBI agent and just comes off as a you know what.  And it didn't help that they left important questions unanswered (particularly the one revolving around Biel's character).  So why did I give it 3 stars?  Well, it does have some very good moments that made it worth watching.<br /><br />The story is actually quite interesting.  A man with the ability to see a few minutes into his own future?  What could a person do with that power?  The film uses it to provide a lot of humor, for one.  Chris uses it in the casino, then uses it to dodge security in said casino.  One bit that was very good was how he not only sees into the future, he can see more than one possible future depending on his own actions.  When he finally meets Jessica Biel, he changes his "approach" several times to see what will get her to like him!  Cage is charming and it comes across here.  While I think he was too old for the part, and the love-interest of Biel, he did well with it because a person would have to have years of experience to use that power as well as he does in this film.  The special effects were well done.  Nothing awesome, just suited to the movie's tone and story.  The story also had some surprises thrown in to keep the audience guessing. When was Chris using the power, and when wasn't he?  The nuclear bomb scare that has Moore hunting him was silly.  I just couldn't see how his two minutes of sight could help there (and neither could he).  The producers never managed to overcome that, though they did try.  It would have been better to just have them after him because of the power itself.  The ending.  Well, the ending will leave you thinking about the entire film.  Some will hate it, and some will love it.  And though I don't like to admit it (as I fall in the first camp) it was nearly perfect for such a movie.<br /><br />Overall, give this flick a chance and rent it.  I was entertained, and that's the most important criteria that needs to be met.</p></body></html>

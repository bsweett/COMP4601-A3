<meta name="summary" content="Jack Nicholson's Most Brilliant Role"></head><body><p>I think this is one of the most significant movies of the 1970s. Very, very funny in parts, but heartbreaking, too. And Jack Nicholson is perfect in the role of McMurphy, who managed to get himself transferred from the jail to the mental hospital because he thought it would be easier. Guess again.<br /><br />The special feature material on this two-disc set helps explain why it was so very accurate. And take it from someone who has been on both sides of the keys in mental hospitals (worked in one as one of my first jobs; patient in several during my wicked hippie days), it is quite authentic. It was filmed in a real state hospital (Oregon, I think), and the actors spent a good bit of time there before they started to shoot. Also, the director was smart enough to let them ad-lib and adjust their lines and the stage direction to what they had observed of real patients in the hospital.<br /><br />Louise Fletcher, who plays Big Nurse, is just exactly the right combination of smarmy sweet and undertone of hard steel to accurately portray the sort of people who rise to positions of responsibility in such an institution. She is 100% control freak. She also knows how to twist everything to make it sound like it's the patients doing it to themselves. You want to call her evil, but you know she probably does believe that this is what is best for the patients.<br /><br />One scene that will live forever is the group session in which McMurphy discovers that all of the other patients on the ward are voluntary commitments who could leave any time they wanted. His shock at this is so heartbreaking, and he plays it perfectly.<br /><br />My favorite character is Chief, the huge native American who goes from a very convincing catatonia to McMurphy's rescuer. But don't expect a rescue scene like McMurphy has been planning. Life is too complicated for that.</p></body></html>

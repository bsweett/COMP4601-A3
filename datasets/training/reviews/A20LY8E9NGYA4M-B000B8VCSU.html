<meta name="summary" content="EMINEM GAVE A SURPRISE TO EVERYBODY WITH 8 MILE."></head><body><p>We knew that Marshall Mathers III (a.k.a. Eminem) was a rap superstar with a lot of creativity for lyrics and rhymes, but when we heard that he was going to make an acting debut, everybody taught that he was a musician, not an actor and he was going to sunk the whole movie. But that wasn't the case.<br /><br /> In &quot;8 Mile&quot;, not only he displays his hip-hop talents, but he also makes clear that he is a complete artist with great acting skills, even if he basically is playing himself, because it's hard to step in front of a camera and give a good performance, specially when most of the people wass waiting your for him to fail.<br /><br /> &quot;8 Mile&quot; is a semi-biographical movie located in the lower-class Detroit, Jimmy &quot;B-Rabbit&quot; and his friends are hip-hop aficionados that have a dream: someday they will be the next big thing in the hip-hop world. But Jimmy's friends know that his buddy &quot;B-Rabbit&quot; is the best rapper around; he just needs to display his talents in some way.<br /><br /> The director Curtis Hanson was able to get good performances from everybody in the cast, the pace of the story is very good also, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is stellar, and the music is just great. The extras in the DVD are entertaining, specially the rap battles that doesn't appear in the movie, because we can see Eminem improvising rimes and songs.<br /><br /> This is the kind of movie that is enjoyable, not only for Eminem or hip-hop fans, but it can be enjoyed by everyone. A very recommendable movie.</p></body></html>

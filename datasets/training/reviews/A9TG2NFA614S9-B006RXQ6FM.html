<meta name="summary" content="A Powerful Doubt"></head><body><p>"Doubt", the movie, opens up the play giving it interesting exterior scenes such as the convent garden and views of the community, but the congregation other than the students isn't really drawn into this cloistered drama. The three participants are keeping this situation among themselves, a church thing.<br />Meryl Streep as the Mother Superior, the school principal, is the avenging angel, courageous, perhaps foolhardy, serving as the accuser, the jury and judge. That's a lot of authority residing in one righteous zealot. Streep perhaps goes over the top playing the heartless, bossy creature similar to the character she played in "The Devil Wears Praada."<br />Streep plays a stereotypical Mother Superior, but does it with great dramatic power. The movie makes her into a dragon as Hoffman calls her, and yet she performs kindly acts for her fellow sisters. The other sisters (not Sister James) come out as a rather cloddish, sheepish, too cowed herd.<br />The priest played brilliantly by Philip Seymour Hoffman is the accused, and a superb Amy Adams is the young nun, Sister James, as messenger, witness and catalyst who begins to regret her role in the whole crisis. Hoffman gives two very effective sermons. The way the movie handles his sermon on gossip with feathers is brilliant.<br />We briefly see the boy's mother, Viola Davis, in a bravura performance. She knows and accepts what she is dealing with, a troubled son. A melodramatic wind and rain storm ends the stormy scene between the mother and Streep.<br />"Doubt" is about ambiguities in faith, in human relationships, in sexual identity, in the dangers of certitude. At the same time while dealing with complexities it has stereotypes and some oversimplistic touches.<br />Hoffman says, "There are people who go after your humanity." People who "kill kindness in the name of virtue." Streep says, "I know people." And "I have my certainty."<br />The early and final confrontation scenes between Hoffman and Streep are powerful and well-acted. Is there any compassion buried beneath the Mother Superior's tough, unbending exterior? Is there a genuine conscience there?<br />John Patrick Shanley wrote the stage play, the screenplay, and directed the movie, a tour de force.</p></body></html>

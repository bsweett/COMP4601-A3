<meta name="summary" content="...and Switzerland created only the cuckoo clock..."></head><body><p>Harry Lime--a wonderful man by almost everyone's estimate--has died in a very ordinary traffic accident in Vienna.  His best friend, Holly Martin [Joseph Cotton], can hardly believe that such a great man has died in such an ordinary way, starts a one-man investigation opposed by the British occupation police, personified in the Major [Trevor Howard].<br /><br />There's a mysterious beautiful woman--Harry's mistress--who grieves pitifully at the loss of her lover.  Holly tries to console her but the woman is riven by grief and spends much of the film in tears.<br /><br />The film is dark and brooding.  The effects of lighting and angle are superb.  Vienna is still larely wrecked by Allied bombing and many of the scenes show a background of rubbled buildings on which workmen are laboring exactly like busy ants.  This depersonalization of human beings plays into the film.  Turns out that Harry wasn't quite the savant his friend, Holly, thought him to be.  Harry was the brains behind an opperation in which limited Penicillin supplies are diluted and sold to doctors, hospitals and clinics with the results that patients, including children with meningitis, are damaged or die.<br /><br />From a ferris wheel, Harry explains his philosophy to Holly.  I'll paraphrase.  'See those dots down there [meaning people].  What difference does it make if they keep on moving or are blotted out?  Remember the Italian Wars?  They went on for hundreds of years and produced Michelangelo, da Vinci and the Renaissance.  The Swiss, at the same time, had 500 years of democracy and produced the---Cuckoo Clock.'<br /><br />The last scene, by the way, is very 'unHollywood' and is one of the great scenes in cinema.</p></body></html>

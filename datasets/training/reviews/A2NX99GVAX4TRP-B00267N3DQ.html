<meta name="summary" content="A DVD Classic that's nothing to Sneeze at."></head><body><p>Snow White was the first American full-length animated feature.  Many consider it Walt Disney's masterpiece.  As it was being made from at least 1934 through 1937 many industry movers and shakers thought Wal t Disney had lost his mind, spending so much time, energy and effort on producing something as utterly ridiculous as a feature length cartoon feature.  Disney was crazy as a fox.  He established the foundation of the Disney formula and established his studio as the one to reckon with when it came to animated features. <p>Keeping things simple and glossing over the most gruesome aspects of the Brothers Grimm classic fairy tale, Walt Disney and company created a squeaky clean protagonist, a hiss-able antagonist and several love-able and humorous characters with names that are still the subject of formal and informal trivia contests around the world.  The film offers several memorable and now classic sequences such as when Snow White flees into the forest or  the Queen transformation scenes.  There are also those memorable songs: "Heigh Ho", "Whistle While You Work" and the operetta styled "Some Day My Prince Will Come".<p>Technically Snow White represented a huge achievement for Walt Disney in several ways.  The detailed character animation complete with very good lip synching, and beautifully drawn background settings including shadows and water reflections were the finest American audiences had ever seen on the screen.<p>Regardless of whether this is your all-time favorite Disney feature or not--the DVD is nothing short of a stunning package that should be considered by anyone and everyone who has any interest in this film whatsoever.<p>The quality of the image and sound is superb.  There's some artifacting present in the very beginning of the film (during it's story-book opening) but then finding any flaws in the presentation becomes quite a challenge.  A few sequences are a bit too dark perhaps.  The best quality prints were obtained, assembled and then given a full spare no expense clean up before being almost flawlessly digitally transferred to disc.  The sound was reproduced and then digitally enhanced and re-mixed.  It is remarkable what has been done with what was one a mono audio track and now takes full advantage of  the capabilities of a multi-speaker home theater system.  Much of the original audio track was recorded in 1935 !  And sure you can hear some crackles and hisses and pops, but the clarity and fullness that has been achieved will knock your socks off.<p>The supplemental material presented on this 2 DVD set is everything you could have ever hoped for.  From a lengthy newly created making of documentary hosted by Angela Landsbury  to some truly stunning archival footage that includes deleted scenes, incomplete and abandoned sequences and more.  Publicity material, footage from the premiere, and even a silly DVD game is included in the package. <p>You also get, now get this, what amounts to audio commentary from Walt Disney himself integrated into the feature length commentary of the film.  <p>Is it really worth buying this DVD?  If you have any interest in the film at all, this is a DVD that you must have in your collection.  Disney is hyping this one pretty heavily and declaring it the finest DVD ever produced.  They are probably absolutely correct.  This DVD package has so much packed it into, you might say that even the bells and whistles have bells and whistles.  Not all the supplemental material is priceless or essential to be sure, but a lot of it is and the additional stuff isn't here at the expense of including something else.  They have opened up the archives, dug deep into the vaults and created a package to satisfy the most insatiable Snow White buff amongst us.  You better believe there's a little to much of the sugar-coated Disney Studios as the KING OF THE ANIMATION WORLD type stuff--but you've been living in a cave for the last 20 years if you didn't expect it.<br /><br />Bottom line: Technically this DVD is a beauty and there are hours of supplemental material to please film, animation, and Disney buffs.  Some of the supplemental material will also drive animation afficianados crazy--but you already knew it would.<p>Christopher Jarmick,is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

FAH! How can a film be boring and irritating at the same time? The plot revolves around some doofus trying to find his wife's killer, but not like Mannix. He stumbles about in a haze due to the fact that he has no long term memory: &quot;Who are you? Where am I? Oh yeah, I wrote down here somewhere..&quot;<p> It gets worse, everything is shown backwards, so we see what happens to the goofball in the end, which is the beginning, but it does'nt matter. By the end of the film, which is the beginning, you really don't care about anyone in this forgettable film. I was asking myself the same questions as the main character. And I wanted a drink.<p>A complete waste of time.</p></body></html>

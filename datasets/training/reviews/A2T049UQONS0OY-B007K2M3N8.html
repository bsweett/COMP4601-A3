<meta name="summary" content="Plays like a TV movie"></head><body><p>My greatest memory of this film -- "Beyond the Sea", actor/director/producer Kevin Spacey's very personal and somewhat idiosyncratic look at the life of 1960s singer-actor Bobby Darin -- is how little the film used the immense talent available<br /><br />In a cast that included Spacey, Kate Bosworth, John Goodman and Bob Hoskins, not a single actor in the group could be said to deliver anything more than an adequate performance. Spacey, who played the adult Darin and did his own singing in the movie, was a shell of the actor that distinguished himself in much better films like "The Shipping News", "American Beauty" and "L.A. Confidential". His singing was pretty good and, who knows, he may have been the epitome of Darin. But he wasn't much compared to what Kevin Spacey has been in the past.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth has starred in a mix of films in her young life ranging from "Sin City" to "Blue Crush" to "Rules of Attraction", does creditable work as Mrs. Darin, Sandra Dee. Her wigs don't do much for the part -- the real Sandra Dee's hair looked more realistic than actresses hair does in the new century -- although she was always well-lighted and, therefore, filmed well. Unfortunately, her role was monodimensional and she delivered the goods as if a cardboard cutout with moveable lips and eyebrows.<br /><br />The greatest disappointment for me was the tawdry and boring character John Goodman was asked to play. Here is an actor of stature that can adapt to many characterizations and adapted well to this one. However, either the role, the script of the direction drained Goodman of his trademark humor and individuality. I wasn't sure if his character was supposed to be English but it seemed so; he spoke with a minor accent and displayed all the reticence of an English gentleman.<br /><br />As to the film itself, Spacey's production was too far fetched in the beginning to pull you into the story. In fact, it wasn't clear to me what was going in the movie's first 10 minutes. Was this a put on, this correspondence between characters in front of the audience? When the story got moving, it was pretty entertaining. Yet, if this movie was all there was to Darin's life, it made a pretty forgettable flick.<br /><br />This movie seemed to me to play out more like a made for TV flick than a Hollywood production. Comparing it to "Walk the Line", the film about singer Johnny Cash made about the same time, was like comparing "Reagan" to "Nixon": One was made for cable with a limited budget & limited perspective and played out like a sequence of frames in the cartoon section. Yhe other was made for the big screen with corresponding acting budget, breadth in production values, and felicities in the script based on solid historical research.<br /><br />"Beyond the Sea" can be an interesting view into the life of a 1960s pop icon if you can get by the cornball beginning and not think about why these great actors aren't being asked to be great actors. But under no circumstances will it ever be more than an average film.</p></body></html>

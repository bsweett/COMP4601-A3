<meta name="summary" content="Cracking ghost story"></head><body><p>I'd be interested to know whether this is an original story written for the film, or a screenplay based on a book. Either way its a high-class ghost story with more tension and suspense in it than I have seen in a film for many years. Stand-out amongst a very good cast is Belen Rueda in the leading role of Laura. Her performance as a former child resident of the orphanage who has now returned to own the property with her husband is superb.<br /><br />The nearest recent film you could compare this to is The Others, however unlike that film I felt much more involved with the characters in this film, and it will certainly keep you interested for its full 105 minutes as well as maintaining a level of intrique throughout its length as well.<br /><br />What this isn't is yet another torture-porn movie with the requisite number teenagers being hacked into small pieces. Neither is it a film with exploding cars and endless gunfights. Don't misunderstand me theres a place for those films, and I've watched many of them, but I'm grateful for something different every so often.<br /><br />This is different and for me gets 4.5 stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jack Nicholson's Masterpeice"></head><body><p>This is by far up to this point in time Jack Nicholson's masterpeice movie wise.  The way the director film it was stunning and will make your mouth drop open from the scenes of the layout of the land when they are driving into the hotel.  Yes this movie as a cult following due to the great actors in it and the great job by the director.  Plus no matter what it will forever have one of the best one liners in motion picture history "Heeeere's Johnny".  The only scene that made me jump was the weapon to the chest of the black actor in the movie that was the cook at the hotel.  But I never get tired of the movie and I will forever keep watching it time and time again when I am in the mood for some good horror.</p></body></html>

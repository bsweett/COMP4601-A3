<meta name="summary" content="Finally, Norton and Sewell are getting good roles again."></head><body><p>The Illusionist (Neil Burger, 2006)<br /><br />I get the feeling that the principal dividing line in the very mixed reviews The Illusionist has garnered falls squarely in the province of whether you saw the end coming. I didn't, ad I liked it a great deal.<br /><br />Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is an illusionist. In flashback, we find out that as a young boy, he had a relationship with a girl well outside his station before the two of them were forcibly separated; fifteen years later, he returns to Vienna as an accomplished magician, and catches the eye of Leopold, the crown prince (Dark City's Rufus Sewell). Who is Leopold's betrothed? The same woman, of course, Sophie (Jessica Biel). Eisenheim and Sophie make advances toward picking up where they left off, but of course there's royalty in the way. Leopold gets his pet policeman, inspector Uhl (Sideways' Paul Giamatti) to investigate Eisenheim. You know this will not end well.<br /><br />The film is complex, and quite pretty to boot. Burger (Interview with the Assassin) has all his ducks in a row here, and knows where to place them for maximum effect. There are some weak points, of course, but surprisingly, Biel isn't one of them; this is easily her best performance since Ulee's Gold a decade ago. There seemed a few places where the script was rushed, as if the director had wanted to spend more time investigating certain plot tangents, and it's usually the case that doing so makes for a stronger movie, but those are pretty easily overlooked. A very good movie, well worth the cost of a rental (even at today's insane prices). *** ?</p></body></html>

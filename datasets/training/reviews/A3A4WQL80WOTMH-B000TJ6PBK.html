<meta name="summary" content="Another hit of bad acid with Stephan King"></head><body><p>It's quick to draw you in, and it does fairly get under your skin in a kind of frustrating way, although it's not a seamless movie and you can feel the hand of the movie makers in it too much. Samuel Jackson wasn't convincing as the hotel manager in spite of his two words of French, and he gets more billing than he deserves as he must occupy about 15 minutes worth of movie time.  Cusack wasn't bad.  The chill factor is akin to the kind of drug paranoia associated with people who went off the deep end with LSD or some other such substance and never 'made it back' (Syd Barret?).  Sixties child S. King's work has often been influenced by the psychedelic potential, which offers interesting possibilities for his novels and more so when left to the imagination rather than the screen.  There are some decent visual moments in the film, but there are just as many others that simply feel like gaudy Hollywood manipulation.  The premise of stepping into this room is that you are stepping into another dimension simutaneously - a dimension which doesn't follow the laws of logic or time, is bent on tormenting those who enter, and from which there is no escape, as it is hardly of this world in the first place.  Charming, eh?<br /><br />The film doesn't really compare with Kubrick's Shining.  Yes, they were both Stephan King, yes they both take place in hotels.  But where The Shining is a masterful work of art on all levels (story, acting, cinematography), 1408 is a kind of fast food by comparison, with a quick story, so-so character acting and more special effects than dynamite film work.  It does leave a mark though as do so many of King's stories, tapping into a kind of primal paranoia.  I give this film 3.5 stars, and maybe it deserved 4, but not 5.  I'm going to watch the alternate ending on the second dvd now, which supposedly does away with the "happy ending" of the theater version on disc one.</p></body></html>

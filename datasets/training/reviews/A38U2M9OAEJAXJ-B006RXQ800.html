<meta name="summary" content="This Movie Gets 4 Stars Because..."></head><body><p>1.) It's an unflinchingly realistic story of an Irish immigrant (Amsterdam, played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who vows to avenge the cold murder of his father by the gang leader of the "natives" (Cutting, played by Daniel Day Lewis).<p>2). At 2 hours and 45 minutes, "Gangs of New York" moves at a brisk pace that keeps the viewer hooked to the screen.<p>3). Daniel Day Lewis is absolutely electrifying as Will Cutting, the ruthless butcher who is Amsterdam's sworn enemy. (Cameron Diaz's role, however, is completely disposable and DiCaprio's performance starts off strong, but flies off the rails by the end of the movie.)<p>4). Director Marty Scorcese is a gifted storyteller, and in this movie, he doesn't gloss over the blatant racism and social unrest that pervaded New York City in the mid 1800's.<p>Is it Scorcese's masterpiece?  No, it isn't.  It also doesn't live up to the hype generated by some critics who gush over this movie.  But it is a solid, raw, and thoroughly entertaining film that's not for the thin-skinned or squeamish.<p>Grade: B+</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Helen Mirren IS the Queen"></head><body><p>This is an absolutely enthralloing movie with superb acting.  The movie depicts very human people in practically impossible circumstances.  Like any other public figures, the Royal Family is subject to incredibly intense scrutiny.  The need to balance their obvious disdain for Princess Diana, with the need to put on a grieving face for the Nation and world was clearly very difficult.  The Oscar that Mirren won was very well-deserved.  She is simply phenomenal in this movie.  I had to remind myself on numerous occasions that I was watching a movie and not peeking into the private lives of the actual parties involved.<br /><br />Tony Blair was also depicted in a heroic sense in that he allowed the Queen to succeed in a very difficult time while he played puppet master in the background.  Excellent acting, excellent story, and an overall excellent movie.  This is a movie not to be missed.  5 solid stars!</p></body></html>

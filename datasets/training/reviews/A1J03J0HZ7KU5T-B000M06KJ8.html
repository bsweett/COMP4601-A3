"Marie Antoinette" has everything money can buy - except focus and pacing. Coppola doesn't know whether she's making a detailed historical drama or a postmodern satire for the MTV generation. The 123-minute running time should have been slashed in half. Kirsten Dunst does her best under trying circumstances, while a miscast Jason Schwartzman does his worst. Beautiful cinematography and an eclectic soundtrack are utterly wasted. I want my two hours back or the producers can send me a free round-trip ticket to Versailles.</p></body></html>

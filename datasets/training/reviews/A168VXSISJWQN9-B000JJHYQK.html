<meta name="summary" content="A potboiler"></head><body><p>This is a run-of-the-mill political thriller, and only the presence of Michael Douglas, Kiefer Sutherland and Kim Basinger gets it as high as mediocrity. Michael Douglas plays Garrison, a secret agent whose inability to keep his pants on has cost him his best friend (secret agent Breckinridge, played by Sutherland) and compromised his position as head of security for the first lady (and he's the hero!). Some guys with various foreign accents want to murder the president and suspicion of being the mole in the secret service supplying them with information falls on Garrison. By an amazing coincidence, the agent chosen to bring in Garrison is Breckinridge. From then on the movie follows a pattern we've all seen many times before- Garrison fleeing, the secret service after him, the bad guys setting up a plot with the real mole, Garrison searching for evidence to clear himself and prevent the conspirators from succeeding in their vile machinations and the climactic gunfight at the OK Corral, or in this case Toronto City Hall.<br /><br />It's not a terrible movie, the action is exciting and the cinematography is good- some great views of Toronto, which was my home town for 25 years. The acting is excellent, as you'd expect from this cast. There just isn't any unexpected twist to lift it out of the ordinary. A DVD to watch when it's a slow night on TV, which is exactly when I watched it.</p></body></html>

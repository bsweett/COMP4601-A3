<meta name="summary" content="brilliantly constructed story"></head><body><p>It's so hard these days to come up with something new in the whole assassin genre but director Paul McGuigan has as well as screenwriter Jason Smilovic. We all know McGuigan has style from his Gangster No. 1 movie but Lucky Number Slevin takes it to the next level.<br /><br />Josh Hartnett whose acting choices can range from brilliant (Black Hawk Down) to head-scratchingly odd (Hollywood Homicide) is back to being brilliant. For much of the early part of the movie he acts wearing only a towel (the ladies all thank you, Mr. McGuigan) but it's no simple gimmick. It gives his character that literal fish out of water (yes, bad puns r us) sense.<br /><br />Throw in the absolutely delicious Lucy Liu in a role that finally showcases her ability to Kate Hepburn the snappy dialogue up while also being incredibly naturally sexy. She hits all the right notes on this one.<br /><br />Then I haven't even mentioned the heavyweights from Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Bruce Willis to Stanley Tucci. It's a superb cast and they all are note perfect in their roles.<br /><br />The story itself is a witty, intelligent yet with completely wacky premise that evokes an almost John Le Carre type spy storyline. Not that spies are the protagonists but there is a lot of "watching" what the other guy is doing and chess moves (there are a couple of actual chess scenes) as Hartnett pulls the strings to gain the revenge he so wants.<br /><br />Amazing bit of filmmaking.<br /><br />Extras are just commentary tracks and deleted scenes.</p></body></html>

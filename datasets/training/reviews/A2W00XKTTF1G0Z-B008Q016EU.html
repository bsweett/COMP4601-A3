I enjoyed every frame of it and I applaud Drew Barrymore for getting the ball rolling. If you didn't know Drew Barrymore was the Executive Producer of this film and she is also helming the sequel with all three returning! Yahooo!<p>This face paced, special effects ridden, technically advanced design, free-spirited rock'n'roll adventure is filled with humor and energy that left me bouncing my seat. Directed by MTV music video director McG (short for Joseph McGinty Nichol) the film is magic potpourri of fun and adventure. McG is also in pre-production of Charlie's Angeles's 2 as this review goes into writing.<p>How could you go wrong with a cast like Drew, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu teamed up with Bill Murray as Bosley and the original voice of Charlie from the TV show - John Forsythe. You have the perfect villain (you think) like Tim Curry and other nasties really well played by Sam Rockwell, Kelly Lynch and Crispin Glover (George McFly from the Back To The Future movies.) It's got everything and is a lot of fun!<p>The story is simple - in amiss-directed ply Charlie's Angles are guided to a wrong goal for the wrong purpose only to find themselves trapped and control and almost...well let's just say the way they get out of everything is fun, fantastic and very much sur-real Matrix like.<p>The DVD extras are very cool. Music videos, deleted scenes, bloopers, extended scenes and the commentary is hysterical to listen to. There are stills and lots of behind the scenes interviews that give you another inside into film making from props, costumes, stunts and special effects. Drew and the girls must have had a great time making this one because I had fun watching it. Hats off to you Drew! Get this DVD! (8-25-02)</p></body></html>

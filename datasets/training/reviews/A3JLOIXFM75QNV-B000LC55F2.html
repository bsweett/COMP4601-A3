<meta name="summary" content="A great, but confusing magic show"></head><body><p>Because they came out in the same year, mant people were comparing this to The Illusionist and claming it was far more superior. I disagree. The Prestige may have more 'meat' on it, but The Ilusionist was far more enjoyable and had a better flow. However, The Prestige is also a far darker film. And the actors attached this this were all a great sight to behold. Hugh Jackman is a man obsessed. He is looking for the perfect trick and is insanely jealous that his former friend and partner has accomplished one. He becomes obsessed in discovering Christian Bale's secret. And the discovery, though intriguing, isn't really that surprising. However, it gets a whole lot confusing after Jackman's character discovers what he thinks is the perfect way to accomplish the ultimate trick of tricks. In fact, its borderline Sci-fi. There are no spoilers here, but I would certainly say that this movie needs to be watched more than once to be fully understood. But it is definitely worth it.</p></body></html>

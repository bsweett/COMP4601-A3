<meta name="summary" content="Go Crash this Hilarious Wedding Triumph of Laughs"></head><body><p>Dearly Beloved gather together at your local theater and see Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson be "Wedding Crashers" two young men who crash weddings under false names for Babes, Booze and alot more Babes and Booze, but then one has fallen for a senator's daughter and the other has fallen apart by the affection of a horny little red head babe. The two find their future mates in the laugh out loud riot. There hasn't been a hilarious buddie movie like this since "Some Like it Hot" One of the funniest movies I've ever seen and the funniest of the year. Vince Vaughn is on hilarious fire, his finest hour and Owen Wilson is very funny too. One of these two geniuses may the comedy star of this decade as was Chaplin in the 20s and the Marx Bros. in the 30s. When you hear this title what sounds better than "Wedding Crashers" If you love slapstick comedy, this is great one. Like your Wedding night this is a gust busting party of laughs you'll never forget and enjoy again and again. "never leave a fellow crasher behind" "I love you jermey, I love you oooh!"</p></body></html>

The only problem I had was the portrayal of Max Baer. If you don't know anything about him this won't bother you. Max was not the ogre and villian as portrayed in the movie. It was said by his son that when he accidentally killed a man in the ring that he cried his eyes out and had nightmares about it for the rest of his life. Also Max was the clown prince of boxing and an easy going partier who loved to have a good time and was good natured. The thing that bothered me about him being portrayed as such a heel and evil villian is that people who don't know the truth will take this as the truth. But I must say they way they portray Max as the heel and Braddock as the good guy does make for good cinema.<br /><br />That said Russell Crowe and Craig Bierko shine as the two great fighters. The story is a natural underdog story. It will also show people what it was like in the great depression and how people literally had nothing.<br /><br />I thought the fight scenes were passable and being a boxer and fan I am not impressed by most of hollywoods boxing sequences (Homeboy with Mickey Rourke being one of the most realistic I have seen filmed and Rocky being one of the worst ever). Renee Zellweger is good in her role and Paul Giamani is excellent as his Crowes trainer.<br /><br />Good movie check it out. Its well worth purchasing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One brilliant musician."></head><body><p>This 2004 movie is about the life and career of Ray Charles, the blind musician.  Ray was not born blind, but became blind at 6 after having glaucoma.  We are shown that Ray got his strength from his mother who never babied him and made him do things on his own.  Ray's struggle through life was hard--fighting off people who ripped him off, and a long time heroin addiction.  Ray was also, himself a ruthless businessman at times.  Ray Charles marries his "B" and they were together for many years, despite his many affairs.  I am not a big fan of his music, but this film held me.  It truly is a great movie!  It shows that no matter how handicapped one is, you can do what you dream of as long as you believe in yourselve.The performance of Jamie Fox is excellent!  He truly showed how good an actor he can be.  They movie was a little long (a little over 3 hours), hence the 4 stars, not 5--- I was getting a little impatient.  Overall a must see film!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="There is no war that can be redeemed"></head><body><p>This film is a beautiful show though it will not in anyway change the face of the world. It shows that war is a horrible adventure in which motivations are absolutely perverse, perverted and hypocritical. One goes to war for a woman who was stolen from him. Women are nothing but homestead possessions. One goes to war to increase his power by conquering people who resist him. War is a power game that is won or lost after many deaths of soldiers and civilians who are not supposed to question any point but only to obey. War is blind obedience for the soldiers and blind submission for the civilians. One goes to war for the pleasure of fighting to show his prowess, his courage, his ? invincibility ? and yet he will be killed in the heart of victory because no one is invincible, no war is a clean parade on an empty boulevard. Then supplementary motivations appear during the fighting or the discussions and rivalries among chiefs. It is such events, like the killing of a cousin, the manhandling of a prisoner, or any dramatic event, that can change the course of a war and bring into the battle people who wanted to remain neutral. War is a big pot in which spiders and predators are cooking, some enemies, some allies. Finally most soldiers are going into the war with only one objective : looting and taking advantage of the situation to satisfy their basic and repulsive instincts to hurt, torture, maim and enjoy the barbarity of such acts. Finally a war is always lost in the long run and the victors are vanquished as Handel would say in Alexander's Feast. A few of the princes of Troy will escape and they will create Rome who will eventually conquer Greece and submit them to their power. History is always a vengeful game if the will, interests and peace of the people are not taken into account. Finally a war can only be won through a genocide : kill all your enemies and you will carry the day. This film is the exposure of war as a crime against humanity. Yet there are in this film a few, very few, but a few nevertheless, scenes that redeem such horror. The ? invincible ? Achilles is vanquished by a sudden and unexplainable love that leads him into a mistake and a trap, and there is no escape, no pardon, no tolerance, no considering the honorable actions of before. He is an enemy, so he has to be killed. Everyone will like the Trojan horse immensely that shows a war is always won through perfidy, ruse, deception and the exploitation of the gullibility of the opponents. Nothong has changed except that we are more conscious and sensitive to crime and perverse actions, and that we have media who will expose any tresspassing from some guideline. War is based on lies but the media have the responsibility to expose such lies and when they are exposed the war is lost for the liars who are exposed as such at the same time. Yet the film is short on the real stakes of this war : the control of eastern commercial routes and the danger such a strategic position represents for those who are thus controlled by this commercial power.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WOW,REAL GOOD EDGE OF UR SEAT THRILLER!!!"></head><body><p>Whew! That's entertainment! "Taken" has to be the most intense, exciting Liam Neeson movie to date! Like Tchaikovsky's music for Swan Lake, this film begins very quietly and continues to smoothly, evenly ramp up a cresendo to absolute ferosity. The energy and suspense of the ending might even leave you breathless. Opening on a child's birthday party, this film opens slowly, delibertly building back story. You get to know Bryan (Neeson), his history as a spy, how he has been affected by the disolusion of his marriage and his estrangement from his daughter. You meet some of the people with whom he used to work and the frienships he's maintained. When his daughter wants to go to a trip to Paris with a friend you understand his reaction - and why he gives in. Everything is nailed down in the first act. No loose ends are left for later. The avantage of this unusual but obviously deliberate approach is that, as the cresendo continues and the action begins, there is nothing in the way. It's a straight line from what's this about to Whoa! I can breathe again. This would be a great action thriller by any measure. But, with Neesom at the top of his craft, he pushes this film into a realm of something else. I hope my thoughts are helpful! B+</p></body></html>

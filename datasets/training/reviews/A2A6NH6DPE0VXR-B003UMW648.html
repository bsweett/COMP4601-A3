However, it's less magical with less character build-up and the villians are forgettable especially compared to the White Witch. Plus some scenes you won't understand unless you read the book. Like  for instance I had no idea why the water takes the form of a bearded figure. Perhaps the book explains that but the movie doesn't. While there's also a scene where two evil creatures appear out of nowhere to try and bring the White Witch back. So yeah the direction isn't involving enough on what's going on sometimes. It's like he had too much fate in that all the viewers read the book. While action is well done but there's more action than story as well.<br /><br />  The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes yet it barely takes time to tell an actual story. I mean we're supposed to care about Caspian's friendship with his dwarf tudor who taught him about Narnia. But we never see Caspian as a kid being taught by him like in the book "I only read the beginning so far". The movie starts off with the dwarf sending an older Caspian away to safety. While by looking at the guy you wouldn't even be able to tell that he's supposed to be a dwarf. They could've at least done some CGI magic to make him look shorter but instead we get a dwarf that looks more like Santa Clause. Maybe he's not even supposed to be a dwarf in the movie but in the book he was.<br /><br />  Despite having pleanty to complain about I still enjoyed this movie. The kid actors have improved acting wise and were up to the task. Georgie Henley who plays Lucy is still the best of them though. She's probably the most magical thing about any of the movies. While Peter Dinklage (Elf, Nip/Tuck season 4) as a dwarf is one of the only new characters I really cared about. A talking mouse with a sword does get some laughs though. Even if he is a mouse version of Puss N'Boots pretty much. Hopefully though they have more character build-up, better direction and more sense of wonder and magic in the 3rd movie. So far the movies are just good when they could be excellent with the right director and writers involved.</p></body></html>

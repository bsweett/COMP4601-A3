<meta name="summary" content="Michael Clayton"></head><body><p>`Michael Clayton' is a masterly portrayal of corporate greed and manipulations brought to justice by one man. George Clooney play Michael Clayton who is a big time law firm fixer who goes to the aid of one of the firms lawyers who has a breakdown whilst working on a corporate litigation case. This film follows what lead to the breakdown and what happens to all involved and leads to a conclusion that will leave a smile on your face as you see the corporate machinations get their comeuppance. This is probably the best role I've seen Clooney in and he really drives this film the whole way, but saying that the supporting cast is outstanding with amazing performances from Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson. This is a slow starting film but it has a tense conclusion and makes for a great political thriller and one well worth checking out.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

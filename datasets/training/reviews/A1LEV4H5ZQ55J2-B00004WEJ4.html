<meta name="summary" content="A REAL COLLECTOR'S SET"></head><body><p>Perfect audio and video as clear as a crisp on this two disc set.<br /><br />Casablanca is that 1943 wartime favorite love story, with a most unforgettable cast.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart plays the proprietor of Rick's American Club, a nightclub centered in the intrigue and action of German occupied French Morocco. The French have just capitulated to the Germans and established the Vichy government, a puppet pro-German government, but not all French authorities in Casablanca are in agreement. Claude Rains plays the chief of police and shrewdly entertains the German occupiers, as he continues taking care of number one.<br /><br />Paul Henreid plays a French resistance leader running for his life and hopeful of obtaining exit visas in Casablanca for he and his wife (Ingrid Bergman). But they are not the only ones. Many of the emigres are in desperate need of more money to buy a seat to Lisbon and from there America. The turnover of desperate souls all meet, dine, and gamble at Rick's where they convey the challenge of not knowing how to get out.<br /><br />Casablanca is a love story about nationalism and of people. Rick is introduced as a hard boiled businessman without patriotism or caring. His fellow nightclub owner (of the Blue Parrot) is played by Sydney Greenstreet, also an unscrupulous dealer. And to make the trio complete Peter Lorre plays a daredevil murderer who recently killed two German soldiers to get hold of the diplomatic pouch that contained two blank exit visas.<br /><br />The second disc contains the usual features one might expect; "a tribute to Casablanca", "Bacall on Bogart" - a candid discussion from Lauren Bacall on the life and career of her husband, Humphrey Bogart, and newly discovered deleted scenes and outtakes.<br /><br />All in all, this set is the way to go. The quality of the black and white footage is sharp, the sound unbroken. I already had a DVD of Casablanca but was not satisfied with the video. After viewing this set I threw the other away.<br /><br />Have a look see.</p></body></html>

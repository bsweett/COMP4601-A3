This story has so many layers to it<br />and is well told and acted. You will either love it or you'll<br />hate it, depending on what you like to get out of the movies<br />that you watch. I don't want to bore you with a scene-by-scene<br />depictment in my review, because they're are so many reviewers<br />who have already done that for you!--But my heading for this<br />review says it all basically!--Two people in a very repressed<br />and socially narrow time who meet, get married, and do<br />what people of their time where expected to do...<br />only they completely lose themselves, their dreams,<br />and what chance at true happiness that they have<br />due to the need to fit in.<br />There's alot of angst and inner turmoil within these characters. Everything is done subtlely...but deeply felt.<br />The 1950's were on many levels about conformity and not bucking<br />the status quo...at least for the adults of that time!<br />The kids were on another page!<br />(i.e. Rock-n-Roll, James Dean, Elvis, etc.)<br />It ends on a very sad and unexpected note that left me kind<br />of up in the air, but I have to give it 4 stars on the strength<br />of the acting and subject matter. It's not for everyone,<br />but it's still a quality film.<br />The actor who played (John) the mental patient who comes<br />over and completely sees through all their BS gave<br />a great & hilarious performance as well!<br />I loved what he brought to it!<br />Like an idiot savant/soothsayer who you'd like to<br />strangle because he won't shut the hell up!

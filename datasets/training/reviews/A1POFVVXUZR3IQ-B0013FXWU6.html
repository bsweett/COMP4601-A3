It is not often that I get mesmerised by a single actor's performance, but Daniel Day Lewis' performance in There Will Be Blood truly had me riveted from start to finish, not an easy feat given the movie's 2.5 hours length. It was an amazing performance filled with depth and emotion.<br /><br />There Will Be Blood traces the rise of Daniel Plainview, a miner who soon discovers more lucrative prospects in oil. He also finds himself adopting an orphaned infant boy whom he raises as his own. The boy, H.W. [played as a kid by Dillon Freasier] is 'used' to promote Plainview's own interests by picturing him as a wholesome, family-oriented man, despite the lack of a wife by his side. Plainview zealously goes about securing mineral lease rights and his fortunes take a turn for the better when a young man named Paul Sunday [Paul Dano] shows up in his office one day claiming to know the whereabouts of an oil-rich territory in exchange for a sum of money.<br /><br />So Daniel and his son go to Little Boston, CA and not only do they strike gold in the discovery of oil but it sets the stage for an enduring conflict between Plainview and Eli Sunday [Paul Dano again], an evangelist who tries to rival Plainview for the leadership of the community, but of course Plainview is having none of that - he doesn't like sharing anything.<br /><br />Paul Dano's performance as the overly-religious Eli Sunday is filled with a simmering fervour that releases itself into loud exhortations to God and yes, Plainview and I would say that these two actors, Day Lewis and Dano are the real reasons to watch this movie. Their conflict and animosity towards each other is apparent from the first time they meet and it only gets worse as time progresses.<br /><br />The story of There Will Be Blood is multi-faceted and complex and we see how Daniel's character evolves from a simple, hardworking miner and loving dad into a ruthless businessman who acts out in violence when he is crossed and spirals into self-destruction, losing him truly precious things along the way, such as friendship and most importantly his close bond with his adopted son.<br /><br />Powerful performances, a well-plotted storyline and masterful direction by Paul Thomas Anderson - a must-watch!</p></body></html>

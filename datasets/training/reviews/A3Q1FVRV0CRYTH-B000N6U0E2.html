I've always been a fan of Will Smith, and this film really shows he's more than just a funny guy, he really can express real emotion, and it's the subtlety with which he expresses it that really shows his acting chops.  In a role that could have easily been `over-acted', Will Smith gives us raw human feeling and emotion that we can all relate to and understand.<br /><br />As Chris Gardener, a man who made a few bad decisions and is now paying the price, Will Smith shows us many layers of this man.  He's angry with his wife Linda (Thandie Newton) for her lack of faith in him...he's disappointed in himself for not having been more than he is...and most of all he's scared of disappointing his son Christopher (Jaden Smith).  After venturing into the business of selling a bone density x-ray machine, a machine that is all but impossible to sell, Chris ends up broke and unable to keep his family together.  His wife Linda leaves him and soon he's thrown out of his apartment and left on the street.<br /><br />In an attempt to make a better life for his son Chris enrolls in an internship with a local Stock Brokerage Firm and really pushes himself to be the best he can in order to get the job and provide for his family.  Yes, there are times when this film feels very slow, long and even generic.  They repeat a lot of scenes in order to really show the horrible state he and his son were in, the obstacles he had to overcome all in hopes to make his triumph in the end all the more heartwarming, but it's really Will Smith's performance that makes the film what it is...that and his chemistry with real life son Jaden who definitely takes after his father and serves up one of the most endearing and real characters brought to the cinema this year.<br /><br />Yes, `The Pursuit of Happyness' may be the `Cinderella Man' of 2006 (personally `Cinderella Man' was the better film), but with powerful performances but the two Smiths it's brought to a different level and made worthy of the viewers time, attention and money...and Will Smith I'm sure with rightfully receive his second Oscar nomination!</p></body></html>

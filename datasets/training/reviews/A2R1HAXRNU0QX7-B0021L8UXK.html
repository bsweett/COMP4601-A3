<meta name="summary" content="3.5 stars.  Good, honest thrills from this modest but effective film."></head><body><p>THE CRAZIES is not a great film, nor will it likely even enter the "Hall Of Fame" of zombie-type movies.  However, it is a tight, well-constructed and reasonably well-acted thriller that is more than worthy of a look.<br /><br />In the small mid-western town of Ogden's Marsh, high school baseball season is just getting started.  Everyone in town is there to size up the quality of this year's team...and frankly, life just couldn't get any finer.  In less than 2 minutes, we get learn all we need to know about this little town...we see that it's a town where everyone knows everyone.  Everyone has a place and is contented.  Life is simple but satisfying.  But when a glassy-eyed farmer with a shotgun wanders onto the field of play (actually, he has what might be described as a zombie-like stare), the sheriff (played at a perfect pitch by Timothy Olyphant) tried to talk him out of his weapon.  Their brief, tense confrontation ends in the death of the farmer...and the town is rattled.  Things quickly escalate as more and more citizens begin acting weird, violent and yes, CRAZY.<br /><br />It isn't quite a zombie movie...no dead person is coming back to life.  In fact, it's more a cousin to 28 DAYS LATER, where the zombies were really just people infected with rage.  But whatever the case, we essentially see the very quick collapse of this little society...especially when the government quarantines them and begins to separate the sick from the well.<br /><br />The movie takes a fairly predictable path from here...there's not really much we haven't seen before (although the film does feature the scariest journey through an automatic carwash that we've ever seen).  But there is seldom much in the way of the truly new in this genre...it's all in the execution.  If the film is constructed well enough, we don't pay quite so much attention to some of the plot holes (or if not holes, at least areas the stretch credibility, even if we accept the initial premise).  THE CRAZIES is well-constructed, and uses its modest budget well.  It doesn't attempt anything it can't pull off well, so there aren't lots of cheesy effects.  It assembles a small core of characters, and makes us care about them just enough to draw our sympathy at their plight.<br /><br />The central relationship is between sheriff Olyphant and his wife, the town doctor, played by Radha Mitchell.  They are a couple that has clearly been together for awhile, and there are no big histrionics between them.  They feel like a couple that has a natural ease between each other, and even when pushed to extremes, there's never any doubt that they're comfortable.  This reflects the overall ease of the movie...it doesn't push too hard.  Olyphant and Mitchell feel more like a married couple that is comfortably at ease with each other...not the typical movie couple who always have to find a way to tear each other's clothes off and fool around, even as the world collapses around them.  I liked that...and it made me really root for them.<br /><br />In many ways, the most interesting relationship is between Olyphant and his deputy, played by Joe Anderson (ACROSS THE UNIVERSE).  Their interplay, the casual deference of the deputy for his boss, their unshakeable sense of duty all feel natural.  These are good guys...but in quiet, unassuming ways.  They just do what they feel is right, even if they're really scared.  The movie is not showy about them...it's not like their Mel Gibson & Danny Glover in LETHAL WEAPON...they're just a couple of small town law enforcement officers who wear their badges not only with pride but with an instinctive understanding that they have RESPONSIBILITY as well.<br /><br />The movie has scares aplenty, and lots of tense scenes.  There's a great scene in the latter half when the couple is confronted by a couple of crazies in their own bedroom...we've got four people basically clawing and scratching at each other in a tiny room, and it's maddening to watch.<br /><br />It's nice to see a good, honest little film that knows its business, but takes the time to get enough little details right to make it just a bit more than ordinary.  If you're in the mood for a few jump-in-your-seat moments, you could do far, far worse than THE CRAZIES.</p></body></html>

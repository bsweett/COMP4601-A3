<meta name="summary" content="No need for the remake"></head><body><p>This is an interesting story, but the 2009 version was just fine in it's original version from Sweden. I see many people on here talking about how this is different from the first film. I have seen both of these back to back and I can't see the need to remake it.  It is virtually scene for scene the same as the original, and the quality of the film used, sound, and lighting even feel the same, if not worse.  The only thing they did was bring in bigger actors, namely Daniel Craig, Stellan Skarsgard, Christopher Plummer to name a few, then made them speak English with an accent to make it sound Swedish to apparently make it more appealing for the US audience.  Also had a bigger budget, but all they spent it on was actors and trent rezonor to do the soundtrack, just superfluous spending that added nothing for me.  Really no need to do so.  I watched the original with subtitles, and the English overdub was not bad when I tried it.  Again, interesting enough movie, worth a viewing if you are a fan of the series, but don't get your hopes up for something different or better.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good premise, great actors, mediocre presentation"></head><body><p>Sarah Huttinger (Jennifer Aniston) suspects that her granny, Katharine Richelieu (Shirley MacLaine) is Mrs. Robinson; Coo coo ca-choo. To make things worse this leads her to believe she may be the offspring of a different union (the timing was right).<br /><br />The film is about Sarah's search for the truth and the people she encounters.<br /><br />People watched this for different treasons some watched for Jennifer Aniston of "Office Space" fame. Others said "who is Jennifer I am watching for Shirley MacLaine. Still others were intrigued with where the story was going. They used ancient phone technology to give the film a period piece feel.<br /><br />In the end the presentation was trite and forced with little chemistry or surprise.</p></body></html>

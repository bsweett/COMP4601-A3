Liam Neeson (one of my favorite actors) is sensational as /Bryan Mills, an ex-spy who singlehandedly undertakes a perilous rescue mission to save his estanged daughter who has been kidnapped by a ring of slave traders. He is relentless, fierce, methodical and cold blooded as he dishes out the same level of pain and punishment practiced by those he pursues.<br /><br />'Taken' is not a film I would suggest for an evening of family entertainment, but if you have a group of guys together who want to see fists flying this is the one.</p></body></html>

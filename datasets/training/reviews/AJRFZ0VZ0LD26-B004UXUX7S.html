Clooney has made quite a few good films in the last several years and I am glad to see that he is not loosing his stream.  His performance is wonderful, but movie itself falls a little short.<br /><br />It is a story about the man who is native Hawaiian and lives somewhat modest life compared to the wealth he inherited.  He is a lawyer, specializing in real estate in charge of the land trust that his family owns.  On the surface is life is perfect: he has nice law practice, wife and two daughters.  One day tragedy hits home and his wife ends up in a coma.  It is during her hospitalization that he discovers she had a well kept secret from him that changes his entire outlook on life, marriage and family.<br /><br />Like any encounter with death, family members need closure with the person that is dying.  This family goes through that process with close family members, friends and grief councelors. No matter how difficult the truth is for this man who is loosign his wife of nearly 20 years, he pulls through it and carries on with whatever is left.  It is the story of endurance, during most difficult times and story of a family capable of finding their peace once the trauma of loosing one of their own is over.</p></body></html>

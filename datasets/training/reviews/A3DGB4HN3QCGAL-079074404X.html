<meta name="summary" content="It belongs in any SciFi collection"></head><body><p>I'd seen this movie on TV a few times over the years and always meant to get myself a copy. The story does have it's plot holes but is still one of the best scifi movies out there, even if it is 50 years old now. Most of the movie actually makes sense! In one scene there's a hologram of Morbius' daughter Alta- it wasn't called a hologram (and wasn't due to be invented for years yet) but that's just a small example of the vision they had in creating this thing. Almost the only appearance complaint even after all this time is the look of some of the outdoors shots and a few of the Krell equipment scenes (in those days it was all handwork and models, no computer effects, so it all looks very well indeed).Any collection of science fiction ought to have it, maybe any film collection period.<br /><br />The Ultimate Collector's Edition came out recently so I decided to get that. The movie is supposed to have been remastered, the sound is great but I thought I saw a little color shifting sometimes, like the color adjustments weren't perfectly even. I didn't like "The Invisible Boy" very much (I think I saw part of it on TV years ago)- kind of a 12 year olds plotline, the Thin Man TV appearance of the Robot was more interesting. Forbidden Planet itself is the only thing on either disc that is captioned or subtitled- would've been nice to have that on some of the extra's.<br /><br />It was interesting to see how many of the cast/crew are still living- including the robot creator and the wife of the husband/wife sound FX team. Some of the deleted scenes and lost footage (most of this was just test shots) looked very interesting but none of that stuff was restored- some of it looked like it was a worn video of a worn piece of film it was so fuzzy or scratchy.</p></body></html>

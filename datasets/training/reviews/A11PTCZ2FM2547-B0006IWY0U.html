Case in point:  MASTER AND COMMANDER:  THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD, Peter Weir's epic depiction of life at sea in the early 19th Century.  Here we find gritty authenticity where absolutely nothing is spared, from the suffocating stench of below decks, to the mirth and mayhem of the ship's officers dining together, to the brutality of hand-to-hand combat as one ship overtakes another.  It's all as believable as it is spellbinding, as we follow HMS 'Surprise' as it plays a cat-and-mouse game across two oceans with a vastly superior French frigate.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is the headliner playing Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey, a most approachable commander with a winning disposition paired with astonishing resolution; Captain Aubrey is going to take the French ship, dire consequences or no.  This often puts him at odds with the ship's surgeon and Jack's personal friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany); Maturin serves as a sort of barometer for the crew, and is allowed to be upfront and frank with the captain.  These exchanges create remarkable tension, as both men have unwavering mutual respect.  Meanwhile we're privy to the ongoing adventures of the 'Surprise' as it sails the Atlantic, rounds the Cape of South America, and heads into the immense waters of the Pacific; from battle to meatball surgery to topsails to camaraderie to rigid discipline to the sailors' infatuation with superstition.  The cast playing the crew is stellar, including Billy Boyd (who will always be known to me as Pippin).  MASTER AND COMMANDER:  THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is an engrossing and enchanting tale, enthusiastically recommended for all movie buffs.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.</p></body></html>

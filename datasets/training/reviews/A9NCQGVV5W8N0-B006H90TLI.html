Beautifully shot and brilliantly acted. I've read a couple of Cormac McCarthy's books - the one that this film is based on isn't one of them - and the Coen bros. perfectly capture his pared down, lyrical prose onscreen. Something I never would've thought possible. Much has been written about Javier Bardem's granite faced killer (although in fairness, to describe Anton Chigurh as granite-faced doesn't really do him justice: he looks like he's been hewn out of the side of Mount Rushmore) and its all true, it really is one of the greatest onscreen portrayals of a psychopath that you'll ever see; as convincing as Ben Kingsley's turn in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UV33">Sexy Beast</a> and Brian Cox's turn in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008V5RP">Manhunter (Restored Director's Cut Divimax Edition)</a>, albeit in a completely different way. That said, its really wrong to single out just one performance because the ensemble cast are all note perfect. In fact, what you have here is a synergy of visuals, acting and direction that you rarely see coming out of American cinema in this day and age. I also absolutely adored the complete lack of a score. Its cinema which refuses to concede to the laws of genre or the insidious influence of a marketing demography that has ruined so much western cinema in the last thirty years. I'm not sure that I believe in cinematic perfection, but if I don't, this comes damn close.  Will you get anything out of it? Well, if you can't pick up on the unspoken undertones of threat that can occur in an apparently innocuous conversation between two men discussing the toss of a  coin, then probably not. If, however, you can see what's going on beneath the surface of things, you need to rent or buy it right now</p></body></html>

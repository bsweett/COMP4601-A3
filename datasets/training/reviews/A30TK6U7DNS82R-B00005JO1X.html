<meta name="summary" content="Get Her Some More Teeth"></head><body><p>We saw this last night in a crowded theater and I was fairly underwhelmed, but maybe if I hadn't read the book I would like it more?<br /><br />Perhaps an extended version would have played better, because the nagging feeling never left me that something was missing.  I could have used some more establishing scenes that showed the Pevensie children having some camaraderie with the creatures of Aslan's army, in the days before the big battle.  As it is, they just sort of swan in and everyone bows--why?  Just because they're human?  Why would all these beasts and centaurs and fauns etc fight for four little humans to conquer them all?  In the book it was sort of explained, and part of that was a certain amount of interchange among all the species, not just the girls playing and the boys riding talking horses.<br /><br />Compare that to the slow-paced, but ultimately worth it bonding scenes in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and you have an idea of what the emotional payoff might have been for NARNIA.<br /><br />However that said it was a spectacular film with some great action sequences, especially trying to cross the river before it melted, a scene which brought back ancestral memories from the very first days of cinema, when Lillian Gish floated on the ice in D W Griffith's WAY DOWN EAST, which this film seemed to be quoting.<br /><br />I didn't like any of the children very much.  Can't wait till that little girl grows up and the gap shrinks between her three front teeth.  I couldn't bear to look at her except when she was crying and that made me feel like a perv.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton put a lot into the part!  Probably more than was in the script.  When she made her triumphant speech on the stone table about the return of "deep magic," she might have been louder, like take some voice lessons or something, she just didn't have the vocal power to shriek it out at the end; but in every other scene she excelled my highest expectations.  At the end of the movie we voted to award her the Oscar for best actress and to give a special award to the NUT who designed her winter and summer wardrobes.  They were eye popping, Leigh Bowery would have been proud.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Really?  Your actually taking this movie seriously!?"></head><body><p>I saw this movie with low expectations and had a great time.  The effects are amazing, its made by Roland Emmerich, and the effects are amazing.  To all of those who are breaking this down and stuff stop.  This wasn't meant to be taken as a great docu-drama, go see An Inconvienent Truth.  This was made to be a silly, fun, popcorn type movie.<br /><br />Watch this and take it for what it is.  It sucks when people break down movies that are just supposed to be fun.  No plot is right.  But I had a  helluva good time!</p></body></html>

Produced by Guillermo Del Torro it still has dark tones similar to the ones we say in "Pan's Labytinth".  Some of the scenes are just too gruesome, even for the adults to watch.  We meet Laura, a woman who used to be orphan herself who now has adopted son Simon with potentially fatal desease.  Simon is a sensitive and lonely child and he has imaginary friends.  But when the circle of his imaginary friends starts to grow, his worried parents arrange for the children's party in their new home that used to be an orphanage where Laura grew up before she herself was adopted.  Before long, Simon disappears and police has no clues on his whereabouts.  The love that Laura feels for Simon is unconditional.  She wants to find her little boy no matter what the cost.  It is at that point that we see what a true motherly love is.  It is also heartbreaking after we learn that Simon's desappearance and ultimately his death is partially her fault too.  I liked film's idea on how living family left behind has strong ties with people they were close to once, long gone.  Just as Laura has strong impressions of her son being around, so does Laura's husband about her presence once she is gone to another world.  The bond we have with certain people is unbreakable between the two worlds.  It is there to sustain us in times of grief and emotional pain.  Not as powerful as "Pan's Labyrinth" but very touching nevertheless.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Perhaps Better if You're High or Tense?"></head><body><p>Absurdly unrealistic thriller, but entertaininging nonetheless. And I was neither high nor tense as I watched.<br /><br />Without giving the twist away, let me just say that I was questioning some of the holes in this flick prior to "the big twist". Then came the twist and the whole movie collapsed like a house of cards in a hurricane.<br /><br />There's suspense (in the start of the movie), there's a decent storyline (in the start of the movie), there's pretty good acting throughout the movie, but don't buy this...it's not a keeper unless you collect gore (and absurd stories).<br /><br />It's the the story of a family's house-guest that witnesses the family's brutal murder; the guest hides during the murders, then follows the murderer during "his" escape. That's when...well...that's all I'll say. But let's put it this way: The movie is pretty good up until the last half hour when the hurricane blows in to knock down the house-of-cards-plotline into the abyss of the absurd.<br /><br />I must say that for the amount of time that I was entertained it's worth a rental. But even if you don't mind burning the cash for a purchase of this silly frightfest...your first viewing will likely be your last.<br /><br />Rent it. Don't buy it. Sorry Amazon.</p></body></html>

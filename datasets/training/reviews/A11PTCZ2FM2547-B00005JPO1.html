Look, I realize following 'The Last Crusade' is a tall order--even almost 20 years later.  And Harrison Ford and Karen Allen are definitely showing some mileage, but they still deliver their roles (especially Ford; no other sixtysomething actor could have pulled it off).  The one word I associate with the Indiana Jones franchise is Fun.  The first three were grand fun.  And so is this fourth installment, where this time, instead of the menacing Nazis, the villains are Soviet operatives, led by Comrade Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, sporting a coal black bob and heavy Russian accent, is priceless), racing Indiana into the Peruvian wilderness to find a treasure of gold that has extraterrestrial ramifications.<br /><br />And like all the predecessors, CRYSTALL SKULL is grand, seat squirming fun, from surviving an atomic blast to evading some nasty ants with serious attitudes.  And throughout, Ford is vintage Indiana Jones, escaping peril after peril with a smug quip at the ready.  With Indiana, humility is always right around the corner, and that's certainly the case with this fourth installment.  Other noteworthy roles are turned in by Ray Winstone and John Hurt; the weak link (as in all his films) is ghoulish Shia LaBeouf, playing young Mutt, a faux rebel who soon learns an extraordinary (yet not surprising) secret.  When LaBeouf makes his entrance riding a motorcycle and sporting a police cap ala Marlon Brando, I was doing some serious eye-rolling.  Yet even his inherent floundering takes little away from my enjoyment of this film.  INDIANA JONES & THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL may be far removed chronologically from the first three installments, but it more than holds its own being worthy to join this illustrious franchise.<br />--D.

<meta name="summary" content="Welcome To The World of Clive Barker...4.5 stars"></head><body><p>HELLRAISER is one of the creepiest films made by Clive Barker. While he's best known for helping to write CANDYMAN, it's the HELLRAISER saga that brought his name into the limelight. Boasting one of the most infamous of horror legends (Pinhead), HELLRAISER established Clive Barker as a tour-de-force director of the horror genre. Clive was quoted as saying he tried to check a book on film directing in from the local library, "and they had two, but they were both checked out. And I thought I'm so f---ed, I don't even have a book." Nevertheless, HELLRAISER was one of the best horror films to come to life. Bringing the idea of s&m to the horror genre was unsettling, as HELLRAISER really explores the idea of what pleasures and pains await certain people.<br /><br />The catalyst of the movie is a puzzle box, which opens up a gateway to true hell, one where pain is the ultimate pleasure awaiting its victims. Kirsty (played by the beautiful Ashley Laurence) has found her own place, but is having some wicked dreams. Her parents have moved into a house with a dark secret: Frank (brother of Larry) was killed in this house by the box, and the inhabitants (the Cenobites) have ripped him to pieces. Now after Larry suffers a fairly nasty cut from moving, the blood that drips on the floor of the infamous room awakens Frank from under the floor, and the transformation is one of the creepiest, sickest things. But the visual of it is astounding, and no doubt one of the film's strong points. Frank is now transforming, and he needs Larry's wife Julia to help him. One by one, she brings home strangers posing as a prostitute, but each victim is beaten until Frank sucks them up to help reshape his body until ultimately, he's his old self again. But no one's ever escaped from hell, and when the Cenobites along with their dubious leader Pinhead (played magnificently by Doug Bradley) are hunting him down, Kirsty strikes up a deal with them to bring him back. However, it's going to be real hard after Frank takes over precious dad's body and Kirsty, after time, realizes it. She has to sacrifice dad to save her and put the Cenobites away for good. The ending of the film subsequently leaves the film open for the next chapter. This sick little gem brought Clive a little success, and championed seven sequels that would ultimately follow in its wake. While none would match the success of this cult hit, HELLRAISER is the best of the bunch.<br /><br />So if you want a good horror film with good monsters, creepy visuals, sturdy acting, and good direction...try HELLRAISER. The transformation of Frank will send chills down your spine, and no doubt the ruthless Pinhead should give you reasons to think twice before playing with strange puzzle boxes. In the world of HELLRAISER, there are "such sights to show you".</p></body></html>

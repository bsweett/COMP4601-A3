He plays an undercover FBI agent who's cover<br /><br />is blown and pays the ultimate price.  In the comic it was his wife and children who were destroyed by the mob.  This film shows his whole family; aunts, uncles, cousins being shot by assassins.  This film even has Roy Schider of Jaws and French Connection fame playing a bit part. I didn't expect to see poor Roy as a casualty in this movie.  It's too bad he didn't get a better role.  The movie might have been better with him as the black hat role instead of Travolta.<br /><br />Travolta I have to say didn't get this role too well.  He didn't play it like Roy Schider might have because he's a bit more seasoned.  I'd have to say the movie was good; had good action scenes, however Travolta was miscast.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Overrated thriller"></head><body><p>I enjoy a good suspense movie and especially enjoy the works of Hitchcock.  When I finally had an opportunity to watch The Third Man, I was prepared to be delighted, having heard so many good things about the movie.  Unfortunately, I found the movie to be just okay and far from spectacular.<p>There were three essential flaws in this film. For one thing, Joseph Cotten, the hero of the story, is basically unlikable and his motivation to find the killer of his friend Harry Lime hardly is enough to motivate the viewer to care.  Secondly, the musical score is not only the same basic tune throughout the movie, it has no relation to the mood of the scene and in fact, its light tone often contradicts the seriousness of the scene.  Finally, this is a movie that is overdirected, with some shots at strange angles for no special reason.  Probably Carol Reed's direction is in fact the main flaw that is responsible for the other two.<p>The story itself is okay, written by Graham Greene who adapted it from his own novel.  Some of the scenes do look nice and the look of postwar Vienna is appropriately glum. Nonetheless, this seems like someone trying to make a Hitchcock movie without really succeeding.  Perhaps in some alternate universe, Hitchcock did direct this movie and it turned out well; in this universe, however, we must settle for this one.</p></body></html>

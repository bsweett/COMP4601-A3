<meta name="summary" content="So bad it was almost good"></head><body><p>This movie uses every cliched idea ever about a female action hero who is out for justice.  Why is she so pissed off? She got a disease that turned her into a hemophage (aka not human) and the government killed her baby. What's she going to do about it? Kill all humans.  How? By strutting around in midriff-baring spandex and wielding guns and knives while never breaking a sweat or messing up her hair.<br /><br />It's almost ridiculous how bad this movie is, to the point where it was almost good because I wouldn't have thought you could shove so much garbage into an hour and a half.  Boy was I wrong! Catwoman, Queen of the Damned... not even close. This movie looks like a video game half the time and has so many pauses for effect, I think there's more silence than sound (music not included). And then there's the snappy dialogue.  I mean, with lines like "Killing is what I do. It's what I'm good at," and "You got hemo blood on me. It is on," how could this not be the gem of contemporary vampire cinema.  If you're in the mood for a laugh, you should rent this movie. But if you're in the mood for a decent action movie, look elsewhere.</p></body></html>

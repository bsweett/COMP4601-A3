<meta name="summary" content="Finally a DVD worthy of the movie"></head><body><p>Warner's newly restored and remastered version of the 1956 John Ford-John Wayne masterpiece finally brings home the film in an approximation of its original theatrical glory. Colors are remarkable, and images seem complete. Owners of previous versions should upgrade without hesitation.<br /><br />Peter Bogdanovich, the dependable (and prolific) DVD commentator, says "The Searchers" is "as good a Western as Ford made, maybe the best." "It's amazing how it was overlooked in its day," Bogdanovich says.<br /><br />Directors Martin Scorsese, Curtis Hanson and John Milius participate in a half-hour appreciation included as a DVD extra. All three dwell on the dark side of the film, whose treacherous crosscurrents include rape, sexual slavery, the slaughter of innocents, Old Testament vengeance and omnipresent racism. Few films burrow so deep into the audience's primal places. Even today, after viewing the restored film, Scorsese finds it "very disturbing."<br /><br />New-to-DVD extra features are the Bogdanovich commentary, a needless introduction by Patrick Wayne and the excellent half-hour "An Appreciation." Ported over from previous videos are the jittery Ken Burns-like docu "A Turning of the Earth" (Milius narrates) and a handful of "Behind the Cameras" TV puff pieces from 1956 with Gig Young. Warner had no alternate takes or deleted scenes to display, typical of the efficient Ford, Bogdanovich says.<br /><br />"The Searchers" comes in two double-disc sets with identical content on the DVDs. The "Ultimate Collector's Edition" adds only print materials, including reproductions of the 1956 tie-in comic and the original press book, along with some unremarkable memos and postcards.<br /><br />There is a good deal of repetitive material in the extras for this title and some of the other Wayne-Ford releases -- images, clips, stories -- but most viewers won't mind. Unfortunately, there's nothing on the music in Ford's films, such as Max Steiner's score for "The Searchers."</p></body></html>

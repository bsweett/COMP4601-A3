I absolutely loved "Hot Fuzz" and will definitely be getting the DVD. Pegg has shown some maturity and chops development and continues to make me want to see him in more roles. Wright is a competant actor as well and I'm sure they will both go on to bigger and better roles. This particular comedy had much more development and far more funny moments than "Shaun of the Dead". So along with the great acting from the cast I must applaud the writing and directing behind it. This is the funniest movie I have seen in a couple years. There are some obvious spoofs of movies like "Point Break" and "Bad Boys" which they even watch one evening.<br /><br />An officer, played by Pegg, that had graduated at the top of his class, is so good at his work in London they don't want him making the rest the service looking bad. They send him off to a rural town to get him out of the way. Wright plays the officer that is his partner at the town. The rural town seems peaceful enough and at first it seems the worst he can expect are some unruly kids. But murders soon start occurring and his investigations run deeper than he ever imagined. A sinister plot becomes evident and he must declare war and go no holds barred into the town to see that justice is served. If you enjoy cop movies or comedies be sure to catch this wonderfully funny movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Le Carr&eacute;, American Style"></head><body><p>Though not for all tastes, "The Good Shepherd" (2006) is an engrossing spy drama in the John le Carr&eacute; tradition. Director Robert De Niro gets the most out of his well-cast ensemble, with Matt Damon remarkably effective as the emotionally cold CIA operative and co-founder. Running nearly three hours, the film's leisurely pace works in its favor - chronicling the CIA's evolution from 1939 to the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961. Hopefully, De Niro will continue to explore this fascinating saga in his next directorial project.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Confound you, ambitious filmmakers!"></head><body><p>NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is arguably the greatest horror film of all-time, and easily one of the most influential ever made.  However, this DVD does NOT contain the true version of the film.  Despite the fact that it includes a couple nice special features, this version of the film is for die-hard Romero fans only.<br />The film has been re-edited, with new, completely unnecessary scenes inserted; also, Scott Vladimir Lacina has replaced the popular score of library music from the first film with a new score.  John A. Russo lead the project, and said he was surprised by the reaction of fans.  Well, nice job, Mr. Russo, you damned the film straight to hell.  I cannot tell you enough times not to purchase this edition.<br />Confound you, ambitious filmmakers!</p></body></html>

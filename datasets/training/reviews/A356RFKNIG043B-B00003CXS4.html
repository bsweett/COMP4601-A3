<meta name="summary" content="Loads of style and fun"></head><body><p>Ritchie hits another homer with this one. His unique cinematography, cutting, and balls-out style works perfectly here. If you like Lock, Stock, you'll like this.<br />Rather violent, but Ritchie has a gift for making violence seem entertaining in an odd way, and I'm no fan of violence in general.<br />Some truly funny characters and lines. Pitt is quite humorous; love the accent.<br />Helps if you know London and its hooligans, but if not, you'll learn about them here.<br />Compare this to most modern Hollywood shoot-em-ups and it becomes clear how much better films can be if someone with vision is making them.<br />Especially if he has a sense of humor.</p></body></html>

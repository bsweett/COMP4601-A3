It's a thing of beauty," Jenna is told by a regular customer of Joe's Diner when she produces another one of her tasty pies. The same goes for Waitress, the last movie to be written and directed by Adrienne Shelley before her death earlier this year.  When Jenna, a small town waitress unhappily married to the boorish and controlling Earl (Sisto), learns she's pregnant, the last thing she needs is to fall for her handsome gynaecologist Dr. Pomatter (Fillion). But fall in love she does, which, along with Earl's increasingly jealous nature, hampers her dreams of escape. Waitress is one of those films that'll get funnier with every viewing and the extremely quotable dialogue and hilarious character idiosyncrasies all point to the fact that this is a cult classic in-waiting. Russell wins me over very easily. Russell is surrounded by sound character actors whose performances elevate them above mere supporting roles: Fillion can deliver a line, Sisto shows us both sides of a childish husband but it's Matlock's Andy Griffith that's in scene-stealing form as the tell-it-like-it-is, foul-mouthed Southern gent. With dialogue that's witty, sharp and observational without trying too hard to be either, and a love story that's achingly sweet and tender without pandering to cliches.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful people in not-so-beautiful situations"></head><body><p>Sip a nicely chilled glass of a really good chardonnay as you watch this: with its beautiful locations, gorgeous looking people, and cutting edge fashions, this simply isn't a movie to watch with a crumpled bag of Doritos.  The look and feel of the film aren't the only things that are sharp, either; the dialogue can give a ginsu knife a run for its money.<br /><br />In the end, I enjoyed this very adult drama, though at times the exchanges do feel a little bit obviously "written", and overall the characters are extremely self-indulgent.  Also, for those who care about such things, not everything works out well for everyone in the end, though it does for some.  To the movie's credit, though, even if a character deserves his or her bad fate, you still feel kind of bad for that character, thanks to the actors doing a good job creating well-rounded characters out of the generally sorry specimens they're handed.<br /><br />  Finally, the DVD offers a sharp yet warm image that really makes those scenes in the opera house bar and at the chic gallery exhibition (yes, it's that kind of movie, remember?) really shine.</p></body></html>

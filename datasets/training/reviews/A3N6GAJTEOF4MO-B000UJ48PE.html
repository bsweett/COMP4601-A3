<meta name="summary" content="Gives Us A Frightening View Of The Modern Psychi"></head><body><p>Now going into this film I expected to be grossed out and to simply be enraptured by how far Eli Roth could take the gore in this movie to try and surpass the previous installment. Aside from the "Gorno" aspect of this movie, this has a very frightening message to it. This shows how a persons mental psychi is different from how they may express it towards others. I wont say much more as it will give away the whole premise of the movie and that's something I don't want to do as this has a bit more of a story to it compared to the previous film.<br /><br />The movie starts out with Paxton (Jay Hernandez) who was the only survivor of the torture of the last film. It shows how he is coping with the trauma of watching his friends be tortured and killed and then himself experiencing such torment. The bosses of the Hostel catch up to Paxton and finally take him out to cancel the risk that he may reveal the sickening secret of the wealthy underworld.<br /><br />This film does have more of a structure to it when compared to the first one. Three girls are backpacking across Europe and they become friends with Axelle (Vera Jordanova) who we learn is affiliated with the boss of the Hostel. Axelle is simply leading these girls into a trap which would eventually end their lives. On another side of the movie we are introduced to two business men who bid on being the men who killed these women. One of them wants to do the killing to fullfill what he feels as a darkness inside him that will make him feared by his peers. The other is a man who is pushed into the act for the same reason to instill a sub-conscious fear within his fellow colleagues.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with the Hostel movies and are curious about them, then be warned. This film is extremely graphic with its no holds barred approach to blood and guts. It is a very entertaining film however and something that really makes you think and in a sense wonder if there are actually places like this in the world.<br /><br />A good film that I would really only recommend to those who are familiar with this genre of movie.</p></body></html>

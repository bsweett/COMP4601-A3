<meta name="summary" content="Not In My Back Yard"></head><body><p>An old dog professsional photographer temporarily bed ridden (due to an accident)(James Stewart). A junior socialite (Grace Kelly) looking to get hitched to old dog photographer. A back yard full of troubled `lonely crowd' urban neighbors in 1950's New York.  Bring in a salesman (Raymond Burr) neighbor (could it be Willie Loman going off the edge) in an unhappy marriage. Add in the master suspense director Alfred Hitchcock and you have the making of a classic suspense thriller.  The plot revolves around the clues picked up by Stewart as he, out of boredom or otherwise, hones in on the apartment across the way. By the time Stewart and crew are done old Raymond Burr is going to need more than Perry Mason to get out of this fix. A word on Grace Kelly. They say Prince Rainer of Monaco, her husband,  a man not known for showing emotion  openly cried when she died in that car accident long ago. Now I know why. Enough said.</p></body></html>

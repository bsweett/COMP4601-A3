<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating exploration of madness and the trauma of war"></head><body><p>Hard-drinking, migraine-suffering US Marshall Teddy Daniels is called out to Shutter Island when a violent criminal escapes from the mental hospital on the island. Teddy has problems; his memories of WW2 haunt him, as does the death of his wife in an apartment fire. He struggles to keep it together, as he wonders, privately, if he doesn't belong in a mental hospital himself. Teddy and his partner have to sift out the truth from fantasy as they interview the patients. But there is a common theme--the inmates are terrified, and there is a mysterious 67th patient who no one seems to know anything about. As they are drawn deeper into the asylum, toward Cell C, for the most violent patients, Teddy's grasp on reality slips further and further away.<br /><br />The character of Teddy is excellently played by Leonard DiCaprio; we feel his pain at his wife's death, share his trauma from the war; the dream scenes are particularly bittersweet and heartrending. And we get a glimpse into the horrors that passed as "medical treatment" in the 1950's.<br /><br />Shutter Island will constantly keep you guessing--what is real? What is sanity? How should the mental ill be treated? It is a thought-provoking and emotionally wrenching story that will stay with you for a long time.</p></body></html>

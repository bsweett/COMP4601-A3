<meta name="summary" content="Christopher Walken and Witty Dialogue Tainted By Juvenile Humor."></head><body><p>John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are lifelong friends and business partners who work as divorce mediators in Washington, D.C.  They are fairly good at what they do and seem to enjoy what they do.  The reason for this is that in the springtime they take off and travel around the country seeking weddings to crash.  It doesn't matter the ethnicity or culture of the people involved, they have an identity for each one.  Besides the free food and drinks, the reason the duo crashes these weddings is so that they can pick up women who have become sexually aroused by the weddings.  It's one woman after another and a seemingly neverending party.  That is until Jeremy convinces John to attend the wedding of the daughter of Treasure Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken).  It's a lavish affair and John becomes smitten with Cleary's daughter, Claire (Rachel McAdams) while Jeremy just wants to roll around in the hay with Cleary's daughter, Gloria (Isla Fisher).  John and Jeremy are invited by the daughters back to the family estate for the weekend and John begs Jeremy to go so that he can try to get to know Claire better, even though she has a jerk boyfriend named Sack (Bradley Cooper).  It's a weekend full of comic mishaps and misunderstandings that eventually leads to some sappy nonsense about love and relationships.<br /><br />WEDDING CRASHERS features a lot of situational comedy and is seeped in innuendo.  There's also some brief glimpses of nude women.  All of that appeals heavily to adolescent males and helped make the movie one of the top grossing films of 2005, led it to be named as one of "The 50 Greatest Comedies Of All Time" in 2006 by Premiere magazine, and gave both Wilson and Vaughn one of the biggest movies of their careers up to that point.<br /><br />But that's really all just fluff.  The main reasons to watch WEDDING CRASHERS is for the dialogue and to see Christopher Walken.  Props to writers Steve Faber and Bob Fisher (as well as Olson and Vaughn who adlibbed some bits) for giving Jeremy and John such witty diatribe throughout the film.  Whether it's about the virtues of not-dating, thoughtfully reflecting upon how to live a meaningful life, or a pontification about falling in love, WEDDING CRASHERS has some great dialogue to quote.  As for the other reason to watch, it's Christopher Walken. We should watch anything that man does. Enough said.<br /><br />I don't enjoy WEDDING CRASHERS as much as my brothers or some of my friends do.  It has some funny moments and I can see why it is so popular.  However, it's definitely not a movie for everyone.  That's not to say that I didn't like it, because that's not true.  I just don't think it's as funny as a lot of people think it is.  Still, it's still a movie that any serious movie buff should see at least once.  If nothing else, you'll at least have some great dialogue to bring up in conversations later.<br /><br />The DVD includes two commentaries, one with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, the other with director David Dobkin.  Also included are deleted scenes, two featurettes "Event Planning" and "A Crash Course in Wedding Crashing", and a music video from The Sights called "Circus".</p></body></html>

They begin corresponding to each other through a series of letters..... soon it is discovered that they are living in different time periods, with Bullock's character two years ahead of Reeves' character. Both characters are lonely and form a strong connection with one another through their letters to each other and pour out each of their feelings to each other. It is interesting to see how their relationship unfolds. They vow to find a way to meet each other and it is interesting how they end up connecting with each other in the future. Lots of twists and unexpected turns take place in this film. Highly recommend watching!</p></body></html>

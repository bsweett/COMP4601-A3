The 1959 version with it's comically outdated "special" effects and corny acting and dialog I was made to appreciate at least for the "gravitas" and dread that movie was so infused with. As a kid it was kinda heavy. You feel like your embarking on a very dangerous expedition. Which makes sense considering your going to the center of the Earth (although of course that is all that is sensible about this fantasy story). But if you do a story about people going through the Earth and repeatedly almost being killed you want to convey the emotion of people being terrified to death. Remember the music from the old movie? And the duck? No duck in this one. And no dread. Just a silly, mostly lighthearted second rate cgi roller coaster ride that isn't worth the price of a ticket.</p></body></html>

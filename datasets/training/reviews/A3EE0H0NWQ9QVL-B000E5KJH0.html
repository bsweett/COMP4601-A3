<meta name="summary" content="'Truth or Consequences'"></head><body><p>Sarah (Jennifer Aniston) flies cross country with her finance', Jeff (Mark Ruffalo), to be at her sister's wedding.  She narrates all her apprehension as she reflects that she has little in common with her wealthy Pasadena family.  Interlaced are scenes for the alleged inspiration of the movie, 'The Graduate,' and the key triangle romance between Dustin Hoffman's character, the mother and the daughter.  She believes she is the product of its inspiration.  This sets us up for a playful backdrop for the plot of 'Rumor Has It...'<br /><br />When she arrives all of her goofy alienation comes to haunt her, but it is during the wedding reception that she hears some suggestive information:  Her mother had an affair just before her wedding, and, doing some math, she calculates that her misfit status may be hereditary.  Her father may have been her mother's lover on a trist in Mexico just before she married.  Grandma Catherine (Shirley MacClaine) has all the low-down.  She has the year book that shows a picture of Class of '59 ladies' man, Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner), her mother's fling thing before marriage.  Most of the film sets up the funny investigation as she meets her mother's lover.  (She passed away neatly enough when Sarah was nine, so Beau is her only recourse.)  We get mixed messages, but Sarah is taken on flight, romantically and literally, by this jet-set philanderer.  The answers do come about with a telling confrontation between Grandma are 'her' ex-lover, Beau!  Then, one of the best scenes is saved between father and daughter.  Showing beautiful tenderness, Jennifer Anniston proves that she's an actress who can, as in can be more than a skillful hair-brained comic screen presence.<br /><br />Shirley MacClaine is always welcome.  This time she dials it up two notches as an even more abrasive part than her classic Aurora Greenway role in 'Terms of Endearment'.  Bluntly crude, Grandma Catherine is blurt-out funny as are many of the lines delivered in this warmly engaging adult comedy.  Kevin Costner takes a stepping stone to his comeback with his low-key, yet suave performance as Beau.  (Although I think he is even better in his latest adventure 'The Guardian'.)  The treatment of possible incest and infidelity during engagement is given both sensitive and comedic treatment.  Often cutesy, but never banal, 'Rumor Has It...' is a rejuvenating film.  Rob Reiner, as usual, delivers a heartwarming comedic hand, and it is to his credit that the world often seems like a  better place after watching another one of his movies.

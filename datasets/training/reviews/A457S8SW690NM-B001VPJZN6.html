<meta name="summary" content=""if I told you, you wouldn't eat it"( Hannibal Lecter)"></head><body><p>Red Dragon is my second favorite film from the Hannibal Lecter trilogy, the first being the silence of the lambs. This movie once again portrays Thomas Harris's novel which I just started reading. This is the first of the trilogy even though it was released last. This is when Hannibal Lecter is captured for the first time by William Graham played by Edward Norton. Anthony Hopkins is at his best while Harvey Keitel plays the best Jack Crawford yet. But of course, once in prison, Will Graham must interview Lecter, trying to find information on a new killer.<br /><br />Graham was on the verge of retiring when he decided to come back to the force. What's good about this movie is that it isn't disturbing like the other two, so a larger range of people could problably watch it.<br /><br />What distinguishes this one from the others is that you see the killer's battle against himself. Ralph Fiennes plays the killer with lots of force, and he tries to conquor himself and his anger. He basically does everything a painting tells him to do, but once he starts seeing a blind lady for whom he falls for, he tries to stop doing what he does.<br /><br />The movie has MANY amazing scenes and sequences and the conclusion makes your heart beat as much as the silence of the lambs did. It's not as good as the remarquable silence of the lambs, but saying that it's almost as good as it, that's pretty remarquable itself.</p></body></html>

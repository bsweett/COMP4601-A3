<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie, Solid Performances & Direction, Lots Of Action---I Enjoyed It!!"></head><body><p>For me, this film was well put together, the story was good,<br />the direction was sharp (The Hughes Brothers have proven<br />themselves to be capable and astute directors who show<br />amazing range and diversity at directing various film genres).<br />Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman and all of the supporting cast<br />turned in solid believable performances, there was lots<br />of action, brutal fight sequences, explosions, there are<br />even some comical moments. There's also a revelation<br />towards the end which will take you by surprise if<br />you weren't paying attention throughout the film.<br />I didn't go into this movie with any lofty expectations,<br />or comparing it to other post-apocalyptic fare, I just<br />took it for what it was worth and I was entertained.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good<br />story, good acting, action, and ultimately, entertainment.<br />If you are the type of person who expects every movie to<br />be "Citizen Kane" or like to pick every flaw in a film<br />apart, or have to compare it to something in the same<br />genre for it to make sense to you, then you probably<br />should skip this one!

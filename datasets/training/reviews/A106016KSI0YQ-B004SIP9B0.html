Even now, when it's possible to look at it with a bit more soberness, it seems pretty nifty. The whole idea of doing a serious and intelligent look at the function of the constitutional monarch in contemporary Britain during its period of greatest trial (the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the outpouring of grief it produced and its new demands for a response from the queen) is just about irresistible, and the performance of Helen Mirren in the title role is nothing short of astounding.  One of the key plot devices (the hunting of the giant stag, "The Monarch of the Glen," concurrent with the press and the Labor government's stalking of the queen) does come out as heavy-handed even more than when the film was released, and at times the film does seem a bit too much of a valentine to Elizabeth II. Despite her claims to her prime Minister Tony Blair of not going in for "glamour and tears" in moments of grief, we do get to see her suffering and mourning (both for Diana and for tradition) in private, and she's surrounded by such a pack of stiffs away at Balmoral that it's impossible not to feel sympathetic for her. The film conceives the other members of her family as strictly two-dimensional: Prince Philip (James Cromwell) is a sour bully, the Prince of Wales (Alex Jennings) is an opportunistic whiner, and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms) is an addled tippler. Compared with this lot, how could she help but come out smelling like a rose? Fortunately, Mirren is unafraid of bringing out the character's sourness when it suits her, and occasionally makes some wonderfully unexpected withering comments to her secretary (Roger Allam) and to Tony Blair (Michael Sheen, also terrific). Even though this is a plum role, Mirren is such a brave and strong actress that she makes even more of it than you'd think: she's absolutely marvelous in the final scene, where the hurt queen comes to meet with Tony Blair months after he thinks they have scored a victory with the public relations over Diana's funeral while she's still smarting from the wounds inflicted upon her by her people.<br /><br />The big disappointments with this DVD release are its extras. There are some lovely moments on the "Making of.." brief documentary where Mirren explains her approach to the character, but there should have been much more from her and Michael Sheen. There are two sets of commentaries, one from royal expert Robert Lacey that's pretty standard (explaining away all the minor bits of court etiquette) and one from the director Stephen Frears speaking with the screenwriter Peter Morgan that's nothing short of disastrous. Obviously Frears and Morgan did not prepare for the commentary properly and felt that they had said everything about the film that needed to be said, because they offer very few illuminations about their ideas behind the work or the acting and directing; instead, they natter on about such dull trivia as why James Cromwell wears two dressing gowns and how the rooms they used to stand in for the drawing rooms at Buckingham Palace look nothing like the real thing. They come across as every bit as self-satisfied and as unrevealing as the very people the story is about. So skip the commentaries, and stay instead with the fine film as it is.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Without a doubt, one of the greatest horror movies ever made!"></head><body><p>"The Thing" stars Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley and is directed by John Carpenter. Right from the getgo, you know that this is going to be an awesome horror movie. And if that's what you guessed, well you are indeed correct! "The Thing" is a movie that's the epitome of paranoia and claustrophobia. The movie takes place among the barren landscapes of Antarctica, and focuses around twelve men secluded in a laboratory in the middle of the frost and snow. Then of course, comes the mysterious threat of the Thing!<br /><br />There are so many good points of this movie, it's hard to pick just a few highlights. "The Thing" is one of those movies where everything is done right. From the characters, who are all likeable, down-to-earth men that develop their different personalities over the course of the movie. Then of course the ever-intensifying atmosphere of the film, which grows and thickens with the growing threat of the mysterious Thing. The setting is also great, showing the terror of being isolated in an area with something dangerous in your midst. And probably most apparent is the absolute brilliance of the special effects! Nowadays, it's not common to find a movie with such great special effects, as a good deal of would-be great modern horror flicks are ruined by half-done CGI. Don't worry here, though, because "The Thing" is fully loaded with awesome special effects that'll have you loving the movie even more!<br /><br />Overall, "The Thing" is, as I previously mentioned, one of those movies where basically everything is simply done right. I certainly think that this movie would earn its spot among the highest-ranked horror films of all time, and is a movie that is still enjoyable no matter how much it ages, or how many times you watch it. Highly recommended! Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></body></html>

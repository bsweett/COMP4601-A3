<meta name="summary" content="Not as Good as the Critics Say, but not as Bad as I Thought"></head><body><p>I finally got a chance to see this film last night and while I found the story amusing, it wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. First off, this is not a laugh out loud comedy. The humor is very subtle and will likely put a smile on your face rather than making you laugh for all to hear. The acting by the two leads is really good, even if the characters are totally unlikable. I don't regret renting this one, because to me it is better than most reviews here would indicate, but nowhere near the greatness that most movie critics claim it to be. Barely *** out of *****</p></body></html>

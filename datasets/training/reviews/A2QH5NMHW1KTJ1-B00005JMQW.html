Everything about this movie is outstanding and not for one moment do you really want to take your eyes off the screen. Without revealing any of the story plot, I can honestly tell you that it is incredible, especially the romantically plot between Peter Parker (Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Dunst), Harry Osborne's (Franco) quest to kill Spiderman, and Dr. Octopus (Molina) trying to capture Spiderman. Dr. Octopus is truly scary, and is a great villain in this movie and the Spiderman franchise as a whole. Even though I hope in part 3 Venom or Carnage appear.  Every actor was extraordinary in this movie, with each actor accurately portraying the emotions they should feel and also showing style during action scenes. Maguire has shown us before that he is an outstanding actor, and he has shown us again that he has the ability to do it. I don't know what to say about the visuals effects, except they are the greatest visuals and deservers an Oscar for best cinematograph. I never wanted to take my eyes off the screen because this movie literally looked that good. Kudos to the director as well, for he did an amazing job directing this movie and graphically making it the way it should look. Don't miss out on this movie....A MUST SEE FILM!!!!!!!!!</p></body></html>

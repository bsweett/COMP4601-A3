I read the novel, which is magnificent, and I had a tough time imagining how somebody could reflect Suskind's masterpiece on the screen, and make it justice. I am really glad I decided to go ahead and give it a try, since this is one of the best adaptations I have seen in my life, up to par with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATQJ">The Shining</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225857">To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)</a>. The way in which the director, Tom Tykwer, used the camera to convey a world of olfactory sensations was simply brilliant.<br /><br />This is the story of the abominable Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, who was born in 1738 in a putrid fish market and who had to fight for his survival right from the start. Rejected by his mother, who left him to die, he ends up in an orphanage where he has to endure abuse from his peers. When he is old enough he is sold as a slave to a tannery, but his willpower kept him afloat. That was not his only strength though, since Grenouille had a marvelous gift: his supernatural sense of smell.<br /><br />While working at the tannery he discovers a couple of things that will change his life: a perfume shop, and even more relevant, a woman with a magnificent scent. The latter generates an urge that has to be satisfied, so Jean-Baptiste follows the girl and ends up smothering and killing her. The problem is that after death the scent disappears. So now he has to find a way to preserve the object of his obsession, and his journey begins with the perfumer Baldini (Dustin Hoffman). Baldini has had his era of glory but he has been eclipsed by the brilliance of his competitor Pelissier. Grenouille and his unnatural ability seem to be the answer to all his prayers, or maybe not.<br /><br />Part of the reason why the adaptation of this novel works so well is the amazing performance of Ben Whishaw, who convincingly portrays the perturbed and immoral Grenouille. Whishaw is able to give this character a combination of obsession with his quest and nonchalance regarding the actions needed to achieve his goals. These are the things that make the main character of this story so complex and mesmerizing in the book. The supporting cast does not lag far behind, with a Dustin Hoffman that plays his role accurately and efficiently, and a Alan Rickman that infuses his character with the necessary emotion and desperation to make it believable. I recommend this movie without reservations, and if you have not read the book I urge you to do that too, since both experiences are highly enjoyable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Shrek the Third Movie Review from MoviePulse.net"></head><body><p>Bringing back the beloved, convivial green ogre, "Shrek The Third" neatly concludes the supremely entertaining trilogy. Introducing a slew of new twists on classic storybook characters, and a multitude of priceless pop culture references, this film proves that the third time's a charm. Unbelievably realistic animation, running gags and spoofs of popular movies along with a brilliantly upbeat soundtrack ensure this crowd-pleaser will delight the whole family. And the Gingerbread Man never gets old.<br /><br />Shrek and Princess Fiona are planning to go back to the comforts of their swamp when all of a sudden the frog King (John Cleese) croaks. Forced to either assume the throne or track down the last remaining heir, a boy named Arthur, Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots embark on a mission to locate the young hopeful. Meanwhile the unscrupulous Prince Charming amasses a group of dastardly storybook villains to take over the land of Far Far Away. Fiona must gather her princess friends including Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty to save their overthrown kingdom. Will Shrek bring back the next heir? Will Fiona rescue her people? Will there be a Shrek 4?<br /><br />For the third installment of the Shrek franchise, the distinctive characters really drive the plot. Almost a direct sequel to Shrek 2, the story picks up shortly after, employs most of the same personae, and revolves around a comparable plotline and the same villain, Prince Charming. Despite the story's familiarity, the grand assortment of characters is still entertaining to watch. Puss in Boots returns, and although he mainly reuses his best gags, including the wide-eyed begging glare, Antonio Banderas and the ingenious script ensure that he steals every scene he's in. Donkey is his usual annoying self, although here he's been toned down since the second film. And of course the Gingerbread Man is back, who is so risible that he deserves his own spin-off so we can enjoy his undoubtedly psychedelic solo adventures.<br /><br />Movie references and pop culture are a huge part to the Shrek franchise. "The Third" features spoofs of Rosemary's Baby, an unbelievably witty nightmare sequence, and homage to buster Keaton's collapsing wall stunt in which he remains standing through an open window. Dozens of one-liner jokes and running gags emphasize pop-culture and famous clich&eacute;s. At times it seems as if quirky quips comprise the entirety of the film and that if all the non-related jokes were removed, a movie might not exist beneath it. Certainly more interesting here and now, where a lot of the references are influential and relevant, the Shrek films will always be good family fun; their magic, however, might fade with the popularity of the subjects they mimic.<br /><br />Technically and visually, the Shrek films continually advance. Amazing, eye-popping graphics grace the screen, with ultra-realistic textures, shading and environments, as well as fluid humanlike movements and nearly flawless animation. Hilarious character designs come to vivid life with the stunning combination of aesthetic mediums and devices. Once again an upbeat and popular soundtrack garnishes the production and hilariously placed full-scale song-and-dance sequences enhance nearly every scene.<br /><br />Shrek 4 is already in the works, and while we certainly don't need it, if Dreamworks Animation keeps up the same fast-paced blend of humor, adventure and role-model-morals, it can't do us any harm. Shrek the Third perfectly matches its predecessors and, while equally as preachy, the entertainment value always remains high.<br /><br />- Mike Massie, MoviePulse.net</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="EASILY THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR !"></head><body><p>This may very well be Pixar's best film and that's no small feat.<br />I can't believe they could come up with such and incredible movie based on quiet a disgusting subject matter but there is no question the people at Pixar have pulled it off.  Ratatouille and the Toy Story movies are the only computer animated movies I can remmember in which I've found myself smiling from begging to end. My favorite scene was probably Remy cooking two omelettes, a large one for his friend, a small one for himself.<br />I love the fact that, unlike every other animated movie today, Pixar's have no current pop references and also unlike them, they will stand the test of time.<br />To learn the insipid Shrek 3 made more money than Ratatouille is frankly puzzling and I for one can not find any explanation whatshoever.</p></body></html>

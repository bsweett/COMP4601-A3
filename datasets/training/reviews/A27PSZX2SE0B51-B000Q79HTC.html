<meta name="summary" content="The Bourne Misstep"></head><body><p>It can be quite disappointing when an actor with screenwriter's talent gets himself tangled up in a genre picture.  Even more disappointing is when said genre picture proclaims itself to be a suspense thriller but turns out to be little more than a punch-and-kick actioner.  With "The Bourne Identity", little Matty Damon grows up, and it turns out that he has a little Steven Seagal in him.<p>That's not to say that "The Bourne Identity" is nothing more than schlocky summer fare.  It can be, at times, quite engaging and provoking.  It's premise -- CIA-trained super-assassin on the run from his former bosses, hampered by severe amnesia -- has a lot of potential for questioning the archetypal hero's persona, and tackling issues of identity.  It further proves the notion, also espoused by "Fargo" and "Insomnia", that the limited palette of beautiful snowy locales (Switzerland and France here) can be an intense and impressive backdrop for a thriller.  And it has a stab at the one storytelling device that I'm a sucker for every time: the unreliable narrator.<p>Damon, plays Jason Bourne, a character that is cold and calculating, but ever ready to spin himself out of his shell and knock the baddies around.  Some of the movie's best psychological moments actually come in these action scenes.  Bourne doesn't know a thing about his previous life, and seeing him realize that he's a lethal fighting machine, right at the moment when he needs it most, is quite thrilling.  Damon does a fine job in these scenes, pulling off both the tormented hero and athletic wunderkind portions of his character.  However, I would have liked to see him inject some more humour into the role.  The opportunities were surely there.  He plays paranoid and coiled the whole time, and after awhile it got grating.<p>One of the film's fatal flaws is that casts, and then wastes, a heap of wonderful actors.  Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles, all actors who've proven time and again that they can deliver interesting and complex performances, are asked to play mere plot devices here.  Cooper is the go-for-broke assassin team leader.  Cox is the worrisome bureaucrat.  Stiles is the prodigious tech-op.  None plays anything resembling a full-fledged character, although all are game in their attempts to flesh one out.  Most disturbing is the work turned in by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje.  He was always terrifying on HBO's "Oz" (as gang leader Adebisi).  But here he is terribly over the top and ludicrous as a recently deposed African dictator.  So much so that the friend with whom I saw the film leaned over to me, after Adewale's first appearance, and asked if we'd accidentally paid to see "Coming to America 2".<p>The one supporting actor who fulfills his/her role nicely is the thinking man's uber-babe, Franka Potente.  The star of "Run Lola Run" plays Marie, who in the hands of a lesser actress would have been little more than a cipher of a love interest.  But Potente injects her with tenderness and vulnerability, while also being sexier than I've ever seen her.  She and Damon have a few truncated love scenes, and what they share together is always sensual, without ever being blatant.<p>Director Doug Liman, whose work I admired in "Swingers" and found problematic in "Go", two movies more concerened with clever dialogue than swift fists, would seem an unlikely fit for a spy thriller.  But he does his best to lay back and let the story take shape.  The opening scene is played almost perfectly, giving the audience as little information as possible, but still allowing them to figure out that the floating body found by fisherman just off Marseilles has an even more terrible story to tell than first expected.  His camera work, for the most part, manages to capture the stunning and stark beauty of his locales.  Unfortunately Liman also, at times, feels the need to play with his new big-budget toys.  So we get a lot of flashy digital information flittering its way across the computer screen.  There's nothing more effective at taking the audience out of a visceral action sequence.  And during the lesser of those action sequences, Liman shows that he too has a bit of Steven Seagal in him (one such sequence has a quick succession of limbs bending in directions they weren't designed to go).  Alas, his editing and choice of close-ups sometimes caused problems: is that Bourne's leg being broken, or the operative sent to kill him?  It got quite confusing at times.<p>In the end, Bourne degenerates from being a perfect, but still humanly flawed, killing machine, to a capital-A, capital-H Action Hero.  Which is far from Damon or Liman's strengths.  I suspect that their instincts should have provided some room for doubt, but the audience never gets the impression that Bourne is in any real danger.  So a film that is still better than your average cookie-cutter spy picture becomes a minor disappointment for all the potential it wastes.</p></body></html>

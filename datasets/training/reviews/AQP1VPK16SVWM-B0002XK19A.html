<meta name="summary" content="Fighting crime doesn't pay the rent"></head><body><p>Taking issue #50 of "Spider-Man" as its starting point, Peter Parker decides he needs to get a life outside of Spider-Man. Parker discovers that crime never pays for the hero (or at least his overdue rent). Since he doesn't have time to do his college homework, is failing classes and no has relationship with MJ because of his alter-ego, Parker decides to give up the Spidey suit. When his powers begin failing him because of his indecision, it's the final web for Parker. Parker has lousy timing, though, as just as all this is occurring as Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina in a marevlously nuanced performance)one of Peter's idols goes mad and becomes a supervillain causing havoc. J. K. Simmons is hillarious as J. Jonah Jameson capturing just the right element of tabloid journalism (and the scenes at The Daily Bugle plays like a miniature screwball comedy that could well have been made in the 40's)that drives Jameson to make Spidey a villain. The rest of the cast from Maguire, Dunst, Franco all the way down to Rosemary Harris as Aunt May capture elements of what made the comic characters so compelling.<br /><br />With a witty script written by Alvin Sargent ("What About Bob?", "Julia", "Straight Time" and "Unfaithful" among many other scripts)and with contributions by other notable writers (Michael Chabon Pultizer Prize author of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay), "Spider-Man" soars precisely because of the issues that Parker faces. Sam Raimi's sure handed direction and visual effects that rank among the best  (although sometimes the CGI Spider-Man looks exactly like, well, a CGI representation of Spider-Man)keeps "Spidey-2" from being earthbound. "Spider-Man 2" visits familiar territory for super hero films (already visited by "Superman 2")but has enough originality to stamp the story with its own stamp. Is it better than the original? You'll have to decide for yourself as the first film was exceptional but "Spider-Man 2" at least measures up precisely because it's more character driven.<br /><br />Comparing the different versions of "Spider-Man 2" is a challenge (there's three out there in the US). The best looking of the bunch is the Superbit edition in which all the extras are shaved off with all the extra disc space devoted strictly to the high definition transfer of picture and sound. Not surprisingly, this edition looks and sounds the best with a crisper picture, sharper images and top notch sound that sounds only slighly better than the 2 disc convention set. The catch is that the Superbit Edition has no extras and is a single disc. You'd also have to have a top-of-the-line system to really, really appreciate the differences (although on a big screen TV you'll see some of them readily apparent). If the person you're buying this for is into the best looking and sounding digital audio and video, this is probably the edition to get.<br /><br />The 2 disc set looks pretty darn good with a high definition transfer that looks and sounds almost as good as the Superbit Edition. We also get "Spider-Facts" which is, essentially, a text only commentary track. While it occasionally has some interesting tidits about the film (and many outside of the film such as tidbits about New York City), it's dispensable. There's also a blooper reel which is amusing included on the first disc as well as previews/trailers for various films.<br /><br />The second disc (which could easily have been included in a deluxe 3 disc Superbit Edition set for videophiles)includes a stunning 12 part documentary that discusses the production of the movie from pre-production to the premiere. It's exhaustive and fascinating to watch all on its own as a documentary. "Ock-Umentary: Eight Arms to Hold You" (a rather witty reference to The Beatles' film "Help!") is also a very good documentary on the history of Doc Ock from his first appearence in Spider-Man # 3 to the 60's cartoons to how they adapted the character for the film.There's also a number of very good featurettes including a discussion of the women in Spidey's life (which is only appropriate as two women dominate his life and influence most of his personal decisions),"Enter the Web" uses multi-angle technology to give a glimpse behind-the-scenes of the shooting of the climax of the movie. There's also an art gallery of Alex Ross' paintings from the title sequence (which is used as a brilliant device to sum up the first film for viewers who missed it and reminding everyone of what happened). We don't get any worthwhile games (that's a definite negative for gamers who want to try "Spider-Man 2: The Game") but get a featurette on the making of the game. There's also the usual weblinks. Oh and if you click on one of Doc Ock's tentacles you'll find an Easter Egg showing a very funny practical joke director Sam Raimi played on actor Alfred Molina.<br /><br />The commentary tracks feature director Raimi, Maguire and the producers and there's also a separate Technical Commentary featuring effects supervisor John Dykstra and others discussing how they achieved the look of the film. For those folks who purchased this at Best-Buy early enough got an extra disc that had the VH-1 Special on the production of the movie. It's OK and more promo piece fluff than behind-the-scenes documentary.<br /><br />The boxed comes with the conventional two disc set (without the Best Buy disc which is a bit curious as it would have been a nice addition) plus a comic collector's dream team of 25 artists with paintings inspired by the film. There's a portfolio that allows you to view various scenes from conception to final product (which would have been put to better use on a multi-angle DVD for videophiles). Taking an idea from the re-release of "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" (a Raimi favorite), there's five postcard sized reproductions of the artwork used to publicize the film including the trio of promo posters that were plastered all over cities. Finally, there's a reproduction (reduced to fit in the set)of The Amazing Spider-Man # 50 issue that inspired much of the story. They probably also should have included The Amazing Spider-Man #3 where Doc Ock first appeared as well, but that's a pretty minor point.<br /><br />All in all,the last set makes the better Christmas or birthday gift for fans. Regardless, the film is the same just differing in presentation. "Spider-Man 2" has a number of detractors that don't care for it. They probably shouldn't buy the film or rent it. For the rest of us who liked it, this is an intelligent, fun film thats only major flaws is that it runs about 15 minutes too long.</p></body></html>

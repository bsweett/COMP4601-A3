<meta name="summary" content="Don't watch this movie uncritically"></head><body><p>JFK is brilliant filmmaking.  Innovative use of period stock, timeline distortion, flashbacks, and great acting all combine to immerse the viewer in a world that feels decidedly real.  Stone succeeded wildly in technically innovating his way to a new kind of cinema verite. The problem is, of course, JFK's just a movie, but the people it depicted (mostly) existed.  That immediately opens up Stone's directorial tour-de-force to criticism on grounds of accuracy.  There, it languishes in ambiguity and doubt.<p>Though Garrison only barely lived to see the film released, his colleagues at the time have since given interviews in which they described the characterizations of Ferry, Shaw and other principles as unfamiliar.  As another reviewer has pointed out, no mention is really made of Shaw's meritorious military service in World War II, nor is Garrison's characterization of Shaw as a "CIA operative" really challenged (he was never on the CIA payroll).  Likewise, the film fails to directly explore what happened to Garrison in later life, and how his theories about the assassination kept getting broader and less fact-based.  There's no discussion of the allegations of bought witnesses, flimsy evidence, or corruption which swirled around Garrison at later stages of his investigation, and which ultimately helped to lose him a re-election bid.  Garrison is merely portrayed as a quixotic hero tilting at government windmills.  <p>And indeed maybe he was.  Maybe the loss of David Ferrie (his star witness) was so devastating to his case that he tried to put it back together again, using flimsier evidence.  Maybe he really had a case and it just evaporated.  Or maybe, like some members of the Lousiana press were reporting at the time, he had nothing.  <p>JFK does little to settle the debate surrounding Jim Garrison.  If anything- and maybe this was Stone's point all along--it's just deepened it.  That escalating debate is mirrored in the emotions evoked by the film itself.<p>At its worst, JFK is seen to be dangerous, fact-starved propoganda.  Some have found it easy to compare Stone to the acclaimed German director, Leni Riefenstahl, whose stunning art glorified Hitler's regime at the expense of literal truth.  <p>At its best, Stone's vision is a dramatization of a few branches of the assassination story unknown to most Americans.  Prior to this film, many were unaware that there had been any sort of court case at all connected with the assassination, and that it might have led to a conviction, had Garrison been able to provide better witnesses.  It can be claimed that the many inaccuracies in the film are no more egregious than what generally happens in many historical dramas.  <p>Whatever faults there are in the facts on display, though, there is actual history in Oliver Stone's film.  It's just not the history of the assassination, or even an entirely accurate record of Garrison's investigation.  Rather, JFK's strength is in dramatizing some of the main conspiracy theories.  And if viewed as more allegory than fact--if Costner's Garrison is seen as a theatrical lens through which to view the various strands of conspiracy theory that have long floated around the assassination--then it works less problematically than if you try to see it as a definitive history of anything that happened in Lousiana or Texas in the 1960s.  <p>Fifty years from now, JFK will likely be seen as an accurate history of the way the assassination made people feel.  The assassination was the start of anger and rebellion against the government in America.  And, whatever its other faults, JFK shows why.  Even if many of the events in JFK aren't literally true, and real people take an unjustified beating in Stone's harsh light, Stone isn't exactly making it up.  He's putting on the screen the questions that so many Americans had then, and certainly continue to ask.  He doesn't arrive at his conclusions through meticulous academic research; Stone assumes, perhaps to his detriment, that Garrison and Marrs have already done his homework for him.  No, JFK Is history by reflection.  Stone has put a giant mirror in front of the American people and asked whether we like what we see.<p>[DVD Notes: Don't even bother with any other version but the new Director's cut.  Neither DVD version has any significant additional featres, but at least the Director's cut has 17 more minutes of footage.  It's very frustrating that the DVDs are so devoid of extra features, because there's so much that could have been included.  The only reason I'm taking a star away from this product is because of the inexplicably missing bonus material.]</p></body></html>

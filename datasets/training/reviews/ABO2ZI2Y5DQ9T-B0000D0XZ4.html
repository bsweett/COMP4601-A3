I thought he was not going to do anything wrong.  And I am sorry, but I was terribly mistaken.  Mr. Lee says here and there in the interviews to the effect that he saw something like Greek tragedy in "Hulk."  Excuse me, but Hulk is NOT a human being; it's a cultural icon.  You cannot change it like that.<p>The story is long, too long, showing how Bruce Banner aka Hulk finds his power and secret in the past, after being exposed to the deadly gamma radiation.  The first unwise decision is, the film goes all the way back to the time of his father (hence, Greek tragedy) David Banner, who must have done something to his son.  And his son comes to realize his tragic history ... wait, but the film is supposed to be about "Hulk," that "Incredible" Hulk?  So why take so much time to see HIM?<p>Anyway, Bruce Banner knows his physical change, so the military people (again) take advantage of his power, led by unashamedly banal characters such as Josh Lucas's selfish tycoon Talbot taking over the institute, where Bruce Banner is working with his love Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly).  Of course, after being bullyed, Bruce gets very angry ... finally.  It looks like years to reach there.<p>The rest of the story involves Hulk's fight against the army and the father, the latter played by hammy Nick Nolte.  The story is too predictable, even considering its comic book origin, and to make matters worse, the CGIs used to express the movements of Hulk need much improvement.  Actually, some of them are fantastic, when Hulk attacks the tanks and tears them apart.  But some of them are just awful, showing Hulk like a big green rubber ball bouncing up and down.  If that is intentional, I call it a misguided idea.<p>Australian Eric Bana does a fine work as Bruce Banner, convincing as a scientist tormented by his childhood memory, but to be frank, the rest of the cast is huge disappointment.  Ms. Connelly does nothing but worrying and crying, and that worrying is not particularly good.  Worse is her father Sam Elliott, whose "General" is nothing but a cardboard character.  Maybe that's also intended so.  But as to Nick Nolte ... well, his overacting just reminded me of the time when he was really cool.<p>In short, Ang Lee thinks too much.  Sorry to say this, but looking at the endless multi-screen shots that are made to resemble the pictures of the comic book, I have to say so.  Do we need that labored job that much?  Why cost so much pain there?  And misguided ideas like an exploding frog, which may make some of the viewers sick (I was).  Do we need that?  ANd that's when we want Hulk, incredibly angry Hulk?  Imagine this "hulk" was directed by some newcomer with MTV background.  The critics, who are inexplicably kind to this film, would hurl harsh reviews upon it.  And I think it deserves them.</p></body></html>

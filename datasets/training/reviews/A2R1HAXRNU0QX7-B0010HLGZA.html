<meta name="summary" content="The One we watch EVERY year!"></head><body><p>A true classic, in the best sense of the word.  It's not a "stuffy" classic that everyone admires but no one actually enjoys.  It's not a classic in that it's a movie your grandparents really admire...but you have no use for.  Another word for CHRISTMAS STORY would be "timeless."  I have seen this movie nearly every year since it first came out on the big screen 20 years ago.  I enjoy it EVERY TIME.  All the classic comic moments remain hilarious even now.<p>Tongue stuck to flagpole.  The bully with the yellow eyes...and his comeuppance.  The sexy lamp.  The frightening Santa.  It's all there.  Saying "oh fudge!" The movie had a beautiful feel of nostalgia when it came out, and it has the same feel today.  I think for many viewers, this movie has come to define what small town, depression era America was like.  Innocent in all the best ways.  <p>Oh, did I mention the dog and turkey scene?  Or the "how to the piggies eat" scene?<p>Anyway, this is the one movie about Christmas that everyone has seen.  I can mention it to people who think high-art is THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS and they recall CHRISTMAS STORY with fondness.  I can mention it to people who normally only see films with sub-titles, and they "ooooh" with misty eyes at their favorite memories.<p>Truly, there isn't a single scene in the movie that's stinker.  It's one of the leanest, meanest movies you'll ever see.  The fat was trimmed very well indeed.<p>Peter Billingsley as Ralphie is perfect in the role.  This kid is almost as big an icon of Christmas entertainment as the Grinch!  Darren McGavin, a favorite of mine, is just terrific as the crusty father with the flair for expletives.  The list could go on.  Not a single role is miscast or forgettable.<p>If by some chance you haven't seen it and can't decide whether you should or not...just go ahead and buy it.  Once you've seen the movie...it'll become a part of YOUR Christmas tradition too!<p>(One very tiny note of warning: the movie doesn't deal with the religious aspects of Christmas one little bit.  It is a totally secular holiday, if this film is to be believed.  If you want a show that remembers the Christ in Christmas...then the Charlie Brown Christmas special needs to be under your tree this year.)</p></body></html>

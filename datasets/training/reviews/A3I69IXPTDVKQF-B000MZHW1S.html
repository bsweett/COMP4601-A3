<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding Action/Political Issues Cross"></head><body><p>One of the best movies of 2006, "Blood Diamond" combines the action movie with the heart-rending 'issues' movie - films like "Hotel Rwanda", "Dirty Pretty Things" and "Rabbitproof Fence", which feature stories of real-life atrocities that have taken place or are still taking place.  The meld is extremely potent - the seriousness of the issues presented is never minimilized or brushed off, but the fact that the movie is a fictionalized account of a real situation provides for the welcome possibility of a somewhat happier ending for the innocents than usually happens in 'true story' movies like this, and the tantalizing lure that the heinous villains may not escape justice as they so often do in real life.  (On the other hand, "Blood Diamond" is grim enough that neither of those possibilities seems guaranteed, generating tremendous suspense).  On the action movie front, the fact that these bad guys are right out of the papers and evening news makes it impossible not to root against them with a particular vengeance.  The stakes seem much higher than in many action movies and have a profound effect on the heart.<br /><br />  Taking place in the '90s civil war of Sierra Leone, the "Blood Diamond" of the title refers to diamonds which, like many other valuable substances, have been mined in Africa by slave labor repeatedly in recent years to pay for war efforts on behalf of both ruthless rebel factions and brutal governments.  The diamond end of this appaling tragedy has to a large degree been cleaned up by the establishment of the Kimberly Process (designed to keep 'blood diamonds' off the open market) but the practice was in full swing at the time the story here takes place.  Djimon Hounsou plays the father of a family in a village where rebels come to abduct the population - to turn the young into brainwashed 'child soldiers' and to press many of the adults into slave labor in the diamond rivers.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays a smuggler/mercenary who has dealings with the rebel group, and who comes to a stage in his life where he has to decide if it's too late to try and turn away from the brutal way he's lived his life.  Jennifer Connelly plays a journalist in Africa trying to gather evidence to expose the blood diamond trade and its links to rich Western corporations.  Her character, Maddy, has piled up a track record of uncovering similiar abuses all over the world.  In an ordinary movie, any one of these three stars would steal the show, but in "Blood Diamond" all three lead players deliver astonishing performances.  So, in fact, does the entire supporting cast.  The discovery in the slave rivers of one of the largest diamonds in the world (worth millions) and, moreover, the quest of Hounsou's character Solomon Vandy to escape and rescue his family (including the son that's been taken by the rebels) and the various characters who risk their lives to help him, provide main points for the movie.<br /><br />  In terms of production, everything's perfect - the action sequences, the cinematography, the musical score, everything.  The lush natural beauty of Sierra Leone is captured amazingly well, and having such breat-taking natural imagery as the backdrop for such a brutal series of events is poignant, to say the least.<br /><br />  Excellent in every respect, one of the very best picks from a year that was loaded with great movies.</p></body></html>

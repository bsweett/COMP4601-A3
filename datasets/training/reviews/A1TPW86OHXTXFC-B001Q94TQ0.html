And they're on their way to New York in the stomach of a 17-year-old girl."<br /><br />Maria Alvarez, a seventeen year old from Columbia, is on a plane flying to New Jersey carrying her fortune in her belly. She is what is called in the drug business a "mule".  "Or they are called "swallowers," drug couriers who rent out their bodies as cargo containers, each carrying upwards of a kilo, or 2.2 pounds, of packaged narcotics. It's an old trick, body packing, but on the rise, and getting more sophisticated. Increased airport security has caused some drug cartels to shift a majority of their small shipments out of carry-on baggage and into the less easily searched internal compartments of the "mule."  Maria quit her job working on a flower farm where she was not treated well. She comes from a family of women, and she must provide some monies. Now, she is pregnant and without a job. She hooks up with a young man at a dance and he tells her about this easy money.  it sounds dangerous and it is, but what else does she have?<br /><br />So, here she is with her best friend another carrier and a new friend ,Lucy, who has "muled" three times. They are picked up at the airport and brought to a small apartment. Here they are given laxatives to move the drugs along. The people they meet with are cruel and without morals.<br /><br /> Lucy doesn't feel well, and this portends a tragedy. One of the packets must have opened, and is killing her with an overdose. In the night Mara hears noises, Lucy is missing, and the bathroom is full of blood. She and her friend pack and leave quickly They find their way to Lucy's sister's home in Queens. Lucy's sister opens her home to these strangers, thinking Lucy sent them. In time she finds out the truth ,and Maria and her friend are out on the street. They finally get their money and head back to Columbia, but  what is their future? Can Maria continue to mule and put her life in danger and meet with these animals who only want their drugs?  What about her baby, what will she do?. Can she return to her life she hated?  Maria at seventeen has grown into a woman and must make major decisions so that her child will have a future. This is a movie of truth and daring and poverty and last chances.  Recommended. Prisrob</p></body></html>

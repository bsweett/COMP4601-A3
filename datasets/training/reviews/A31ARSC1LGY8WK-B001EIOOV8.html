<meta name="summary" content="Another excellent "mob" movie from Scorsese"></head><body><p>"Casino" is a "mob" movie set in 1970s and 80s Las Vegas.<br /><br />It's from the same team behind "Goodfellas" - Martin Scorsese (director and co-writer) and Nicholas Pileggi (co-writer and writer of the original book) and even includes the incomparable Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in the lead roles. It is very similar in style and tone to this earlier film.<br /><br />This similarity detracts from its impact somewhat but "Casino" is still a  very good film. It contains many memorable moments, good music, and is stylishly directed by Scorsese.</p></body></html>

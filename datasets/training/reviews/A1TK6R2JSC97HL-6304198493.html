<meta name="summary" content="Not your usual movie"></head><body><p>A multi-layered story of rapacious greed and ambition, "Usual Suspects" puts together a great cast and a story-within-a-story plot.  The Suspects include Keaton (Byrne) a disgraced ex-cop; Roger "Verbal" Kint (Spacey), a club-footed petty criminal; Hockney (Pollack) the explosives expert; McManus (Baldwin) who's something of an explosive himself and Fenster (Del Toro).  I'm not sure what Fenster's role is, but given the hushed and marble-mouth tones that he speaks in, nobody else seems to know either.  The story is told in flashback by Verbal after the rest are either dead or presumed dead.  The film begins with the explosive destruction of a freighter in southern California.  Only one other man, the freighter's horrifically burnt passenger, survives.  He knows nothing of our heroes, instead ranting about "Keyser Soze".  Recognizing the name of an international criminal who murders almost on whim, and connecting him to the Suspects, a federal agent (Palmintierri) who's made a career of investigating Keaton, puts Verbal on the grill, forcing Spacey's character to recount how the boys came to know each other.  Gathered weeks earlier by the police as suspects or line-up fillers in the hijacking of a police truck carrying guns earmarked for destruction, the suspects (Verbal being one of the "fillers") are initially strangers, yet join together and form a plan.  Released when nobody gets pinned for the truck rap, the Suspects go into business - targeting for robbery various high-level smugglers who pay to keep the police at arms length.  Soon their rep brings them to the west coast, but we also learn that they had already come to the attention of Keyser Soze - by virtue of how their crimes have come at his expense.  Blackmailed by Soze through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Posthlethwaite, looking and sounding more Indo-Pak than Japanese), the suspects reluctantly follow his orders and shoot their way into a docked freighter loaded (says Kobayashi) with a fortune in cocaine.  By now, Verbal has recounted what he knows of Soze - less a man than a force of nature gone bad; a Hungarian criminal who killed his own family rather than let rivals hold them hostages against him; a mass killer who not only hunts down those who had tried to hold his family hostage, but their friends and families as well.  Soze's is the name that that career criminals utter to themselves when they need something to keep them up at night.<p>Okay, that's as far as I can go without spoiling it.  Sure, you'll probably figure out the big secret within the first few minutes (once a police sketch artist is brought in, the secret will practically leap out at you).  Nevertheless, the script works some great magic.  The ultimate trick isn't Keyser Soze secret identity but how the story gets you to root and care for a crew of wretched, murderous and greedy losers who'd be fodder in a more upstanding story.  The biggest mystery of all, when I saw it, was figuring out what kind of movie this was.  I had an idea that it would be some buddy-buddy picture of good-guy criminals - a sort of "Brinks Job" for the 1990's, but the result is much more satisfying.</p></body></html>

There's a few things I didn't quite understand --- like why didn't Spiderman get any billing, and why was his costume so loose-fitting and badly made?  I'm sure his role was significant, but you'll have to look hard, or you might just miss it. Luckily we've got dvd replay facilities these days: check out The Moment of Truth. And what's this place called OHLLYWODO? And then, obviously, what about that golfer? A guy with that handicap I'd like on my team.<br /><br />WILL SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT SPIDERMAN IS DOING IN THIS MOVIE?<br /><br />Well, come on people! Hasn't anyone else noticed Spiderman yet? He's there, in the street, for about three frames. Stop the action at the Moment of Truth. This is a great opportunity to make constructive use of that "Comment" box --- so far the only comments on my reviews that I've seen are completely stupid.</p></body></html>

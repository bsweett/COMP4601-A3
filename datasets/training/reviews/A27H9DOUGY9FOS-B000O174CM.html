<meta name="summary" content="No Surprise Here--"Dreamgirls" Boasts Dreamy Performances And Sounds Great"></head><body><p>"Dreamgirls" has finally arrived on the screen. After being touted all of 2006 as the film to beat come award season, the expectations within the industry seemed impossibly high. After unveiling a sequence at Cannes, the Oscar talk began in earnest--months and months before its release (or anyone actually seeing the final product). Can any film really sustain this type of hype? Does "Dreamgirls" live up to it? The answer is a qualified "No." But that doesn't mean that "Dreamgirls" isn't a worthy film, for it is. It is an extremely well made and beautifully performed movie musical. It isn't breaking any new ground, however--but very few, if any, films that year could have been the wondrous creation that insiders were expecting of "Dreamgirls."<br /><br />"Dreamgirls" tells the story of a girls' group (based loosely on the Supremes). The Dreamettes get their break singing backup to a legendary soul performer (played with gusto by Eddie Murphy). Guided by their manager (Jamie Foxx), the trio take the gig hoping to break out on their own. Effie, played by Jennifer Hudson, is ostensibly the group's leader as she is its frontwoman with an incredible singing voice. Also in the group is Deena, played by Beyonce. As Foxx positions the girls to be an act of their own, he asks Deena to step to the forefront as the most beautiful, and therefore commercially viable, asset of the group. This betrayal sets the stage for Effie's departure as she is relegated to singing backup for someone with less talent.<br /><br />The movie follows fairly conventional standards, the more successful the group gets--the more relationships suffer in the name of business. Foxx becomes the villain of the piece, and one by one, those who have been his allies fall by the wayside. The dramatics, especially in the second half, plod along at a predictable pace. It's here where the musical numbers rescue the picture. Where they are incorporated more effectively in the first hour, they become the whole movie near the end. So it's a good thing we have such a talented and engaging cast to keep us connected. Jennifer Hudson is a marvel, the movie (as the stage musical) clearly belongs to Effie. Eddie Murphy gamely triumphs. And Beyonce acquits herself well. Writing and incorporating her original song "Listen" into the musical's score gives Deena a soaring highpoint that she doesn't get on stage. Everyone in the cast is uniformly excellent.<br /><br />Of course, anyone familiar with music or musicals undoubtedly knows the signature anthem "And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going." Performed by Hudson as Effie is left behind, the song conveys so much emotion--pain and rage--that it is an instantly recognizable Broadway standard. Having won Jennifer Holliday a Tony Award as Effie, it is garnering many film awards for Hudson. If anything, though, the moment is so BIG--the number is actually a bit overproduced. With so many shifting camera angles, and a swirling crescendo of symphonic music--we threaten to lose the heart and soul of the song, its simple power. Credit Hudson, though, for keeping us grounded.<br /><br />I liked "Dreamgirls" a lot. Obviously it sounds great, but all the production values are topnotch. But for all that is good, we have lost some of the intimacy of the stage show. There are a number of moments that might have been scaled back. By showing restraint in the orchestrations and film technique--the voices, the lyrics and the acting could have more effectively conveyed genuine emotion--raw and powerful as the show should be. Bonus points for Loretta Devine (Broadway's Deena) popping up to sing a nightclub number near the end. Definitely recommended! KGHarris, 12/06.</p></body></html>

Peter Sellers plays a tour de force triumverate: as abashed President Merkin Muffley, stiff upper lip Group Captain Lionel Mandrake and the mad wild Dr Strangelove. He displays the full range of his comic talent. The plot, turns into a slick, Catch 22 style satire on the bad zaniness of war and human motivation and races in increasingly powerful circles towards the conclusion. There are multiple brilliant comic set pieces to be savoured over and over.<br /><br />Highly recommended as satire of the highest order on the paranoid 1960s. And with the declaration a few years ago by a Commander in the Indian Army that they could afford a complete exchange of nuclear weapons with Pakistan at an estimated loss of only 16 million people, the logic of Strangelove may hang over us a while longer.</p></body></html>

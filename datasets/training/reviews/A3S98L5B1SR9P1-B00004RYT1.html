<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Horror Film!"></head><body><p>Psycho is the ultimate horror movie. It allows viewers to use their imaginations. Our imaginations will make the killings a lot worse, than if Alfred Hitchcock were to show us what happened. With awesome camera angles that add to the horrific effect and draw us in, Psycho hits the top 100 list with a bang. If you liked the plot of obsession, sex, and violence in Hitchcock's second greatest film, I must recommend everyone see Hitchcock's GREATEST film of all time: VERTIGO.

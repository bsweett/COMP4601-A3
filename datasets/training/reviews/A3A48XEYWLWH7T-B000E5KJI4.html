Without the spectre of Peter Jackson looming behind it, Troy would have been a lot more impressive.  Still, for its bright sandy sweep it is an enjoyable romp if one overlooks the departures from Homer's Iliad, particularly the time compression from 10 years to a week or so, and just enjoy the ride.  For those of us who have actually read the epic, there are well detailed `Hollywoodisms' that tend to detract more than Jackson's artistic license w/ Tolkien.  I was however pleased with the tragic hero treatment of Hektor, and thought Bana did a fine job.  The CG army clashes were frankly, paltry, compared to the ferocity of Helms Deep and Minis Tirith battles, but it was nice to have a lighter palette of the desert.  The cast did a good job, even if Brian Cox as Agamemnon was a somewhat unconvincing warrior leading his armies, he chewed scenes in the more personal dialogues.  I'm sure kids will clamor for this when they're assigned the Iliad in school, but bear in mind the differences and do take the time at least someday to read the first and arguably greatest epic story in Western civilization.</p></body></html>

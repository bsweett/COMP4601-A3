<meta name="summary" content="Cool, cult, horrific, grotesque fall out"></head><body><p>Other films explore drugs but this one goes further. The plot is pretty simple. Right at the start the characters are set up for respective gruesome, nightmarish cataclismic fall outs from drug addiction. The last twenty minutes in particular present a spiraling, multi-angled view of a sort of drugs hell- the veins, the needles, the pulsating arteries the physical transformations - beauty becomes gnarled, warped and frail. It makes for compulsive viewing.<br /><br />This is a movie dealing with extremes. Extreme loneliness, extreme desperation, extreme desire for acceptance, extreme addiction and extreme imagery. This is what makes it a cult tour de force along the lines of Trainspotting and Clockwork Orange (although I wouldn't quite elevate it to that league as the characters in this movie are not developed as fully as they could be). If such movies offend you, for christ sakes don't put yourself through the self inflicted torture of watching it. Remember the Director's Cut is even more gut wrenching than the original.</p></body></html>

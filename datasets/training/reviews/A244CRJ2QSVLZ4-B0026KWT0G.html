<meta name="summary" content="Jason, Why Did You Have To Kill Poor Shelly And Take His Hockey Mask?"></head><body><p>My "Friday the 13th" marathon that began on Friday, June 13, 2008, continues with the next installment, "Friday the 13th Part 3."  And Jason returns to slaughter more beautiful, unsuspecting young people who have ventured into his woods.<br /><br />  "Friday the 13th Part 3" is very different from the first two.  I envy those who saw it in 3D and wish it would be re-released at the theatres in 3D.  Perhaps 4D and this time we can smell the fear of the victims.<br /><br />  This film is also presented in a much wider aspect than the previous ones, 2.35:1 versus the standard 1.85:1.  I believe I prefer the wider aspect.<br /><br />  The characterization is much better than the previous ones.  There is Chris who must've been attacked by Jason and survived.  She still suffers from paranoia because of the incident and imagines that someone is watching them.  The best character, and the most three dimensional of them all, is Shelly who likes to play dangerous practical jokes in order to get attention.  We all can sympathize with his character.  At one time or another, we've pulled stunts in order to gain popularity, only to regret it later.  Unfortunately, Shelly never seems to learn that people like him for himself.<br /><br />  I believe that I've always been afraid of hockey and hockey masks.  They make the players look so ferocious and evil.  And the ice skates they wear have blades that can slice your hands and face if they come in contact with them.  Shelly must've found hockey masks scary.  Why else would he be wearing one when he performs his last stunt to scare someone?  Jason also must've thought it would be cool to wear a hockey mask when he killed people.  Maybe that is why he killed poor Shelly and took it from him.  From then on, he wore it throughout the rest of his stalking career.  His competition, Michael Myers of "Halloween," had a cool mask; perhaps Jason felt that he needed one as well.<br /><br />  Great characterization and some gruesome, unique killings give "Friday the 13th Part 3" four stars.  Best scene is when the muscular gymnast walking on his hands is sliced in half by Jason's machete.  What a gruesome way to die!<br /><br />  "Friday the 13 Part 3" is a must have for fans of the slasher genre.  In fact, the first four in the series are the best to own since they have a great story to tell of how Jason Voorhees became part of horror legend.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="decent war fantasy war movie but....."></head><body><p>When I saw this movie I was hoping for a group of men who did a exciting mission  to inflitrate the Nazi's in France in other words a decent commando movie.  Instead this was more of a fantasy in which all the top Nazi's get killed off in a movie theater.  And we really didn't get to see a fast moving story like 'where eagles dare' or even 'the dirty dozen" among the many other movies.  Ok , the top Nazi's deserved to die in theater blown to bits. They were complete monsters but it's not even close to what really happened in history.  So this movie becomes a revenge fantasy movie , which if it had a suspenseful buildup would have been easier for me to digest.  However I am biased in that I have a degree in history and believe that at a least a basic framework should be followed when making some movies.  I love Quentin Tarantinos work including the underrated "jackie brown" but this one just was flat for me. And that has nothing to do with history. It wasn't like we saw them go behind the lines against the odds and carry out any mission. Instead we see a psychotic slaughter of German soldiers with nothing leading up to it much.<br />These were even really bad germans either.  This was a major A movie so on that scale I would have to give it a 3 star rating in my book.  The blu ray looks great though and it's the only way to go if you want to own this movie.</p></body></html>

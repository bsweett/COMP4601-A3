<meta name="summary" content="2-Disc Special Edition Loaded with Fun and Informative Extras!"></head><body><p>The first disc starts off with "The Return of a Legend." With the final shot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Special Edition)</a>, Steven Spielberg assumed that he was done with Indiana Jones but five years ago fans started asking about another film. It was Harrison Ford who expressed an interest in revisiting the character and kept after George Lucas and Spielberg. This featurette takes a look at how this new film came together.<br /><br />"Pre-Production" examines the preparation and planning that went into the project. Spielberg wanted to maintain the same look as the previous films. We see Ford getting outfitted with his iconic gear while Shia LeBeouf says that Spielberg gave him three films from the 1950s to study in order to get a handle on the time period that the film takes place.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with the impressive "Production Diary: Making Kingdom of the Crystal Skull." It is broken down into six featurettes or can be viewed all together for a feature-length look at principal photography: from the first day to the final one. For Spielberg it felt like no time had passed between films. This is a detailed look at shooting in key locations of the film: New Mexico, Connecticut, Hawaii, and four soundstages in Los Angeles. There is plenty of on-location/on the set footage as we see Spielberg and co. at work.<br /><br />"Warrior Makeup" takes a look at the make-up job done on the warriors that guard the temple that houses the Crystal Skulls.<br /><br />"The Crystal Skulls" examines the legend behind them and the mystery of how they were made. Stan Winston and his team created the props for the film and we see how they were constructed.<br /><br />"Iconic Props" takes a look at some of the gear used in the film - who uses it, when its used, and its source.<br /><br />"The Effects of Indy" examines the digital photography and matte paintings done in the film. We see the scenes that were enhanced by CGI and how the final product was achieved.<br /><br />"Adventures in Post-Production" takes a look at editing phase. Spielberg shot and edited on film, the latter of which is rare nowadays. Editor Michael Kahn talk about the challenge of working on this film while Ben Burtt shows how he created some of the sounds used in the film.<br /><br />"Closing: Team Indy" is a brief montage that pays tribute to the cast and crew of the film.<br /><br />"Pre-Visualization Sequences" features the rough, CGI footage for three seqeunces from the film that gave the filmmakers an early look at what they would look like.<br /><br />Also included are five galleries of artwork, production stills and behind-the-scenes photographs.<br /><br />Finally, there are three trailers.</p></body></html>

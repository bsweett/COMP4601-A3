<meta name="summary" content="The Triumph Of Style Over Substance"></head><body><p>When the tv show Miami Vice first became popular, a colleague described it to me as the "triumph of style over substance." What he meant was that the window dressing - clothes, cars, music, setting - was more important than the stories.<br /><br />Today this phenomenon is so familiar that we frequently confuse veneer with content, especially in cases where there is no content - read Paris Hilton among others. In Sin City you find the full flower of this evolution.<br /><br />Rodriguez has taken the two-dimensional comic images of Frank Miller, (in combination with the one-dimensional characters and plots), and succeeded in making them even more two-dimensional. The film is visually mesmerizing, a spellbinding combination of heavily made-up actors, digital backgrounds, and high-tech special effects. It has the flatness of a comic, and like a comic, it is impenetrable.<br /><br />So compelling is the visual style achieved here that you quickly forget that the plots are moronic, the characters both ludicrous and repulsive, the reliance on exhausted stereotypes pitiful, and the entire vibe simultaneously decadent and corrupt on one hand, on the other self-satisfied and smug.<br /><br />Sin City is a place where everyone is guilty, every day is dark, and every problem is solved through violence. Rodriguez and Tarantino are still the two bad 12-year olds who must be separated because they are disruptive to the rest of the class.<br /><br />If you want to see another example of what happens when these two miscreants collaborate, check out From Dusk Till Dawn, a film which certainly has earned a place on any Worst Movies Of All Time list.</p></body></html>

But, occasionally, even manly men are cowed by their better halves. So one day I was "convinced" to sit down and watch this film. And, because even manly men can channel their more refined dimensions (and without forfeiting their man card), I ended up digging MAMMA MIA and, dammit, even humming some of these Abba songs!<br /><br />The set-up goes like this: It's just before Sophie's wedding, and preparations are lively. But there's just one thing missing to make it all perfect: her father to give her away. All her life, Sophie had gone on, not knowing who her dad is. But then she stumbles upon her mother Donna's diary and discovers that her dad could be one of three possible men. All with whom, the diary states, her mother had spent time, with one thing leading to another, and dot dot dot... Unbeknownst to Donna, Sophie invites all three men to her wedding. And, then, fun shenanigans.<br /><br />For those who've signed up for FeelGoodology 101, know that the first thing the professor does in class is pop in this DVD. Say what you will about MAMMA MIA, kibitz about the campy elements or grouse that some or most of the cast can't carry a tune, but that doesn't alter the fact that this musical simply makes you feel good. I've never seen Meryl Streep in a role like this, which just goes to show that the woman can officially do anything in the acting gig. Pierce Brosnan, no, he can't sing, but so what? He, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard come in with good humor and grace. Amanda Seyfried as Sophie is so damn engaging and so hopefully wistful that she's the perfect choice to open the movie with, because her plight immediately draws you into the story. And she can sing. Her vibrant rendition of "Honey Honey" is an exercise in exuberance and catchiness. It may be my favorite song, up there with "Chiqitita," "Take a Chance on Me" and "Dancing Queen," this last one to which I, thankfully, managed to abstain from humming along (for I am a manly man and not some disco dude).<br /><br />There's not much here that's rooted in reality, and it's fine. Every now and then, this type of film is exactly what I'm looking for, especially when one's down in the dumps. MAMMA MIA is a fable, full of warmth and great energy and vivid colors. It's set on a stunning Greek island and boasts its very own spirited Greek chorus, which does just fine going into backup singers mode. You get the happy ending that was never in doubt. And, instead of one Prince Charming, the movie presents three.<br /><br />What I've got is the single disc DVD. Its special features include lukewarm audio commentary by Director Phyllida Lloyd (who also directed the stage productions of MAMMA MIA) and the deleted musical number "The Name of the Game." And, ooooh, there's an option to play the movie with on-screen lyrics for the musical numbers! And an option to skip right to a song. Score, baby!<br /><br />Okay. And now I'm gonna watch some football (please don't take away my man card).</p></body></html>

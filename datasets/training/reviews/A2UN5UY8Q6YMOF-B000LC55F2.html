This is the movie that got me to buy a Blu-Ray player after owning an HD DVD player since its launch last April.  This is an entertaining movie with lots of plot twists, mystery, and intrigue.  Couple that with an all-star cast including Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Scarlett Johansson and you have the ingredients for a great movie.  Hugh surprisingly holds his own and the movie kept my interest.  The movie falls back on some supernatural silliness at the end, which is the only low point of the movie.  As much as I liked this one, I liked The Illusionist a bit better.  The Blu-Ray picture quality was OK, but the movie is mostly dim indoor scenes, which do not show as dramatic an improvement over DVD as bright outdoor scenes.</p></body></html>

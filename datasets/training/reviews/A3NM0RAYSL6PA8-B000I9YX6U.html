<meta name="summary" content="Solid performance by Robin Williams; first rate ..."></head><body><p>cinematography.  Compelling direction.  The only problem for me was that it didn't hold up as well on multiple viewings.  Still, it is a movie that is very much worth seeing.<p>I'd heard good word about One Hour Photo, but went into it knowing little beyond the observation that Robin Williams' character was creepy. That didn't surprise me. I've always felt that, beneath the machine-gun style joke slinging, there is something, well, pathological about Mr. Williams. No, I don't think he is a psychopath like his character in this movie. However, let's just say that I always felt that being creepy was part of his less well advertised repertoir. (Come on. Patch Adams was creepy. Admit it.)<p>Let me cut to the chase. This movie is about the writing; about the directing; about the cinematography; and, mostly, about a stunning, understated performance by Williams. There are some flaws here. The actors who play the suburban family on whom Williams' character obsesses turn in relatively weak performances; but, fortunately, their roles are small. Williams so dominates the screen, and does his work so well, that it isn't a distraction that the rest of the world he inhabits seems a bit two dimensional (much like all those photographs in which he lives). I should note that the actor who plays his boss at the SavMart turns in a solid performance, as well. This is critical since Williams' fate at the SavMart, at the hands of this boss, is the core, and entirely credible, linchpin around which this psychological thriller revolves.<p>The music and sound effects are generally used well, although they are a bit heavy handed at times. And the interesting shots and colors are reminiscent of artistic photography--adding a magnificent texture and appeal to the film.<p>This film is creepy, and it sits with you. It's a tribute to good film-making, great writing, and Robin Williams.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Realistic take on both boxing and Depression-era big city life"></head><body><p>It's difficult to pick the most impressive element of "Cinderella Man."  Is it the gritty truth of the boxing scenes, which are some of the best ever done?  Or does the movie's strength lie in its authentic recreation of Depression-era New Jersey and New York City?  Or is it the ensemble of great talent (Russell Crowe in the title role of James Braddock, Rene Zellweger as his loving, tough wife Mae, or Paul Giamatti as Braddock's manager, the lovable schlub Joe Gould)?<br /><br />Well, fortunately we really don't have to choose what we like most about "Cinderalla Man," but suffice it to say that we like it a lot.  Ron Howard reunited with Crowe after their smash hit "A Beautiful Mind," and it's plain to see that these two bring out the best in each other.<br /><br />James Braddock, the "Bulldog of Bergen," opens the film as a contender for the light-heavyweight title.  In a single bout in 1928, Braddock earns over $8,000, after paying all his expenses.  This, at a time when, as Braddock will soon learn, it costs forty four dollars to turn the electricity back on after you're three months behind.  We first see Braddock chiseled, cocky, and dominant.<br /><br />My, how things change!  In the span of a few months, the nation is tanking, and Braddock isn't doing much better.  Rather than spoiled by the fruits of victory (he didn't start drinking or whoring around), Braddock just got injured.  This is not a compassionate era for America - when Braddock breaks his right hand in a bout and still keeps fighting, the boxing authorities not only revoke his license, they also refuse to pay him the $50 he was promised for the fight because he didn't put on a good show.<br /><br />Reduced to begging for shifts down at "the docks," Braddock barely keeps his family together -- with a lot of help from his bedrock Mae -- but he is soon forced to go on public assistance.  This is correctly evoked as a shameful act . . . this was a time in America when being on the public "dole" was one of the worst things that could happen to a proud man.  Crowe nails his depiction of a man armed only with his decency, now that his boxing has been taken away.<br /><br />But, as one can expect, a lifeline gets tossed to Braddock as Gould wheedles the boxing authorities to give Braddock another fight.  His license isn't restored - the boxing world needs a punching bag to replace a last-minute cancellation against a hot up-and-comer, and Braddock was known to be desperate.  This bout starts Braddock's long march to rememption, culminating with a title fight against the monster Max Baer, who had killed two men in the ring.<br /><br />Based on a true story, "Cinderalla Man" strives for greatness and almost makes it.  The story loses focus a couple of times, with hints at Braddock being the stand-in for the downtrodden of New York and New Jersey, and also a bit about the rise of the labor movement.  It's clear that this movie was supposed to be a "great sports film" in the pantheon of "Million Dollar Baby" and "Bull Durham," and it's not that.  "Cinderlla Man" goes into the pantheon of excellent feel-good sports movies, like "Rudy," "Seabiscuit," and "Legend," that are darn fine entertainment and worthy of our attention.

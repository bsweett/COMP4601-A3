A coalition of power-hungry men is contriving to start a war between the two superpowers, in order to gain world domination.  Affleck figures this out while the entire US government seems totally puzzled as to why attacks are suddenly occuring on strategic US locations.  The movie is slick and the action is non-stop, but the premise of a young PhD. who has written a paper about the new Russian president and thus knows his every motivation is a little hard to swallow.</p></body></html>

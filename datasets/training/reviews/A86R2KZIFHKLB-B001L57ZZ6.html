<meta name="summary" content="Computers take things literally"></head><body><p>What we have is a good suspension of everyday belief. Action galore, explosions, car wrecks, fast chases, excape, black-mail, Govt' secrets, and a computer that can think about the literalness of a word. The govt' computer "Eagle Eye" is set to kill the President and his Cabinet, by black-mailing two citizens to do the physical work and wothout knowing their real purpose to assassinate the president. Do we feel a Skynet moment here? Only on a smaller scale. We dont go to the movies for realism, we go for entertainment, and that what this movie does...entertain.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A PRAIRIE HOME RIOT"></head><body><p>Intimate and loving theatrical version of the folksy and slightly radical Garrison Keillor radio program, A Prairie Home Companion, a weekly National Public Radio show, broadcast from the fictitious, rural prarie town of Lake Wobegon, Minnesota, "where all the women are pretty, all the men strong, and all the children above average.". If you've never tuned in, picture a folk music version of a Grand Ole Opry broadcast with sharp mid-western humor and accomplished and modest folk music, without money and celebrities.<br /><br />It would seem you may need to be a fan of the program to appreciate director Robert Altman's probing and low-key treatment of Keillor's script, in which the story of the radio show's last broadcast is merely a backdrop to the gentle rhythms and interactions of it's participants. Kevin Kline brings Keillor's Bogart-like film noir detective, Guy Noir, to  an enormous life-like comedic characterization, and Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly, as a pair of guitar strumming ranch hands, with a hysterically funny musical repertoire, are such a warm embrace of dusty saddle busters, it's like a cloud of mid-western dirt trails blows in with them every time they enter a scene.<br /><br />It doesn't all work so gracefully, it's meandering and inconsequential narrative at times seems less significant, and less smugly aloof, than any episode of the radio series, giving it the cinematic right to take itself more seriously. Guy Noir's 'lady in the white trenchcoat' becomes a literal angel who arrives to guide someone to heaven. Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin, as what is left of a once regionally renowned singing family, although a welcome sight, get somewhat lost in Altman's typical ad-lib and overlapping dialogue, the enormity of their celebrity status projection overwhelms the smallness of their roles.<br /><br />But anyone from Lake Wobegon would tell me to mind my manners and quit knit-picking. It's a real treat for fans of the radio show. And anyone else can surely appreciate a good dirty joke, delivered joyfully with a devil's grin by Harrelson and Reilly.</p></body></html>

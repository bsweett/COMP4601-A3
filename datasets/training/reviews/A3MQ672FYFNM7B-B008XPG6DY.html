<meta name="summary" content="enjoy the ride with Clive Owen"></head><body><p>Clive plays Charles Schine, a harried Chicago suburbanite that meets a sultry passenger on the train, Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston.) Soon, Charles is caught up in a frightening game of cat and mouse between the movie's resident bad-guy, LaRoche (Vincent Cassel.)<br /><br />"Derailed" is the movie that truly turned me on to the talent of Mr. Clive Owen. In my humble opinion, Clive Owen is the best actor of his generation because he is thought-provoking and not afraid to get his hands dirty so to speak because he gladly plays multi-faceted roles. Clive reminds me of a young Clark Gable.<br /><br />I have never been crazy about Jennifer Aniston (am I the only person that has never seen "Friends"?) Because she's never done anything that I liked; although I was able to sit through "The Object of My Affection." Jennifer Aniston is the perfect example of one of today's "stars" that coast by and do as little as possible but are able to rise right to the top. In any event, after I saw this movie I had a new fondness for her.<br /><br />The movie has some very fascinating twists and turns, up to the very end. This is one of those movies that will give you chills. So sit back, and enjoy the ride with Clive Owen.</p></body></html>

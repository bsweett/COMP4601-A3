<meta name="summary" content="LINCOLN'S RUN"></head><body><p>Mixed reviews are always interesting to read and the reasons why over a film like this...Make no mistake, while the topic of cloning is a seriously thought provoking subject matter (moral,ethical,medical issues,etc.)the viewer must not forget The Island is sheer entertainment ! Obvious visual and partial story line ingredients echo sci-fi films of the past such as Logan's Run,Blade Runner,THX-1138,Fifth Element----the list can go on forever.Think of what director Michael Bay has done is an homage to those films and not an easy rip off! Also, The Island manages to really hit close to home in that cloning technology in the 21st century isn't sci fi fodder any more, but fact.Could something like this really happen with clones? Is it happening already? Who knows...<br /><br />Ewan McGregor portrays Lincoln who begins to question his existence and why things are the way they are in his clean-room environment society; This in great part is fueled by repetitive and haunting cryptic dreams that he cannot shake.Are they just dreams, memories, premonitions or all of the above? Are they his or someone else's? Are memory implants transferrable and possible? One can begin to see the underlying theme here about human existence and mortality that permeated and resonated strongly in 1982's sci-fi cult classic Blade Runner (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?). Lincoln also suspects something is amiss and wants answers about The Island; A beautiful piece of remaining inhabitable paradise left untouched as an untainted remnant of the "contamination" war.Those fortunate enough to win the lottery get to leave their hermetically sealed world and live the remainder of their lives on Fantasy Island...or do they ?...Lincoln soon unravels the mystery of the Island. Under dire circumstances he escapes his underground hi-tech world with the lovely and intelligent Jordan played by Scarlett Johansson. Just watching the underground city escape sequences through the labyrinth of obstacles, tunnels and secret corridors brings back my own memories of watching Logan's Run in 1976 for the first time when Logan is also escaping the city with another runner named Jessica...Through Lincoln's own investigating he discovers the true horrors that await all residents of The Island...<br /><br />McGregor never disappoints as an actor and over the years has established himself pretty well. He may not have the box office draw or pull of Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, or even Tom Hanks, but his performances always come through with great believability and ease.He's not good at his craft;he's great at it ! Roles he has chosen are always likeable and easy for most audiences to connect with. Majority of roles he chooses compare to those  trustworthy friends we have and can easily hang out with with no pretentious airs.There's an honesty to his portrayal of characters (the guy you would want to back you up in a bar brawl). McGregor connects with the average Joe. Thus, his character wants answers that most of us want about our "existence" and place in the universe;All the why's and how's.<br /><br />Steve Buscemi,ever since I saw him years ago in Reservoir Dogs, always garners a film with his unique acting talent.Regardless if he is cast in an Oscar contender of a film or the bomb of the year,  Buscemi always adds that "lift" or comical nuance that is unmistakebly his style and angle!<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson as Jordan is a hot beauty that delivers as well. The chemistry between McGregor and Johansson works smoothly.Scarlett is destined to become even a bigger star as more roles come in and time goes by. She definitely has that "it" factor and a magnetic presence that indicates she's an actress and not just a cover girl hottie ! Her dialogue and character's emotional range may have seemed limited, but what was evident was absolutely tangible.<br /><br />Give The Island a visit for the acting, story, and I almost forgot to mention, it's super sci-fi high octane special effects.Don't just judge it by saying ,"Oh, another sci-fi geek film".Plenty of product plug ins as well that should make both Chrysler and Cadillac proud in showing off their hot current production autos and concept vehicles used as vintage and police cars in this film;20 years ago the movie RoboCop did the same for Ford by using the then somewhat "futuristic" and  stylish Taurus car(by 1980's standards that is)... Gotta love all the cars, toys and gadgets in this film !It's a pretty thrilling and captivating flick with amazingly slick and polished chase sequences and pyrotechnics !</p></body></html>

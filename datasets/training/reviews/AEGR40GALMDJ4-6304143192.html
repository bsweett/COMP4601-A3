After the movie, it shocks you that you found heart and compassion from something that looks like a mud sculpture.  E.T. also has some of the greatest performances from child actors than in any other movie.  In this film, we see little Drew Barrymore making a stellar breakout performance as the little sister of Elliot in the film.  The new 20th Anniversary of E.T. special edition definately is better than the original cut.  The effects sparkle like never before.  The DVD is a wonderful thing to add to anyone's DVD collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Edition)"></head><body><p>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Edition) being an updated version of the 1971 movie with Gene Wilder and stars Johnny Depp in the role as Willy Wonka. The special effects are ofcourse better and the sound is also better. However, the story line differs from the book in many ways as the 1971 version with Wilder does not. The musical numbers of the ompa lompas are also better in the 1971 movie. I love watching the Gene Wilder movie and watch it any time it shows on television. This movie I am not so sure if I have same affection towards. I wish I could give it 2.5/5 but since I can not then I give it a weak 3. 3/5.</p></body></html>

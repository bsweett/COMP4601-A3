<meta name="summary" content="Talented Jennifer Garner Is Wasted.  Period."></head><body><p>I'm not a big comic book fan, but I was really looking forward to seeing Jennifer Garner in 'Elektra.'  Spin-off or not, it doesn't matter, for if you have seen 'Alias' series, you know Ms. Garner has star quality, and that she can not only act, but do great action stunts herself.<br /><br />But ... oh dear, what happened?  Though Jennifer Garner's Elektra in sexy tight red costume is brought to life (thanks to her sensei Terence Stamp), the actions are not exciting as they should be, so-so at best, and the script is simply awful.  Tedious flashbacks showing Elektra's trauma as little girl?  Ninja-like villains whose mannerism is based psuedo-Japanese culture, and masterminds played by typecast Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Will Yun Lee?  I thought ninja characters are dead in Hollywood back in the 80s.<br /><br />Besides the lifeless characters surrounding Elektra, the martial arts action scenes are heavily cut and edited, so all you see in action parts is a series of short bits (like 2-5 seconds), or creepy animals created with CGIs.  It's the worst type of editing, too fast, too MTV-like.<br /><br />I find the unique team of the assassins -- Stone, Tattoo, Kinkou, Typhoid -- are very interesting (more so than Goran Visnjic and his daughter), and surely they could have provided exciting fight scenes, if pitted against Elektra effectively.  Well, they fight each other, Elektra and killers, but the fact is Rob Bowman fails to make good use of the assassins' abilities, and they vanish from the screen too quickly.  The only original thing about thrie fight is the deadly kiss -- of Elektra and Typhoid -- a sort of guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Maybe there is a director's cut somewhere in the vault of the studio.  If so, we want to see it right now, for the present film desperately needs less talks and more actions, and better editing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Magnolia  (1999)"></head><body><p>Director:  P.T. Anderson<br /><br />Cast:  Jeremy Blackman, Tom Cruise, Phillip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Jason Robards Jr., Melora Walters.<br /><br />Running Time:  188 minutes.<br /><br />Rated R for strong language, drug use, simulated sex, and brief violence.<br /><br />An incredible spectacle of a film, opening with the notion that there are no coincidences and that events transpire not by chance, but for a purpose and closes after over three hours with a brilliant underlying message paved by symbolism.  Unfortunately for P.T. Anderson's epic one-day dissertation into the lives of a dozen individuals living in the Fernando Valley, "Magnolia" is just too long and not quite enthralling or beguiling enough to sustain absolute interest.  Tom Cruise (who won the 1999 Golden Globe Award for his supporting performance and got snubbed of an Oscar) steals the show as male-chauvinist eccentric celebrity Frank T.J. Mackey, who promotes his theories about how to acquire sex from beautiful women.<br /><br />Rich TV tycoon Earl Partridge (Jason Robards Jr.) lies on his deathbed with his estranged, drugged up wife (in a brilliant role by Julianne Moore) and sincere male nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman) by his side.  Desperately wanting to get in touch with his long lost son (who just so happens to be Mackey), Partridge awaits his demise with despair and lament.  Phillip Baker Hall stars as the popular What Do Kids Know? game-show host Jimmy Gator, who is desperately in search of reconciliation with his druggie daughter Claudia Gator (played beautifully by Melora Walters) due to his sudden diagnosis of cancer.  John C. Reilly is exceptional as the soft, yet stern police officer who wants nothing more than to find someone to grow old with and stumbles upon the misguided Claudia along his daily cop route.  As Gator attempts to continue the game-show despite his condition, the audience learns of two outrageously intelligent child products:  Stanley (Blackman) and Donnie Smith (William H. Macy in a consistently solid performance).  Stanley is the heir-apparent to whiz kid Donnie Smith, who is now a superstar afterthought, left behind by his parents and his boss.<br /><br />Director P.T. Anderson manages to juggle all of these characters very well throughout the film, intertwining the plot points with ease and sincerity.  Along with spectacular performances from Cruise, Moore, and Reilly, "Magnolia" possesses two incredibly memorable moments:  1) the unison sing-along to Aimee Mann's "Wise Up" is superbly hilarious and melancholy all-in-one, sending reverberates of spine-tingles of hope and gloom in harmony and 2) the most unforgettable scene of precipitation in cinema history (it makes The Birds look like child's play).  A genuine effort to show the desolation that engulfs when expectations are not met and mistakes are made, "Magnolia cultivates into a film that glorifies the courage, calamity, and love that transpires throughout life.  While certainly not perfect, this film is unique and complex enough to hold its own, but ultimately does not possess enough unified direction and cohesion to keep the restless viewer involved.  A great idea, a grand ensemble cast, and an amazing musical contribution from Aimee Mann; however, only adequate execution.  A very good film, just no "American Beauty".</p></body></html>

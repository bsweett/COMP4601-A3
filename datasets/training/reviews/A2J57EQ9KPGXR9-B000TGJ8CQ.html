<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie Marred by the 9/11 Scare Tactics"></head><body><p>Next, a movie based on the Philip K. Dick short story,  is very clever in spots. Nicholas Cage plays a precognative gmbler/magician who can see two minutes into the future. The interesting thing in this movie is that he can see all possible futures; this led to some interesting scenes in the movie. The plot revolves around terrorists planning to blow up LA who finad out that this guy could upset their master plan. Government agents are looking for this guy too for the same reason. Ahh, terrorism, the all purpose plot device - why blow up LA? Just because I guess - whatever..<br /><br />  Anyway, the special effects are cool, there are some good action sequences and Cage is a good choice to play the main character in the movie. Its not worth the 9-10 bucks it would have taken to see this in the theatres but it is worth renting/buying on sale.</p></body></html>

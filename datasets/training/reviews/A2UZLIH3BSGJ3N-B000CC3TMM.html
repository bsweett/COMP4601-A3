<meta name="summary" content="A silly movie"></head><body><p>I just recently watched Transporter 2,and it was everything I was expecting it to be.Aside from it's silly plot,it is a fun movie to watch.It has(like the original)spectacular,coreographed fight scenes,and the stunts...well,lets just say that are pretty amazing,but at the same time are unbelieveable.Stuff that only can be created for film and in cartoons.I am a Jason Stratham fan,I've watched all his movies(great&terrible) since his first film.This is a fun film,but not much more than that.There are allot of inconsistencies with the action,but hey...that's why its just a movie.Some of the FX bloopers are him being able to sheild himself from a hail of bullits with a wooden door,while in a scene directly after,the phsyco blond wastes some Miami cops and blasts holes through the cop car.Kinda funny if you ask me.This is a film I wouldn't buy,but well worth renting.If you want to see Stratham in some excelent films,see his first:Lock,Stock and two Smoking Barrels as well as Snatch.The original Transporter is about the same level as the sequel,but with a smaller budget.Hokey to a fault storywise,but a fun ride all the way.</p></body></html>

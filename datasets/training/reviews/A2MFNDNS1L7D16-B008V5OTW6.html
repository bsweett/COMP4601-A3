<meta name="summary" content="We've killed a terrorist ...mazel-tov. My just  wife just had a"></head><body><p>baby daughter...mazel-tov. We've killed another  terrorist...mazel-tov. So it goes. On the surface it's all so simple. The 11 Israeli atheletes to the Munich Olympics in 1972 were murdered by Black September. Israel will seek out & kill individuals who knew or were responsible. They have a list of leaders. The  Massad recruits agent Avner played by Eric Bana & a team of specialist to find them. There are rules. The Massad & Prime Minister Golda Meir, who is sitting right there, must have credible deniability. The team is stripped of their identity. They are not well known, anyway. The must do the killing only in Europe & must not kill any innocent bystanders. Expolsions are the preferred method of assassination. They seem to have  unlimited funds from $$$ stashed in Swiss safety deposit boxes. They are sucessful but not as they planned. They must kill point blank with guns. They travel unauthorized to Lebanon & many innocents are killed. They make a side trip to Amsterdam simply to kill a female assassin very graphically in cold blood for killing a team member. She had come on first to Avner who thought of his sweet wife & turned down a vist to her room. So it becomes apparent while he is seeking out & killing terrorist he is in turn being hunted also. He fears for his family & has them moved to from Israel to Brooklyn. It is very hard to believe in the beginning, that Avnar is a stone cold agent. He is a handsome, young, modest family man that any mother (except his own) could love. But Speilberg hasn't made a mistake in the casting. The killing does take it toll, emotionally on Avnar. Speilberg hasn't drawn the terrorist as evil, villians deserving to be killed. They are somtimes gentle, urbane, respected family men. They are even likeable. They must die. Avnar quits & joins his family in Brooklyn. His sanity is in doubt.<br /><br />  In any case it doesn't matter. As soon as you kill a leader somone immediately rises to take their place. The more terrorist you kill, the more that sprout, like weeds. This is an above average thriller with little technical whiz bang. It has the additional virtue that some of it at least, is true.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well made remake"></head><body><p>With the thought that most remakes are terrible peices of trash that shouldn't of been made in the first place.  I was pleasantly surprised with this remake of "The Italian Job".  You get time to know a little about the character but doesn't hesitate to give the action and comedy quickly.  Good acting all around.  This movie is a good rental for the occasional watching.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A film with the right parts, but ends up being too staged"></head><body><p>The film does have a strong feel and Clooney gives a solid performance.  I found Pollack's lawyer especially sharply drawn and convincing.  In the end, the movie becomes another rehashing of The Insider.  The screenwriter tried to create the typical conflicted sub-plot of the protagonist's battle with his professional/moral obligations and his personal struggles, etc, however this was not highly nuanced.  Of course their was the divorced dad angle too for more contrived emotional push. The one liners that are stirring in the trailers turn out be banal in the context of the plot, which turns into a simple-minded rampage of a corporation hell-bent on eliminating all whistle-blowers.  As for the attorney who "sees the light", although strongly performed by Wilkinson, his self-revelation becomes cliched scene-by-scene.</p></body></html>

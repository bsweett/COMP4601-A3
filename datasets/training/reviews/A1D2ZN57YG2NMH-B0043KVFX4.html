<meta name="summary" content="The Resident Evil films are FAR From "Extinct""></head><body><p>From the start, this film had me completely surrendered to it's gripping narrative, fantastic cinematography and hugely entertaining action scenes. Unlike the first two films in the franchise, "Extinction" brings the next gen gore of the video games "Resident Evil 4 and 5" to the big screen. No more fast cuts, discreet angles or dark lenses... This is a hardcore, zombie killing action-fest. Aside from this new development, the characters are all written with much more attention to characterization and emotion. There are many scenes in the film where you find yourself GENUINELY caring what happens to the characters. On top of everything I've mentioned, the musical score by Charlie Clouser WAY outclasses the previous two scores and is both effective and well produced. If I had one negative thing to say about this film it's that it ended as soon as it did!</p></body></html>

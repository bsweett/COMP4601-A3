<meta name="summary" content="Into the Wild"></head><body><p>Based on a true story. After graduating from Emory University, top student and athlete Christopher McCandless abandoned his possessions, gave his entire $24,000 savings account to charity and hitchhiked to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters who shape his life. This movie is  beautiful, deep, true, adventurous, sad, occasionally funny, real, at times very touching. Chris McCandless lived a whole, remarkable, life. And Sean Penn has captured those two years for all to see in this movie.</p></body></html>

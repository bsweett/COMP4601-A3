<meta name="summary" content="Too Powerful to Deny"></head><body><p>I do not like films that take a sympathetic view to the lives of killers. Killers are not to be sympathized with. They are to be executed. The overall effectiveness of this film, however, is too powerful to deny. It was an amazing work of art. This film is so well done, so well thought out and written, that what is left is a portrait of a ruined human being caught in a downward spiral of horrible self-laceration. <p>The main character's unbreakable decent into evil is charted out like a map with only one road. There were actual scenes (particularly the &quot;job interview&quot; scenes) where I found this killer heartbreaking - just as heartbreaking as I found the killer's last victim (the great character actor, Scott Wilson) pleading for his life. <p>What can be said about Charlize Theron's performance that hasn't already been said? Nothing, really. Suffice to say, a well deserved Oscar. I have never seen an actor completely disappear into a role like this. Ever. Theron was all the way gone. I have never seen a more convincing job. <p>Definitely not a film to set a romantic mood with the girlfriend. But one I bet you won't forget any time soon. --Mykal Banta</p></body></html>

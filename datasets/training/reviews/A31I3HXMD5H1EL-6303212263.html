<meta name="summary" content="The Man of Steel Needs  a Tune-Up!"></head><body><p>This is not a knock of Superman, the Movie. Richard Donner's take on the the Man of Steel is a bit overlong, but is terrific, and features a wonderful cast, particularly young Christopher Reeve, who gives Superman a dignity not seen since George Reeves portrayed him, in the 1950s.<p>The  special effects are, for the most part, exceptional, particularly when you  consider that the digital technology we enjoy today was nonexistant in  1978. (It's for this very reason that George Lucas 'remade' Star Wars; we  can enjoy 'miracles' on screen today, thanks to the advancements of the  last few years.) The flying sequences have an airy poetry that had never  been seen in any live action 'Superman' prior to this film.<p>The problem  in S:TM lies in the quality of the master that the video transfers are  being made from. It has aged, and deteriorated considerably over the last  22 years. What compounds the problem is that the 'Krypton' sequence opening  the film was shot 'white on white', which shows the flaws and cracks on the  acetate master worse than any other color combination.<p>This is a  suggestion to Warner Bros...Create a remastered, cleaned-up original,  featuring the deleted scenes (which were aired when the movie was  'expanded' for its first television run), all the trailers, include the  'Making of' documentary, hosted by Reeves, that aired when the film was  first released, add in an audio track with commentary by Donner, Reeve, and  Hackman (getting Brando to participate is too much to hope for!), include  an 'audio only' track of John Williams' fabulous score. Those of us who love this film  (and there are a LOT of us!) would shell out the money for this truly  'special' presentation, and future generations would be able to see  'Superman' the way he was MEANT to be seen!</p></body></html>

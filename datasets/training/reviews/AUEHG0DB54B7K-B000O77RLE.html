Letters was budgeted at 20 million while Flags of Our Fathers had a 90 million budget.  Viewing both films gives us a full picture of a cataclysmic battle that from our perspective of sixty years seems a terrible waste of life.<br /><br />The film provides perspectives from that on an enlisted man (Saigo, a baker played by Kazunari Ninomiya) and General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (played by Ken Watanabe) through their actions on the island and flashbacks.  So, we learn that General Kuribayashi, a career soldier in the cavalry, lived for a time in the United States where he received as a gift a Colt revolver from his American hosts and that Saigo was drafted after his baking equipment was confiscated to be used in the war effort.  The film begins with the arrival of General Kuribayashi on Iwo Jima and chronicles the hard life of the defenders plagued with dysentery, poor rations and the heat.  Kuribayashi takes up what his officers feel is a poor defense of the island by digging tunnels and not creating trenches on the beach.  The one ally Kuribayashi has among his officers is Baron Nishi, a pragmatic man who had been in the equestrian events in the 1932 Olympics held in Los Angeles and makes his first appearance riding a horse.  There is a feeling of doom over the garrison as little by little they receive mounting bad new: the destruction of what remains of the Japanese fleet, that no additional tanks can be sent and that no reinforcements can be expected.<br /><br />Kuribayashi maintains a positive front that the battle can be won but everyone in the Japanese garrison can sense immanent defeat. As with Flags of Our Fathers, the battle scenes where filmed showing the ferocity of the fighting and the suicides of many of the Japanese soldiers.  There is a scene where a Japanese commander ignores the order of Kuribayashi to withdraw and orders his men, one of whom is Saigo, to commit suicide, which they do with hand grenades (tying in to a scene from Fathers).  Several of the soldiers are clearly reluctant to kill themselves but only Saigo and another soldier are left alive.<br /><br />In a film filled with memorable performances two stand out. Ken Watanabe gives a magnificent performance as General Kuribayashi given him a heroic but vulnerable character as he draws sketches of happier past events.  At one point, it appears that the waste of lives almost convinces him that he should surrender but then a broadcast from his home town if Japan by a group of children imploring him to defend them changes his mind.  Kazunari Ninomiya as Saigo is excellent as a reluctant soldier who is doing his duty but would rather surrender that be killed or commit suicide.  Kuribayashi and Saigo are at opposite ends; one heroic and the other pragmatic but the two interact several times in the film and Kuribayashi is instrumental in saving Saigo.<br /><br />The film is beautifully photographed using mono-chromatic colors that give it a feel of old photographs.  Like Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jim tells an unvarnished story about the horrors of war; the difference with Letters is that the cause is lost and the heroism is tinged with desperation.  I highly recommend seeing both Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima.  Together they present an unforgettable story of a battle that marked the beginning of the end of the war in the Pacific.</p></body></html>

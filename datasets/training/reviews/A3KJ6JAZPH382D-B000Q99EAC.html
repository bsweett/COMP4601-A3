<meta name="summary" content="Saving Rocky"></head><body><p>Sylvester Stallone is feeling nostalgic lately. Between "Rocky Balboa" and the latest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XHP2C">Rambo</a> installment, he's trying to resurrect past glories and reconfirm that his skills as a writer/director/actor are worth recalling as solid. "Rocky Balboa" goes a long way towards re-establishing Stallone's credibility for the better.<br /><br />"Rocky Balboa" is a well done, feel good sixth chapter, redeeming the sometimes absurdity of the later <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GAOGS">Rocky</a> films. Rocky is an older man, he's lost his Adriane but named his restaurant after her, has a son who hates living in a shadow. (Weird irony - years ago when Weird Al did a Rocky parody song to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICM5IK">Eye of The Tiger,</a> he sang about Rocky opening a deli.) But 'Rock' wants one more chance to show what he's made of after a simulated "Then Vs Now" simulation shows a fight between Rocky and current champ Mason Dixon.<br /><br />Cue Bill Conti and Stallone in sweats. Virtually a tribute to previous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICM5VM">Rocky flicks</a> (complete with multiple flashbacks and Burt Young/Paulie), the movie offers feel-good comments and philosophical asides like a zen-boxing Master. Rocky befriends Marie (Geraldine Hughes) and her son as an antidote to his loneliness, but is far too honorable to move beyond just helping her out. Showing the arrogant champ that the must important muscle being a real champ has is his heart. Proving to glib cynical sportscasters that age is just a number. The movie is very predictable, refuses to play into a maudlin ending, and - most importantly - absolves Stallone from the last few years of sleepwalking through his 90's movies.<br /><br />Interesting note - the filming in Philadelphia had already wrapped when a snowstorm hit that day, and the opportunity for more dramatic settings had arrived. The crew quickly grabbed a camera and filmed an impromptu re-shoot of the street-running scenes, ending with Rocky charging up the steps of the Art Museum in the driven snow.</p></body></html>

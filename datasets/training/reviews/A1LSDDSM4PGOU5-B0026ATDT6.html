<meta name="summary" content="the longest one hundred fourteen minutes and fifty four seconds of my life"></head><body><p>i really wanted to like this film.but it just wasn't meant to work<br />out.not only was it all over the place in terms of<br />tone.comedy/action/drama/adventure.some of which i'm not sure were<br />intentional.the comedy for instance.there are also couple of scenes<br />that don't seem to belong and are not explained,which really annoyed<br />me.but the biggest obstacle to engaging this movie was that it just<br />went on and on and on.i almost couldn't take it.i watched it to the<br />end.but it was a chore.that was what killed the whole experience for<br />me,was just how slow it was.it it hadn't been for that,i might have<br />enjoyed the movie.the actual creature itself was not that bad looking.i<br />have seen worse,and better.i did like the look of the film.it had a<br />certain style to it.and the ending was touching.i started to watch the<br />film in dubbed English but found the dubbing quality not so good,so<br />quickly switched to Korean with English Subtitles,which i would<br />recommend.i can't really recommend this film based on how long it<br />seemed to take to get through,but if you do choose to watch,just know<br />that you may need a great deal of patience 1.5/5</p></body></html>

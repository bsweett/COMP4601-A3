<meta name="summary" content="An Exceedingly Unpleasant Experience"></head><body><p>I'm trying to imagine what an empty, distasteful experience it must have been shooting the film, HARD CANDY.<br /><br />The crew was probably happy to be working.  The actors, same.  Just read the lines, do your best with what you have.  The writer and director (or was it writer/director?)...not a deep thinker.  If he's overly enthusiastic, he must believe this is an awesome film that's gonna knock people on their butts.  If he's introspective and brooding, he's going to try to draw from good performances and mount the story as best he can.<br /><br />But what a cold mess this movie is.<br /><br />Both main characters are unworthy of more than five minutes of my time.<br /><br />He's a creep for picking up a teenage girl and bringing her back for some--"wink, wink, nudge, nudge, phot-tog-graphy, he said."  She quickly turns into such a nasty, psychotic presence that the viewer is left wondering for whom to root for.  And to root for what?  Yes, go ahead and castrate him!  Yes, shake free from her ropes and kill her!  Any young teen girl that cool and sadistic may be just as dangerous to the population as a clumsy pedophile with a camera.  Or was he a pedophile?  In all the back-and-forth accusations and humiliations, I didn't care what happened to either one of them.  I did want to see either both going down horribly...or both just walking away.<br /><br />For one to triumph over the other seemed...hard and unsatisfying.</p></body></html>

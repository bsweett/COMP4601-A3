<meta name="summary" content="Very good, well worth your time"></head><body><p>Let me say it first &quot;The book is better&quot;. But if you judge this film on its own merits then it deserves 4 stars. This is a very good looking film. I love Ridley Scott films, his attention to detail and the way every scene is so well designed in this film is wonderful. Yes, the film is gory in spots but so is Harris' book. <p>The only problem with the movie is that Scott did not spend more time revealing Hannibal's past, why he is so crazy, like in the book.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A case where the parts are greater than the whole"></head><body><p>This is a case where the parts are greater than the whole. Taken altogether, Dr. Strangelove is a good movie that doesn't quite seem to come together. The parts, though; the distinct segments that make up the movie; the masterful cinematography that captures the characters and sets in ways that beautifully heighten their essences; the sexual underpinnings of the most powerful character motivations; the all around great performances including Peter Sellers' triple roles and, most impressive of all, George C. Scott's Buck Turgidson which is so animated, so expressive, and so thoroughly committed that, while it hovers just shy of Sellers' delightfully cartoonish Dr. Strangelove, it remains completely believable. These are what make the film a must see for anyone who loves comedy or good filmmaking, or great acting.</p></body></html>

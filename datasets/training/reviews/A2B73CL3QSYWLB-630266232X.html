<meta name="summary" content="Mesmerizing Film"></head><body><p>This film is an unqualified success.  Superb direction by Otto Preminger.  A story that takes twists and turns that not only have you on the edge of your seat that also makes sense.  Moody black-and-white cinematography that won the Oscar in 1944.  A haunting score by David Raksin.  This also has to be one of the most perfectly cast movies ever.  Dana Andrews is perfectly no-nonsense as Detective MacPherson.  Gene Tierney is not only alluringly beautiful as Laura but captivatingly mysterious.  Clifton Webb gives one of the all-time great supporting turns as the acerbic gossip columnist Waldo Lydecker.  Vincent Price is effectively sleazy as Shelby Carpenter, Laura's layabout fiancee.  Judith Anderson is excellent as a society matron who Carpenter sponges off of.  The film in general does not get it's due probably because it is told in a rather low-key manner and rather unflashy.  That said, it is essential viewing for anyone who fancies themself a film buff.</p></body></html>

The story of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a Rwandan hotel manager who strove to save as many of his neighbors as possible from genocidal government troops, requires no embellishment to make it powerful, and George gives it none: he tells it as straightforwardly as possible, with a minimum of trickery and just enough gore to get the point across. (The relative lack of gore has caused some critics to turn thumbs-down on the movie; if George were really true to the story, they said, it should have been a bloodbath on the level of "Saving Private Ryan." I find myself in agreement with George, however; he said that by toning down the gore and getting a PG-13 rather than R rating, he could reach the young people who really need to know what happened in Rwanda.) The story here is as old as history, and as new as today's evening news: the endless ability of a mob of people to find pretexts to hate and kill, and the vitally important message that one person CAN make a difference, even in the midst of murderous chaos. The film is superbly acted down to the smallest bit part, but special mention must be made of Cheadle, who gives a performance of heartbreaking intensity and purity as Rusesabagina, and Sophie Okonedo, who is deeply moving as Rusesabagina's wife Tatiana. This powerful film is a stern rebuke to us comfortable Westerners, who--as one character in the film points out--watched the horrors in Rwanda unfold on the evening news, said, "How horrible," and went on eating our dinners.</p></body></html>

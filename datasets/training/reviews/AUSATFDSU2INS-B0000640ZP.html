<meta name="summary" content="Ghosts without sixth sense"></head><body><p>A new variation of the classic history of ghosts - an enchanted, solitary and scary house-, returns to the big screen thanks to the excellent hands of director Alejandro Amenabar.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman is Grace, mother of Anne and Nicholas, living in an isolated big house on a European island. The year is 1945 and Grace's husband is fighting against the Nazis in the final days of World War II.<br /><br />The film begins when Grace receives three new servants - a governess, a gardener and a servant who will help at the mansion. Her previous servants went all away; we do not know why.<br /><br />Grace gives few instructions to the help, but the most important thing to do is to keep closed all the doors whenever they change rooms. Apparently, Grace's children suffer a condition that does not allow them to receive sunrays.<br /><br />Thus, the children live without going out, surrounded by shades and candlesticks. Her mother educates them, and many of their lessons are focused on religious values. The children, particularly Anna, feel the presence of other ghostly beings and their actions - doors and windows that are opened without touching them, pianos making music alone.<br /><br />Grace is skeptical in the beginning and does not believe the stories, but it just a matter of time before she's convinced of the reality.<br /><br />Gothic and terrifying, The Others is a thriller that creates a suggestive and dark atmosphere. Supported by the flawless characterizations of the actors and a wonderful script, this film does not rely on the special effects and fast-paced edition that usually defines contemporary terror movies. With genuine moments of terror, Amenabar has constructed a supernatural piece that causes great mental anguish.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman gives a fantastic performance like the rigid and frustrating mother, constantly trying to stay in control of her emotions and to give a logical explanation to all the incomprehensible facts happening before her eyes. Deep down, we see the emotional collapse of a woman forced to accept the destruction of all her beliefs and values.<br /><br />The children are equally memorable in their roles. Next to Kidman, they make us fear everything that hides behind each closed door, the shades rambling in the mansion and the secrets hiding in their corridors.<br /><br />And it's finally when a chilling and unexpected ending is revealed, that The Others smashes us with its impressive weight, disturbing and making us revisit every moment, satisfied for have witnessed such a sublime work.</p></body></html>

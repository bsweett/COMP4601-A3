<meta name="summary" content="Great Suspense Horror movie"></head><body><p>1408 is a great Suspense Horror movie based on one of King's short stories in one of his short stories collection novals.  I personally enjoy the movie by two great actors.  This movie made me jump in a couple of scenes, I am not sure if you actually like the ending of the movie.  But I do enjoy the ending on the special features.  To me that should have been the ending to the movie not the one they used for actual ending.  But if your a fan of Samuel L Jackson and John Cusack then pick this movie up and watch it.  It will keep you entertained from start to finish if your into King's style of suspense, horor, and trillers.  I have been watching it time and time again and never get tired of the movie.  I will also add I am looking forward to buying the movie "The Raven" coming out on DVD in oct.<br />So if you like a good triller with great actors then pick this up and have an evening of suspense and horror.</p></body></html>

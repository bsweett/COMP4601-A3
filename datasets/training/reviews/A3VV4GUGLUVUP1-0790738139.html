Actually, this gorgeously shot retro-noir crime film is full of memorable characters and enhanced by some sharp acting.  But it's just so wonderful to stare at... like a movie version of costar Kim Basinger (who won Best Supporting Actress).  <p>Russell Crowe plays taciturn Bud White, a brutal cop who nuts up when he sees anyone hit a female. Kevin Spacey portrays Jack Vincennes, a flashy-dressing cop who advises a &quot;Dragnet-&quot;style show and, thanks to sleazy journalist Danny DeVito, gets to make headline-grabbing drug busts. And Guy Pearce is Edmund Exley, the ambitious cop whose fortunes rise as his righteousness declines; classic noir &quot;deal with the devil&quot; stuff where the clean-as-a-whistle hero ends up covered with the muck he starts to rake.  It also features perennial favorite character actor James Cromwell as Capt. Dudley Smith, Exley's mentor,  and a character very different from the kindly  farmer he played in &quot;Babe.&quot; <p> And what a plot- it propels itself through a vividly realized City of Angels where capped teeth and brightly-lit movie premieres alike hide dark secrets.  White, Vincennes and Exley get themselves thoroughly embroiled in organized crime, blackmail, prostitution, police and civic corruption and  murders.  Features an unforgettable ending as master politician Exley joins White in a motel room shootout and has to make certain moral choices that will forever alter his life and career, and the Los Angeles police force itself.  This is a classic film, destined to join such greats as &quot;Chinatown,&quot; &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;Sunset Boulevard.&quot;  Just remember... Rollo Tomasi.</p></body></html>

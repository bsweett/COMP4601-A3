<meta name="summary" content="BRITISH BLOWBACK"></head><body><p>This is a fascinating film, dealing with a fictional Scotish doctor as witness to the horrors of Amin's Uganda.  The idealistic Scot is quickly charmed by the Ugandan dictator.  I think McAvoy is a perfect choice, he says so much just through his eyes, he is a witness to the horrors of this British made Frankenstein and you feel his desperation as he tries to find a way out.  Whitaker is fantastic as Amin, he is at once charming at next glace an absolute horror.  The brutality is sickening to watch, especially what is done to one of the central female leads, it's very graphic, but this guy was a sociopath of the first order.  Filming on location in Africa really makes the film come alive.  Its hard to believe that Amin lived out the rest of his days in exile in Saudia Arabia and died of natural causes in 2003, never having paid for his crimes against Uganda.</p></body></html>

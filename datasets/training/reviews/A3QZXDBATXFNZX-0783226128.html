<meta name="summary" content="Good But Not That Good"></head><body><p>Scarface is a good movie but its not that good the performance of Al Pacino is simple amazing. Thats the only reason why you should see the movie the thing I don't like about the movie is Al Pacino charcter hes just to fake. Its just fake no one would have a mind like that but the performance is something differnt his performance is very good but the charcter he portrays is fake. As far as the violence goes its really not that bad compared to films like Meance II Society and Casino its nothing. But the violence is still bad and is for mature audences only.</p></body></html>

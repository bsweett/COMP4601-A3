They just don't make horror films like this anymore.  It's very hard to find a film that chills your bones and gets under your skin like The Shining does, and it's equaly hard to find a villian who haunts you long after you've seen the film like Jack does.  Jack Nicholson nailed this performance with conviction and pure insanity, you could really be afraid of this man.  My only complaint it the overly obnoxious acting on the part of Shelley Duvall who played Jack's wife.  She was really annoying.  Danny Lloyd who played the son Danny (it's funny how both Jack and Danny play charactors named Jack and Danny) was frightening.  I rest my case, little kids are creepy as hell.  The whole redrum scene where he's in his mothers room and he's repeating 'redrum' over and over in this demonic voice, I was cringing...It was so nerveracking.  That poor woman...no matter how annoying she was, she had to deal with a crazy husband weilding an ax and a crazy psychic son.  The scene where she locks Jack in the storage room and he's pleading with her to let him out...where he was like "you hurt my head real bad" I mean, that was acting genious.  This film proved what people have been saying forever...Jack Nicholson is a freaking legend.  Watch this film.  While it may not follow the book to a T Kubrick is a cinimatic master and with Nicholson as his main attraction with is a show worth it's weight in gold.</p></body></html>

There are heavy symbolic messages being thrown at you concerning religion, dictatorships, and the power of the human spirit. Equilibrium was a sci-fi film to the utmost degree. I say this because most of the time you can only cover these topics with a futuristic approach. This allows the director to give us, the viewer, a warning that unless we contain ourselves as humans, this may be the future that we will have to endure. I thought that the actors very well played it out, the direction was steady, and the action was powerful.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have about this film is the story. I felt at times it was rushed and a bit difficult to follow. The basis of this film was to not show emotion, which I felt the actors did very well, but there were times when I thought they were showing emotion and guards were going to come and take them away, but never did. When Bale did break down, why were the other pedestrians of the city not surprised (again, was it because they couldn't show emotion). This is where I started grappling with the overall feel of the film. There should have been a must stricter balance between emotion and non-emotion. I felt that anyone could get away with anything, and with as many spies as they "claimed" being around the city, why were more people not picking up on this?  If Prozium was issued to everyone, why were there some in the city not taking the drug. Take Watson's character. She could have been utilized in a much deeper way, helping to bring not only Bale's character to the surface, but also others around them. I just felt that with this story, there were issues not being addressed and topics not brought out until a very suspenseful moment. I despised, dare I say hated, the scenes between Bale and his son. Sometimes he was calling Bale "Dad" while other time he was using the name "John", then there was the fact that there was a painting in "father's" office, making us question if they had to take the drugs as well ... hum ... there was just not enough consistency.<br /><br />Out of what I disliked and onto what made this film work. First, our actors. I have never seen actors give so much to a small film as I did with this movie. Bale was superb, ranking close to Keanu in his "Neo" role, as the gun-toting officer of the government. Even Sean Bean brought a human feel to this story about emotion. I especially loved Emily Watson. She picks the oddest roles to add to her resume, but simply put ... they work. The acting was only the tip of the iceberg, I loved the action sequences. They were fantastic. I am a sucker for the "bullet-time" style of fighting that was issued in The Matrix and I am always impressed when films use it better or add their own spin to it. Equilibrium was one of those films. The kata style gun fighting was slowed down when needed, or kept the same pace to show the power of the human wielding those powers. It was flashy, but not too flashy. Bale pulled these sequences off with the greatest of ease, only proving that he could be the next Hollywood action hero. The battle between Preston and Brandt was exactly what I was hoping for. While there were a couple of clich&eacute;s that riddled this film, there were scenes of power and originality that gave me more delight than I can wave a stick at. The battle between two of the strongest lasted just as long as I wanted. Bale was the best, and this film never strayed from that idea.<br /><br />The final topic I would like to discuss goes over the symbolic references in this film. Please, look closely and see if you can see the Holocaust references staring you in the face. The most blatant is shown whenever somebody is accused of showing emotion they are burnt in the incinerator. This is a direct reference to what Hitler did to the Jewish prisoners in the concentration camps. Then there was the supreme ruler that just happened to be everywhere people were. He was unavoidable. It reminded me of George Orwell's 1984 in the sense that "Big Brother" was watching those that would not obey. Toss in a pinch of the Salem Witch Trials and you have a little film I like to call Equilibrium. I think I liked this film due to the numerous amounts of references to our culture, yet that was what Bale and his government were trying to destroy. While they thought that our culture was being repressed, it was actually seeping through the seems. They would try to crush it in one section, but it would only cause more distress in another. The never won battle against the culture that helps make us the people that we are today. It was interesting to see a world that was scared of repeating the horrible deeds of their past actually create a carbon copy of the horrific deeds of the Holocaust. Their attempts at a utopia failed because the rulers and the people were afraid of whom they were.<br /><br />Overall, I felt that this film was not without flaws, but it did make a good impression on my mind. It dealt with an issue that is not explored enough in cinema because we embrace the theme in every movie created. What would a film be like without creating any sort of emotion from the audience?  A film full of emotional void being enjoyed by a couple that embraces it. Strange, weird, world that we live in!<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Some flaws, but highly original and intriguing. Another solid film from Shyamalan"></head><body><p>After "The Village" we learned (many would argue, the hard way) to never make any assumptions about a M. Night Shyamalan movie going by the trailer. "Lady in the Water" falls into the exact same category. Simply put, if you liked "The Village" you will like this one. And if you didn't like "The Village" you won't. Because there are many similarities in both movies. But having said that, "Lady in the Water" is a lot more eerier and "out there." This is by far Shyamalan's least commercial film, as if by now he knows that he's established his fanbase and can therefore make any type of film he wants without concerns of whether it will do well at the box office or not.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into the plot of "Lady in the Water" but I will say that this movie definitely has Shyamalan's trademark suspence and creepy atmosphere, up until the very end. The creatures aren't seen often but when they are the special effects are quite convincing. As with "The Village," the entire movie takes place within a confined space. This only adds to the tension, something I'm sure Shyamalan fully intended.<br /><br />I did not like everything about this movie though. The moments of humor seemed awkward to me, way out of place in the context of the film. Same goes for a few characters who were completely absurd (ie: the guy who worked out only half his body). I'm not sure what Shyamalan was trying to convey with these scenes and characters. I found Bryce Dallas Howard's performance rather phoned-in, having only one single expression and talking in a monotone. I know, that's what her role called for. Still, I liked her a lot more in "The Village." And then there's the signature plot twist at the end, which of course I won't reveal. I can't put my finger on it, but it felt lacking to me.<br /><br />I really give "Lady in the Water" 3.5 stars but will round up to 4 because I believe M. Night Shyamalan makes movies that have a lot more substance than the trash that's passed as movies these days. "Lady in the Water" is sure to divide reviewers here...I don't foresee many 3-star reviews. You will either like it or not like it. And maybe this movie will grow on me even more with repeated viewings. In any case, I haven't stopped thinking about "Lady in the Water" after seeing it today, and that to me is a sign of a successful movie.</p></body></html>

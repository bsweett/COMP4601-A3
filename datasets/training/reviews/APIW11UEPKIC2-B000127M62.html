<meta name="summary" content="Ronny Yu got his inspiration for the final fight from Rocky.  OK, I wish I would have known that before I watched this."></head><body><p>I mean wow.<br /><br />Alright, now  this movie just seemed to take the standard style like scream and all the rest.  Luckliy the story has it's own unique type of feel to get you mildly interested throughout the film. I mean it is just bearable and then the final fight happens.  This was easily one of the stupidest things of all time.  Well shot, no doubt, btu just retarded.  I mean come on, after like slicing Jason up like 150 times, if he doesn't die, wouldn't you at least start going for his head?  But somewhat fun just like the whole movie was.<br /><br />Ronny Yu talks about Rocky in the interviews on disc 2.  Also some deleted sces, good featurettes and other goodies in this 2-disc set.<br /><br />Now the commentary was outstanding.  I have never had the oppurtunity to listen to a hong kongt director's commentary.  Beign a huge asian film fan, I actually enjoyed this more than the movie.  And it wasn't Ronny that made it great, Robert Englund is just hilarious.  SO they try to gloss over how bad the movie is but still very enjoyable.<br /><br />I  give the movie a 2 and the special features a 5.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing'...didn't hang together"></head><body><p>Set in French-occupied Germany during the Napoleonic period, the two brothers Grimm, Will and Jake,  travel from village to village, telling tales and tricking the villagers, but stumble into a sinister forest where the realm of  evil queen in her tower, results in a bewitchment in the forest, leading to a number of little girls from the village to disappear.<br />Allusions are made to some of the Grimm tales, such as Red Riding Hood and Hansel and Gretel.<br /><br />I expected two hours of a real treat, of an epic tale involving the Grimm Brothers and the coming to life of many of their characters and creatures in a compelling account.<br />I was  a little  disappointed.<br />The background setting and choreography was really good and the acting was done well with a fantastic supporting cast. And the special effects were amazing.<br />But the script and plot are atrociously written and while I know that the original Brothers Grimm did have a Gothic quality and were even horrific in parts, this just consisted of cheap horror scenes, and cheap comic escapades which didn't hold well together and had little magic quality.<br />What instead was produced was a cheap comic-horror.<br />There is room for a really magical and epic extravaganza of the Brothers Grimm in the vein of the Lord of the Rings, but this is not it.<br />And whatever you do, please do not let any children see this, it will damage them for life.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Blockbuster Garbage"></head><body><p>This film is based on the Tom Clancy novel, is a big budget blockbuster, and is pretty much worthless.  The plot itself has some major flaws, but the main qualm one has is though the actors and scriptwriters are paid millions here, the high budget ironically cheapens the film.  The actors speak their lines very quickly and very loudly, Ben Affleck is one of those everyman megastars, but with no real talent to warrant the stardom.<p>  Morgan Freeman, a great actor, has made some real junk lately from "Deep Impact" to this one.  And Pragna Desai is obviously more intelligent than the lines she is given: "Yawn...double yawn".  Liev Schreiber was good as usual as a CIA operative.<p>  But the most laughable aspect is certain parts of the plot.  Okay I'll accept that Israel was dumb enough to let a nuclear bomb get lost in the desert.  I'll accept that some Arabs found it and sold it.  What I won't accept is that Russian scientists would help Neonazis make the bomb operational, or even the "reasoning" of the Nazis.  Namely to get the Russians and the Americans to fight each other as "times have changed".  Really?<br />So the Cold War didn't really happen?  And the one Nazi with qualms tells the others he is out(what does he think will happen?)<p>  But most incredible of all is the top advisor tells the President, "If they did this to make a point to stay out of Chechnya..."  Yes, you heard that right.  I mean I know in real life Presidencial advisors are dumb, but Russia nukes us to say stay out of Chechnya??!!  So the President authorizes full scale nuclear war based on hearsay.  God help us if we ever get a "Dead Zone" President such as that.<p>  I understand you have to suspend your disbelief for this stuff, but it should have some semblance of reality.  <p>  Even the special effects are disappointing, as the blast is shown for about one minute, and most of it is a helicopter crashing in slow motion and an obviously fake mushroom cloud.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I've Lost Count of the Mutants, But It's A Lot of Fun."></head><body><p>An attack on the President of United States by a mysterious Mutant heightens the tensions between Mutants and Humans and prompts the authorization of an assault on Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. The President gives a secretive former military man named William Stryker (Brian Cox) unprecedented power in detaining and questioning Mutants. Unbeknownst to the President, Stryker has acquired vital information from the imprisoned Magneto (Ian McKellan) regarding Cerebro, which Stryker plans to use to carry out his own agenda against all Mutants. Storm (Halle Berry), Wolverine (Hugh Jackson), Cyclops (James Marsden), Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), Rogue (Anna Paquin), and the students find themselves on the same side as Magneto and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) as they race to foil Stryker's plan.  <p>"X2: X-Men United" is the second film based on the "X-Men" Marvel Comic. Whereas the first film spent a lot of time introducing the characters, this one introduces only three new characters: Pyro (Aaron Stanford), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Nightcrawler, and those introductions are well-integrated in the plot. The first film's coherence suffered considerably from all the backstories. But "X2: X-Men United" is able to concentrate its energies on plot with improved results. The story makes more sense and is much more satisfying than the first film. Both films suffer from having too many characters, which sometimes seem to be like so many gadgets, each with its own gimmick. But I think we're stuck with that problem. Director Bryan Singer has done a good job. "X2" is a lot of fun. It may not be as socio-politically complex as the comic books, but it does manage to raise issues of abuse of power, constitutional protections, minority rights, and the politics of fear, if only briefly. The public is told by their leaders and by the media to fear Mutants, and so the public is inclined to look the other way when their rights are violated and they are flagrantly persecuted. Entertaining and recommended, but if the cast gets any bigger, they will need to wear name tags.</p></body></html>

The movie uses a lot of the same jokes from the last Austin Powers movie, and it doesn't even try to be original. The last two films always tried to raise to bar of comedy to new heights, but this one just gets by off the same jokes as before. It's still good for some laughs that'll entertain you, but I wouldn't expect too much out of it. I thought Mike Myers was still very hillarious in this film as the nefarious Dr. Evil, the heroic Austin Powers, the overweight Fat (...), and the new obscene Goldmember. Overall, it's still a good film to watch, but it's too bad it couldn't live up to its potential.</p></body></html>

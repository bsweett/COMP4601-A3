<meta name="summary" content="The Brave One"></head><body><p>New York City talk show host Erica (Foster) is on the brink of marrying David (Andrews).  She is very happy.  Then one night, they are attacked. David dies and Erica lives.  Unfortunately, she is an emotional wreck.  Just getting the courage to leave her apartment is a challenge.  Once out, she buys a gun - for protection and revenge.  When a few dead bodies start showing up, Detectives Mercer (Howard) and Vitale (Katt) are at a loss to what kind of a person they are dealing with.  Erica's friend ship with Mercer complicates things for her as well.  As the police close in on her, Erica must decide of revenge is really worth it.<br /><br />"The Brave One" is an interesting movie that doesn't provide any easy answers.  Jodie Foster gives an excellent performance as a character who is both vengeful and sympathetic.  Howard and Katt are both good in supporting roles as the detectives.  "The Brave One" is the type of movie to provoke a discussion on what is right, and by giving no real answer it makes itself more interesting.  This is not a movie for everyone, but it is worth seeing.</p></body></html>

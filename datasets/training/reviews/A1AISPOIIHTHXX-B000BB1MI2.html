<meta name="summary" content="Looked great but it didn't play that great"></head><body><p>One thing you can always count on when you get a Tim Burton film is that it'll look visually great. Art direction and production design is always top-notch(except for Planet of the Apes where only the costumes looked good). However, some of them seem to be lacking. Planet of the Apes was boring half the time and had an incredibly stupid ending. Sleepy Hollow looked great but it had a dumb storyline and dialogue choices. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory looked great but halfway through I was wondering if there was a point to the craziness.<br /><br />The most famous chocolate factory in the world is run by reclusive Willy Wonka. One day he announces something surprising: 5 tickets will be inside random chocolate bars. The children who find them gets a tour of the factory. It's been used as a parody for the Slurm Factory in Futurama and the Pawtucket Brewery in Family Guy. This leads them into the factory only each kid ends up receiving a little misfortune until the last one gets something great.<br /><br />One watches the film and is wowed by the sets and the effects used. If you're into this kind of thing, you'll sure find it inventive. My favorite is the Nut Sorting Room where a group of heavily-trained squirrels end up sorting different nuts and putting them in chutes. Another has Oompa-Loompas(a dimnuitive race Willy hired to work the factory) firing fireworks just for the hell of it.<br /><br />One problem I had with the film is how basic everything is. Each kid is your typical one-note persona: the spoiled rich girl, the know-it-all punk, the fat boy and so on. And of course Charlie's soooo good and noble we just know he's going to win the big prize by default. Their fates are actually never dealt with once they come out of the factory. It's like "okay kid, you're a blue flexible kid, have fun" without even returning them to normal. And more than once I asked myself if there's even a plot. 5 kids tour a factory and gets a little snafu. That's it.<br /><br />In terms of the look, it's easily one of Tim Burton's most colorful but as a film it's way down there.</p></body></html>

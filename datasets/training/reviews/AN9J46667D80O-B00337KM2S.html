<meta name="summary" content="He flies through the air with the greatest of ease!"></head><body><p>I don't get to travel nearly as much as I'd like to. I'd love it if I could go to a new city every few months, fly to places I've never been, see all the sites, and all that good stuff. That said, I don't know that I'd want to travel as much as the main character of Jason Reitman's latest film, Up in the Air, an isolated, rootless man whose goal is to reach 10,000,000 frequent flyer miles.<br /><br />George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a man who is on the road over 300 days a year. He's a master business traveler, who knows all the ins and outs of how to get through security quickly, how to get extra miles and comments on the fact that his goal of reaching 10 million miles is one accomplished by only six other people, which is less than the number of people who have walked on them Moon.<br /><br />He lives in airports, first class lounges and airplanes. He has an actual apartment near his home office in Omaha, but it's even more sterile and impersonal than the hotels he stays in.<br /><br />Bingham travels mostly for work, and his job is one I'd not heard of before: he goes to companies that are too gutless to actually fire people and does it for them. He does it in a firm, but not entirely impersonal, way and is very good at his job, and is appalled when he finds out that his company plans to ground him and everyone else and start firing people over the internet.<br /><br />This is one of the most adult movies I've seen, and by that I don't mean that it's filled with violence, sex or anything like that. No, I mean that it's a movie that's made by adults, for adults. It explores adult relationships from a very adult angle. You don't see lots of big hysterics or grand romantic gestures (and the only attempt at one of those backfires). You just adults being adults.<br /><br />Everything about this movie works and works well. The acting is excellent, the directing is top notch, the writing is fresh and intelligent. A particularly nice touch is that the establishing shots showing places like Kansas City and Wichita are done from an airplane looking down, as though one were a passenger. It's a nice touch.<br /><br />This is a completely entertaining and fascinating film. I fully expect it to get several Oscar nominations and rightly so. This is one great movie!</p></body></html>

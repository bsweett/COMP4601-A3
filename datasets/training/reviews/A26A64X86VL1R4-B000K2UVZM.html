<meta name="summary" content="Noir without the shadows!"></head><body><p>Two cops meet while handling street fights between the zoot suit gangs and sailors in 1946.  Bucky (Josh Hartnett) is the young cop who believes in his job.  Lee (Aaron Eckhart) is the cop who plays both sides of the law and has shady connections with local mobsters.  Bucky and Lee become partners and spend lots of time together along with Lee's girlfriend, Kay (Scarlett Johanssen), who has a shady past characterized by ritual violence.  When the woman immortalized as the Black Dahlia is found tortured to death, Lee becomes obsessed with solving the crime.<br /><br />In the process of the murder investigation Bucky becomes involved with Madeline (Hilary Swank), a femme fatale from a rich, corrupt family.  Her mother Ramona (Fiona Shaw) is a drug addict and her father a real estate swindler.  Bucky is in over his head but struggles valiantly to solve the murder and to save Lee and Kay from the miasma of corruption swirling up from the shady past.<br /><br />The film is beautiful and takes advantage of well known Los Angeles landmarks to create a believable Hollywood in which the mood of the 1940's is successfully evoked.  The script uses the pessimistic noir convention of revealing layer after layer of evil and betrayal to the hapless hero who can only keep following the trail to its end.<br /><br />Yet Black Dahlia is a film without shadows, an unflinching stare into the seamy underbelly of corruption, madness and incest.  The scenes of girl-on-girl action, lurid crime scene photos and flashbacks to the murder are more evocative of "Hollywood Babylon" than Chandler.  Not only is the film without the visual noir convention of shadow as a living presence, but when the mystery is finally solved it is nakedly revealed in all its grisly psychopathic ugliness---more suited to a horror film.  For some the final portion will be a little too violent and sensational.  Some cooling and obscuring shadow was much needed.<br /><br />Overall, The Black Dahlia is a good film with some excellent moments.  Hartnett plays the hero who loses his innocence quite well.  Swank is fabulous as always.  Fiona Shaw is amazingly good--frighteningly unbalanced, and in certain lights looks eerily like Mary Astor in the Maltese Falcon.  The rest of the cast performs well with a quibble about Aaron Eckhart's hair--it looks too layered and dry to be 1940's hair.</p></body></html>

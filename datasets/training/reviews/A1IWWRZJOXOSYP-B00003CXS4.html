This was Guy Ritchie's second film after "Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels."  I'm looking forward to Ritchie's "Revolver" with Jason Statham & Ray Liotta.  Obviously, "Swept Away" with wife Madonna starring was a misstep.<br /><br />The cast is excellent.  Jason Statham is now a star after the two "Transporter" films.  As Turkish, he has a droll sense of humor, his own code of ethics and loyalty to his friend Tommy played by Stephen Graham from "Gangs of New York."  Turkish serves as the film's narrator.<br /><br />The obvious scene-stealer is Brad Pitt as the nutty Irish boxer Mickey O'Neil.  Since Pitt's breakthrough role in "Thelma & Louise" back in 1991 and through his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for "12 Monkeys" (1995), he's developed into one of Hollywood's brightest stars.  The frustrating and amazingly hilarious schtick here is that you can barely understand a word of the inarticulate Mickey's dialogue, yet all his friends nod and agree profusely.  It really is funny once you get into the swing of noncomprehension.  The fight scenes are also excellent.<br /><br />Somewhat overlooked, but equally impressive is the short cameo of Benicio Del Toro as the Jewish gangster Franky Four Fingers who loves crime but has a weakness for gambling.  Del Toro is obviously a highly regarded actor with his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for "Traffic" (2000) and his nomination for "21 Grams" (2003).  His ability to go from Jewish Orthodox to the volatile Frankie demonstrates great range.<br /><br />Vinnie Jones plays Bullet Tooth Tony who is hired to find Frankie.  He does a great job.  Jones was excellent in "Swordfish" (2001) and is set to appear in next year's "X-Men 3."  Lennie James who was in "Sahara" this year plays Sol who owns the pawnshop and has two bumbling cohorts to help get him in trouble.  Alan Ford who was in "American Werewolf in London" back in 1981 and in "Exorcist: The Beginning" last year plays the wild gang leader Brick Top who likes to feed his enemies to the pigs.  Rade Sherbedgia who was in a film "Fever" (2003) with Vanessa Redgrave & Angelia Jolie (--makes you wonder, eh?--), plays the delightfully sinister Russian gangster Boris the Blade.  Dennis Farina who had a great cameo in the HBO mini-series "Empire Falls" romps around as Avi.  And of course, the dog that swallows the diamond is also tremendously funny!<br /><br />"Snatch" is excellent because it combines the MTV-style editing with a complex plot whose unifying element is the stolen diamond.  It's so fast-paced that it demands the viewer to be engaged or get lost in the action.  Ritchie and this excellent cast make this a memorable DVD.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

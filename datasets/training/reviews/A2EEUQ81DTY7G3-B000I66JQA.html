<meta name="summary" content=""If it's a choice - Richmond and death, then I choose death""></head><body><p>I've viewed this movie four times now, and there's always something different to see. The Hours is an absolutely superlative film, and is easily one of the best films of the past few years. Whether it is a meditation on suicide, a celebration of the gift of life, deference to literature, or a steadily evolving triptych of three angst-ridden women, The Hours packs a huge emotional punch. On this viewing, it is again easy to see why Nicole Kidman won the Oscar for best actress - her portrayal of the depressive, mentally ill Virginia Woolf who, on doctors orders, is banned from London and is confined to the suffocation of the country - will probably go down in history as one of the great moments of screen acting.<br /><br />Based on Michael Cunningham's book, The Hours tells of one day in the life of three women, each from different time periods. Their lives intertwine and intersect in surprising ways and it is almost as though they are communicating with one another across the eons. They are linked by frustration, despair and the difficulty they have in finding places for themselves in the world. They also share a relationship to yet another fictional woman, the title character of one of Virginia Woolf's most famous novels, Mrs. Dalloway.<br /><br />The film begins with Virginia Woolf (a riveting Nicole Kidman) narrating a suicide note to her husband. The year is 1941 and she has wrestled with madness for many years and feels another spell of it coming on. Rather than subject her husband to it, whom she says has made her so very happy, she drowns herself in a river. The story then flashes back to 1921 when she and Leonard, her husband (an excellent Stephen Dillane), are living a secluded life in rural Richmond. Virginia is terribly unhappy, and feels as though the country is contributing to her mental suffocation. This confinement is made all the more maddening when her lively sister (Miranda Richardson) comes to visit from swinging, sophisticated London.<br /><br />Virginia's story acts as the framing device for the two other stories: Housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore, who should also have won an Oscar) is living in Los Angeles in 1951. She is drowning in a sea of marriage and motherhood. She loves her son and her husband (John C. Reilly), but when her best friend Kitty (an incredible Toni Colette) comes to visit, Laura realizes that life is not worth living, and considers abandoning her family. She contemplates suicide, but before she does this, she anxiously bakes a birthday cake for her husband and restlessly reads Mrs. Dalloway. Meryl Streep plays Clarissa Dalloway living in New York in 2001. Clarissa happily lives with her lover (Alison Janney) and is preparing a party for her best friend Richard (Ed Harris), who has just one a major poetry prize and is dying of AIDS. In 1921 Virginia begins to write Mrs. Dalloway, in 1951 Laura reads Mrs. Dalloway, and in 2001 Clarissa organizes party, just as Mrs. Dalloway did in the novel.<br /><br />This circular, multi-layered narrative is held together with Phillip Glass's melodious, and unobtrusive musical score and some of the best editing techniques, which intimately inter-cut the stories by means of parallel gestures and words. Throughout the day each woman's life unfolds and the viewer soon learns that each is faced with certain choices about whether they should choose life over death. Both Laura, through her actions, and Virginia, though her writing, question why we should persist in holding on to our existence despite the pain it is sure to cause us.<br /><br />The Hours is about those things we don't say because they don't fit into words; it's a film of lost feelings, bizarre, unscrambling emotions and trying to figure out what lies beneath the surface. We are all terribly alone, and that the relationships that we do develop between people are often intransient and frequently fragile. The Hours is a grand, melancholy and uneasy film that is multifaceted and full of meaning.<br /><br />Unrecognizable in a false nose and Ann Roth's excellent costumes, Kidman has gotten a death grip on this character. The climax comes with her riveting monologue on a train station, where, with tears in her eyes, and the look of pain on her face, she desperately argues with her husband to return them to London. It's a scene of spellbinding emotional power, as we see Woolf's controlled turmoil of creativity, her all-consuming mental anguish, and perhaps a portent of the welcoming blissfulness of her death.

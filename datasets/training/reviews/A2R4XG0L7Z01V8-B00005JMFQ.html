<meta name="summary" content="Despite my misgivings, I really liked it"></head><body><p>I've heard some bad stuff about this movie. The couples aren't given that much screen time etc. But I was surprised, when I sat & watched it, with the wind howling outside, and found myself really enjoying it, and laughing along.<br /><br />Apart from each couple's separate storylines, the movie is also a spot-the-celebrity kinda thing, and there's some surprising cameos in there. Some of the more recognisable cast include: Bill Nighy, Gregor Fisher, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Kris Marshall, Martin Freeman, Andrew Lincoln, Keira Knightley, Hugh Grant, Martine McCutcheon, Laura Linney, Junior Simpson, Alan Rickman, Ant McPartlin, Declan Donnelly, Billy Bob Thornton (playing an almost spot-on US president!), Michael Parkinson, Rowan Atkinson, Elisha Cuthbert, Claudia Schiffer (for her one-minute cameo, she received a reported ?200,000), Nancy Sorrell, Shannon Elizabeth, and Denise Richards.<br /><br />My favourite character in all of this was Martin Freeman for definite. I'd only seen him before in the UK show, The Office, but he actually looked really cute in this! His hair was a bit messed up, and he got his kit off! It's amazing, cos he's filming what looks like a very bad porn movie, and they're faking all the positions etc, and him & the girl get together by the end of the movie! The girl also appears topless, which is no doubt to make the guys watch it. Martin is terrific in this movie though.<br /><br />I got quite soppy at the wedding scene with a very blonde and very skinny (b*tch) Keira Knightley. That scene was so romantic and I think I went all gooey inside!<br /><br />The whole scenes between Colin Firth and L&uacute;cia Moniz, are hilarious! There's quite a few subtitles, but they're so funny! The lake that L&uacute;cia and Colin are "swimming" in was actually only 18-inches deep and they had to kneel around and pretend to be in deeper water. It was also over-run by mosquitoes and Colin Firth was badly bitten and his elbow swelled up to the size of an avocado, requiring medical attention. This scene is the funniest:<br /><br />[Aurelia jumps into the lake with hardly any clothes on to save Jamie's book]<br />Jamie: Oh God, she's in. And now she'll think I'm a total spaz if I don't go in too.<br />[takes off his sweater]<br />Aurelia: [in Portuguese] [...]. It's cold.<br />[Jamie falls in]<br />Jamie: [...]. It's freezing! [...]<br />Aurelia: [in Portuguese] This stuff better be good.<br />Jamie: It's not worth it you know, this isn't bloody Shakespeare.<br />Aurelia: [in Portuguese] I don't want to drown saving some [...] my grandmother could have written.<br />Jamie: Just stop, stop.<br />Aurelia: [in Portuguese] What kind of idiot doesn't make copies?<br />Jamie: I really must do copies.<br />[beat]<br />Jamie: You know, there'd better not be eels in here. I can't stand eels.<br />Aurelia: [in Portuguese] Try not to disturb the eels.<br />Jamie: [screams in shock because of the eels] Oh God, what the hell is that?<br /><br />Hugh Grant plays virtually the same character he did in Bridget Jones (except he's the prime minister), including calling Margaret Thatcher a "saucy minx", and making some little jokes about the person before him, having a scary wife, and horrible children.<br /><br />When David arrives at No. 10 Downing Street, his tie changes 11 times between shots when meeting Natalie. Apparently, Hugh Grant had changed his tie after a post-lunch nap and no one noticed at first. They decided to "play with it" and went all out and changed the tie 11 times just for the heck of it.<br /><br />I've seen quite a few reviews, that complain about the ending, but so what if the ending is left hanging? It's the exact same way as life, nothing ever ends perfectly, nor are all the loose ends tied up.<br /><br />What could be done with this movie, is make little spin-offs, and see what happened with all the characters. Of course, then they'd probably be a pile of trash. But there are some of the characters I would like to follow up.<br /><br />Despite the greatness of the movie, it does have its flaws. Why are almost all the women servants or assistants and almost all of the men more powerful (bosses, prime ministers, authors etc)? Women serve lots of coffee in this film! And the more ambition they tend to show (sexual or work-wise), the more villainous they seem. This movie has a very old-fashioned view of the sexes. Why are there no gay couples? With so many couples present, it could have been easily done.<br /><br />I doubt many guys would like to see this movie, and would probably moan right the way through - and not in the way you would like, believe me! This is an outright girly movie, something to spend time cuddled up to your duvet/cuddly toy, with hot chocolate, or having a girly afternoon with your mates. Make your guy watch on the promise of something else later.</p></body></html>

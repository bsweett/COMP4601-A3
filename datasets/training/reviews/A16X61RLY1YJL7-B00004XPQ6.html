<meta name="summary" content="A very stirring look at the Revolutionary War!"></head><body><p>Mel Gibson of course is at his best in this film.  His love of children is very evident.  While by no means an accurate depiction of historical events, this film does give you the feel and look of the war.  One of the most impressive scenes in the movie for me was very early in the movie, when Mel Gibson walks out on the porch and the war is right there, live and in action in your back yard.  Despite what the critics might say, the film does an excellent job in showing that the Revolutionary War was in everybody's back yard.  All of the actors did an excellent job to include Jason Isaac's, playing Colonel Tavington.  He rather seemed to be enjoying himself in the role.  Overall, an excellent movie and well worth the money for the DVD and time spent to watch it.</p></body></html>

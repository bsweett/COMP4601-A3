<meta name="summary" content="Mindless Zombie Gorefest in Guise of Serious Apocalypse Film"></head><body><p>Good special effects and an ambitious Apocalypse virus scenario grip you for the first part of the film.  Animal rights activists let out monkeys with a virus that's so aggressive it wipes out the population of England in 28 days.  The DVD contains interviews with scientists saying, yes, viral pandemics are dangerous.  So this film pretends to be realistic while wallowing in mindless gore.  Pretty much a cross between Night of the Living Dead and 12 Monkeys (without the time travel), a group of survivors travel to Manchester to find salvation in a radio broadcast of army troops.  The scenes of a deserted London are well done (looks like London on Sunday morning 6AM).  All the while they fight off blood spewing zombies.  So one inconsistency among many here is with all the blood all over the place, the film starts with survivors wearing blood-proof full body and head protection, but this contradicts the rest of the film where they are unfazed when infected blood spews all over them.  Of course watching a film with nothing but actors in burka-like covering would be boring, especially for the gore fans.<br /><br />  Danny Boyle directed Trainspotting, and the satire that works there is conspicuously absent here.  I wanted to see thoughtfulness in the script, but found little.  Why is it the trend to make Apocalypse/Disaster films into shallow studies in action, violence, and gore?  For mass appeal?  Anyway the gore scenes are intense enough to recommend keeping kids away from the film.  On the other hand adults can laugh at some of them as they attempt to be as over-the-top as you can get.  Skip it and watch 12 Monkeys or Night of the Living Dead instead.</p></body></html>

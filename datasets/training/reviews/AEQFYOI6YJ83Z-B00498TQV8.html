It's an intimate portrait of rural Missouri, revolving around seventeen-year-old Ree, whose meth-manufacturing father has left her to care for two younger siblings and a sick mother.  Ree's father Jessup has gone missing, but he put his property up for bond.  Meaning, if Ree doesn't find her father within a week--either that, or proof that he is dead--she looses the house and the land.  Unfortunately, her father's extended family seems inclined to let sleeping dogs lie, to the extent that Ree finds herself in genuine danger.  Her only accomplice, if you can call him that, is her uncle Teardrop, who may be as dangerous as everyone else around her.<br /><br />As Ree, Jennifer Lawrence carries this film on her more-than-capable shoulders; she is the rock of the film, anchoring it down so tightly that even the other stellar performances--especially John Hawkes as Teardrop--pale by comparison.  A lot of the cast aren't even professional actors, which lends the film an extra air of authenticity (that, and the fact that it was shot on location).  WINTER'S BONE is, without a doubt, a small production; and while that can sometimes ruin a movie, here it helps.  The script is good though not wholly memorable; the real grit here lies in the actors' performances, without which this film would've been a mediocre idea and best forgotten.  As is, it's nominated for 4 Academy Awards, and goes down as one of the best films of 2010 (a year in which quite a few good movies were made).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A cautionary tale and a modern urban horror film"></head><body><p>This is a film about the Mafia but there are other aspects that make it such a memorable film , such as being in a gang no matter what the cost and the demands of keeping up a certain lifestyle .<br /><br />Martin Scorcese takes you on a ride that is a little draining but the actors show you why that is . The people either burn out , go to jail or die .<br /><br />One could say that the moral of the film is that ' crime doesn't pay ' , but that would be too simplistic and there are more layers to the film .<br /><br />The commentaries are informative and the Special Edition is very welcome .<br />Buy this version of the film to get a better perspective on the whole thing .</p></body></html>

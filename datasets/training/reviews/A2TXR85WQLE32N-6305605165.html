Frank Capra's classic movie carries the simple but powerful message that everyone can be a hero in their own lives, and no one is poor who has friends.<br /><br />The story features James Stewart as George Bailey, a banker in the small town of Bedford Falls.  Facing financial ruin on Christmas Eve, he comtemplates suicide.  His guardian angel, Clarence, gives him an opportunity to see his life as it might have been without him.  George, although hardworking, good-hearted, happily married, and modestly successful, has unluckily never had the opportunity to pursue bigger dreams outside Bedford Falls.  In the disturbingly dark alternate version of his life, we discover that George had a postive impact on a lot of people over the years, and without him, those lives went badly wrong.  In the end, George is offered the chance to return to his life as he has lived it, and discovers the true value of friendship.<br /><br />"It's a Wonderful Life" features an exceptionally solid cast and crisp black and white cinematography.  Frank Capra's excellent direction carries us through the emotional gauntlet of George Bailey's painful voyage of discovery about the truth of his life. The feel-good ending will make the viewer appreciate his or her own Christmas as the annual small miracle it is.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as a family Christmas movie on a par with the better versions of Dicken's "Christmas Carol."</p></body></html>

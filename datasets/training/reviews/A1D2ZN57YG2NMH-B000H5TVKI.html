For several years now, my dad and I get together and watch movies like Rambo, Predator, Terminator etc. Anyways, this has been a classic for all of those years, and still holds true. One of things that I found interesting about this film is it's creepy undertone. The way those cops obsessively chase and threaten John Rambo is a mysterious journey into the heart of violent obsession. The action is also top notch, with enough explosions and gun fights to make any adreanline junkie happy. Another strong point is the acting by Stallone which is superb, and the score by Goldsmith that helps make the film classic.<br /><br />Definately a milestone.</p></body></html>

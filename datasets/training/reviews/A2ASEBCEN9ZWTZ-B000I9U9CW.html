<meta name="summary" content="Intense"></head><body><p>Phone Booth is easily one of the most intense 80 minutes in film history.  Word to the wise, never pick up a ringing public telephone.<p>THE STORY:<p>Stu Shephard (Colin Farrell) is a Manhattan publicist guilty of a few things:  being a somewhat dishonest businessman and lustfully fawning after a young actress, Pamela (Katie Holmes) despite being married.  Little does he know that someone's been watching him lust after Pam.  When Stu enters his Manhattan phone booth to talk to Pam (as has been his ritual) he's taken hostage by a psychotic sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) who's determined to make "bad men" repent for their unrighteous actions.  Things go from bad to worse for Stu when he's accused of shooting a street pimp from the booth and the swat team arrives to take him into custody.  Unfortunately for him, the sniper won't let him leave the booth till he confesses his sins.<p>THE COOL THINGS:<p>It amazes me that the entire movie takes place on a street corner in a phone booth - all 80 minutes of this movie.  It amazes me further that the movie manages to remain engaging and enthralling.  The suspense maintained by the movie is very reminiscent of Sutherland's other current big profile work, namely 24.<p>The sniper character voiced by Sutherland is easily the highlight of the movie.  The sniper is obviously a psychotic stalker and killer.  However, he is also at the same time an avenging angel with an odd sense of justice.<p>BEST SCENES:<p>Well, quite honestly, the whole movie is basically one big scene at the phone booth.  At a brisk 80 minutes the movie moves along at a brisk pace and is quite honestly one big thrill ride.<p>THE DVD FEATURES:<p>Not much to write home about here.  For the DVD you get the now standard director's commentary (great listen) plus the theatrical trailer for the movie.<p>THE VERDICT:<p>At a short 80 minutes "Phone Booth" is perfect viewing - a quick but intense thrill ride.  Think of it like a quick high, it doesn't last very long but is worth every minute.<p>Highly Recommended</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Slightly Different From The Original, But Primarily The Same"></head><body><p>"Final Destination 2" picks up one year after the original flick ended.  By now, all but one of the original survivors of Flight 180 have died in freak accidents.  The only survivor, Ali Larter's character, is safely tucked away in a padded cell.  The movie begins with, and I know this will shock you, a huge pile-up on the highway.  Instead of a young boy having a premonition, it's a young girl this time.  She attempts to stop the accident and, another shocker, she survives, as well as a small group of strangers who have nothing in common except for the fact that they were still breathing even though Death meant for them to be pushing up daisies.<br /><br />What ensues is similar to the original.  The young girl seeks out the help of Larter and manages to gather all of the survivors from her premonition in an attempt to thwart Death.  One by one they are picked off in some rather original death scenes.  There are excessive buckets of blood, impalings, decapitations, and even a wicked fence.  The only twist in this flick is that the creepy undertaker from the original(the guy from "Candyman") leaks out that only new life can stop Death's cycle. Other than that, the victims attempt to determine who'll die next, look for warning signs, and try to stay safe.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first flick, you'll probably like this one.  In fact, I enjoyed this one more than the original because of the fancy and fiendishly funny ways that Death whoops up on his victims.  From pigeons to PVC, Death uses everything at his disposal to take out his prey.<br /><br />Like I said, you'll like this if you liked the first one, just don't expect to be taken away by the acting, effects, etc.<br /><br />Recommended to those who love gorefests and somewhat funny "horror" flicks(though there isn't anything too "horror" about this one).</p></body></html>

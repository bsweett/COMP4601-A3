You don't even notice the time as a factor. I thought, going in, that this movie was going to be too short to notice a thing. But it is quite the opposite. Here, you have a good combination of the necassary elemnts of a thriller. Rachael Mcadams is a very naturalistic actress. And the man that she meets is equally gifted in the acting field. He's one of those universal joints of actors. A man that can play any role. Though, after this one, he might be typecast to do roles leaning more towards villians.<br /><br />It all starts with a normal, everyday, hotel manager who's flying back home. Whilst waiting for the plane she meets a friendly stranger who instantly clicks with her. He's even seated right next to her on the plane. What a coincidence! It is right when we learn more of the woman's history that we are delved into a hyper-tension acition thriller that is smart, fast, and very go for the throat surprises. You'll be on the edge of your seat. Be sure to keep the tray tables up. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

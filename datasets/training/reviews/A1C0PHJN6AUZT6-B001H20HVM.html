<meta name="summary" content="A pretty decent sequel"></head><body><p>If you liked Saw, I'm willing to bet that you'll like Saw 2 as well. Jigsaw's back, and some questions are answered, while new ones emerge. I think that the premise is very unrealistic compared than the first one, though. 2 guys chained in the bathroom, and people killed one by one in "tests?" Okay, I bought it. A whole bunch of people on a moniter is much harder to believe. But once you get into, it's pretty good. It sets you up for Saw 3, which is a better movie.</p></body></html>

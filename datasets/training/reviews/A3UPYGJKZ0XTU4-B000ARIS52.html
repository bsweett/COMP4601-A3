<meta name="summary" content="Live-Action Graphic Novel, but Dull, Monotonous Movie."></head><body><p>"Sin City" is a live-action graphic novel that adapts 3 of Frank Miller's books for the big screen: "The Hard Goodbye","That Yellow Bastard", and "The Big Fat Kill". Actors were shot against a green screen, and all of their environment is computer generated imagery. The result is a fairly accurate representation of Frank Miller's graphic style, judging by the little I have seen of it. The film is high-contrast black and white with splashes of color. The visual style might be described as a caricature of classic film noir's low-key lighting. The story takes place mostly at night, often on shiny, rain-soaked streets. There is a stunning lack of detail and depth of field, which I found too simplistic for the big screen, but it resembles drawings on the 2-dimensional pages of a book. In fact, the entire film is a caricature of classic film noir, although Frank Miller and co-director/editor Robert Rodriguez are lesser visual stylists and bigger romantics than the artists of classic film noir.<br /><br />We are presented with three stories whose single common element is a bar called "Kadie's". Police Detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis) has tracked an 11-year old kidnap victim to a city warehouse, where she is in the clutches of a perverse murderer (Nick Stahl) with powerful political connections. Hartigan can outwit and outgun the murderer, but defeating the corruption behind him will prove more resilient. Marv (Mickey Rourke) is a psychotic, intensely violent ex-con. When his girlfriend Goldie (Jaime King) is murdered, his search for her killer leads him to the dungeon of cannibal-murderer Kevin (Elijah Wood) and up the chain of corruption. Shellie (Brittany Murphy), a barmaid at Kadie's, is trying to get rid of her abusive ex-boyfriend Jackie (Benicio Del Toro) in favor of the better-mannered Dwight (Clive Owen). Dwight follows Jackie into "Old Town", a red light district ruled by the prostitutes who live and work there, with the intention of ridding  the world of Jackie's menace. But the ladies, led by Gail (Rosario Dawson), have Jackie in their sights as well.<br /><br />"Sin City" is the second feature film to place actors in an entirely computer-generated environment, and it suffers from many of the same limitations as 2004's "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow": one-dimensional characters and visual tedium. Like "Sky Captain", "Sin City" is fascinating to look at for about 10 minutes. After that it's dull, dull, dull. I was intrigued by the idea of CGI films for a while, but, having seen 2 of them at this point, I have to say that they cannot create anything close to the visual interest of photography. "Sin City" is essentially an animated film, and it's not a very good one. The characters are one-dimensional and thoroughly unengaging. They all have the same personality, and they all do the same thing. The droning of incessant voice-over narration is so grating that I found myself tuning it out. The project might have fared better as 3 short films, which would break up the visual and narrative monotony.<br /><br />On the bright side, if you want to see Frank Miller's work brought to life "Sin City" does that -more literally than for its own good. Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba, as exotic dancer Nancy, generate some real charisma. But they are the only actors who do. These characters and storylines are not nearly sophisticated enough for a feature film, and neither is the CGI. "Sin City" is one of those rare films that had me looking at the clock every 10 minutes. I was profoundly bored. Watching the film has all the excitement of watching someone else play a computer game. You might have better luck if you consider it a live-action graphic novel instead of an actual film. Robert Rodriguez said, "I didn't want to make Robert Rodriguez's 'Sin City'. I wanted to make Frank Miller's 'Sin City'." And so he did. The trouble is that Frank Miller's "Sin City" is not cinematic. Note that the film is ultra-violent and not for the squeamish.<br /><br />The DVD (Dimension 2005): The single bonus feature is a "Behind the Scenes" (8 1/2 minutes), which features interviews with Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, "guest director" Quentin Tarantino, and some members of the cast. They talk about the vision behind the film, but there is no discussion of technical details. Odd that we don't get more bonus features on a Robert Rodriguez film, but there it is. Subtitles for the film are available in Spanish. Captioning available in English. Dubbing available in French.</p></body></html>

That's vanity."></head><body><p>During their interviews in last year's "Infamous", Truman Capote and Harper Lee speak to a grizzled farmer who attended church with the brutally murdered Clutter family. He tells of how the killings scared him and disrupted his view of the world's balance and order.  Despite all the good done by Herb Clutter, when the evil winds blew, they whisked him away like a feather. "You're in control until you're not in control", the old man says. "Then you're helpless."<br /><br />Such powerlessness in the face of evil echoes through No Country for Old Men, the instant classic from Joel and Ethan Coen. In a quest to recover stolen drug money, evil incarnate (Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem) decimates anything in his way with almost supernatural power.  Bardem's mesmerizing portrayal immediately takes a place next to the quintessential evil men in film history, from Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter to Jack Palance's gunslinger Wilson from Shane.  Yes, he's that good.  In Chigurh's wake is left the bodies of his former colleagues and rivals and an endless string of seemingly good townsfolk who just happened to be in the wrong place when the evil winds came a-blowin'.<br /><br />Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is the object of Chigurh's pursuit. While hunting antelope, Moss discovers the drug money and soon realizes his great fortune comes tethered to an even greater price. The unrelenting, unstoppable Chigurh finds his way to all of Moss hiding spots, always armed with weaponry rivaling in creativity the arsenal of Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle. I'm far from a gun nut, but the two devices of death primarily used by Bardem in this film are flat out cool.<br /><br />The search for Moss and the ensuing body count plays out under the nose of Tommy Lee Jones' aging lawman, the film's conscious and analytic voice. As the man in the best position to save the innocent (and not so innocent) from Bardem's monster, Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom Bell slowly realizes the futility of trying to stop evil. As an old friend and mentor tells him, wickedness has always and will always exist, and anyone who believes they can stop it falls victim to vanity.<br /><br />No Country for Old Men gives this seemingly nihilistic view to its audience, with an ending that will no doubt disappoint those expecting men in white horses to ride in and save the day. In fact, viewers expecting any kind of traditional ending (either good or bad) will find the ambiguous close of this film frustrating. Several people stayed in the theater through the credits when I watched it, as they almost demanded or even willed an additional scene to find its way to the reel.<br /><br />This difficult lack of closure, these frayed knots left untied shouldn't be the film's legacy. Up until the ending, No Country for Old Men gives its viewers a merciless edge-of-your-seat ride, full of some of the most unforgettable characters and scenes in years.  Its heightened sense of drama and tension is unmatched in anything since The Shining.  This film will cause you sleepless nights, as your only comfort will be knowing that you don't have a bag of Anton Chigurh's money, and he's not coming for you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="both more and less than i thought it would be"></head><body><p>great idea . pretty good story telling . some flawed prosthetic work (the lovely japanese girl) . yeah , that was the point at which the picture kinda derailed for me a pretty fair bit . i thought the acting was uniformly quite good .the ease of our hero's escape strained credibility a good measure also . oh , and the street urchin flip/flop was silly as well . glad i saw it to judge for myself . glad we had a likable and winning protagonist . satisfactory . i liked MR. ROTH'S CABIN FEVER a bit more . i'd recommend both to folks with strong stomach's .</p></body></html>

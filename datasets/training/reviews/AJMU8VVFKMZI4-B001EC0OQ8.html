<meta name="summary" content="A classic indeed"></head><body><p>Talk about a movie that is standing the test of time.  I've put off seeing this movie for I don't know how long.  For some reason I had fixed in my mind that I wouldn't like it--BUT boy was I wrong.  Bogart shines like the star he was.  He commands every scene his in and is able to whip out this fast talking piece with convincing believability.  One thing for sure, you have to pay attention or you can easily get lost.  The only angle I thought that could have been cut is the whole you love me I know you do stuff.  When Mary Astor start spitting that nonsense I started wondering when did anyone have time to fall in love in this movie.  Great script, good direction.  And all around winner in my book.</p></body></html>

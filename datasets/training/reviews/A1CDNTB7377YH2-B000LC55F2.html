<meta name="summary" content="The Twists and Turns Never End!"></head><body><p>Two rival magicians (Jackman and Bales) in the late 1800's.  Each trying to sabotage each other, outdo each other, and decode the secrets of each others tricks.  The twists and turns in this movie never seem to end.  The story even brings in Houdini's water closet escape trick as well as the great scientist Tesla.  The story does exaggerate a lot about Tesla but it seems to work in this film.<br /><br />The acting is first class and Michael Caine puts in another great supporting spot.  Scarlett Johannsan is not quite as good as Jessica Beals was in The Illusionist but she is acceptable a the magician's assistant and lover.<br /><br />I would have given the film 5 stars but I was a little disappointed with the ending which seemed too implausible.</p></body></html>

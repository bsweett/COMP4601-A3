<meta name="summary" content="A HAUNTINGLY, BEAUTIFUL LULLABY FOR ADULTS"></head><body><p>Guillermo del Toro's PAN'S LABYRINTH is a sublimely imaginative, exquisitely refined dark fairy tale that weaves grim reality, and sumptuous dreamlands together with what seems like effortless ease. Ivana Baquero as Ofelia, a 12-year old caught up in Franco's war, is superb ( as is the rest of the cast ). This marvelous film may lack the humor of films like Caro and Jeunet's equally wonderful, THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, or Peter Jackson's epic THE LORD OF THE RINGS, but it is every bit as moving. It's a bit violent for children, but this is high fantasy at it's very best.</p></body></html>

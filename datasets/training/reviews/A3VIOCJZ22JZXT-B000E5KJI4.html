<meta name="summary" content="The story of Troy for our modern age"></head><body><p>The director of this film made a wise decision: make this retelling of the story of the Trojan war realistic for modern audiences. The original Illiad by Homer (on which this movie is based) is full of gods and goddesses playing with the human characters as if they were puppets. By cutting out all the gods and goddesses, we have a more clean to-the-point epic of ambition, power, love, and warfare. The characters are dirty, sweaty human beings and as fellow human beings we recognize the struggles they face.<br /><br />Some of the great themes of literature are raised in this film. One of these is the nature of leadership. What a wonderful contrast in leadership we see between Achilles ( a beautiful killing machine), Agamemnon (a ego maniac constantly consolidating power), Ullyses (a wise manipulating survivor),  King Priam (a patrician who trusts the gods), and Hector (a loving family man of character who unfortunately must face the demi-god Achilles in mortal combat).<br /><br />There is a price for editing out all the gods (Apollo, Athena,Juno, Neptune, and Aphrodite) in that the manipulations of the gods explain the motives of some of the characters. For example, when Paris selects Aphrodite as the most beautiful of the goddesses, his prize (or bribe) is that the most beautiful women in the world will love him upon first sight. Helen (herself a demi-god since she is the daughter of Zeus and Leda) is that woman and we are never convinced in the film that this woman would leave her husband for the young pretty boy, Paris.<br /><br />We also don't understand the sacrifice Agamemnon made to the war. The gods would not give him winds for his fleet until he sacrificed his daughter, Iphegenia. This messy scene was never shown.<br /><br />Also, the link between Ulysses and Achilles is never explained. Remember that it is the trickster Ulysses who finds the adolescent Achilles hidden in women's clothes because his mother knows he will die a warrior.<br /><br />The acting was very good. Peter O'Toole as King Priam was a standout. Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana as the brothers Paris and Hector were superb. Saffron Burrows as Hector's suffering wife Andromache conveyed the personal and national crisis of Hector's death.<br /><br />But what was the best scene in the film?  The scene where King Priam comes to Achilles tent in the enemy camp to beg for his son's mangled body so that it might be washed and given a burial. O'Toole plays the role perfectly of a patrician,noble old man who has lost his beloved son and must now beg the killer for the corpse. Pitt does a good job of showing a man who was consumed with his own anger and grief begin the process of healing by discovering compassion and empathy within himself.<br /><br />And what was the best line in the film?  As Hector leaves his family to go outside the city gates to face Achilles, his father King Priam, puts his hands on his son's shoulders and says: "No man has ever had a finer son that you have been to me." These are the words every son wishes to hear his father say, unfortunately sometimes it takes crisis for us to open our hearts.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Gee All Poor Leatherface Needed Was Some Skin Cream and a Shrink"></head><body><p>There is a terrifying trend in modern horror films, villians with psychiatric issues. I for one find this to be a cheap pitiful cop out, and just silly. This movie although filmed dark and moody isn't really scary and Leatherface comes off as that weird kid in school who had a lot of acne who just finally snapped. Why filmmakers find the need to remake everything these days is beyond me, but this one was really unnecessary, the updating doesn't really help this time around. Maybe Leatherface was just crazy, why can't these villians just be sick in the head without the new personal self image troubles, c'mon people save that crap for the next Hilary Duff movie. Tobe Hooper this movie is an insult to what you created and I apologize for having even seen it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="SINGULAR WILL"></head><body><p>I had watched the earlier version of this movie, The Omega Man, on late night T.V., when I was a kid and I was totally spooked by it, the beginning was so creepy, with Heston all alone in Downtown L.A. and as he loses track of time and we see the sun fade into the sunset we are not sure why he is in a panic; it was really cool cinema.  Most people now look at that film as 70's camp, but frankly I liked it for what it was, which is why i looked forward to this film, I liked the idea of Will Smith taking the role and the move to NYC as the location.  The first half of the movie rocked, id give it five stars, but the second half and the fact that the CGI vampires didnt work at all, forced an overall three star rating.  Smith is very good in this, frankly I think he is way better by himself than when bouncing off of other actors, I think this is his best role since Ali, if only the CGI team had been up to his level.  Overall, good film, could have been great, but still worth a viewing.</p></body></html>

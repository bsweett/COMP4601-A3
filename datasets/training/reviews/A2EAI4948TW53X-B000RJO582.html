<meta name="summary" content="STOP COMPLAINING ALREADY!"></head><body><p>Get over it people, and get a life. This movie was awesome. So what if it is a remake of the original dawn? They are both awesome. Other than the mall core concept, this movie is totally different. So stop whining like a three year old girl with a stubbed toe and accept it. You are the same people crying about the new star wars movies. You need to get out more...<p>as far as the movie goes, i said it before, awesome! Does not IN ANY WAY dissapoint. The zombies are fast in this one (like 28 days later) and there are more people in the mall now. I won't spoil it for anyone. Lets pray they keep up the good work and remake day of the dead too.</p></body></html>

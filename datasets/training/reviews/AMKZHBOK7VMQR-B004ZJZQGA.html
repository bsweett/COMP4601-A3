The story of two oddly paired guys who are forced into hiding features the city of Bruges to great effect as a background. While Farrell's character is absolutely miserable at the prospect of being stuck there, his partner played by Brendan Gleeson is enthralled with the atmosphere of the place, repeatedly referring to it as a "fairy tale place."<br />Without giving too much away, they are pursued there by a venomous underworld character masterfully played by Ralph Fiennes. The dialogue is witty in a "pulp Fiction" sort of way, the action scenes are gripping and the setting is magnificent. Pretty solid entertainment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="IT'S NOT CITIZEN KANE, BUT IT'S STILL AN EXCELLENT FILM"></head><body><p>PLOT ELEMENTS IN A NUTSHELL: [contains spoilers]<br /><br />Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) is a hack, American pulp fiction writer, who arrives in Vienna just after the end of World War 2. Harry Lime (Orson Welles), his close friend, had promised him a job. Upon his arrival, Martins is shocked to learn that Lime has been killed in a traffic accident. In fact, Lime's funeral is taking place almost at that very moment. Martins meets the pleasant-enough-acting Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) and actress Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) who is weeping rather conspicuously at the eulogy taking place at the gravesite. There the Major informs Martins that his deceased friend, Harry Lime, was a "thief" and a "murderer". Martins is at first outraged, like any loyal friend would be. Gradually, however, through the course of his own personal investigation, he realizes that Calloway is correct. Even more shocking, Martins eventually concludes that the man lying in the coffin in the film's early scenes was not his friend Harry Lime. Lime is still alive and, in fact, appears to have been the mysterious "third man" at the scene of the fatal accident where he [Lime] supposedly died.<br /><br />NOW WASN'T THAT PLOT QUITE A MOUTHFUL?:<br /><br />All of the above is the set-up for what the film is ultimately all about. We wait through roughly 2/3 of the film to meet Orson Welles in this movie and the question must be "was it worth the wait?"<br /><br />ORSON WELLES IS, WELL, ORSON WELLES:<br /><br />In any and all scenes, it seems, Orson Welles steals the show. In this movie, it happens most apparently on the ferris wheel where he more or less lays things out for his friend, Holly Martins. "Why can't Welles be in the whole film?" one might be tempted to ask. Perhaps it would be too much of a good thing, like putting too much sugar in one's tea or too much ice cream in one's ice cream float. Anyway, the film needs more of Orson Welles, but probably can't do that without an Orson Welles overdose or a rest-of-the-film underdose. I'm not sure, but it just seemed like Orson Welles really unbalances the film. When he's on, HE'S THE MAN and when he's not, HE'S MISSING! Sort of like Brando in the Godfather or Welles himself in CITIZEN KANE. Aha! Now we are on to something! THE THIRD MAN IS NOT CITIZEN KANE AND IT'S NOT THE GODFATHER. That's right. This film is not a cinematic masterpiece. Many reviewers rate "The Third Man" as 5-star entertainment, but it just lacks the depth and meaning of either of the aforementioned movies.<br /><br />SEE THE THIRD MAN AS A HALF-FULL RATHER THAN HALF-EMPTY GLASS:<br /><br />I felt exactly the same way about "The Wild One" with Brando and "A Touch Of Evil" with Welles. After contemplating this for a while, I realized that "The Third Man" is actually a lot like "A Touch Of Evil" and that Welles has really spoiled me with his sensational performance from start to finish in the equally-sensational film "Citizen Kane". After accepting that, I can now appreciate "The Third Man" and see the film (as well as Welles' role in it) as a half-full rather than half-empty glass.<br /><br />WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT:<br /><br />There is, at the climax, a rather dramatic chase scene in the Viennese sewers. We are left with the feeling that Europeans have a certain distaste for the simplistic view we Americans have toward the issues and problems that they [foreign nations] must deal with and overcome. Holly Martins embodies this common American attitude in the film and we should see the Viennese reaction to his character as the reaction toward Americans in general during this period in history.<br /><br />SO WHO'S IN THIS FLICK?<br /><br />ACTORS:<br /><br />Joseph Cotten  - Holly Martins<br />Alida Valli  - Anna Schmidt<br />Orson Welles  - Harry Lime<br />Trevor Howard  - Maj.

To my taste, This film is a little unnecessarily dark, stark, and dank, but that is no reason not to see it. Orson Welles is, as always, a delight when he's in the scene and is sorely missing when he's not.<br /><br />IF YOU LIKED "THE THIRD MAN" ALSO CONSIDER SEEING:<br /><br />"A TOUCH OF EVIL", starring Orson Welles, "D.O.A.", starring Edmond O'Brien, "Asphalt Jungle", starring Sterling Hayden or "Kiss Me Deadly" starring Ralph Meeker.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />Terrific cleaned and remastered transfer which is typical of any Criterion DVD product.<br /><br />DVD Features:<br />Available Subtitles: English; Available Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono)<br /><br />Video introduction by writer-director Peter Bogdanovich<br />Abridged recording of Graham Greene's Third Man treatment<br />The alternate opening voice-over narration by Joseph Cotten from the U.S. version, Archival footage of composer Anton Karas and the film's famous sewer location.<br /><br />The Third Man on radio: The episode "A Ticket to Tangiers" from the 1951 broadcast of The Lives of Harry Lime series, written and performed by Orson Welles, and the complete Third Man broadcast from the same year of the Lux Radio Theater adaptation performed by Joseph Cotten.<br /><br />Audio interview excerpts with assistant director Guy Hamilton.</p></body></html>

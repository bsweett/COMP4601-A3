This movie is a crude, dumb, corny, not even remotely amusing paycheck for failed comedians (watch for Chevy Chase saying reading from the cue cards occasionally as the Magical Guy who Happens in the Pointless Plot near the Hot Tub!)<br /><br />And what a portrait of humanity.  Three losers (Nick being the worst of them--he's not convincing as "the wild man", and judging from his embarassing acting ability maybe that garage/suicide attempt wasn't such a bad idea) who are getting into their late thirties are pining for their teens (is it a coincidence that these guys grew up in the 1980's?) and go back to a low rent cottage where they originally partied hardy.  While seeing a Poison concert!<br /><br />There was maybe one laugh.  You know, I love nihilistic and crude humor when it's done with degree of subtlety, sophistication--maybe I should just come out and say talent??  I'm a smoker who wants to quit, and this gave me a setback.  Stupid, pedantic garbage.</p></body></html>

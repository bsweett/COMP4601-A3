<meta name="summary" content="TRY THE COMIC BOOKS FIRST TO UNDERSTAND"></head><body><p>As all comic book characters are well built, T. Jane fit in well and as a whole the movie did follow the style of comic book writing.<br /><br />As a gripping movie - it was ok. Not the best out - but will still find its way into my collection.  Comic books for nostalga, movies for more visual effects.  People for more realism.<br /><br />I will admit that I prefer Dolph Lundgren's version of Frank Castle but Louis Gossett Jr added depth to the story.<br /><br />It had enough blood and guts and explosions for the average person. Just do a little reading of the comics - you should enjoy them both.</p></body></html>

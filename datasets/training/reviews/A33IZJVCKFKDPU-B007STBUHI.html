<meta name="summary" content="HD Digital Copy!!!"></head><body><p>This review isn't about the movie itself. Everyone knows that Jaws is a classic. I just want to express how impressed I am with Universal. First of all, I like how they include a Digital Copy and an UltraViolet copy. It's gives everyone what they could possibly want. Plus when I downloaded my digital copy, the HD version also downloaded. This is the first time I've downloaded a digital copy that's include the HD version of the movie. I'm starting to stream more and it's a big plus to know that Universal's Blu Rays include an HD digital copy. Lastly, the Blu Ray transfer is really good. It's almost too good because the shark looks REALLY fake now lol.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Emperors"></head><body><p>"My goal is to dig from the ice a story which has never seen the light of day for want of a teller. A true story, however extraordinary. A story repeated every winter, as it has been for hundreds of thousands of years. But there has never been a generation of men to witness and shape it, to pass it down, for man has never colonized the Antarctic. The emperor penguin had never encountered man before the first polar explorers arrived barely a century ago. In 1950, when tentative, makeshift bases were established here, scientific observation had replaced legend as Man's preferred narrative." The impetus for this film is explained by the director, Luc Jacquet<br /><br />The Emperor penguin is an extraordinarily endearing creature, who despite being an animal occasionally has striking human qualities. We first meet the Emperors on their 70 mile trek to their breeding ground, full of food and fat in body. Day and night, 7 days these thousands of penguins march or waddle to meet their mates.  In the colossal cold of Antarctica, and with all of the dangers inherent, the penguins reach their destination. At this time, they meet their mates, they fall in love and an egg is hatched. It is then a 24 hour feat for the female to transfer the egg to male. It is the male's duty to shelter this egg for months from the cold and dangers. The females then devoid of nutrition make the 70 odd mile trek back to the waters to catch their food. They must eat enough to sustain them and then once again make the 70 mile trek back to the males. Meanwhile the eggs are hatching, 80% of the eggs fail. To see and hear the Emperor penguins cry and moan their loss of a baby is to bring tears to the eyes.  The mothers make it back; feed their babies, and then the fathers trek back to the ocean.<br /><br />The babies after one year, on one certain day, all of them, for the first time, dive into the ocean for their first swim. They stay there, in the ocean, for 4 years until it is their time to make the trek to mate.<br /><br />The filmmaking is extraordinary, the music superb, and the voice of the narrator, Morgan Freeman, has turned this film into one of the most superb works of art.  I see the Emperor Penguins marching, day after day in the supreme cold, full of danger all along the way, mate and meet their babies.  A tale so wonderful to behold that not enough superlatives in our language can express my wonderment.<br />Highly Recommended. prisrob</p></body></html>

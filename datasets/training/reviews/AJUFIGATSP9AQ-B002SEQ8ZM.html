Shot like a live action film and powerful as a visual and aural experience. Through the looking glass concept fresh and engrossing. Perfect for adults of all ages. It's amazing that 'stop-action' continues in this digital world but the two work together for this sublimely creepy and fun film. 3-D is great for home format. 2-D is like 3-D. BD is awesome A/V. Dig copy has DVD and 3-D. 8 Glasses. You might not think you want it; I didn't and flipped when I experienced it. Good work.</p></body></html>

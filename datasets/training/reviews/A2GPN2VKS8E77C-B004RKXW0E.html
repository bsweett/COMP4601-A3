Disney & Pixar have crafted another wonderful movie with positive messages, and this one is a fitting conclusion to the Toy Story saga.<br /><br />Biblically speaking, there is nothing offensive. There are a few scenes that may be intense for those under eight years of age, but nothing over the top ("The Wizard Of Oz" and other G-rated films contain scary scenes, but nothing worthy of a higher rating). It earned the G rating, and deserves the Oscars for Best Animated Film and Best Picture that it's been nominated for (the Academy Awards will be in February). I caught myself about to cry during one scene (for fear of revealing a major plot point, I can't and won't say which scene it was). Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and the rest of the cast (minus Jim Varney) return, along with all-new voice casting, which includes the original Batman (Michael Keaton) and my favourite James Bond (Timothy Dalton). I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Have some tissues handy, because you'll need them. (I do wish Mr. Pricklepants' role had been bigger, though). Keep watching through the credits.<br /><br />Though the end of the film subtly implies that this is the final installment in the Toy Story franchise, I sincerely hope it isn't. For all three motion pictures, the writing, voice casting, animation and all the other production values have been top-notch, as you would expect from Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar.<br /><br />Now that I think of it, there are parallels between this film and the Christian life. SPOILER ALERT. For instance, a toy echoes a non-biblical worldview (something like "We can become the masters of our own destiny"), but it's clearly shown where that train of thought leads them. SPOILER ALERT OVER.</p></body></html>

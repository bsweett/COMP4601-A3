Not great, . . . but not bad."></head><body><p>I remember when the "Fantastic Four" comic books first appeared in the early `60s and how I enjoyed the breath of fresh air they brought to the genre. Basing a live-action film on a comic book is something else, though, and the attempt is often winceingly unsuccessful. (The "X-Men" movie was pretty bad, in my view.) This one isn't too bad, mostly because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Ioan Gruffiudd is pretty good as the nerdy Reed Richards and Jessica Alba is okay as Sue Storm. The show is stolen by the other two members of the team, though -- Chris Evans as the smart-mouthed, narcissistic Johnny Storm, and Michael Chiklis as the anguished Ben Grimm, "The Thing." On many levels, of course, it's just another cliched superhero movie, but the writers didn't forgo plot and character development in favor of mindless "action."</p></body></html>

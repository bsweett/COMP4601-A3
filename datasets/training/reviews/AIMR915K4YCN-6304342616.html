Having grown up on awesome stuff like WAR OF THE WORLDS, EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, STAR WARS, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, etc., I was grateful to Roland Emmerich for making this homage to all things sci-fi (c. 1950-1981)! Is ID4 heavy on cgi fx? Yes. Is there a series of unbelievable plot contrivances? You bet. Are the heroes too heroic? Yep. Still, it is the perfect tribute to an era of science fiction that I grew up watching. For that, I love it...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What happened?"></head><body><p>I told myself the American people have spoken and they have agreed this was the funniest movie of the year.  Some say of all time.<br /><br />I think going into it thinking it was going to be funny spoiled it for us.  If it had just been advertised as an action film or a mystery film we would have enjoyed it more.  It is rather like a mystery: you all know the basic set-up how three of the guys wake up hungover in a trashed luxury suite at Caesar's Palace with various odd things in place that shouldn't have been there (baby, tiger, chicken), and things are missing (Ed Helms' front tooth, the groom), and the plot is trying to figure out not "what's wrong with this picture" but basically how to make it right again.  I kept hoping that the groom would be dead, and that one of the groomsmen would snap to and remember he had killed him.  But that is partially because I dislike the actor Justin Bartha, I'm not saying the story would have been better.<br /><br />Yet in a way the movie was sort of like CRAZY HEART turned inside out.  CRAZY HEART had the same sort of basic plot (except it was just one guy waking up from a massive hangover that had lasted his whole life) attempting to mend things by going to AA and making amends to the child he has nearly lost.<br /><br />This story was more elaborate and had a few more laughs, but I have to say, Ed Helms is better in The Office, Bradley Cooper was better in Alias, and Zach G much better in Bored to Death on HBO.  As for Heather Graham, well, the movie doesn't seem to have done much for her career (while people laughed at Lindsay Lohan for turning it down), but maybe it's because Heather G. looks so strange here: oh, the miseries of bad plastic surgeons and playing a stripper slash escort while breastfeeding.  And yet, lots of people love the movie, maybe I'll watch it a second time, in Hell.</p></body></html>

Howard Hawks remade it in a fashion, and actually improved upon it by putting his distinct spin on it, in To Have and Have Not. While it often gets overpraised because it is a beloved favorite of critics, it also doesen't receive the credit due it. The four strongest performances here, namely Bogart, Rains, Lorre, and Joy Page, who rarely even gets a mention, didn't garner the Academy Award. It can be argued that any solid studio director from this period could have made a great film out of the terrific screenplay worked on by many but credited to Howard Koch and Julius and Philip Epstein, and the fine cast assembled. But it is a film which is more than the sum of its parts, and the reason why it has been copied so often over the years.<br /><br />Bogart is Rick Blaine, doing okay running Rick's Cafe Americain in Casablanca, in French Morocco. Everyone must go through Casablanca to get to Lisbon, and freedom from the turmoil brought about by Hitler's ever growing expansion. Rick runs his cafe and gambling house unencumbered by politics, looking out only for himself and a few close and loyal employees like Sam (Dooley Wilson) and Carl (S.Z. Sakall). Peter Lorre is marvelous as the criminal who worships Rick, and seeks his approval. It is really what happens to Ugarte (Lorre) which turns Rick against the Nazi's and for the French Resistance, though it won't become evident until the film is nearly over. It is perhaps, the most interesting relationship in the film, made more so since Lorre meets his end early on.<br /><br />Ugarte leaves Rick a letter of transit which can't even be questioned, when in pops Rick's reason for hiding out in Casablanca; Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman). Rick's bitter disillusionment with love all goes back to what happened in Paris, where Ilsa left him holding his heart in his hand. The montages were in part directed by Don Siegel, who would direct Mitchum and Greer in The Big Steal, and later become well known for Dirty Harry with Clint Eastwood. Ilsa isn't alone, however, bringing with her her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). He is the lead figure behind the movement to rid the French of the Third Reich. They would prefer he never make it to Lisbon. Caught in between is the pragmatic Captain Renault (Claude Rains). He gives a terrific performance, full of humor and larceny. It is never clear which side he is on. Ilsa wants her husband Victor to escape with his life but Rick isn't so ready to hand over those transit papers; not without some graveling and an explanation for the way he was burned by her.<br /><br />Perhaps Bergman was a good second choice for Ilsa after all. The viewer knows she's messed Rick up, and wants it to be righted, while at the same time sensing they don't belong together. Her casting and lack of chemistry with Bogart makes the ending easier to take for me. Before we get there, however, there are some terrific moments from Joy Page as a young wife fleeing Bulgaria and desperate to get she and her husband out of Casablanca. What Rick does to help her out, and get around her making a mistake with Renault, shows the effect Ugarte's killing by the Germans had on him. Rick is at heart a softhearted romantic, which is why he was cut so deeply by Ilsa's getting over on him in Paris. There was a reason, however, and once he knows what it is, he'll come to the same decision the viewer has.<br /><br />Casablanca won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Screenplay, and Direction (Michael Curtiz). Bogart would have won for Best Actor, Rains for Supporting Actor, and Joy Page for Best Supporting Actress in a different time and place. While this isn't the Noir masterpiece many describe it as, it is one amazingly smooth blend of genres which pleases everyone, and makes it one of the great films of all-time. Silent film fans might even catch a glimpse of star Monte Blue as an uncredited American. Bogart and Bergman fans can enjoy watching this over and over, as it is one of those films almost universally cherished by movie lovers.</p></body></html>

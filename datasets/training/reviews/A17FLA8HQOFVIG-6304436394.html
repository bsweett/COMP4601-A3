<meta name="summary" content="Fast paced violent film with silly plot. I liked it."></head><body><p>Three  years after Robert Rodriguez came along and showed the world how a mere $7,000 and a lot of creativity could make a successful film called El Mariachi, he made Desperado.  This 1995 film has a bigger budget and more star quality, but the imprint of this director is certainly there.  There's lots of violence - with guns, knives and explosives.  And, like El Mariachi, the characterizations are secondary to the constant action.  It's all very silly, and a little too long at 106 minutes, but I frankly couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  <p> <p>The film stars Antonio Bandaras as the good guy and Salma Hayek as his romantic interest.  There's a cameo performance by Quentin Tarantino and Steve Buscemi has one of the best scenes in the film as he sets up the story at the beginning by his tall tale in a bar.  <p> <p>This is not a film to be taken seriously.  It's targeted to teenage boys and the video game crowd.<p> <p>So why am I watching this flick and enjoying myself so much?  I guess it's cause I'm just a film buff and am fascinated by the techniques and constant action.  And best of all I loved the extra feature, which shows how one of the scenes was filmed.  It's not for everyone, of course.  But I liked it.</p></body></html>

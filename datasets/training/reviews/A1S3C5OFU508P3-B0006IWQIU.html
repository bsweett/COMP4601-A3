<meta name="summary" content="The melding of the "Predator" and "Alien" storylines was a product of genius"></head><body><p>For years, "Aliens" has been my favorite movie, not only due to the tense action, but also due to the power and likelihood of the adversary. It is my strongly held opinion that when humans encounter an alien animal species for the first time, it will be a hive-based species rather than humanoid. Insects are far more efficient, prolific, resilient and relentless in their pursuit of survival.<br /> I consider the adversary created for the Alien line of movies to be the product of genius. It is terrifying to look at, extremely powerful, deadly, prolific, and intelligent. The melding of the Alien creature with the Predator creature in the same movie is also the product of genius. A space-faring species that never lost their roots of the ritual hunt would find the Alien creature one of the most formidable opponents, so it is natural that they would reserve an otherwise useless planet as a hunting ground.<br /> This movie combines the tense action of the Predator with the ruthlessness of the Alien and there is a three-way battle with humans largely in the way. It takes some time to develop the complete background, but once it does, you are on the edge of your seat anticipating the next event. In a classic, "The enemy of my enemy is my friend" situation an unusual alliance is formed for survival.<br /> This is a great movie, it rivals "Aliens" in terms of action and the intelligent extrapolation of alien species and ends with what could be the first event in a climactic battle for the survival of a species.</p></body></html>

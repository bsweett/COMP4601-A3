This is a good film for a family to watch together, but anyone looking for something edgy or new will be disappointed.  A talented cast is mostly wasted with a sub par script about 4 buddies unhappy with portions of their life decide to ride their motorcycles across country for a week.  Along the way they run afoul of a nasty motorcycle gang and have to save a town from being ravaged.  Ray Liotta is okay as the gang leader, though I think some of his underlings are much funnier.  An extra star for the surprise cameo at the end.  This is a rental for me.</p></body></html>

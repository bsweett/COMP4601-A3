I'd rather read reviews on how a film such as this affected the reviewer while and/or after they viewed it.<br />So fellow film fans this is what I think of "Pan's Labyrinth" after viewing it yesterday afternoon at a somewhat crowded 1pm sunday matinee. First off you could've heard a pin drop throughout(or maybe those were movie patrons chin bones hitting the floor?)anyway I had been waiting to see this film for a little over a year now ever since I first read a small article on it in Fangoria. I didn't know much about it(nor did I want too) all I knew was that one of my very favorite Director's in Guillermo del Toro was the meastro behind it,it had fantasy elements to it and that it had been getting alot of praise from critics throughout the film festival circuit. Now that I have finally seen the film it has by far surpassed my expectations wich were already of the highest standards. This film is an extraorinary work of cinema story telling art. It is truly a perfect balance of Drama,horror and philosophical depth. Guillermo del Toro not only masterfully makes a nightmarish reality run paralel with a colorfully dark yet truly hopeful fantasy world but he somehow manages to intertwine them in a way as to leave the individual viewer to take away from it whatever they may & for me that's finding  true limitless hope in the core of magic amidst a world of brutal reality(as we know it) that seem's to have lost both. This is a timeless film that is so complete in every sense of the word that in the end may very well stand head and shoulder's above all philosophical fantasy movies from 'The Wizard Of OZ' until now.<br />I'm shocked that it has limited play in theatres,but then again when I look at the lost world that surrounds me I guess I'm not so shocked,wich gives this movie that much more meaning(for me).<br />I know that saying this may affect my credibility as an armcheer movie critic(lol!) but I'm willing to take that chance and go out on a limb and say that to date this is not only one my personal favorite movies but with all it's film making elements perfectly placed & balanced just right it may very well be technically the greatest film ever made!</p></body></html>

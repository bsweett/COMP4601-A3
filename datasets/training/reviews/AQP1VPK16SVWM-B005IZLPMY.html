<meta name="summary" content="Nearly perfect comic hero origin story minus irony becomes a terrific retro experience"></head><body><p>While Captain America (Chris Evans) and his origin have had screen time before it's no mean feat to bring off TWO origins stories in one film (a period film no less), make it a fun adventure AND set up a big screen sequel with what amounts to a satisfying ending all in a little over two hours.<br /><br />Joe Johnston's experience with previous franchise films ("Jurassic Park III") and retro superhero stories (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JZBP4Q">The Rocketeer: 20th Anniversary Edition [Blu-ray</a>]) boded well for "Captain America: The First Avenger". Set during World War II (as was Cap's origin story)and featuring his greatest nemesis from the time (The Red Skull expertly played by Hugo Weaving). Of all the superhero movies this past summer only "Captain America: The First Avenger" delievered on all fronts. The main flaw of the movie is that the origin story as essential as it is seems to go on a bit too long but, in some respects, that also allows us to identify even more with Rogers as we share his frustration every step of the way. Unfortunately that also leaves LESS story for us to see Cap in action.<br /><br />Originally presented in 3D in theaters "Captain America: The First Avenger" looks marvelous with a simply stunning Blu-ray transfer--colors are bold in a retro sort of way and the detail is amazing from the crisp, sharp images to the 7.1 lossless Surround mix.<br /><br />Special features include a feature commentary with director Johnston surrounded by DP Shelly Johnson and Editor Jeffrey Ford. Their discussion focuses primarily on the technical aspect and while there are large sections of silence, they don't babble away like many folks do on commentary tracks.<br /><br />We also get six featurettes on the creation of the film that covers everything from costuming, adapting the comic and the characters of Rogers and the Red Skull. Also included is a featurette on the transformation of Rogers from whimp to action hero. We also get an opportunity to hear from co-creator Joe Simon (who wrote "Captain America" while the great artist Jack Kirby did the artwork and helped plot the comic as well)on the origin of Cap. The special features are rounded off by two theatrical trailers for the film and a short "Marvel One-Shot: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way To Thor's Hammer" that follows Agent Colson as he makes his way to the site where Thor's hammer falls in the film "Thor".<br /><br />Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants to enlist in the good fight against the Nazi's during World War II but he's a 96 pound weakling; Roger is left behind while his pals including "Bucky" Barnes ship off to fight in Europe, he's left behind feeling like even more of a loser. Rogers can't pass the physical until Dr. Abraham Erskin (Stanley Tucci)takes an interest in Rogers and signs him up for his super solider experiment. Once injected with Erksin's powerful formula Rogers transforms into everything that Erskin could have hoped for the only problem is that Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones perfectly cast)sees Rogers as little more than a promotional tool once it becomes clear he won't get any more super soldiers and sees his best possible soldier as too big an asset to gamble on in battle. Ultimately, though, it's only Captain America as he comes to be known while out promoting war bonds that can fight the mutant result of another of Erskin's experiments the Red Skull.<br /><br />Although the film focuses a bit too much on Cap before he gets out there to fight the Red Skull, "Captain America: The First Avenger" delivers on the promise made early with Marvel films such as "Iron Man" and is the best of the batch after that film with a strong retro look, great action sequences and some truly stunning set pieces. The film also provides the perfect set up for next summer's action superhero epic Josh Whedon's "The Avengers" and we get a brief peak at that film at the conclusion of this film after the credits.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

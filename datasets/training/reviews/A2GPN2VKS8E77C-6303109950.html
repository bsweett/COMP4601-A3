<meta name="summary" content="A Great Historical Drama/Action Film With A Star-Studded Cast.  Recommended For History Classes."></head><body><p>In 1993, George P. Cosmatos (the "Rambo" films) made an epic historical drama action remake (if you wish to call it such) of the classic film "Gunfight At The O.K. Corral." Although the translations for the Latin used by Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn,<br /><br />"The Terminator," "Terminator 2" [Special Edition], "Megiddo") and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer, "The Saint," "Batman Forever,"<br /><br />"The Prince Of Egypt") appear in the "Trivia" section, I still<br /><br />think that Cosmatos should have placed English subtitles for those phrases in the movie. Worth viewing, not only for the historical value of the film, but because of the star-studded cast, which includes the real Wyatt Earp's fifth cousin, also named Wyatt Earp, Kurt Russell ("Sky High"), Sam Elliott ("HULK"), Bill Paxton ("The Terminator," "Twister," "Titanic") Billy Zane ("Back To The Future," "Back To The Future Part II,"<br /><br />"The Phantom," "Titanic," the made-for-TV remake of "CLEOPATRA,"<br /><br />"Sniper," the TV mini-series "Sole Survivor," "Posse," "Tales From The Crypt Presents DEMON KNIGHT"), Billy Bob Thornton ("The Alamo," the recent remake of "The Bad News Bears," "Bad Santa,"<br /><br />"Pushing Tin," "Armageddon"), Stephen Lang ("Gods And Generals,"<br /><br />"Gettysburg"), Powers Boothe (the TV mini-series "Joan Of Arc"), Thomas Haden Church (the "George Of The Jungle" movies, the upcoming "Spider-Man 3" [set for release next summer]), Robert Mitchum ("The Longest Day," "Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison," "River Of No Return," "The Wild Bunch") as the Narrator and Academy Award winner Charlton Heston ("The Ten Commandments," "Ben-Hur" [Academy Award, 1959], "Planet Of The Apes," "Soylent Green,"<br /><br />"William Shakespeare's Hamlet") as Henry Hooker. Too violent for young children, but older kids and adults will enjoy this excellent history lesson. Rated PG-13 for violence and brief strong language.</p></body></html>

Least of all the movie's. Yes, there are a few scenes that might make the squeamish cringe, but the gore factor here is surprisingly low; I'm half-convinced the movie has the rating it does because of the language rather than the violence.<br /><br />Based on the true story of Ivan Milat, a serial killer who was relatively unknown outside Australia previous to the making of this movie, Wolf Creek follows three kids--Ben (Nathan Phillips of Snakes on a Plane), Kristy (Darkness Falls' Kestie Morassi), and Liz (TV actress Cassandra Magrath)--as they head out to Wolf Creek, a large meteorite crater in the Australian outback, and go hiking. When they get back to their car, they find it dead. A few hours later, a friendly chap named Mick (Picnic at Hanging Rock's John Jarratt) offers to tow them back to his camp and get their car running. That's not what he has in mind, as you know if you've seen any of the trailers.<br /><br />The acting, with the exception of Jarrett (who has been much-lauded for his efforts), is average, maybe slightly above. The cinematography is wonderful, which you can pretty much automatically expect from any movie that comes from that neck of the woods; there's just something about Australian cinematographers. The pace is, as with most horror movies since, modeled upon that of Alien--do nothing for a long time, and then cut everything loose. It's getting kind of old, to be honest. And that's the movie's biggest problem; it cleaves tightly to horror film convention for being an indie flick. Happy beginning, ominous stories at night, false alarm, car breakdown, scary serial killer. Woo. It's done with some style, to be sure, but it's nothing you haven't seen before. ***</p></body></html>

The three movies that nearly single-handedly made Michael J. Fox into a star are here for purchase.<br /><br />These three DVD contain an amazement of extras, including commentary on all three features, deleted scenes for the movies, the interviews, featurettes, documetaries, an assortment of others.  A definite must have for film fans of all ages.<br /><br />One of the most universally loved movies to ever grace the cinema. The movies look flawless.  The prints are amazing, everything looks amazing.  It's just an amazing experience.  Presented in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen, it's a beauty to the eyes, and the 5.1 soundtrack is a beauty ot the ears as well.<br /><br />This is a definite must have.  Good family fun for everyone, and if you've seen the movies a hundred times over, check out the discs for the boatload of extras.  You won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

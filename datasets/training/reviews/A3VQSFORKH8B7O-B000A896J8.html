While slow in it's buildup, the film features exciting battle sequences, amazing visual effects, and (Most important of all) great performances by a stellar cast. And it's fair depiction of both Christian and Muslim alike lends to it a cautionary tale about how we need to get along despite are differences, and that fanatics of all religions are dangerous people who need to be dealt with.<br /><br />The Widescreen DVD release features impressive sound-and-picture quality. The main extra, the production grid, features nine featurettes that, although very well-done, are not as good as the seven-part documentary for the Extended DVD of "Gladiator." Even better are the "Movie Real" documentary that presents the truth behind the movie, and the "History vs. Hollywood" documentary that details both the fact and fiction behind this amazing film. The four internet featurettes and theatrical trailer are good as well.<br /><br />"Kingdom of Heaven" is a fantastic film that belongs in everyone's collection of historical epics.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A-</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MEET A REAL HERO"></head><body><p>Every now and then a movie comes along whose subject matter is so important that the art of the film is almost irrelevant.<br /><br />The universally praised HOTEL RWANDA (MGM) is ordinary filmmaking about an extraordinary man.  Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is the manager of an elite hotel who exhibits the highest, most noble of human traits when he bravely takes a stand against the barbaric, bloody savagery during the 1994 Hutu massacre of the Tutsi minority.  Almost all the Tutsis were eventually slaughtered (by machete).<br /><br />When his country descends into chaos, Rusesabagina first wants to save his family, assuming the world will intervene.  When that doesn't happen, he opens his hotel to over a thousand refugees. When a crazed militia storms the gates of the Hotel compound, the  stakes are substantially raised for his, his family's and "guests" safety.<br /><br />Cheadle is magnificent as the clever, calm, quick thinking, heroic but never larger-than-life Rusesabagina.  Sophie Okoneda and Nick Nolte co-star in this unforgettable film.  Don't miss this rare true story about an honorable man trapped in a living nightmare of raging humanity at its most abhorrent, brutal, irrational and bestial level.<br /><br />If you are reluctant to see this excellent film, fearing graphic depiction of the bloody events, fear not; almost all of it is off screen.  Superior extras include "Return to Rwanda" and a commentary with the real life Paul Rusesabagina</p></body></html>

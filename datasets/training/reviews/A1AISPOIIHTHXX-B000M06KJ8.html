A lot of what she does is more based on atmosphere and a serene landscape rather than being super realistic and narrative driven. It's probably because of this that the film wasn't that well received at Cannes or with most of the critics. While it's true that the film is potentially polarizing, you got to admit it's nice now and then to watch a film that actually cares about how it looks and what kind of emotions it brings out. It's like a film by Terrence Malick if he ever learned to quit pointing the camera at stuff every 20 seconds.<br /><br />Marie Antoinette was an Austrian member of royalty who was shipped off to France to marry Louis the XVI and provide an heir. Inexplicably Louis doesn't seem that interested in bedding the beautiful girl which is only one of many problems since she lives in a world where etiquette and protocol are the most important things. At first it's a little minor: she can't dress herself but has to wait for people to do it for her and manners in addressing the King's mistress. But pretty soon things get to her head and she gets into rockstar mode and spends a lot and parties which doesn't sit well at all with the people of France.<br /><br />If you're looking for a history lesson, read a book. You'll basically get the personal life and intimate details of who she was rather than getting caught up in dates and facts. There's points where you can't tell how much time has passed and have to gauge the film's timeline based on things around her such as the age of her first daughter or dialogue mentioned. But she was likely one of France's most hated queens and rampant rumors spread in France concerning her personal life, such as alleged lesbianism and sodomy. This is a look at a life who never seemed to make a right decision in people's eyes and it's a fascinating look at someone thought to be unbelievably reviled.<br /><br />One of the more controversial things about the film is the use of a more comtemporary soundtrack, with songs from artists like the Strokes, the Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Sometimes, such as the case of the Cure's majestic chording in "Plainsong" announcing Louis XVI becoming the next King of France and at times there's almost a rock backing with drums and guitar and it works great but then you have the opening credits set to a punk song and the Strokes on here, it just sounds a bit misguided. Certain ideas like the Cure work but other ones didn't work at all and it's a bit of a fumble.<br /><br />While music-wise it's a little iffy, this is certainly a dreamy kind of film. From the immaculate set design and costuming to the cinematography whenever they actually go outside which is very little is quite stunning. That's one of the things I always liked about this Coppola's movies is that she does know how to frame and point a camera but one brief scene in a garden Marie Antoinette had made had too much of a Virgin Suicides look to it. But regardless this is certainly Sofia's most ambitious looking film and thankfully it delivers. The pacing might throw people, the modern soundtrack might be too distracting but you gotta admit it's a lush looking film.<br /><br />On one hand, I'm disappointing by the lack of features but since Virgin Suicides or Lost in Translation weren't that packed, I guess it's a director thing. But if you're a fan of this film, and be warned that not everyone will; it's serviceable for a film that'll confuse for some and seduce others.</p></body></html>

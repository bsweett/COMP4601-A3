<meta name="summary" content="one of my favorite comic book movie ever!"></head><body><p>thats right!ghost rider passed up my previous favorite x-men 3.its my favorite movie of the whole year!of course the ghost rider story spans millenia,so in order to do it justice youd need about 5 or 6 parts.also,marvel is horrible about putting fitting ppl in roles as their super heros.i dont know how a motorcycle madman johnny blaze gets portrayed by a wanna be action guy  like cage.all they needed was a grungy looking biker with a hellfire gun and boom you got johnny blaze.cage is more fit for roles like 1970s john travolta."stayin alive stayin alive whoo hoo hhooo hooo".the ghost rider himself though was very cool indeed.i was suprised how accurately his powers and weopons were displayed.the only other real thing about the movie is it spans thousands of years of story telling in one movie.SOME YAHOO CALLED ME THE WORST REVIEWER EVER!so i will state my sources.<br />  theres carter slade the cowboy ghost rider[not only was he in the movie itself.he is mentioned in wikipedia.com.i also own the comic book he first appears in.]<br />  the ww1 ghost rider[he is also mentioned on wikipedia.com].<br />  ,noble kane,johnny blaze[this is the first biker type ghost rider.wikipedia.com.he is also the star of 2 comic book series.the one from the 70s that yes i own and a far more recent one.i own some of them also.not to mention that he was in marvel spotlight for a while and was the character in the movie]<br />  ,danny ketch[danny kecth released the spirit from a gem.he was the ghost rider in the 90s.i own those too].<br />  ,vengeance,[vengeance is a spirit of vengeance also.he is in the spirit of vengeance comic books as well as the 1990s ghost rider series with danny ketch]<br />  zarothos[a demon who has a flaming head also and makes trouble for ghost rider<br />  there is even a tech ghost rider from the futre in a comic book series.<br />  so there ARE all kinds of ghost riders.and i think it would be totaly cool to own a set of  movies about them all.the action is fantastic and the story line is pretty good while rushed.but since ghost rider is my all time favorite comic book guy,i totaly loved this movie.<br />  something parents should know is this guy is a demon from hell,yes,but one who is rebelling against the devil,for the cause of good and justice..so its your call!<br />  now about that above mentioned yahoo.i know you sit there in your moms basement all lonely and pathetic.you are balding.you are morbidly obese.you are wearing a xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx sized shirt that looks like a sports bra on you.oh! now it makes sense why you said i was the worst reviewer ever.because your idol is comic book guy from the simpsons.but i got something to say to you now.you couldnt get a hooker horny and the only way you will ever get any is if you get taken advantage of by a beached whale.</p></body></html>

Collecting some of the biggest names on screen, Lee has put together a film that has both the thrills and twists to entertain, and the comments on society to give something more when the credits have rolled by.<br /><br />Set in New York, the viewer enters the world of Dalton Russell, a bank robber with a so-called "perfect plan", and Detective Keith Frazier, who arrives to negotiate with the team of robbers. Add in the sub-plots of Arthur Case, who has a lot to lose in this robbery, and Madeleine White, a type of "discrete" agent with some less than legal influence, and you have a complex story line that gives you enough to think about to cope with a couple of viewings.<br /><br />The names filling the credits are impressive, making the movie all the more enjoyable. Jodie Foster, (White), Denzel Washington, (Frazier), Clive Owen, (Russell, a surprisingly good bad guy!), Christopher Plummer, (Case, and Willem Dafoe all make this movie special in their own ways. They are all top grade actors with the skills to make the story live.<br /><br />The social commentary is present all through the film at varying levels. For the most part, it is a subtle presence in the background, hardly making itself felt, but there none-the-less. At other moments, it is much more obvious. My own favourite scene is one betweem Dalton Russell and Brian, the young boy with his Playstation Portable and the violent games. Dalton asks about the game in which one has to do things such as kill and destroy people, (extremely graphically). Russell promises to have a word with Brian's father about the game. The entire movie is saturated with a social commentary on the corruption and violence that surrounds us, and a whole lot more.<br /><br />This is one of the best films I have seen recently and is a movie that has given me lots to think about and consider. It is powerful in its twists, well-acted and very well executed in all aspects. It is thoroughly enjoyable on a number of different levels. A great movie!</p></body></html>

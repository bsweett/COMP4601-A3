This really is a work of art from start to finish and has now been moved to the top of my list of movies to own and cherish forever. Since its release it has won numerous awards and has 9 Academy award nominations which they will undoubtedly win come the ceremony in March. The cast comprises of unknowns, but are ones with very familiar faces as, after doing a bit of research, a few of the actors have had very minor roles in other TV shows and movies so if this will be their leap to the big time, then it's well deserved.<br /><br />During the early stages of the Iraq war in 2004, this film follows a 3 member EOD (Explosives Ordinance Disposal) unit as they go about their missions in providing cover for one member, Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) while he disarms IED's (Improvised Explosive Devices. James' behaviour in rushing into the blast radius without sending in the bomb disposal robot first leads to him being labelled reckless by his fellow officers, Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). This image of a reckless officer has a negative effect on the team dynamic and as the film progresses you become more and more aware of the individual reasons why each character is the way he is.<br /><br />This film doesn't really follow a plot in the sense of that the team must solve some form of deep seeded puzzle, or there is a mastermind behind the bombs that this unit specifically dealt with. It simply follows a trio of officers as they do the same job which is being done for real in Iraq and touches upon how those officers deal with the situations in which they find themselves. The director, Kathryn Bigelow, wanted the film to immerse the viewer into something that was "Raw, immediate and Visceral". That it certainly achieved perfectly as although some of the scenes may seem slow, they're slow for a purpose. It wants you to be aware that anything can change at any time and although there may be a slight stint of calm and silence, that can change in an instant and it was brilliantly done.<br /><br />Although some of the actors may be better known than others, I'm happy in a way that it isn't a cast of megastars playing these roles. In a movie like this, if you had a cast that consisted of the likes of Brad Pitt, Matt Damon or Tom Cruise, for example, then the film simply wouldn't have the same impact. You would watch it for another purpose, rather than simply watching it for the story and that is why there appears to be this revolution of sorts with more and more of the most critically successful films containing unknown or little known actors rather than the big names. The film was shot in both Jordan and Kuwait and had a really authentic look and feel to it and the film is overall well deserving of any praise which it receives.<br /><br />However, there is one gripe I have about this film and it is one which was touched upon by other reviewers who unfairly gave it 1 star just due to this point alone. The way in which British servicemen were portrayed around the middle of the film was terribly offensive and overly typical to the point I had expected it to happen at some point during the film before even switching it on. There have been mountains of films that have done this and this will not be the last to make such a mistake, on the other side of the argument though, you would almost expect an English film to do the same thing to the Americans regardless of how serious the film is supposed to be. Although I did find this slightly offensive, I didn't let this damage my view of the film as a whole which I still support as being sublime.<br /><br />Shockingly brilliant and although it let me down in one particular scene, the film overall was superb. On Blu-Ray this film is especially done justice as the detail and resolution just makes it visually superb in its own right. Buy it, rent it or watch it at a friend's house. This is definitely a film to see.</p></body></html>

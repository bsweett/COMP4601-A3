<meta name="summary" content="More than a survival movie."></head><body><p>Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a modern day Robinson Crusoe.  It's far from it!  Survival is only a small part of the story of Chuck Noland, who ends up on a deserted island in the Pacific after a plane crash.  There's a great deal of things that make this movie a success.  Notably, there are lots of special effects and some very clever filming and computer work.  As a result, you really feel as if you are on the spot - on the plane as it goes down, on the raft as it bobs in the waves, on the island alone.  It's the realism that's led to the PG-13 rating, and not offensive content.  Admittedly there are a few items of content that are morally questionable, such as a few incidents of blasphemy, a crude sexual joke, and the contemplation of suicide.  Initially Chuck and Kelly live together while unmarried, and though-out his stay on the island there's a real absence of religious faith as fatalism replaces providence (while burying a crash victim, Chuck concludes an "empty" ceremony with the words "So.  That's it.")  But on the whole this movie is morally inoffensive, and its PG-13 rating is mainly due to frightening scenes, such as the airplane crash and later a floating dead body, and several injuries including the scraping of skin on coral, a splinter in his hand, and the removal of a tooth.  But even these scenes are more frightening because of the emotional sense of pain than graphic images.  Clever manipulation of sights and sounds are used to create a real sense of fear and suspense, and even the simple dropping of coconuts on the sand becomes frightening. Hitchcock would have been proud.<p>But even more than the special effects, it is especially the emotional conclusion combined with some stellar acting that made this movie. The survival story is framed by the story of Chuck's life in America.  As a result, the movie is like a play with three Acts.  Act 1 introduces us to Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx systems engineer whose professional life is ruled by the clock.  "We live and we die by time.  Let us not commit the sin of turning our back on time."  His personal life, including his relationship with girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) is dominated by time, and it is exactly for this reason that Chuck ends up on the doomed plane which crashes into the Pacific in a storm.<p>Acts 2 shows Chuck cast away on the island.  The clock, as it were, has stopped.  His survival experiences were based on the research and actual experiences of the screenwriter, and are depicted with a great deal of realism (Hanks made his contribution by losing a lot of weight and growing a delightful beard).  The island is no utopian tropical paradise, and consequently Chuck doesn't succeed with everything right away.  As he seeks to obtain the basic elements needed for human survival - food, water, shelter, fire, and companionship - there are memorable moments of triumph and tragedy, including his frustrations in getting coconut milk, his exuberance in starting a fire, and his primitive dentistry skills.  There is little dialogue, but a few floating FedEx packages supply him with "Wilson" the volleyball, who becomes his companion.  It's somewhat corny, but Wilson becomes a device for Chuck to express his thoughts and hold imaginary conversations.  Time has stopped on the timepiece Kelly gave him, but it is her photo on the clock that inspires Chuck to stay alive.<p>Act 3 brings Chuck back to civilization after some five years of survival on the island.  His Rip Van Winkel type return from the dead in my mind is the highlight of the movie, and results in emotional and moral dilemmas of tremendous power.  As his colleague says: "Tomorrow we're going to bring you back to life."  But coming back to life isn't so easy when you return to a world after five years where time hasn't stopped.  If surviving as a castaway on an island was difficult, Chuck discovers that it's just as difficult to be alive in the changed world to which he has returned.  Back at home, he's still a castaway.  Just as on the island, where "I stayed alive.  I kept breathing", so now he must keep breathing, waiting to see what the tide will bring.  A magnificent story-line combined with some tremendous acting from both Hanks and Hunt results in a powerful sense of loss.  I was grateful that the story didn't degenerate into a feel-good type ending with an immoral tryst, but actually suggested faithfulness to the institution of marriage (a departure from Chuck and Kelly's initial live-in relationship).  The ending is tough, but realistic, emotional, and powerful, and I was left thinking about it for a long long time.  There is a note of hope in the end, but it is not shoved down your throat, with Chuck left at the cross-roads of decision: "Where are you headed?  Well, I was just about to figure that out."  If there is a criticism, it would perhaps be that we don't get to spend as much time with the changed Chuck in Act 3 as we would like -  he has a new perspective on life, and we would learn something if we saw this new perspective put into practice.  But for viewers whose lives are also governed by the clock, what we do see is already enough to motivate us to spend our few years on earth under the clock wisely.</p></body></html>

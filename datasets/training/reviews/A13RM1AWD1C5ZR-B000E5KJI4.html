<meta name="summary" content="Troy- It's All About Brad"></head><body><p>Ok listen, I know what you're thinking, you think I'm probably crazy to give this movie a good review, but personally I enjoyed it.  Infact I saw it twice, once with my dad and the second time with my mother since my mom wasn't able to see it with us the first time.  I must say this film has plenty of problems, during the credits of Troy, it says that this film is inspired by Homer's The Illiad, which is very inaccurate.  Sure this film is enjoyable and entertaining but in order for it to be entertaining you have to ignore the fact that The Illiad even exists.<br />  But the $200 million budget of the film shows.  The cinematography is great, the sets are pretty extraodinary and the acting is decent.  Achilles is not a role made for Brad Pitt but I should point out that Pitt is a fine actor, this just isn't a role made for him.  While Brad Pitt does look the part he certainly isn't it, though I do commend him for his hard work in preparing for the physical aspects of the role, he just lacks grandiosity.  But you pretty much have to enjoy this as a Brad Pitt movie. Better movies with him include Fight Club and Se7en.  Eric Bana as Hector was very impressive infact his performance along with Peter O'Toole's performance as King Priam were the only really worthy ones.  Orlando BLoom as Paris and Diane Krueger as Helen, well enough said, I mean sure they look good but they just aren't convincing enough.  Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson were fine though I should point out.<br />  This film wasn't horrific as some people view it to be.  I must say I did expect more considering that Wolfgang Petersen directed this film, he's made some great films such as Das Boot, Air Force One and In the Line of Fire, and The Perfect Storm was decent.  James Horner's score wasn't abhorrent as some people claim it to be, infact I didn't know that Gabriel Yared the original composer was fired.  The battle sequences were good, but they could've done more with them due to the fact that the battle sequences resulted in a one on one combat scene.<br />The fight between Hector and Achilles was excellent though, the best one in the movie.  I'm not too sure to say if the battle sequences in this film were better than well let's say Return of the King's but they were definitely on par.  Gladiator is certainly a better epic, considering that Troy is pretty much a Gladiator wanna be.  Troy is historically confusing, overlong and lacking in parts, such as Petersen's decision to omit the Gods from the film.  This is a 2 hour and 40 minute film so I should warn you.  It's also not that bloody, Gladiator is a lot bloodier.  While Troy is entertaining it does have its problems,<br />but call me insane but I might consider purchasing this film on DVD, but that's not for sure yet.<br />  Troy is rated R for Graphic Violence and Some Sexuality/Nudity.  The battles in Troy are aggressive and fierce<br />but aren't very graphic, there's some occasional blood.  The battles include the use of spears, arrows, swords, etc.  The sexual content isn't really explicit which was a let down, just kidding.  There was some steamy kissing, and partial nudity.  All in all, an enjoyable epic which is worth seeing in theatres but incase you chose not to see it definetly rent it when it hits the shelves at Blockbuster.</p></body></html>

Madagascar is a love-it-or-hate-it experience, it would seem, and the two sides have been debating it at a white-hot pace I haven't seen since a whole bunch of people missed the point of The Blair Witch Project. (Not to start THAT endless debate again.)<br /><br />One of the best things about watching cartoons from the sixties and before was that they weren't just made for kids. I'm not just talking about the odd joke stuck in every once in a while that adults would get and kids wouldn't-- cartoons were not made for kids back in the day. There were more jokes that the adults would get than the kids would. In every cartoon. (And the farther back you go, the more that's true; the kid's grandmother picked up some VHS tapes of cartoon reels from the twenties and thirties at a garage sale a few years back. I think they're hysterical, even when I'm missing about half the jokes because I'm too young and being vaguely offended at the inherent racism in some of them. The kid doesn't get them at all.) Needless to say, if you were to try and make a cartoon like that today, a whole lot of people would think it sucks because, well, it's got too much stuff in it that the kiddies won't get.<br /><br />Enter Madagascar. It is that cartoon. And that has been the point that has, predictably, brought so much fire. I have my suspicions it has drawn such harsh criticism on this topic because there were some jokes that most of the adults didn't get, either (the guy frantically waving the To Serve Lemur book, which I found one of the funniest moments of the movie, occasioned laughs from maybe five people in the packed house where I saw it, and none of the other adults with me go the reference). No one likes to look dumb when his kid asks "what did that mean?"<br /><br />One of the other complaints about the movie is that it is, essentially, plotless. This is a valid point, but I'm not sure that makes it a valid criticism, especially in an animated feature. Lord knows there have been some recent American animations where the plot and its underlying theme have been so ham-handed that a plotless film is a breath of fresh air (Brother Bear immediately comes to mind). And yes, Madagascar does come off rather like a slightly-less-than-ninety-minute episode of a sitcom. But it's been a long, long time since America came up with a sitcom even remotely as funny as Madagascar-- probably because, again, the jokes in Madagascar are actually aimed at adults a good deal of the time. What was the last American sitcom where that was true? (The Brits, on the other hand, are quite good at this sort of thing. But that's another endless debate.)<br /><br />Basically, go into expecting a cartoon, not a kids' film, and you'll get a lot more out of the experience. And there's a lot to be gotten, though obviously some folks need a pop culture concordance to get it.</p></body></html>

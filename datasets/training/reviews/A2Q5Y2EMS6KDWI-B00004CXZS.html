<meta name="summary" content=""The Wrath of Khan" puts the Enterprise on the right course!"></head><body><p>When "Star Trek: the Motion Picture" was released, fan reaction was mixed. Although eagerly awaited by Trekkies, the results were mediocre; the special effects seemed to be the true star, not the crew of the Enterprise. Nevertheless, the initial film did incredibly well, offset by the fact everyone were just plain happy to see the return of Kirk, Spock & Co.<br /><br />But no one was satisfied; not cast or crew or fans. Enter writer/producer Harve Bennett. He wanted to "build a better beast". And so, he got back to the original series' roots, screening all the old episodes. No ideas, that is, until he came across "Space Seed". Then he said, "That's it! We're bringing back Khan!" And that's how "Star Trek II" was born.<br /><br />TWOK (The Wrath of Khan) brings the Trek saga back to story & characterization, with a smattering of morality. The film explores the passage of time: growing old while still playing a "young man's game"; the contrast between seasoned crew members and their young trainees; sacrifice, death and hope; and how vengeance can be all-consuming.<br /><br />The latter statement, of course, refers to Khan, reprised with delicious zeal and double-dyed villiany by Ricardo Montalban. If done wrong, his role could have come off as laughable (his wig and garb make him look like an aging 80's metal rocker!). But instead, Montalban turns in an amazing performance, portraying a tyrant seething with rage and revenge for the past 15 years. An opportunity lands in his lap to exact revenge on Kirk, and he does not hesitate to take it.<br /><br />Most controversial was the demise of Trek's beloved Vulcan, Spock. The death scene is played beautifully between Nimoy and Shatner, and the eulogy is very touching: "..Of all the souls I've encountered in my travels, his was the most..human..of all."<br /><br />The dogfight inside the nebula, in which both ships "fly blind" with no sensors or shields, was well-staged and exciting.<br /><br />Fine supporting turns from Bibi Besch (Kirk's former lover, Carol Marcus), Kirstie Alley (Lt. Saavik, Alley's first film role), and Merritt Butrick (Kirk's son, David; sadly, Butrick died young in 1989), as well as the original crew.<br /><br />"The Motion Picture" may have been their first screen adventure, but TWOK is definitely the best; for it set the legend on the right course and cast the mold for future films.</p></body></html>

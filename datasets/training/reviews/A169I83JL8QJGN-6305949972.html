<meta name="summary" content="3D as value added feature works"></head><body><p>I only had this film on DVD and needed an excuse to upgrade, this combo package gave me the excuse I needed. I am a huge fan of 3D when it is done right, and I recognize converted films don't always look great in 3D, but this one is actually pretty nice. The 3D does work very well by way of adding depth to the film, it's like you're watching through a window, though this feature is more like a value added bonus, it doesn't really add anything to the film itself because the film was not originally intended to be a 3D film. Still it looks good as a nice bonus and you shouldn't shy away from this package, especially if you were turned off by Clash of the Titans, this film makes the case that you can have good 3D conversions.</p></body></html>

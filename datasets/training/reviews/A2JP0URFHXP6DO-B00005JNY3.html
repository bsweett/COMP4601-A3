<meta name="summary" content="A VERY EFFECTIVE LITTLE THRILLER"></head><body><p>Skeleton Key is one of the more surprising thriller/chillers that has come along in quite some time.  Kate Hudson is Caroline, a nursing student who leaves a job at a nursing home to take a position in a home health care environment, deep in the Louisiana Bayou.  She comes to the old, southern home of the Devereaux's. This is one of those overgrown, mossy, humid, stifling old homes.  Her patient Ben played by John Hurt is an invalid who has suffered a major stroke and cannot talk or walk.  Gena Rowlands is his wife Violet, a rather abrupt woman who doubts that Caroline can handle the job.  Also in the mix is the Devereaux's attorney Luke who actually hired Caroline.<br /><br />Immediately Caroline notices several strange things about the old mansion.  First, there are no mirrors in the house at all.  Violet brushes off Caroline's questions about this.  Second, Caroline gets a skeleton key that unlocks every door in the house.  While exploring the old attic, she finds a door hidden behind a shelf but the key will not unlock that door.  Again Violet dismisses her, saying the key has never worked on that door and they've never opened it in all the years they've been at the house.  Add to that, Ben seems to be trying to communicate with Caroline, asking for help.<br /><br />Eventually opening that door in the attic, Caroline discovers off books and items, and old records which seem to be intoning magical rituals.  Her friend Jill, a native of the bayou explains this as "hoodoo" an old African magic that only works if you believe in it.  Violet finally admits that many years ago two black servants were caught practicing this magic and were killed by the man they worked for and that the room in the attic was theirs.  Caroline becomes convinced that Ben is under the influence of this magic and is determined to try and help him and soon finds herself entangled in a deadly plot of ancient magic.<br /><br />Skeleton Key relies heavily on its permeable atmosphere and does so very effectively.  The frights are mostly shrouded and hinted at in very Lovecraftian style.  Rowlands is terrific as the slightly sinister mistress with deep secrets hidden away.  Hurt, playing primarily a role with very little dialog is also great.  He conveys more with his eyes and expressions than many actors could with their voices.  Other than perhaps being just a bit predictable, Skeleton Key is a nice little thriller.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson</p></body></html>

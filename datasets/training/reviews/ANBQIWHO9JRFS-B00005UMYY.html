I'd heard nothing but good things, pretty much, but it sounded gimmicky, and like precisely the sort of slightly arty, slightly innovative film that stupid people and mainstream critics will see and proclaim it genius, and, worse yet, somehow imagine that their love of this film make them smart. (I'm no indie/intellectual film snob, mind you, but I can usually spot a sacred cow from quite a distance)  And I suppose I was right, partially, as looking at the review for this it's apparent that more than a few dummards are claiming 'Memento' to be the greatest, most original film ever.  And, yeah, they don't know what the hell they're talking about, but they manage to be almost right anyway.  Still, on top of being a first-rate thriller (well, more or less a thriller anyway.) 'Memento' has got a real human interest angle, and prods into some ideas with regards to reality and perception.(It may not be incredibly revelatory, but few films inspire the mind at all.)<br /><br />I suppose I should summarize the basic plot: Leonard Shelby is on a quest to avenge his murdered wife.  Unfortunately, during the attack he was injured, and can no longer make new memories.  Thus, he's got grope through the present, with only notes and tattoos and instinct to guide him towards his goal.  As you would imagine, this can get pretty damn complicated.  Personally, I don't think the whole backwards chronology gimmick is all that hot of an idea, in and of itself, and it's certainly not original to this film.  Of course, Nolan redeems it through the second conceit, which is that Leonard, has no short-term memory, thus placing us in his shoes, as much as is possible via the reverse chronology. (i.e. he doesn't know what happened in the previous scene, chronologically and neither do we.)  Normally, this would just be a cheap gimmick, an easy way for the director/writer to keep us in the dark, and create cheap, obvious ironies, but now there's actually a legitimate, defensible reason for presenting the film this way.<br /><br />It would be inappropriate to discuss plot details, though suffice to say that the other characters in the film well understand how easy it would be to manipulate a person with no memory.  Still, clever and intriguing as the plot is, the character of Leonard is perhaps the most interesting part of the film.  Personally, I find him to be a great, tragic and highly sympathetic figure.  He's particularly compelling to me, as I find revenge to be a rather romantic notion.  I'm sure many will disagree with me, and say that it's meaningless, but that's precisely the point.  This is heightened by the fact that Leonard will never know if he gets his revenge, not inside anyway.  But, the principle of the thing is enough to drive him.  Of course, we eventually learn that not everything is the way it appears, but this only undermines it all slightly, as there is still abundant reason why he should want to kill John G.  And, Leonard's condition is so hopelessly screwed up and existentially twisted that you can't help but feel for him.  Living completely in a void is a scary thing, and the film helps you  really reflect on these things in a way you probably haven't before.<br /><br />Performances are all excellent, though special note goes, again, to Guy Pearce as Leonard.  He's in a really complicated spot, as there really no guidebook for how to play this role, as he's got to continually be in a sorta semi-confused state, reacting to a scene as he perceives he should, but not really feeling why. (or vice versa)  Nolan's direction is stylish and sharp, though it doesn't draw as much attention to itself as it might have, which is probably a good thing.  The score is effective too, lotsa low-key, pulsing stuff, but still charged with emotion.<br /><br />Yeah, it's a great movie.  Clever plot + emotional resonance.  Usually you only get one, if that.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

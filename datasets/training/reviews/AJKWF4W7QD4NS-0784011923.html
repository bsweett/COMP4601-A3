<meta name="summary" content="One of the best sci-fi action thrillers of all time"></head><body><p>This is the film that cemented director James Cameron as a visionary director, and also cemented Arnold Schwarzenegger as a premier action superstar.  Schwarzenegger is chillingly perfect as the heartless, soulless cyborg killer sent back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who will unknowingly in the future give birth to a son named John who will become leader of a human resistance in a distant future war with cyborgs called Terminators.  Michael Biehn plays a soldier sent back in time as well to protect Sarah and stop the Terminator from fulfilling his mission.  Imaginitive special effects and makeup are abound, and the film is action packed from beginning to end, and all the actors give superb performances, but this is mainly Arnold's show, and like I said before he is chillingly perfect.  A little side note: Arnold was originally supposed to play the soldier sent to protect Sarah, and Lance Henriksen (who plays a cop) was supposed to be the Terminator, but Arnold expressed to Cameron that he would do better as the Terminator, and he was dead on the money.  Look for Bill Paxton as a punk in the beginning of the movie, he has an unfortunate run in with good 'ol Arnold.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Thriller With Great Performances, Nice Plot Twists"></head><body><p>"Red Eye" is an airborne thriller about a young woman (the stunning Rachel McAdams) who meets a stranger (Cillian Murphy) in an airport, and sparks instantly fly.  A short time later, she isn't too upset to find that they're seated together on the same plane.  The initial attraction isn't helped along too much, though, when the stranger whispers a dark secret about himself.<br /><br />  The initial set-up has so much potential it would almost be hard for the filmmakers to mess it up, but the question was would it be able to hold up that edge-of-the-seat tension with the entire next hour (approximately) of the movie taking place with the two characters aboard a plane, usually seated right next to each other, without a high level of physical action.  Fortunately, the answer was an unequivocal Yes, with things not dragging or losing momentum for one minute.  It took a lot of skill to put this together, and McAdams and Murphy both deliver standout performances.  "Red Eye" is consistently innovative, quicker-paced than one might think by its premise, and believable.  It makes some nice swerves along the way, and nails the finale dead-on.  Among director Wes Craven's best in years and years, this one gets a strong 8.5/10</p></body></html>

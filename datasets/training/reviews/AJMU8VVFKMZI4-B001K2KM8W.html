The strongest performance came from Sergi Lopez as Captain Vidal.  I was more into the drama unfolding between the grown ups than what Ofelia was going through.  CGI and special effects are really good.  The Brothers Grimm influence is very obvious and nicely done.  Overall, it's pretty good, just not the best film of 2006.</p></body></html>

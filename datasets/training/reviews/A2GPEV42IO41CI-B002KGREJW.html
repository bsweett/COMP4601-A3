<meta name="summary" content=""Where is your grandpa now?""></head><body><p>This very funny comedy concerns old Olive, a sweet little seven-year old who wants to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California.  She lives with her eccentric family in New Mexico, so the whole brood piles into the old VW bus for a road trip, and there's never a dull moment.  Her father (played by Greg Kinnear) is a failed motivational speaker, her grandfather (Alan Arkin) is a trouble-making curmudgeon, her uncle (Steve Carell) is suicidal, her mother (Toni Collette) is always screaming, and her alienated fifteen-year old brother refuses to speak.  They all go through a lot on the trip, are deeply affected by changes, and leave California stronger than ever.<br /><br />The excellent ensemble cast and surprisingly clever script make this a genuinely funny comedy with many laugh-out-loud moments and just the right blend of serious and touching and manically silly.  Except for the constant use of foul language, it's a movie everyone could enjoy.  The script gives each member of the family plenty of time to shine, and each part was perfectly-cast.  I left the theatre with a smile on my face, glad that I saw this movie, and that's something that doesn't happen often these days.</p></body></html>

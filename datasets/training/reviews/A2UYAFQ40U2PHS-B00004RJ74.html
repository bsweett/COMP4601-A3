This is really just a vanity project for Tarantino, who proves that ego doesn't make you a great actor.  This was made in 1996, when Tarantino (and Rodriguez, to a lesser extent) were movie "rock stars".  They could do whatever they wanted.  Quentin decided that he wanted to write and act in a film, and he shows he can't act for &%$%&.  He is really bad here.  His script is really boring, filled with cliches, and just used as an excuse to show carnage and gore at the end of the film.  Lewis and Kietel just seem to be going through the motions here, and Rodriguez's direction is very uninspiring.  Avoid, avoid.</p></body></html>

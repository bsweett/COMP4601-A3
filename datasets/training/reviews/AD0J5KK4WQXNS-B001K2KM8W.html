Most of the film is occupied by a war theme while the fantasy remains somewhat back-story. It is also incredibly more violent than one might have expected.<br /><br />The story revolves around a young girl who is living on a farm with her mother and stepfather in law from hell who commands a squadron that is under siege by a small band of rebel militia. The girl, torn between the domineering male parent and the war, discovers a world where a fawn asks her to complete a set of tasks so that she can inherit a magical kingdom.<br /><br />While the film probably contains the most memorable bad guy of all time, it still comes across as deficient in its promise of beyond the imagination worlds. However they are done above par. Viewers can expect a war drama more than anything else. The film's underlying morals about questioning authority are worth learning; however they do conflict somewhat with its Christian underpinnings. Pan's Labyrinth is essentially C.S Lewis but is rendered in buckets of blood.</p></body></html>

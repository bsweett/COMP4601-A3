The latest iteration of the Toy Story series milks the generational span of the fans that were kids for the first in the series.  In the film, the toys are packed up and stored or discarded when their master, Andy, leaves for college.<br /><br />The journey the toys must take is a metaphor for the perils and spiritual fears many of us experience in real life.  The toys take a journey that literally leads to the gates of hell -- a yawning, gaping, molten fire-pit at a mammoth recycling center.  Not sure what the lesson is here, or how Jung might explain the symbolic meaning of the events and the identity of the toys themselves.  I always thought it was interesting that the two leads were called Buzz and Woody.  Drugs and sex seemed to more than an accidental inference.  There are other subversive moments disguised as a kid's movie.<br /><br />This is a reverse coming of age movie in which a human character comes to terms with his childhood and the non-human characters continue with their imagined lives.  But in whose head are they dwelling.  We all know they are merely inanimate, non-sentient toys.  Don't we?<br /><br />All the original voice talent are back including Tom Hanks and Tim Allen plus Michael Keaton as Ken and Ned Beatty as Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear.<br />The Blu-ray transfer, both image and sound, is simply breathtaking, certainly cutting edge.  There's something hypnotic about the world of the story and the incredible attention to detail -- especially the physics of the movement, the texture and lighting.  The generous extras will fascinate for hours and hours.</p></body></html>

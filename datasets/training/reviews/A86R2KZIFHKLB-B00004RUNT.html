The remastered version on blu-ray is spectacular, excellent transfer. This movie proves it can be humorous, even in the face of world ending evil. This movie has something for everyone, aliens, carnage, scientists, evil men, a really evil entity, adventure, heroism, guns, bombs, explosions, love, and saving the world. A great mix for a movie. Enjoy the view!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Every Picture Tells A Story..."></head><body><p>Horror legend David Cronenberg (Rabid, Scanners, The Brood, Videodrome, etc.) teams up once more w/ A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE star Viggo Mortensen (The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, A Perfect Murder) to create the dark, underworld masterpiece, EASTERN PROMISES. Mortensen plays Nikolai, a russian mobster w/ a lifetime's worth of lethal experience to go along w/ his body full of prison tattoos. Nikolai is a seemingly ice-cold killer without conscience. Or is he? Midwife, Anna (Naomi Watts from The Ring 1 and 2, King Kong) is plunged into the russian-mafia world after a young mother dies, leaving behind a newborn daughter and a mysterious diary. PROMISES is packed w/ tension, horrific revelations, and a cast of iron-clad characters, including Vincent Cassel as the drunken, very dangerous Kirill, and Armin Mueller-Stahl as the quietly menacing Semyon. Even the minor characters are well-written. Don't miss this one!...</p></body></html>

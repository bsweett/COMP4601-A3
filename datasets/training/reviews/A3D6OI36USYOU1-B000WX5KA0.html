Or maybe that's the allure for some people. If you look at the votes for this thing people either love it or hate it. I'm mostly indifferent. <p>One of the many problems I have with Taxi Driver is that there are too many unanswered questions about Travis' background, experience in the Marine Corp, etc. We know he was discharged while Vietnam was winding down but we don't have a clue what the source of his so-called "instability" is. Are we to assume that he had suffered some sort of trauma during the war...did he ever see any action...was he really discharged because of his instability? In fact, the guy seems perfectly normal other than a slightly obsessive compulsive complex which 70% of society is sporting, and he can't sleep. Awwww, poor thing... big deal. Does that alone make Travis a candidate for the nuthouse? NO! The truth is, we don't know what his alleged issues stem from and that is a major problem with this movie. His descent is so spontaneous when Betsy reacts about being dragged to an adult film, and he just snaps, we don't know why?!? (spoiler alert) Next thing you know the guy is buying guns like there's no tomorrow to feed his all-of-a-sudden John Wayne complex that springs from a source we can't, as an audience, connect with. <p>Good individual performances don't make a film, and don't salvage the many holes that litter the canvas of this highly overated drama. And somebody please explain to me all this talk about Travis searching for "redemption", from WHAT?? Jeez! The campy final shootout is a little too reminiscent of the Wild Bunch where spurting blood and bad editing wooed critics all around. The popularity of which is a tribute to the end of Western Civilization. And you know if my illegitimate brother from BizzaroWorld, boydjt, likes this thing it's got to be pretty bad. 2 checkers.</p></body></html>

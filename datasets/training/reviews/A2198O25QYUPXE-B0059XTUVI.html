<meta name="summary" content="An iron life and political career"></head><body><p>"The Iron Lady" is a biographical drama film of the life of Baroness Margaret Thatcher.<br /><br />The narrative focuses on an aging Thatcher with fading health, reflectively looking back on her life and career.<br /><br />It was ambitious of the film directors to try and incorporate so many facets of Thatcher's life into a single feature film. This is because several aspects of her life are significant enough to be separate films. For example her rise within the Conservative Party as a female politician or the Falklands War both contain enough depth to be separate films. Notwithstanding this the viewer is presented with numerous major events in Thatcher's life such as: her admittance to Oxford University as the daughter of a green grocer, her progression as a Conservative Member of Parliament, tenure as Leader of the Opposition, and eleven years as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.<br /><br />The quality of acting is engaging and this film honourably acknowledges Thatcher's breakthrough political career.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

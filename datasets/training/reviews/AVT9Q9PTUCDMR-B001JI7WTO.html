<meta name="summary" content="extras are better than actual movie"></head><body><p>Skip the movie and go straight to the extra features. There's a terrific one on the whole "hollow Earth" movement that fueled Jules Verne's imagination to write the terrific book on which this lame movie is based on.<br /><br />No amount of special effects can save this as the movie just meanders all over the place. Brendan Fraser cannot carry movies unless they are comedies. The female actress (whose name I've forgotten already) is unmmemorable and if she's supposed to have an Icelandic accent it keeps morphing into British. The young kid is also hopeless in this.<br /><br />Really, it's not any of these actors' faults as the script is just brutal.<br /><br />Literally, I ended up doing chores around the house as this ran as after awhile I just gave up. It's beyond dull. (Plus as posting of Aug. 25, 2001, there are over 200 used copies of this for sale starting from 16 cents so that says a lot more than any review.)</p></body></html>

So how could I resist picking up 2000's loosely tied in follow-on Snatch (aka Lock, Stock and Six Stolen Diamonds)?<br /><br />In Snatch, several of the actors are back from "Lock, Stock", but all playing unrelated characters along side Brad Pitt. The first few minutes of Snatch looked like it was going to be a cash-in imitation of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but Snatch quickly developed its own story and characters.<br /><br />Both "Lock, Stock" and Snatch are stylistically similar presentation-wise in a Pulp Fiction (1994) kind of way: Characters involved with various criminal activity are unaware of each other's presence throughout most of the movie, but then they are ultimately all connected by the closing credits.<br /><br />There is a lot of violence seasoned with a good amount of black comedy. The acting is great. Ritchie is a master at getting a realistic reaction out of his cast...not just to situations and shocking acts of violence, but to people. The way the cast reacts to Brad Pitt's character is as believable as it is priceless.<br /><br />Brad Pitt does a great job in this movie. I've seen a lot of criticism about Pitt's acting abilities, but I've got to say that I am mostly impressed with the roles that I've seen him in. And his character in Snatch, due to how well he played it, will stand out in my mind for a long time.<br /><br />Jason Statham is as good as ever too. Like Samuel L. Jackson, Statham always seems to be the same guy in all of the movies he's in...same persona. And it just works every time.<br /><br />Looking for a blast from the past with good actors, good action and a good story? Look no further. Here it is. Snatch may not be a collector's item, but it's worth the price.<br /><br />And check out Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels too if you've not done so already.</p></body></html>

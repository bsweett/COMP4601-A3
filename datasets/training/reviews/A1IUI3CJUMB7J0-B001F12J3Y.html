<meta name="summary" content="It gets you in the christmas mood"></head><body><p>I am a huge fan of christmas movies and found this one enjoyable. The film aims moor to the younger age but anyone can also enjoy the film. The film gets you right in the christmas mood and features some good chritmas songs. The best thing about the film is the animation it's great the only bad animation was santa I felt like he looked the least real of all the charactors. The story is slow at the begging and dosent get really good till the middle. But again it's a good christmas movie to get you in a festive mood.</p></body></html>

Oh yeah, and in this case served hot. With maybe, a few rat hairs. It is, climatically, the settling point for many cases in a movie filled with warm messages. We get confessions aplenty, because confessions free the spirit. Confessions from a daunting critic, Antun Ego (Peter o'Toole), whose brutal review of the parisian chef Auguste Gusteau, leads to Gusteau's premature death (he was very fat also so that helps). Satisfied with the destruction of the famous Gusteau (much like today's tabloids and almost heretical demands from our public towards any celebrity) he turns the page, as we say, on those things and files it in some drawer and moves on to another hapless professional. Confessions ultimately lead to....redemptions. And those are plenty also. We have messeges about the importance of family, and of love and the pursuit of happiness. You can learn alot, and disregard human prejudices, therefor becoming more receptive, by embodying human themes with cute and hilarious animals. Voila.</p></body></html>

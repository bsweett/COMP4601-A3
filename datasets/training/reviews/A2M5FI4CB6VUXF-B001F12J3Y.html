And as long as you continue to get on the train, you'll grasp the meaning of Christmas. The TRUE meaning of Christmas. But you have to be willing to get on.<br /><br />This movie was a great adaptation of the classic story. I must admit I was a tad bit wigged out by the animation. It was just oogey in some ways. Realistic at times and, at other times, so unbelievably fake...<br /><br />I couldn't decide if I liked the animation or not. Still can't. But the story itself is worth the struggle I had with the animation.<br /><br />Get on board! You'll be glad you did.</p></body></html>

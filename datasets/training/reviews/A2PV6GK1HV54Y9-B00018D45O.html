<meta name="summary" content="A bloody mess."></head><body><p>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one bloody movie, I liked this film but I was never a fan of the original one so I was hoping this version would be different and it was. Jessica Biel is pretty good in this, I was expecting her to be horrific but she surprised me, she didn't over do it. The ending is too much but the first hour is the most intriguing. This film is gruesome so be forwarned if you are not into all the blood and guts.</p></body></html>

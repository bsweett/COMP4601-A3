The period details are perfect, creating a heart-breaking realism. The cast couldn't be better. The leads , of course, have all gone on to remarkable careers. Danzel Washington stands out, giving one of his most moving and powerful performances. It continues to be a painful, sad, yet uplifting film. Why this is so has to do with the remarkable film-making of the director. Much of the film is silent. There is very little dialog really, lots of battle scenes, lots of slow-motion, beautiful music. Simplicity is the key. Each character grows in this film, there are no stereotypes. We care deeply about each and every one of them. The final shot of the dead Captain is very painful to see. It is a picture about the horror of war, but not about the horror of this war, however horrible it may have been. For every good man, there is a bad. For every act of decency, there is a substantial crime. It takes a small amount of courage just to watch the film. The culture wars sometimes make one wonder what has become of our so-called institutions of learning, but this little picture proves that we are heading in the right direction by telling stories once ignored.</p></body></html>

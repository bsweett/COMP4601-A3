Cage is wonderfully cast as Johnny Blaze but jeez who's dummy who cast Eva Mendes, that gal can't act! Peter Fonda, Sam Elliott, and Wes Bently also star, each have great moments in the film. The special effects are the best thing in the film but the story is muddled so that's why I give the film only three stars. Definitely one to watch, give it a chance.</p></body></html>

The plot pulls you in, but fans will be waiting to see which song they use next. The reason this didn't get a perfect score is because of the story. I sometimes had a hard time following it, but luckily, this film doesn't need a story to be great. It has some brilliant visuals and songs that will have you dancing if you love the Beatles. The style of most of the songs are changed, but it still has the "Fab Four Feel" to them. Beatles fans, you need to see this movie. To me, this is the Beatles version of Pink Floyd's The Wall. Classic!</p></body></html>

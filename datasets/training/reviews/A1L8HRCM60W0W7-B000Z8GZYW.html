<meta name="summary" content="BREEZY, WILDLY IMAGINATIVE CAPER COMEDY WITH A MESSAGE"></head><body><p>As close as a comedy can come to resembling a riveting suspense thriller without any murders or misdemeanours but a simple, engrossing premise -- a weather man caught up in a circadian cycle and having to relive variations of same moments with the same people around him.<br /><br />  How easily this could have imploded into insipid ideas but Groundhog Day succumbs to none of them. Danny Rubin's crisp writing comes up with a plenty of subtle swerves on the same encounters, mining new laughs out of Murray, who is not just great, he literally yanks the movie to life with his delirious impulses and effortless improvisation.<br /><br />  Best bit, apart from being the hilarious caper it is, the movie also couches a beautiful dynamic. Our quirky weatherman begins as a grouch, but through his existential tapeloop (the movie doesn't hint how many times he goes through it, but the crafts he picks up along the way suggest a number in the hundreds at the least) he undergoes a redemption that implies how we can, through sheer purity of intent and determination, get out of our respective ruts and make meaningful contributions to the world.<br /><br />  My humble suggestion: stop reading and get down to watching this all-time classic, pronto, on your own DVD disc, which will undoubtedly be one of your most prized possessions.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Keanu Reeves plays Buddha in black"></head><body><p>Once again the graphics outstretched the story, and for this day and age the CGI did not exceed that of most movies.  The continuing saga of the movie requires that you have seen the first one to get the proper background information.  As with Keanu Reeves' portrayal of Siddhartha in "Little Buddha" (1994), this time a change of costume and he must deal with impermanence and the Vedic cycles.  Super imposed on this gem of understanding is excessive action that would rival that of "Kung Pow!  Enter the Fist" (2002).<br /><br />Neo is supposed to be "The One" according to prophecy.  According to Morpheus he is to lead the people out of bondage.<br /><br />Is the oracle what she appears to be?<br /><br />Will Neo, in the midst of endless kicking and shooting, go on to fulfill his destiny?<br /><br />Or will the love of Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) interfere?<br /><br />This story is not so comprehensive. It needs to be viewed as part of the series to make it worth viewing.</p></body></html>

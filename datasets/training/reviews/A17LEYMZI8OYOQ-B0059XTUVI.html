<meta name="summary" content="Streep is Remarkable!"></head><body><p>Meryl Streep certainly deserved the Best Actress Oscar for her remarkable performance as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in THE IRON LADY, as did make-up artists Mark Coulier and J. Roy Helland for their work on the production.  Indeed, when she is playing the elderly Thatcher, if you didn't know that was Meryl Streep up on the screen, you wouldn't know that was Meryl Streep up on the screen.<br /><br />Sadly, Streep's performance is really the only reason the see this 2011release, because the movie itself is rather dull.<br /><br />The problem lies in its approach to the material.  The story is told in flashbacks, which can often work, but in this instance director Phyllida Lloyd and screenwriter Abi Morgan have chosen to spend far more screen time with the aged, delusional Thatcher ,  having conversations with her late husband (Jim Broadbent), rather than focusing on her political career, which would have been far more interesting.<br /><br />Broadbent and all of the other actors, particularly Alexandra Roach and Harry Lloyd, playing the younger versions of Streep and Broadbent, are exceptional, but a film that prefers to concentrate on the framing story undercuts them all.<br /><br />I would have liked to have learned a lot more about Margaret Thatcher than I did from this picture.<br /><br />THE IRON LADY has been released in a 3-disc Blu-Ray Combo Pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment.  Extras include many "Making of" featurettes that are enhanced with interviews with the actors and filmmakers.<br /><br />? Michael B. Druxman</p></body></html>

Up until the end of the movie, I was loving every minute of it. The film was staying 98% true to the graphic novel and then it all fell apart within the last hour. Things are cut, changed and the lack of urgency about saving the world is missing. In the novel, there is a real urgency about Dr. Manhattan and his need to return to save the planet, but the emotion of it is lost in the film. The main reason being things being cut, crucial parts being left out, and other plot points being changed (as mentioned before). I had to explain what was happening on screen to help fill the gaps to the others I was watching it with who haven't read the book. That's bad when there are pieces missing I have to fill for the film to make sense.<br /><br />Between the two (book and movie), the book is better. I'd recommend this movie probably more to those who haven't read the novel. That being said, I still liked it overall for the most part. It's not a waste of time, but what could have been a great movie ended up being just good to okay.</p></body></html>

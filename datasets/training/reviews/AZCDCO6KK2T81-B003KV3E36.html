<meta name="summary" content="The return of Rambo"></head><body><p>There isn't a lot of dialogue or even plot to this action film, but that doesn't mean it has no message.<br /><br />Stallone, still impressive at 60, brings back another beloved icon of film, John Rambo.  The plot is deceptively simple in that a small band of religious good deed doers want to sneak into a Burmese village to give some much needed aid and go to the one nut case most likely willing to take them up the dangerous river, Rambo.  While he thinks they are foolish wishful thinkers, he does take them up and does so without payment of any kind making one think that deep down, Rambo would love to seem the succeed somehow after all the violence he has seen.  He even says, in a rare moment when he does speak, that they, these religious warriors, have good lives that they should be grateful for instead of coming here in a vain attempt to change things.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Rambo turns out to be all too right in that their attempts end up getting an entire village wiped out and themselves held captive.  Rambo is then hired by a small commando group of mercenaries to retrieve the kidnapped church team and, naturally, all hell breaks lose.<br /><br />The violence, contrary to some critics, is NOT the type we've seen before.  The battle sequences are disturbing realistic and capture the brutality of war, especially a civil one, in all its intensity.  We see people literally blown apart by mines, 50 caliber machine guns, and bombs.  We see children crushed under boot in front of parents and parents hacked to death in front of their children.  We witnessed rapes interspersed with these other violent images.  It's horrific to say the least.  My heart sank as I watched this realizing it was probably all too realistic.<br /><br />For me the main theme of this Rambo film is a constant theme in our world today, "Man's inhumanity to man."  Is there anything in the natural world that even comes close to what we humans do to each other over land, race, religion, ethnicity, or social class?  I think this is what this Rambo film is all about.<br /><br />I know that Stallone is criticized for what some call a vain attempt to relive his youth, to bring back a franchise, and just plain old make money, and the fact remains that all this may very well be true, but these "facts" don't change the fact that this is a powerful film that is well-crafted.  Stallone has always been an excellent actor, screenwriter and director, and just as he pulled off a terrific end to his Rocky character recently, this is an appropriate end to his other much loved character, Rambo.<br /><br />I consider this film a must-see.  Either rent it or own it.</p></body></html>

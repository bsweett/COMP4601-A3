When the spacecraft crashes on an isolated planet, only a few survive, including Claudia Black (Farscape), Cole Hauser, and Radha Mitchell.  During the day, the planet is a barren dessert, and the survivors worry that they will die of thirst; as night falls, they find that they are prey to a terrifying foe.  The survivors find themselves relying on Riddick, despite their hesitation.  <p>Pitch Black is a solid sci-fi thriller, despite its relatively low budget (23 million).  The director, David Twohy (writer of "The Fugitive"), manages to maintain a genuinely creepy atmosphere throughout the movie and keeps the movie unpredictable.  Ultimately, it's the type of well-crafted B-movie that is rarely made today, and it helped make Vin Diesel a star.  Pitch Black is likely to become a cult classic, helped immeasurably by the forthcoming planned sequel "The Chronicles of Riddick."<p>Extras: The DVD features an excellent director commentary track, which sustains a nice balance between technical description of special effects and more general aspects of how the movie was created.</p></body></html>

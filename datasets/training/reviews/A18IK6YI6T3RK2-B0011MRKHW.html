Clive Owen is game as Sir Walter, but he and Blanchette dont really have much chemistry, and his supposed chivilry sort of falls flat.  One thing is constant in both of the Elizabeth films and that is that Geoffrey Rush is fantastic as Walsingham, he is riviting everytime he enters the frame.  This is beautiful film to look at, the imagery is amazing, the cinematographer is fantastic, it's the pacing that is the problem, at times it felt like a history lesson and the scene toward the end were Elizabeth has her requisite Braveheart moment, I wanted to laugh, it just totally fell flat.  Overall, im not sure id recommend this movie, but if you liked the first one, you might be cool with this one, and I understand they are making a third installment, so I suppose you would have to watch it, in order to understand the context of the third film.  Pretty film, but not really a good film.</p></body></html>

I have a feeling that 2011 will go down as the year the funny man killed the super hero movie. Im not one to pigeon hole an actor and I think Seth Rogen should be given the chance to spread his acting wings. Sadly he didnt do that in the Green Hornet. The movie comes off as a bromance comedy with a Rush Hour feel. I like my super hero movie gritty with doses of one liners. The Green Hornet feels more like a running one liner with a super hero subplot. Kato (Jay Chou) is the only saving grace for the movie. Great slow-mo fighting style and all the gadgets that would make Bond blush. Christoph Waltzs acting ability is severely undercut by the horrible comedic lines hes supposed to deliver. And the less said about Cameron Diaz in this movie the better. Leave your Dark Knight expectations at the door and get ready for something in between a Schumacher meets Michael Bay type movie. By all means check it out for the great special effects and comic book style camera angles. Be ready to cringe during the musical number of Gangstas Paradise which goes on much much longer than it should. C</p></body></html>

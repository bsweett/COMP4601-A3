It always looks like it's gonna turn around and become worth watching but it never does.....NEVER!<br /><br />I gave it 1 star and that's only because some of the "special fx" were good [not great]. The story line is horrible and the ending is so bad that you have to see it to believe it but, I wouldn't wish that on you and you're just a stranger reading this review.<br /><br />Bad! Bad! Grab Your Money and Run Away!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A hilarious movie, and great performance by Brosnan and Kinnear"></head><body><p>I Originally missed this movie in the theater, and I was dissapointed. So when it came out on DVD, I had to rent it. This is a Hilarious movie revolving around the life of a hitman, julian Noble (played by pierce brosnan), who is loosing his edge.  On a chance meeting in mexico Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear)happens to meet Noble at the hotel bar. Wright is a desperate business man (ad agent) attempting to get his upstart company going. Having tasted sucsess with a big firm, Wright had his life fall appart when his young son was killed by a car three years prior.  Wright is desperate to get his life, and marraige, heading in the right direction again. Noble is a man that has had one botched job as a hitman, and that is one to many, and he is struggling to keep going in the only job he knows.  Well, if you think the movie is predicatble, think again. Many twist take place in this film, and it drags your interest along with it.  The life of these two guys get entagled, by one little meeting.  This is a great movie, with humor and some sadness, arriving at a great ending for all.  So check it out.</p></body></html>

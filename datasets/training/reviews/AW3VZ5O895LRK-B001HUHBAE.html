Then there's the fact that the person who is obsessed is one of my favorite younger actors, Jake Gyllenhall. He plays a cartoonist with a San Francisco newspaper who wants to find the serial killer, the Zodiac.  Everyone else involved in it gives up as the Zodiac has a way of disappearing. Although the Zodiac's killings are especially gruesome, the movie is really not about the murders as it is about the obsession to uncover him.  I think there is something especially galling about a serial murderer who just dies a regular death and is never brought to justice.  The suspect the cartoonist focuses upon goes exactly down that road.  Yet it is not at all certain that he was the Zodiac.  All that's known is that he has been gone for a long, long time and is probably dead since his murders started forty years ago.  The supporting cast is stellar too, Mark Ruffalo as the cop, Robert Downey Jr. as a reporter and host of others.  It's in one and the same moment an absolutely chilling case yet also a world class frustrating case.  Just about everyone who was professionally involved in this case became a victim to it as well.  It just tore every person apart as it unravelled them instead of vice versa.  There are two killings which you won't be able to forget.  A couple at a lover's lane and another couple by themselves at a remote lake.  I personally wrote off going to either after watching these scenes!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A quick review for those wishing to see a great film."></head><body><p>I don't often watch contemporary films because I find most of them to reek of crummy Hollywood fluff -- this one is different, MUCH better! I'm stingy with awarding stars for films too but this one really deserves all the accolades that I can pile on.<br /><br />It's simply the story of a European Jewish guy who just wants to be a pianist. He clearly has the playing skills of Chopin and he's totally focused upon his art until WW II intervenes... thus, the viewer can anticipate his forthcoming experience(s).<br /><br />This film is a bit of a sleeper -- at least I've never heard folks talking about it much... certainly not to the level it deserves. It's really incredibly well-conceived, punctuated with terrific acting and brilliant cinematography. I was totally drawn in to this one. If you have a big-screen television, this will manifest an even greater bonus for you given the great film footage.<br /><br />I was so impressed with this film and the score that I also bought the soundtrack: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007E8SQ">The Pianist: Music from the Motion Picture</a><br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

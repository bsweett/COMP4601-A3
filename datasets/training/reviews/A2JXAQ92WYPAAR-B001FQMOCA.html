Cash is in many ways an obscure or remote figure, hard to embrace and difficult to be "crazy about" in quite the same way as one falls for the King, but what a gift. This film is a deserved tribute surely. The casting is marvelous; one can't really imagine a better group of actors being assembled. Phoenix and Witherspoon are a delightful couple. She sparkles like a star, even when he, like a stone, drops into one of his moods. The forbidding Robert Patrick plays the father as a dark force, harsh and judgmental like a Baptist minister. I loved it when June's parents waved their shotguns at the drug dealer trying to bring a stash to Johnny. Those were simple folk and simpler times. Again and again, we see pictures of the 50s and 60s in film and wonder what happened to this great country.</p></body></html>

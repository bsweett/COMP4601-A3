<meta name="summary" content="Terrific sci-fi movie with noir tendencies and decent DVD"></head><body><p>The DVD contains both formats of the movie with two commentaries: one by the filmakers and one by Roger Ebert.  It's very interesting to listen to. The other features are somewhat scimpy.  I really don't get the game about shell beach and I've never been able to get that going. Whatever, the film features a terrific supporting performance by William Hurt as the detective and a creepy Kiefer Sutherland performance to good effect.  Rufus Sewell does a good job in the lead, but his character is more or less an effect of the environment rather than an individual character for most of the film.  William Hurt's character has more individuality throughout even though he doesn't have the special power.  At any rate, it's a classic of escapist sci-fi and truly creates a world where the individual can make it anything he wants and isn't that the message that we're always trying to convince ourselves of? That we can change the world to fit our own desires, which are to the benefit of the entire world would be a goal that anybody would have.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The zombie film to own - and oh what a great ending"></head><body><p>If you want to learn the art of making a horror movie, just watch George Romero's macabre masterpiece Night of the Living Dead.  So many times, when it comes to horror, simpler is better, and this is actually a pretty simple film.  It manages to create an atmosphere of rising fear while, at the same time, serving as a veritable study in the psychology of terror.  It also has the perfect amount of humor that makes horror all the more enjoyable to me, and the truly classic ending of the film ranks among my favorite endings of all time.  This ain't Abbot &amp; Costello Meet The Mummy; this is gritty, atmospheric, gutsy horror at its best.  It no longer offers the actual fright that was its bread and butter when it was released in 1968, but it's still nightmarish enough to make many a person squirm in anticipatory dread if nothing else.<p>Who can forget the opening scene of this masterpiece?  A brother and sister drive 200 miles to lay a wreath on their father's grave, with their banter culminating in dear old Johnny's teasing his sister by moaning the words, &quot;They're coming to get you, Barbra.&quot;  Much to his surprise, &quot;they&quot; are coming to get her, and him, and untold numbers of innocent people all throughout the eastern half of the United States.  Barbra (Judith O'Dea) flees to a farmhouse, where she commences to wig out in a quiet, childlike sort of way.  She is soon joined by a young black man named Ben (Duane Jones), who becomes the driving force of the movie.  He begins boarding up the house, getting little help from his near-comatose compatriot, but it turns out that there are also five people already holed up in the cellar.  The meeting of all these minds leads to a bickering marathon, with Ben claiming authority and the measly-mouthed Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman) resisting every step of the way.  Trapped inside the house, the band of survivors does have access to radio and television, whereby they learn the extent of the unbelievable epidemic of mass murder and, later, get the news that the killers are recently deceased bodies (who have come to life in a hokey way I'll refrain from mentioning) who share a common passion for cannibalism.  The group's struggle to survive is one of increasing intensity, making for a completely absorbing movie.  Those of a psychological turn of mind can enjoy studying the widely varying reactions of each individual to what is essentially unimaginable terror.  And the ending, as I've said, is just a wondrous thing to behold.<p>You just don't necessarily need a huge budget to make a genuinely scary, classic film.  Just get a bunch of people, throw some pale makeup on them and tell them to walk funny and slow, then hole up a gang of strangers in a house surrounded by your zombies, and you've got the basic ingredients for your very own Night of the Living Dead.  Of course, only a director as talented as George Romero can turn such a film into a masterpiece, which is accomplished in no small degree by his brilliant use of black and white rather than color film.  Night of the Living Dead may well be the most famous zombie film of all time; it is without question one of the best.  If you don't have a copy of this film in your video/DVD library, even this inexpensive, bare-bones version, then your true horror movie addict credentials are a little suspect.  If you see only one zombie movie, Night of the Living Dead should be the one.</p></body></html>

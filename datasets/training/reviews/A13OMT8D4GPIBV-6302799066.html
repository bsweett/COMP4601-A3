<meta name="summary" content="Still As Effective"></head><body><p>Dr. Strangelove, originally released in 1964, is an American classic.  Stanley Kubrick's wonderful direction, and the main player's incredible action really make this a must see.  This is considered a black comedy but I know a lot of people won't be in stitches.  It's not the type of laugh out loud comedy that's come accustomed.  It's the absurdity of the situation that'll have you chuckling.<br /><br />It's a true end of the world nightmare that wasn't quite out of left field in the 60's and isn't there even today.<br /><br />This 40th Anniversary releases features a stunning transfer in its original aspect ration (a few and only a few scenes are shot in 1.33), and plenty of featurettes on the second disc.  One of my favorites is the split screen interview.<br /><br />Must Have.</p></body></html>

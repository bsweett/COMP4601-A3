<meta name="summary" content="Good action...bad script"></head><body><p>I was one of those people who resisted this film last year because Mr. Cruise was severely riding my last nerve.  But apparently I didn't stay away for long.  I agree that the action and special effects are good.  However, the script stinks to high heaven.  And camera hogging Cruise needs to learn how to share the camera.  Even our villian, Hoffman's character, had the smallest amount of screen time I've ever seen.  Hunt and his "wife" have absolutely no chemistry and I didn't buy into the love affair and I don't appreciate not being told what the heck the rabbit's foot was and what it was capable of doing.  Overall, if you're just looking for good action scenes this is the movie for you.  If you're looking something else--look somewhere else.</p></body></html>

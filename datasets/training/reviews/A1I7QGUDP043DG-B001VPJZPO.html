<meta name="summary" content="Excellent!"></head><body><p>Kate Hudson is excellent in this suspense thriller. The movie isn't pure gore, it is the type of spine tingle tale you used to enjoy around a campfire at girlscouts, or boyscouts. I love the supernatural, and the mystery of Louisiana's spooky/culture-rich bayous. The twist at the end was fantastic!!! Caught me completely off guard.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

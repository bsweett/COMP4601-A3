<meta name="summary" content="Nice cartoon but nothing spectacular"></head><body><p>This is an okay film but you can see the take off of Doc Hollywood, which is not a problem in my books because Doc Hollywood was a nice film.<br /><br />In Cars we have Lightning McQueen a rookie race car with an attitude who sees himself as the next best thing since sliced bread.  Not only does he know it, he advertises it too so he's not really a likable character.<br /><br />He is so sure of himself he is more than happy to speed on the on the road, in his arrogance he thinks he is above the law so he when he crashes into the Hill Billy town of Radiator Springs and ends up causing lots of damage he is not too happy to be sentenced to do community service to pay his debt to society.<br /><br />Lightning isn't a happy car and he all he wants to do is get away from Radiator Springs but that is going to be easier said than done and you are not sure if community service is going to make any difference to Lightning whose dreams are of the big city, lights fame and racing.<br /><br />There is a star studded cast of voices, and they do a pretty good job, Paul Newman is great as the wise old Doc Hudson and you can't help smiling at Ramon, voiced by Cheech of Cheech and Chong.<br /><br />All in all a nice little film like I said earlier, quirky and fun but nothing spectacular when I think of other animated movies I have seen over the years, not really worth going to the movies to see unless you are a real fan of Disney/Pixar, and I guess the big screen does it justice but personally I'd wait for it to come out on DVD.</p></body></html>

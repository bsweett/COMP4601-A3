<meta name="summary" content="Collatteral Review: EDIT."></head><body><p>I originally rated this movie 3 stars, but after reading some of the other bad reviews, it reminded me of how this movie downward spiraled, so I now want to lower my rating to 2 stars.  The ONLY reason I am now giving it 2 stars is because of the song being played during the coyote scene.  Cool song, dumb movie.  Thanks reviewers for inspiring me to tell the REAL truth!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="BRING ON THE SEQUEL!"></head><body><p>The Incredible Hulk is another take on one of Marvel Comics' favorite hero.<br />Having been a big fan of the 70's TV series, I find this film much better than the 2003 Ang Lee version which was seriously flawed and almost put me off from seeing this version lest there be further disappointment.<br />Edward Norton and Liv Tyler have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  They give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! The rest of the cast carry out their performances well though nothing extraordinary.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects (!!!) and the music are all wonderful!<br />In short, The Incredible Hulk is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!<br />Strongly recommended along with the 70's Incredible Hulk TV series. 4.5 Stars</p></body></html>

I went into the movie expecting nothing more than an action ride, and even though that's what I got there was a little more to Van Helsing than you would expect. Even though that "more" can in fact be too much. The story is about Gabriel Van Helsing, a vanquisher of evil who works in the name of god. He has been assigned to help Anna Valerious, the last member of her family, to kill Count Dracula. Count Dracula must be killed in order to send the rest of Anna's family to heaven and out of purgatory (I know, sounds lame . . . it is). Dracula must use Frankenstein's monster to unleash his children of the night by harvesting his energy (Sounds even lamer . . . it is). All the while, Dracula uses the aid of the wolfman as well as his evil brides to try kill Van Helsing and Anna; thus providing the audience with overdone action sequences. The dialogue of the movie is something to laugh at, as well is the lame character development, and the reality bending action. In one scene Kate Beckinsale is swinging from a cable only holding it with one hand as if she was just holding a rope while standing on a platform. The ending was a clich&eacute;. So why in God's name (no pun intended) would I give this movie two and a half stars. Well, two stars by all means is a very low score, but that half would insist that this movie is okay. It is.  The two stars go for the undeveloped plot, overdone action, and overall nonsense that is the movie. The half star is for the fact that it's fun to watch. I guarantee you will not get bored with this movie. The CGI effects are astounding and are incredible. The movie can not be seen on your TV and have the same effect that it does with a big screen and DTS. This movie is the definition for "summer blockbuster". This movie is fun, entertaining, and one hell of a ride. It just makes no sense.<p>ACTING: Hugh Jackman is perfectly cast as Van Helsing, although his acting is almost a replica of his acting as Wolverine in the X-Men films. Kate Beckinsale is the hot babe, the local gal from Transylvania with the sexy overly done accent.  Comic relief is provided by David Wenham (Best known as Faramir from The Return Of The King) and Kevin J. O'Connor as Igor (Best known as Beni Gabor from The Mummy). Who really steals the show is Richard Roxburgh as Count Dracula. A very genuine fantasy performance that is not overly done, yet not so subtle that it goes unnoticed. <p>BOTTOM LINE: Fun movie plagued by a weak (very weak) plot and weak characters. Sometimes movies like this are good because you can park your brain at the door and set it in neutral, and let the movie do its job, entertain. Stephen Sommers is a huge fan of classic horror films and is why he remade The Mummy. I guess he wanted to do remakes for all the classics and to save time he just threw them in a blender to make this romp. It's obvious why the movie cost $150 million to make just by seeing the special effects, but at times they seem overdone. 90% of the camera shots in the movie have one CGI. A fun way to kick off summer and even though highly flawed, it shouldn't detract from the overall experience of this summer flick.</p></body></html>

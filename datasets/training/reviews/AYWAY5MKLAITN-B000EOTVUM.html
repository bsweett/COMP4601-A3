<meta name="summary" content="G'day Meat! Whoops . . .I mean Mate."></head><body><p>Although the following is based on a true story, I found no original, film wise, creative plot points.<br /><br />The movie takes place in australia where three friends go to wolf creek. Of course, like all thrillers, they find themselves stranded and with no hope of getting back to their place. But, along comes a friend, supposedly, to help them.<br /><br />Some critics said that it was like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Somewhat. I can somewhat agree on that but as for the tone, style, mood, and cinema style; it's all been done before. This film, in my opinion, would have done much better as a short film or as a documentary. But to watch this movie is to watch the same stuff that's already out there. Yes, there is tension and there is suspense but the movie is Highly, highly, highly, highly predictable.<br /><br />I will say, that the villian did present himself truly. He wasn't flat or 2-demensional but, still, the movie's situations just scream "Rewrite."<br /><br />Final Verdict: Wolf creek is worth renting but not worth owning.</p></body></html>

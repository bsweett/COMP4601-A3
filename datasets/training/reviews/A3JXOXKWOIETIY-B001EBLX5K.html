Sacha Cohen never steps out of character and what makes it funny is people believe he's real.  Borat's apparent ignorance is a setup to reveal the actual ignorance of those he encounters.  Though the producers got releases some are suing him for revealing how dumb they are.<br />  Borat basically mocks all his characters attributes: antisemitism, sexism, lack of etiquette, etc. An interesting trivia note is when Borat is speaking Kazakh, he's really speaking Hebrew with some Polish thrown in.  And his sidekick is speaking Armenian.  The village is actually in Romania (and they're getting in on the lawsuits too). High five!</p></body></html>

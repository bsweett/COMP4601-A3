In about 12-24 months we're going to get word that the Star Wars movies are scheduled to be released in High Definition. But they will only be available in a gorgeously-designed glossy 9-DVD Box Set, with all of the films (special editions), extras. Maybe it will have the original Star Wars illustration of Darth Vader across the box -- and it will be something around $200 list, $140 on Amazon.<br /><br />Then once again people will voice their fury at Lucasfilm's arrogance. We will be stuck with Hayden Christansen digitally inserted into the finale of Return of the Jedi, a ridiculous CGI Jabba, the slobbering Max Reebo band, and everything else we detest.<br /><br />Then in about 2010 an ageing Lucas will relent, say he has listened to all the hearfelt pleas, and to much ballyhoo announce that yes he will indeed be releasing the original versions, and yes, because he cares so much, he will even clean them up and release them properly. He will be a compassionate hero while at the same time make umpteen millions more.<br /><br />Don't give this guy any more money. What he has done here is shameless and rude to the original fanbase. Non-anamorphic tranfers in this day and age is ridiculous.<br /><br />FOLLOW-UP: Well, it took a little longer than anticipated, but this scenario has unfolded almost exactly as I described above. However, even I could not have envisioned that Lucas would feather the nest with a couple of coffee table books on the making of "Star Wars" & "The Empire Strikes Back", in addition to dangling the rotten carrot of pointless deleted scenes before his abused fan base. Unbelievable. 2011 will see the final massive influx of cash into the Lucasfilm coffers from the DVD / Blu-Ray market, and then it's on to the next lucrative iteration: 3D theatrical re-re-re-release. 11/13/2010</p></body></html>

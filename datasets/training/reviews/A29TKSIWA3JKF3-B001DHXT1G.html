<meta name="summary" content="When angry, not much to like"></head><body><p>This movie takes an awful lot for granted, like assuming that everyone is already well acquainted with the Hulk before they started to watch this version.  The flashback reminders that zip through the opening credits don't help.  They never paused long enough to jar one's memory or give a boost to someone who has absolutely no idea who or what the Hulk is and why it's dangerous to make him angry.<br />Never mind, sorry, no time to pause... before you know it, ready or not, new story, new locale, new actor, brief homage to Bill Bixby and a walk-on by Lou Ferrigno, and we're off.<br />Why is he in Brazil of all places?  I know he's hiding out and all that, but still, Brazil?  It's not as if he wasn't easily found there.  I'd also like to know exactly where he lost his personality, Mexico?  Did they hire Edward Norton only because he sufficiently looked the part of a scientist/geek?  Or did they want someone so invisible that when the Hulk appears he really stands out?  And why was Tim Roth in this movie?  Anyone could have played that part, a stand-in even.  Was he hired for his lack of height?  As for William Hurt (I don't care if he did win an Oscar several decades ago), he only comes across as ruthless because they wrote him that way; he brings absolutely no menace to the part on his own.  Come to think on it, the only good parts in this movie were the three action sequences set so far apart I almost fell asleep waiting for them.  Each one an ambush; how many times can you ambush this guy before it figures it out, which he didn't, so I guess the answer is: he's a sucker for a good or bad ambush every time!  And this guy was supposed to be a brilliant scientist!  Hello!  He had enough sense not to use credit cards or cell phones yet he sends an email that's easily traced!?  Now that's congenitally stupid.<br />This, for me, was an extremely frustrating movie (the very end only made it worse).  I hope there's not a 3rd attempt to get the green guy right.<br />(I had a hunch I wasn't going to like this movie, which explains why I stalled so long before watching it.  And no, it's not a keeper.)</p></body></html>

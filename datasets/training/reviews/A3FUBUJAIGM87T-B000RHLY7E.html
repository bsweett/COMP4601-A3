<meta name="summary" content="0 STARS: Please reject this kind of garbage.  It sucks!!!!"></head><body><p>In the past, I have been asked to soften my stance on this kind of garbage, but I refuse as I will always tell it like it is.  Movies like "The Devil's Wussies", I mean, "The Devil's Rejects" are the kind of movies that are embarrassing for the horror genre.  This movie would make me laugh if I wasn't so disgusted with boredom and the movie's inherent stupidity!!  This movie is simply garbage and is a boring waste of time.  It's not scary, there's no substance, there's no style, there's no suspense, and it's just a bunch of stupid moronic nonsense that is totally uncompelling and very much indicative of a lack of imagination on the part of Rob Dumbie, I mean Rob Zombie...added to which indignity, I heard this guy Zombie is doing a remake of the all-time classic "Halloween"...what a sad day that will be for the horror genre.  Oh, just let me run to my video store and buy "The Devil's Rejects" and place it right along side classics like "The Shining", "The Exorcist", "The Omen", The original "TCM", and "Halloween"...pleeeaase!! I'm glad I just rented this garbage.  "The Devil's Rejects" is nothing but trash, plain and simple.</p></body></html>

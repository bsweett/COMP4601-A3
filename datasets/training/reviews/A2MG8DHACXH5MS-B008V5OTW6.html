The 1972 Olympics were marked by the assassination of 12 Israeli athletes while the world watched on TV. Munich is what Israel did in response to the trauma. As the film goes on it become more unclear who is right in the struggle. In the end it leaves a question ... hate only begets hate, only love can quash hate. Is that what Spielberg is saying?</p></body></html>

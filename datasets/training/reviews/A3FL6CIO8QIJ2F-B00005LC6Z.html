<meta name="summary" content=""Good Sequel to a Classic""></head><body><p>I just viewed "Halloween 2" last night and I have to say it is a surprisingly good sequel to the 1978 classic. The film was released in 1981 and takes place on the same night as the original (October 3, 1978) and continues the story. Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is brought to the local hospital where she is recovering from wounds caused by the maniacal Michael Myers. There he tracks her down to finish what he started and as a result a series of murders takes place.<br /><br /> To me what was exceptionally inventive is the reason Michael wants to kill Laurie and it is revealed about half-way through the film.<br /><br /> On a paltry $2.5 million budget "Halloween 2" grossed a very impressive $26,000,000 and fans simply loved it. My only problem with the movie was Jamie Lee's wardrobe. LOL.<br /><br /> This was to be the franchise's final film, but due to impressive box office sales other sequels and movies were made that should never have been.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="FRANCIS LAWRENCE, OPUS 2"></head><body><p>***** 2007. Based on Richard Matheson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765318741">I Am Legend</a> and directed by Francis Lawrence. Dr. Robert Neville is the sole survivor of a pandemic that started in NYC. For three years now, he has tried to find an antidote to the virus at night while infected people are haunting the city. I'm fed up with these reviewers who consider that this film is bad because it doesn't do justice to Richard Matheson book. When Van Gogh paints a face in green or orange, you don't say that his painting is not good because the face's color is not the model's, do you ? After the already very good <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009MDPYM">Constantine (Widescreen Edition)</a>, Francis Lawrence prooves with I AM LEGEND that he's a real filmmaker one will have to count with in the future. His film is simply the best science-fiction film since Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMA8">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>. Masterpiece.</p></body></html>

This is the first of (currently) three books in the Robert Langdon series. Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a specialist in symbology (the history and meaning of various symbols from different cultures. Langdon is called to help the police in Paris with a murder. This starts a long chain of events in which various religious factions are chasing "the Holy Grail". Langdon gains the help of a police officer who is the daughter of the murder victim. As the complex puzzle grows, Langdon reaches out for help from an old friend. This chain of events has several surprises as we learn some people are not who they appear to be (e.g. the lead police detective is actually a member of one of the religious factions and is trying to frame Langdon for the murder). Even Langdon's old friend is not exactly who he appears, nor is his butler! Complex, interesting, exciting and compelling is this story. Langdon is no James Bond, but, he does well during action moments. Langdon somewhat reminds me of Indiana Jones; college profession who has interesting adventures with historical artifacts and legends.<br /><br />A shout-out to Ron Howard for outstanding Direction of this movie! I feel the movie was totally faithful to the book. The last 5 minutes of the movie is totally wonderful (from Langdon's shaving accident). I can watch it over and over. On the Blu-Ray, there are details on how this scene was created. Simply Wow!<br /><br />Much has been written and debated over the historical validity of Brown's story and assertions. If you set aside those various debates and opinions and just take it as a story of fiction, it is a very good movie! I highly recommend this movie!</p></body></html>

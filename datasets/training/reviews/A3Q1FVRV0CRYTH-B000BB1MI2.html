<meta name="summary" content="Even better than the original"></head><body><p>I personally was siked about seeing this movie.  I couldn't wait, because as a kid I loved watching the original with Gene Wilder.  So I drug my wife who wasn't so thrilled and her kid-brother to the movies.  I personally loved this movie, beggining to end.  I thought that it was beautifully shot, complettly draws you into each frame, and although I had read numerous reviews that mentioned Depps performance to be 'over the top' and very 'jackson-ish' I thought he was perfect.  He really made the film enjoyable.  He may have been a little creepy and or corny at times, but thats what made it so great.  Johnny Depp is one of those great entertainers, like Crowe, who is never the same.  They completly morph into a charactor and thats what Depp did here.  Another rising star is young Freddie Highmore who played Charlie.  He is the next Haley-Joel Osmand I guerenty it.  Maybe this time the kid won't dissapear after he hits puberty.  Anyways, the movie was a refreshing taste of holliwood, a great little escape into the weird and yet complete fun.  Tim Burton will get an oscar nod I'm almost sure of it, and for that he deserves it as well as little Highmore...be nice to see him get recognition as well.  Anyways...see this movie..you will be pleased, I promise.</p></body></html>

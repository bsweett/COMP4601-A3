<meta name="summary" content="Derailed, indeed. *SPOILERS*"></head><body><p>The critics disliked this film, and I heard that it was horrible, even one of the worst films of 2005, so I avoided this film when it was in cinemas. However, before I seen this film, I believed (and still do believe) that Clive Owen is an actor who can give a great performance, just watch Mike Nichols' "Closer" (one of the best films of 2004, in my opinion) to see how great of a performance he can give. Jennifer Aniston, on the other hand, had yet to impress me with her "same character" performances.<br /><br />"Derailed" is about a man, Charles (Owen) and a woman, Lucinda (Aniston) who are both married, who meet on a train, and eventually fall in love with each other. So they wind up in a hotel, and decide to get a room, and then they begin to have an affair with each other. Soon after they get a room, they're interrupted by the bad guy, a french villian named Philippe (Vincent Cassel) who kick's Charles' butt, steals Charles' wallet, and leaves him unconscious, and then he decides to rape Lucinda. He decides to blackmail Charles, and Charles decides that the only way he can stop the bad guy from terrorizing him and his family, as well as keeping his affair a secret is by giving into Philippe's demands.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Jennifer Aniston has attempted to climb out of her "Friends character" shell, finally.<br />-Those looking for a great popcorn movie, plenty of action, or violence will most likely be satisfied.<br />-Excellent performances from Clive Owen and Vincent Cassel.<br />-The rap stars performances in this film DO NOT RUIN THE MOVIE (for once).<br />-Plenty of plot twists.<br />-Good character development (especially Aniston's character).<br />-You'll be cheering Clive Owen's character on in the last half hour of the film (and trust me, it's worth seeing).<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The film's adverts practically give away the plot twists, so when you watch the film, you most likely know what is going to happen BEFORE it happens!<br />-The film is too predictable, and if you want to enjoy most of the plot twists, chances are, you'll have to leave your brain at the door.<br />-Jennifer Aniston's performance in the movie was somewhat difficult to believe, I felt like she was miscast.<br />-Clive Owen looked like he could kick the french villian's butt at anytime, but instead, his character took all of the punches.<br />-This movie would've been over in 15 minutes if Owen's character had a spine and common sense.<br />-I couldn't believe all of the stuff Owen's character lets the bad guy get away with.<br />-All Owen's character did around the bad guy was whimper and exclaim, "Take all my money, please don't kill me". COME ON! It's CLIVE OWEN! He was NOMINATED for the James Bond role!<br />-This film has plot holes out the wazoo!<br />-Before seeing the movie, I already knew who the bad guys were.<br /><br />I advise those who expect to see a ground-breaking thriller to avoid this film, because chances are, they'll be disappointed. If you're a fan of Clive Owen or Jennifer Aniston, popcorn action flicks, or a thriller film aficionado, this is worth at least a rental. Two stars for the excellent acting by most of the lead cast, and the "keeps you on the edge of your seat" ending.</p></body></html>

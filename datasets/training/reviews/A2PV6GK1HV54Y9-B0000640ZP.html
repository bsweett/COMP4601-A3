The film stars Nicole Kidman, she should have received an oscar nomination for her fearless performance instead of Moulin Rouge. She is absolutely spellbinding as an isolated mother who's husband is off in war and her two small adorable children suffer from a disease which makes them photo sensitive to light. Grace (Kidman) is a religious woman but she is torn between her life and her will to live. Gorgeously directed, terrific acting from the entire cast, The Others has to be the one of the best horror movies in the last decade. I loved every frame, every scene, every camera trick, if you are not a fan of Kidman's, you will be after you watch The Others.</p></body></html>

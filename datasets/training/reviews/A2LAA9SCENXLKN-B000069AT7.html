Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />What an awesome movie. Steven Spielberg and John Williams of course are the big names, but everyone played a fantastic part in this film. But lemme say, John Williams has been with Steven Spielberg most of the way through. I'll just name a few, Jaws, Indiana Jones, E.T., Jurassic Park, and Spielberg was offered to do Superman and didn't take it. But John took the job, I guess it just felt right. Now, more onto E.T. I like how they gradually revel E.T., just enough for your soul to feel just right. I mean, Steven really knows how to play with your sole, and that makes him one of the best filmmakers in all the times.<br /><br />Speaking of which, the Cinematography in this film is fantastic. The shots are just incredible! You don't get those natural panoramic views today. Just 360 shots. Blaugh. The humor in E.T. is great and light hearted, just pure. No $3Xual jokes or violence needed for the laughing, just light hearted humor everyone can get around. I find that in Spielberg movies, and Ghostbusters. The special effects are just completely amazing, HOW DID THEY DO THAT IN 1982??? I didn't think they used CGI in live action at the time. Yet, they also capture your imagination. I know I sound paid off (oh, hello Spielberg...) No, I'm just joking around. The animals are a good addition but I feel as if they were mistreated.<br /><br />Cliches do exist, however, they fit in nicely in the film. Another feature similar to Indiana Jones. But here, it's family cliche, where in Indy it's action cliche. Jurassic Park has Sci-Fi cliche, Jaws has horror cliche, gosh, Spielberg likes cliches. E.T. also has a great personality, you can totally get around this guy. He's just perfect for the role, he's so awesome. And speaking of which, I love how gradually he is able to learn both together with friends and on his own. It just shows they didn't sham a family movie, and really put some personality in this character. The child actors are fantastic, this beats Goonies. I have never seen children act with such character and feelings. It just shows what. They are free and well spirited.<br /><br />There is a fake kids show in the film that helps E.T. talk, but the text on it is disturbing. Oh well, minor quibble. Minor complement, I also love E.T.'s voice, it's just so classic. You know, I've waited WAY too long to see this amazing film. The characters are wonderful, they all represent a different part of society. The inexperienced, intermediate, experienced but naive, elder, corrupt, pure, and of course, foreign. It just fits perfectly into such a wonderful film. Just a perfectly pure and clever film. Better than some of the junk put out these days. Oh and, of course, the Halloween scene has to be talked about. No way could anybody ever make a costume so simple yet so clever. Meaning, all you haft to do is put a sheet over your head to dress up like E.T. Pure genius.<br /><br />Honestly, I feel the bike scene might be overrated. But, I waited to long to see this film, maybe my brain has been to synthesized. That's something I gotta live with. I also have seen but no memory of Spider-Man. But, that's nothing like waiting to see E.T. The psychological aspect of this film is original and genius, the ability to feel other feelings. That's AMAZING! No thinking other thoughts, Spielberg was able to THINK in the way I am. Feel other feelings, that's correct and amazing. Beautiful. This movie isn't afraid to rip your heart out, or put your heart back in. It makes you feel extremely deeply.<br /><br />"Hey, who are you?" "I'm driving." Awesome line, that goes in the line of fame. Such a beautiful film.<br /><br />I rate it, 5.3/5</p></body></html>

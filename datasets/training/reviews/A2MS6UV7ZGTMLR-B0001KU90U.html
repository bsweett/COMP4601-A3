He's been through the American Civil War and also fought against Native Indians in a murderous little war.<br /><br />He drinks to crush the horrible memories, but even that is failing to calm his tortured spirit.<br /><br />With little to keep him in America, he joins a semi-official mercenary force that goes to Japan to help the pro-West government put down a samuari backlash<br /><br />You'd think the new imperial army - armed with rifles and cannon - would be able to easily crush the sword-wielding warriors, but in his first encounter with samurai Algren's green troops are wiped out and he is captured.<br /><br />He survives and is taken to the last samurai warlord Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) who wants to learn about the West "to know his enemies better".<br /><br />Initially reviled by the Japanese, Algren too is learning from his enemies and begins to appreciate their view on life and honour. When it comes time for his release he realises that perhaps the modern way is no longer his to follow.<br /><br />That pretty much sums up the basic storyline of The Last Samurai and while it can be compared with Dances With Wolves, it is more action filled.<br /><br />The fight scenes are superb and the battle scenes will have you on the edge of the couch.<br /><br />The characters are believable and throughout the movie you will form attachments to them.<br /><br />Cruise is at his best, while Ken Watanabe is sensational as the samurai fighting for his country's traditions and values. Timothy Spall also plays a wonderful role as a former British diplomat turned photographer.<br /><br />The Last Samurai is excellent viewing and will appeal to those who like beautiful photography, a good storyline and terrific battle scenes.</p></body></html>

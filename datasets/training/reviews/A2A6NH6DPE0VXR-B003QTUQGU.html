<meta name="summary" content="One of Burton's Best, I Think"></head><body><p>An older Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to Wonderland after escaping a planned engagement party, that was planned by everyone but her. While in Wonderland, the white rabbit thinks he might have lured the wrong Alice into the Rabbit's hole. But the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) believes she's the real Alice and that she's the chosen one to bring down the Red Queen (Helen Bohen Carter). The Red Queen stole the thrown from her good sister, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and has forced everyone to worship her.<br /><br />  I like that it's not an unnecessary remake, we have had the same story done over and over again enough times. The movie is fun with a brilliant cast. Burton does his most imaginative work even if we didn't really need a big fight between good and evil in an Alice and Wonderland movie. All of that felt like a combination of Narnia and Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />  I've seen some reviews where dumb critics say Depp was the only good thing about the movie. He was good, but I don't think it was his best work. I don't know why his Mad Hatter had accent on and off that makes him sound like a leprechaun. Hell, he even occasionally sounded a lot like BeetleJuice. Other than that, he was perfect in the role. However, the film would be less effective if Wasikowska wasn't cast as Alice. She's a real find and was excellent as Alice, she was possibly even the best I've seen. I'd love to see a Burton remake of the Wizard of Oz, but only if he doesn't think the Wizard of Oz would need an big epic battle between good and evil. It would also be nice to get a break from Depp and Helen Bohen Carter in everything he does. We don't need Carter as the Wicked Witch and Depp as the Scare Crow.</p></body></html>

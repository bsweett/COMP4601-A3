<meta name="summary" content="The dinosaurs saved the movie"></head><body><p>I can't remember looking forward to a movie more than &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; after having read the book umpteen times.  The movie does some justice to the book, and should have done a lot more.  The acting is adequate; the casting ranges from good to awful (I liked Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm but Sam Neill was not, and is not, Alan Grant, and Laura Dern was terrible as Ellie Sattler), and the plot changes were unneccessary and detract from the story.  There was no need to make Ellie Grant's girlfriend; there's not enough fire between them to generate any interest; and the movie tried to take P.C. too far with the children and transformed the nerdy older boy and the bratty younger girl (she was so obnoxious in the book I wanted to feed her to a raptor) into the computer whiz older sister with a whiny little brother.  If it weren't for the dinosaurs, the movie would be a washout.  But the dinosaurs save the day.  The computer effects are so breathtaking that one wants to drop the popcorn and gasp, good goshamighty, those are REAL DINOSAURS!!  The dinosaurs, in fact, have more personality than the people.  The tyrannosaurus is the tough guy on the block and the raptors are the boyz in the hood, lean mean killing machines.  I would have liked to see some more plant-eaters (a stegosaur or two would have been nice) but what there was, was terrific -- the gallimimus stampede is so real it makes you want to duck down in your seat, and there's a hilarious spot when the girl goes &quot;kitchy-koo&quot; to a brachiosaurus, and the reptile responds by saying &quot;achoo&quot; and spraying a gallon of brachioboogers into her face.  The movie's ending is far more upbeat than the book, anticipating &quot;Jurassic Park 2&quot;, and the dark undertone of the book, that playing God is one of man's worst mistakes, somehow doesn't come across as strongly in the film.  But the dinosaurs are a miracle in themselves, and make the movie the ultimate fun ride it is.</p></body></html>

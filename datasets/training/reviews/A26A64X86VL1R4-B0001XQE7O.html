<meta name="summary" content="&#65279;Beautiful cinematography and excellent casting"></head><body><p>&#65279;This is a story of a son's reconciliation with his father.  The plot device of using the fantastic<br /><br />tales of the father to illustrate the son's frustration with his father is well done.  I have a personal dislike for the use of freakish characters such as giants but this was actually well carried out with a Fellini-esque flair.  The acting and interrelation between<br /><br />characters were flawless.  Overall a good film that provides a heart-warming insight into human<br /><br />foibles.</p></body></html>

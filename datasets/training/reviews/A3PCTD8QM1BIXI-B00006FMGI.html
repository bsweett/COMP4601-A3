<meta name="summary" content="Piece Bronosan last go round as Bond is great"></head><body><p>Die Another Day is another great Bond flick. Piece Bronosan proves to me once again that he makes a great Bond. The action sequences are tight and not over blown like in Tommrow Never Dies. Halle Berry and Rosomund Pike are great as Bond girls but I really enjoyed Rick Yune as the bad guy. I hope we get to see more Yune in the future. As the creidts always say James Bond will return.</p></body></html>

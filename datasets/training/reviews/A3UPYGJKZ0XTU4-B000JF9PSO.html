But when I finally did sit down to watch this movie, I found it thoughtful and absorbing. British filmmaker Paul Greenberg wrote and directed "United 93" in a docudrama style that hasn't been employed this successfully in decades. He populated the film with real pilots, real flight attendants, real air traffic controllers, and real military professionals, some of them also actors, who lend authenticity to the recreations. The scenes in the air traffic control centers were filmed in real time, as the participants and actors reenacted the morning of September 11, 2001. Ben Sliney, who was in charge at the National Air Traffic Command Center that day, reprises his own role compellingly. The result is an extraordinary film that is at once riveting drama and an important contribution to the continually unfolding aftermath of 9/11.<br /><br />"United 93" recreates 1 hour and 51 minutes of the morning of September 11, 2001, much of it in real time -though the beginning of the film seems compressed, as passengers and flight crew arrive at the airport and board the plane. The action shifts between United Airlines Flight 93, the National Air Traffic Command Center in Herndon, VA, the air traffic control towers in Boston, New York, and Cleveland, and the Northeast Air Defense Center (NORAD) in Rome, New York. The first hour gives us an inside look at air traffic and military professionals as they struggle to understand what is going on and implement some sort of response. The film demonstrates an acute awareness of the systems on which our modern world depend and the fragility that became apparent when a group of determined individuals decided to assault our modernity.<br /><br />No one knows precisely what went on on United Flight 93. Paul Greenberg assumed the delicate job of creating "a believable truth" for an event that is deeply steeped in politics and mythology. Greenberg was up to the task, and "United 93" could not be better. Sensitive without melodrama, suspenseful instead of sensational, reflective but not passive, "United 93" fulfills the need to understand and memorialize the events of September 11, 2001, for the families of the deceased, for Americans of all political stripes, and for a culture that still struggles to put these events in context and to decipher their implications. That's a tall order, and I could not praise "United 93" more highly for delivering on it.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2006 single disc): In "United 93: The Families and the Film" (1 hour), some families of passengers who perished on United 93 talk about their loved ones and meet the actors who play their family members in the movie. "Memorial Pages" (text) are a list of the 30 passengers and crew who died on United Flight 93 with a bio of each. "Twin Towers" (2 min) is a promotion of a short documentary about 2 brothers, one policeman and one firefighter, who responded to the World Trade Center on 9/11. The audio commentary by Paul Greenberg is thoughtful and worthwhile, especially the first half. The second half is a bit repetitive. He talks about the film's structure, what he left out and why, technical challenges, and comments a great deal on the film's ideas. He unfortunately doesn't say which parts of the action on board Flight 93 is fact and what was extrapolated. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, French, Spanish. Dubbing is available in French, Spanish. DVS is available for the visually impaired.</p></body></html>

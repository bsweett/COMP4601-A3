The movie isn't that scary but it's a lot scarrirer than most horror movies. Sissy Spacek gives a great performance as a very unique girl named Carrie who has psychic powers. She isn't popular and is always mocked by people but always keeps her powers under restraint. Her mother is very creepy and is a complete nutcase that locks her in the closet at times. Well, you know what's going to happen, something's going to drive Carrie absolutely nuts. And you won't believe what she does. I don't want to give away anything but believe the mom is freaky. John Travolta gives a good performance as one of the popualr kids in school. I recommend to be aware at the end of the movie or else you might jump off the couch like I did.(It's not over until the credits, believe me)</p></body></html>

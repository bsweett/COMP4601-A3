<meta name="summary" content="Great Odin's Raven, this is funny (3.5 stars)!"></head><body><p>Anchorman isn't much like the typical Hollywood comedy these days, but those who have seen enough of such comedies should realize that's definitely a good thing.  It's not quite a classic, but it's a silly, perverse, and occasionally surreal adult farce that effectively exploits the same formula that made Caddyshack a favorite among young guys everywhere: twisted characters, oddball dialogue, and a few lowbrow gags to keep everyone loose.  Even more importantly, it doesn't try too hard or wear out its welcome (having sat through Wedding Crashers in the theatre, I can attest that mainstream comedies shouldn't run past 100 minutes; this one clocks in at a highly palatable 90), and even the unrated DVD cut doesn't pile on gross-outs just because it can.  In other words, it's a lighthearted, funny, frequently inspired flick, which on its own makes Anchorman a success by the standards of the past few years.<br /><br />Set in late 1970's San Diego, Anchorman scores some major points with its comedic take on the rapid social changes of the time and the inhernet vacuity of the news anchor's job.  The cast is surprisingly good, led by a brilliantly over-the-top performance from Ferrell (whom I could normally take or leave) in the lead role of Ron Burgundy and the constant scene-stealing of the great Steve Carrell as dim-witted weatherman Brick Tamland.  There are plenty of mock-serious poses to go around, and some hysterical physical comedy led by Ferrell's bizarre turn playing jazz flute (check out those flames!).  Hell, Ron Burgundy's mustache is a great running joke in and of itself.<br /><br />The movie doesn't seem to have many aspirations beyond just being really goofy, but to be fair, it accomplishes that task extremely well most of the time.  Anchorman is at its best in its first half, when it revels in the excesses and political incorrectness of late '70's and pokes fun at them at the same time.  Not to mention, it's a goldline for memorable lines (in fact, Bill Simmons, aka the Sports Guy of [...] fame, used quotes from this movie for this year's NFL preview).  Here's a sampling of some of the classic lines from the first half-hour alone, not counting a few that I can't repeat:<br /><br />"Years later, a doctor will tell me I have an IQ of 48 and I'm what some people call mentally retarded."<br /><br />"I'm very important...I have many leatherbound books...my apartment smells of mahogany...I'm friends with Merlin Olsen."<br /><br />"I could be wrong, but I believe diversity's an old, old wooden ship that was used during the Civil War era."<br /><br />"It is anchor MAN, not anchor LADY, and that's a scientific fact."<br /><br />"I will smash your face into a car windshield and then take your mother, Dorothy Mantooth, out for a nice seafood dinner and NEVER CALL HER AGAIN!"<br /><br />"You know how to cut to the core of me, Baxter...you're so wise...you're like a miniature Buddha with hair."<br /><br />"I have very little time to get to the gym, so I have to sculpt my guns at the office."<br /><br />Unfortunately (even though I sort of saw it coming) Anchorman does lose a bit of steam after the halfway mark, although there are still some great bits of slapstick to be found: Jack Black's dog-punting cameo (an instantly memorable scene if ever there was one); the five-news team brawl, and the knock-down-drag-out fight between Ron and Veronica Corningstone chief among them.  Still, Anchorman manages to generate plenty of laughs and goodwill in its brief running time.  It's certainly not as nuanced and intelligent as, say, Sideways, but then I don't think it's supposed to be.  What it is supposed to be is a nice little piece of goofballery, which it very much winds up being.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What is war?"></head><body><p>I have picked this movie after learning about it during 2009 Oscar selection.  I was happy for the first woman director, Kathryn Bigelow, who has received and Oscar for her film.  In spite of the fact that there are no big name actors in this movie (except for one), it is the story of the film and the art of making it that sears into the nerve about the war, soldiering and brotherhood in combat.<br /><br />It has been a while since I have seen a good war film.  And this one goes hand in hand with the best ones. It is insightful anf it attacks all aspects of what it means to be a professional soldier.  Main character is complicated - if not reckless, then he is totally oblivious about the effect he has on people working with him.  Is it the need for rush that keep him going or is it something else?  I will let you watch the movie in order to be a judge of that.<br /><br />The absolute credit goes to director Bigelow and the screenwriter of the film.  This is a smart film that will not take sides, judge people and their actions - it acts as observe of the reality taht at times seems mesmerizing and tantalizing at the same time.  I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Day the Earth Stood Still 3 disc Blu-ray"></head><body><p>It's amazing movie and i liked so much. Even remake but still look good. Transfer Auido and Picture very amazing than DVD. It's contains 3 disc .. 1 disc remake disc 2 digital copy and 3 old version. But it's upset because old version don't have feature at all. because if the distubutor want can insert the feature in disc 3 because i think more space in blu-ray disc. to bad .. but it's great to have edition because i buy very cheap. thanks amazon</p></body></html>

I expected this to be good, but a running time of 2hrs 37mins was a black mark in my book before I'd seen a frame. However it is another classic, not as great a film as Schindlers List, but in many ways as moral a tale, but on a smaller scale.<br /><br />How accurate the film is I have no idea, however the opening credits say "inspired by true events" and the killing of 11 Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village in 1972 did happen and I don't think there is any doubt that revenge in one form or another was sort. In some ways the filmmaking style harks back to the 1970's as well. There is a gritty realism reminisent of the French Connection films here and you won't find a modern "high octane" thriller here (usually film advertised with that phrase are awful).<br /><br />Eric Bana plays Avner, one of five chosen to find and kill the people who planned the attack. As the film progresses we see the doubts creep into Avner's mind about what he's doing. In fact in essence the message of this movie is "killing people f**ks you up". The only reason it won't is if you are either already a religious extremist or a complete psychotic. The performances are all good and the rest of the cast is very strong. As well as Bana there is Daniel Craig and Geoffery Rush.<br /><br />This is an intelligent film that asks some serious questions about an eye for an eye etc, but don't let that put you off. It is still a cracking good thriller and Spielberg once again shows why he is the most successful director in the history of cinema, as well as being one the most talented as well (success and talent do not always go together!).</p></body></html>

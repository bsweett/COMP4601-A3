<meta name="summary" content="The Illusion Seems Limp"></head><body><p>THE PRESTIGE (dir. Christopher Nolan, 2006) refers to the final climax of a magic trick/stage illusion, according to this film. Not being a magician but a real amateur fan of magic and magicians, I have to say I have never heard of such terminology. I recall Houdini referring to "illusions", "tricks" and he even called himself a fraud several times. However, no "prestige".<br /><br />In this film, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play warring stage illusionists with a mutual history. This involves the death of Jackamn's wife, which he naturally blames on Bale for good reason. What annoyed me about this film is something I believe no director has ever used properly: the reading-from-a-journal narrative.<br /><br />Both Bale and Jackman, at differing points in time, read each other's diaries, thus learning each other's secrets. The big one they each want is the other's 'disappearing act'. Jackman wants to know what Bale did to cause the accident, in fact, which he may or may not learn at the end. Of course, Bale only learns Jackman's secret at the end, and we ALL have to wait til the end. I admit, it is clever, though obvious.<br /><br />As I said, it's just plain annoying and not because of the wait. While I applaud this film in all its powerful efforts, including a brilliant-as-usual turn by David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, it is a bit long at two hours and sags with a huge yawn. This is mainly because we have to wait for the journal-reading narrative to play out; the disconcerting back-and-forth along this complex storyline is a pain. The only reason I saw this was to see Bowie as Tesla, one of my heroes! He, at least, does not disappoint. He even nailed the Serbian accent on the head.<br /><br />It is a good idea to compare Nolan's basic premise with the premises of other past films - films that are immortal, incomparable and are pillars of established film history.<br /><br />In Kurosawa's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BEK8E2">Rashomon</a>, we have a crime that is shown to the viewer but we are also shown the perceptions of five separate witnesses; so, what actually happened? It is brilliant, confusing, metaphysically challenging. THIS is a magic trick the audience can never forget.<br /><br />In his lesser-known <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00180R072">High and Low (The Criterion Collection)</a>, we have a kidnapping gone awry: the wrong kid is taken, and we are shown that fact fairly soon. The trick here is whether the other child will live and be saved. Again, brilliant, clear and no tricks played on us but the tension in itself is a trick.<br /><br />In the fantastic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXZ4">Memento</a>, a crime is committed resulting in the victim developing an odd form of persistent amnesia. He can only remember things for 10 minutes, after which he suffers total amnesia. This is a real condition, and we watch as the film tracks backward through time to tell us how it all came to this. The entire film is like watching a marvelous stage illusion because that is what the plot and storyline really are.<br /><br />In the wonderful and underestimated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AF5UQS">Vantage Point</a>, which was inspired by the Zapruder Film of JFK's assassination, we see an assassination attempt, but we also miss a great deal. As the film progresses, we are shown things, little things we actually saw earlier but this time around, they are actually explained. It's as if the viewer is the detective, seeing the answers unfold in a proper narrative ... something we did not get to see at the start. That is the delight: the trick was we started out thinking we'd never get it. The payoff is that we finally do get it: hence "VANTAGE POINT".<br /><br />In the more recent sci-fi thriller <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007N1JC8">Primer</a> (see my review), several young physicists create a time machine. Though it has limited capabilities to send people into the recent past, the scientists make a horrid mistake - then a horrible discovery as they travel back in time repeatedly. They discover that they are leaving "past" versions of themselves running free, and at one point consider killing them all. The viewer, who is watching an objective narrative, actually begins to wonder if it is all a trick or what.<br /><br />Compared to these, THE PRESTIGE utterly fails. You will note, each film I suggested to you above has its payoff, and one does not have to bust open one's head to understand what's being shown. In other words, to borrow Hitchcock's term, in the great films, we 'get' the MacGuffin even if we have to wait a bit. Hitchcock never made the audience wait: he made the characters wait.<br /><br />Nolan, on the other hand, is doing something that viewers generally hate: playing tricks on us without ever really letting us in, thus no real payoff awaits us. It is plain the viewer can barely work out what happened and what didn't, and that is unfair. It is bad filmmaking.<br /><br />Apropos of the preceding, THE PRESTIGE truly insults the wonderful, hard work of Tesla, and the work of magicians everywhere. It also insults movie-making. It certainly insults the audience. My wife, who is a genius, a teacher and a polymath, says she hates films like this. "I don't want to have a stroke trying to decipher a film. I watch a film TO HAVE THINGS SHOWN AND EXPLAINED TO ME." Her own verbatim loud and insistent words. To a degree, I agree, my dear.<br /><br />Michael Caine and Andy Serkis are stellar and well worth seeing, the era portrayed has a convincing feel which is not easy to convey. The rest I leave to you to judge. This film is not real magic. It is a con game, and we are the suckers.<br /><br />UPDATED DISCLAIMER: Originally I did not address Telsa's machine; in a more recent disclaimer, I said it was obvious Tesla had invented a teleportation machine that did not function. Whether this was supposed to be an unworthy trick by Tesla, or simply a rotten lazy trick by director Nolan, it is still insulting and unfair to Tesla's good name. In Nolan's defense, I think he proved in his film that Tesla did indeed invent a cloning machine. That, I think, was Nolan's ultimate trick on the audience.<br /><br />Yet it was all remarkably blurred, in a way that leaves the audience to decide what's what. Make your own decision about what Tesla did and did not do. As for me, the film shows one thing objectively: Tesla invented one hell of a lightning machine for the era, no matter what else you think. Just recall at the end of the film, who would think of replicating a living being? And why would Tesla bother himself with inventing magic tricks? Think about it before you impose your 21st-century judgment on the storyline.<br /><br />Think of the following: 1. Angier fooled Cutter (Michael Caine) with his demonstration of the machine and never let Cutter backstage to see it work; 2. Despite what inattentive fans claim, ALL sequences showing cloning were OBJECTIVE, not read in any journals but recounted by Angier to Borden just after Borden shot him; 3. Fans say Angier who was really Lord Caldlow simply murdered his double, except Borden, being an identical twin, could sniff out the double from a mile away; 4. Cutter, at some stage during Borden's trial, tells the judge that the Tesla machine is "real", thus testifying that whatever it is supposed to do, it really does.<br /><br />It's all sloppy, I know, but WE are left to put two and two together.<br /><br />And remember what Nolan himself said: Tesla invented weird things we still can't explain. Jackman said the film doesn't make sense, and Bale said you have to see it twice to fully get it. Christopher Priest, author of the original novel, stated up front that Tesla was vital to the story because of his ultimate invention of a machine.</p></body></html>

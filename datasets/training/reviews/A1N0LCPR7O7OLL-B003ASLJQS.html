This better sweep at the Oscars.  This is now one of my new favorite films.  I was particularly surprised with how strong Lawrence Fishburne and Kevin Bacon were in the film.  I loved their scenes together.  The teens/kids (i.e. Brendan) were terrific and turned in stunning performances.</p></body></html>

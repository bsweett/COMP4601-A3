How did this get made?"></head><body><p>TAKEN (2008) Directed by Pierre Morel.<br /><br /> Starring Liam Neeson and Famke Janssen.<br /><br /> When a group of Paris based Muslim Barbarian White Slavers kidnap the daughter of a former secret agent of the US govt, he gives them one chance to return her or he will kill them all. The Muslim Barbarians choose unwisely.<br /><br /> Some minor observations. It appears, based on this film, that the French are having second thoughts about allowing a horde of savages to take up residence in their country and yet the film portrays these same French being in league with said savages while the film's hero is an American who disregards the French, engages in genuine torture and generally leaves bodies in his wake. It appears the French have some issues to work out.<br /><br /> Other than the above, this is a simply wonderful and highly entertaining film, easily one of the best of 2008. Besides the fact that it is extremely well done in almost every respect from an emotionally charged script to a sold cast doing fine work, the film is also quite original and more than a little brave. Not only does it have Muslim Barbarians as villains but they are actually Muslim Barbarians acting LIKE Muslim Barbarians and not the Hug Me Elmos that Hollywood usually churns out. What is more.... this must be the first film about the horrific crime of White Slavery made since...When?? THE MONSTER AND THE GIRL in 1940??? If even half of what this film dramatizes is true then Hollywood should cut it out with the movies about Global Warming fantasies and all the rest of their rubbish and maybe consider a few more on this subject.<br /><br /> I was greatly impressed with Neeson's work here and have generally decided that the actor......whom I never liked much.......has truly become great as he has aged. The relationship with his ex-wife played by Janssen and especially his daughter is quite touching and real. The action and suspense are top notch and reminded at times of an old Republic serial. In spite of the violence and the horror of the subject matter, this is still a highly positive and ennobling film and left this viewer thoroughly pleased. The film even contrives to say a few kind words about Britney Spears/Jessica Simpson/Shakira albeit a fictionalized version!!<br /><br /> While 99.99 percent of modern films are really without worth, every now and then something reminiscent of how movies used to be slips through the cracks. This is such a film.<br /><br /> Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

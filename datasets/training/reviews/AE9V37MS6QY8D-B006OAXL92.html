<meta name="summary" content="To Scorsese: No. Just. No."></head><body><p>Sorry, Mr. Scorsese! This was a good, entertaining film. But worthy of an Academy Award? Nope. The beginning of the film was a bit off and slow; the plot really didn't pick up until about 40 minutes into the film. The best performance in the film was by Helen McCrory who portrays Mama Jeanne (Georges Melies' wife), but the others were decent. I feel like people (especially the Academy) are only crazy about this film because (1) it's Scorsese, and (2) it's about film history -- particularly honoring that history. There is no doubt that Melies was a visionary genius and his films are legendary, but this story and film of his involvement with a curious, orphaned boy sort of seems like something that should be made in the tradition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EPZ048">Mars Needs Moms</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AGTPUK">The Polar Express (Widescreen Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011NVC9I">Beowulf (Unrated Director's Cut)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NFM3JK">Disney's A Christmas Carol</a> -- those performance-captured computer graphic films.</p></body></html>

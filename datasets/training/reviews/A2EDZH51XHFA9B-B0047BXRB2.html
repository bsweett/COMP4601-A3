I've been following it, admittedly halfheartedly, on the IMDB fora for about a month now. And both sides have some very good points. From the standpoint of moviemaking, it does wear its B-movie origins on its sleeve. The acting is competent at best and mawkish most of the time. The direction isn't awful, but it's certainly nothing inspiring (though this can be said of most sci-fi films; Alien and Bladerunner are the exception, not the rule). The script, which borrows liberally from both Shakespeare and Asimov, sounds more like a dime novel than either of its supposed forebears. Still, I can't deny that all that pales in comparison to the atmosphere that Fred Wilcox (Lassie Come Home) and his crew cooked up for this movie.<br /><br />The plot: Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen in his second big-screen role) and his rather small crew have travelled to a planet where a colony had set down twenty years before, never to be heard from again. When they get there, they discover the colony's sole survivor, Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), and his beautiful daughter Altaira (Anne Francis). Unfortunately, they also discover something else-- the something else that killed the rest of the colonists.<br /><br />It's a pretty skinny plot, but you're not watching this movie for the plot. Much of what became standard, if not clich&eacute;, in the science fiction realm (thanks to the many knockoffs of this movie that followed, as well as the Twilight Zone television series, which reused many of the film's props and sets over the years) emerged here. And, yeah, a lot of it does look clich&eacute; now, especially if you're a big fan of Twilight Zone. But if you can think about it as a lot of tropes that had never, at the time, been seen before, you may be able to catch a glimpse of the magic here.  In fact, that so much of the film has become clich&eacute; in the ensuing four decades should tip you off to just how profoundly influential it's been. Couple that with the B-movie script-- and one thing you can say for B-movies, they were usually well-paced and fun, if shallow-- and the movie does still hold up very well after all this time. Bottom line, it's a lot of fun. ****</p></body></html>

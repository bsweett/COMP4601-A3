<meta name="summary" content="A surprisingly good adaptation"></head><body><p>Loosely based upon Isaac Asimov's story, Will Smith's I, Robot is good. I rarely have anything good to say about such adaptations but this detective story set in a future in which robots are commonplace is well-done and gripping. Although I think the key plotline of following "breadcrumbs," or deliberately set clues, could have been done better the special effects are for the most part impressive and believable. The acting was good and I was pleased to watch it.</p></body></html>

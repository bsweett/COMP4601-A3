<meta name="summary" content="The Unusual Suspects?"></head><body><p>Despite a capable cast and a clever premise, "Inside Man" didn't quite work for me.  Like "The Usual Suspects" (a far better movie, IMHO) "Inside Man' relies on a chopped-up timeline and after-the-fact interviews to divert your attention from the fact that, basically, the story it tells isn't really very plausible.  How does the leader of the "robbers" know about the damning evidence in the safe deposit box? How does Case know that THEY know? And aren't we past the time when former Nazi collaborators make convincing villains? Case must be at least 85!  When do we stop?  When they're 100, or 110?  Get some new bad guys, Hollywood!  3.5 stars.</p></body></html>

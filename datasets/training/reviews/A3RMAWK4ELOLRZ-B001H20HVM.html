<meta name="summary" content="Saw II"></head><body><p>Jigsaw is at it again in this sequel to the do-you-appreciate-your-life saga.  Five people are trapped in a house with no way out.  There is toxic fumes coming out of the vents, and these fumes are slowly killing the victims.  The antidote is around the house somewhere.  Like in the first movie, we find out a little something about each person there.  Meanwhile, a detective is looking for his son, who is in the house with the other four.<br /><br />This is bloodier than the first.  Is it better?  Maybe.  The ending will shock you as it did me.  From the sounds of it, there's going to be a Saw 3.<br /><br />Watch Saw 2 and judge for yourself.  I, personally, thought it was just ok.</p></body></html>

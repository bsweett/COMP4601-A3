<meta name="summary" content="As A Zombie O.K. But Also With Some Loopholes As Well"></head><body><p>This was one of the standard George Romero zombie movies with the usual shambling somewhat slow zombies that in the movie would eat living humans in very gory and bloody ways to satisfy any longtime zombie fan but some of the storyplot is pretty weak as well.  The one part I felt was a little weird was when you had the group of disgruntled scouts who when one of them is denied a position in the upper echelon of the cities important class decides to steal the armor vehicle and try and blackmail the leader of the isolated city into giving him money was  somewhat idiotic, yes for an isolated city surrounded by the walking undead there has to be some way to maintain a sense of trade an commerce between the living people in the city for certain possessions but come on.  I mean even if the people trying extort the money get away where are they going to go and spend the money on in a world almost completely taken over by the undead?  The acting from the main characters is very decent though and Dennis Hopper as always gives a great show in his movies but at the end it's pretty much what anyone who looks at the cover knows,  and that is it's a flesh-eating zombie movie for anyone who wants to see the blood and gore of people been eaten an the like but don't expect to much more from the movie itself such as a great storyline or the like...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A "D" effort for dull, draggy, and dumb"></head><body><p>This movie is slow, dull, and boring with injections of adrenalin to keep you from falling asleep.  Will Smith does a good job but good acting cannot salvage what is a poor screen play.  The deserted New York is very well done but the entire film drags plus it has some serious logical flaws.  Where are the bodies and/or skeletons?  If the surviors have resorted to cannabalism why are they only preying on the sole survior? Shouldn't some be starving? If they are eating abandoned food why are they attacking the one survivor?  If they are irrational and preying on humans why are they not attacking each other?  Where is the electricty coming from?  The first time he enters his safe house he hides his tracks but doesn't do that at any other time yet that is how he is tracked down.  Who set the trap for him?  That was left open -- why were cars used as counter weights when it would be easier to use something more easily handled?  Why was he constantly driving at high speeds?  Shooting a deer would have been easy yet he chose to chase them in his car -- why not run one down?  This whole sequence was contrived and sort of dumb.<br /><br />The film has long draggy sequences which were punctuated with attacks by over active zombies who appear to act irrationally and with no clear motive.  I watched this film with my sons, nephews, and grandsons -- none of them liked it and all of them thought we should have selected a different movie -- and I hardily agree.  This was a poor movie but the fault lies not the stars but in the screen play.  I would say don't bother with this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Suspenseful Thriller"></head><body><p>Lisa is certainly having a bad day. Returning from her grandmother's funeral she meets a man who seems quite likeable, but is really a villian. Lisa works as a manager at a hotel in Miami where the deputy secretary of homeland security and his family are taking a room. Our villian tells Lisa she is to help him put this man and his family in a position to be killed or her father will die.  What would you do?<br /><br />At first the movie is slow going as the plot is laid, but once this fiesty woman decides to fight back hold onto your hat.<br /><br />She's stuck between a rock and a hard place but is determined not to be the loser.  I felt this movie had a great story, really good acting and I loved the way it ended. A giggle after the suspense was icing on the cake.  I think you'll like this one and recommend you give it a try.</p></body></html>

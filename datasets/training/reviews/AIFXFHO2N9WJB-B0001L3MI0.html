The thought that maybe their might be some other forms of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is a concept that is both alluring and somewhat frightening at the same time, mostly because no one knows what the aliens (if they exist, which I don't believe they do) would be like. In the movies there are a few instances where aliens are depicted in a benevolent manner; examples would be films like, "E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial", "Men in Black" (the good aliens), and even the 'Star Trek' series at times. However, the majority of the time when aliens are featured in movies they are malevolent creatures bent on our destruction, such as; "Men in Black" (the bad aliens), "War of the Worlds", and "Mars Attacks". One of the most successful entries into the alien invasion sub-genre of science fiction would be the visual effects blockbuster "Independence Day" starring Will Smith, Bill Pullman, and Jeff Goldblum.<br /><br />"Independence Day" begins on a day when all seemed to be normal in the world and another run-of-the-mill 4th of July weekend was upon us. However, when giant saucers begin to fill the skies above numerous big cities across the globe, everything quickly shifts from average to extraordinary. As humanity attempts to contact what is believed to be aliens residing in these giant ships, one former scientist turned cable repairman (Jeff Goldblum) discovers that these aliens are anything but peaceful, and as he warns the President of the United States (Bill Pullman), the aliens strike with deadly force. Now, with the attempted annihilation of the human race in full swing, our last hope rests upon humanity's ability to work together in the face of adversity, and on a daring mission led by a cocky pilot (Will Smith).<br /><br />Here is a movie that beyond a shadow of a doubt, absolutely lives up to the term 'summer blockbuster'. What makes "Independence Day" such a great movie is not the fact that it is one of the best alien invasion movies ever made, of course that helps, but the mass appeal it has to such a wide audience. The film contains something for everyone; there's action, drama, romance, comedy, and of course, what would an alien invasion movie be without the prerequisite element of science fiction. All of those components when mixed together leaves audiences with an out of this world movie experience that they will undoubtedly want to enjoy time and again.<br /><br />The acting for "Independence Day" was completely solid throughout, which was a pleasant surprise given the material of the movie and the fact that some of the actors aren't exactly known for their high-quality skills. Two actors that really surprised me by how good they were here were Bill Pullman as the President and Randy Quaid as a former alien abductee who's a little off in the head. Pullman surprised me because I hadn't really seen him do a whole lot of dramatic work, which was primarily his job in this film. All I'd seen of him were comedies, one was the Mel Brooks spoof "Spaceballs" and the other was "Casper", neither really tested him as an actor though, so I was surprised with how good he was in the role. And Randy Quaid, well he's done plenty of screwball comedies as wacky characters, so I knew that he could handle that aspect easily enough, but my fear was that he would ruin the movie by taking it too far into the stupid direction. Surprisingly, Randy played things with just the right amount of crazy without going overboard, and he even handled the dramatic aspects of his character, that appear later into the movie, with an earnest sincerity that was refreshing to see. Probably the biggest surprise in the movie was Will Smith's performance, though he was but one part of an ensemble cast, whenever he was on screen he made the movie his own with relative ease. I wasn't convinced that Will could truly handle a somewhat lead actor role for a big blockbuster film, since his previous movie was the highly successful actioner "Bad Boys" with Martin Lawrence carrying half the load. But once things got going, Will proved that he definitely had what it took to solidify his place among Hollywood's A-list stars, and his continuing success within the film industry is evidence of that.<br /><br />Now on to the one thing that all reviews of science fiction movies require, the critique on the special effects work within the film. Top-notch special effects work is a key component to making any good science fiction movie, if you don't get the effects right and just wow the crowd, the audiences will turn on you in an instant. But for the folks that worked on "Independence Day" this turned out to not be a concern for them. The effects in this film were so top-of-the-line at the time the film was made, that most hold up very well to this day, a little over 10 years later. There are a couple of scenes that don't look so hot though, one would be the scene in which Vivica A. Fox's dog must jump into the hallway to avoid being burned alive, when the fire passes behind the dog it's a really obvious green-screen effect, of course there was no other way to do the scene, but I've seen better work done in plenty of other movies. Secondly, the scene where the alien attacks the doctors that are examining it within Area 51, the alien's movements look a little too hokey. Too much like stop-motion animation with all the tendrils whipping around, the movements felt choppy, kind of like when you watch some of the old Christmas TV shows that use stop-motion animation, the movements are fluid for the most part, but there's a slight choppiness that makes them feel somewhat awkward. But, other than those two times, I really can't come up with much else that hasn't held up from the special effects department, which is why this movie is still a favorite for many movie fans, and continues to hold its place as one of the best alien invasion movies ever made.<br /><br />"Independence Day" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.</p></body></html>

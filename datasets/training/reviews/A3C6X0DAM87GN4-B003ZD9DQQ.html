<meta name="summary" content="The "Downfall" Of A Nation Brings Hope For The Future"></head><body><p>"April 1945, a nation awaits its...Downfall" so goes the tagline for this movie. That should pretty much tell you all you need to know about the content of this film. Oliver Hirschbiegel's "Downfall" depicts the last 12 days before the end of WW2. The Russians are fighting their way through Berlin as the Third Reich must now face their defeat.<br /><br /> Many people have damned the movie saying the film wrongly humanizes Hitler and the Nazis. These kind of statements are misleading. Yes perhaps some are right, the movie does present Hitler as a human being, we are after all seeing the movie through his eyes. He is the star of the film but under no circumstances does the movie advocate his actions. In my opinion by presenting Hitler the way the film does it merely shows what sort of madman he was. He was a lunatic. Here was a man who failed at nearly ever endeavor he pursued. "Downfall" paints Hitler as a man filled with delusions. He insist that his army continues fighting while others around him say it is pointless. Many of his closet allies abandon him while he goes on protesting saying Germany can not make the same mistake it did during WW1 and surrender. Hitler even says he allowed the Russians to advance as far as they did. It is all a ploy. Now either Hitler was starting to lose his mind or he really did feel he could have won.<br /><br /> "Downfall" on a purely emotion level reminds me of Roman Polanski's "The Pianist" both films seem gut wrenchingly real. It should be pointed out this movie is based on two books. One of them written by Hitler's stenographer Traudl Junge entitled "Until the Final Hour" and another book entitled "Inside Hitler's Bunker" by Joachim Fest. Because of this we believe most of what we see as real. We imagine this was probably the way it really happened. And when you look at the film from that viewpoint you may find, as I did, the movie is depressing. We see people committ suicide and kill their each other, husbands, wives, even children all before they are caught. The scenes with the children broke my heart. Make no mistake about it "Downfall" is a brutally violent film that the squeamish should not see.<br /><br /> But despite the depressing tone and violence "Downfall" is a movie that needs to be seen by as many people who think they can stomach because if for any reason it will serve as a constant reminder of the horrors which were committed and how future generations must learn about the past so incidents such as these will never be repeated.<br /><br /> And what about Bruno Ganz performance? He is surely a front runner for an Oscar nomination. For people who condemn the movie for its portrayal of Hitler, you must realize the complexity of his performance. It is harder to present Hitler this way then in the fashion most wanted. For that you have to give Ganz his due credit.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: At times an all too powerful film depicting the final days of Adolf Hitler. Brutally violent and even depressing this is still a must see so it will serve as a constant reminder of what these people did.</p></body></html>

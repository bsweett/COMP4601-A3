<meta name="summary" content="A Fun Roadtrip Flick!"></head><body><p>This is a fun movie about four everyday guys, known collectively as the "Wild Hogs", who decide to add a little adventure to their lives by taking a cross-country motorcycle road trip which turns out to be a little more adventure than they had originally considered when they cross paths with the notorious Del Fuegos gang.<br /><br />The production opens nicely and moves along with a steady rhythm that kept me interested throughout the film. Humorously engaging with plenty of fun gags and cool special effects and a fun story too! A good "buddies" film to sit down to, "Wild Hogs" delivers.<br /><br />I thought the cast did an excellent job. Martin Lawrence's wife was a pleasantly surprising choice for those of you who follow the who's worked with who thing. Keep watching as the credits roll, too.<br /><br />I do highly recommend "Wild Hogs".</p></body></html>

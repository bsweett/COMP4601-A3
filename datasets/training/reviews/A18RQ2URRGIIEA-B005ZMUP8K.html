<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, but Not as Good as "POTC: The Curse of the Black Pearl""></head><body><p>Three years following the highly successful 2003 film "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl", Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly and much of its cast reprised their roles for the 2006 sequel named "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest".  Taking up where "Curse of the Black Pearl" ended, the audience learns how Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) acquired the infamous pirate ship named "The Black Pearl": he entered a blood-debt with the ghostly Davey Jones (Bill Nighy), the captain of the infamous pirate ship named "The Flying Dutchman".  Apparently, the Flying Dutchman still operated within deep ocean depths and would periodically attack other ships when Davey Jones would call upon the fearsome creature from ancient Norse mythology known as "the kraken": a giant octopus.  Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) had been told that his father drowned at sea, but that was not entirely true: his pirate father known as Bootstrap Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsg?rd) accepted becoming one of Davey Jones' ghostly crewmen rather than die.  Davey Jones and the rest of the Flying Dutchman crew had slowly transformed into creatures that were part human and part sea creature (various sea creatures).  In the meantime, Will Turner and his bride to be, Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightly), were arrested by Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) for having previously assisted Jack Sparrow escape; but grants them a reprieve if they can obtain a certain object from Jack: his special compass.  To save himself and Elizabeth, Will goes after Jack; who then abandons Will to the ghostly Davey Jones after persuading Will to try and steal a very precious key that Davey Jones always keeps on his person.  The key unlocks the contents of Davey Jones' legendary locker, whose contents will grant the owner power over Davey Jones and the kraken.<br /><br />With the usual sword fights, wonderful special effects and various twists and turns in the world of pirates, "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" is entertaining, but unlike its 2003 predecessor, the story lacked continuity and its characters were less engaging.  Some new interesting characters introduced in this film include Davey Jones, Bootstrap Bill and the voodoo-like priestess Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris).  Other returning characters included Elizabeth's father Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), the comical pirates Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) and Pintel (Lee Arenberg), and several of the crewmen from the Black Pearl.  Johnny Depp has been nominated for a Golden Globe for "Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy" for his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow.<br /><br />Overall, I rate "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" with 3.5 (rounded to 4) out of 5 stars. With the film's cliffhanger ending, we will have to wait for the next film, "Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End", which is to be released in theaters in 2007.</p></body></html>

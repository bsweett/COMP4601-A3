<meta name="summary" content="Bruce Willis in a science-fiction comedy/adventure."></head><body><p>The name "Bruce Willis" usually means it is going to be an excellent film.  This time Bruce Willis tries a CGI-effects science fiction film.  This is his 30th film.<br /><br />  In "Languages", you must press on "English 5.1" to get sound for the film.<br /><br />  You may choose "Fact Track" to receive facts about the film in English or Spanish while film is playing.  It will replace subtitles.<br /><br />  Bruce Willis plays "Korben Dallas", your typical alpha-male who wakes up with a cigarette, stereo playing and television on.  He also owns a white pussycat that keeps coming back home.<br /><br />  It's the year 2214.  Willis drives a mid-air taxi-cab (remember the Jetson's airship?) where on this day he picks up Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil [2002], Resident Evil: Apocalypse [2004]).  It guess orange hair is still in style.  She was just re-created and talks in babbling.<br /><br />  McDonald's Restaurant is still around on the 25th floor with a whole new meaning to "drive-in".<br /><br />  Disc 2 includes the "Special Features".  Too many to list, but some highlights are:<br /><br />  The Star Element: Interviews with Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich.<br /><br />  The Diva featurette includes interview with Maiwenn who played the Diva Plavalaguna.  This will also include the entire performance of Maiwenn against green screen.<br /><br />Note: Maiwenn played the Diva Plavalaguna, but was lip-syncing the opera.  It is soprano, Inva Mula's voice doing the aria.</p></body></html>

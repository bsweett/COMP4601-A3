While the overall ambiance is violent, several gruesome scenes leave little or nothing to the imagination.  Given the role of organized crime that is to be expected, though in a few scenes graphic gore was gratuitous.  In those instances the plot could have been as strong or stronger left to wilder imaginings.  From the vantage point of the Russian mob (Vory), this film presents a shadier side of London, which is very artfully done without using any of its typically associated shtick.  There is no polite reserve or refinement in the lives of these characters.  What is presented is a very bare, bleak existence that without geographical reference could easily have been a grey eastern land.  No one character stood out, thus no performance stood out.  Rather, the fluid chemistry amongst the cast created this believable world, part of it intent on resolving a mystery as furiously as the rest of it focused on hiding clues.<br /><br />The one thing that I felt this film suffered was the absence of history connecting Nikolai to the Vory.  The omission doesn't detract from the plot resolution or from Nikolai's development as a character, though a mere two lines would suffice to tie him more thoroughly into the family and generate more sympathy for his plight.  As it stood his involvement was vague and confusing, which definitely took away from the rest of the well-crafted story.  All-in-all this film carries itself well, just expect to have lingering questions in the end.</p></body></html>

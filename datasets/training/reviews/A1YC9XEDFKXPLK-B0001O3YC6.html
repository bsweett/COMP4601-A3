At least the creatures were given a &quot;weakness&quot; unlike other films where the creepy things are indestructible. Expose these puppies to sunlight and P-O-O-F !...The same thing that happens to Gremlins and vampires in the sun w/o sunblock spf 2000.<p>Vin Diesel is also another actor to watch out for as he may be the next big box office success. Right now he's a little rough around the acting edges. Yet, he's defintiely destined for greater things! As for Radha Mitchell, she portrayed her character very humanly; she proved her character was fallible and human just like the others despite her rank or authority.<p>The f/x were also reminiscent of Starship Troopers; which is a compliment and not an insult. The only annoying eye strain-excercise is the beginning of the film where the crew is new to the planet's surface;The bluish-white filter camera effect was unbearable ! <p>This is a defintie Sci-Fi must see !</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still a Night for Horror Fans to Live For."></head><body><p>While the low-budget aspects of the film make it easy to wriggle out of the implied and partially shown gruesomeness, I say stop taking the easy way out-- people. <p>Pretend you have never seen a film like this ever before.  A film that dares to show you some truly shocking scenes of gore and cannibalism.  A film which portrays a world gone mad, where the dead rise from the grave, where a women is so scared she wanders around in a state of shock and the person who helps her is a young black man.  It's the late 60's remember. <p>This film is going to go too far, it's going to show you things you have never been shown before.  It's going to keep the tension going not for just a few minutes but for much of it's running time.  Yeah, some of the acting is really over the top, but give the amateur actors their 15 minutes of fame and realize with the equivalent amount that the recent Blair Witch Project film was made for, George Romero and company made this classic-- which has inspired hundreds of horror films and nearly as many film-makers.  The 30th Anniversary edition gives you a pristine print of the film and an only at times interesting commentary track that features the co-writers and some of the cast but NOT George Romero.  The recently shot footage that is inserted into the film doesn't work. Cheap Junk to market this DVD and make money for the co-writer of the original film which is now in public domain.  However, you can and should watch the film without the newly shot footage.<p>Christopher J. Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great western movie... and Val Kilmer's best role ever"></head><body><p>1993 found a memorable cast working together to make a great film... Kirk Russell (as Wyatt Earp), Val Kilmer (as Doc Holliday), Sam Elliott (as Virgil Earp), Bill Paxton (as Morgan Earp), Powers Booth (as Curly Bill), and Michael Biehn (as Johnny Ringo). Not to mention superb supporting roles by Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Zane, Charlton Heston, Jason Priestley, and Dana Delaney. "Tombstone" takes you back to 1881 when the Earp brothers stumble into Tomstone, AZ to settle down with their spouses. It isn't long before the outlaw "Cowboys" led by Curly Bill and Johnny Ringo make trouble and the Earps decide to take action. Val Kilmer plays a witty and charasmatic Doc Holliday - the best I've ever seen - probably one of Kilmer's finest Hollywood roles. A chunky Billy Bob Thornton has a memorable role as Johnny Tyler - as Wyatt's first punk to pick on. The first half of the movie sets up the characters nicely. The second half of the movie really gets going when Wyatt Earp yells at Johnny Ringo at the train station... "You tell him I'm coming! And Hell's coming with me!" You just know that the Earp's and Doc are going to kick some major as*. The gunfights were excellent. The town with it's buildings and surroundings were believeable. Director George P. Cosmatos has not put out a finer movie to this date. This special (2002) director's cut 2-disc set gives the audience superior 5.1 dolby sound; approx 5 minutes of extra movie footage; a director's commentary; a timeline of the story, 3 different production featurette's; a corny "collectable" Tombstone map; and a game of chance (you'll play once and probably never play again). A classic western and a personal favorite (5 stars).</p></body></html>

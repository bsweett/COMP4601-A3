<meta name="summary" content="simply wonderful"></head><body><p>Saw this at a packed house on Wednsday night way before its wide release...the audience reaction showed that everyone in the theater enjoyed the film...everyone seemed to be so into it, all of us laughing together and crying together...it truly was a film where the whole audience participated in the magic...great performances all around, and beautiful scenery...this is definitely a feel good movie because I noticed that everyone was smiling afterward...a definite recommendation to all those who can appreciate a well-done and beautiful film without all the violence, sex, and gore...top notch...</p></body></html>

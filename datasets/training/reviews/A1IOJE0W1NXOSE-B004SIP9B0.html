<meta name="summary" content="Well-balanced view of a difficult time for the monarchy"></head><body><p>This movie portrays the time from the beginning of Tony Blair's era as Prime Minister through the difficult days of Princess Diana's death.  It shows the tenuous relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and the Prime Minister and traces the seeming indifference of the monarchy to the tragedy in Paris.  The Queen, Prince Philip, Charles, William, and Harry are at Balmoral Castle in Scotland when Diana is killed, and at first they do not respond to her death, calling it a "private, family matter" and assuming that the public would want them to handle it in a dignified and quiet manner.  Tony Blair (played brilliantly by Michael Sheen) has his hand on the pulse of the nation and he tries to warn the Queen that she is going against public opinion by staying silent.  Helen Mirren plays the queen with wonderful dignity and restraint and shows her to be the dutiful monarch that she is, but she also shows us flashes of the human side of her, such as when she admits to the Prime Minister that she has "never been so hated before".  It is very difficult to portray a contemporary occurrence in a movie, but the script-writer and actors get this one just right.</p></body></html>

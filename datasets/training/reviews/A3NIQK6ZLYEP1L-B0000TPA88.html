<meta name="summary" content="Wasn't that bad..."></head><body><p>Being a fan of the graphic novels I was not really eager to watch this film, scared about how badly they would wreck it.  But in the end it was a delight.  I enjoyed how they brought in each character, how they set up the plot, how they carefully set up the foundation to make it easy to move right into the action and adventure of the latter parts of the film.<br /><br />I wish they had kept some of the deleted scenes in the film, because some of them were important, linking one scene to another, but in the end the film was a good one.  The extras in the DVD, from the behind-the-scenes documentary and audio commentaries, really add to the DVD.<br /><br />Something to add to your DVD library if you are a fan of the old novels, with such super-stars like the great white hunter, Allan Quatermain, the sub captain, Captain Nemo, and that great scientist, Dr. Henry Jekyll.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this movie, remember that the graphic novels are available.  The movie is based on the first volume, but there are TWO out at the time of this review.  Great books.<br /><br />Evil thugs, explosions and lots of dark city streets that all look alike.  Have fun!</p></body></html>

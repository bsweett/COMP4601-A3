<meta name="summary" content="MAN ON FIRE--Revenge And Redemption"></head><body><p>Based on A.J. Quinnell's 1980 novel of the same name, MAN ON FIRE, despite some flaws, is one of the better ation movies of recent times, thanks to superlative performances from Denzel Washington (no surprise there) and 10 year-old Dakota Fanning.<p>In it, Washington plays a former counterinsurgency agent now down on his luck and prone to drinking Jack Daniels like they're going to reinstate Prohibition tomorrow.  But he is offered a chance from a longtime friend (Christopher Walken) to redeem himself by protecting the young daughter (Fanning) of a prominent Mexico City businessman (Marc Antony).  Although he finds both the job and Fanning onerous to be around at first, he eventually develops a bond with the young girl, whose talents involve swimming and playing the piano.  It is that bond that will drive him to get back in the killing business when he is shot twice outside the house where Fanning takes piano lessons, and the young girl is kidnapped.  Fueled by rage and disgusted at the corruption of Mexican officials who not only allowed the kidnapping to happen but even may have taken part in it, Washington works his way up the chain of command in a kidnapping gang known as "La Hermanindad" (The Brotherhood) to get Fanning back.<p>MAN ON FIRE is flawed to a certain degree by the hyperactive directing style of Tony Scott (TOP GUN; CRIMSON TIDE), which involves herky-jerky camera work, different film stocks, and mind-warping editing, techniques that are not really new to him (and which had been perfected by Oliver Stone in JFK and NATURAL BORN KILLERS).  Also, the stereotyping of Mexicans here as evil and vicious killers and/or kidnappers is a bit much.  And yet, what makes MAN ON FIRE work as well as it does is that bond that develops between Washington and Fanning early on.  It gives Washington's subsequent killing spree a greater meaning than just another 21st century DEATH WISH bloodbath.  Veteran actress Rachel Ticotin gives a good supporting performance as a Mexican newspaper reporter who assists Washington in finding the members of La Hermanidad, which she has been trying to expose for years.  In between the original Mexican guitar score by Harry Gregson-Williams are splotches of Debussy ("Clair De Lune"), Puccini ("Nessun Dorma"), and, more prominently, Linda Ronstadt's Mexican-tinged 1977 country-rock version of "Blue Bayou", which gives Washington's character a humanizing quality and makes him more than just a remorseless killer.  Walken also gives a good turn as his former partner who tells Mexican officials why he is relentless in going after Fanning's kidnappers--"She taught him what it was like to live again."<p>Definitely not for everyone (it is a rather violent film, and the editing and camera work could give people headaches), MAN ON FIRE is nevertheless a very worthy film, better than most revenge and kidnapping films of the last several years.</p></body></html>

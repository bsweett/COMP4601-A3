<meta name="summary" content="Washington is awesome!"></head><body><p>Denzel Washington plays a man with a scarred past and a drinking problem. His life changes for the better when he becomes the bodyguard of a little girl (Dakota Fanning) who shows him that it's ok to live again. She is kidnapped and he of course goes nuts and tracks down everyone who was involved. He brutally kills them when he finds them.<br /><br />  The first hour is about Washington and Dakota's friendship and their scenes together are touching. Then once she's kidnapped it quicky becomes a violent revenge movie. However I forgave it for that quick change because it's a very cool revenge movie and Washington does some of his best work. The supporting cast is reall good too.  Christopher Walken is real good as Washington's good friend. Of course gets to deliver another great speeche as he explains that it was a big mistake to kidnap Dekota. After that speech unfortunetly he disapears from the film though.<br /><br />  Plus Dekota Flanning  has really good scenes with Washington. Marc Anthony (The Substitute)) and Radha Mitchell (Pitch Black, Phone Booth) are also good as Dekota's parents, especially Mitchell though. Giancarlo Giannini (Hannibal, Mimic) also does some good work as a cop who wants to help out Washington. You also have Rachel Ticotin (Total Recall) as a reporter who gives Washington leads and Mickey Rourke (Angel Heart) as a lawyer. So yes it's really great cast but still even if Washington didn't have great back up he could've still heald it on his own. He's just so good in this and yes I agree with Richard Roeper, maybe he even is better here than he was in Training Day.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The movie that popularised a million clich&eacute;s"></head><body><p>Widely renowned as being, along with John Carpenter's Halloween, the movie that spawned not only a seemingly endless franchise (check out the recent Jason X) but also popularised the horror movie during the 80's.  Of course, it's a near splatter-fest which manages to incorporate just about every clich&eacute; that the horror genre has become famous for.  Based around Camp Crystal after it's re-opened after a couple of gruesome murders a few years ago, it's not long before young attractive counsellors are being punished for having sex or going outside to 'investigate'.  Right up to the virginal survivor this is horror clich&eacute; at its peak, but admitedly enjoyable for the obvious fun the director has with it all.<p>It's perhaps strange that this of all horror movies of the 80's is still regarded as a classic piece, because there's absolutely nothing here that's new.  Even the death scenes leave a lot to the imagination rather than showing all-out gore.  Certainly it's nothing special amid the other films that are exactly like it, although the mythos built around it all will definitely keep you entertained.  The best scenes are probably towards the end when Mrs Vorhees is revealed as the real killer, whispering 'Kill her.  Kill her Mommy!' before running off after the girl who runs into the wood rather than to the nearest vehicle.  The end of Mrs Vorhees may induce laughs rather than scares (watch out for her hands still clasping and unclasping after she's been decapitated in slow-motion).  Even so, the conclusion is genuinely shocking, and there's plenty of fun to be had in this kind of film, if not only to pick out how many clich&eacute;s of the genre you can see.  Also there's a young Kevin Bacon cast as the camp's local hunk, who also is on the receiving end of the movie's most imaginative death.  There's also one particularly annoying perky girl who, once she's hitched a ride with the serial killer, will have you cheering that her end is near.</p></body></html>

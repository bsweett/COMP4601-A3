<meta name="summary" content="The Sweet End Of The Lollipop..."></head><body><p>Like Marilyn herself, this film is irresistably charming. The immortal lines, the fabulous cast and the wonderful direction by Billy Wilder makes for non-stop fun. It's a film that will be enjoyed then, now and forever by the entire family.<br /><br />The time is 1929. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are struggling musicians who happen to witness a murder, in a garage, on St Valentines day. The mob lead by "Spats"(George Raft) is after them. Their only hope is to hide out with a traveling band. The band happens to be an all girls band. The guys, don women's clothing(and look scrumptious) and bunk in with the gals,including the very sweet and sexy "Sugar"(Monroe) and the fun begins. From the moment they spy Sugar ("When she moves, it's like Jell-o on springs")they loose their hearts and so do we.<br /><br />Tony falls for Marilyn("I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop"), Joe E. Brown("Zoweee!") falls for Jack, and the thugs are hot on their trail. You just won't want it to end, and even when it does you'll find yourself smiling just thinking of it.For sure it is the "sweet end of the lollipop".<br /><br />For those looking for the DVD -  MGM has put together one terrific package. See my DVD review for details of transfer and feautres here:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXCR">Some Like It Hot</a>.<br /><br />A wonderful addition to any VHS or DVD library. This is THE definitive "screwball comedy". Well worth having. And I leave you with Joe E. Brown's immortal line....."Nobody's Perfect!"...enjoy...Laurie</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Coraline"></head><body><p>If any proof were needed that 3-D movies have entered a bold new era, Coraline is it; this stylistically bold, emotionally resonant stop-motion flick is a twisted marvel. Directed by Henry Selick and based upon the best seller by Neil Gaiman, Coraline follows the phantasmagoric exploits of the title character, a bored 11-year-old who discovers a door in her house that leads to a parallel version of her life -- one that at first is enchanting, but soon threatens to entrap our hero. Coraline is one of the most visually dazzling pictures to come along in many a moon, and it's anchored by a delightfully twisted storyline.</p></body></html>

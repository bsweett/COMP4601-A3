<meta name="summary" content=""Waltzing With Bears""></head><body><p>If I ever had any illusions about the inner nature of grizzly bears, Gary Larson's FAR SIDE cartoons ("Look! Sandwiches" on seeing men in sleeping bags) would have longsince disabused me of them.  But I don't think I ever really had any.  I mean, I sort of liked Smokey and Yogi as a kid.  And like young Timmy Dexter (aka Timothy Treadwell) I had a slew of teddy bears as a kid whom I lovee, well, ferociously.  But I still know in my heart of hearts that had I ever stumbled across a real bear in the woods in back of my house (which seemed like a possibility at the time) I would scarcely have known whether to s--t or go blind.<br /><br />Still the myth of the benign bear is a strong one in our culture.  Impressive as they are in terms of size and strength, however, their bulk and their lumbering gait suggest something half-comic, half-terrifying.  Good to focus on the later.  As this movie notes, the "native peoples" of Alaska have always respected the bear--and kept their distance.  Child man Timothy Treadwell, an interloper in them parts, has not learned that lesson.<br /><br />It is easy to see how Werner Herzog, a filmmaker already obsessed with obsessive madness, would be drawn to Treadwell as a subject.  Herzog never met Treadwell of course, and he only came to know the latter through the video footage the mad conservationist left behind.  And it is fascinating stuff.  Treadwell proves to be everything people said he was:  devoted, a little crazy, passionate, quite crazy really, child like, foulmouthed, naive and calculating--and a real loon when you get down to it.<br /><br />It's easy to see why Treadwell was such a hit at the schools he offered to speak in for free.  (But really, what were those school administrators thinking???) His childlike manner, his sense of wonder and downright zaniness might have made him the ideal kiddie show host in an era when there were actually kiddie shows.  There's something kind of Pee-wee-esque about Treadwell.  If he weren't chasing after bears every year for 13 years, you might expect to find him on a quest for his bicycle.<br /><br />But we all know that kiddie show hosts have a dark side.  And even though no one ever caught Treadwell relieving his tensions in an adult theater, his occasional sexually themed commentary shows him to be a tad on the puerile side.  At one point, he starts rambling on about how he wishes he were gay sometimes because they have it so easy (???).  Just head out to a park or beach or rest room.  A cinch.  And no pretense.  Right!  His is a remarkably adolescent view of homosexuality...and of sexuality in general, it seems.<br /><br />And like many an adolescent, Treadwell was subject to self-mythologizing.  Herzog shows how his supposedly spontaneous commentary was actually the result of several takes, 'til he got the angle and the lighting and the text just right.  Well, if you're going to be a spokeman for conservation, do it right, right?  Or at least, do it big.<br /><br />Does he really befriend these bears or is it all show.  Well, the critters he really seems to establish a rapport with are a mother fox and her offspring.  The human/canine bond is an ancient one, of course, and in the context of the film, it makes sense--even with red foxes instead of hounds.  But although Treadwell is able to approach bears astonishingly closely, they seem more bemused than intrigued by him.<br /><br />Still they put up with him--for 13 years.  And there seems to be some speculation that the bear that killed him in the early fall of 2002 was an outsider bear, his regulars having already headed off for their hibernation ritual.  If so, that would go some distance to prove that the bears he came to know did not turn on him.  At the very least, you have to admit that he pulled something off for 13 straight years.  What that says about the nature of man or beast is not clear.  But you cannot begrudge him at least some respect for going where no (sane) man has ever gone before.<br /><br />Herzog did a remarkable job, paring down the extensive home footage to make a sharp, succinct--an ultimately touching-- documentary on the life of this poor lost soul.  It's quite an achievement.  Perhaps it works because Treadwell comes across as a younger, sweeter natured Klaus Kinski in many ways.  But just as delusional and, yes, as obsessed as any played by Kinski in his Herzog films.<br /><br />Exactly a week after seeing this film, I went to a local folk concert featuring nationally known, but regionally based singer Priscilla Herdman.  At the end of the first set, she trotted out that old chestnut "Waltzing With Bears" to great effect.  Could it be that a Timothy Treadwell seriously bought into that kind of notion, so prevalent in our fairy stores and in Disney films.  I guess you do have to wonder about anyone who gives multi-ton grizzlies  monikers like "Rowdy" and "Mr. Chocolate."<br /><br />Still I was surprised to hear some audience members agree with the Alaskan local who awkwardly (more than maliciosly, really) asserts that "Timothy got what he deserved."  Yes, and smokers "deserve" lung cancer, right?  And speeders "deserve" to die in a car crash.  That scarcely seems to be the message that Herzog is putting forward here.  Nature is cruel, yes.  And the universe, indifferent.  But there is a beauty in nature that most of us only pay lip service to--or watch on PBS.  Treadwell knew that beauty better than most of us ever will.<br /><br />And no one "deserves" to die like that.</p></body></html>

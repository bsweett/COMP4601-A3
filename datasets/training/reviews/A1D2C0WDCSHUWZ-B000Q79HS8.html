<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Bourne&quot; again"></head><body><p>The Bourne is back, as played by Matt Damon, in &quot;The Bourne Supremacy.&quot; While the story-line and characterization improve from the mediocre first movie of this proposed trilogy, Paul Greengrass's shakycam direction and Julia Stiles's tepid acting bog it back down.<br /><br /> Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is in hiding with his leftover girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) in India, and he has the weirdest feeling that someone is after him. It turns out that he isn't just being paranoid -- a CIA agent turns up, and Jason and Marie try to escape. After losing Marie, Jason sets out in his former life as an assassin.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, Bourne has somehow been framed for an assassination that, needless to say, he didn't carry out. Now he's a hunted man again, and he has to somehow clear his name and try to live in peace again. But with a ruthless agent on his tail (Karl Urban), his chances seem to be getting a lot slimmer.<br /><br /> It takes awhile to figure out exactly what went on in this movie -- it's all quite confusing and needlessly enigmatic. But the core of the movie is Bourne kicking butt, and they manage to pull that off pretty well -- Damon isn't a steroid hulk, and the action scenes seem to be tailored to fit around him.<br /><br /> Director Paul Greengrass seems to be under the impression that an MTV-style shakycam will give the film realism. Nope, just motion sickness. The constant jerking and wobbling are enough to make you dizzy. What's more, with the through-Bourne's-eyes method, we don't get to see half of what happens around him. Without the shakycam the film would have been far more enjoyable than it ended up being -- as it is, it just feels chaotic.<br /><br /> Damon isn't a great actor, but he's obviously giving this role his best efforts, and he gives off a kind of cold, grim intensity that's well suited to the role. Franka Potente's limp, annoying presence drops out quickly, to be replaced by the tepid but passable presence of Julia Stiles. The stars here are Joan Allen, as a tightly wound CIA official, and the coldly menacing Karl Urban as Bourne's Russian counterpart.<br /><br /> What would have been a moderately fun action flick is wrecked by the shakycam shooting style. &quot;Bourne Supremacy&quot; had promise, but on the silver screen it's suited best to people who don't get motion sick.</p></body></html>

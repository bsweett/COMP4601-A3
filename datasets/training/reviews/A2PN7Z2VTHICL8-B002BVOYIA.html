<meta name="summary" content="Incredibly moving true tale of one of life's real heroes"></head><body><p>In 1994 one of the most brutal acts of civil war occurred in Rwanda, Africa.  It was genocide on the most horrific scale of our lifetimes, rivaled only by Hitler's regime in the 1930's.  Hotel Rwanda is the true story of one man, hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina, who managed to harbor 1,268 refugees inside the upscale hotel he managed until he could find a way to bring them all to safety behind the Tutsi rebel lines.<br /><br />Though a peace treaty between the Hutu's and the Tutsi's was signed by the Rwandan President, only hours later the president was assassinated and the militia were given the signal to begin killing the "Tutsi cockroaches" that had once enslaved the Hutu's.<br /><br />Hotel Rwanda is a 10 star movie, it left me breathless with its beautiful portrayal of bravery and courage, and crying from the brutality of a genocidal regime.  Not since Shindler's List have I seen a movie with this much power and courage, enough to make even this cold-hearted reviewer break down and cry like a baby.  When one single, everyday person shows this much valor and heroism in the face of utter hopelessness, it makes me believe in the human race again.<br /><br />Although there is not much overt blood in this movie, there are scenes of violence so horrific that you will cringe in your chair and set aside your cup of hot chocolate.  Hotel Rwanda is a tale of faith, hope, love, bravery, courage, violence, callousness, atrocities, and the shame of humanity.  Only UN General Romeo Dallaire (renamed Coronal Oliver for the movie, and expertly played by Nick Nolte) stayed behind when all other industrialized nations fled the country and left over one million people to be butchered in the genocide.<br /><br />The cast in Hotel Rwanda was incredible, with stellar performances by Don Cheadle playing Paul Rusesabagina, Sophie Okonedo playing Tatiana Rusesabagina, Desmond Dube playing Dube, Fana Mokoena playing General Bizimungu, and Joaquin Phoenix playing reporter Jack Daglish.<br /><br />If there is one movie that everyone should see, it is this one.  There are simply not enough good things to say about this movie and how incredibly moving it is, you will just have to sit down and watch it for yourself.  I wound out buying it the same day I rented it, and have watched it over and over, my mouth still dropping open in amazement at how people can be both cruel and kind.  Buy this one.<br /><br />Also, I strongly recommend picking up a copy of 'Shake Hands With The Devil', the real account of Rwanda written by Romeo Dallaire, the UN General that stayed behind during the war.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The best thing about this film: the ending credits"></head><body><p>At the risk of appearing a smart alec, the thing that most caught my attention about this movie was the credits at the end.  Rather than the overused black screen with scrolling names in white, the credits run as Michael Clayton is whisked away through the city after taking down the bad guys.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is mediocre.  The same basic story has been told time and time again, with only the faces of the heroes and villains changing.  Dying to see a movie about the lid being blown off corporate greed and corruption?  Check out The Insider.<br /><br />Clooney's acting is quite good, as usual.  Tilda Swinton performed adequately as a villainess, but the screenwriter did her no favors.<br /><br />How this movie got so much Oscar talk, I haven't a clue. It's OK, but nothing more.</p></body></html>

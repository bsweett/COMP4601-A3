<meta name="summary" content="Very good B horror flick"></head><body><p>I liked this movie, but I am one that loves B horror flicks. I read in an earlier post that this movie is just like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I don't agree with that at all. This movie is way better than the TCM by far. It was based on a true story in Australia about some some "hikers" getting trapped at a hiking trail and someone comes along to "save" them. Yes, it seems like the story has been told before. If you bear in mind, history does repeat itself and so do crimes even in different countries. I thought that the acting was very good and the story does hold it's ground. Yes, there were holes in the story with the "victims", but this is a B horror flick and it doesn't have a very high budget. See this movie and maybe it will be just as enjoyable for you as it was for me. I recommend this one!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Film For Classical Music Lovers!  Too Bad About the DVD!"></head><body><p>This is not the Director's Cut version and hence clocks in at "only" 160 minutes but I found myself enjoying the film so much that I didn't really feel the time.  I'm a big fan of all kinds of music and Classical music is among my favourite genres and although Handel, Bach, Vivaldi and Beethoven hold greater esteem for me than does Mozart, I'm still able to appreciate his genius and so a film like this is a real treat.  Irrespective of whether or not Salieri really was behind Mozart's death in real life as it is depicted here in reel life you have to admit that this is a very good film that shows how much hypocrisy and envy can conspire to destroy the truly beautiful in life.<br /><br />The problem with this one-disc dvd version though is the picture quality which hasn't been restored and so you get imperfections such as black and white spots on many frames and the resolution isn't as sharp as I would like it to be.  The sound quality, however, is very good having been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and is the aspect of this dvd that I enjoyed the most.  There are no Special Features here worth mentioning such as interviews with cast and crew or making-of documentaries either.<br /><br />If you are not too fussed about picture quality and/or special features though, this one-disc dvd version is a bare bones non-Director's version of a very good film for classical music lovers.  Believe me when it comes to this genre, very few performers can top Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields and you get them here on Dolby Digital Surround sound too!<br /><br />As for me, I'll "upgrade" to the Blu-ray version of this film as soon as I come around to getting a Blu-ray player.  Hopefully, the picture quality has been restored well in that version.<br /><br />Updated 17 July 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not let me review this separately, I'll have to do this here: the digibook director's cut blu-ray of this film is now the definitely version.  This together with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001992NW4">The Exorcist (Extended Director's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] are now the best blu-ray releases that I've seen and I wish all blu-ray re-releases are made this way.  Firstly, most of us already have vhs or dvd versions of our favourite films and so what should the studios do the entice us to double-dip?  Putting the film on blu-ray and in a digibook format certainly helps and here we also get not only the best version of the film on one disc plus improved special features but also a very nice cd of a selection of Mozart's best works as well.  Both the picture and sound qualities have been vastly improved over the standard dvd version that I reviewed above as well.  Although a digital copy is included I have no views on that as I don't have any use for a digital copy really.<br /><br />This is a very fine blu-ray release and is among the best that I've seen so far.  Great content, great picture and sound quality and improved special features makes this an easy review:  Very highly recommended!</p></body></html>

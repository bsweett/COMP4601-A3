<meta name="summary" content="Father and Son"></head><body><p>If you are a parent, especially if you have at least one son, this movie will really hit home. It's brutal; it's emotional; it's violent; and it's heart warming.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is as always in superior form. He plays Michael Sullivan, a 1931 gangster for hire loyal to the Irish mob. But the Irish mob is not loyal to Mike. So Mike needs to go on the run with one of his sons, and ultimately strike back at his antagonists with his son in tow.<br /><br />The father/son bonding and the family losses that Mike suffers are deeply felt. The story is well told, suspenseful and well acted by all.<br /><br />This could have easily been cut down to a PG-13 film. But kudos to the director and producers for an extremely realistic portrayal of a family man involved in the mob circa 1931.<br /><br />Add this to your collection of classics.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful camera work"></head><body><p>As I have just watched and reviewed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB563E">The Road [Blu-ray</a>] and I actually watched this movie first, I felt it only fair that I should review it as well, as they both deal with a similar plotline, but are starkly different movies.<br />The synopsis is covered in great detail above (and in other reviews) so I won't spend too long on that, or put in any spoilers, but this story is so much more than was quite unfairly described by one professional critic as "The Road Warrior (Mad Max) without cars!"<br />Denzel Washington plays a nomadic man on a mission, wandering for some 30 years through a post apocalyptic landscape carrying the last known copy of the King James Bible, answering a calling, and quest to deliver it somewhere important, knowing only that he must go west.<br />Like the aforementioned "Road" he is waylaid by marauding gangs, cannibalism, and a general dystopian population left either blind or maimed by whatever catastrophe occurred. Enter Gary Oldman as a intelligent but malevolent self proclaimed leader of a small town, surviving in the dust and misery, hell bent on getting his hand on the book, and hoping to rekindle the power of faith in people for his own ends.<br />That's about it in a nutshell really, there are some other characters of course, and little subplots, and for those familiar with the Book of Eli in the Bible itself, there are some obvious connotations added, but these are never overplayed.<br />I want to talk about the film itself for a second and the camera work and CGI, the Blu-Ray transfer is as crisp as I have seen, and they have made this World so believable and real on screen, you can almost taste the dust. The heavily tinted camera work adds depth, and a grey despair to the whole movie, which arguably would have much flatter without it. The story itself is clever, if a little unbelievable at times, and is much more stylized than other movies of the genre, but it feels right for this movie. The acting is great from everyone, even another little cameo for Tom Waits (always a joy to watch) is great.<br />Not a movie for repeat viewing I fancy, once you know the end, have lived the "journey" and got to the twist in the tale, but nonetheless a very good movie.<br />Plenty of action pads out the more thoughtful aspects of the film, as Denzel is a sort of machete wielding one man army, as if possessed by a higher power (again the nod to religion) in his single minded of purpose, and unyielding journey.<br />I knocked off half a star (maybe unfairly) for the frequent, "is he or isn't he?", "how did he do that", "how come they......" aspects of the movie, but I guess some poetic license by the Director is not all bad.<br />Very impressive, visually stunning movie. 4.5 stars</p></body></html>

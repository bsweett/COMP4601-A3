<meta name="summary" content="Slightly worse than the first"></head><body><p>As I said in my review of the first movie, the people trashing the first two Spider-Man movies must not have really read the comics. Tobey Maguire returns as Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane, James Franco as Harry Osbourne. This movie feature Doctor Octavious, now the weak point of this movie is the motivation for Doc Oc being Doc Oc. My other problem is that magically peter doesn't want to be Spider-Man, because he keeps missing out on dates with Mary Jane. And because of that, he starts to lose his powers if you will. Until the end, when Mary Jane gets kidnapped by Doc Oc. And Spider-Man comes roaring back, with a fight on the subway with Doc Oc. Who is really working for Harry, who has gone crazy. Blaming Spider-Man for the death of his father, which Harry in the comics actually did blame Peter. And lead to Harry being the Hobgoblin, of course that doesn't happen in this movie. Although Harry does find out that Peter is Spider-Man, In the end Peter rescues Mary Jane, without his mask on. And he convinces Doc Oc, to destroy the machine he was trying to build. Killing himself in the process, All in all. I would say the first two Spider-Man movies are excellent, it's the third one that ruined the series.</p></body></html>

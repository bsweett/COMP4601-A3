Jameson, taken from the product review<br /><br />If you are Clint Eastwood, you can make a movie how it should be made. As grand, iconoclastic Dirty Harry, Eastwood stood up for those who would make America better and stronger. As Walt Kowalski, he fiercely faces down a neighborhood gang and rescues young Thao, brother of Sue, his sassy new Hmong friend and neighbor.<br /><br />This is the point where Eastwood becomes Walt--racist, mouth filled with racial epithets spilled forthrightly on the objects of his racism. But it is not a purposeful racism, just one of habit and habitat. As with any meaningful exchange with those different from us, he begins to see that the Hmongs are people--and Americans, as he is, but in a different cultural context. It is actually liberating for Walt to make this connection (he doesn't have one with his sons and their families).<br /><br />My first thought after seeing this movie was disappointment mixed with respect. "Gran Torino" did not produce the thrill I expected, but instead delivers compassion and redemption and sacrifice, inestimable values in the big picture of Life. Ol' Walt had more in common with the priest's boss than first meets the eye.<br /><br />I wondered why Eastwood specifically chose Hmongs to be his neighbors (were they initially scripted in?). Developing genuine concern, compassion, and finally affection for his neighbors, Walt shows how Archie Bunker could have been 20 years down the road of American cultural dynamics.<br /><br />This, I thought, was Eastwood's purpose. America is changing; let's acknowledge it, accept it, and embrace this change. How my heart swelled with respect and fondness for this new icon--a Walt embracing his own mortality by acceptance and finally redemption.<br /><br />This is a remarkable movie--<br />Judy Polhemus.</p></body></html>

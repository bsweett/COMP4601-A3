The story was contrived and dull, it seemed like they just wanted to make a "Ring"-type movie, hoping they could bank off it.  The special effects were totally subpar and this film was NOT scary!!!!!!!!  It was actually funny.  I burst out laughing when the creepy crawly ghost thingies made "scary" noises. I can picture the filmakers getting all excited and caught up "Yeah! this will get 'em, that's sure to freak 'em out!"  NOT. Instead of being disturbing, the frog like groans reminded me of a 10 year old trying to annoy his parents.  Totally lame!  Nothing could save this movie.</p></body></html>

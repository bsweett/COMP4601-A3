<meta name="summary" content="Eyes wide open"></head><body><p>Last weekend the wife and I watched Stanley Kubrick's last film, Eyes Wide Shut. For her, it was her first time. For me, it was the first time since it had originally come out, back in 1999.<br /><br />When it came out, it left many people a little disappointed. Kubrick was a film-making master, and his last film seemed stilted, wooden, and mystifying.<br /><br />While I understand the comments of those days, I have concluded that people who thought in this fashion, well, missed the point. The film is a study in a particular aspect of human behavior: sexuality and sexual behavior within the confines of a marriage.<br /><br />Let's review. One night, following a party the night before where both parties in a married relationship engaged in some flirtatious behavior, the wife admits to having adulterous thoughts one day in the past. This severely unnerves the husband, a doctor, who then is called away due to the death of a patient. What follows is a series of near encounters with morally questionable sexual situations:<br /><br />  1. the dead man's daughter confesses her love for the doctor...she herself is engaged to another man<br />  2. the doctor meets a prostitute, and goes to her home, and is interrupted before things go too far by a call from his wife<br />  3. the doctor needs a costume to go to a party, and encounters what appears to be under-age sex between the costumer's daughter and some businessmen<br />  4. the doctor gets caught by the powers-that-be at an orgy for the highest class of society<br /><br />In all of these situations, the next day brings home all of the associated dangers with these encounters:<br /><br />  1. The fiance answers the phone when the doctor calls, bringing the doctor into conflict with another man<br />  2. The prostitute isn't home when the doctor returns...she has AIDS<br />  3. The young girl is offered to the doctor by her father...can you imagine the dangers in that?<br />  4. The power-that-be hustle one of the doctor's friends out of town by force, have the doctor visibly followed, and appear to have one of the orgies other attendees killed.<br /><br />The affect that this has on the doctor feels palpable and real...you can see it in the way that he looks at his family one evening, thinking that has whole family life is crumbling away, under siege from both his wife's tale, and from the consequences of his own actions and near-infidelity.<br /><br />What comes across as stilted is deliberately so...Kubrick wants folks to understand that certain things are staged, but the consequences of those things can be real. Compare and contrast Thomas Gibson's acting in his encounter with Tom Cruise (and vice-versa), and Cruise's own acting both when he hear's his wife's tale for the first time, and as he becomes more and more terrified of the consequences of his own actions. Kubrick is drawing attention to consequences.<br /><br />This is a set piece, like Lost in Translation, and a well-thought-out one at that. Kubrick's films were never simple ones, even going back to Spartacus. So, those who dismissed Eyes Wide Shut, I suggest you think twice. And for myself, it's time to resume the Kubrick film festival that got interrupted so long ago.</p></body></html>

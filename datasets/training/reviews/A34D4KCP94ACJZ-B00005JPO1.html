<meta name="summary" content="The Thrill of Discovery is Gone"></head><body><p>Indiana Jones is back and those who love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXC5">the original films</a>, especially <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>, will be placed under the spell of nostalgic bliss until you realize the following:  That Harrison Ford is just a cranky old man punching-in for one last paycheck; John Hurt is Raspberry Award destined every single time without proper directorial guidance; Ray Winstone's character was seemingly forced into the screenplay, no one cares who he is or why he is there; the hype about how Shia LaBeouf is entirely undeserving of any and all kinds of hype is spot on; George Lucas is fat-headed and out of touch with what made the original films great, and really, after Jar-Jar how are we surprised?; and Karen Allen smiles in every scene as if she can't believe for one second that she is in a  $185 million dollar movie, and neither could I.  I will say in all fairness that Cate Blanchett is as professional as to be expected.  There are scenes in this film that capture the excitement and unlikely humorous action of the original three, but where <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">Temple of Doom</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">Last Crusade</a> at times teetered on pushing the degree to which I will suspend disbelief in exchange for a laugh, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls doesn't assume I want to believe any of its shenanigans.  I don't want to be critical of the fundamental science fiction/historical fiction story, because it could've worked in the right hands and with actors and filmmakers who knew the magic they had with the original films.  Surprise! They're cashing in this time around kids, so don't be fooled.<br /><br />Harrison Ford has bits of that same presence but his effort is clearly lacking.  He plays Dr. Jones as if he just doesn't seem impressed with discovering these artifacts anymore.  His performances in the earlier films expressed that of a passionate archeologist, someone who cares tremendously about the artifact he must recover and preserve.  He wanted to stop the Nazis from getting the Ark of the Covenant or the Holy Grail because they were arrogant enough to think they were actually worthy of such power.  They were plunderers. There was a lesson in there and even though it was just an action film, the message was a little more than just "Nazis, I hate these guys".  None of that exists here in the fourth installment.  The passion behind discovering history's most provoking questions seems to have been lost and that is after all why Indy would do absolutely anything, including jump from a horse into a moving jeep with eight armed men, to recover an item and ensure that it is kept from those who would abuse its power.  Besides, Han Solo and Indy are two great heroes but with all due respect, in interviews Harrison Ford gives me the creeps.  He has that creepy earring and that subtle and cold arrogance.  I hate criticizing celebrities but he just doesn't come off as a likeable guy and there are times during this film that he isn't really acting at all, so it is kind of relevant to mention.<br /><br />I want to explain what completely ruined this film for me.  I was actually prepared to give this three or four stars and a slight recommendation until the film started to climax and the unbelievable happened.  Even among scenes of CGI dancing, landing on rocks as if they were pillows, cheesy and rushed written dialogue etc., I could not believe it when one character was knocked from a cavalry of moving vehicles in the jungle and into some vines above.  Somehow this character miraculously obtained the ability to telepathically communicate to the monkeys in the same way that Aquaman communicates with fish, and so they followed as he made his through the jungle via vine-swinging like Tarzan.  Perhaps this was because the scorpion that bit him earlier was radioactive?  It is the kind of scene the skews everything for me.  I began to realize I was watching a bad movie and I grew quite sad.<br /><br />I would listen to anyone who says that Raiders of the Lost Ark is the greatest adventure film ever made, so my realization halfway through Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls was profoundly disheartening.  I loved these movies but as with any sequel, there are too many powers banking on the idea that the success of the original can be equaled.  Unfortunately for us, $311 million dollars later and they are still right.</p></body></html>

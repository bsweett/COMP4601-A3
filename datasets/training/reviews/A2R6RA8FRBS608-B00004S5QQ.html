<meta name="summary" content="a great film with so much memorable dialog"></head><body><p>Casablanca is one of the most essential films you should watch and own in your DVD collection. Casablanca has action, romance, intrigue and much, much more. It's also a story about people suffering in the most desperate of times during World War II when The Nazis were occupying many countries and even had a presence in North Africa where this film takes place. The cinematography and the choreography are excellent. In addition, the acting is superlative and the plot moves along at a very good pace.<br /><br />When the action starts, we see the French Moroccan town of Casablanca where refugees from Nazi Europe come in the hopes of getting a high priced, black market exit visa to Lisbon--and from there, America. An expatriate named Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns a nightclub in Casablanca where they serve up the drinks and the local Vichy government official Captain Renault (Claude Rains) turns a blind eye to the illegal gambling there--just so long as Rick lets him win at roulette! At the same time we also learn that two German couriers have been killed--and the two exit visas they had have been stolen by an unknown thief. The Nazis are fast on the hunt for this man, whom they believe to be a big resistance fighter named Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Laszlo has been a tough enemy of the Nazis; he even escaped from a concentration camp!<br /><br />One night Victor and his wife Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) enter Rick's caf&eacute; hoping to buy those two precious exit visas from a character simply named Ugarte (Peter Lorre). Ugarte gets into a fight with some Nazis and he is killed--but not before he slips the exit visas to Rick for some "temporary safekeeping." Eventually the Nazi Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) confronts Victor and his wife Ilsa in his office with Captain Renault; but Strasser will only let them out of Casablanca if Victor rats on other leaders of the resistance movement.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a whole other story is percolating--and this aspect of the story gets pretty hot, too. It seems that just before the German occupation of France, Rick and Victor's wife Ilsa had a brief love affair. At the time, Ilsa thought that Victor was dead and so she didn't think she was cheating on him. However, Rick gets a huge shock. Just when Rick and his sidekick Sam the piano player (Dooley Wilson) are about to leave Paris for safer ground along with Ilsa, Sam hands Rick a note from Ilsa telling him they can never see each other again and she doesn't even say why. But now that Rick sees Ilsa is married to Victor, Rick finally knows why Ilsa dumped him. But wow, he is upset and angry anyway! He still loves Ilsa; and she loves both him and Victor in her heart of hearts.<br /><br />Although it may seem that I've already written too much, I already left out some juicy details to the plot to keep you interested up to this point. And, of course, this is all very heavy stuff--how will it all turn out? Will Victor be trapped by Major Strasser and the other Nazis and be unable to leave Casablanca? Will Ilsa leave Victor for Rick now that she knows she still loves Rick? What ever does happen to those exit visas that Ugarte gave to Rick--does Rick hold onto them or will he sell them to the highest bidder and get out of Casablanca himself? Watch and find out!<br /><br />The single DVD version of this movie doesn't have too many extras; but you will get a half-hour documentary entitled "You Must Remember This" which is both hosted and narrated by Lauren Bacall. We do get outtakes but they are included in this documentary.  In addition, I believe that if you buy the two DVD edition of this film, you get a much longer (almost 90 minute) documentary about Humphrey Bogart's career also hosted by Lauren Bacall. The two DVD edition has commentaries by Roger Ebert and Rudy Behlmer.<br /><br />Casablanca is a "must-have" movie with outstanding attention to detail; the story is practically guaranteed to have quite an effect on you. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who enjoy classic movies will cherish this as well.</p></body></html>

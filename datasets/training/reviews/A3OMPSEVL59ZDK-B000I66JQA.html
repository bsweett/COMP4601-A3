<meta name="summary" content="I must defend this film."></head><body><p>This film is the first film in a long time where I actualy agree with the film that may or may not bring home the big Best Pic award at the Oscars. Normally that prize is given to the film that's the most showy and obvious. This film had the power to do something very few films can do today and that is, give the audiece some more credit and give them some more to think about afterwards. Everyone is wondering WHY they were so sad. In the great tradition of Mr. David Lynch I believe that we don't always need to be spoon fed the answers. Haven't you ever been sad and could not for the life of you figure out why? The human person is far more complex then to just sum things up in a neat package. It's far too easy to dimiss this film as a "chick-flick" and just say that women are too dramatic. Women are complex and beautiful creatures. They are far more keen to their emotions then men are, and that is what the film is about. I thought this was a striking film and simply one of the best of the year. But to me it does stand out just a little bit more because it had a wonderful conclusion and I couldn't stop talking about it afterwards.<p>And about the whole repressed Lesbian thing. That is far too easy an answer. The only Lesbian in the movie was Meryl Streep, Virginia Wolf and Julianne Moore did it out of a repressed longing just to be free to do whatever they wanted. It was a sign of inner rebellion. To dumb the film down into "a movie about three depressed lesbians" is an insult to the film and the three great actresses who brought it to life. Each performance was just an eye opening experience, and the cross over from past to present was very reminiscent of another great film of 2002, Adaptation. <p>In a time where movies are far too straight forward and peddle the audience with easy answers it's nice to see that film's still leave themselves open to interpretation. Lives are not so neat and easy to explain. When you can answer all the questions that come up in your life abouts sadness and joy then come back to this film and ridicule it, but if you cannot I suggest you watch it again and admire it for what it doesn't answer. <p>To the many women who live long hard hours.</p></body></html>

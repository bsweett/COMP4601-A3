The appearance does give it the same movie quality "bound in human flesh" look, and the feeling of it is, well, interesting. Its even got an ear designed on the back to help it go that extra mile. Inwardly, I thought the picture recreations were done well, but the inking looks a bit too computer generated. This somewhat defeats the "ancient quality" in my mind. I also had a little bit of a problem with the book having an introduction in it (when I imagine Necronomicon Ex Mortis, I never saw it with an introduction in English) and a nice, fat declaration of copyright on the first pictorial page. And people wonder why they want to take us one by one. Still, I could overlook these minor things and still be very happy with the product because, outwardly at least, its the book of the dead.</p></body></html>

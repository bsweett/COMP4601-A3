<meta name="summary" content="A Tragic case of all style . . ."></head><body><p>I saw the original. What took me back some is the fact that the plot of why the ghosts are in the island town is totally unrelated from one another. Plus, I really didn't like the whole random choosing of the victums.<br /><br />I could see how they had watched the original and said, "we can do this much better given the technology we have now."<br /><br />But did they really have to sacrifice story.<br /><br />The characters even have little differences but not many. They are all, collectively, your typical scared townies that don't know what's going on and just wander around when it comes to solving it. The style of the film was executed perfectly, though. I can never get enough of the images. But there just needs to be mory story.<br /><br />plus, it's just too short when it comes right down to it.<br /><br />Final Verdict: The plot gets lost in the fog.<br /><br />But, hey, that's just my perspective. You might like it better than I did.</p></body></html>

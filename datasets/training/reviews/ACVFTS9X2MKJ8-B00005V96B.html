No other movie, ever, has invented a story of incredible uniqueness, such as this.<br /><br />Imagine, a power plant.  And how it runs is by monster's going through doors, to go into children's room's and scaring them in their sleep.  The screams of the children fill cylinders that are attached to the door's outside.  The louder the scream, the more power has been collected.  Monster's compete with each other to become "scarer of the month".  And the power plant employees (the monsters) all have to avoid contamination. Which, in this case, is having the children they scare or any of the children's belongings (socks, toys, etc.) touch them.<br /><br />I believe that this film was made for an adult audience.  Not that it's vulgar or suggestive, but only because of it's about a power plant (something that children wouldn't care about).  And all the basic routines of working at a power plant that may obviously be far beyond a typical child's comprehension.<br /><br />This film is so "out there!"  I absolutely love it.  And it looks so good on a high-definition TV and my high definition digital-to-digital HDMI DVD player.  It's a great demonstration DVD for my awesome new TV.</p></body></html>

I didn't know it was from the "Matrix" crowd, a film I very much enjoyed.  If anything I thought it was one of those dumb Batman, Spiderman super-hero movies that offer light entertainment - the artistic equivalent of cotton candy.  What I found instead was that rarest of all creatures, a blockbuster film with wonderful production values that entertains and actually engages the mind by posing interesting and difficult questions.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving does more with his voice and movements than most actors do with their entire toolkit; he was perfectly cast as the man behind the mask.  Natalie Portman is excellent as the reluctant co-conspirator, drawn into V's world.  Stephen Rea is downright great as Chief Inspector Finch, our "everyman" figure who must sort through the rubble to dislodge truth.  John Hurt seems to be channeling William Smith from 1984, with a soupcon of Hitler, his frenzy and fury are thoroughly convincing.<br /><br />What makes the film so brave and unusual is that, in our nervous age, it actually casts a terrorist as hero.  This is heady stuff and reminds us that, "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."  V presents an interesting blend of instant karma, righteous vengeance, and social idealism.  Though his motives are personal, he does understand them in a larger context.  His handoff to Portman at the finish recalls the desire of Generals to create a world where their children can study philosophy.<br /><br />V is unlike many movies in that it has a superb 2nd act.  Portman's time in the faux prison, and the powerful epistolary relationship with the unseen individual one cell over, provide this film with a compelling underlying humanity.  Political references abound in V, as do film references, and they all serve to reinforce the core idea that governments really are created to serve people, not vice versa, and when that ceases to be the case, something must be done.  Perhaps the discomfort surrounding this film would be diminished if we all recalled that's precisely what our beloved founding fathers did.</p></body></html>

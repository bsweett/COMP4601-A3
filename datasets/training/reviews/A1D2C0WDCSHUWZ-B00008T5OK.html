<meta name="summary" content="A beautiful story that veers from fairy-tale to gritty"></head><body><p>Now WHAT can I say about this movie that a thousand others haven't said? That despite the fact that it is sappy and a bit obvious, it's also witty, funny, touching, and endearing. You will want to BE Maria!<p>Maria is a high-spirited young nun who is always late, always skipping and singing and sprinting around, and she's driving the solemner nuns up the wall. The Mother Superior knows that her place is not a convent, and so sends her for a time to be the governess to the Baron Von Trapp's seven kids.<p>Baron Von Trapp (played to perfection by Christopher Plummer) is a widower, who has emotionally closed himself off, and treats his bouncy bunch of kids like military ship crew: They have to march, line up for inspection, and respond INSTANTLY, no matter where they are, to the blast of a whistle. Maria is shocked by this, and quickly tries to give the kids love and affection and FUN. The kids respond to this new treatment by becoming fiercely attached to Maria, despite their father's attachment to the beautiful, blond, completely uninteresting Baroness Schraeder. <p>Naturally, that isn't all of the plot. There are love stories and stories about runaways, and the Nazis loom over all of it.<p>The kids are amazing, from energetic teen Liesl to amazingly (but not cloyingly) cute Gretl. All of the kids are perfectly normal: Gretl announcing that she got her finger caught &quot;in Friedrich's teeth&quot;; Liesl's attraction to a young Nazi; Friedrich's musings on what grass tastes like. Liesl has been my favorite for a very long time.<p>Plummer is excellent, he's alternately tender (with hardly a word said) and strict, loving and cold. But what shines through all the time is Von Trapp's moral sense, and determination not to help the Nazis. Julie Andrews is bright and effervescent, turning from a grown-up girl into a woman before our eyes. <p>And the actress playing Baroness Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) is a very low-key note--you hate her whenever you see her, with her smooth manners and speech and appearance. Her talk with Maria made me gag. Then, in her last scene, she surprises everyone.<p>This is a beautiful musical tale with roots in reality, a must-see for everyone.</p></body></html>

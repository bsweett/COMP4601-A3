<meta name="summary" content="Fun enough as a movie, BUT takes many liberties with the book"></head><body><p>I loved the book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and thought it was one of the best in the series. The movie adaptation ,though decent enough on its own, takes far too many liberties with the book, leaving out many crucial plot points.<br /><br />The story in a nutshell - Harry and his friends Ron & Hermione enter their fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and find the school playing host to students from Beaubaxton & Durmstrang schools of magic. The main event of the year is the Triwizard Tournament, where one champion from each school will be selected to participate. Of course, Harry finds himself [without entering his name] being selected to participate as well, and together with the other three selected champions [Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts, Fleur de la Couer from Beaubaxton, and Viktor Krum from Durmstrang] embarks on fulfilling the three tasks set for them, encountering intrigue, danger, and also the very possible rise of a menacing evil in the form of Harry's arch nemesis, Lord Voldemort.<br /><br />As for leaving out crucial plot points, the movie does not develop the strengthening bonds developing between Harry and his godfather Sirius Black, which is very much evident and well-developed in the book. The moviemakers also took a lot of liberties in changing some events to suit the movie, even changing the characters at times [in the book it is Dobby the house elf that helps Harry with the second task, not Neville Longbottom as portrayed in the movie]. There are other quibbles that I shall not enumerate here, for the sake of brevity.<br /><br />That being said, the movie itself is quite fun to watch, I liked the way the Beaubaxtons, and Durmstrangs made their entrance. Also, the underwater scene for Harry's second task in the Triwizard Tournament is superbly done. The actors playing Harry[Dan Radcliffe], Ron {Rupert Grint]& Hermione [Emma Watson] have truly matured in their roles here, and their performances make for compelling viewing. Hermione has blossomed into a beautiful young lady, and the boys too seem to be taking notice of the opposite sex [[both develop crushes], all very natural given that they are now young adolescents. The Yule Ball is depicted beautifully on-screen. The actor playing Mad Eye Moody [the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher] is quite a treat to watch, with his weird goggling eye, and mannerisms.<br /><br />The CGI effects are impressive as with the other Potter films -there are dragons, grindylows [water demons] etc to entertain viewers.Overall, though this is a fun movie, I still prefer the previous three in the Harry Potter franchise, mostly because the first three tried their best to stay faithful to the books, and this one took too many liberties[though I admit at over 700 pages long, it is a bit hard to include every single important detail]. Nevertheless, I would recommend adding it to your collection if you're a fan of the series.</p></body></html>

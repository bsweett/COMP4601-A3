The filming is uninspired, owing a large debt to the techniques Ridley Scott used to much better dramatic effect in Gladiator.  The plot is as skimpy as the outfit Keira Knightley wears for the final showdown between Arthur's knights and the Saxons.  Knightley's eye candy Guenivere provides one of the few bright spots in a film that is otherwise difficult to watch.  Arthur and most of his knights seem grossly miscast, and Clive Owen simply cannot carry off the role as this larger than life hero.  Stellan Skarsgard pulls off a moderately good performance as the leader of the Saxons, but inexplicably speaks with a distinctly American accent.<br /><br />I rented the director's cut, which presumably represents the artist's vision of the final movie.  This film is exemplary of why studios often make dramatic changes to a director's work.  The film is grossly overlong, somehow deluding itself into believeing that a long run-time somehow equates to an epic film event--and the film's almost nonexistent plot seems only to serve as a device to get the combatants to their next battle sequence.<br /><br />Thoroughly uninspired, this film does little to expound upon the mystery of the Arthurian legend as its opening titles promise.  Instead, it winds up being a loosely confederated group of battle sequences, which, while occasionally eye-catching, are often gruesome and gratuitous, and usually fail to advance the story, which is what this film is most in need of.  All in all, a huge waste of time for a person who does not have time to waste.  Very disappointing.</p></body></html>

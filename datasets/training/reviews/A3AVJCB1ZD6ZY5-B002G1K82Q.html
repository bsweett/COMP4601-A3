"Across the Universe" takes songs composed by the Beatles and sets them into the real world environment of the 60's reinforcing the poignant and sometimes psychodelic images.<br /><br />Jude (Jim Sturgess) is a Liverpool lad who signs up as a sailor and then jumps ship in the US in order to find his Dad, who he believed to be a Princeton professor.  What he finds instead is a janitor who really doesn't want a son to come into his new life.  Max (Jim Carrigan) a Princeton frat boy who's tired of college and ready to hit the scene invites him home for Thanksgiving, which Jude has never celebrated and really doesn't know much about.  Over the turkey and dressing, he meets Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) Max's sister, who is in love with a soldier boy gone off to war.<br /><br />When Max feels rejected by his family, he and Jude decide to go to New York City and Greenwich Village.  That's where the real adventure begins.  Both the War Machine and the Peace Movement are clearly depicted.  In the meantime, Lucy loses her soldier boy and comes to join the two.<br /><br />There's enough humor (bad Beatles song puns, among other things) to keep you laughing after the inevitable shock and tears.  Overall, I thought this film was beautifully filmed and well acted.  Kudos to the cast and crew for such a well-thought-out film.</p></body></html>

Deniro, once again, is such an amzing actor and presence that you can't help but be in awe of him.  Pesci plays almost an identical character to the one in Goodfellas - except for a small change in accent.  However, this little guy is still one bad man!  I still believe that this is Sharon Stone's only good movie.  Ironically, she doesn't have to disrobe to earn that status.<p>The plot, like most mob movies, is easy to predict - but I don't care.  They could churn these out every year and I would still be there in the theater - aluminum bat in hand of course!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Go Balls Deep!"></head><body><p>"If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball."<br /><br />"Your about as useful as a poopy flavored lollipop!"<br /><br />- the coach for the "Average Joe's" gives some helpless advice in "Dodgeball"<br /><br />Vince Vaughn & Ben Stiller star in a film that has balls as big as churchbells. "Dodgeball" is the type of sophmoronic comedy that works along the style of "The Bad News Bears", and any other sports comedy, but, without the gross out gags (with the exception of the overweight Stiller scenes).<br /><br />Vaughn owns "Average Joe's Gym", a decrepit, rundown gym that if Joe owned it, he would probably shoot himself. With most of the members not paying there monthly membership, "Avg. Joe's" hasn't made a penny in almost a year.<br /><br />Stiller plays the owner of "Globo-Gym", a "Golds Gym" style franchise, that's preparing to buy out "Average Joe's" and turn the gym into a parking lot. Vaughn has thirty days to cough up fifty grand and save his gym. A plan formulates when the Joe's of the gym decide to enter into a dodgeball tournament with fifty g's as the grand prize. All bets are off when Stiller, & his "Globo-homos" buy there way into the tournament, planning to crush "Average Joe's" financially and physically.<br /><br />"Dodgeball" has plenty of laughs. Vince Vaughn is at his best (you actually root for the poor shlub). Ben Stiller is o.k. as the "Globo" gym owner and has enough retarded arrogance to scare off his real life wife (she's the lawyer turned dodgeball MVP who helps the "Joe's"). Jason Bateman makes a good cameo as a burnt out announcer.<br /><br />The DVD features include deleted scenes, trailers, easter eggs, and director commentary</p></body></html>

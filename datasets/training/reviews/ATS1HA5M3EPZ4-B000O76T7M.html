<meta name="summary" content="Let's get ready to Rumbbllleee!"></head><body><p>In this corner, at 7'2" and weighing in at 323 pounds, the planet hopping, ritualistic hunter who made mince meat of an entire Special Ops Squad led by the Governor of California as well as a Los Angeles police force, the clef-lipped ferocity of The Predator!  And in the other corner, weighing in at 314 pounds...at about 6'8"...not including the tail...the one who not only brought Sigorney Weaver to her knees, but made a group of Future High Tech Marines look like babies, the scourge of all animals in the galaxy, the acid bleeding, multiple mandible, he'll go in through your face and come out of your stomach, how-does-he-see-with-no-eyes...THE ALIEN!<br /><br />Ok enough of that, as for the movie; surprisingly I found myself really liking this movie long after I watched it.  I did like it when I was watching it, but the more I thought about it afterward the more I liked it.  The plot is actually pretty smart and the action scenes are great, especially the fight scenes involving the Alien and Predator.  But alas, the actors are second-rate nobodies with the exception of Lance Henriksen.  What Alien movie would be complete without him?  It really helps tie them all together.  Plus, it makes you wonder, was Bishop made in his image?  The other Alien movies where set in the future, this one is set in the present, so we know the Alien race is living on in corners of the universe.  This is a dominating creature; all it does is kill and breed.<br /><br />The story starts as the satellite of a rich industrialist picks up a heat signature in a remote island off the coast of Antarctica, 2000 feet below the surface.  A team of experts is quickly pulled together to find out what it is.  As a note, just because the actors are unknown, doesn't mean they aren't decent.  The lead character, an environmental expert/explorer played by Sanaa Lathan, shows strength, determination and tenacity...everything a young actor wants to show off.  She gets to run, jump and tell the lead character that they aren't ready for this expedition that will take them to unknown areas of the earth.  What happens next may seem predictable, but the twists and turns that come with it are actually surprising and entertaining.<br /><br />If you didn't like any of the franchise movies, you may not like this one.  But if you were a fan of the Dark Horse comics and/or the movies, this one will keep your attention till the end.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Santa Claus: Man of Mystery"></head><body><p>The delightful award-winning book "The Polar Express" has been turned into one of the most delightful films I've ever seen. I have since read many reviews that make me glad I watched the film before reading the reviews: some of the delight comes from being surprised by events in the film that wouldn't be a surprise if I had read them first.<br /><br />This film looks like nothing I've ever seen.  The combination of "motion-capture" acting and animation results in a look that is much more "real" looking than traditional (or even Pixar) animation, but much more stylized than simple live-action filming.  For this story - it's a perfect marriage of "story" and "look".<br /><br />To avoid spoiling the "surprises" I'll only encapsulate the first few moments.  A boy is at that age when the existence of Santa Claus is very much in question.  After all - Santa would have to fly faster than the speed of light with a bag of toys larger than an ocean liner to cover his appointed rounds.  He lies awake on Christmas Eve, waiting to hear a sound a friend has told him he will never hear - the sound of sleighbells on Santa's sleigh.<br /><br />The movie begins weaving it's magic spell from the opening seconds.  Although it's a stylized animation, it gets the most minute details exactly "right".  This is a film that knows how new-fallen snow crunches under your feet.  It knows how a kid will check the milk and cookies left for Santa for evidence of whether or not the jolly old gent has come by.  It knows how a kid will fake being asleep when the parents come in to check on you when you're SUPPOSED to be asleep.  It's a movie that knows what it is to question, and what it means to have faith.  Another thing this movie understands is that at the North Pole - Santa is a really big thing.  It's one thing to meet Santa at your local mall, but if you were going to meet him at the North Pole, wouldn't that be just a little bit bigger?<br /><br />As our hero boy lies awake in bed the whole house suddenly rumbles as if an earthquake were in progress.  He rushes outside to find a huge gleaming train.  The conductor (looking an awful lot like Tom Hanks - Mr. Hanks provides voice to six characters) calls out and asks the boy if he's going to get on board.  The boy asks where the train is going.<br /><br />"Why, the North Pole, of course!  This is the Polar Express!"<br /><br />The conductor sizes up the boy and astutely observes that the boy is at that time when he begins to not believe.  "If I were you, I'd get on board", he advises the boy.<br /><br />This is a movie that understands the transition from believing to questioning, and it understands the importance of not giving up the faith.<br /><br />If I were you - I'd watch this movie.  And be prepared for it to become one of your favorites.</p></body></html>

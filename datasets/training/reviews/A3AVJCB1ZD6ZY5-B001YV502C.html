The second youngest person is a woman only a few weeks older...and there have been no children since.<br /><br />Britain seems to be the one place that everyone wants to go and the UK Immigrations people have an illegal alien problem that'd put the TX border to shame.<br /><br />"Fishes" are a group of radicals who want every British immigrant to have equal rights.<br /><br />The one pawn in this game is a young Fiji woman who is pregnant.  Radicals are trying to sneak her out of the country onto a mythical ship called "Tomorrow" where human reproduction is being studied.<br /><br />The story's fast-paced and fascinating.  You really didn't dare get up to get a drink or lose attention or you'd miss an important detail. The acting was particularly good-Michael Caine as an aging hippie type was wonderful.<br /><br />I definitely need to read PD James' book so I can understand some of the concepts better.  In many ways, I wish I had seen this film in the theatre--yes, it's worth full price.</p></body></html>

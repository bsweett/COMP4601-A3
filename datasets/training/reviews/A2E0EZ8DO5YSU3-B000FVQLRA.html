It is well acted and well photographed, but the Brody character is just not very interesting.  This guy escapes the holocaust through the efforts of a series of other people, does very little to help himself other than scrounge for food, does essentially nothing to save others and shows little gratitude towards the people who help him.  There are seemingly endless scenes of Brody sleeping or staring out a window.  This is a yawner.  There must be a lot of politics behind all the awards this film got.</p></body></html>

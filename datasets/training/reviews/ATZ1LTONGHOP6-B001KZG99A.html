Upon returning to the United States, Stark improves on his super-suit and then sets about trying to correct all of the damage he has done through the sales of weapons.<br /><br />I did not expect to like "Iron Man". I have seen a lot of superhero films in my life and I usually find that the acting is second-rate and the endings are irritatingly open-ended. The only reason why I went to see "Iron Man" at all was because my father wanted to see it and I just went along to keep him company. I'm now glad that I did, because it is a surprisingly good film.<br /><br />I have always considered Robert Downey Jr. to be an excellent actor (I still think he should have won the Best Actor Oscar for "Chaplin") and his performance in "Iron Man" is no exception. Downey turns in one of his best performances in years and is ably supported by Jeff Bridges as the film's villain. Furthermore, the film's ending provides enough closure so that this film can stand by itself without sequels (although, I am certain that the film's makers would be more than happy to continue the franchise).<br /><br />The film's script is filled with the sort of light-hearted bantering that is typical of a Robert Downey Jr. film but also has a point to make about the culpability of weapons manufacturers. I particularly liked the fact that this film was set in the real world, rather than in a universe that exists almost parallel to our reality, like "Batman" or "Superman". My main criticism of this film is that it is just so predictable. Some of the plot twists I could see coming for almost an hour before they eventuated.<br /><br />Overall, this film is definitely worth your time and money. "Iron Man" is targeted at a more mature audience than films such as "Spiderman" or "X-Men", but it still should appeal to viewers of all ages. And if you do go and see it, make sure you stay until the end of the credits. Although the credits are very long, as has been pointed out by other reviewers, those who do sit through them are rewarded by an extra scene at the end of them, which is definitely worth the wait.</p></body></html>

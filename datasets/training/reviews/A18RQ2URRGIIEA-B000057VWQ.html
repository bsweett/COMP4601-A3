Arguably, one of the best films of all time, "It's a Wonderful Life" tells the story of a fictional character named George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart, 1908-1997) who lives in the small, fictional town of Bedford Falls, NY.  George, as a young boy (played by Robert Anderson), dreamed of world travel and being an archetect, but the death of his father (Samuel S. Hinds, 1875-1948) forces him to remain in Bedford Falls in order to manage the Bailey Savings & Loan.  Though feeling trapped, he eventually marries Mary (Donna Reed, 1921-1986) and has four children.  Barely able to take care of his family, George is tempted by offer for a high-paying job by his chief rival,  the unscrupulous Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore, 1878-1954), but rejects it.  Finally, the pressure becomes too much for George when his absentminded Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell, 1892-1962) loses money that was supposed to be deposited in Potter's bank and George is accused of embezzlement.  Feeling completely lost & helpless, George decides to plunge from a bridge into a dark & cold river; but suddenly, someone else falls in and George instinctively jumps in to save the other man's life.  The other man, however, is no man at all; but a guardian angel named Clarence (Henry Travers, 1874-1965) sent to save George.  Not believing that Clarence is an angel, George wishes that he had never been born and Clarence grants him his wish.  When George returns to Bedford Falls, what he finds is the unseemly town of Pottersville: filled with nightclubs, pawnshops and other disreputable businesses.  Further, no one knows George anymore.  Horrified, George desperately attempts to find Mary, his children and his mother; but what he finds only gets George into trouble with the people who had once known him including his two dearest friends: the taxi driver Ernie Bishop (Frank Faylen, 1905-1985) and police officer Bert (Ward Bond, 1903-1960).  Will George get his life back, along with his wife, children & friends?  You'll just have to watch (if you haven't already) this classic film to find out.<br /><br />With a brilliant story, wonderful direction thanks to Frank Capra (1897-1991) and superb acting, "It's a Wonderful Life" remains one of the most loved & watched films of the last 60 years.  The filmed earned 5 Oscar nominations in 1947, including Jimmy Stewart for Best Actor and Frank Capra for Best Director and for Best Picture.  Other memorable characters include George's mother (Beulah Bondi, 1888-1981), Mr. Gower (H.B. Warner, 1875-1958), George's daughter Zuzu (Karolyn Grimes), George's brother Harry (Todd Karns, 1921-2000) and Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame, 1923-1981).  Overall, "It's a Wonderful Life" gets a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and I highly recommend it to everyone.  Though originally filmed in black and white, the film was colorized several years ago. While some don't approve of the colorization of older films, it's nice to see this DVD package offering both the original black & white version, as well as the colorized version for people to watch.</p></body></html>

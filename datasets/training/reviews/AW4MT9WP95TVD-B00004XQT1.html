Bale is excellent at depicting a character who has become so shallow and empty that he rebels in his American Psycho way.  Scenes like Bateman in the shower and his morning prep routine and the business card comparisons are hysterical in the way the point out some of the absurdities and foolishness of this era.  Bale is so slick and so wired in his extremes in behaviour and his voice over dialogues are performed to perfection. It is so subversively witty - that the social aspects of this time come across as almost more scary than the violence.  Were we that bad?  Other performances are great here too: dafoe, mathis, leto, and Chloe Sevigny who is the only one who can actually steal her scenes away from Bale.  I used to work with a bunch of Patrick Batemans who had too much too early and too easy - I wonder what happened to them.</p></body></html>

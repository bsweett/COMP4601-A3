<meta name="summary" content="Okay but falls way short of the first two films"></head><body><p>Spider-Man 3 has been hyped as the best of the trilogy. I have to respectfully disagree. While not bad, it is the WEAKEST of the trilogy. On its own, its a good film but when compared to the first two (especially Spider-Man 2), it falls short. Here is my take:<br /><br />PROS - James Franco's portrayal of Harry Osborn remains strong here. His "New Goblin" is arguably the best villian in this film though he later turns good to help Spidey against The Sandman and Venom. Also, I found this one to be funnier in spots than the first two. Particularly Tobey Maguire's performance as "Bad Peter" when he acquires his black suit. The dance scene in the club was amazing and probably one of the better non-super scenes in the film! I also thought that the Sandman was handled well. The CG's for him were incredible!<br /><br />CONS - Speaking of Maquire, his and Kirsten Dunst's performances were still good but not as strong here. I blame that more in the writing though. Not enough Aunt May or J. Jonah Jameson in this one too.<br /><br />Bottom line here is this, there was too much stuff crammed into one film. In other words, some of this stuff could've easily been held over for a Spider-Man 4 if not for contractual concerns. I personally would've had just the Sandman and the black costume situation here and held Venom for a fourth film. Speaking of Venom, his character development was very rushed in my opinion. Another film could've fleshed him out much better!<br /><br />Overall, this film isn't a waste of money BUT I'd get it at a reduced price. While nowhere near as bad as some other superhero films such as Hulk, Daredevil (theatrical version/not the uncut), Batman & Robin (1997), Superman IV, Spawn and Steel, it falls way short of the first two Spidey films! I enjoyed the two Fantastic Four movies more than I did this one and that's sad!<br /><br />If you are a family oriented viewer however, then its probably the most moral of the 3 films. Not that the other two weren't virtuious but this one seems to make a point about morality without shoving it down your throat.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd get it at a reduced price or part of that 3-pack that comes with the first two movies. Even with this weak offering however, I am glad I was around to see my favorite childhood comic hero come to life in these three films.</p></body></html>

Unfortunately, I think the two-disk one is going out of print.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I don't think I'll be watching it again:  I know you're supposed to suspend your disbelief before you pop in a movie like this, but watching it in middle age, I couldn't get around the plot holes.  They were simply too enormous.  Sure, I know it's a classic movie and all.  And sure, when I was a teenager this really fired my imagination.<br /><br />But this time around, the only thing I marveled at was how hoodwinked I had been before at such second-rate entertainment.  In this case, the plot-hole that triggered my dissatisfaction was the fact that Heston wasn't struck at all by the fact that the apes spoke English.  At least in Boulle's book, they spoke another language which he slowly had to learn.<br /><br />I know that sounds like a minor matter, but once you start to notice that, a whole lot of other things seem to go wrong, until the point where you're just rolling your eyes instead of taking the movie on its own merits.<br /><br />Another thing that seemed completely off was the direction:  think of the crashing-to-earth scene.  I realize they had a limited budget, but that has got to be some of the most inept direction I've ever seen.</p></body></html>

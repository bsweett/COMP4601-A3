<meta name="summary" content="Beautifully filmed - Nice Story - Good, twist ending"></head><body><p>Filmed in some of the most beautiful and picturesque places in Europe, "The Illusionist" is a cross between magic and love.<br /><br />Edward Norton is a charismatic and gifted magician, Eisenhiem, while is love interest, Jessica Biel, Dutchess Sophie van Teschen, is an aristocrat with whom he is not supposed to interact.<br /><br />This film is brilliantly dark at parts, keeping just enough mystery to entice the viewer, but revealing tidbits that encourage the magic, the mystery.  Eisenhiem (Norton), has learned so much that he can trick and convince even the harshest critics and cynics, going so far as to upstage a crown prince, Leopold, the man in line for the crown, and the man vying for Biel's hand in marriage.  Eisenhiem seems to be one step ahead at all times, ready for the inquisitive and the doubters, even the Inspector General, the man who is supposed to know all secrets of the area.<br /><br />What eventually happens is that the Prince orders the Inspector General, Uhl, to shut down Eisenhiem's show, because the Prince doesn't like the competition.  While doing so, however, he pushes the love-triangle ahead, causing a death, some unbelievable magic (conjuring of spirits) that sways the masses, and a devious, albeit somewhat forseeable twist, that is sure to entertain.</p></body></html>

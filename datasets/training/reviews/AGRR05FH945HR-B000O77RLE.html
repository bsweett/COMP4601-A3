(Longfellow)<br /><br />Eastwood's masterpiece certainly humanizes the WW II Japanese military in a way that few movies ever have. I would however suggest watching Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (Oshima) for an insight into their appalling treatment of Allied prisoners of war, which cannot be ignored.<br /><br />An immensely talented Japanese cast, headed by the superb Watanabe and Ninomiya, bring these characters to life in a way that renders this an unforgettable movie.<br /><br />In a career filled with excellence, this to me is Eastwood's finest hour.<br /><br />Outstanding.</p></body></html>

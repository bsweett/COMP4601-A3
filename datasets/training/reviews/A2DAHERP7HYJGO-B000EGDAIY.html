Yes I know that this genre is not considered cerebral enough for most reviewers. But it is one that I love and have loved since childhood. Every thing from low budget movies like SQUIRM to high profile items like THE EXORCIST. That being said, it should come as no surprise that after numerous viewings of all things horrific, there is little to see that I would consider actually scary. Until tonight.<br /><br />The story is based around a Japanese legend that when someone dies under brutal or highly emotional circumstances, a curse is placed on that location that carries on to those who visit the site. After witnessing such an occurrence, we are introduced to Karen (Sarah Michelle Geller), a young woman living in Japan with her student boyfriend, who works as a care giver/nurse. Sent to the house where the first young nurse was killed (we know this but no one else does just yet), Karen is exposed to the ghosts that haunt the house, including a small boy and a terrifying lady with long black hair.<br /><br />Her charge found dead along with the couple who own the house, Karen is taken to a hospital. The movie plays fast and loose with moving in time and space to tell its story and it works well this way. We see these victims before they were killed, find out how they came to the house, find out the connection (only slightly at first) between a man who killed himself at the very beginning of the movie and this family and we find out more about the little boy. We are also treated to the grisly deaths of all, including the sister of the couple.<br /><br />It is through the use of storytelling, information that Karen finds online and later a discussion with the police detective assigned to the case, that we garner the whole story. And we learn why this apparition is haunting Karen as well as the rest.<br /><br />No I won't spoil it for you by giving you the ending. Nor will I offer you the times and places in the film where you are likely to jump out of your seat. Instead, just let me say that there are some truly creepy sequences and sights that will make you skin crawl not to mention make you consider the fact that crawling under the covers may never be the safest thing to do ever again.<br /><br />The movie's pace drags momentarily at times, but picks up again enough to make those spots not even noticeable (I wouldn't have mentioned them here but my wife felt that they were too long). What makes this movie work is that along with the scares that it offers, we have a fountain of story that draws us in as well. The acting is solid and the direction by Takashi Shimizu, who directed the original and its sequel, makes him a talent to watch in the future.</p></body></html>

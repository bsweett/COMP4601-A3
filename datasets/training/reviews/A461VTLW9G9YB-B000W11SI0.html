If you are against all odds, would you give up or keep on fighting for your life ? This is what the man in the movie did. He fought and never gave up. Brilliant movie, cast, story. A real tear jerker. Get the tissues and soak it in. Adrian Brody deserved the Oscar. A MASTERPIECE INDEED</p></body></html>

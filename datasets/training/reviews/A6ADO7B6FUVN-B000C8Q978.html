<meta name="summary" content="Jarmusch Delivers Melancholic Existence Through Brilliant Tale..."></head><body><p>For the uninitiated, Jim Jarmusch cinematic creations are full of existentialism and messages left for the audience to ponder.  The films are philosophically dense where there are no single true answers to Jarmusch's questions, yet each viewer will have to strive to find their own interpretation.  All of his adventures contain a deeper meaning such as the transcending Mystery Train (1989) where people pass through Memphis to the spiritual Western, Dead Man (1995) with Johnny Depp, while Jarmusch also touches on eastern philosophy in Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999).  Broken Flowers continues on the path that Jarmusch has laid out for himself without deviating from his thoughtful guidance to cerebral enlightenment.<br /><br />There are several reasons why Jarmusch's films are fascinating.  One of the reasons is his visual sense of capturing the essence of time and place, which he efficiently makes use of in the opening of Broken Flowers.  The first scene allows the audience to see a hand mailing a pink personal letter, which is then followed through the technology of the postal services until it arrives in the mailbox of Don Johnston (Bill Murray).  There are numerous scenes where Jarmusch allows a motionless camera to capture Don's current existence, which brings out the melancholic state that he is experiencing.  The first impression might be boredom, for the audience, but if the audience submerges themselves into the story with thoughtfulness they will discover a gem among cinema that deals with existentialism.<br /><br />Another reason why Jarmusch makes his films interesting is the characters that he has in his film.  In this film, Don is a has-been Don Juan with countless number of ex-girlfriends who has lived a life in the moment and never seized the opportunity to plan for the future.  This seems to bother him, as he often remains immobile, which suggests that he is in a contemplative state.  Yet, he never reaches any conclusions, as nothing ever seem to change around him.  For something to happen, an external event must take place that forces him to do something, and in this case it is the pink letter.  The story surrounds the pink letter, which he opens in the company with his Ethiopian neighbor and friend Winston (Jeffrey Wright).  Through the letter Don finds out that he has a son with a woman he met some 20 years ago, but she kept it a secret until now.  However, the letter does not disclose anything in regards to who sent it, or where it comes from.  Thus, Winston coerces Don to solve the mystery and find the mother, which is easier said than done.<br /><br />Winston's forcefulness ushers Don to begin something he would never have done by himself, as Winston asks him to write a list of the women that he thinks could be the possible mothers.  With the help of Internet and Mapquest.com Winston finds the women and he produce an extensive traveling plan for Don to see all the women.  Don sets off to find the women while listening to Winston's home burnt CD with Ethiopian modern music, which helps generate the mystifying atmosphere that often lingers in Jarmusch's films.  It becomes a journey into Don's past, as he seems to find the things that drew him to these women.  Furthermore, the audience will discover the similarities among the women, which in itself offers additional amusement.<br /><br />Broken Flowers plays with visual symbolism in regards to how the environment and people change with time while it is experienced in the present, as Don ponders the future and visits the past.  Bill Murray's performance might feel familiar with Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and Lost in Translation (2003), however, he deals with different issues in this film and succeeds in pulling off a unique performance.  In addition, there are several strong performances by several actors including Jeffrey Wright, Sharon Stone, Jessica Lange, Tilda Swinton and many others who enhance the silent and melancholic character that Bill Murray presents.  Under Jarmusch's direction the actors deliver dry comedy with moments of laughter, but also a more meaningful existence where he leaves the audience to think about the philosophical possibilities of the past, present, and future.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A great family film"></head><body><p>The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a great family film that I watched with my 5yr old and 2yr old and it held their interest the entire time.  I don't recall the book (read it 25 years ago) but the movie was great.  Narnia is a beautiful place and all of C.S. Lewis' characters are wonderfully done.  The actors that play the kids could have been better but they do a good job.  The fight at the end isn't that intense, but the execution of Aslan is pretty rough for kids.  This film is definitely one to add to the collection.</p></body></html>

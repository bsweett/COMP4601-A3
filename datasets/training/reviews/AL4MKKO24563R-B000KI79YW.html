<meta name="summary" content="Decent thriller"></head><body><p>The Sentinel contains parts of many other movies, most notably the superior In the Line of Fire, starring Clint Eastwood which was also about an assassination attempt on the President and the Secret Service agents who try to thwart it. The cast is very good -- Michael Douglas, Kiefer Sutherland, Eva Longoria and Kim Basinger -- and the film is well written and directed. Douglas plays a secret service agent who is having an affair with the First Lady (Basinger). The secret service gets wind of an assassination plot that is to be carried out by a mole in the secret service. Douglas is accused of being the mole and must find the real traitor in order to clear his name and save the President. It's never boring and holds the audience's interest, but it's like a fast food meal you forget about right after you eat it. It seems as if Douglas has a clause in the contract of every film he does that he has to have an affair with at least one beautiful woman. Sutherland's agent is a close relative of Jack Bauer on 24. Basinger is beautiful as usual and convincingly portray's the First Lady vulnerability, but its same old, same old for her. Eva Longoria comes off very well as Sutherland's assistant. She clearly proves that she's much more than her sex kitten image from Desperate Housewives. However, most everything else is pretty standard. Overall, good, not great.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Munich"></head><body><p>At the 1972 Olympics in Munich, the terrorist group Black September kidnapped and murdered some Israeli atheletes.  This is the story of Isreal's response to this horrific event.  Avner (Bana) is chosen to lead a five-man team of ex-Mossad agents that are to track down and assassinate the 11 Palestinians responsible for the attack.  They are working unofficially for the government, through their handler, Ephraim (Rush), who provides them money and information.  For Avner, this is patriotism, and a chance to serve his country.<br /><br />The team travels the world locating and eliminating their targets.  He becomes focused and begins to lose himself with each passing murder.  Also, the hunters become the hunted, and soon they are guarding their own lives as well as trying to finish the job.  Plus, Black September begins retaliating, forcing Avner to question their actions and if those actions are actually making things better or worse.<br /><br />"Munich" is an excellent movie, showing a story that is very relevant today.  It is thought provoking and engaging.  Eric Bana is amazing as the conscience-tortured Avner who just wants to do the right thing.  His team (especially the new James Bond, Daniel Craig) are all excellent in their roles.  The story is fast paced, and full of action.  Director Stephen Speilberg has crafted another masterpiece.  "Munich" is an important film that I highly recommend be seen by all.</p></body></html>

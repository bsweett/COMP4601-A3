Charlize's light is hidden under the bushel of a director who evidently thinks a story can be told without requiring any emotion from the characters. Aeon (Theron) and all the other main characters are flat and awfully boring. The simplistic story about the evils of cloning seems much longer than its 92 minutes. The fight sequences are heavily edited, just so much smoke and shadow -- no real martial arts expertise. Skip Aeon Flux and give Ultraviolet a try. That is a much more creative film.</p></body></html>

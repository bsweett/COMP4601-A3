<meta name="summary" content="A Barrel of Fun"></head><body><p>What a hoot!  "The Hangover" is a rollercoaster of fun.  Often unpredictable but always refreshing and off beat; this is a very funny film.<br /><br />Four friends go to Vegas a few days before the impending marriage of one of them.  And they are four very different people: a school teacher, a nerdy dentist, a fat weirdo and the soon to be betrothed.  The night begins with drinks on the roof of "Caesar's Palace" where they hope for a night to remember.  Unfortunately, their drinks have been fixed with a date rape drug and, the next morning, they can remember nothing.  To make matters worse, one of them has gone missing and it's the one who's getting married in another day.  Their task is to reconstruct the events of the previous night and, in so doing, locate their friend.<br /><br />What a night!  They have found a baby, stolen a tiger, one of them has been married and lost a tooth, visited a hospital and driven off with a police car; and they can't remember a thing.  The next day is also a barrel of fun.  They encounter hoodlums, they are blackmailed, tasered by the police and have an encounter with Mike Tyson.<br /><br />I've probably said too much already.  However, I dare anyone to put these clues together without having seen the film.  Let's leave it at that.  See this film and laugh.</p></body></html>

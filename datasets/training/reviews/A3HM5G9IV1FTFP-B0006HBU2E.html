I just watched the first two films in the series for the first time last weekend after years of avoiding them. My impression? That so far, the "Bourne" films deserve all of the praise and success that they've received.<br /><br />What we have here is an intelligent, engrossing, well-written, well-acted and well-directed action film that can be enjoyed by families and mainstream audiences, but that doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence. I have to give props ... pulling that off is not easy to do.<br /><br />In the second film of the series, "The Bourne Supremacy", Jason Bourne finds that, despite the fact that he still can't recall most of it, he cannot escape his past. Although managing for two years to live in seclusion with his girlfriend, he is drawn back into the violent world he tried to escape when he is hunted down by another "Treadstone" agent, who fails to murder Bourne but kills his girlfriend. (The underwater scene where Jason watches Marie's lifeless body float away is tender and beautifully sad). Bourne is then framed by the same corrupt CIA agent (Brian Cox) who used to run the "Treadstone" program that created Bourne, and Jason is forced to prove his innocence while still trying to figure out his past.<br /><br />Matt Damon is the thinking man's action hero, and a complete departure from the stereotypically cocky, wisecracking American hero type. In action, Bourne is precise, powerful and unstoppable, but when he's not, Damon plays him with the stoic vulnerability of a man who wants desperately to escape the violent past he can barely remember. When Bourne tracks down the offspring of a politician he assassinated in his former life, the scene is heartbreakingly restrained. Bravo.</p></body></html>

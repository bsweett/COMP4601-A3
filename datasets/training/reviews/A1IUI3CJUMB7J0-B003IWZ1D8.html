<meta name="summary" content="The best horror movie ever...One of the best films of all time"></head><body><p>Some movies we still talk about even though they where relesed over 50 years ago for example Gone with the wind, Ben-Hur, It's a wonderfull life and some others and then there is Psycho. The mother of all horror films is still the best of them all. The first real slasher flick and shock movie to be relesed. Everything about the movie is good the story, the excellent direction, the acting and the great score. The movie should of won best picture, director for Hitchcock, acting for Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. A great film that is still great to this day.</p></body></html>

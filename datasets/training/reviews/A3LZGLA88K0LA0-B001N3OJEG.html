Curtis Hanson's brilliant adaptation of the James Ellroy novel did win two Oscars:  it's script by Hanson and Brian Helgeland and supporting actress for Kim Basinger.  But since TITANIC was such a "titanic" hit, LA CONFIDENTIAL lost the Best Picture Oscar, and it should have won.  There's nothing to find wrong in this blistering study of corruption, murder, prostitution and betrayal.  The male performers are simply outstanding:  Guy Pearce is mesmerizing as the idealistic cop who undergoes a metamorphosis; Russell Crowe is the "tough" cop whose fierce loyalty and brutality form his core; James Cromwell as the captain who takes Pearce under his wing; Kevin Spacey as the police consultant for the tv show, "Badge of Honor" and who suddenly sees the light when a male hooker is murdered; David Straithairn as the slimy founder of an elite hooker service; Danny DeVito as the magazine editor always chasing the big scoop; and of course Ms. Basinger who gives new meaning to the "hooker with a heart of gold" cliche.  She's the soft focus in this otherwise brutal film.  Although compared to CHINATOWN, I find LA CONFIDENTIAL an overall more engrossing film; it's rich in period detail, and has a brilliant cast.  Truly a classic film noir!</p></body></html>

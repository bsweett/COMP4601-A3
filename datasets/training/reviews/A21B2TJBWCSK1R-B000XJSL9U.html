<meta name="summary" content="Unrated Special Edition the only way to go"></head><body><p>Fans of the Die Hard franchise were upset when it was announced that this film would be the first one in the series to be rated PG-13, an obvious bid to attract a younger audience. Thankfully, the more violent, profanity-laden unrated version is included on this DVD so that we can watch the film the way it was meant to be seen.<br /><br />The first disc includes an audio commentary by director Len Wiseman, actor Bruce Willis and editor Nicolas De Toth. Right from the get-go, all three men address the studio-imposed PG-13 rating thing and how they went ahead and shot an R rated version anyway. There are quite a few lulls as the three men tend to get caught up watching the film but manage to deliver a fairly decent track.<br /><br />The second starts off with "Analog Hero in a Digital World: Making Live Free or Die Hard," a feature-length documentary that can also be viewed as 10 separate featurettes. Wiseman admits to being a big fan of the series, especially the first one, and this motivated his decision to accept the gig. Various other aspects of the production are covered in detail, including casting the main roles, set design, stunts, editing, visual effects, and sound. This is done in an accessible way that is entertaining and informative.<br /><br />"Yippee Ki Yay Motherf*****!" Filmmaker Kevin Smith interviews Bruce Willis in this fun, entertaining extra. Smith flat out asks Willis why he decided to do yet another Die Hard sequel. He admits that mistakes were made on the second and third films and with this new one he was more conscious about not repeating those mistakes. Smith asks good questions which Willis answers them honestly.<br /><br />There is a music video for "Die Hard" by Guyz Nite, a pop punk band. The song pays tribute to the Die Hard films with a montage of clips from all four films.<br /><br />"Behind the Scenes with Guyz Nite" is forgettable look at this rock band as they talk about themselves and their music.<br /><br />"Fox Movie Channel Presents Fox Legacy" takes a brief look at the Die Hard franchise, giving a little backstory.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.</p></body></html>

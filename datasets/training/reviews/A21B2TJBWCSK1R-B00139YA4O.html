<meta name="summary" content="The way TV on DVD should be represented!"></head><body><p>Clearly the creators of Lost know their audience very well judging by the number of meaty extras that cater to the obsessive fan. These commentaries and featurettes explain a lot about the mechanics of the show without giving away any of the mysteries.<br /><br />On the first DVD, there are audio commentaries for both parts of the "Pilot" episode by executive producers J.J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof and Bryan Burk. They talk briefly about how they pitched the show and take us through the making of the episode. In an interesting moment, Abrams actually stops the episode to show us how they did an explosion in the crash site sequence. These are very informative tracks with lots of anecdotes about filming.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary on "Walkabout" by executive producers Jack Bender and David Fury and actor Terry O'Quinn. Bender talks about the challenge of working with trained wild boars that ate too much and didn't feel like moving in a scene that required them to charge the actors. Unfortunately, O'Quinn doesn't talk much only offering brief insights.<br /><br />The second DVD includes a commentary for "The Moth" by Lindelof, Burk and actor Dominic Monaghan. The Lord of the Rings alum tends to spend most of the time cracking jokes and offering little insight on this so-so track.<br /><br />The fourth DVD features an audio commentary on "Hearts and Minds" by executive producer Carlton Cuse, supervising producer Javier Grillo-Marxuach and actors Maggie Grace and Ian Sommerhalder. The two producers dominate the track as they talk about their intentions with the actors offering their occasional two cents.<br /><br />The bulk of the extras can be found on the seventh DVD. "The Genesis of Lost" is a good look at how the show's story came together. The network had a script but it was awful. At the time, Abrams was the network's go-to guy and he had already been toying with an idea of a plane crashing on a deserted island.<br /><br />"Designing a Disaster" takes a look at how they put together the chaotic crash site in the "Pilot" episode. The creators had no script and very little time but the production crew was able to find the right plane, take it apart, ship it and put it back together (sort of).<br /><br />"Before They Were Lost" examines how the cast came together in only three weeks. The actors talk about how they got the gig with footage from their audition tapes.<br /><br />"Welcome to Oahu: The Making of The Pilot" takes us through the first day of filming to completion. Cast and crew recount the sometimes harsh weather conditions they had to shoot in but it did help them bond as a team.<br /><br />"The Art of Matthew Fox" is a collection of photographs the actor took while shooting the "Pilot." He talks about them as they flash on the screen in this nice extra.<br /><br />"Lost@Comicon" is a brief clip of some of the cast and crew at that year's San Diego Comicon and their impressions of the event.<br /><br />"Lost: On Location" is a collection of behind-the-scenes featurettes that give insight into how certain sequences in select episodes were achieved, like the least-threatening wild boars, the humanizing of Sawyer, the revelation of Kate as a fugitive bank robber and a look at the climatic season finale.<br /><br />"Onset with Jimmy Kimmel" features the late night talk show host visiting the cast on location in Hawaii in this whimsical extra. Kimmel asks Monaghan to compose a (lame) theme song for the show and goofs around with everyone.<br /><br />"Backstage with Driveshaft" takes a look at Charlie and his fictitious band, which thinks of themselves as the next Oasis but is probably only a one-hit wonder.<br /><br />There are two flashbacks from the season finale with Claire and Sayid.<br /><br />Also included are 13 deleted scenes that feature mostly minor exchanges between characters, like a nice bit where Charlie bums a cigarette off of Sawyer, that are interesting but not essential and were probably cut because of time.<br /><br />"Bloopers from the Set" is an amusing montage of blown lines and funny pratfalls on this very physically demanding show.<br /><br />Finally, there is a Q&A session "Live from the Museum of Television and Radio." The select cast and crew joke with each other in this entertaining if not frivolous extra. Although, Abrams does reveal that originally Jack was supposed to die in the "Pilot" episode.</p></body></html>

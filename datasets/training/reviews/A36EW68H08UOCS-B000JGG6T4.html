<meta name="summary" content=""The Sound of Music" crossed with "Death Wish""></head><body><p>In addition to the above illogical mixture, the style and cinematography of Man on Fire is like "Traffic" or "21 Grams".<br /><br />Denzel Washington is one of our finest actors, and his performance here does nothing to tarnish his reputation.  Dakota Fanning is a cute kid who has no difficulty delivering precocious lines as a child actor.  In movie after movie in her brief career she has played essentially the same role: the little blonde girl who is smarter than the average little blonde girl.  In "Man on Fire" the aspect that works most effectively is the mentor/protege relationship between Denzel and young Miss Fanning as Pita.<br /><br />Like the Sound of Music this film features a child who is all but neglected by her powerful father.  Someone is hired to be with the child - (now that I think about it, this movie shares that quality with another of Miss Fanning's recent features, Uptown Girls, doesn't it?) But rather than hiring Julie Andrews, a spirited singing Nun, Pita's parents need a bodyguard and hire Denzel's Creasy, a burned-out alcoholic ex-special forces killer.<br /><br />You don't know exactly what Creasy did in his previous life, but you know it haunts him.  Early in the film he is reunited with his old service buddy, Rayburn, played by Christopher Walken.<br /><br />"Do you think God will forgive us for the things we've done?" he asks.<br /><br />"No", says Rayburn.<br /><br />"Me either", says Creasy succinctly.<br /><br />Creasy is initially all business with young Pita.  "I was hired to be your bodyguard, not your friend", he tells her when she tries to chat him up on the way to school.  But they form a believable bond and mutual respect over several weeks and some of the better scenes of the film are of Creasy acting as Pita's swimming coach.<br /><br />Then Pita is kidnapped in a scene that leaves Creasy with a couple of bullet wounds through his chest.  Creasy takes a bullet through the chest better than most people, though, and soon after he is striding through Mexico with a killer bravado that outdoes Charles Bronson in "Death Wish".  There is even a scene where Walken's character persuades the Mexican authorities to let Creasy go after the bad guys that reminded me of a very similar one in Death Wish.  "He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals," says Rayburn.  I wasn't expecting to suddenly find myself in a vigilante movie - and you, the prospective viewer, have to decide for yourself whether or not you'd enjoy such a thing.  Do you LIKE the idea of a well-armed civilian wading into the bad guys and blowing them away.... or do you prefer "traditional" justice, with cops and trials?<br /><br />If the story had partnered Creasy with the authorities in any kind of believable fashion I would have probably given a 4-star rating.  For the creative vigilante act I can only give 3 stars.</p></body></html>

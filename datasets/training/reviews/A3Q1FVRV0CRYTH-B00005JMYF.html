The premise has Vaughn facing eviction from his local run-down gym 'Average Joes' if he can't come up with $50,000.  Across the street is 'Average Joes' nightmare 'Globo-Gym' run by the hilarious Ben Stiller.  Vaughn and his team of losers including a nerd, a pirate, and man who seems to have down syndrum and a teen with girl issues, not to mention the girl the banks sent to repo his place of business (Taylor), deside to enter a dodgeball championship in order to win the money, which brings them to a final showdown with 'Globo-Gym'.  They enlist the help of Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn), a master of the dodgeball.  Rip is hilarious is every scene, with one liners like the one I used for my title that will keep you laughing harder and harder.  From start to finish this is one film that will keep you rolling...it's freaking hilarious.  Ben Stiller proves he is box-office gold and comedic genius!</p></body></html>

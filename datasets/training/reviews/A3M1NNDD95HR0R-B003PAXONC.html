<meta name="summary" content="Worth Watching If You Like The Concept"></head><body><p>I am a big Will Smith fan, and a sci-fi fan, and I like exploring the concept of being the last man on Earth, so I just had to see this movie.<br /><br />Will Smith does a superb job with the material he is given.  It rings true every step of the way.  I will not go into exactly what happens every moment of the movie, and there will be no spoilers here.  Instead, ask yourself if you would like to bond with Robert Neville, the character Mr. Smith plays, and go along on his dedicated journey to save lives, maintain sanity, and survive while avoiding imminent danger.  Also ask yourself if you would like a good cry.  This movie has a few tearjerking moments, and if you have any heart at all you will probably shed at least one tear.  This movie may not be perfect, but if you like the idea of Will Smith in this role you should see it at least once.</p></body></html>

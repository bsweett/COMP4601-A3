Even so, Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (2003), directed by Jonathan Mastow (U-571, Breakdown), is very worthy addition to this science fiction saga.  The hard hitting sequel, concentrates on spectacular straight ahead action, while advancing the Terminator story to the infamous `judgment day'.<br /><br />Terminator 3 incorporates many of same basic elements from the previous films, particularly T2.  In his last action role before becoming the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger returns again as a different model of the Terminator, once again sent back into the past, tasked with protecting John Connor (Nick Stahl).  A killer T-X Terminator, played by the striking Kristanna Loken, is sent back in time, with a list of humans to be terminated.  As in T2, the T-X is an upgraded version of terminator, constructed of liquid metal, that can change its physical form to mimic anyone it comes in contact with.  In addition, the T-X can control other machines.<br /><br />Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), who is John Connor's future wife, is also on the T-X's hit list.  Circumstances bring all the major players together, at Brewster's veterinary clinic, where the Terminator and the T-X have their first encounter, starting a thrilling and relentless chase, that lasts for the remainder of the film.  Special effects are a major component, and with people like Stan Winston involved, they are generally spectacular, and executed at an extremely high level.<br /><br />The story may be a familiar one, but the effectiveness of the tale is enhanced by some strong performances.  Some might argue that playing the Terminator may not require great acting skills, but few can match Arnold Schwarzenegger's huge screen presence, in this physically demanding role.  Borrowing from Robert Patrick's performance in T2, the striking Kristanna Loken plays a heartless killing machine with a feminine form.  She also has very few lines, as like Schwarzenegger, her role depends heavily on her athletic skills and physical presence.  It is quite an impressive performance, as clad in a dark red leather suit, and looking like a young Anne Francis, Loken is quite convincing as Arnold's physical equal.<br /><br />Last minute hire Claire Danes, handles her role well, as a character that goes through major transformations, and suffers the loss of loved ones.  Now in his 20's, John Connor is far from a world saving hero.  Nick Stahl is an interesting choice for this intriguing character, who does not seem very capable of fulfilling his destiny.<br /><br />Working largely from a very successful template, and featuring outstanding special effects, director Jonathan Mostow does a very competent job of executing a script that features a nice blend of familiar story elements, and some new twists.  Things are a bit rushed at the end, and the conclusion is somewhat anticlimactic, and uncertain, with the future in the hands of a somewhat shaky John Connor.  An exciting and violently fun adventure, Terminator 3 is a solid addition to any action film fan's collection.</p></body></html>

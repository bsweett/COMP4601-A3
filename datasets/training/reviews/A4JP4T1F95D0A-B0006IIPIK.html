Done almost entirely with blue screen, the actors really had their job cut out for them imagining all of the crazy things going on around them.  If you have ever seen the old seriels of Flash Gordon, this is very much the style of the movie.  Set in 1939, with strange future gadgets that seem a little silly now.  Sort of like when you watch the old Star Trek series with the ship being operated by a lot of knobs and dials when we know now that it won't be that way whenever we acheive that ability.  While Sky Captain is ambitious, it just falls flat for me and didn't rouse me into really caring for the characters and story.  This one is worth renting once to see the beautiful effects.  I would wait to purchase until after you have given it a watch.</p></body></html>

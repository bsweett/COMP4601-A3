<meta name="summary" content="Catch This Film If You Can"></head><body><p>This is another solid base hit in the storied career of director Steven Spielberg.  The title implies a bouncy cat and mouse thriller, which to some degree, it is.  But it is just as much a character study of a forger/con artist and his pursuer, a dogged treasury agent.  There is a somber tone to the film that suggests that the con artist, Frank Abignale Jr., is not so content with the choices he has made despite the apparent riches of his profession.  In contrast, the agent, Carl Hanratty, is equally lonely as a result of a recent divorce, which is probably why he plunges himself so wholeheartedly in his work.  As Frank Jr., this may be the best work that Leonardo DiCaprio has ever done.  As Agent Hanratty, Tom Hanks imbues the character with steely determination and dignity where the character could just as well have been portrayed as a bumbler.  Christopher Walken also contributes a superlative performance as Frank Sr., a ne'erdowell who Frank Jr. holds up on a pedestal.  Where the film falls a little short is as to why Frank Jr. chooses the life that he does.</p></body></html>

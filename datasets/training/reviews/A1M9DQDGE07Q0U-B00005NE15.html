<meta name="summary" content="A Foggy Ghost Story Gets Its Due"></head><body><p>John Carpenter's "The Fog" retains something of its original unsettling atmosphere for me even after twenty years.  There's just something creepy about the film and the natural phenomenon that slinks into Antonio Bay on the eve of its 100 year anniversary, to terrorize citizens with the ghosts of evil deeds past.<br />Jamie Lee Curtis is in the film but she isn't really the star in the sense that she was in Carpenter's "Halloween".  Spoiler - this film doesn't match "Halloween" in terror value so if you've never seen it and think you'll be scared stupid, think again.  Still, "The Fog" remains an unsettling treck into the night where ghosts roam the earth in search of treasure and revenge.  The scene with Mrs. Cobrits and the little boy (if you've seen the film before you know exactly what I'm talking about) still gives me sweaty palms.<br />MGM DVD has remastered the film in 5.1.  Although the anamorphic transfer is a marked improvement over previous issues on laserdisc and VHS there are still a few cases where visual information gets lost in the darkest scenes.  Also, film grain is obtrusive in several scenes.  Color fidelity is dated but nicely rendered.  At its best "The Fog" exhibits sharp images with good definition and color clarity.  At its worst, there's a momentary loss of fine detail and shadow and contrast delineation.  Also includes a documentary and featurette and theatrical trailer.  Overall, great job and well worth the money.  Just make sure you lock your doors and windows before you watch it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Be Cool, Because You Need To Be After Watching This Flat Interpretation of Elmore Leonard"></head><body><p>You get John Travolta and Uma Thurman.  You get a bunch of solid supports like Vince Vaughn, Cedric the Entertainer, Andre Benjamin, Harvey Keitel, James Woods, The Rock, Robert Pastorelli, Christina Milian, and Danny DeVito.  You get amusing cameos by Steven Tyler, Sergio Mendes, and many others.  Plus you get the original book of Elmore Leonard.  And then you get just OK 'Be Cool' unexceptional comedy drama.  In short, you don't have anotherr 'Get Shorty'; you only get short-changed.<br /><br />Chili Palmer who was seen in 'Get Shorty' comes back, and in this sequel he wants to move into the music industy.  But as you know, finding and promoting talented artists could be a tough job.  Even if you find one, the job could be killing you when your record company is in heavy debt, and some gangsters are after you.  But Chilie would be always cool, no matter what happen.  He could also get gorgeous Edie played by Uma Thurman -- cue to them on the dancing floor ala 'Pulp Fiction' -- and see a basketball game with Steven Tylor, one of the many, many cameos.<br /><br />In Elmore Leonard characters are everything, not the story, so I can forgive the complicated plot of the film.  I admit some characters are interesting, especially The Rock's Elliot, a thug who wants to be a movie star.  Stragely, the supports like Vince Vaughn and Andre Benjamin are more impressive than the two leading stars.<br /><br />[OFFBEAT? NO JUST FLAT] There is a fine line between being off-beat and flat, and if 'Get Shorty' belongs to the former, 'Be Cool' is described as the other.  In spite of some funny moments, like The Rock parodying his public image, director F Gary Gray overdoes it.  See how Elliot raises his eyebrow twice, while once is enough.  See a Russian mafioso's wig blown away twice, not once.  See Sin La Salle, the gangster played by Cedric the Entertainer acts before his lovely daughter as a good father ... twice.  No wonder the film runs 120 minutes.<br /><br />But actually, only one example would suffice to prove that 'Be Cool' needs Tarantino's skills.  There is a scene in which Travolta and Thurman dance together.  When they are in the same frame, everyone expects that, and yes, that happens.  And though the tension is not as high as the now classic Jack Rabbit Slim scene, the chemstry is there.  Sadly, however, the director ruins it with cut, cut, and cut, giving emphasis to God knows what.  That's when I missed the hand of Tarantino, who knows what he is doing, and knows what is going on.</p></body></html>

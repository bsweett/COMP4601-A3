He has such charisma and intensity that when he's onscreen, I find that plotholes don't bother me nearly as much...and this is certainly his best performance as Wolverine, yet.<br /><br />If anything, the film is guilty of trying to accomplish too much; trying to answer all of the questions raised in the first three films nearly guarantees that some depth will have to be sacrificed (and the filmmakers were well aware that this could well be the last film of the franchise, and wanted to tie up loose ends). But what emerges isn't just a resolution, but a new chapter, as well, with new characters (Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool and Taylor Kitsch as Gambit are standouts), a love interest you actually cared about (Lynn Collins), and a terrific love/hate relationship between Logan and his brother, Victor/Sabertooth (Liev Schreiber). I won't deny, though, it was fun seeing Patrick Stewart, again, briefly reprising his role as Professor Xavier (and looking more youthful, thanks to CGI).<br /><br />From a boyhood discovering his 'gifts' in the Canadian Rockies of the 1840s, to an explosive 1970s climax at Three-Mile Island (ah, the real reason for the near melt-down!), the Wolverine saga certainly deserves more than a one-film 'wrap', but it is fun!<br /><br />Two Special Features are worth your attention, as well; a conversation between 'Wolverine' creater Len Wein and 'X-Men' creator Stan Lee is light-hearted and entertaining, with both giving sincere credit to Jack Kirby and Chris Clarement's involvement; and the 'Making Of' featurette is an often funny look of Jackman's total commitment to an exercise/diet regimen to be as 'bulked' as possible as Wolverine. He ends the piece with the hope that fans like the latest entry enough that he can play the role again, as he loves the character.<br /><br />I really hope he gets his wish!</p></body></html>

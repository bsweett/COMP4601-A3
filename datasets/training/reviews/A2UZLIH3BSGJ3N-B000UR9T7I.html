<meta name="summary" content="Spiderman turned douche bag"></head><body><p>Well, the Spiderman franchise continues with the third (and hopefully last) installment. I wasn't terribly impressed with Spiderman 3, even less than the second film. Much of the same action takes place, far too much CGI for my eyes to digest. The plot continues as Peter Parker gets more comfortable being Spiderman and is a little less awkward and clumsy as before (well, sort of).He and Marry Jane are due to be married, and his best friend Harry turned "Green Goblin" is out to destroy Spiderman for the death of his father, the original Green Goblin.<br /><br />  Two new characters are introduced, Sandman and Venom (I'll get to those in a bit). A mysterious asteroid plummets and hits smack dab in the middle of New York, and wouldn't ya know it? Within walking distance of Peter and Marry Jane (how convenient).A weird, alien parasite creeps from the asteroid and hitches a ride on Peter's mope head. We also learn of The Sandman who is supposedly the real murderer of Peter Parker's Uncle. The sandman wasn't always the Sandman, as we get to see his creation due to his escape from jail and on the run from police to his unfortunate timing and "science" mishap.<br /><br />  Pete begins undergoing strange behaviors as the mysterious, black, alien substance finds its way onto his outfit. Parker then seems to pretty much act like a jerk to everyone and pushes Marry Jane further and further away. Pete discovers the origin of not only his behavior, but his bad luck as well and literally tears it off of himself; there under "convenience" his next nemesis is born, "Venom" as the alien substance finds a new host...someone caught in the wake of Spiderman's own bad behavior and vows to destroy Spiderman. In the end, Peter makes good with his friend Harry and the two duke things out with Sandman and Venom. We find out that Peter's Uncle's death was an accident, and well...Harry sacrifices himself for his buddy and Venom is obliterated from existence.<br /><br />  There are far too many subplots and things going on in the third installment, not that you can't follow it...but even in comic book terms...this would take many issues to develop instead of being summed up inside of 2 1/2 hours. The CGI was too much, although the action sequences would not have been possible without it. I didn't care much about Sandman, nor did I Venom or even Harry as the "New Green Goblin". The characters (as hard as Rami tried) were as one dimensional as the comic characters, actually...allot worse. I hope that Sam Rami, a director who I admire has Spiderman out of his system and moves onto bigger and better projects? I ultimately hope for a return and continuation of "The Evil Dead". Spiderman 3 is watchable, but only good for one viewing. I wouldn't rent it again, and certainly wouldn't recommend buying it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good superhero movie"></head><body><p>Iron Man is a good superhero movie, quite enjoyable. The acting is great, especially Robert Downey Jr. (obviously). The interactions between Tony Stark and Peppers made me chuckle, actually just Stark's attitude in general made me chuckle. The story, characters, and music were all good. Now, just to make it clear, I've never read an Iron Man comic before, don't know how closely it relates to the comics. But, this is a good movie that I recommend. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></body></html>

Unfortunately, like his contemporary Pol Pot, he also had little use for anyone who criticized him. So much so, in fact, that three hundred thousand of his critics ended up dead during his brief eight years in power. It was a weird time, it was. Not that our particular time period is any less weird, who'd have thought that the (fictional) memoirs of Amin's doctor would get made into a movie, and that Forest Whitaker would win a Best Actor Oscar for playing the demented dictator?<br /><br />I will admit to not yet having read Giles Foden's book, so I can't comment on the faithfulness of the adaptation, but I do know that the movie version turned out like gangbusters. Whitaker's Amin is a fascinating chap, though one has to wonder at the portrayal of the man as less a ruthless dictator than an idealist who eventually succumbs to paranoia. James McAvoy (The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe) plays Nicholas Garrigan, a doctor in the bush who, after a chance encounter, finds himself invited to be Amin's personal doctor, a situation he uses to escape an awkward relationship with his boss' wife (Gillian Anderson) at the village hospital. In fact, much of what we see of Garrigan defines his life in terms of running away from things; he's in Uganda in the first place because he couldn't stand the thought of going into general practice in his family's sleepy small Scotland town. Much of the non-Amin-related drama from the movie comes from Garrigan, who starts off as a devoted believer in Amin's regime, becoming disillusioned enough to find the willpower not to run away (until, of course, not running away is the difference between life and death).<br /><br />In every way that Garrigan comes off as mousy (or, as British agent Nigel Stone [Simon McBurney] calls him, "Amin's White Monkey"), Whitaker's portrayal of Idi Amin is boisterous. Amin comes off as larger than life, a guy whose main purpose in life is to have a good time. Give him a little power, it goes to his head, and suddenly the buzz-kills start getting murdered. But it's all good, because there's still money, power, women, and everything else that comes from being the president of a mid-sized African country. And, at the heart of it all, there is Nicholas Garrigan, who goes from being Amin's doctor to being his closest advisor, a man who doesn't know about most of what's going on and is torn about calling Amin to task for the rest and defending Amin's judgment.<br /><br />History has portrayed Idi Amin as one-dimensional, an insane dictator whose sole purpose was to kill his countrymen. The Last King of Scotland pushes the balance back the other way a bit, I think; while it never glosses over the fact that Amin was, in fact, an insane dictator, it makes sure we understand that that may not have always been the case, and turns Amin into a complex, three-dimensional character who is endlessly fascinating. This is a good movie, this is. Worth your time. *** ?</p></body></html>

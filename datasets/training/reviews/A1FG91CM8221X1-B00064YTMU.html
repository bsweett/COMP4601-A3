<meta name="summary" content="A wonderfully jittery paranoid thriller."></head><body><p>Michael Mann's "Collateral" is as an intense, edge-of-your-seat action thriller as you'll find this summer, thanks to Mann's breathless yet elegant directorial style and the cat-and-mouse chemistry between stars Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Stuart Beattie's screenplay turns the screws on Max Durocher (Foxx), an amiable L.A. cabbie who suddenly finds his cab commandeered by a sociopathic hit man named Vincent (Cruise). Villainy becomes Cruise: he is gleefully charismatic in a role that is as much as possible devoid of redeeming human qualities. And Foxx really makes you feel for Max, a nice guy coasting through life who now must call on long-unused reserves of resourcefulness and cunning, simply to live through the night. There also are an unflappable L.A. cop on Vincent's trail, played by the usually very flappable Mark Ruffalo; a sexy district attorney played by Jada Pinkett Smith; a malevolent drug kingpin played by Javier Bardem; and Max's disapproving mom, played by Irma P. Hall in the movie's sharpest comic relief. The photography by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron makes a glittering, sprawling deathtrap of Los Angeles, adding immeasurably to the film's slick malevolence.</p></body></html>

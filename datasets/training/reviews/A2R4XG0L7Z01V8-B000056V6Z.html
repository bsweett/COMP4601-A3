But the film seemed to fall flat on its face a lot of the time, and inbetween the high octane action stuff, it was very dull.<p>If you're thinking there are similarities between this and The Matrix, you'd be right. It's the same guy who choreographed The Matrix fight scenes, who did this as well. I also saw similarities between this & Mission Impossible. There is probably a lot more similarities, but there's always one film 'borrowing' off another these days - I'm just beginning to notice it more and more.<p>OK, so this film is showing that girls can kick some butt when they want to, and can be "independant women" and not have to rely on guys to do their dirty work for them. So how come Cameron Diaz's character goes all gooey, whenever that guy she met at the bar phones?! That's being independant alright.<p>Three minutes into the film, I spotted a major flaw. Maybe it was just me, but I thought if you opened the doors on a plane and jumped out (which of course, everyone has done at least once), everyone else on the plane got sucked out after you? I'm basing this after seeing Final Destination too many times.<p>Who's your favourite Angel? Personally I couldn't stand Cameron Diaz or Lucy Liu. Cameron is normally so great in a lot of the roles I've seen her in, but in this, she played up the dizzy blonde act a little too much. Drew Barrymore is the greatest Angel, and had the pizzazz to keep the film going, and keep the viewer watching. And she seemed the least fake out of the three.<p>I'm hoping the second film will be better. This movie was fun to watch, don't get me wrong, just could have been better. There are a lot of gratuitous shots of the girls, mainly for the guys, but it gets a bit tiresome after a while for the girls watching! There's only so many times you can bitch about someone with Drew Barrymore's assets not having any support!</p></body></html>

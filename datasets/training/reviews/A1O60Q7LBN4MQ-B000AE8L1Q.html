<meta name="summary" content="Good relationship movie"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed this movie if only for Joan Allen's portrayal of a bitter blooming-alcoholic living in the 'burbs with 4 beautiful daughters around 15 to 21. Kevin plays a retired baseball player now DJ (for WRIF-FM, the station I listened to often in Detroit when I was in my late teens and early '20s). He too drinks way too much. They find solace in each other.<br /><br />I loved watching Joan Allen and the movie does have a good script. I liked all the major characters in it except one. All but the detestable middle age guy. He only goes out with young women is made to be the guy you love to hate.<br /><br />I think most women over 40 will like this movie. I highly recommend it to them and anyone who enjoys films about relationships.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Will Has A Few Thrills While Making Left-Hand Turns"></head><body><p>With the final action, a match-race, which is seemingly a (drawn-out) parody of the ending to the classic early-1970s roller derby movie, Kansas City Bomber, Will Ferrell brings a funny romp through NASCAR to a frustrating checkered-flag.<br /><br />The plot surrounds Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) and his rags-to-riches-rags-to-riches saga on the NASCAR circuit. This is over-the-top farce on the roots of stock-car racing, the commercialization of the sport and fandom.<br /><br />But what plagues the script is many of the scenes are quick comedic bits that are wedged into spots, which stalls the story, instead of providing a needed boost. Ultimately, Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, is not on the superspeedway of comedic releases, but certainly holds its position on a short track.</p></body></html>

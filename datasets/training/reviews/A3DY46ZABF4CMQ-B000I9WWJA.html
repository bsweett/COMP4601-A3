<meta name="summary" content="Inside Man...is right on target!"></head><body><p>Inside Man is a new film by acclaimed director Spike Lee (Do The Right Thing), and stars Denzel Washington (Training Day), Clive Owen (Sin City), Christopher Plummer (Syriana), and Jodie Foster (Flightplan). Inside Man would be the latest collaboration between Lee and Washington, after such films as 1992's Malcolm X, and 1998's He Got Game.<br /><br />Spike Lee surprises audiences this time around with a suspenseful heist thriller, a territory that he hadn't experimented with up until Inside Man.<br /><br />Clive Owen plays bank robber Dalton, who leads a gang into a New York City bank one day, forces the hostages to wear the same clothes they are wearing including black hoodies and white masks. Washington plays troubled detective Keith Frazier, who is trying to negotiate with Dalton to let hostages go and find out what he wants. In the meantime, bank owner Arthur Case, played by Plummer, is afraid the robbers might uncover a secret document in one of the safe boxes in the bank, so he assigns a tough-as-nails problem solver named Madeline White, played by Foster, to try to strike a deal with the robbers. What Frazier is about to uncover are deep secrets and a very unexpected surprise as the events unfold.<br /><br />Despite some flaws and a few vague characters, I enjoyed Inside Man. Denzel Washington, as usual, delivers a fine performance, and Spike Lee's direction is right on target.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B</p></body></html>

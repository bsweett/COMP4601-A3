<meta name="summary" content="A movie that keeps you in suspense"></head><body><p>I am not a big Al Pacino or Robert De Niro fan but both play really good roles in this movie, Heat.  Very suspenseful with lots of action and keeps your attention well from beginning to the end.  There is a lot of violence as well and would not call it a family movie.  Even though it is 15 years old, it might still be one of the best combined action/suspense movies I have seen.  If you like mystery/crime films with a ton of action, then be sure to watch it if you have not already.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></body></html>

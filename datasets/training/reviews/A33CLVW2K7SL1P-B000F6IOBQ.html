I say that because this, like its predecessor, took a cool concept and instead of fully exploring it made a Monster Movie meets The Wild West.<br /><br />My main complaint (I have many more) is that there are two races, two races that are as interwoven into Western mythical culture as any - vampires and werewolves - and these two races evoke enormous emotion in any who follow them, fan and critic alike. They have boundless strengths and powers. They're even *mated* in this film, a sum that is greater than its parts (granted they're not very well defined). Am I to understand that the very best these guys could do in a Vampire vs. Werewolf film where they've *mated* is to include extremely (over)long shots of action that are staccatoed by automatic handguns and rifles? That when advanced weaponry is introduced (UV bullets, and bullets that contain silver oxide?!), that the best we get are regular bullets? If I'm Selene (Beckinsale), I'm loading up on BOTH of these bullets, not just the useless lead ones.<br /><br />We're introduced to a much deeper mythology than we were introduced to in the first film. That's a wonderful thing - except they don't go anywhere with it other than to its inevitable conclusion. And in the end, it fails. After a very long battle between the good guys and the bad guys, with more bullets than magic or fists and claws and fangs, there is a resolution. It's a resolution that, when you examine the sum of its parts, doesn't add up. The mythology that I referred to earlier doesn't add up, or hold up, either.<br /><br />I can say this: everything that went into making the film LOOK good paid off. It was gorgeous. Unfortunately, this was only skin deep - and when the sun rose at the end of the film, one had to wonder how deeply it would itch.</p></body></html>

Didn't know quite what to expect, but enjoyed it for what it was: a violent, goofy, over-the-top exercise in comic-book mayhem.  I guess with a name like "Kick-Ass" you'd have to expect violence, and this movie has it. Lots of it. But it also offers some sly social commentary and moments of dark humor. "Kick-Ass" is not for everyone, but if you don't mind swearing (lots!) and violence, then you'll probably get a kick out of "Kick-Ass."  Overall, I give this a low 4 stars.</p></body></html>

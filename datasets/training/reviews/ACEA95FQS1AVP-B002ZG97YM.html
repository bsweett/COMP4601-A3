<meta name="summary" content="A great ending saved it"></head><body><p>I've been recommended this film many times since it was released, and it has tons of glowing reviews, so I expected to love it.  I'm obviously in the minority, but I do not think this even comes close to rivaling a Pixar film for quality.  My husband and my mom watched this with me (no kids).  We have enjoyed many Pixar films, but all agreed this was disappointing.  Yes, this is an excellent film for kids, but not for adults.  I did love that the dragons had cat-like characteristics.  It was an interesting take on them that brought some humor to the story.  Plus, the graphics were top notch.  Visually, the movie is great.  However, it is the story that falls short.<br /><br />This felt like a 30 minute film had been stretched to an hour and a half.  The entire first hour was very slow, even boring at times.  It's almost 45 minutes in before Hiccup even starts training the dragon.  And the story has a "been there, done that" feel.  Scrawny kid that no one respects, bullied by his peers, uses intelligence to save the day.  A great lesson sure, but lacking originality.  Plus, none of the characters stand out besides Hiccup.  After watching the film, I cannot recall the name of any other character besides him and Toothless!  What saved the film for me, and the reason I gave it 3 stars, is that the last 20-25 minutes were fantastic.  It was a very exciting, action-packed happily-ever-after conclusion. I would watch that part again.  Overall I am glad I did not pay theatre prices to see this.  I understand that a sequel has already been green-lit. I might give it a try if it has a more original storyline.  Recommended for families.</p></body></html>

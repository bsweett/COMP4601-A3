<meta name="summary" content="Big Fish is big on imagination"></head><body><p>I saw Big Fish while in limited release in New York City. What a sweet little picture. Too nice infact, it'll be sure to be ignored. You will either love it or hate it because it's just plain sincere and straight forward. I found albert finney to be as charismatic as ever. Ewan McGregor, was a bit type cast, but he's good at playing the perfect guy. It's the most un-tim burton, tim burton has ever been. Which adds to the movies unique look and feel. He allows his imagination to grace the screen but unlike things like Kill Bill it never distracts from the over all experience. Tim Burton said he made this movie as therapy for losing his parents recently. And that what this movie feels like, good medicine. I recently had a scare with my mom going to the hospital, and this movie really made me feel better.<p>The stories, this is the meat of the movie. They are fantastic. They are funny. I believe they really happened. They are hauntingly surreal and are as intriguing to watch as they must have been to hear. This is where the movie takes off and sweeps you off your feet. I won't ruin  stories themselves but they were a complete delight to behold. So much so, that the scenes in between them tend to drag on until the next tall tale comes along.<p>My criticism are few but if I had to nit pick I would say that the cynical son is almost TOO cynical, and it's really stupid as to WHY he doesn't talk to his father anymore. But when he starts to soften up, that falls to the way side. The movie starts off a little strange, the editing could have been tighter and basically when we dont see albert finney or his younger self things definetly slow down on screen. It has its flaws.<p>And last but not least, the Pearl Jam song in the credits...PERFECT. I smell a best song oscar for Eddie Vedder and crew.<p>Good Job Tim. Sweet movie. Don't get so hyped about it folks. It's not Ed Wood and it's not anything else. It's a bit over sweet, so it depends on what kind of mood your in. I for one got hooked and reeled in by the very big heart of this very big fish.</p></body></html>

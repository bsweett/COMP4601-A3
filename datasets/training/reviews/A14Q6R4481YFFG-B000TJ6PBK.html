<meta name="summary" content="The Game goes supernatural"></head><body><p>In many ways 1408 reminds me of 1997's "The Game," the Michael Douglas psychological thriller.  In both cases, the movies' writers try to cram a maximum number of head fakes into as short amount of time as possible. The two films also put forth the very implausible idea that if you manipulate a person's mind enough, and mentally break him, that somehow that's going to heal him, or at least begin the process of healing.  Count me as skeptical on that one.<br /><br />The two movies do differ on the source of their protagonists' psychological and physical torture.  While The Game tries to make a non-supernatural case for psychotic manipulation, 1408 just presents the supernatural as fact.  In 1408, causes and motives for the supernatural events are irrelevant, with the minor implication, as presented by Samuel L. Jackson in a refrigerator of all places, that the people who stay in the inhospitable room are somehow guilty of bringing their doom upon themselves.<br /><br />The DVD provides alternative endings to the movie release.  They're just as good in their own ways as the theatrical ending, which has the more palatable theme of restoration, rather than martyrdom.  Choose whichever ending suits your predilections.</p></body></html>

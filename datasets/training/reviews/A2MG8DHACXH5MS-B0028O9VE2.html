To sum it up ... it's all about choices and how when children are involved you can't do what you want without harming their lives for better and worse.<br /><br />When Flor and her daughter enter the lives of the Claskys they are immersed in three generations of mother-daughter conflicts with their dad in the middle of it. Flor takes a liking to the family with the exception of Deborah (Mrs. Clasky). Things get even more complicated when Flor and Christina must move in with the family for the summer. In the end, this is one love triangle without a happy ending for anyone involved.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Scotts finest hour...."></head><body><p>'I would be proud to lead you wonderful guys into battle....anytime....anywhere'.  And with that line....Patton is personified.  The commandant of the rampaging 3rd army is a fascinating character study....a general who was fascinated by battles past and had no political ambition after the war.  He simply wanted to lead an army to glorious victory...which he did brilliantly.  George C Scott portrays the gregarious Patton and plays it to perfection.  The voice, uniform, swagger,  its all there.  He truly becomes Patton and won a well deserved Academy Award for best Actor.<br /><br />  Not to be missed,  its truly one of the greats.</p></body></html>

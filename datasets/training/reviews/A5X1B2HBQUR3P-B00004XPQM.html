<meta name="summary" content="You can't stop death's design"></head><body><p>The basic theme of the movie of the whole final destination franchise remains the same. The concept that death is an unstoppable force and inevitable law of nature, is well known to us but the final destination franchise brought to us in a big hollywood motion picture environment, the concept that if the plan of death is altered then death corrects itself by creating random and freakish circumstances to get those persons anyway who were doomed in the first place. All three final destination films play on the theme that if you mess with the plan of death then a very gruesome death is anyway inevitably in store for you. When it comes to final destination, it is more useful to compare all three movies in the franchise. In 2, the director is not the same as 1 and 3. But 2 is pretty dramatic of all the 3 movies but it lacks a strong and convincing ending. In all three films the plot idea is that there is a first act pivotal piece scene, where a permonition by a lead character saves the lives of people who were to meet certain death. Now these people who escaped death will now die in the exact order in which they would have died in the first place if Death's initial plan had not be altered. In 1 this pivotal scene was an airplane explosion, in  2 it is an amazing and very convincingly shot freeway pile up and in 3 it is a very realistic looking rollercoaster mishap. For the initial first act, of all three films I feel the freeway pileup in 2 was the most intense and convincing start out of all three films in the franchise. From a standpoint of gore, I would say number 3 had the most realistic looking bloodfest. From a standpoint of originality, 1 was the freshest being the first in the series. Final destination 2 had the basic weakness in its ending in trying to make the main characters survive, they came up with this unbelievable idea that new life cancels out the need for death to take life. This plot idea is inserted to give a good ending to 2. But the strongest movie of the franchise in terms of the original concept of final destination and which works is movie 3 because its gives the message we got in 1 that you cannot escape death. 3 has a number of set piece scene sequences. The roller coaster mishap, a festival fireworks display gone wrong and a final amazing metro train crash. In summing it up Movie 3 is better than movie 2 is better than movie 1. After 1, we all know the franchise plot, we know they will all die one by one, but the fun in the series is that given a set of props on the scene, we are kept guessing which freaky set of circumstance and permutations is going to mutate itself into creating a noose for one of our characters.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tackling Teen Pregnancy With Humor And Care"></head><body><p>Writer Diablo Cody has managed to take a very serious topic, teen pregnancy, and successfully blend it with humor, innocence and a bit of fear to make a wonderful film:  "Juno."<br /><br />Some believe that this film champions the ideals of the pro-choice crowd.  Others see it as a movie that highlights the positive aspects of choosing life instead of abortion.  What I see is a film about a young girl who is attempting to rationalize the severity of her situation with a mind that is still in its formative years.<br /><br />Ellen Page stars as Juno McGuff, a teen who has just found out that she is pregnant for her good friend, Bleeker (Michael Cera).  On a whim (at least as Juno sees it), the pair have sex and now they have to deal with its consequences.  Instead of that happening, though, Juno pretty much keeps Bleeker in the dark about the entire situation.  He approaches the situation with confusion and innocence.  She tries to work through it with sarcasm and wit.<br /><br />Eventually, Juno finds an adoptive family for her child through the Penny Saver paper.  Enter Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), a couple looking for their first child after many failed attempts.  Vanessa is hungry to be a mother while Mark is a little hesitant about becoming a dad.<br /><br />Once the legalities of the adoption are set, the rest of the film follows Juno through the ups and downs of being a pregnant teen and how her relationships with others are affected.  She deals with being stared at by classmates and sneered at by school staff.  Her relationship with Bleeker takes a few detours.  She bonds with Mark through music and with Vanessa through motherhood.  She also strengthens the bond with her father and step mother.  A twist is thrown late in the film to add a little drama to the story, but it fits perfectly.<br /><br />What you have in the end is a film that deals with teen pregnancy with well-placed humor and just the right amount of tenderness.  The cast, for the most part, is brilliant.  J.K. Simmons as Juno's father does a brilliant job.  He perfectly evokes a father's disappointment, confusion, fear and eventual pride and joy for his daughter.  Allison Janney plays Juno's step mother.  She shows how much a person tries to make a connection with their step child by protecting Juno.  Page can be a bit over-the-top at times, but she does a solid enough job to never make me lose interest in her character.  Cera does an excellent job of showing the uncertainty in Bleeker.  His character develops wonderfully as the story goes along.  Bateman turns in an impressive performance as Mark, a man approaching middle-age and still hanging on to the past.  While Garner does a fine job as Vanessa, I felt at times that she was pushing the emotional envelope a bit too much.  Her character seems to have this picture perfect (and somewhat Utopian)idea of what it's like to be a mother, but she also shows emotions that I find would be more likely to be found in a woman who is actually pregnant.  Still, this is the only shortfall in the cast and is forgivable thanks to the overall strength of the rest of the cast and the film as a whole.<br /><br />I must point out that the music is pretty good, but a few of the songs rake the nerves.  If you like your music with a bit of a folk tinge to it or happen to be a regular listener of NPR, you'll probably love the soundtrack.  If your tastes require a bit more punch, you might be turned off by the film's music.<br /><br />There is a bit of strong language in the film, but nothing that your average child over the age of ten doesn't hear in the store every day.  The sexuality in the movie is dealt with briefly and with humorous teen confusion, and there is no nudity.  On a positive note, Juno's family has a strong bond, which is especially important in dealing with a teen pregnancy.  Her father and step mother give her strong support throughout the film.<br /><br />If you're looking for a light comedy/drama that deals with a very heavy subject, I highly recommend "Juno."  I initially thought that this film would be a bust considering the heavy hype it received during its theatrical release, but it has turned me into a believer.  "Juno" is an excellent film.</p></body></html>

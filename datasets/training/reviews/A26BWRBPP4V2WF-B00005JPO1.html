With Star Wars, George Lucas set the story an entire generation earlier.  With the Indiana Jones series, even the series is named after the star, and such a film would be virtually unthinkable without Harrison Ford.  I like Harrison Ford, but he's getting on in years, and there's nothing more pathetic than 60-year-old men trying to act like they are 30 years old.  So instead of changing the character (or the actor), George changed the story - the year is not 193x, it is 195x. The bad guys are not Nazis but Soviets.  The B-movie template the adventure is grafted onto is not the 1930s serials but science-fiction masking as cold-war paranoia.  And in this George Lucas was absolutely correct - this is the way Indiana Jones could be pulled off 20 years later.  Unfortunately, this great idea is not carried off successfully and the film just isn't as good as I would expect from an Indy film.<br /><br />Prof. Henry Jones Jr. is still teaching archaeology at a liberal arts university, and still moonlighting as a "collector of rare antiquities".  He is kidnapped by Soviet agents and forced into the very warehouse that houses the Ark of the Covenant.  The Soviets, however, are after the Crystal Skull - an artifact of great power (potentially, at least) and that generates an impossibly strong (by modern science's understanding) magnetic field.  Thus Indy is off with a few others in tow to find the origin of the crystal skull.<br /><br />There are many great parts about this film.  Some of the action sequences rival the best (many are non-CGI!) sequences from the previous films.  Marian Ravenwood returns, and she is just as spunky as ever (and, remarkably, looks to have aged far less than Indy).  There are flashes of humour - I especially liked the student asking Professor Jones a question in the middle of a chase scene through the University library.  Sure, it sounds cheesy and contrived when written in a text review, but all of Indiana Jones is designed that way, the fun is the new ways in which the same contrivances are presented.  And the addition of Shia Lebouef as a younger, brash sidekick is not as annoying as you'd think - in fact, I grew to quite like young Mutt.<br /><br />But, but, but.....  Ultimately, the film descends into a giant CGI-fest that wears out its welcome in the second half.  The snakes, bugs, and rats in Indys 1,2,and 3 are real critters, and therefore creepy - you know Willie is sticking her hand into an alcove of creepy crawlies, or that Marian has fallen into a pit of vipers.  In Indy 4 we get CGI ants that ooze homogeneous pink goo when squished and who apparently have a hive intellegence.  Worse yet, the climax of the film mostly consists of the main characters staring at a blue screen.  I was reminded of Richard Dreyfuss's famous comment to Spielberg about Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind - "Have you decided what we're staring at yet, Stephen?"  But worst of all, Indiana Jones is neutered by the end because of the introduction of Oxley, the expert on the Crystal Skulls.  All Indy can manage is to ask Oxley, again and again (and again!) "what do we do now?" "How did you get through here the last time?" "Where do we go next?" "How do we defeat this guardian/lock/trap?"  This is not the Indiana Jones who can read heirogliphics, knows the legends of the Thugee cult, and who can "fly? yes. Land? No!" but proceeds to fly the plane anyways.<br /><br />So I am all the more disappointed that such a promising premise degenerated by the end into mush.  I'm not sure wherein the problem lies - certainly it's not with Cate Blanchett, Karen Allen or Shia Lebouef.  It's not even with Harrison Ford (at least, not his acting).  They do the best they can.  No, ultimately, I guess the blame must be laid at one (or both) of Lucas and Speilberg for not being able to pull it off.  It's a shame, too, because I really wanted to like this film.  Finally, I can't get over the title.  Why "Kingdom" of the Crystal Skull?  Why not just "Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"?  Or "Indy and the search for El Dorado"? or "the City of Gold"?  Worst name ever.... except for "Attack of the Clones".<br /><br />This Blu-ray edition has some nice extras in it, mostly making-of stuff.  But, as with Lucas's other films, the making-of stuff has clearly been edited and presented in a form that makes it interesting and informative, rather than the haphazard extras most DVDs and Blu-rays include.</p></body></html>

For the record, I knew very little about the man and so had very few preconceptions.  What I saw made a deep impression in my mind and heart.<br /><br />Ray Robinson, aka Ray Charles the singer, songwriter and musician, was blind since the age of 7.  He had to deal not only with bigotry for his disability but for being black in Georgia before the civil rights movement.  Throughout his life many people (both black and white) would try to take advantage of the blind man, ripping him off financially or  hoarding his talent for their own gain. Ray had both the blessing and the curse of being a ladies' man, resulting in serial affairs while his wife stayed home and raised their family.  It surprised me to learn that he fought an addiction to heroin for well over a decade before finally beating it in the `60s.  Nevertheless, Ray carried all this baggage and more through the 40s and 50s as he made a name for himself playing piano in the Country, Jazz, etc. pop music circuits.  Eventually of course he rose to become one of the most recognized and beloved musical artists worldwide.<br /><br />The man that this film showed me was an incredible example of determination, charm and simple human spirit.  I have heard others say that Jamie Foxx's acting was so good that they were half-convinced he was channeling Ray Charles' ghost.  I'll take their word for it that it was an accurate performance, but regardless, it was also a great performance!  Down the line each of the supporting actors was perfectly convincing and real, but none more so than Foxx.  I will denounce the Academy if he isn't at least nominated for an Oscar.<br /><br />The least of Ray's imperfections was his physical blindness --yet he had a powerful gift and the ability to reach into the collective soul of a nation. Over his long career as a musician and songwriter, Ray Charles Robinson created and performed some of the most memorable music to audiences across the country.  Your color, age and creed doesn't matter; chances are, you've heard and loved at least one Ray Charles song in your lifetime.  We'll never have another like him.<br /><br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle.</p></body></html>

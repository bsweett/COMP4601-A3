I can't add much to it, but I'll try.<br /><br />I think this is an extremely well made remake of a  classic.  I've always been a big fan of Kurt Russell and think he's never given enough credit for his versatile acting skills.  He makes a good leader without being arrogrant or bossy.  In addition, Josh Lucas (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B8IA44">Stealth</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EXZFCQ">Glory Road</a>) makes a great reluctant hero.  Of course, Emmy Rossum of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKNL0">The Phantom of the Opera</a> fame is always a pleasure to watch along with Richard Dryfuss whom we all learned to love in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9G">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">Jaws</a> back in the '70's.  The acting is all very convincing as is most of the dialogue and sets.<br /><br />The special effects are not groundbreaking, but they are extraordinary and very believable.  They definitely have the "WOW!" factor even though we have seen these types of effects before (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXJD">The Perfect Storm</a>), only here they are better.<br /><br />This film is worth owning and stands much more on it's own rather than as a simple remake.  It's noteworthy that the two leaders played by Lucas and Russell work together rather than against each other as the two main characters (played by Hackman and Borgnine) did in the original film (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHSVNW">The Poseidon Adventure</a>).<br /><br />The "Special Features" are definitely worth viewing on the two-disc set "Special Edition" package.</p></body></html>

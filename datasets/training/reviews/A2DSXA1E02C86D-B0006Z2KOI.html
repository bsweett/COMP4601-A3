<meta name="summary" content="A revolutionary's incubator"></head><body><p>THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES has an Argentine medical student and his biochemist pal on a backpacking road trip. There'd be nothing remarkable about the story except that it's ostensibly true and the student eventually matured into Che Guevara, that revolutionary whose memory is revered by dissidents and the politically correct everywhere.<br /><br />Gael Garcia Bernal is Ernesto Guevara, who, with one year of med school remaining, is off with Alberto Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna) on a 12,000+ kilometer lark through Argentina, Chile, Peru and points north on the latter's decrepit motorcycle in search of adventure, self discovery, and babes. As the bike gives up it's ghost at about the film's midpoint, the title THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES may be misleading. But, you get the picture. In any case, whether they're walking or riding, Granado is the bon vivant, while Guevara is the serious, upper middle class, young man, whose conscience is troubled by the amount of social stratification and capitalist oppression of the masses that he observes along the way.  By the film's conclusion, Ernesto is beginning to evolve into the "Che" that ultimately entered history as Fidel Castro's lieutenant in the Cuban Revolution.<br /><br />The film is notable for the lush scenery and spectacular locations of South America, and which include the Incan ruins of Machu Picchu and a riverside leper colony, where the boys donate their volunteer services. Machu Picchu was real; I can't vouch for the authenticity of the leprosarium. (Indeed, I was impressed with the apparent authenticity of the lepers' afflictions. Were they actually people stricken with Mycobacterium leprae, or just actors with strategically applied body make-up?) The movie also has it's humorous moments, especially during the first half when our heroes stuttering progression across the landscape comprises a series of road mishaps on the motorcycle. Here, that's what constitutes male bonding.<br /><br />During the ending credits, Guevara's death is attributed to the evil Central Intelligence Agency, which had Che murdered when he sought to export The Glorious Revolution to the South American mainland. Oooh, there's the Machiavellian CIA, again! However, since Che's efforts helped make Cuba into a Third World armpit for these past five decades, perhaps the American taxpayer, since unable to buy his Havanas at the corner cigar shop, got his money's worth in the end.<br /><br />I would've liked THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES more without the political message that's been long since discredited. But, that's just me, an unreconstructed Cold War Neanderthal. As is, it's a good road story that reminds the viewer of the exuberance of youth and the adventures to be found if one has the stamina for it.</p></body></html>

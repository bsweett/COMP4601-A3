There is one Kubrick and no director working today is as talented as him and nor do any film directors work the way he did. Maybe a problem is that there is too much wanting to copy the master going on with some of these younger guys? (I read an interesting article in EW awhile back that went into that topic.) But anyway, look, this film is bold, highly original and credit is to be given to the director for having guts. But IMHO it just doesn't work. As for the look of the film, it felt....I don't know how to put it--I want to say "stuffy" and plastic. It felt like I was in a Christmas store in the mall or something. In anycase the effects didn't take my breath away. What the movie is about is obviously death and fear of death and how life is here, now. OK, message received. And I guess we're supposed to try to come to terms with the three Hugh Jackman/Rachel Weisz stories or at least be interested in how they relate and what it all means. It's so symbolic and stuff.</p></body></html>

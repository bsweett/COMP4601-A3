<meta name="summary" content="Visually impressive and incredibly trite"></head><body><p>The live action adaptation of Peter Chung's beloved anime series Aeon Flux is one of the most visually impressive sci-fi films to be released in the last year, and it's also one of the most incredibly trite and tedious as well.  Charlize Theron slips into skin tight leather as the acrobatic heroine/assassin on a mission to overthrow an oppressive regime, I think.  The story of the film takes a back seat to the visuals and to Theron who sleepwalks her way throughout the film's running time, but you'd hardly notice because she looks so damned good.  The action and special effects are nicely done, but the film's incoherent storyline, wasted cast (Frances McDormand and Johnny Lee Miller are wasted beyond belief), and otherwise surprisingly tepid direction from Girlfight director Karyn Kusama make Aeon Flux a film that's strictly for fans of modern, empty sci-fi; and even fans of the anime series that it hardly resembles may find it hard to enjoy.</p></body></html>

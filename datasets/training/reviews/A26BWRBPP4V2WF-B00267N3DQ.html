<meta name="summary" content="Good movie, FANTASTIC EXTRAS, Blu-ray technical issues very annoying"></head><body><p>It is probably pointless to review the film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  People with much more experience, knowledge, and writing skills have waxed rhapsodic about the importance and enjoyability of this film.  I will mention the endorsement of my 2-year-old son, however: this is the only "Princess" film he has ever asked to see.  Granted, he often picks "Cars" over Snow White, but he certainly asks for Snow White a lot.<br /><br />No, readers of this review are likely more interested in the various formats and qualities thereof.  Here I can offer some insight.  This 3-disc Blu-ray edition comes with a DVD copy of the film (which includes some extras not on the Blu-ray copy, so make sure you watch them both).  I've had no problems with this disc, and it looks and sounds just as good on my TV as the Blu-ray copy (42", same sound system).  The Blu-ray copy of the film also worked fine, but has the same annoying problems that Sleeping Beauty had: if you stop the disc, you cannot restart from where you left off, but are instead subjected to the FBI warnings, Disney propoganda, and menu navigation to get back to where you left off.  When you have small children, they are not going to watch the film all the way through every time!  And they are going to play with the remote control, etc.  This is incredibly frustrating and is not a function of Blu-ray discs in general: my Simpsons Movie Blu-ray, for example, acts like a DVD when stopped and restarted.<br /><br />The third disc contains extras.  The extras are fantastic.  No, better than that: they are FANTASTIC!!!  The highlights include an audio commentary by Walt Himself pieced together from audio recordings made in the late 1930s.  There are also lots of interviews and short video clips of other workers, including video of the director(s) setting up the multi-plane cameras, sound engineers discussing the relative merits of the echos in the men's vs. the women's bathrooms, and a promo film on Disneyland.  But best of all, there are included many of Disney's short films, most of which I hadn't seen before.  There's "Steamboat Willy" of course (the first Disney film to sync animation with sound), "The Old Mill" (first use of the multiplane camera), Flowers and Trees (first Technicolour cartoon and winner of an Oscar), Goddess of Spring (Persephone is often considered Disney's first attempt at a "realistic" human female character), and several others.  These shorts, and the technical introductions related to them, are themselves worth the price of the disc.<br /><br />Unfortunately.... Disney's Blu-rays are almost too annoying to actually watch.  As mentioned above, pressing stop (or turning off the power on your player) automatically resets the disc to the beginning.  I have a PS3 player, with load times on the order of seconds (5 or 6 at most).  So it was with some annoyance that I pressed stop and then timed how long it would take to get back to where I was in the disc.  The total time: 2 minutes and 33 seconds.  This is not straight running time either - I stood in front of the machine pressing the "Menu" and "Fast Forward" buttons on the remote whenever I had the chance.  Two and a half minutes to resume a film after just pressing "Stop" to go to the bathroom is unacceptable.  Having to watch the FBI warnings and Disney ads AGAIN is unacceptable.  Is Disney trying to drive people to piracy?  Because that is the effect that technical issues like this will create.  Memo to Disney: do not punish the people who are trying to be honest and actually buy your movies.  (And I didn't even mention the fact that I had to update my software before it would even let me watch the thing in the first place!  Aanother hour down the drain...at least I didn't have the kids crying because they couldn't start watching it right away.)</p></body></html>

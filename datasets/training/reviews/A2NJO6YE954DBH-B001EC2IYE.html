<meta name="summary" content="Looks like Oscars for Swank, Freeman, and Eastwood"></head><body><p>The first two acts of "Million Dollar Baby" are perfectly recognizable to fans of sports movies.  Once upon a time there was a crotchety old boxing trainer named Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), who was running an broken down gym.  One day Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) shows up and asks Dunn to train her, but Frankie does not train girls.  Maggie sticks around and picks up a few pointers from Eddie "Scarp-Iron" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), another former fighter who cleans up the joint.  Eventually Maggie's persistence wears down Frankie, and at the end of the first act he agrees to train her.<br /><br />Remember, he is crotchety and she is stubborn, so the training is problematic.  But eventually Maggie starts fighting and the second act moves, as all boxing films must, to the big fight.  At that point I was actually thinking of writing a review of "Million Dollar Baby" that would start by rewriting the lyrics to Alice Cooper's "Billion Dollar Babies."  Then, we get to the final act, at which point any and all thoughts of being cute with regards to this movie go away.  I had heard whispers about the last act, but conveniently forget all about them during the big fight.  One of the nice things about the legacy of "Rocky" is that we can never be sure which way these things are going to go (unless, of course, it is a true story).<br /><br />Because "Million Dollar Baby" is about the "freak show" of women boxing the screenplay by Paul Haggis (based on the "Rope Burns" stories of F.X. Toole) gets to have Maggie get really good really fast.  Of course she is helped as much by Frankie's wisdom as she is up her ability to hit really hard, but the competition is a lot less than it would be if this was the story of a thirty-something guy trying to become a championship boxer.  This is not to be disparaging to the idea, because one of the key subtexts of this story is how the dynamic is changed because Frankie is training a girl, and even if it is laid on thick (he is estranged from his only daughter and her daddy is long dead), Eastwood and Swank make it resonate.  The film also avoids conventions and pitfalls by being devoid of the presence of the press (who would have certainly killed the big payoff regarding a key Gaelic phrase).<br /><br />Apparently, Hillary Swank is going to be known as the "All or Nothing Girl," not to mention the bane of Annette Benning's existence, if she wins the Oscar again.  Between "Boys Don't Cry" and "Million Dollar Baby," her most notable film was "The Core," but if such drek gives her the money to live on waiting for these choice roles to come along and win Oscars, then that is certainly better than being a one Oscar wonder who gets one fantastic role and then slim pickings for eternity (e.g., Marlee Matlin). Despite her character being burdened by the conventional stereotypes of a white trash background, Swank keeps Maggie from becoming a caricature.  Much is made of the fact Swank does all of her own boxing (I like how she keeps her shoulders squared during her fights), but those are not her best acting moments in the film.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson was on the ESPN Hotseat when he was asked how cool he was on a scale of 1 to 10.  Jackson said 9, and when asked who was a 10 he immediately said Morgan Freeman.  The man has played the President of the United States and God, and in this movie he talks about having holes in his sox in a scene that be shown to acting students as an textbook example of the art.  In the 20th century there were three iconic actors representing three different traditions of acting: Laurence Olivier, Spencer Tracy, and Marlon Brando.  Freeman is the living embodiment of the Tracy "know your lines" school of acting.  If the award and standing ovation he got from the Screen Actors Guild last week is any indication, then the most respected actor in Hollywood is finally got to win a long overdue Oscar.<br /><br />Swank keeps touting this as Eastwood's best performance and in terms of acting it probably qualifies.  I still think of Eastwood in "The Bridges of Madison County" as his most engaging performance, and the one most like the actor in real life.  But for the most part as an actor Eastwood has moved from the squinting eyes of the Man With No Name to the memorable one-liners of Dirty Harry.  In "Unforgiven" and "Million Dollar Baby" he gets to move beyond such strictures and if my preference for the latter is because I like Eastwood better as a romantic figure, remember which of his performances I have enjoyed the most.<br /><br />If Eastwood wins an Academy Award this month it is probably going to be for Director rather than Best Actor, given he has already picked up the Golden Globe and Directors Guild of America awards.  I think the momentum towards Eastwood winning his second Oscar for directing started with last year's "Mystic River," arguably his most artistic effort as a director, but swamped by the sheer effort and success of Peter Jackson's trilogy of "The Lord of the Rings."  The common denominator remains that Eastwood has become an actor's director with three acting nominations and two wins for "Mystic River" and clear portends that is exactly what will happen again this year.  What is in question is whether "Million Dollar Baby" will be Eastwood's second Best Picture winner as well.  I would not be surprised, but at this point, having seen all five nominated films, the last Oscar of the evening is totally up for grabs (Update: Indeed Swank, Freeman, and Eastwood won Oscars for this film, which won Best Picture as well).</p></body></html>

The best thing about the movie is the unique way it tells the story. A young man named Jamal wins an insane amount of money on India's version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire." He is accused of cheating and is taken into custody. The authorities grill him on how a boy from the slums was able to answer every question on the show. Jamal explains question by question how he knew the answers, and also giving away his life story. This is an amazing story of a young man's life, and I enjoyed the music and the performances by the talented cast of unknowns. However, there were some major holes in the plot, and occasionally the characters' accents were so thick that it was hard to understand them. My favorite part of the movie is probably the credits, which are a lot of fun to watch. I recommend seeing this film, but don't understand why people went so crazy over it.</p></body></html>

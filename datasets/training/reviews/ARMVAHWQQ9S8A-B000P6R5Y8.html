When Hollywood focuses mainly on completely CGI movies that make subtle jokes about marijuana and flatulence, it makes a guy yearn for the movies of the nineties, the ones filled with wonder and heart.  Movies like "Indian in the Cupboard", "Lion King", and "Home Alone."  Movies like "Beethoven",  "The Land Before Time" (the original one), and any other classic that made the eyes well up.<br /><br />"Bridge to Terabithia" does just that--and more.<br /><br />This modest but fantastic movie centers around a young loner named Jess, and his relationship with the eccentric but quirky dreamer, Leslie, who has just moved into the house next to his.  The two of them travel through the woods, using their imagination to see ordinary happenings as magical events.  Together, they see squirrels and bullies as monsters they can defeat through cunning, and they see the woods as the fantastical land of Terabithia.<br /><br />This movie doesn't shy away from the rougher topics.  It gives a realistic portrayal of hardships kids face in school, the impact death has on people both young and old, friendship, imagination, family life, as well as religion.  These young actors, especially Annasophia Robb, who plays Leslie, and the young Bailee Madison, who plays Jess's younger sister May Belle.  Josh Hutcherson is also a standout as Jess, as is the music teacher who he has a crush on, acted perfectly by Zooey Deschanel.  Everything about this movie seems well balanced, perfect.<br /><br />This movie has what most other modern flicks lack, and that's heart.  And that makes this movie truly wonderful.  I'm going to go out and buy the book a-sap.<br /><br />10/10 Classic.</p></body></html>

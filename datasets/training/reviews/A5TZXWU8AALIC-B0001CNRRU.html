<meta name="summary" content="Three Stars for the Three Stars"></head><body><p>The three lead actors in this film give great performances, but I had a hard time getting emotionally involved because of the editing.  I'd been distracted by my curiosity of how the story was going to fall together.<br /><br />In a film like THE ENGLISH PATIENT (another non-linear storyline), the filmmakers gave you enough time to get involved with the plight of the characters.  In 21 GRAMS, the cuts are so abrupt and frequent that you never get a chance to really bond with the characters.<br /><br />Instead of feeling their pain, you're left saying, "Oh, that's how that fits together."<br /><br />But the three actors here are among the best acting in film today, so it's definitely worth seeing for that.</p></body></html>

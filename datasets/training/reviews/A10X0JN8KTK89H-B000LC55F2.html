<meta name="summary" content="The Pledge, The Turn, The Prestige - The Order and Production of Magic"></head><body><p>To explain precisely what I like about The Prestige would necessarily ruin the film for you, because it's the narrative structure that impresses me the most.  In many ways, the movie is about filmmaking, about telling a story, about suspending an audience's disbelief.  Because the story happens to be about magic and magicians, I watched the film more closely than I normally would.  I purposely distrusted everything, and so I saw the ending far before the credits rolled.  I still enjoyed the final reveal.<br /><br />This is not to say that the film is overly obvious.  On the contrary, it's quite magnificent in its resistance to being a period piece.  It's clear that the director, Christopher Nolan, wanted to interpret the Victorian Age for a modern audience.  I think we tend to look at the nineteenth century as a dirty, repressive era that erupted into the War to End All Wars.  There's likely some truth to that, but there was also majesty of invention and vibrancy of ideas.  This is the era directly before television, and all of the science that would later be concentrated as entertainment was still in the raw, and it captivated and motivated many famous minds.  Scientists of the Victorian Age approached science with much greater rashness and risk of physical harm than scientists do today.  Political correctness, frivolous lawsuits, restrictive grant procedures, and a beaten down sense of adventure have all conspired to stifle much of the passion and magic of scientific discovery.  Interestingly enough, much of what most of us know as science comes to us in the form of entertainment, a la Mythbusters and Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.  The Prestige reveals the birth of modern entertainment as the meeting of magic and science.<br /><br />The movie captures something else about the Victorian Age.  When you see a Victorian machine or tool, you see the labor and intellect that must have gone into its production.  When you look at your television or your dishwasher, there's nothing to see.  All of the humanity of invention is gone.<br /><br />The Prestige is not a perfect film.  When it turns its final few tricks, and the story becomes clear, you might review the film in your head and question Christian Bale's performance.  It seems like Nolan was too afraid to let Bale give any clues for fear of giving everything away.  At first, I was annoyed with the choppy storytelling, because it seemed like a cheap way to create suspense.  In the end, I still think it was cheap, but it works because the film, as I mention above, is on some level about filmmaking and the production of entertainment.<br /><br />My experience with the sound of the DVD was not favorable.  The dialogue is too quiet and muffled at times.  Nolan brings a lot of people (not only actors, but much of the crew) from Batman Begins, and the result is a movie that looks very similar.  David Bowie is a pleasant surprise as Tesla, one of the greatest scientists in history.<br /><br />Memento remains Nolan's masterpiece, but The Prestige will satisfy a much larger crowd.  I feel like Nolan had one important thing to film, which he announces in Following and finishes in Memento.  His post-Memento films seem to me to require much more work on his part, because he's trying to satisfy his Memento fans as well as appeal to a general audience.  The Prestige accomplishes this dual task quite well.</p></body></html>

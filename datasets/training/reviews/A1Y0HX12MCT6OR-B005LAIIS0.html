<meta name="summary" content="The Gey"></head><body><p>Call me a sucker for survival stories but when I first watched the Grey I expected Liam Neeson going out into the woods to punch wolves or something, so the story seemed dumb at first, but after watching it the first time I was blown away, it was entertaining throughout and each of the characters had more depth than I was expecting for this type of movie, it was tense, horrifying, exhilirating, and exciting.<br /><br />Then I watched it the second time with my girlfriend and she basically ruined it for me, somehow she knew that his wife was dead the whole time, asked how Liam Neeson fell out of the plane when he was buckled to three seats and there was no evidence that the seats themselves fell out, pointed out how the wolves politely waited for the men to have their moments talking with each other before attacking, and how Liam Neeson wasn't shivering violently after coming out of the freezing water. Damn.<br /><br />So maybe a bunch of dudes out in the wild fighting for survival is just a guy thing, so yeah it was a bit stupid at parts but I still found it very entertaining, and not something I'd expect from the director of Smokin' Aces and Narc. Also considering how many times Liam Neeson recited that poem they'd call this film The Fray?</p></body></html>

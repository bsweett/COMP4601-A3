<meta name="summary" content="Zombie Hand Wins"></head><body><p>As I have said in other reviews, the unrated versions of films on DVD have become the defacto Gold Standard.<br />I saw this film in theatre and I was wowed by the power and impact of film, even though the supernatural element seemed a little drained from the film.For someone like Rob Zombie, the surreal seems to reign supreme in his art, but that was in what I saw in the Booklet art of HELLBILLY DELUXE, however, in film Rob seems to want to go for the "real".<br /> The First part of the film was, as I understand it, shot basically shot in sequence, so that by the time they got to Institution sequences, not only has the Young actor playing Michael actually Grown, but Tyler Mane gets a chance to incorporate Young Michaels moves into his own styles.Probably the most shocking scenes and therefore the best items to watch and pick apart, take place at the Institution, the Truck Stop ( Ken Foree is just so Cool in a scene he makes so his own, even though you have two huge guys obviously trying to outdo each other, and this is more<br />so when you realise that the side of the stall they damage is NOT the stunt stall, its the real metal), and the element I find most surprising is that whilst Young Michael ( the actor) needs a stunt double, so does [ they said] the Huge Tyler Mane;Tyler Objected to the Double on one point, and the double for "Young Michael" is a girl... my question is, before hearing the commentary or the features, can you pick them ?<br />Anyways, This Unrated is a very well deserved edition. Expect more... you might even pick up some of the tricks on how Michael Hides in a shot, when he is 6'9 and hard to miss.<br /><br />DVD: The Bonus Features. Standout features on this are the deleted scenes or the Bloopers where Malcolm McDowell and Brad Douriff do a brilliant job at riffing off each other ( if only these two had been contracted to do a Commentary track with cast).The Features are worth it indeed. The Commentary however, is technically informative, but dry and unentertaining as you could have it. If they are going to have a film school class track, they could at least have an entertaining commentary track. Rob's "Commentary as Director" track has its purpose, but it needed a track for more entertaining elements.</p></body></html>

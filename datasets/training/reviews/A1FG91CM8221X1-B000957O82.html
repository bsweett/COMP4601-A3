<meta name="summary" content="Great stars, lousy script."></head><body><p>It isn't quite accurate to dismiss Andy Tennant's "Hitch" as just another silly romantic comedy. It is both less and more than that. The more I thought about the stupid, by-the-numbers script, the more I loathed it. But the extraordinary charm of the three lead actors make up for a great deal, if not for everything. Will Smith is the obvious reason why people are flocking to this film, and he's a better reason than usual for a movie like this. If there's ever been a black Cary Grant, then certainly it's Smith, with his smooth, airy yet masculine charm and seemingly effortless gift for comedy. He and his leading lady, Eva Mendes, have loads of sexy chemistry together, while as one of Smith's "Date Doctor" clients, Kevin James is the most lovable cinematic overweight slob since the late John Candy. (As a real-life overweight slob, I salute him.) But the script--OUCH! I cite only the most egregious example of its lameness and imbecility: toward the end of the movie, Mendes--jumping to conclusions on the flimsiest of evidence--takes actions that cause nearly irreparable harm not only to Smith, but also to James, whom she's never even met. Later on, she tells Smith, "I never meant to hurt you." Bullhockey! She obviously meant not only to hurt him, but to destroy both him and James utterly. Yet the mechanics of the script demand that we take her apology at face value and regard Smith as a big old meanie because he doesn't. In the absence of evidence that the scriptwriters actually thought Mendes' behavior was justifiable, I can only assume they wanted to create the obligatory complications toward Smith and Mendes getting together, and were either too lazy or too dumb to create good ones. So this movie gets three stars--one each for Smith, Mendes, and James--and absolutely none for the script.</p></body></html>

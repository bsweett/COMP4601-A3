<meta name="summary" content="My big fat current favorite"></head><body><p>Word of mouth carried this nifty big fat movie right up the popularity scales. Women rolling their eyes and swearing 'You've GOT to see it!' guaranteed a long run. Toula, so beautifully played by Nia Vardalos, seems destined to homely spinsterhood when she hits 30 - but she's far from resigned. It's her Old World papa who's the major road block. Mama, Toula, and auntie conspire to circumvent his strictures, and Toula goes to school - with a new hairdo, some new clothes, and too much makeup.<br />And falls in love with a WASP. And he falls for her. And of course they eventually get married, hence the title of the flick. But the process is the product, in this case, and the slow process of winning over her deeply ethnic family is the delight of this wonderful, hilarious, and ultimately compassionate film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Robocop(1987)"></head><body><p>Robocop(1987) is a classic, action packed sci-fi film. It's also packed with social satire and dark humor. This is the strongest of the three Robocop movies. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven(Spetters, Soldier of Orange) does a superb job directing the film. Alex Murphy(Peter Weller) is killed by criminals in a run down, dystopian, futuristic Detroit. State of the art cybernetics resurrect him as a crime fighting robot police officer. Nancy Allen is very good as Anne Lewis, Robocop's partner. She's sexy, robust, and convincing as a tough, sympathetic woman. I am glad I didn't watch Carrie(1976) first!<br />Kurtwood Smith(That 70's Show, Star Trek) is effective as low life crime boss Clarence Boddicker. Ronny Cox is good as a corrupt OCP executive and Miguel Ferrer plays a corrupt, ego-driven, Frankenstein-like creator of the Robocop Program.<br />Robocop takes place in the not-too-distant future, but it spoofs the 1980's era it was made in. When I saw Robocop on TV, the violence and foul language was heavily censored. The late Basil Poledouris wrote a superb music score for Robocop. It's driven by synthesizers, but sounds more symphonic as Robocop slowly becomes human again. I remember TV spots for Robocop action figures for children. Wasn't Robocop an R-rated movie? Nevermind. Robocop spawned two sequels, a live action TV show, an animated TV show, a mini-series on the Sci-Fi Channel, and some weird TV spot in Korea where Robocop tried to eat fried chicken! Crow from Mystery Science Theater 3000 once poked fun of Robocop's nemesis, ED-209("They can't make a robot that can walk down stairs?"). Robocop is a keeper.</p></body></html>

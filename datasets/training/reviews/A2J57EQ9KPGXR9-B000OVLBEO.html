<meta name="summary" content="Geat Film Adaptation of a mediocre comic."></head><body><p>Unlike the uneven "Punisher" film and the dismal "Fantastic Four", Ghost Rider succeeds due to its interesting premise, great casting, great special effects and great villians.<br /><br />The comic on which the movie is based has gone through alot of changes itself; from a standard superhero-with-a-gimmick story to a Clive Barkerish action/horror graphic novel. Fortunately for the movie audience, the screenwriters chose the latter theme.<br /><br />This one is well worth your time..</p></body></html>

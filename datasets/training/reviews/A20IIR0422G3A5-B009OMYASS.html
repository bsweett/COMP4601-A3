Great DVD Extras."></head><body><p>`Hostel', is the second film written and directed by Eli Roth, whose first film was the popular horror film, `Cabin Fever'. `Hostel' is also prominently `executive produced' by Quentin Tarantino, who seems to aspire to be the Steven Spielberg of the fantasy / horror set. Aside from a few ideas and a clip on the TV in one scene from `Pulp Fiction', it is not exactly what Tarantino lends the movie aside from his very influential name.<br /><br />`Hostel' is an exceedingly scary movie, primarily because everything about its premise is totally believable. It is so believable, in fact, that the director states that the premise is based loosely on actual events. While the story has a strong affinity to `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', it may be even more powerful in that it is set in the heart of a very civilized central Europe (It was all actually filmed in and around Prague, in the Czech Republic, however, most fictional action supposedly takes place in Bratislava, in Slovakia, the other half of the former Czechoslovakia.) This simply lovely backdrop of old European civility makes the foreground story even more horrific.<br /><br />I hope I don't give too much away by saying that the story actually owes a lot more to Richard Condon's short story, `The Dangerous Game' than it does to anything done by Tobe Hooper. While I have no evidence that Roth has read Condon, there have been enough knockoffs of Condon's plot that Roth probably got wind of the story line without actually reading the original short story. And, many of the images, although little of the plot, probably also owe a lot to the great Dustin Hoffman / Lawrence Olivier thriller, `Marathon Man' and its scenes of truly malicious dental torture.<br /><br />While this is a strongly original horror flick, there are some weaknesses which, however, will not deter me from giving this DVD the full five stars, since the extras are so good, they easily make up for lapses due, primarily, to low budgeting. The DVD has five, count em, five commentary tracks by various combinations of director and producer, executive producer, cinematographer, and monologue. Roth says there are so many simply because he has so much to say about the film. These features make the movie an excellent purchase.<br /><br />The primary weakness is the fact that the actual scenes of mayhem are almost, but not quite as good as the famous, original `Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. They will certainly not satisfy the masochists among the audience who watch `King Kong' primarily for the scene where the big ape meets the hapless blond. It is much more of a truer representative of sadism from the sadist's point of view (read the original `Justine' to see what I mean) rather than the sanitized sadism seen from the point of view of the masochist / submissive. The victims in this movie are NOT having fun.<br /><br />The commentaries give a lot of information on the kinds of decisions that go into casting movies, such as the decision not to cast Rutger Hauer, for example, in the role as the lead heavy, if only because Hauer has played that role so many times before, that his appearance would give away a lot of the surprise.<br /><br />There are a lot of minor plot twists that border on the brilliant in their originality. The most interesting is the role-played by the band of Bratislava street urchins. Fagin would have been proud of these lads.<br /><br />A very chilling and entertaining DVD.</p></body></html>

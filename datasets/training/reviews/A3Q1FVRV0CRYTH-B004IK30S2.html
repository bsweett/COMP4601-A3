<meta name="summary" content="Not his greatest film, 'Anchorman' still proves that Will Ferrell OWNS his movies..."></head><body><p>I personally feel that Will Ferrell is one of the funniest men alive.  He makes everything he touches hysterical and worth watching, to me at least.  I do know those who can't stand him...those people I am not friends with...HA.  Anyways, so that said I couldn't believe it took me so long to see `Anchorman' but it was just one of those movies that slipped through the cracks for me, despite the fact that all my friends kept insisting I watch it.  So, after watching `Talladega Nights' I just knew I had to see `Anchorman' ASAP.<br /><br />While I don't feel it's as much a riot as `Talladega Nights', `Anchorman' still holds my attention and induces quite a few belly laughs.  The whole idea of Ron Burgandy (Ferrell) fighting to keep his position as the favored anchorman after the hot young thing Veronica Corningstone (Applegate truly holding her own against this hilarious cast) comes into the station and threatens to steal his thunder.  Aided by his all male posse, including Paul Rudd, David Koechner (gets a bit obnoxious and annoying at times) and the hilarious Steve Carell, Ron does his best to distress Veronica in an attempt to get her fired and or to quit.<br /><br />The whole erection scene (sorry, I had to bring it up) while at first had me thinking "not again, does every comedy have to do this" really turned out to be one of the funniest scenes in the film...that whole "It's an optical illusion" line was brilliant.  I've only seen the unrated version so I'm not sure what all is different so if I mention a scene that you haven't seen or that you don't see after renting it then I'm sorry...must not be on the theatrical version.  Just look for the Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Tim Robbins cameo scene...it's outrageous, unrealistic and brilliantly hysterical.<br /><br />Great Ferrell comedy that is sure to please any of his true fans, and just might gain him new ones.  I'd recommend `Talladega Nights' over this film only because it never lets up and never gets even the slightest bit annoying...</p></body></html>

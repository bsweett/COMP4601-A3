<meta name="summary" content="The Prestige"></head><body><p>Rupert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale), along with Rupert's wife, Julia (Perabo), are assistants to a magician at the turn of the twentieth century.  Alfred causes a trick to go wrong, and Julia dies.  Rupert blames Alfred, and the friends become enemies.  They not only attempt to out-do each other on stage, but also attempt to actively sabotage and hurt each other.  Soon, Rupert is off to Colorado Springs to meet with Nikola Tesla (Bowie).  Tesla has created an integral part of Alfred's show, and Rupert is determined to get a similar device and top Alfred once again.<br /><br />The story is told with three storylines, alternating between the three.  Parts of one storyline that make no sense at first become clear as the other storylines progress.  Even the murder at the very beginning is not what it seems.  Christopher Nolan has once again constructed a fascinating tale, this time of obsession and the price that people pay for their obsessions.  The cast is solid all around.  Bale and Jackman, as the leads, own their roles and breathe life into their respective characters.  Michael Caine, as their assistant, steals just about every scene he is in.  Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall as the love interests both do credible jobs.  And finally, David Bowie makes Tesla into a memorable character.  This is a great, entertaining movie.  Christopher Nolan has quickly proved himself to be a great director.  "The Prestige" helps to solidify that.  I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

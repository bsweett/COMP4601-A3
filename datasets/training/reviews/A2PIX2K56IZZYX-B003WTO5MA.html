<meta name="summary" content="Ya know, for a remake, not too bad.........."></head><body><p>I loathe remakes, I really do, but I must confess, this was not half bad. I would go as far as to say this was a cut above the original. Why? you ask, well the original was over 2 hours and didn't need to be, and the acting was pretty poor, this version cuts the time down to 88 minutes and the acting is much, much better. George Lutz was played well by Ryan Reynolds, one of the hotter actors in Hollywood, and deserved, he has a special charisma and charm, plus he's a pretty damn good actor. It doesn't hurt that he has an incredible body with abs any man would kill for, and in his last 2 movies (Blade 3 and this one)<br />he is constantly running around without a shirt on, much to my wife and women everywhere's delight. Melissa George does a pretty good Margot Kidder, but it's the children that really steal the show. The younger daughter is excellent, as she is the one who can see Jody, one of the girls shot in the house, and Jody is not a very nice little girl, check out the scene with the babysitter locked in the closet, awesome segment.<br /><br />The two sons are also strong, the older one has some intense scenes with Reynolds chopping wood, which is very creepy in a subdued sorta way.<br /><br />My problems with the film? not too much, but the CG during the famous "flies" scene is a little weak and the ending is a bit anti-climatic, but those are both minor flaws in an over-all fun horror movie.<br /><br />In recent years, remakes are coming out all over the place, Bewitched, Longest Yard, Bad News Bears, Charlie and the Chocolate factory, and must are a major disaster, but this one succeeds and it was nice to see. Ryan Reynolds is going to be huge, with recent release "Waiting" looking like it is going to be a minor hit and a holiday movie coming with the previews looking like it could be alot of fun(cuz you know previews are never wrong)<br /><br />So, if ya want a fun, solid horror movie and High Tension and Devil's Rejects is checked out, get this, I think you'll be impressed.<br /><br />acting.........3.5 stars, Reynolds and his abs rule the day<br />directing......4 stars, Very well done for a remake<br />special effects...3.5 stars, CG is weak, but the rest is creepy<br />horror rating....3.5 stars, A few chills, nothing serious<br />quality........4 stars, Great looking movie, house looks scary</p></body></html>

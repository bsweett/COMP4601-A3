<meta name="summary" content="A disturbing and brutally violent remake......that I sorta liked"></head><body><p>It's hard to recommend this new version of Halloween because it's brutal and disturbing but well acted and well made. The body count increased incredibly in this remake. I can't even count how many people died in the movie.<br /><br />  The movie is creepy and scary and despite how awfully violent it is I couldn't keep my eyes off it. I might need therapy for that reason though. This is probably the most insane movie I have seen, well next to Devil's Rejects anyway. Rob Zombie is a good director but.....the movie is a bit over done. We didn't need the body count to be even bigger this time around.<br /><br />  Seeing person after person die brutally tends to get tiresome and hard to watch and it even holds the movie down from being great. There's a little too many un-needed killings in the movie. Rob Zombie went all out when he really didn't have to. He loses focus on the main story by having sooo many side characters brutally murdered.<br /><br />  The movie is gripping especially at the end but the beginning drags on too long and is a bit depressing despite a creepy performance by the kid who plays young Michael. Sarah Moon also does good work as his mother and you feel bad for her since she clearly loves her child who broke her heart by going all psycho. Rob Zombie pulls off giving us a film that's a bit different, so if you are avoiding it because you feel as if you seen it already, don't avoid it for that reason. You might want to avoid it due to being so over the top violent though.</p></body></html>

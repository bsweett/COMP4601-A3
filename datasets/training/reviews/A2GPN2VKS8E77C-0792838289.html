<meta name="summary" content="A Great And Controversial Cold War Epic Movie Event!!"></head><body><p>John Frankenheimer (no relation to Jerry Bruckheimer) directs this adaptation of Richard Condon's book, with a terrific screenplay by George Axelrod, casting legendary crooner/actor Frank Sinatra as Major Bennett Marco, a former Army Officer plagued by nightmares from the Korean War. Laurence Harvey is excellent as Raymond Shaw, Marco's fellow officer who Marco suspects of having been brainwashed during the war. Angela Lansbury (TV's "Murder She Wrote" and the voice of Mrs. Potts in Walt Disney's classic tale "Beauty And The Beast" [see my review on it]) is terrific in an Oscar-nominated performance as the utterly ruthless Mrs. Iselin, Shaw's mother. Janet Leigh (pre-"Psycho") is cast in a small role as Marco's girlfriend. The film's plot was a little confusing to me at the beginning, but it doesn't detract from the film's greatness. Special features include an audio commentary, featurettes and the original theatrical trailer. Can't wait to see the remake with Academy Award winners Denzel Washington as Major Bennett Marco and Meryl Steep as Mrs. Iselin. This version is rated PG for some thematic elements and mild language.</p></body></html>

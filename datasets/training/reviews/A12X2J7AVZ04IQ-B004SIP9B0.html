<meta name="summary" content="At home with the Royal Family..."></head><body><p>I enjoyed the film on first viewing and was indeed amazed with Helen Mirren's performance, so loaded with nuance and pensiveness. Of course, no one rally knows what goes on behind closed doors at the Royal Palace, so the ingenuity of director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan were put to task and have created a witty and fascinating scenario. Then I listened to the DVD commentary track and realized that there were dozens of in-jokes, many of which were ultimately cut.  There's a moment when Tony Blair (brilliantly played by Michael Sheen) points out that the queen was literally forced into her position, giving up any sense of a normal life. When the Queen sees the beautiful stag, wandering freely, always in danger, I almost thought that she wished she could trade places. Later, she was more concerned about the ultimate fate of the stag that she altered her plans. I liked Helen McCrory as Mrs. Blair, the voice of public opinion regarding the Royal Family, especially at the beginning. Prince Phillip was presented (by James Cromwell) as somewhat of a buffoon, and I enjoyed Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother.Alex Jennings was very good as Prince Charles, hoping that Tony Blair would "modernize" things in England so he could relax a bit. Everything's been said before by previous reviewers, but these were my impressions. I enjoyed the film a lot, and Mirren's complex portrayal was as complete as I could only guess.</p></body></html>

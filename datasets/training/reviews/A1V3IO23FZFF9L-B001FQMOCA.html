<meta name="summary" content="Joaquin is awesome"></head><body><p>Phoenix is great as Cash. He has the look and the voice. The same can be said for Witherspoon. The plot is good and interesting, but it gets a little boring at some moments. The movie has great music and a good feel. Oscar material.</p></body></html>

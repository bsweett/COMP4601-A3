<meta name="summary" content="Very Solid"></head><body><p>Looking at this movie as just a movie, it was as well done technically and as well acted as any movie I can remember.  I particularly liked the the air controllers in Boston and NY<br /><br />The roles of the the Army officers and the head of airline control were done very well.  The cluelessness of some of the soldiers at the idea that it might be a real war situation while the officers try to get them in the right mindset.  It's not an encouraging image but would be a true one.<br /><br />The passengers on the plane radiated normalcy, we don't see any special stories highlighted, and no attempt was made to even identify them.  This was a VERY powerful device as it stressed that these people could have been any American.  I don't know if the idea of the European passenger wanting NOT to act was a plot device or not, it made me smirk.<br /><br />The actors who played the hijackers were first rate, we of course don't know the mind of these men so the greatest liberties had to be taken with them.  It is a tough role and they pulled it off well.<br /><br />It is Ironic that I saw this movie with my son just after watching Tora Tora Tora.  Even though my father fought in the pacific during the war I found myself reacting very differently to the two movies.  I suspect because one group is reactive (soldiers obeying orders of Japan) and another group who could have at any time decided not to do what they set out to do.<br /><br />As far as my feelings about the movie, I was over a friends house  on Sept 11 playing in a tabletop baseball league.  The planes hitting the towers didn't really phase me as I assumed it was terror, when the news of flight 93 passengers fighting back and stopping that plane from it's target THAT's when it hit me.  The last 5 minutes of this movie fill me with great satisfaction.  I kept finding myself saying don't wait don't wait.  You KNEW that they wouldn't get to the contols in time to save the plane, but you still wanted it to happen.<br /><br />Watch it.</p></body></html>

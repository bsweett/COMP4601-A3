<meta name="summary" content="Very funny movie with some very special performances"></head><body><p>This is a very funny movie.  At points, its crudity goes beyond my taste, but I can live through them to enjoy the rest of the jokes.  Will Ferrell as Ricky Bobby is certainly the point of the film, but his performance is only one of the thrill rides in this amusement park.  Let's start with Gary Cole and Jane Lynch as Ricky's parents, Reese and Lucy Bobby.  They set the perfect tone for the film in the opening scene racing towards (and past) the hospital when she is just about to give birth to our hero.  Reese has some wonderful moments in the film, such as the career day appearance when Ricky is in grade school, or the family dinner at Applebee's that is going so well that it makes him uncomfortable.  Or what about the time that he finally goes to pick up the pair of tickets that Ricky has been leaving for him at every race for years (that the ticket sellers resell and pocket the cash)?<br /><br />When Ricky is down so low that he has to go live with his mom, Lucy is masterful with his ratbag kids and provides some of the great fun in the film.  She is a terrific character.  John C. Reilly is perfect as Ricky's best friend, Cal Naughton, Jr. and is the anchor that provides a foundation that allows Ferrell to soar as Ricky.  Cal is the one that came up with their "Shake and Bake" slogan and is willing to always come in second to Ricky's first.  Until he can't anymore.  His finding out that being on top isn't exactly what he was looking for in life is even a bit touching.<br /><br />Leslie Bibb provides the right amount of babeness and avaricious romance to the film as she claims Ricky and then Cal when Ricky can't get her what she wants anymore (and in neither case is it the man).  Carley is a tough role to get just right because we have to like her, maybe even attracted to her, and yet she has to be a bit creepy.<br /><br />Greg German and Molly Shannon as the team owners (the Denits) also get their roles just right.  Larry Denit is a hateful, and we gather impotent, owner who got the racing team from Daddy and resents everyone on the team who is able to do things he can't do except for the money he got from his pa.  Mrs. Dennit is fully aware of the ridiculous situation and takes her comfort from booze, from flirting with Denit's big ticket customers, and the vibrations of the track as the cars zoom by.<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen as Jean Girard is most everyone's delight in the film.  And while it is a whacky character that helps Ricky Bobby to get even weirder, I thought the accent was so awkward and the emphasis on his being gay so over done that I found the role to be a net negative.  However, that is just me and I recognize that others think this guy is a comedy genius.  And I know that taking risks means at times doing things that don't work.  I am not saying the Girard role doesn't work, but I didn't find it wonderful.  Weird isn't wonderful or brilliant.  It is just weird.<br /><br />While Will Ferrell gets a lot of attention for running around in his underwear or less, for me the perfect moments in the film were his first interview with the ESPN guy, the scene at the bar with Susan (Amy Adams), and learning to drive again with his dad.  That and the knife in the leg scene at the hospital with Lucius (Michael Clark Duncan) and Cal.<br /><br />A pretty funny movie that people will laugh with for a long time.</p></body></html>

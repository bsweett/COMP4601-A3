<meta name="summary" content="Where's Khan When You Need Him?"></head><body><p>In 1979, Robert Wise's (West Side Story, The Sound of Music, The Haunting) highly budgeted, enormously special effects laden, immensely epic, and dramatically devoid of feeling Star Trek: The Motion Picture hit theaters around with the world introducing new fans to the new continuing chronicles of Admiral James T. Kirk, stoic Science Officer Spock, and sardonically comedic Doctor Leonard &quot;Bones&quot; Mc Coy. In the vast horizon of space, there appears to be an immensely lethal gigantic space being intelligence on a direct collision course with the planet Earth. So of course the United Federation of Planets allows recently promoted Admiral Kirk to helm the U.S.S. Enterprise on an extremely vital emergency mission to investigate the mystery alien's intentions. Unfortunately for all but the most blindly devoted of the Trekkie fan base, the film lacked the one crucial engineering ingredient that made the original series glisten amongst all the other one-dimensionally conventional entertainment at the time, character and humanity.<p>Though we do see momentary glimpses of the Shatner/Nimoy/Kelly character dynamic that propelled the original series ascendance into the syndication stratosphere, Star Trek: The Motion Picture creatively concentrates on a mightily bland ambiguous creature that never really fulfills on it's promise of threat to the audience, adheres too stridently to an old Hollywood pacing structure (form the 50's and 60's) that clashes as badly Star Trek as badly as platform shoes stand out at a Moshe pit, focuses on a very uninteresting romance between the first officer and a bald female navigator (both before and after one of them becomes an android), and horrendously confuses telling a intensely jargon-filled space odyssey with that of concocting a compelling movie. <p>All in all, despite an all-star cast, mind bogglingly excellent special effects, and a superbly noteworthy soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith (that track was later re-used in the vastly popular Star Trek: The Next Generation), Star Trek: The Motion Picture fails to go where almost all of it's sequels later went on to do, make an entertaining picture. <p>As for the upcoming Star Trek: the Motion Picture Director's Cut DVD Special Edition, it's intended to included a marvelously remastered anamorphic widescreen presentation, a Robert Wise commentary track, 3 documentaries, 11 deleted scenes, and more impressive Star Trek options to shake a replicated steak at. <p>Highly recommended for any Trekkie with a thirst for antiquity, but for all other indifferent non-fans stay as far away from this as you would from the Influencian Flu or Barclay's Proto-morphosis Syndrome.</p></body></html>

Everybody griped about how bad Ang Lee's Hulk was and how this version was so much better. After all, with this Hulk you had one of the Hulk's old nemesis in the Abomination, which promised way more action. Also, with this hulk, you had not one but two credible actors in Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs) and Edward Norton (Fight Club) albeit with an unknown director in Louis Letterier. All the critics raved that this Hulk had not only vindicated Ang Lee's so-called debacle, but that this Hulk almost rivaled the much vaunted Iron Man. So, I guess, I had to check the Hulk out for myself and see if all the salivation and sloppy oral service was worth it.<br /><br />It wasn't. First, the story was a cliche bastard, meaning that Marvel goofed. Anyone who's read the comic knows the true origin of how Dr. Robert Bruce Banner (not David damnit)became the Hulk. I won't go into a long explanation of how Bruce Banner became the Hulk, but it sure wasn't the way the writers of this movie portrayed Bruce Banner becoming the Hulk. I won't ejaculate on how counterfeit this movie was; instead, I'll stick to the merits of this movie--there were hardly any. I thought this Hulk would have more action. More action?!There were only two or three Hulk sequences in the entire film, and those sequences were abbreviated and inebriated. The special effects of this Hulk were less sophisticated than the special effects in the first (Ang Lee's) Hulk. Hulk looked like a big, green, veiny wad of rubber. Actually, he looked like an alien erection. If you've yet to see this Hulk, imagine this: choke down four sloppy double-cheese white castles, a jar of jalepenos, a bean burrito with guacamole sauce, an oxtail, a bowl of hot chili, and a couple of warm beers. A few hours later, take a crap, then turn around and look at what you did--that's the Hulk. Tim Roth and Ed Norton are great actors, but this movie proves that--no matter who's the star and no matter how awesome the intentions-- you need good writing. Take a look at the Batman franchise prior to Christopher Nolan. Batman was the Ocean's Eleven of superhero movies--a vehicle for big stars to get a lot of underserved publicity and to get an easy paycheck. Batman had gotten so putrid that George Clooney GEORGE CLOONEY played Batman. People have midget memories. Think back! Batman was camp fodder before Nolan took over and made it respectable again, or probably for the first time ever. Ang Lee tried to make the Hulk respectable and, to this reviewer, he did make this movie respectable, much more so than this dumb version of the Hulk which couldn't seem to make up its mind on what movie it wanted to sample. First, it wanted to be King Kong by taking the woman up to a cave overlooking the city, then he breaks out hollering and screaming like a damn idiot. Then, at the end of the movie, the Hulk goes away bouncing off of buildings a la Spiderman. This franchise needs an injection of heart and commitment, not more Gumby-like special effects. I'm tired of superhero movies.<br /><br />author of Gotta Be Down!</p></body></html>

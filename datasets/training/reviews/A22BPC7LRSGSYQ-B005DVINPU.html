<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding 1989 version of this classic comic book character"></head><body><p>I saw Batman (1989) in the theater when it was released in 1989 and was very impressed with it.  It's very entertaining and well balanced between action scenes and slower-moving scenes. The overall atmosphere of the movie is very much on the dark side, which is something that works very well, in my opinion.  If you've seen other Tim Burton movies and like his style, then this movie should please you as well.  The dark feel of Gotham City gives the movie a feeling of dreariness and mysteriousness. The street scenes in Gotham City portray a city with lots of crime and chaos, yet the movie maintains a true comic book feel.  Tim Burton definitely created a vintage comic book movie, and that's really how a Batman movie should be.<br /><br />Michael Keaton does a great job playing Bruce Wayne/Batman. His portrayal of Bruce Wayne is that of a mysterious guy with an alter ego that he's concealing for most of the movie. He is overshadowed somewhat by the performance of Jack Nicholson as The Joker. Nicholson's performance is classic, and in my opinion, the best acting he's done in his entire career. The Joker in this movie is a psychotic killer who doesn't hesitate to poison Gotham City, whether by Smilex gas or contaminated hygiene products, and doesn't think anything of bumping off his own right hand man, Bob. This was the first movie ever made where the true nature of The Joker is exposed, which is more accurate to the comic book Joker. Batman: The Movie (1966) and the 1960s TV series didn't allow Cesar Romero to portray the Joker in a psychotic way. Instead, Romero's Joker was made into a funny thief. This was completely fine for the campy TV series, and Romero was an outstanding Joker with incredible talent.  Nicholson's Joker, on the other hand, is a balanced mixture of dark humor and evil, which is what a true Joker should be like. His wardrobe and makeup are outstanding, not to mention that permanent grin is incredibly creepy. The Joker gets darker and more evil as the movie progresses. For fans of this iconic villain, I highly recommend seeing this movie and the legendary performance of Nicholson.  In my opinion, Nicholson OWNS Heath Ledger when it comes to portraying The Joker.<br /><br />Other strong performances are by Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, Robert Wuhl as Alexander Knox, Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon, Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent, Jack Palance as Boss Carl Grissom, and Michael Gough as Alfred. It's a very entertaining movie that is often compared to The Dark Knight, but usually loses. Personally, I prefer this movie to The Dark Knight. One of the best things in this movie is the score by Danny Elfman. The music fits the scenes so well and has become a timeless, classic score over the years. I highly recommend this movie.  I also highly recommend buying the score.</p></body></html>

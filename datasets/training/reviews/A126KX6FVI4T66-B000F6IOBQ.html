<meta name="summary" content="Sex and violence , the new generation?"></head><body><p>The movies is well written, well produced and well acted...<br />it is just black and a very lot of blood ( eaten and spilled)<br />and filmed darkly.<br />We have a clan of vampires and a clan of werewolves at war, with a<br />dark satanic vampire lord trying to free his werewolf brother.<br />The heroes are out to slay him and his brother<br />and save the world from inhuman immortal monster rule.<br />Since it takes place mostly in Eastern Europe,<br />it has a sort of Russian brooding darkness as well.<br />I really just don't like vampire pictures!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Film Adaptation Of Fifth Harry Potter Novel"></head><body><p>The filmmakers had to make some tough choices in deciding what  to include when adapting the lengthy ORDER OF THE PHOENIX for the movies and for the most part they have done a great job.  The sequence where Mr. Weasley is attacked seems a bit rushed and if I hadn't read the book I might not have understood what was happening there.  I also would have liked to have seen Neville visiting his parents at St. Mungo's though that might have been too poignant of a scene for this all ready quite dark movie and the Longbottoms's situation is discussed.  One of the greatest pleasures of this series is seeing the child actors  growing up from kids to teenagers and all the major players both teens and adults  do a great job.  Imelda Staunton is comically loathsome as Dolores Umbridge and I think we've all known her slightly less exaggerated counterparts in the muggle world. I've always been a fan of both Helena Bonham-Carter and Emma Thompson each now in  middle age and wonderful in character parts in this film as the evil deranged witch Bellatrix and the hapless divination teacher Sybil Trelawney respectively.  As in all the previous Potter movies special acting honors should go to Alan Rickman for playing so well the complex and enigmatic Snape.  And the set and special effects look absolutely spectacular on the screen.  One caution the dementors in the opening scene, Harry's visions and the battle scenes are all very intense so think carefully about taking kids under ten.</p></body></html>

He had previously won an Oscar for the Best Live Action Short in 2005 for "Six Shooter."  The film mixes comedy and blood in an oddball romp.  Colin Farrell who is well known for films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FIHN5M">Ask the Dust</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000189LE2">Veronica Guerin</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLQN">Phone Booth</a> does a good job as the jumpy assassin Ray.  Ray makes the mistake in a church hit of accidentally blowing the head off of a young boy.  This causes he & his partner Ken to lay low for a while in Bruges, Belgium, a town where purportedly nothing ever happens.  Ken is played by Brendan Gleeson who is perhaps best known as Evil Eye in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7414C">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Widescreen Edition)</a> as well as his appearance in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001MDP3G">Cold Mountain (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>.  The fact that Ken is gay and Ray is not does cause a bit of restlessness, particularly on the part of Ray who anxiously waits to go round the town where he bumps into a girl watching a film being made.  Their boss Harry calls Ken and tells him to put a hit on Ray, which then has bad guy chasing bad guy.  Ralph Fiennes who had Oscar nominations for "Schindler's List" & "The English Patient" shows up to finish the job Ken apparently couldn't do.  Eric Godon makes a nice appearance as the lowlife Yuri.  This film is pure black comedy with the emphasis on characterization and finding levels even within a criminal life.  This classic marriage of opposites worked for me.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

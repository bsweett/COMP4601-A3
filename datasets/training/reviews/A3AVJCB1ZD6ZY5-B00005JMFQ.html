<meta name="summary" content="I think only a British comedy could pull this one off"></head><body><p>"Love, Actually" could have been titled "Love, Almost" with an American director.  With new fewer than eight couples vying for attention in this cameo-laden romantic comedy, you need a score card to keep up--and yes, everyone does win, more or less.<br /><br />We start at the top, brand new Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) just moves in to fall in love with the girl who brings him coffee. Liam Neeson is helping his grade school stepson win the heart of the very young woman he loves. Emma Thompson is on the bittersweet end as she tries to wrap her head around the idea that her husband, Alan Rickman might be cheating with an office girl.<br /><br />And that's not all...The stories are heartfelt with just enough British irony to keep you laughing instead of falling into a sucrose induced coma. Kudos for producer, Curtis, for giving this story enough spice to keep it real and interesting.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, June 2008</p></body></html>

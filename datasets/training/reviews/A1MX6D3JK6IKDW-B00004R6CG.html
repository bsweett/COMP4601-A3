The film was then out of circulation for years afterwards for reasons that I'm too lazy to look up.In those intervening years,however, I came to realize what I was missing: a really terrific film that seems to captivate all age groups, even the most restless of children and adolescents.Which brings to mind another Hitchcock trait: his films are almost impossible to compare. Granted, "Vertigo" may not stand up as well as "Psycho" as far as multiple viewings are concerned, yet the quality of the photography, the interweaved plots and subplots, the overall dimensions of the story itself, leave the viewer almost completely agog at film's end.The irony, as others have mentioned,that this film never won the acclaim it deserved, may in fact be its highest compliment. What award has the "Mona Lisa" ever won?</p></body></html>

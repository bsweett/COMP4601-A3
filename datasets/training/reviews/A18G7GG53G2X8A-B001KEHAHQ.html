Indeed, laughter was quite infrequent the day I saw it; I guess today's audiences don't see the humor in physically and emotionally tormenting a Chief Inspector or in breaking wind inside of a supposedly soundproof recording booth. And yet, for its many, many flaws, I have to admit that the film wasn't as overwhelmingly awful as I expected it to be.<br /><br />Still, I can't recommend this film. It's nothing but a mesh of uninspired slapstick, shallow verbal gags, and annoyingly predictable outcomes. In other words: it's nothing we haven't already seen a thousand times before in other lowbrow comedies. I'm waiting for the day when the definition of "remake" veers away from "to dumb down and compromise the integrity of the original." I'm also waiting for the day when Hollywood realizes that remaking every movie released before 1980 is unnecessary. I do feel that certain films benefit greatly from a reinterpretation, especially when the originals were released before the technology, the directors, or the actors were around to do the story justice. But when a film was well made to begin with, like the original "Pink Panther" was, then I only have this to say: if it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br /><br />For this new version, Steve Martin (using an annoyingly exaggeraged French accent) replaces Peter Sellers as Jacques Clouseau, the well-intentioned but incurably inept French inspector. He's called upon by the arrogant and mean spirited Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) to solve the mystery behind the murder of soccer coach Yves Gluant (Jason Stratham in a very small role) and the disappearance of his obscenely large ring set with the Pink Panther diamond. The prime suspect is his fiancee, Xania (Beyonce Knowles), who happens to be a world famous pop singer.<br /><br />Of course, she's not the only suspect. At one point, one of Gluant's players says to the murderer (whose identity is still hidden), "Oh, it's you." This prompts Clouseau to round up every person in France by the name of Yu, the number of which is more than 27,000. Not surprisingly, this insane method of suspect elimination is not followed up as the plot advances. However, we are treated to one interrogation of an old Chinese woman (who, as you can probably guess, is unable to speak French).<br /><br />At Clouseau's side is Gendarme Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno), a lower rank officer assigned to assist Clouseau and to keep him at bay (the latter of which he fails at miserably). It's quite obvious who the more competent crime solver in this duo is. Why else would he be able to foil Clouseau's attempts to attack him without warning (supposedly to keep him alert)? Even though they're supposed to be an odd couple, the chemistry just isn't there. It was almost as if they were in two completely different films. Maybe it would have helped if Reno had chosen to make his character a little quirkier as opposed to playing it straightforwardly. He's so bland and uninteresting, and that doesn't fit with a "Pink Panther" movie. That could be one of the reasons why the original 1963 film had so many sequels.<br /><br />When Clouseau learns that Xania has left for America, he decides that, if he's to follow her, he must learn to speak in an American accent. The scene in which his dialect coach tries to get him to say, "I would like to buy a hamburger," couldn't have lasted more than two minutes. So then why did it seem to go on much longer than that? It was enough to make me wish that the entire subplot had been eliminated from the film altogether. It goes absolutely nowhere. And it simply wasn't funny.<br /><br />Another idea that failed to capture my interest involved Dreyfus' secretary, Nicole (Emily Mortimer). It was clear that the filmmakers were trying to show a love interest between her and Clouseau. Some tender moments are shared, but they were too few to warrant serious consideration. It didn't help that Nicole was merely a notch below Clouseau in terms of her display of physical humor. It only goes to show that in comedies such as these, opposite attractions are more interesting than two people who are made for each other.<br /><br />I'm not sure how this happened, but a cameo by Clive Owen as a James Bond knockoff managed to work its way into the film. He plays Agent 006, a suave secret agent hired to hunt down a bandit group that disables their victims with gas bombs. Why they included this character or this subplot, I have no idea; they added nothing to the story, nor did they play big enough parts to leave me satisfied with their inclusion. I really don't think that expanding this idea would have helped the film; like the nonexistent chemistry between Martin and Reno, Owen's role seemed to belong in a different film. I suppose a James Bond spoof would be a lot of fun to watch (films like "Spy Hard"), but it shouldn't push its way into someone else's movie.<br /><br />This 2006 version of "The Pink Panther" came off the same way that most of the original version's sequels did: lackluster and comically over the top (in a bad way). I seriously doubt if this remake will garner any sequels. But if it somehow manages to, then the filmmakers need to pay close attention to the script (it was almost shocking to see in the opening credits that Steve Martin had partially written this film). They also need to choose their director wisely. Not even a cleverly animated opening title sequence (virtually identical in style to those of the original films) can gloss over the disappointing job Levy did. But I think the most important thing they need to do is redefine their definition of an entertaining comedy. Maybe then films like this won't get made.</p></body></html>

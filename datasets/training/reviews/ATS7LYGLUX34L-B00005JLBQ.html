<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie, Better Book."></head><body><p>I read the Graphic Novel Road to Perdition by Max Allen Collins and Richard Piers Rayner when it was released by DC Comics' Paradox Press imprint years ago. To say I was blown away would be an understatement. This was one of the finest works of literature I have ever encountered. In any medium. PERIOD. It really distressed me that Collins and Rayner weren't getting money and awards heaped on them. No one seemed to have read it but me! Well, I guess it doesn't matter how many people read it after all, because apparently the RIGHT people read it, since it's now a big summer movie.<p>  Road to Perdition tells the story of Michael Sullivan, a mob button-man in prohibition-era Chicago, forced to go on the run with his young son, after the son sees Sullivan and Connor Rooney, the son of a powerful Mob-Boss (Wonderfully played  by the great Paul Newman, who will probably get an Oscar for his part), carrying out a mission that goes horribly wrong, due to the trigger-happy Conner.  The book and movie echo the classic Japanese Manga Lone Wolf and Cub, as father and son face incredible odds, leading to a fateful climax that will decide the boy's future. Jude Law is excellent as the Homicidal crime-scene photographer sent after the Sullivans, and Stanley Tucci does his usual great job as Frank Nitti. It's too bad that Anthony LaPaglia's Al Capone was left on the cutting room floor, as Capone's presence loomed large in the book. <p>  The adaptation, by David Self, veers WAAY off from the source material; The movie is much "Smaller" than the book, and omits the Capone Hotel massacre, the riverboat heist/fire, and changes the fate of young Michael to a more bland one. Overall, it's a very good movie, but as usual, the book was better. I can't urge you strongly enough to read Road to Perdition, published by Paradox Press; If you like the movie, you'll fall in love with the book.</p></body></html>

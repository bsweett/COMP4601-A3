The first PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movie introduced Johnny Depp to a much, much wider audience; as Captain Jack Sparrow, he was a wonder, cracking wise and kicking butt (often at the same time).  CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL remains a family-friendly action/adventure classic.  It's sequels...eh.<br /><br />ON STRANGER TIDES makes no sense.  Okay?  Should this surprise you...you're in the wrong genre, my friend.  It's big and bold (though not nearly as much as its two predecessors, thank God), features some mediocre acting (Depp and Geoffrey Rush remain strong, and Ian McShane is fantastic even though his character is crudely drawn), a few genuine laughs, a few false laughs, a few failed bits of choreography, and a whole lot of fun.  Maybe not as much fun as back at the beginning, when all of this was new, but you'll still enjoy yourself...probably.<br /><br />The plot?  Something to do with Blackbeard (McShane), his daughter (Penelope Cruz; finally, a strong female character, or at least a strong female actress); Captain Barbosa (Rush) as a British emissary; a shirtless priest who falls in love with a mermaid (you think I'm joking, but I'm not); the fountain of youth; and a bunch of good pirates and evil British guys.  Oh, and Keith Richards.  Rock on.<br /><br />If I sound sarcastic, it's because you just can't take this movie seriously, not even on its own terms.  But trust me: ON STRANGER TIDES is, at the very least, a fun movie (note the three stars).  Jack Sparrow is getting rather tired (I would much rather watch the first film on repeat), but Depp still has enough charisma to breathe a little bit more life into him.  If nothing else, the visuals remain spectacular, the plot interesting enough for us to forgive the fact that it is so full of holes an elephant could waltz right through it, and the pirates still delightfully funny (I'd love to see the "realistic" version of this film...well, maybe not).  It could stand to be a little darker and scarier (the mermaid premise, as awful as it originally comes across, actually had some promise), but we're willing to settle for what it is.  And that, at least, is worth a viewing or two.</p></body></html>

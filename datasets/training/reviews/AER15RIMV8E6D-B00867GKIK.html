When Carl is a young boy, he meets a new friend named Ellie and find that they both love adventure. They get married and spend their lives together. When Ellie passes away, Carl becomes depressed and forgets about his old promise to Ellie about visiting Paradise Falls in South America. Carl is soon visited by a little boy named Russell, who is trying to get his "Assisting the Elderly" badge. Carl soon turns his house into an airship using thousands of balloons. He finds out that Russell was still on his house and assists him in his adventures. Carl runs into his boyhood hero, who actually turns out to be his enemy. With the help of Russell and Dug, the lovable talking dog, Carl tries to save a female bird named Kevin by any means necessary. I highly recommend that you go UP!!!</p></body></html>

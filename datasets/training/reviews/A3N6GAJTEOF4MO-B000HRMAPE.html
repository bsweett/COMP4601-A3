<meta name="summary" content="J.J. Abrams + Tom Cruise + Philip Seymour Hoffman = Action Movie Masterpiece"></head><body><p>When this film was first announced it was met with skepticism and with the constant bad press Tom Cruise had received over the months this movie was destined to fail. That was before we had the chance to see this stellar combination in action; Tom Cruise reprising his role as Ethan Hunt and Philip Seymour Hoffman taking the role as the main bad guy, arms dealer Owen Davian. These two great actors combined together with the unique and talented Directional mind of J.J. Abrams this movie shut all the skeptics up and gave us an action movie that would truly wrap up the Ethan Hunt saga.<br /><br />Tom Cruise in this movie I think really excels and this is somewhat of a film that really pushed his acting ability to which he delivered perfectly. Philip Hoffman was the true shining light of this film as he played the sick and sadistic arms dealer who was willing to go to any lengths to have Hunt destroyed, even if it meant murdering his girlfriend in the process.<br /><br />This is a great movie and I thought this was truly the right time to re-ignite an old franchise, if you haven't seen this yet and have been one of the skeptics I challenge you to hate this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Finale To The "Next Generation" Movie Series."></head><body><p>After the vast disappointment Paramount gave us with "Insurrection" (one of the worst of the series), they make up for that loss with #10 in the long-running series of, in my opinion, the best sci-fi movie series ever.  The plot is pretty imaginative, all except for the clone part, which seems pretty run-of-the-mill sci-fi stuff after "Episode II" and the "Austin Powers" movies.  But, the plot simply wouldn't be as good, or work as well, without it, and it is handled very well.  The plot is, however, at times somewhat confusing and underplayed, but not much.  And one can easily spot some similarities between this and other previous Trek films; "The Wrath of Khan" most of all, as well as "The Undiscovered Country", and even a dab or two of "The Search For Spock".  But these aside, it's a highly enjoyable movie, and makes a worthy end to the big screen voyages of Picard n' crew.  The whole Enterprise (which, by the way, looks better than ever) crew is in top form, of course.  The guy who plays Shinzon gives a highly entertaining, and different, performance.  While not trying to be as menacing as a Klingon or Khan, he gives a stand-out performance as the "Nemesis" of the title (and he really does look like a younger Patrick Stewart).  The ending is exciting and tense; yet, there is a sense of sadness as well (especially ********* to ruin it would be futile), but also of hope...........as with "The Undiscovered Country", which was the last voyage of the original Enterprise crew.<p>"Star Trek: Nemesis" is well-worth seeing on the big screen, and is certainly tied with "First Contact" as the best of the Next Generation film series.  Well worth the 4-year wait!<p>(Now I wonder if they'll make a film series of "Deep Space Nine", which I think would be interesting to see;  I haven't seen more than one full episode of that series, but what I remember of it was really boring.  but it had a great theme!  And after that, maybe films of "Voyager"?  "Enterprise"?)</p></body></html>

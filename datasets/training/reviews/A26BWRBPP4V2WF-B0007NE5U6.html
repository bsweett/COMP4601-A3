<meta name="summary" content="Mildly amusing, but ultimately pointless sequel"></head><body><p>The first Bridget Jones movie was a perfect little human comedy.  Although absurdly unlucky, Bridget remained a consistent and logical (in her own way) centre to the film.  The humour grew organically from her "logical" reactions to the absurdity happening around her.  And we had a nice, romantic happy ending.  The same praise cannot be given to this sequel, "Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason."  Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed the film in a superficial way, at least while I was watching it.  Unfortunately, it's entirely unecessary, except as a money-making grab by the studio.<br /><br />The plot: Mark Darcy is seen in the presence of another woman.  Bridget assumes he is cheating on her and is then assigned a job in Thailand with Daniel Cleaver (the "ex").  Therein lies the main problem I had with the film: the entire story is built on misunderstandings that could be cleared up with the tiniest application of logic on any one of the characters' parts.  Similarly, actions are not driven by the nature of the characters, but rather the requirements of the plot.  For example, almost immediately after starting the relationship with Mark Darcy, Bridget's friends are advising her to dump him.  Why?  I have no idea - I guess because the screenplay told them to!  Similarly, if Bridget is thrown in a Thai jail while on assignment for her TV network, wouldn't someone at that network notice that she had gone missing?<br /><br />Am I applying logic where none is required?  Probably.  But a sequel should be able to build on the characters rather than making them more two-dimensional (or making their actions arbitrary).  I should be asking is the film funny?  Are the actors good?  The answer to both questions is undeniably "yes!"  I applaud the idea of building a comedy around the question, "what happens after happily ever after?" Unfortunately, the film bails and gives us a series of silly little scenes that work on their own, but never add up to anything worthwhile.<br /><br />On the plus side, Mirimax has deigned to give us at least a few extras on the DVD.  There are some deleted scenes, the most welcome being the infamous "Bridget interviews Colin Firth" scene from the novel.  Obviously, it became impossible to put this in the movie with Firth playing Mark Darcy, but they filmed it anyway at the end of a day's shooting and stuck it on the DVD as a treat to those who have read the book.  There are also some scene breakdowns and a director's commentary.</p></body></html>

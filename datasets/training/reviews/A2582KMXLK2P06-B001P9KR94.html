<meta name="summary" content="shockingly good"></head><body><p>First of all, the VERY first thing I need to say is this-<br /><br />Do NOT let the previews you've seen of Slumdog Millionaire fool you- this movie is much more than just a contestant appearing on a gameshow, winning money, and winning back his girlfriend for a happy conclusion.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire is about MUCH more than that.<br /><br />It's about the contestant winning money on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire (the Mumbai version, which is the name of a city in India), but the storyline is more about how the contestant even GOT the opportunity to appear on the show, and the life long build-up of the contestants tragic and horrible past.<br /><br />It's a story that focuses on the contestants past, and the way he had to grow up in a poor, dangerous and just unsettling and unhealthy environment. He had to go through life basically looking out for himself, along with his small group of friends, just to survive.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, every time the contestant is about to answer a question on the gameshow, the story switches to something that happened in his past that enabled him to remember the answer to the questions he was being asked. Eventually there comes a point when the contestant answers so many questions correctly that he gets accused of cheating which leads to a little bit of violence.<br /><br />It might sound a bit tacky, and maybe to some it is tacky, but to me, it was a story told exceptionally well, and I highly recommend this movie. What will happen to the contestants group of friends as they grow up and grow apart? Well, you have to see it to believe it. I was totally attached to Slumdog Millionaire the entire time and I can NOW see why the film received so many awards. The presentation is just amazing.<br /><br />Great story, lots of tragic events and suspense, and just fantastic acting all around. Yup, it's one of those rare movies that does everything right.</p></body></html>

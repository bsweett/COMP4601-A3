Demme won the Oscar for directing "Silence of the Lambs" in 1991.  I enjoyed watching the DVD extra interviews with him, only wondering why he didn't use a razor.  :)<br /><br />There is no doubt that with two Oscars for "Kramer vs. Kramer" in 1979, "Sophie's Choice" in 1982 & numerous other nominations, Meryl Streep is one of the most acclaimed actresses of our time.  However, it was this film for which she was nominated by the British Academy Awards & the Golden Globes that really made me a Streep fan.  To watch her glide through Eleanor Shaw with elegance, polish and the cold-blooded instincts for political survival was incredible.  The scene where she's wearing purple sunglasses and swirls around lecturing the other Manchurian Global bigshots was breathtaking.<br /><br />Liev Schreiber who I recently enjoyed in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NOIX48">The Painted Veil</a> does an excellent job as Congressman Raymond Shaw.  Schreiber has been nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actor in a TV movie or miniseries for "RKO 281."  As Shaw, he does a masterful job of playing the polished politician with perhaps too strong ties to his mother's apron strings.<br /><br />That said, Denzel Washington turns in another blockbuster performance as Maj. Bennett Marco.  Washington has two Oscars for "Glory" in 1989 & "Training Day" in 2001.  The levels he achieves -- from the stable military commander to the unstable programmed assassin to a confused man trying to figure out a puzzle -- result in a varied & excellent performance.  Demme particularly complimented Washington on the scene where Marco tells Shaw that there is a strong bond between the two of them.<br /><br />Jon Voight who won his Best Actor Oscar for "Coming Home" in 1978 as a stressed out veteran does a good job here as Sen. Thomas Jordan who gets squeezed out of a vice presidential nomination.  Vera Farmiga who I'm enjoying in the DVD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001840TU8">Never Forever</a> and who played in "The Departed" performs well in the cameo appearance as Jocelyn Jordan, the daughter of Sen. Shaw and the past romantic interest of Raymond Shaw.  Her demise is as strangely beautiful as it is violent.  Kimberly Elise who was in "The Great Debators" plays Rosie with depth, the F.B.I. agent who becomes sympathetic to Washington's Bennett Marco.  Jeffrey Wright who has recently played in "Casino Royale" as well as the new James Bond film "Quantum of Solace" does a masterful job as the unstable Al Melvin who is haunted by his dreams, writes them down in a journal and scribbles disturbing drawings on the wall of his flat.<br /><br />Demme keeps the pace moving, the intrigue breathtaking up to the final shots in the film.  This was a great picture whose performances make it worth viewing.  I also found the issues of just how much control the people actually have in a democracy when those elected constantly try to control the outcome to be relevant to present day.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Highly entertaining film of revenge and murder"></head><body><p>This is a highly entertaining film that is well written and directed. I have to admit that I never got ahead of the plot's final ironies which are surprising twists of fate. It is the story of a family of four boys reared by an adopted mother willing to take in rough homeless kids from rough families. Mark Wahlberg is excellent as Bobby Mercer along with his three other adopted brothers played by Andre Benjamin, Garret Hedlund, and Tyrese Gibson. The fact that two of these fellows were white and two were black worked very well in this film where affiliation lines were drawn over many differences and similarities. The family arguments and struggles are very realistic and show how brothers struggle with each other, no matter what race they may be. The brothers are each distinct and unique giving the film further depth. The highest praise I can give is that the bonds between the brothers felt authentic. The city of Detroit is highly visible in the film. After the death of their adopted mother Evelyn, these fellows begin to discover that there may have been more than random crime at work in her death. Terrence Howard is superb as a childhood friend who has become a police officer and is willing to give the brothers some inside information. The puzzle of their mother's death begins to point to a hateful local mobster played perfectly by Chiwetel Ejiofor. The scene where this mobster makes one of his hit men and the hit man's wife eats French fries off the floor like dogs is priceless. It may sound predictable but the action is fast and dramatic, the plot has many twists, and the ending was one of the most emotionally satisfying that I have seen in a long time. It is a violent film, highly suspenseful, based on revenge and murder, but non-the-less it is highly entertaining.</p></body></html>

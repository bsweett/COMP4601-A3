<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Movies of All Time!"></head><body><p>This movie is absolute perfection. Humphrey Bogart (my favorite actor) and Ingrid Bergman make screen magic in this movie, Claude Rains is also superb. Filled with lots of now famous cliches; 'Here's looking at you  kid', 'This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship', 'We'll always have  Paris', 'Play it Sam, play As Time Goes By', etc. This is THE Hollywood  movie, probably the greatest screenplay ever written, filled with memorable  dialogue. Easily one of the greatest movies of all time, a MUST SEE. From a  scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 10!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="How do you control Michael Myers?"></head><body><p>It's been a little while since our last entry but that doesn't mean we haven't been hard at work watching b. We hit a rough patch for about a month or so but now we are back in full force. For our comeback why not go with a heavy dose of Dr. Loomis? Which brings us to our title feature of the evening Halloween 2. Released in 1981, 3 years after the original masterpiece, Halloween 2 picks up where the first one left off as Myers is being pursued by the mighty Loomis and Haddonfield Police department.<br /><br />After Myers killing spree that Halloween evening he is on the run after being laced up by Loomis about 9 times. Naturally the bullets do nothing but inspire him to continue in his quest to murder Laurie. As he takes to the streets Loomis and the police chief cruise around looking for him where the first moment of hilarity occurs. These two see someone dressed up like Myers and assume it's him forcing them to chase him down with guns. As the suspected Myers takes off he gets wedged in between to moving cars forcing an explosion, which then leads to him being burned alive. When you get a brief shot of the victim on fire it is so obvious it's a dummy which just adds to the delight of the film. Talk about entertaining! Later at the lab they discover the burn victim wasn't myers but a regular kid doing some trick or treating. Now they realize they wasted all this time thinking they got him when really he's on his way to the Haddonfield hospital to finish Laurie off. Instinctively Loomis knows where Myers will be headed off to and makes his way to the hospital.<br /><br />Once in the hospital we are introduced to the human version of Quagmire which leads to many many laughs throughout the film. This guy is a nurse and seems his sole purpose is to get laid. Being the smooth operator he is he hides under a sheet pretending to be a dead body. Once his woman walks in the door he jumps up nearly giving her a heart attack. Yeah this guy has it coming. He finally talks he into a nude hot tube romp only to get choked out by Myers and his lady drowned. After this there is a lot of cat and mouse between Myers and Laurie. There were a few tense scenes and the hospital did provide a creepy atmosphere, but it wasn't quite a scary as we remembered it to be long ago. The best part came in the end when Laurie is cornered by Myers until Loomis comes to the rescue. He does enough to distract Myers while Laurie turns on some gas valves and shoots Myers in the face. Somehow he only acts like he has some dirt stuck in his eye and aimlessley swings his blade in the air trying to strike Laurie as she runs right past him. Loomis then gets his attention and ignites the gas fumes with his lighter blasting a wing of the hospital to shreds. Naturally Myers comes walking ot on fire but does eventually fall to the ground while Mr. Sandman plays.<br /><br />All in all it was pretty decent for a sequal but nowhere near the original. On it's own it would stand as a good flick so don't bother comparing the two. The scares really weren't there but the laughs sure were. This was some vintage Loomis that any Halloween fan can appreciate. Definately worth the watch but could use a little assistance (oh yeah) to gain a 5 star effort.</p></body></html>

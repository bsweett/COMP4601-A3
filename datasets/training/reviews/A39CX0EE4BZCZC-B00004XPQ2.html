<meta name="summary" content="Good Then, Still Good Now"></head><body><p>This famous film is long (161 minutes), is over 50 years old, and yet still is terrific, still holds up and will forever, I suspect, be considered one of the greatest war movies ever made.<br /><br />'Kwai' is particularly amazing in that there is very little action in it, yet it consistently entertains. It's as good now as when I saw in the theater as a 12-year-old.  I say this to encourage younger people to check this classic-era film out, and give it a chance.<br /><br />Anyone who is fascinated with character studies also might find this of particular interest regarding Alec Guiness' role in here as "Colonel Nicholson." He was mesmerizing in his role. William Holden, Sessue Hayakawan, Jack Hawkins and the rest of the cast are all excellent, with the four mentioned above perhaps playing the roles of their lives.<br /><br />The gorgeous countryside of Ceylon is photographed beautifully. David Lean, one of the all-time great directors, did this film, too, so it certainly has good credentials. A winner of seven Oscars, this great movie has stood the test of time.</p></body></html>

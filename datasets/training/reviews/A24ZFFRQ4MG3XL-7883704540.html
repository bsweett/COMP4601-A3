<meta name="summary" content="Excellent and hillarious :-P"></head><body><p>I saw this a couple of months ago in the States and was blown away.  I had wanted to see this ever since publicity started up for it on shows like ET or The Insider.  I wasn't disappointed.  It was everything I thought it would be and more.  Side splitting in parts and brilliant 'animation'.  Now that it has FINALLY got to Australia (months and months later) I am heading off to see it again because it's so good.<br />The story line keeps you engaged the whole time even though the thought of rats in a kitchen may not seem appealing or appetising.  It's set in Paris and the scenery is very realistic and beautiful.<br />Remy is well voiced by Payton Oswalt (King of Queens and Reno 911) and I thought Django was done brilliantly by Brian Dennehy.  Remy comes to Paris from the French countryside to find his cooking idol is dead.  He makes friends with a restaurants garbage boy and so the fun begins.  Overall this is such a cute, adorable and cleverly written movie that will have you laughing your head off and keep you very well entertained.  I really love this and can't wait to see it again and get it on dvd.</p></body></html>

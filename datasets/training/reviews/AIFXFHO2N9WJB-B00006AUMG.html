<meta name="summary" content="The War Between Blade and Vampires Continues..."></head><body><p>Since movie audiences made "Blade" a big success, it's no surprise that New Line Cinema would put writer David S. Goyer ("The Crow: City of Angels" and "Blade") hard at work on crafting the sequel.  The key to a successful movie franchise is to try to keep most of the key players throughout, meaning the same actors for the same roles, so after getting David S. Goyer back to write the sequel, New Line pursued both Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson to return to the roles of Blade and Whistler.  Once these tasks were accomplished and the script was written, and director Guillermo Del Toro ("Mimic") was tapped to helm the film, everything was set for the cameras to roll for "Blade 2".<br /><br />Picking up a year or two after the first film, "Blade 2" puts Blade (Wesley Snipes) hot on the tail of some vampires who are hiding Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) somewhere, and keeping him alive as a vampire.  After freeing his mentor, Blade is confronted by an elite group of vampires known as the Bloodpack.  The Bloodpack informs Blade that a new enemy of vampires has emerged, but this new enemy called Reapers, are not solely after vampires, they hunt humans as well.  To stop the Reapers, Blade must join forces with his most hated enemies or let humanity be destroyed.<br /><br />"Blade 2" basically takes everything that was great about the first film, and improves upon it.  With the directing of Guillermo Del Toro and the terrific writing of David S. Goyer, the saga of Blade continues forward at break-neck speed.  Outstanding special effects that blow the first film away, and show a tremendous amount of imagination, "Blade 2" is a visual extravaganza.  Rarely does a sequel top its predecessor, but "Blade 2" succeeds in being the exception to the rule.  If you enjoyed "Blade", you will most definitely love "Blade 2", and just like "Blade", the ending leaves you just wanting more.<br /><br />"Blade 2" is rated R for violence and language.</p></body></html>

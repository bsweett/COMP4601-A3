<meta name="summary" content="Deadly Apparel"></head><body><p>Based on Gustav Hasford's novel The Short-Timers and directed by Stanley Kubrick who co-authored the screenplay, this film answers two questions: What was it like for a recruit to go through Marine boot camp during the Viet Nam War, and, what was combat like in that war? Unlike a previous Kubrick film, Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket neither makes nor implies any anti-war statements. Rather, in my opinion, the two separate but related portrayals "tell it like it was." When I first saw this film 25 years ago, my reactions resembled those of Private Benjamin during her own boot camp training: shock and denial. Having never served in a military service, I simply could not believe that Marine recruits are subjected to such abuse, both physical and verbal. One of my sons served in the Marines and confirms what other Marines of my own generation assert, that Full Metal Jacket is about as realistic as a film could be. Older friends who were involved in D-Day make the same claim for Saving Private Ryan. <p>In any event, the primary plot during the boot camp sequence focuses on Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), nicknamed "Gomer Pyle," and his struggles to survive constant humiliation by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey, a former Marine D.I.) Played by Matthew Modine, J.T. Davis ("Joker") does everything humanly possible to help him. Months later while on an assignment for Stars &amp; Stripes magazine,  "Joker" accompanies a squad in the Khe San area. Once under attack by a Viet Cong sniper, most of the Marines react according to their boot camp training. Of special interest to me is the character Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin) who has become a highly-skilled (probably psychotic) warrior. He defies authority with the instincts of a ferocious animal but, at the same time, reveals a sincere and endearing concern for the welfare of his comrades. It remains for each person who sees this film to determine to what extent (if any) it is "anti-" anything. And perhaps at least a few will share my own initial reaction: Full Metal Jacket consists of two separate but inseparable films which share the same title. Together, they have enduring dramatic impact.</p></body></html>

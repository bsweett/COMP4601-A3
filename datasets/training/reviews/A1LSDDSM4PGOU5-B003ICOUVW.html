<meta name="summary" content="unrated extended edition"></head><body><p>i thought this was a pretty good movie.it's bit predictable at times.but it's also fun.Benecio Del Toro really impressed with a flawless American accent.i could have done with someone else playing Hugo weaving's character.though.here,he just reminded me of his Agent Smith character in the Matrix series.by that i mean the same tone of voice,the same cadence and inflection,that sort of thing.maybe that's how Weaving always speaks,but it's just distracting for me.one thing about this movie:it's very graphically violent.the transformation scenes were well done,in my opinion as were the special makeup effects.it may be a remake of the 1941 original,but there some difference,if i recall correctly.anyway,i'm not gonna compare the two movies with each other,although i know i did also like the original.as for The Wolfman (2010),for me,it's a 4/5</p></body></html>

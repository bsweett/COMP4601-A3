<meta name="summary" content="From Civil War to Civil War"></head><body><p>Near the end of the U.S. Civil War, a Confederate gold-laden ironclad departs Richmond, Virginia under bombardment and steams into the fog of history.<br /><br />In the present, two oceanographers, named Dirk and Al, obsess about finding her.  Following the recovery of an ancient African artifact off the coast of Nigeria, they find a clue that points to the country of Mali.  At the same time, a World Health Organization doctor, named Eva, suspects the source of a potential plague is in Mali.  Together, they motor up river to Mali where their destinies will intertwine.  Unfortunately, the forces of Mali's Warlord General and the Tuareg fighters are engaged in a Civil War.<br /><br />The most fun scene is a deleted scene:  'The Long Kiss'.  Watch Al's discomfort as Dirk and Eva are in a major lip-lock.<br /><br />Extras:<br />COMMENTARIES BY DIRECTOR EISNER & ACTOR/EXECUTIVE PRODUCER McCONAUGHEY<br />ACROSS THE SANDS OF SAHARA:  Primarily, McConaughey, Zahn, and Cruz talk about their roles.<br />VISUALIZING SAHARA:  Primarily, the look of, the costumes of, and the making of 'Sahara'.<br />CAST AND CREW WRAP FILM:  A series of fast cuts of behind the scenes and personal silly moments.<br />DELETED SCENES:  'Kitty Mannock's Crash',  'Finding Kitty Mannock's Plane',  'The Long Kiss',  'Oceanographers Dying in the Desert'.<br />CAMEL CHASE:  The making of the chase scene with the train.<br />ANIMATICS - OPENING SCENE:  Storyboard sequence of the ironclad leaving Richmond.<br />ANIMATICS - TRAIN JUMP:  Storyboard sequence of a train bound for the solar mirror farm.<br />STORYBOARD COMPARISONS:  'Gun Fight at the Well',  'Finding the Ironclad',  'Dirk Rescues Eva on the Beach'.<br />THEATRICAL TRAILER<br />PREVIEWS:  Only a plug for Paramount High Definition capabilities.<br /><br />Picture (Blu-ray): outstanding (5).

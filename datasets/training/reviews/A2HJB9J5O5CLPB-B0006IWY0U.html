<meta name="summary" content="Shiver Me Timbers"></head><body><p>Shiver me timbers, boy. Har har. The trouble with these old sea tales is the lack of women. Its all about the men and boys for years, er and hour or so. Here's an excellent recreation of life at sea on wooden ships. Are the action scenes exciting or farfetched? As a yarn I guess its okay, but a little too Hollywood for my taste. Russel Crowe is certainly everybody's favorite captain or little league coach. His doctor pal is unreasonable and not much of a friend in his single minded Darwinian search for lizards and bugs while the British Empire is in danger. Anyhow, entertaining, but nothing to write home about.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="violent, ugly film, just so disappointing"></head><body><p>This was pushed as THE film of the year. Since I love history, and this is based on historical fact, and it was loaded with a powerhouse cast, I thought wow...<br />Then I saw it and I said wow...but with a different inflection. <p>This film was brutal, an ugly film that was an exercise in wallowing in violence with nothing to redeem the film. Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio are miscast, completely. Diaz's role seems so unclear, like they said hey, let's stick Diaz in here for star power. DiCaprio, usually a very talented actor, looks like a little boy trying to play big boy and worse, his performance was so dull as if we walked through the whole film. At time, his efforts are near comical. Daniel Day-Lewis turned in a stunning performance, but nearly stomach churning at times. Liam Neeson, another fine actor is there for a thankless near cameo role.<p>Sorry, for the money that went into this film, it's such a disappointment.</p></body></html>

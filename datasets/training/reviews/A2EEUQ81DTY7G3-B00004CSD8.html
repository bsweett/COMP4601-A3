<meta name="summary" content=""The darkest evil this way comes""></head><body><p>Although one wonders why it even needed to be made in the first place - let's face it the original 1976 horror classic wasn't that good in the first place - this slick and haunting remake does the job quite well, and in many respects is even better than its predecessor. This stylistic remake is certainly one of the better films about hellfire and brimstone and devilish possession to be released in recent years.<br /><br />The antichrist has finally been born in the form of a deceptively cherubic little boy, who brings Armageddon to the home of a powerful and respected U.S. ambassador Robert Thorne (a brooding Liev Schreiber).  His wife Kate (Julia Stiles) doesn't know that the babies were swapped at birth, and that her real child has died and she must never know his secret.<br /><br />They name the child Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) and shower him with love. Life is wonderful, Thorn is appointed American ambassador to Great Britain, and the couple moves to a beautiful estate near London, with their healthy son, and a golden political future. But of course Damien no ordinary boy. His real mother is in fact a jackal.<br /><br />On his sixth birthday those around Damien start to die. His first nanny hangs herself. Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite) repeatedly tries to warn Mr. Thorn of his family's fate, but Thorn just doesn't want to listen. A sinister and snarling dog appears to act as an unwanted watchdog over the child and gorillas in the zoo shriek and run from Damien in terror.<br /><br />Suddenly, the sweet and soft-spoken Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow) arrives but she's really a deceptively evil nanny from hell, sent to protect the child. And a photographer (David Thewlis) discovers bizarre markings in his photos that threaten death for the Thorns unless Damien is destroyed. It all gets creepier and scarier and the Thorns' slowly realize who and what their son is.<br /><br />Restraint seems to be the order of the day here, as director John Moore builds the action and atmosphere steadily. Both Stiles and Schreiber give beautifully understated performances and the lovely Ms. Farrow - all concentrated eyes and disturbing smiles - brings the needed prestige to the film.<br /><br />Filmed in Prague, The Omen has the creepy look that one should expect from this genre and the gorgeous cinematography juxtaposes the cold daylight of reality with the hidden dangers in seemingly ordinary people. Remakes don't usually live up to originals, but in this case The Omen looks sharper and plays classier than the first film, and is a quite enthralling, inventive and ultimately bone-chillingly gratifying.

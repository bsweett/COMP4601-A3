But why do people get upset if the movie doesn't<br /><br />play out like the book? If it was going to be just like<br /><br />the book there would be little point in even making it<br /><br />a movie.<br /><br />I thought the movies was abit of the mixed bag... I<br /><br />thought Brad Pitt was average at best... I really<br /><br />think they could have got someone else for the role<br /><br />and came better off. He came off pretty well in the<br /><br />fight scenes, but otherwise he was unconvincing to<br /><br />me as a tough cold hearted sword fighter.<br /><br />Another problem was Blooms character... He was simply<br /><br />way to weak and looked to young. I would have a hard<br /><br />time understanding how a woman would love can compassion<br /><br />for such a weakling.<br /><br />Otherwise I think the film had good acting... The guy<br /><br />that played as Hector really took the show in this one.<br /><br />He was convincing as a good fighter, but at the same<br /><br />time down to earth and beatable. The movie showing<br /><br />Achillies to be so unbeatable kind of hurt Hector<br /><br />and it's ashame... I believe it took alittle sting<br /><br />out of the Achillies/Hector show down.<br /><br />Also, I think the movie should have put more effort<br /><br />into the fall of Troy instead of so much attention<br /><br />on Achilles. The fall of Troy was simply way to<br /><br />secondary when it should have got a better role in<br /><br />the film.<br /><br />This film was very much worth renting... But it falls<br /><br />short of a great movie like Gladiator.</p></body></html>

While he is still a very active filmmaker his past films have been being remade with more to come I am sure. One of those films is "The Crazies" a remake that he actually supported and came on board as an executive producer. I always have hope for a remake when the original creator is involved or signs off on it, from the films of his that have been remade this ranks as one of the best. Still the film is not perfect and falls short of classic status, not to say it is not a good movie, it is.<br /><br />We find ourselves in a small American town in Iowa I believe following the life of the town sheriff David Dutten and our day is starting off wrong. During a baseball game that the whole town seems to be at a man looking he is drunk, but something is off, not to mention he I wielding a shotgun. When Sheriff Dutten confronts him the man raises the gun and forces the Sheriff to shoot  him, killing him in the process. This is just the first of many strange things happening in the town, things like the town drunk. People start to act really weird with homicidal tendencies and such, like a farmer wanting to bun his family alive. Just when things seem like the can't be any worse then your neighbors wanting to kill you the government steps in to quarantine the town. Just like them to make your day worse or at least in the film, if it was me I am not sure, I guess they were doing the right thing for the rest of the world.<br /><br />Director Breck Eisner does a good job of moving things along and really does not make more out of what the film is, a good survival flick. The film follows the Sheriff, his wife, his deputy, and a few others, basically your core group of bodies to kill off one by one. But even your simple group of people need to make it here by this time to survive film can be fun with good acting. This is were the film is strongest for the most part, our lead in Sheriff Dutten is played by Timothy Olyphant. He does a good job in this film making it very believable as does Radha Mitchell playing his wife. Now to make it short I will say every one in this film did a good job and was very believable, but it was Joe Anderson that was the show stealer. Joe played the deputy in this film and in my opinion gave the best performance, and the most fun.<br /><br />Speaking of fun you know I love the gore and such in this film, always fun to see blood pouring out every where in a good flick. Also I must say that if you are expecting a zombie movie you will be disappointed. Although these people are similar to the undead they are still very much alive, they are just infected. It seems something leaked into the water and is causing people to resort to animal like behavior, wanting to eat and kill. So just know from the jump these people are infected and undead, zombie like but not a zombie night.<br /><br />The great DVD release features some fun behind the scenes and making of features, including a look at Mr. Romero, also there is a great audio commentary.</p></body></html>

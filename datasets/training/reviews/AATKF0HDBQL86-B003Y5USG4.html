<meta name="summary" content="Disaster films can't get any better than this!"></head><body><p>I remember seeing this film in the theater when it first came out, and I was totally blown away.  Twister ranks among the best of the disaster films that I have ever seen.  Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt turn in stellar performances as Jo and Bill, an estranged couple who are in the process of a divorce when they are suddenly thrown back together in pursuit of the most violent series of tornadoes to hit mid-America in 50 years.  In working together both are forced to confront some of their own inner demons, especially the ones that drove them apart in the first place.<p>Of course, no movie is any good without a strong supporting cast, and Twister has that in spades.  From Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dusty on down to Lois Smith as Jo's Aunt Meg, these actors do a heck of a lot more than serve as backdrop to Jo and Bill.  They help to enhance the story, each in their own way.<p>What I liked best about Twister was the fact that I found it to be a very intellectual film, much like The Day After.  Although to some it may seem to be mostly a Jo and Bill story on the surface, I found myself doing a lot of &quot;what if&quot; thinking in regards to any disaster, natural OR manmade, after seeing it.  I couldn't help but ask myself just how I'd react in the face of oncoming disaster, what steps I'd take to avoid getting myself or others hurt or killed, things like that.  This, I believe, is a key ingredient in any successful disaster film--the ability to make you think about how'd you react under the very same circumstances.<p>All in all, I consider Twister to be among the most superior disaster films ever made.  Loaded with awesome acting, superb special effects, and a great story, this is a film that is definitely worth owning!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Deliciously diabolical!"></head><body><p>In a summer movie season where there are at least nine or ten mindless sequels (six of them are PART III's!) being shoved down our throats, MR. BROOKS is a refreshing dosage of original thrills, surprises, twists and good solid acting from Kevin Costner and William Hurt (Brook's evil alter-ego).  Hell, I even enjoyed Demi Moore's performance as the wealthy detective.<br /><br />The only flaw in the story (spoiler), in my opinion, is the suggestion that Earle Brooks's daughter may have contracted her father's "addiction" to killing people.  Very far-fetched and over the top for me.  Beyond that, this movie was a rare good reason to even bother going to the movies this summer.</p></body></html>

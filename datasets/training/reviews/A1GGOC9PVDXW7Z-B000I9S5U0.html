<meta name="summary" content="Jim Braddock: "I have to believe that when things are bad I can change them.""></head><body><p>Ron Howard is a great director (love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226810">FAR AND AWAY</a>!), but he's no brainiac when it comes to keeping facts straight. On his commentary track for CINDERELLA MAN, an often fictional bio of heavyweight champ Jim Braddock, Howard ID's an Eddie Cantor song as being by Eddie Fisher and claims that Max Baer killed two men in the ring.<br /><br />That's not true.<br /><br />One, Frankie Campbell, took a terrible beating from Max and died the next day in a hospital. Max was charged with manslaughter and acquitted. The second that Howard must be referring to is Ernie Schaaf. In their rematch, Baer beat the tar out of Schaaf, who suffered from bad headaches after this bout. He died five months later from a Primo Carnera left jab. Baer's previous thrashing may have set up the tragedy, but he didn't kill Ernie Schaaf in the ring.<br /><br />.<br />This distortion of fact is apparent in Howard's film as well. Baer's prominent Star of David has been excised from his boxing trunks, and as original footage of their 6/13/35 belt battle shows, Baer never cup-punched Braddock, never slapped him in the face, and never turned to answer Jimmy's manager and caught two sucker punches from Braddock.<br /><br />As entertainment, it works, and very well. The ring sequences are skillfully assembled, Crowe is believable as a boxer, costars Zellweger and Giamatti are both excellent and the recreation of Depression Era mid-1930s is spot-on, but for anyone with knowledge of the actual Braddock/Baer fight, this movie can get a little annoying in that last crucial sequence. Still worth seeing.<br /><br />.<br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.0) Cinderella Man (2005) - Russell Crowe/Ren&eacute;e Zellweger/Paul Giamatti/Craig Bierko/Bruce McGill/Rance Howard/Clint Howard/Angelo Dundee</p></body></html>

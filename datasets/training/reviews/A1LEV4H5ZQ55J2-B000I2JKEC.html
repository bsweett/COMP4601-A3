<meta name="summary" content="FINDING AN ACTOR TO PLAY SUPERMAN"></head><body><p>This DVD set contains Superman I ONLY but also includes a lot of feature stuff that definitely enhances the film and the actors. For example, the selection of a Superman and of Lois Lane is detailed. After explaining the casting decisions, the process is understood as not so easily accomplished.<br /><br />This film is the story of Superman (Christopher Reeves), from his mother and father's life on Crypton, to growing up as a man on planet Earth, to finally functioning as the super hero we all know. The mild sided Clark Kent works as a newspaperman, providing the opportunity to hear crime news. He meets Lois Lane but has more and more difficulty keeping the identity secret. Lex Luther (Gene Hackman) appears as the super villain and fences off in a spectacular showdown with Superman.<br /><br />In the features, Gene Hackman applauds Christopher Reeves for the decision to take on the role. Once typecast, Mr. Reeves would find it difficult to shake. Many humorous cuts are shown (not seen in the film) with Gene Hackman and Christopher Reeves. This gives the viewer insight into the actors.<br /><br />Similarly, many fine actresses were tried for the part of Lois Lane without success. It's interesting to discover oneself in the part of the casting director searching for the qualities needed in the discovery process.<br /><br />I recommend this four disc set.</p></body></html>

It had beautiful women, such as Farrah Fawcett, Jacqueline Smith and Tanya Roberts, but also had some nasty anti-male undercurrents.  This 2000 rendition, instead of being anti-male, is pro-fun.<p>It takes all of 2 minutes into this movie to figure out that it doesn't take itself too seriously.  In fact, it is a borderline spoof of the 70s series, even making fun of itself at times.  There are also some scenes which make fun of stuff from the 70s, such as Disco and Soul Train.<p>This movie is absurd, but it's a fun kind of absurd.  It does not try to convince otherwise.  Following in the footsteps of &quot;Xena:  Warrior Princess,&quot; this film is action packed, sexy and highly entertaining.  On the casting side, Drew Barrymore is a bit of a reach, but Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu are marvelous.  This is a great flick for those who liked the 70s TV show, and probably an even more enjoyable movie for those who didn't.</p></body></html>

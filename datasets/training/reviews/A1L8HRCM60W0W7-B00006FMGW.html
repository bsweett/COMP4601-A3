<meta name="summary" content="GLIB CAPER WITH DELICIOUS 60s ESCAPISM"></head><body><p>An amusing if overdrawn double martini blend of scams and flirtation that etches its light-hearted arc with good old fashioned tale of a lovable rogue pursued relentlessly by a single-minded cop, who over time develops a paternalistic interest in his prey.<br /><br />The touchy feely moments are fortunately never too campy and the cheeky ones never too risque. Most of the Oh-so-cool pilot moments are probably a bit dated (pilots being little more than commercial chauffers today, unlike their glam roles 30 years ago) but De Caprio oozes a dark chocolate blend of slick charm and lonely-boy vulnerability.<br /><br />The opening sequence (of title credits) has a fabulously artistic Saul Bass type sketch video that alone is worth the price of the dvd. Which is great because the DVD has fairly few features otherwise.<br /><br />Don't expect a classic, but for a breezy evening to pass the time, catch this if you can.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Caustic humor, which goes a little too far this time..."></head><body><p>Borat was a bit of a disappointment considering how good Ali G Indahouse had been, not to mention all the hype surrounding the release of this latest movie.  The film brings to the screen the Kazakh sex-starved journalist Borat, as he travels across the USA on an errand by his government to make a documentary on the American way of life.<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen takes the country by storm when he hits the American shores and starts picking on as many different groups as possible; from politicians, minorities and religious groups to feminists, hotel staff and innocent passerby's.<br /><br />His success lies in the indiscriminate use of caustic humor against everybody.<br /><br />However, unlike in Ali G Indahouse and the Da Ali G Show-The Complete First Season, a.k.a. Ali G in Da USAiii, where the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful, in Borat it's just average and in some cases, such as the male nude "wrestling" scenes, just tasteless and sad.<br /><br />Nevertheless it does have its moments and at times it does make you hold your breath in anticipation or burst out laughing.<br /><br />In addition, the way Borat had that crowd going with "We support your war of terror!" was hilarious and he managed to get his message across very effectively.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's an ok movie if you're in a silly mood and/or are heavily intoxicated, and that's about it; no masterpiece here.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The first BOMB from Eli Roth comes in the form of Hostel....sorry buddy, wasnt that great in my eyes"></head><body><p>Ah, here we are with Hostel (a supervised lodging for youth) and in this movie Jay Hernandez (Crazy/Beautiful, Ladder 49), Derek Richardson (Reeker, Bring It On Again) and another guy go on a trip to Europe to party and try to find some young hot girls and well, get laid and have themselves a good old time. Well it seems that way at first when some of that stuff happens (complete with girl nudity, sure to give horror junkies or young boys a rising action....I found it to be stupid and useless). One by one the friends start to vanish and find themselves in a complete hell as they are tortured by sadistic people who cut up bodies and all sorts of sick and twisted stuff. Will anyone survive? What will happen? Will Eli Roth make a good movie? Uh, maybe...maybe not. I wasnt a fan of Cabin Fever although I did like some of the visuals and the performances by both Rider Strong and Guiseppe Andrews but I never liked it. Now in Hostel, Eli Roth's first BOMB so far. Roth, let's make an effort. I'm sure Eli Roth fans will get their deserved horror junkie boner from this movie but it's badly acted and a waste of Rick Hoffman (Cellular, Blood Work) and a quick cameo by Audition & Ichi The Killer director Takashi Miike. Roth himself has a cameo as a American Stoner. Quentin Tarantino, you may have been clapping, cheering and hollering but I wasnt. I like you Tarnatino but I dont like this movie. We all have our tastes....I have mine.</p></body></html>

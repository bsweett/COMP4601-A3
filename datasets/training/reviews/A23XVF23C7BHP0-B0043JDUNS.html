<meta name="summary" content="Worthy Sequel consolidates film series"></head><body><p>Having really enjoyed the first Iron Man film, I was really looking forward to seeing this follow-up. Knowing that Chaplin's Robert Downey Junior was once again assigned to the lead role, I was reassured that this would not be another of those sequels that merely trades off the success of its predecessor (see Police Academy). The film didn't disappoint. It was more of the same, both in quality and tone, which is what I wanted, and I suppose most other Iron Man fans wanted.<br /><br />The story follows up from the original film, but is heavily influenced by Robocop and its sequels, with humour undercutting the drama in many places. It isn't so comedic that the serious part is undermined, but there are quite a few broad comedy moments. The character of Tony Stark disturbs a little in places, his self-destructive nature in terms of his business, his environment, and his health are all darker features of the character that elsewhere exhibits great optimism and positivity. Downey Junior brings this complex character to life - so that when he is out partying, you can see in his eyes the darker undertones of his personality. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts, although a reset switch appears to have been hit, and the closeness they achieved towards the end of the first film is forgotten about and she is just his assistant, rather than nearly his wife. The relationship follows pretty much the same path this film, although she has a rival in the form of a sexy spy Scarlett Johansson, and an all star cast is completed with appearances from a very dirty looking Mickey Rourke as a Russian physicist with a grudge against Tony and Samuel Jackson as a spy pretty similar to the role he played in the Matrix.<br /><br />Don Cheadle is great as his friend, Rhodey, but he's a recast from Terrence Howard in the first film. Don makes a very good job of this and by the end, you forget that he's not the same actor, and Marvel Comics boss Stan Lee's cameo as Larry King has to be seen to be believed! Gary Shandling puts in a semi-comic performance as a senator, who is there to needle Stark, and threaten to take away his Iron Man suit. Shandling is just right for the role, looking now rather like a grinning Jimmy Carter/Kennedy type politician.<br /><br />Overall, the look of this on blu-ray is excellent, and you can see how well the sets and effects have been made, although it's a shame that the extras are very pedestrian, and it feels like little effort has been made with these. Clearly they are holding something back for the two disc edition, but this feels a bit mean, and makes disc collectors like me want to wait for "ultimate edition"s before buying. This doesn't detract from the film though, which is heartily recommended to anyone who liked the original film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Oedipal Candidate...."></head><body><p>...the creepy Shaw son here reminded me of Anthony Perkins' performance of Norman Bates and while I generally dig Meryl Streeps' scene chewing, her acting here only whets your appetite for classic Streep overreaching like in Postcards from the Edge or more recently Angels in America...I mean to say, the director and editor don't allow the viewer to revel in Senator Shaw's maliciousness--hence Streep's fine acting--for too long before the story is quickedited along. Denzel does a good job as the soldier whose memory of a certain event during the Gulf War haunts him in unforgettable dreams. I was not pleased at how the thriller came to a close. My problem is that the last 10 minutes lets down the suspense and tension cleverly built up in the earlier three-quarters of this version the film. But if you've seen the original, you will appreciate this remake and you will appreciate casting Streep as the power starved Mother (although her scenes seem too short)....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Major dissapointments all round - Not the MR I head about..."></head><body><p>I missed this film twice in the cinema and only got around to watching it on DVD after all these months. Since word of mouth and the reviews had tooted this murder-mystery drama vehicle as Clint Eastwood's best thing since "Unforgiven" and with a cast to die for, Mystic River seemed like the kind of film that I would actually prepare my day around watching. Mystic River was not only a major disappointment but begs to ask questions about how this film got such acclaim? Was it on the bases of the book's following? Is this a case of what looks good on the page not translating to the screen? No it is more than just that - the acting is a way Over The Top (wait for Sean Penn to start crying out for his daughter in a crowd of officers) and at times appears as if the actors and actresses are aware of the camera (wait until the last scene to see this at its most distracting). Okay so we could live with a little OTT, but not only is the story really overacted but it is just plain bad and is terribly, terribly, slow (and this is coming from someone who watches Tarkovsky - no problem). So when I say slow I mean S-L-O-W is a sort of Steve McQueen "Bullet" sort of way where things are almost done in real time and nothing happens for up to ten minutes on end. People in the room fell asleep while watching this. Yes Eastwood manages to give us one of these long five minute shots where people sit around talking about grief - then in the next scene does exactly the same again! We where waiting maybe one hour and twenty minutes after the murder for something to happen, and it does, but it is just pointless at that moment because you don't care and just want to get this soppy completely dull viewing over and done with and Eastwood put back in the old folks home as soon as possible. Mystic River is a low-budget direct to DVD release that has someone managed to get itself `stars' and put itself on the silver screen. Without the stars the story is JUNK, television network quality screenwriting. It seems that a domino effect may have occurred with all the actors signing on one after the other like lemmings.<p>The story, which I tried hard to avoid to read about(and wish I didn't) seems complex on the outside but is thoroughly hollow with some extraordinary scenes that totally break any realism that the film tries to employ. I would recommend Penn movie "The Pledge" or even "Sleepers" over this one any day of the week. <p>Sean Penn plays Jimmy Markum, an ex-con with a family, Annabeth (Laura Linney who turns up for about four small scenes), a daughter who winds up dead in the side of the road battered to death with a bullet in her head, a detective, Kevin Bacon playing Sean Devine, who is hot on the case with Laurence Fishburne, Whitey Powers. Tim Robbins, playing Dave Boyle, comes home one night with blood all over him and a strange story about possibly killing a mugger. His wife Celeste, Marcia Harden, believes that Dave may have murdered Jimmy's girl. Tom Guiry plays Brendan Harris, son of a criminal who was connected to Jimmy and who wants to run away with Jimmy's daughter and to leave his deaf and dumb brother and friend behind. Jimmy, Sean and Dave used to grow up together in the neighbourhood but Dave was abducted and abused when he was younger.<p>Sounds good right? Yeah this sounds like the makings of a really good crime drama, but it is all fake with the central plot revolving around Dave and Celeste's marriage breaking up and Celeste telling Jimmy what she 'thinks' she knows. So you can guess where this probably all goes in the end, but it is pointless because it is just so dull, lifeless and ultimately this movie GOES NOWHERE with an ending that is sprung from the pages of how to write a clich&eacute;d script. It is all bad bar the acting, but even at times the big names fail to bring us anything engaging by possibly trying to be too smart about something that wasn't. <p>Bottom line in this thing is that it is a disappointment and drawn out slowly over a very thin plot with cornflakes box characters. <p>Avoid and pretend that you never saw the REAL Mystic River that you heard about. Even Stir of Echoes is miles better than this thing!</p></body></html>

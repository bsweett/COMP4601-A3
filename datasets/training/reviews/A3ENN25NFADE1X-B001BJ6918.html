His other personality is Clark Kent, He was born Superman." What Bill(David Carradine) is trying to explain is that Uma's character was born as the Black Mamba, her alter ego is "The Bride." SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />Quentin once again proves that he is a master film maker and he is God in Hollywood. What he try's to do is show who these characters are. You learn to like Bill inspite of yourself, we know he's a horrible person, we know he's a killer, his talent is killing, but we do know he obviously loves her. He did a horrible act out of love for her.<br /><br />Chris Rock's Quote: "Have you ever loved somebody so much that sometimes you want to kill them." That quote sort of makes sense in this film. This is a Quentin Tarantino love story. Some people feel sorry for Bill because he loves her. Not that people will kill in the name of love, but some have. Now all of a sudden Uma Thurman is the bad guy for at least a little while, but you feel sympathetic to her aim as well. She wants revenge, because he did wrong by her, she feels betrayed, like he cheated her in some way, cheated her by taking the idea of a normal life for her and her baby.<br /><br />I don't like Bill, but I do understand why he did what he did, and I understand why the Bride feels so angry. And with there last words, Bill Quotes: I love you Kiddo. The Bride Quotes: I love you to. In my opinion, this is one of the craziest and one of the best love story's ever created.</p></body></html>

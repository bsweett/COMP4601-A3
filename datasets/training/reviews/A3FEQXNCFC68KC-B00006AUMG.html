<meta name="summary" content="Lots of awesome action, but very little content to back it up."></head><body><p>Let me make one thing clear: This movie has killer action! I will not deny that and if it weren't for other aspects of the movie it would have gotten a higher rating just for the action. Unfortunately all the bad stuff cancels out the good stuff for me.<br /><br />There are some things I just can't forgive and one is plain stupidity and lack of continuity. The people in this movie are dumb as dirt. At the beginning of Blade we have him fighting off vampires wearing these neat "day suits" that protect them from UV light. Funny thing is they conveniently forget they have these useful garments when they have to hunt during the day. Talk about stupid. Not only that, it is established that the big bad hybrid vampires that are the main focus of Blade 2 can only be killed by UV light, yet the idiots still pack a ton of firepower instead of a mess of flashlights. Man... brainless testosterone sure does flow thick in that movie. Another thing I felt was overkill was Blade's new chemical formula he laces all of his weapons and bullets with (well the bullets are packed with it... not laced) and the fact that a single drop of this stuff is apparently enough to BBQ a vampire's entire body. Just seems like they are pushing the envelope here.<br /><br />The plot is somewhat derivative and only gives Blade a reason to kill things. Granted Blade came from a Marvel comic book and the movie does attempt to stick with a comic book styled story, but come on! Give us some depth here! There was a painfully predictable love interest that doesn't do much for the movie at all. There are also a few "surprise" plot twists that are also utterly predictable and bring nothing to the table. And as much as I like Wesley Snipes and as much I like what he brings to the character, the perpetual "cool pose" theme gets old. Just once I would like to see Blade tie his shoe or even just stand still in a non-cool way. Quick Blade! While you answer the phone. Strike a pose!!<br /><br />Still in all of the story content bashing I make this movie has some of the greatest action scenes ever. The fighting is intense and the choreography is stylish without being campy. I really mean it. The action in Blade 2 is awesome. The special effects are well done for the most part and little things like the lighting, camera angles and sound are also done well. In other words the action scenes and production values are top notch... except for the soundtrack.  The soundtrack is nice but it felt forced fed. It seems every time you're in a club and someone turns away for a minute a new song is on (conveniently being a song from the Blade 2 Soundtrack). One scene in this movie seems to pack at least five songs within ten minutes.<br /><br />If you're into nothing but action, action, and ACTION then Blade 2 is just the movie for you. If you like both action and good story telling then be forewarned; you will have to weigh great action with lame plot and judge for yourself. Of course if you are all about content and care little for action you might as well save your money and wait until it comes on cable or broadcast TV. Blade 2 is a great action film and nothing more.</p></body></html>

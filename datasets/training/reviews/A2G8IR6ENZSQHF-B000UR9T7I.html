<meta name="summary" content="Most disappointing movie in a summer full of them"></head><body><p>By "most disappointing movie of the summer," let me clarify that "Spider-Man III" was not the worst movie of the summer by any means, but in terms of the quality we were expecting compared to the quality we received, it definitely is at the bottom of the list.<br /><br />Well, I saw it, partly because my ex-girlfriend had some free tickets and partly because I had to pass by the theater anyways because it was on the way to the library.  And I can say that "Spider-Man III" instantly made the list of one of the year's most disappointing films.  The film is so mediocre that it will immediately make you want to watch "Spider-Man I and II: They Were Better" over again, just to regain your pleasant memories of the franchise.<br /><br />Well, I guess there's some fun to be had with "Spider-Man III," but it's a pale shadow of what's come before.  What's wrong with the film?  The first problem is that it tries to cram way too much into its 140-minute running time.  Not only is Spider-Man fighting two villains to begin with, he's also having to deal with an evil alien substance (which came from God knows where) that briefly turns him evil.  Then, he gets this substance off only for it to possess the character of a rival photographer.  So Spider-Man is fighting three villains, in addition to having to deal with a surprisingly whiny Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst, looking as weepy and helpless as ever).  With all these subplots going on, none of them ever quite gains momentum, and some simply stop in mid-sentence.<br /><br />The plotting alone would have sunk the film to a good degree, but there is a lot of other awful stuff happening.  First, there's the acting.  As mentioned earlier, Dunst is little more than a screentime eater.  Tobey Maguire is good as the normal Spider-Man/Peter Parker, but is jaw-droppingly godawful as their evil alter ego.  He reminded me of Hayden Christiansen in "Attack of the Clones" more than a terrifying menace.  Hayden Church and Franco are OK as Sandman and Goblin (respectively), but Topher Grace as Venom gives one of the worst performances in a comic book film this decade.  He plays Venom with all the cheesy menace of a Fantastic Four villain, and his appearance immediately took me out of the film.<br /><br />Then there's tonal problems.  Parts of the movie are as campy as anything in "Batman and Robin," (especially the increasingly awful one-liners) while others are similar in tone to a soap opera, making for a bizarre contrast that never fits together.  Perhaps most irritatingly, there are serious gaps in logic.  Why is Sandman not shocked at all that he's suddenly turned into a Sandman?  Since when did Harry Osbourne's butler become a genius?  Why can Sandman withstand the pummeling of a speeding train but not two small rockets?  Doesn't Harry forgive someone awfully fast that blew half his face off?  Doesn't Sandman change his mind about Spider-Man awfully quickly?  And Mary Jane...<br /><br />I'm going to stop here, to try to not give away too much.  This is definitely a major disappointment, on the level of "X3."  Its studio is obviously panicky over its financial performance, as it was quick to release polls that showed how much people "liked the film."  They're covering up something, as I have yet to meet anyone that has said anything more positive about it other than, "Well, it wasn't as good as the first two, but it still entertained me."  So, if you feel you must see it, beware to lower your expectations beforehand.  Otherwise, you face crushing disappointment.</p></body></html>

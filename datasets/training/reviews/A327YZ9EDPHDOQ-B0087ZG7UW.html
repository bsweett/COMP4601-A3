<meta name="summary" content="Psycho...classic Hitchcock...classic scary movie!!"></head><body><p>In my personal opinion Psycho is truly one of scariest and suspense filled movies of all time. What more can you ask. A woman accused of stealing 40 thousand dollars...the infamous shower scene...a hotel proprietor gone beserk. It's a classic! Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins clicked in this 1960 Hitchcock thriller! Believe me once you see it you'll never take a shower again!!</p></body></html>

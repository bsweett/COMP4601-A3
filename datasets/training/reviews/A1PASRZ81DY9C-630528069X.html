Then, another even greater is how real the villainous character is. Unlike most standard action-adventure movies, Die Hard is a machine that intensifies the plot every minute through scene by scene, woven tied together by two primary parallelisms: that of Bruce Willis and the other of Alan Rickman. The latter, for the role of Hans Gruber, is an Oscar caliber performance, which marked the "finally" we have an intelligent villain to watch. The script is well-done, but it couldn't be done as well without the majority of the help from special effects work. Just like Predator, John McTiernan is able to blend in the special effects smoothly with the surreal adventure of the violent nuked skyscraper. I love the portrayal of how the so-called terrorist group work by the elaborate setup and how did the group go by about it. Die Hard is as real as it gets for me. The poster of Bruce Willis with the building is just awesome.<br /><br />6/11: Die Hard is one intense machine that refuses to let down from start to finish. To this day, the special effects are spectacular as ever. The realism maintained by the characters is what makes the film to work. I still love that performance by Alan Rickman, usually a very funny guy. With a possible exception for next two sequels, I can safely say that Die Hard is probably the only time that Bruce Willis could be taken seriously as an actor. All in all, I can never forget my experience of seeing Die Hard in theaters in 1988. It was an experience. I am bringing the rating of the movie up from '9' to '10'.</p></body></html>

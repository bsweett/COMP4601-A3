<meta name="summary" content="A Successful Sequel and a Sure Summer Blockbuster"></head><body><p>Live Free or Die Hard (aka Die Hard 4) is the perfect summer blockbuster - a smart popcorn fare with incredible action-packed sequences, outstanding special effects, smart dialogue, and a well-executed plot. It's the kind of movie Spiderman 3 wanted to be. It's the kind of movie that Pirates of the Caribbean 3 should've been. Instead, this summer, all the action/adventure belongs to a 52-year-old Bruce Willis Die Hard Collection (Die Hard / Die Hard 2 - Die Harder / Die Hard with a Vengeance), Perfect Stranger) reprising his role as the wisecracking New York cop John McClane.<br /><br />In 2001, Willis proclaimed that he would no longer do violent action or "save-the-world" movies. Had he stayed true to his statement, we would've missed out on one of the best movies of 2007.<br /><br />Live Free or Die Hard is the first respectable sequel in the summer of sequels. It is a great film not just for the Die Hard or action/adventure lover, but a great movie in general.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did and I extend my full recommendation for it. It's truly a perfect Fourth of July movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Horror Parody"></head><body><p>Bubba Ho-Tep is a hilarious movie featuring a still alive Elvis Presley who teams up with a lunatic who believes that he is John F. Kennedy to fight an insane Egyptian mummy.  One of the more interesting aspects of this movie is the fact that Elvis feels guilty for having exchanged places with an Elvis impersonator so that he could live a normal life.  <p>This is a really funny movie.  Led by veteran B-movie actor Bruce Campbell as Elvis, the cast as a whole delivers a consistently strong performance.  Of all the horror parodies that I have seen, this is one of the very best.</p></body></html>

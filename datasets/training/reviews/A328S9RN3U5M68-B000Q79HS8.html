Director Paul Greengrass has dialed all of the cameras' and actors' meters to breakneck speed, and while the big screen does at times seem overwhelmed by all the blitzkrieg action, the characters appear so involved that the film is all of a piece. Reprising their roles are Matt Damon (who handles this genre very well), Julia Stiles, a glimpse at Franka Potente, and very fine acting by Joan Allen and Brian Cox. This is a high suspense frolic and well worth jumping on for the escapist ride. The locales are beautiful - Goa,India, Berlin, Moscow, a New York City. And if you can take time to notice, the musical score by John Powell has some truly beautifully written moments. A terrific escape from the media doldrums!</p></body></html>

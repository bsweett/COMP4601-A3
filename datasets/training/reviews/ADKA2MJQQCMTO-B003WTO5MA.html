If Hollywood is so insistent on trotting out a seemingly endless number of remakes, then remake a BAD movie.  There's no fan base to aggravate, no 'sacred ground' that couldn't be tinkered with, a workable storyline, and instant name recognition.  Not to mention that I HATED the original 'Amityville Horror'.  So right up front, this was a film that had my attention.<br /><br />So how'd it do?  Pretty well actually.  I'm not sure I'd BUY it, but there was certainly enough good to justify a rental.  The acting was good, the effects were well-done and creepy, and the sound was awesome.  Just as an aside, this movie is MUCH eerier with a 5.1 surround system.  Hearing phantom foot-steps behind you and voices coming at you from different angles really adds a dimension that just isn't there when you watch in stereo or mono sound.<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit that I'm nit-picking a little bit, but I did want to mention a couple of the issues I had:<br /><br />1. The casting choices- While the acting, I felt, was really pretty good, the casting decisions had me scratching my head a little bit.  Both Ryan Renolds and Melissa George were too young or the actors playing their children were too old.  The way I figure it, Melissa George would have been about twelve when she had her first child.<br /><br />2. The film showed its cards a bit too early going right for the cheap jump-moments.  If we've all learned anything from `Jaws' it's that you don't need to show the shark right away to build up tension.<br /><br />3. One of the ONLY things I felt the original film did well was giving a genuine sense of "family" between the Lutz's.  I never really felt that in this movie.  I almost felt like I was watching five individuals going their own way.  Nobody ever seemed to "connect."  Part of the problem, I felt, was the sub-plot of George Lutz as the "New Dad". I felt like that alienated George's character too much and pulled the rug out from under the film.<br /><br />4. The character of the minister was significantly reduced from the first film.  I would have either expanded his part or just cut him completely.  I thought for sure we'd see him blessing the house before the Lutz's moved in.<br /><br />When all's said and done I'd give this a solid 3 stars out of five.  Certainly a much better outing then the original.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="So it's true ... Hollywood can still make movies ......"></head><body><p>that are superb and enjoyable without knowing exactly what is going to happen in the first 3 minutes of the film .....<p>Ok .. there is one thing that may detract from this movie, and may be a reason for some people to review it negatively, and that is that you must be quiet and pay attention to the film. Oh my goodness thats almost blasphemy today in a world of very very light intellectual fare ..... <p>The character study and writing is absolutely fabulous and so well balanced that all the actors absolutely shine and are able to present challenging roles perfect to character. That the director, Guy Ritchie, cast Brad Pitt as the Irish gypsy with a dialect that only his band and his mother would understand took courage, and thats what makes this film exceptional. I mean all<br />you have to do is watch 'Enemy at the Gates' and listen to the stupidest accents of the Russians and the Germans to know what a 'sell out' directs work looks like ... total poop .... Anybody who has ever met a gypsie knows that they have their own 'for all intents and porposes' language that they only understand... <p>That then is the juice of 'Snatch' in that the other characters all make bets and buy things from the gypsies without really knowing what they are buying or betting on, and, they are too embarrased to ask ... Meanwhile, the gypsies don't take any notice, since they understand everyone perfectly, and just wonder why everyone around them is so stupid and practiccally begging to be taken advantage of .... <p>Tyrone, played by Ade, the getaway driver that is bigger than the car and can't drive was so hllarious I could barely get off the floor laughing .... <p>On the technical side the disc has been flawlessly produced and has been cut as a dual-layer-disc allowing the viewer to see this film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1:85:1 ... <p>This movie will rekindle your faith in Hollywood filmaking even though it was mostly filmed in the UK .....</p></body></html>

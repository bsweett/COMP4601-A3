Set in a rather murkily-defined alternate world where dirigibles like the Hindenburg III still cruise the skies and World War II apparently took place well before it happened in our reality (and without Hitler), it finds intrepid "girl newshound" Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) and mercenary pilot Sky Captain (Jude Law) trying to fight through a past romantic history while attempting to find out who's responsible for the disappearance of a laundry list of European scientists and the creation of an array of sophisticated giant robots attacking New York City.  When the Captain's head mechanic Dex (Giovanni Ribisi) manages to isolate the region from which the robots' orders are being dispatched, he's kidnapped from his base, and now the hunt becomes personal.  With the help of Frankie (Angelina Jolie), the eye-patched commanding officer of a British airborne station, Polly and the Captain eventually track down the mysterious Dr. Totenkopf (Sir Laurence Olivier), only to discover that things aren't everything they seem.  With a nice mix of futuristic and '30's-era gadgetry and great digital SFX, this movie should appeal to anyone who enjoys the Indiana Jones franchise, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038ZITIE">Flash Gordon</a>, or the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHQTZO">King Kong</a>.

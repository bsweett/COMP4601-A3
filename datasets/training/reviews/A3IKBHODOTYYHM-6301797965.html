<meta name="summary" content="Young Frankenstein never gets old, a must for fans of the film or book"></head><body><p>There are so many things to like about Young Frankenstein, which is as much a homage to the Frankenstein legacy as it is a satire. Taking parts from many of the Universal Frankenstein films, (Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein, The Son of Frankenstein) Young Frankenstein parodies the most memorable moments from these Universal classics. Unlike many spoofs that have aged, this film is still quite clever, the jokes original and well-timed. There are so many witty lines and memorable scenes.<br /><br />The cast really makes this film tick. Gene Wilder is such a perfect fit for the grandson of the late Dr. Frankenstein. He attempts to distance himself from the Frankenstein legacy; he pronounces his name "Fronkenstten" and dismisses his grandfather's achievements. However, when he learns of a will, and visits the Frankenstein castle and discovers his father's book "How I Did It", he is overcome with zealous passion to continue the family legacy. Wilder has such a knack for knowing how to hit the right note for comedic effect. Marty Feldman as Igor is a no-brainer; he has the right physical look, and his mannerisms and level of comic grotesqueness make for some good laughs. Terri Garr is wonderful as the sexy blonde assistant Inga, Madeline Kahn perfectly performs the role of Wilder's fianc&eacute;e, and Peter Boyle embodies the giant-child like monster to a tee. There is also a funny cameo from Gene Hackman as the blind hermit who encounters the monster, a classic scene worth viewing repeatedly.<br /><br />The extras are quite impressive as well. Making Frankensense of Young Frankenstein takes a deeper look at the ideas behind the satire. It explores Wilder's inspiration to create this film, his collaboration with Mel Brooks, the script, and a look at the casting and roles and the vision for the film.  There are also trailers for the film, deleted scenes, interviews, and an optional commentary from Brooks.<br /><br />A superb comedy that has stood the test of time, and is a tribute to the Frankenstein story, Young Frankenstein never gets old. Any fans of Mary Shelley's classic or the Universal classics should check this one out.</p></body></html>

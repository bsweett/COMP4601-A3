All of the extra features are right on the money particularly the menus.  Sheri Moon, Sid Haig and Karen Black give some tremendously fun performances in this movie.  See it for their acting alone.  One day the scene w/ Moon lip synching &quot;I Wanna Be Loved By You&quot; will be considered a classic.  Not for all tastes.</p></body></html>

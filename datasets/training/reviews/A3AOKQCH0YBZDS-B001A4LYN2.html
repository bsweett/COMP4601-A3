<meta name="summary" content="Too Long, Too Slow.... Otherwise Good"></head><body><p>This movie is too long and too slow.... I think that it could have been made into a much shorter length movie and made its point in much less time then the 2.5 hours it took to do so.<br /><br />The acting on all counts by all cast members was magnificent. Daniel Day Lewis is perfect for the role of Daniel Plainview, the single-minded individual whose sole purpose in life is to get rich through mining oil.... Daniel Plainview is an entirely ruthless individual whom isn't above lying and using any other devious means necessary to obtain what he wants.... Primarily money, wealth, success and power. Plainview doesn't have friends and hates humanity at large and is unwavering in his behavior throughout the entire movie. It is a bit difficult to believe anyone could be this callous, ruthless, and downright mean as Daniel Plainview.... He's almost one dimensional because he is so one sided in his callousness.<br /><br />This movie seems to represent what one will do out of greed/hunger for money and conquest. It is as if the ends justify the means no matter what the cost is.</p></body></html>

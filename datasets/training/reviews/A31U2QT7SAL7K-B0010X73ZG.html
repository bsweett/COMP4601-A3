That title belongs to Marcia Gay Harden's "Mrs. Carmody," a religious zealot who manages to throw the seeds of mistrust into the grocery store as the assembly tries to map out its strategy to deal with marauding horde outside the doors.  The screenwriter crafted a character that truly believes that she is "the messenger of God" and that only she can weed out the true "evil" and she manages to turn others to her side, resulting in brother turning against brother.<br /><br />The film also allows fair screen time from the "minor" characters, giving each significance and even "noble deaths."  Great performances are delivered by star Thomas Jane, Laurie Holden, Frances Sternhagen, Andre Braugher, Ollie Weeks, William Sadler, Sam Witwer, and young Nathan Gamble as Jane's son.  In fact, much praise should be given to the remaining cast members who manage to show what happens when "mob mentality" takes over.<br /><br />Like any good "monster" film, they are kept at a minimum, springing out at the right time to effectively maximize the fear quota.<br /><br />A plus on the DVD is the inclusion of a B & W cut of the movie, further solidifying its 50's monster movie origins.</p></body></html>

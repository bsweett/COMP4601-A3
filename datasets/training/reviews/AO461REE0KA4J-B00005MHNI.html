<meta name="summary" content="About the remastered DVD"></head><body><p>While comparing the new remastered DVD and the old DVD of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, I discovered that the new transfer shows MORE picture on the left and right sides, but LESS at the bottom. The difference in picture amount is not great, but, to me, great enough to affect the composition.  In the scene where Alex kicks his friends into the river in slow motion, some of the toes are cut off due to the less picture at the bottom.  I wouldn't be surprised if this DVD would be re-released again.<p>To me the biggest improvement on the new transfer of ACO is the flesh tones -- they look more realistic, and complexions are generally rosier (although I have to wonder that, for such a dark subject matter, does healthier-looking skin tone enhance the theme of the movie?). Other improvements are the elimination of the graininess, speckles, and other blemishes. The darker scenes (many scenes take place at night and in low-light condition) don't show much improvement at all.</p></body></html>

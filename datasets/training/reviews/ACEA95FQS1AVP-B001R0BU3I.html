<meta name="summary" content="Love Cheadle, but.."></head><body><p>I love a good thriller, and Cheadle is a superb actor.  And while this movie was enjoyable, it's not one I'll rewatch.  I think perhaps the modern terrorist theme is just not good entertainment for me; like so many people who aren't interested in movies about the war in Iraq. It's too real.  And Islam always ends up looking bad (regardless of what side Cheadle is actually on).<br /><br />Cheadle's character is devout Muslin - and that is the only thing that is certain about him.  What his true intentions are, he may know but not even understand.  I think maybe the film tried too hard  (as evidenced by some reviewers saying it's difficult to explain the plot). In an effort to keep the audience guessing which side he is on, there is a lot of back and forth.  He's helping the terrorists (but isn't that how you gain their trust?); he's refusing to come clean with the FBI (isn't that just to maintain his cover?).  Every action could potentially be explained either way.  While this kept the suspense high, it also made the film slow if not a little boring.  Do I really care anymore?<br /><br />Overall, this is worth watching at least once.  Cheadle is a great actor and he carries this movie as well as he can with a somber/depressing topic.  This movie requires a viewer to pay close attention.  This isn't James Bond, or even Jason Bourne, (which are fun popcorn flicks) but it's worth seeing.</p></body></html>

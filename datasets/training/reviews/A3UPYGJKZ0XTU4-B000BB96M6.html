The Key Is in the Audience's Degree of Detachment."></head><body><p>Director Tim Burton's macabre sense of humor meets writer Roald Dahl's macabre sense of humor in this adaptation of Dahl's novel "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory". I hated the first cinematic incarnation of the novel, 1971's "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory", when I was a child, so I loaded this one into my DVD player with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised to be at least mildly engaged in the story and generally entertained, though I have the same qualms about showing "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" to young children that I did about the 1971 film. The film's sometimes sadistic humor may be genuinely disturbing to children, and the eccentric Willy Wonka is just plain creepy. I actually thought it was a horror film when I was a child.<br /><br />Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is an "ordinary little boy" who lives with his impoverished but loving family. One day, the reclusive candy magnate Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) announces that he will allow 5 children to tour his huge and mysterious factory, one of whom will win a grand prize "beyond your wildest imagination". Five Golden Tickets have been placed randomly in Wonka chocolate bars, and children all over the world vie to find them. Poor little Charlie has a wealth of luck and comes up with one of the tickets himself. He chooses his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) to accompany him on the tour, and off they go with four other children and their parents to see how Willy Wonka makes all that delicious candy.<br /><br />Johnny Depp can make creepy, antisocial characters interesting, and he brings a sense of innocence to Willy Wonka that helps. But to tell the truth, Willy Wonka is an unsettling guy who doesn't even like children. Worse, the fates that await the youngsters could easily be the stuff of nightmares -so be careful if you know your child is sensitive. The child actors do a great job of expressing their characters' over-the-top personalities. If the writing has any fault, it is that Charlie is a good boy but a bland character, while his more mischievous companions have stronger personalities and do more to entertain. Annasophia Robb is especially fun to watch as ultra-competitive Violet Beauregarde. "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is obviously intended for children, hence the lessons on the value of family and consequences of disobedience...and the silly song and dance numbers. But the film is peppered with jokes and allusions aimed at adults. It's admirable that "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" strives to entertain its entire audience, but I wonder if the adults won't be just mildly entertained while the kids are just creeped out.</p></body></html>

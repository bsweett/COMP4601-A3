Some people will like it, seeing it as a tribute to the heroes of flight 93; others will no doubt see it as opportunistic and cashing in on the tragedy of the flight. But overall I enjoyed the movie and it seemed to be a realistic enactment of what could have happened on that ill-fated flight. I also liked the fact that the director didn't use big name or professional actors, but who did very well in the movie.<br /><br />I had one more comment to make, but on a perhaps different or unusual topic. I am a martial arts instructor one of whose specialties is knife tactics and knife defense. The hijackers in the movie did not seem very skilled or well trained in knife fighting, which means they could possibly have been overcome by someone who was trained in empty-hand tactics against the knife. These skills are more difficult and take more time to acquire than empty-handed skills, of course, but it can be done. Even if one is a master of these arts, though, there are no guarantees, as anything can happen in a knife fight. One thing that was interesting, though, was how easily the one hijacker with the knife was overcome once the passengers decided to act together. Even a knife-wielding assailant can be overcome if they have to face multiple attackers who come at them from different sides simultaneously. He might be able to get to one or two of the incoming people, but likely not all.<br /><br />Another possibility is that perhaps the flight crew could be trained in the use of the Taser electrical dart/stun gun device, which, although not 100% effective if the person is wearing thick clothing, could be worth considering since it would be much safer to fire in a plane than a gun and would not cause explosive decompression like a gun if the hull was penetrated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, 10,000 years of "civilization" has shown that humans do not seem to able to live in peace, and so both individually and as a species we perpetually live in uncertain and dangerous times. And this movie is a reminder of the fact that the U.S. is a more dangerous place than it was just a few years ago. Overall, though, I thought it was a good movie and a dramatic re-enactment a fitting tribute to those who lost their lives in this tragic event. If we learn from these events then perhaps we can prevent similar tragedies in the future.</p></body></html>

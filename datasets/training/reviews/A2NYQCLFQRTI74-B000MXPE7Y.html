<meta name="summary" content="butchered truth"></head><body><p>How truthful is this film... no one will ever know.<br />How can anyone know anything about a company (CIA) that (supposedly) deals with lies... again, no one will ever know.<br />Important issues are presented here: imperialism, espionage, loyalty, betrayal...<br /><br />This film was certainly worth watching, for Matt Damon's performance (as Edward Wilson) especially. He and *he alone* carries the film on his shoulders.<br />A surprise: De Niro shows a better talent as a director than an actor.<br />Angelina Jolie, as Wilson's wife, overacts way too much and her character is not credible because not well developed. Tammy Blanchard (who plays Laura) definitely has more talent than Jolie.<br /><br />The melodramatic dialogue didn't help the movie, however well directed it may have been.<br /><br />Recommendation to watch _The Good Shepherd_: Pay attention to the dates, as it is rather easy to get lost in the second act, where Russian spies and the Bay of Pigs invasion are mentioned.<br />Better editing and script-writing would have made the film shorter (close to 3 hours!), as many of those details were not needed to understand what was going on.<br /><br />Certainly worth watching, but be prepared to endure three hours of film.</p></body></html>

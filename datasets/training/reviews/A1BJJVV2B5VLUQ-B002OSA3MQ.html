Cotton plays Holly Martins, the long time American friend of Orson Wells' character, Harry Lime. Martins shows up in Vienna and ends up attending Lime's so-called funeral. Quickly, everyone in the cast seems suspicious. Martins starts asking questions to several people who witnessed the truck accident that supposedly took Lime's life. When the stories don't match, Martins decides to spend a little more time in Vienna to investigate. Along the way he meets the beautiful Anna Schmidt (played by Alida Valli) and falls for her. As the police and neighbors try to get Martins out of town... Martins sees Harry Lime alive and well in the shadowy streets. As quick as he can blink, Harry disappears and the chase is off thru the beautiful streets of Vienna. The climax comes when the chase goes down into the sewers underground with Martins and a whole squad of police chasing Harry down. This is a film Hitchcock would have loved to have his name on. This black &amp; white film is beautifully shot... lighting, intense shadows, old classic European architecture in the background, a larger than life ferris wheel, great cast, great acting... and a movie filled with suspense, love, and a whole lot of deception. Cotton is superb throughout. Wells doesn't show up until you're well into the 2nd half of the movie. The 1941 classic &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, or &quot;A Touch Of Evil&quot;, or maybe &quot;The Stanger&quot; are better films featuring Orson Wells... but, Wells has such a huge presence on the screen that he steals the show almost every time. As good as Wells is here, I still believe Cotton's performance is equally on par with Wells. Look for Cotton in other classics like &quot;Deul In The Sun&quot; (with Jennifer Jones), &quot;Niagara&quot; (with Marilyn Monroe), &quot;Othello&quot; (with Wells), &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (with Charlton Heston), and as one of the main characters with Wells in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. The extras include original trailers, old footage of the real &quot;sewer police&quot; in action, &quot;Third Man&quot; radio broadcast, and the treatment of the film being remastered showing before and after examples of photos and movie footage. Great movie... yet still puzzled as to the expensive price.</p></body></html>

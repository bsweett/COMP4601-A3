<meta name="summary" content="*Blu-Ray Review* Despite the Awful Packaging, the Movies and Extras Both Shine"></head><body><p>The films:<br /><br />Definitely one of the most fun film series of the 1980s and early 90s, BTTF really shines. The writing is quite clever when compared to other big-budget tentpole flicks. The ties between the three movies are a lot of fun to notice. Although part 1 is definitely the best of the three, parts 2 and 3 do not drop off too much in quality. Michael J. Fox delivers a good performance, definitely in keeping with the 1980s "slacker antihero" archetype. Christopher Lloyd is also quite good as Doc Brown.<br /><br />Part 2 is a lot of fun, naturally, because it gives us a future as envisioned in the late 1980s. But its second half, which returns to 1955, is perhaps even more clever than the first movie's portrayal, because of how it works to show the same scenes from different angles and points of view.<br /><br />Part 3 is tonally quite different than the first two, and a good portion of its emotional investment hinges on Doc Brown's romance with Clara, played by Mary Steenburgen. Their on-screen chemistry is not exactly incendiary, and thus their segments drag a bit.<br /><br />Serious sci-fi fanatics will find inconsistencies to nit-pick. I certainly noticed some. The portrayal of timeline changes and potential paradoxes are rather mind-boggling, and one gets the impression that the writers resolved to not try *too* hard to create a consistent methodology for the changes. The overall moral to the story is a bit cliche (don't succumb to peer pressure), whereas a deeper ethical investigation of time travel (seems pretty nasty to relegate Biff and his progeny to second-class citizen status merely in order to boost your own family's fortunes) might have been more interesting. But you'll be having so much fun a long the way, that deeper questions such as these tend only to occur a bit later.<br /><br />Any way you slice it, these movies are fun enough to keep the younger set intrigued, and smart enough to satisfy a more mature audience.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />Let me get this out of the way - this packaging stinks. Definitely among the worst box set packaging I've seen. We get six discs packaged in a tri-fold cardboard digipak with no hubs - the discs are held in, on top of each other, by one of the most irritating pieces of plastic ever - you cannot lift these out, you must press and slide the discs in order to avoid bending them precariously against the hard plastic rim of the digipak. Unbelievably dumb. Add to that a totally superfluous cardboard case, which only repeats the box copy contained within, and doesn't even hold the innards secure when lifting. A complete and utter failure, on all counts. I wish companies wouldn't keep trying to reinvent the wheel with these sets. Just put some hubbed "pages" on a hinge, for crying out loud.<br /><br />Anyway, the 1080p, 1.85:1 film transfers are nice, especially when considering the era in which these movies were filmed. Compared to films of a similar vintage (such as Star Trek 2-4, Goodfellas, and Batman), these transfers show a good amount of detail and not a terrible amount of noise reduction and edge enhancement (see: Predator). If grain was aggressively reduced on these films, it is not noticeable. They are a definite upgrade over DVD-quality material. The video will not blow you away when compared to a newly-minted transfer of a 2009 or 2010 film. But let's compare apples to apples - these are really good transfers of 80s material. The DTS-HD sound also does a good job, with decent separation of channels, clear dialogue, and some decent bass.<br /><br />The extras are good, with commentaries, several new HD making-of and interview features, and plenty of legacy SD features from previous releases. I do wish we could have had Fox's retrospective interview condensed into one feature instead of split into a dozen snippets per disc. Also featured are the apparently obligatory (and utterly wasteful in my book) digital copies for those of you who wish to watch these movies on a 2-inch screen in the car. Yawn.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Despite the overpoweringly dumb packaging, this set is a definite recommendation. It is a good set of family films (there is some mild swearing, but very little sex or violence) that will entertain both kids and adults. The a/v quality is more than acceptable for a high definition release of 1980s films. The extras are comprehensive and entertaining. The price point on Amazon is quite sound for a catalog release.<br /><br />In short, if you like these movies at all, this is a very good buy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""let's roll" Todd Beamer"></head><body><p>we all remember the day and where we were. we all have the sight of aircraft slaming into buildings seared into our collective memory. we also have many moments that left us all with pride in our country and our fellow americans,firemen climbing up stairs as people are running down,policemen doing the same,stories of people carrying people in wheelchairs down 70 and 80 floors never even knowing who they were or their names. perhaps the most shocking site and also the most uplifting moment was the site of a crash in the country side of a plane that never got to it's intended target. the people of flight 93 had the facts that the other planes didn't have because they were late taking off,and in a moment when it really counted made a choice to take back the plane or at least make such it didn't take anymore lives. having seen the a&e movie "flight 93" and thinking it was great i wanted to see this one also. both films are great but very different. "flight" was more about the all around story,while "united" is more about the air traffic controlers and the passangers. paul greengrass has done a wonderful job,much like ron howard did with "apollo 13", in taking a story that we already know the outcome of and still keep you glued to the seat. with actors that are not that well known he has given this movie the feeling of really being there. the film reminds me of "das boot" the world war II movie about german subs,because the camera is confined to the small set of the plane and you feel the closeness of the walls. this isn't some big hollywood action movie with bruce or arnold,no one lone hero here,just 40 people scared to death but not willing to give up or to let others die if it could be stopped. this is an emotional and deeply moving movie of 40 people who did what we all hope we never have to do,they gave their lives to save 100's maybe 1000's of lives. when it's all over this is a very moving tribute to those men and women. it will remain to tell their story of courge long after we who remember pass away! they familes of these hero's should be proud of these peopl;e</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="JUST AWFUL - GROW UP HOLLYWOOD!"></head><body><p>&quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; is the big budget, CGI, wasteful remake of the television show starring Lou Ferrigno that, of course, was based on the huge green guy in DC comics.  Here we get none of the television series depth of character development or interesting narrative.  Instead its a CGI festival, practically from the word GO and its dismal, dismal dismal.  One has the experience of being hurled into a none-too-friendly arcade game and with just about as much detachment as watching a box of cornflakes grow mold. Oh well, at least they're both green!<br />TRANSFER: Fairly decent, though the CGI effects look even more artifical than they did on the big screen.  The desaturated color scheme is nicely balanced.  Texture on Mr. Green is accurate in close ups but tends to get a bit soft around the edges as the hulk goes into tearing up things. Blacks are black. Contrast and shadow delineation is effectively rendered. The audio is 5.1 and explosive - did you expect anything less?<br />EXTRAS: They're there but I have to fess up - after a film as bad as this, I just didn't care!<br />BOTTOM LINE: The hulk should have been cast from the ever growing aray of steroid-abusing bodybuilders that tend to resemble him more and more.  Venice Beach is where the producers should start looking for their follow up sequel, not behind the keyboard of a computer geek with dreams of tossing his computer out the window!</p></body></html>

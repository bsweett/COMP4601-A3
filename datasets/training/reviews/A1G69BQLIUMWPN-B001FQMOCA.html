It was more than either of those.  You get sucked into Johnny's life.  They set up his story on how he ended up on his road to music but the story really takes off once he makes his record and goes on tour.  It shows his highlights and his low times.  It doesn't hold back it doesn't try and show Johnny in a one deminsional light it shows him as human.  I came out of the movie theater having a new found respect for June and Johnny.  Not because they made it big but because they were human and had their tough times, but lived on to make it one hell of a story.  My advise if you catch a movie this winter.  This is one to see.</p></body></html>

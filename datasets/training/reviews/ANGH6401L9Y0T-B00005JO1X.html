Just like a lot of other kids. The similarity with other kids ends right there.<br /><br />While playing hide-and-seek, Lucy (the youngest) discovers an old wardrobe in one of the rooms upstairs and hides in it, only to discover that the back of the wardrobe is a gateway into a snow-covered world which is ever so different from the one she left behind. The first "person" she meets is Mr. Tumnus, a faun. (He is, by the way, a most charming fellow.) He explains that it has been winter in Narnia for 100 years, ever since the Snow Queen took over. "Always winter but never Christmas." How could a child imagine anything more dismal than that?<br /><br />When Lucy goes back through the wardrobe, thinking she had been gone for several hours, she runs out into the stairway shouting, "I'm here! I'm all right!" The others accuse her of not understanding the game of hide-and-seek, as to them, she was only gone a moment. The dismiss her story of having been to Narnia as imagination, and who could blame them? It is clear that the professor knew about the magic in the wardrobe, because he perked up and became very interested earlier when only Lucy had been through, and the others told him that she had been telling some tall tale about going through it into a magical world. He argues that since she is not mad, and not given to lying, they might just believe her.<br /><br />When Lucy goes back to the wardrobe in the middle of the night, Edmund follows her, and discovers that it's all true. Before he catches up with Lucy, however, a white sleigh drawn by white reindeer drives up with the Snow Queen. She plies Edmund with hot chocolate and Turkish delight, and tells him to go back and get his brother and sisters. You see, there is this prophecy . . .<br /><br />Anyway, all four children eventually get to Narnia dressed in fur coats that had been hanging in the wardrobe, and encounter a couple of talking beavers who take them to their home and tell them all about the prophecy. Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve will be the ones to rescue Narnia from the clutches of the Snow Queen. However, Edmund slips out to go find the Queen, and from there on, I'd be telling too much.<br /><br />You know about Aslan, no doubt. He's a large and very magical lion who is a rather obvious metaphor for Jesus Christ, right down to being slain and reborn. An army of assorted magical creatures is gathered on the side of Narnia, and some truly grotesque demons and nasty animals (wolves, most notably, and Minotaurs and all sorts of vicious beings, including a few giants) fighting for the Queen. There's a huge battle, all sorts of exciting incidents involved in it, and of course the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve fulfill the prophecy and become kings and queens.<br /><br />Many years later, when they are all fully grown, they come across the lamppost that stands outside the "back door," if you will, of the wardrobe. They go through, and come tumbling out the front of the wardrobe, back in the Professor's home, and still children. When asked to explain to the professor what they have been up to, Peter says, "If we told you, you wouldn't believe us." The professor tosses something (I couldn't see what) to Peter and says, "Try me."<br /><br />It's a marvelous movie made from a marvelous book, and I hope they eventually make all seven of the books in the series into movies.</p></body></html>

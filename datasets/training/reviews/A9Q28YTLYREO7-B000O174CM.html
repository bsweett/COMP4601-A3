Jennifer Hudson pretty much steals the whole film. Beyonce ain't got a clue at acting.  Jamie foxx is trying to hard and it's mixed. as for Eddie Murphy his many takes on singers and stylings feels like One of his standups,except he is suppose to be playing One,but he can't get One fully right let alone the many he is trying to emulate. the film is too long and it jumps all over the place and it's so cliche and everybody who knows there music history knows this film is about Motown. this Film is a Insult to Motown.  that Corny Broke take on the Jackson Five really took the cake.  this Film was Corny and a straight up slap to the face to what Motown Records Accomplished.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Chick Flick that Guys can like too!"></head><body><p>Okay - I'm a guy who likes Will Smith in comedies and action films.  I love to share a good romantic comedy with the Mrs. but unfortunately WAY too many romantic comedies are not good.  I saw the ads for "Hitch" back when it came into the theatres and what I saw didn't make me want to see it.<br /><br />The Mrs. rented it last night, and we're both glad!  Will Smith plays the title character, a high-priced consultant who turns romantic, but unskilled men into objects of desire.  An opening montage shows hapless klutzes scoring with babes and we buy that "Hitch" must be good at his job.  Eva Mendez is the saucy Sara, a gossip columnist who is so busy and successful at her job that she hasn't thought about romance for years.  Kevin James meets Smith's comic chops every step along the way as the chubby bumbling accountant Albert who secretly pines for his high-profile client, zillionaire heiress Allegra Cole.<br /><br />For a movie like this to work, there has to be a generous and believable dose of "heart" and "Hitch" has it.  The central conflict in the movie comes from the perception about the mysterious "Date Doctor" Hitch.  The actual character has professional morals and ethics.  He doesn't train his clients to deceive their objets d'amour, he just "gives them opportunity".  We meet a jerk early in the film who hires Hitch to get tricks to bed women.  How Hitch sidesteps the guy is the right mixture of heart and machismo.  Wouldn't you know that "Mr. Wrong" later goes out with the best friend of Hitch's romance Sara?  Certainly it makes sense that Sara the gossip columnist would be tracking every move made by Paris Hilton surrogate Allegra.  It even makes sense to question why beautiful Allegra is being seen about town with dumpy Albert.<br /><br />The movie is not perfect.  But there were some honest belly laughs, and more thought than usual into the wittier than usual script.  The Mrs. and I give 2 thumbs up!</p></body></html>

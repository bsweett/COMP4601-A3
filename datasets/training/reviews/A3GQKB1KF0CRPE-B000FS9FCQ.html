<meta name="summary" content="Stunning, one of the best films I've seen in ages!"></head><body><p>Admittedly, I don't go to the theatre much these days with all my deadlines, but I still know what is dead-bang good (for me, at least! lol).  I have not been impressed with this endless stream of regurgitated remakes this past year.  It's like Hollywood has gone brain dead.  Worse, these remakes are sooooooooo weak.  So when a movie moves me, spellbinds me, leaves me breathless, I am so thrilled to find it.  This movie has the pinch of 1984 (odd, since John Hurt was in that film, too), Zorro, Phantom of the Opera...heck, even the "V" is so much like the telly series V!!!  With a film striking so many "chords" within us, it's bound to find an audience, but is it original?  Damn straight it is!<br /><br />This movie, obviously, done in the UK, gives visions of grace and beauty, of the every man wanting a voice, wanting justice, wanting to believe.  It gives you humanity; it gives you romance.  The writing is fast paced, inventive so what was old is new again.  And Hugo Weaving is THE actor for the role of V.<br /><br />Remember, remember the fifth of November...a haunting film that stays with you.  Yes, you will remember, remember!!</p></body></html>

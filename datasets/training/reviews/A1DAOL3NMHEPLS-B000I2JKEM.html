<meta name="summary" content="A Visual Treat with lots of little in-jokes"></head><body><p>"Corpse Bride" isn't quite up to the level of "Nightmare Before Christmas," but it's an entertaining and engaging little movie. (I say "little" because the running time, excluding credits, is only 73 minutes.) The visuals are marvelous, and the performances by the actors providing the characters' voices are all more than adequate. There are numerous "in jokes" scattered throughout the movie. These are mostly visual, although some are not;  the voice of the worm in Emily's eye socket is clearly patterned on Peter Lorre.  The movie's one weakness, if it has one, is a fairly trite plot. There's not much here that you couldn't guess after the first 15 minutes, but the storyline never drags.<br /><br />There are numerous extras on the DVD, and unlike the filler on many discs, they're all pretty interesting. You get to see what was involved in producing many of the special effects, and learn about the philosophy underlying the production.  Overall, this DVD is a winner; I'd rate it 4.5 stars if that were possible. I gave it five stars to bring the average up a bit.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Land of the Dead" is excellent!"></head><body><p>"George A. Romero's Land Of The Dead" is excellent! The directing and screenplay by Romero is excellent. George Romero, is back in the zombie genre that he created after 20 years. This is his first studio in 15 years. This time, Romero has made the zombies smarter and it, unfortunately, works. The cast led by Simon Baker, Dennis Hopper, John Leguizamo, and Asia Argento is excellent. The music by Reinhold Heil & Johnny Klimek is excellent. The cinematography by Miroslaw Baszak is excellent. The film editing by Michael Doherty is excellent. The casting by Marci Liroff is excellent. The production design by Arvinder Grewal is excellent. The art direction by Douglas Slater is excellent. The set decoration by Marlene Puritt is excellent. The costume design by Alex Kavanagh is excellent. The zombie make-up effects by Gregory Nicotero & Howard Berger is excellent. This is one of the best zombie movies in recent history, which includes "28 Days Later" (2003) and last year's remake of Romero's "Dawn Of The Dead" (1979).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Last Samurai"></head><body><p>'The Last Samurai' is a one of those films that has it's flaws but you can't help but enjoy anyway. This film follows Cruise's character as he is captured by a Samurai clan and then learns the lifestyle and ways of a Samurai whilst living in their village. Throughout the story it immerses you in aspects of the history of Japan, and although slightly stylised, gives a good feeling of life and culture in those times. It has beautiful film locations, beautiful music, a good story line and a good cast. I feel this to be one of Cruise's better films and his performance is very credible. This film may be slightly long, but it holds your interest right to the end and is a great nights viewing. Well worth considering.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

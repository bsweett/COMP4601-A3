Stop Fighting Kids, You're Both Right!"></head><body><p>The Illusionist (horrible title!) is a wonderful movie to watch, which makes sense, because it's all about visual illusion, and nobody does visual illusion quite like Hollywood.  From the theatre to the palace, the costumes to the cobblestone streets, carriages, and buildings, the sense of place is compelling - excellent cinematography.  (Norton seems unsure about what sort of accent he is trying to pull off, but for the most part, even the diction and affect of the actors contribute.)<br /><br />The basic story, to say nothing of the dialogue! - is pretty boilerplate, a boy meets girl set-up with a royal court intrigue backdrop.  That's okay because the protagonists are likeable and the villain is really nasty - Giamatti is excellent as the guy in the middle.  Where the film gets into trouble is with its depiction of magic.  Norton - a terrific actor who struggles with unremarkable looks - has been made up well, he's almost dashing.  At times, when he is conjuring, Norton almost seems to have that Svengali dark power of magic, which can be turned to evil purposes at will.<br /><br />I was reminded of a much better movie, The Magician, by Ingmar Bergman.  It was clear in that film that magic, and magicians, emanated from a dark place and were not to be trifled with.  Our Ed, by contrast, has wandered the globe living for years in the Orient and still retains his affable, kid next-door persona - summoning spirits for stunned audiences as casually as you or I would use the phone to summon pizza delivered to our door.  This is one of many ways this picture cheats you.  Is he merely an entertainer, or is there sinister purpose to his shows?  Maybe he just likes being on stage.<br /><br />Bergman's The Magician ends with a chirpy twist which seems to belie everything that came before it, the deus ex machina for which magicians are famous.  It's a deliberate sleight of hand.  The ending of The Illusionist also comes with a twist, but it fails.  Instead of running in contrast to what's come before, it is designed to explain and justify "the show."  In this regard it is incredibly cheap and flabby - like watching playing cards fall from a magician's sleeve as bunnies hop around the stage.  Jessica Biel is exquisite, Rufus Sewell is an excellent baddy, and the antler hallway alone is worth the price of admission.  But don't be tricked into thinking it's anything more than what it is - a nice show.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A nice scare feast"></head><body><p>Okay, so here's the thing, i really did not like 28 Days Later. I saw it because of all the hype about the film and really, i didn't find it scary that much. So naturally, i was hesitant on seeing the sequel, 28 Weeks Later but after words, i regretted ever saying it.<br />The sequel, i feel, is a vast improvement over the first one. The plot of the film takes place, fittingly, 28 weeks after the first film. By now, all of England has been de-contamined and London has already begun repopulation with the help of the US army. All things seem to be going well but when two kids venture out of the 'safe walls', they inadvertly cause a breach in the defense of London and when night comes, the virus will have begun to spread again.<br />Not only are there some pretty tense moments but there are also some pretty thrilling sequences as well. By far, my favorite scene would have to be the subway sequence, where the film maker uses a very unique film technique that produces a very narrow film view that adds the tension of the whole scene.<br />The film can also be viewed as an allegory to our modern day goverment and how there decisions tend to work in their favor over the general population.<br />A very satisfying sequel and definently a scary movie to watch at night.</p></body></html>

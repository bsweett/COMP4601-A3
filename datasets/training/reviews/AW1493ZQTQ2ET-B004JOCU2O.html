<meta name="summary" content="Basic entertainment"></head><body><p>This is a decent action movie, and it's not a small accomplishment that they were able to make the story of a runaway train fairly interesting and quite suspenseful.  The acting is also pretty good, with Denzel Washington delivering as usual, though some of the characters are somewhat cliched.  Also, I do think there's a bit of a plot flaw in the sense that a little creative thinking reveals some easier ways to stop that train, but that's not a major problem since most people probably won't think of these ways during the movie.<br /><br />On a more technical point, I have some professional experience with failure investigation, and I'd like to note that this scenario for developing a runaway train isn't unrealistic.  It may seem too coincidental for so many things to go wrong, both at physical and psychosocial levels, but that's generally how major failures happen.  Such coincidences are rare, and that's why major failures are rare, but in a big and complex world, they're inevitably going to happen now and then.<br /><br />Recommended if you're seeking basic action-oriented entertainment.</p></body></html>

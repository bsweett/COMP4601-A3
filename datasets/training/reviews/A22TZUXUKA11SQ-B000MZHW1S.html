<meta name="summary" content="People back home wouldn't buy a diamond if they knew it cost someone else their hand"></head><body><p>Blood Diamond tells the story of the turmoil that erupted during the late 1990s in Africa surrounding the trafficking of illegal diamonds. The story is told from three different points of view. Djimon Honsou, as an African man whose family is torn apart because of the turmoil. He is forced to work in a diamond mine while his wife and children are spread across Africa by the corrupt rebels. Leonardo DiCaprio, as the jewel smuggler who figures why not make a quick buck even at the expense of the continent he grew up in, since everyone else seeems inclined to do so. And Jennifer Connelly, as an American journalist who is eager to spread the word of the conflict so that it gets more widespread attention and the flow of these "blood diamonds" will stop. As Connelly's character says, "People back home wouldn't buy a diamond if they knew it cost someone else their hand." Or maybe they would. Blood Diamond is a story about good and evil, right and wrong, black and white. It's a story of opposites and how different people react to crisis situations. It was entertaining, to say the least, and action-packed and exciting the whole way through. It also had a strong message, solid direction, and a great cast. As other reviewers have noted, the African continent endured war long before the trade of conflict diamonds became worldwide news, but the fact remains that there are many people in the world who probably didn't, and still don't, know much about it. Blood Diamond attempts to shed light on an important issue, and it did so with elegance and precision. I would definitely recommend it, but would add that warning that it is in no way a light film that you will watch and forget. It's message resonates, and will stay with you for days later. BUt I think that was the point.</p></body></html>

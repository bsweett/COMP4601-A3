<meta name="summary" content="An Icon of the Western Genre"></head><body><p>The third and best installement in Sergio Leone's western trilogy involving the characters of Tuco (Eli Wallach), Setenza a.k.a Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), and Joe Manco/Blondie/The Man with no Name (Clint Eastwood.)  One of the best-known westerns along with its legendary music composed by Enio Morricone.<br /><br />As with its two predecessors, it was the last in a series of westerns that broke the traditional good vs. bad cowboy, sheriff v. desperado, plots and themes that dominated virtually every western film to precede it.  The characters are archetypes to set a particular mood of a land immersed in utter lawlessness.  Although Clint Eastwood's character is the hero, he's hardly a model of virtue as a bounty hunter who catches his fugitives only to save them later to increase the bounty.  Lee Van Cleef's character is the total sociopath who needs to keep up his reputation as a reliable hired killer even if it means killing his own employer. Tuco Benedito Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez is the epidemy of the Mexican desperado: instead of being the stern, cold-blooded Angel Eyes, Tuco is the repulsive yet likable bon vivant bandido who's always emotional; like everyone else, he wants all the gold for himself.  The shifting scenes showing the grimy faces and twitching hands of the gun slingers adds to the tension and mood of the film: sheer survival in a very Wild West.  Slow and detailed camera shots revolve around the characters while Morricone's brilliant brass symphonic arrangements make the audience feel as if they're watching a matador preparing to run his sword through a ferocious snarling bull. All of this is presented through close shots of the twitching eyes, dripping sweat, and nervous hands hovering over the grip of a Peacemaker. The humourous treatment of the characters keeps it as a satirical action-adventure western instead of a drama genre.<br /><br />An excellent film that should be in every western genre lover's collection without exception.  Don't miss watching one of the greatest westerns ever made.</p></body></html>

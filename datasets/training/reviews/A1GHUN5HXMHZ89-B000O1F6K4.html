<meta name="summary" content="Once Upon a El Mariachi Desperado"></head><body><p>Any fan of the previous Anthonio Banderas Mariachi movies should be quite happy. A little more acting this time with some great parts played by Johnny Depp, Salma Hayek, Mickey Rourke, and Willem Defoe. As always it is filled with plenty of action, and testosterone. This is one I plan to add to my set. The other two aren't complete without it. A nice trilogy.</p></body></html>

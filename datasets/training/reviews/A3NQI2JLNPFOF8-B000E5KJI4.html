<meta name="summary" content="Troy"></head><body><p>Ok, not an accurate portrayal of the Illiad, of course....but still fun to watch.  And I liked the nihilism, too.  Really, though, this is probably the best Trojan War adaptation I've seen.  Alot of people are saying that Helen of Troy is much better.  Well, I'd have to disagree...Helen of Troy looks exactly like what it was meant to be: a TV drama.<br /><br />Anyway....Eric Bana is unbelievable in this.  Far better performance than Pitt's.  Unfortunately, I think that his presence in this movie was undermined due to the 'apparent' disappointment of the 'Hulk'.  But with Pitt....well....I like the guy....but I'm going to have to call "bad casting" on this one.  Here's why.  When I see Bad Pitt running around swinging a sword in a dress.....I don't see Achilles....I see Brad Pitt with a sword.  And whereas a Greek warrior would look kinda cool swinging a sword around, Brad Pitt just looks silly.  This is what happens when a celebrity gets shoved in our face too much....he becomes unbelievable in movie roles.  People like Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise will never fully 'transform' into their roles because we'll always see them as the celebrity.<br /><br />By the way...Brian Cox looks just like the real Agememnon.  Don't believe me?  Try searching for an ancient Greek artifact engraved with Agememnon's face (it might have been a death mask).  It looks just like Brian Cox.  I can't help but think that when the casting directors were searching for possible actors, they took one look at a picture of this gold plate and said, "What the....this looks just like Brian Cox!"</p></body></html>

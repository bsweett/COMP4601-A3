<meta name="summary" content="Sodomy, Torture, Rape, and Animal Decapitation"></head><body><p>Geeze.  This review is based solely on the movie.  I did not see the apparent prior version or read the books, but I did not expect this.  Sex -- no problem.  But, explicit sodomy/rape, forced oral sex, torture, animal decapitation, photos of murdered and tortured women and lesbian sex -- I could have done without.  The screams in the sodomy/rape scene were heart-breaking and sickening -- certainly not "entertainment" by the wildest stretch of the word.  I personally do not understand why there were so many positive reviews on this film.<br /><br />My son and I both enjoy Daniel Craig as an actor, and thought the promo looked good. I was surprised he accepted this role.  The movie was 2 hours long or more.  The first 3/4 was very slow.  The last 1/4 was fast-moving and interesting, and saved the film from death.<br /><br />The movie begins with a winter scene in Sweden.  Mikhail (Daniel Craig) loses his savings in a court battle over "inaccurate reporting" as a magazine journalist.  He reported a story without being able to prove it.  Meanwhile, a separate side story gets our attention about an unconventional young girl trying to survive.  She is living off a trust fund and is an exceptional part-time independent investigator. Watching the two stories side-by-side for some time, you wonder how they will eventually come together.  Although Rooney Mara gives an outstanding performance as Lisbeth Salander, the troubled young girl, in my opinion, her abilities are wasted in the violent storyline of this movie.<br /><br />Veteran actor Christopher Plummer requests Craig come to his mansion on the Island in or around Hedestad, where he offers Craig a nice sum to write his memoirs.  (According to the internet, Hedestad is a ficticious place, but if you happen to be traveling to Stockholm, the Stockholm City Museum is currently offering a guided tour that visits real locations that the book mentions.) What Plummer is really asking is for Craig to investigate the murder of 16-year old family-member Harriet, killed many years ago.  Her body was never found.  The Island is all owned by members of the same family, many of which who do not speak to each other.  Craig moves into the guest house on the property and begins to investigate.<br /><br />With the price of movies today, don't waste your money on this flick.  I see that some folks think it was brilliant.  Needless to say, I did not like the overall movie and I offer you my humble opinion as well, and why, so that you can make an educated choice of whether or not you want to see it.  If they had left out the behaviors mentioned above, I would have still only rated it an overall 3 because it was interesting but much of it was very slow.  No, I will not watch it again and I will not buy the video.  I hope you do not take your young children with you if you choose to go to see this movie.</p></body></html>

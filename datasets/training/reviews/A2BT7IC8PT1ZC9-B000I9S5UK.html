<meta name="summary" content="Don't they make good movies anymore?"></head><body><p>Answer: Not many!  It seems that 9 out of 10 movies I watch lately, suck!  This wasn't the worst of the bunch, but it still wasn't that good.  I thought the story to this movie was stupid, and unbelievable.The movie had some decent action here and there, but the fact that 90% of the movie took place in one spot,made it boring.  The only good thing I can really say about this movie was, that the sound quality was very good.  If you have a good home theater system, you'll be impressed with the sound.  Worth a rent I guess, definitely not worth buying.  One final thought, the woman from the Sopranos does not look anything like an Iris, she looks more like a Mary or Tina.</p></body></html>

Oliver Stone, 3 hours) may be simultaneously the weirdest and most compelling movie ever made. It shall be no surprise, then, that I consider it to be simultaneously the best and the worst of cinema.<br /><br />Based on the book by real-life former New Orleans DA and retired Judge Jim Garrison (played by an unusually animated Kevin Costner, and in Stone's unique way of working, the real Garrison plays Chief Justice Earl Warren), this migraine-inducing piecemeal clunker attempts to explain the conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. I've been watching this film over and over since it hit theaters - but I think now's the time for a review ....<br /><br />This film tried so very hard to explain the real cause of that famous "magic bullet" that allegedly changed angles and ended up in pristine condition at the end. Something that many years ago was proved, in a documentary that was hosted either by Tom Brokaw or ... someone. It showed that the bullet wasn't magic: it was the seating arrangement in that weird car of Kennedy's.<br /><br />Stone went with the expos&eacute; of the century, he thought, by demonstrating that the government-as-faceless-monster was responsible for the order to kill President Kennedy. It speaks of Kennedy being an actual communist, of getting in bed with the Russians, everything you'd expect from a criminal trying to justify what he's done. The government is the criminal trying to justify Kennedy's assassination.<br /><br />The Warren Commission is taken to task here, with an endless stream of repulsive gay men (Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones), prostitutes of every stripe (paramount among them is Kevin Bacon), Jack Ruby (Brian Doyle-Murray) and a sadly creepy Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald. What a mess. I still can't explain to you who Jack Lemmon (as Jack Martin) and Ed Asner (as Guy Bannister) were supposed to be ... so let it be in the eyes of the beholder. In fact you'll see everyone here from Sissy Spacek to Walter Matthau to Donald Sutherland to John Candy, like some screwball 1960s comedy.<br /><br />I credit Stone for several things: I remember he fought like a soldier to insert the Zapruder film at the moment of the head-shot. Stone endured what no director has had to endure since D. W. Griffith with his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RFRRMW">Birth Of A Nation</a>. Yet the film has captivating points, among them, Garrison is the only American who has ever brought suit in the assassination of the president.<br /><br />At three hours - and God knows which version you'll be seeing here, I make no promises - this can get under the skin. We know much more now than Stone did back then: a very recent documentary taught me how Oswald could have and did achieve the four shots in the way he did from the book repository. Stone's film should be taken in halves. It's more comfortable that way.<br /><br />Otherwise, I don't know what else I could comment to recommend this movie. It's a thriller, it is entertaining and some of it scared the hell out of me. But then it had few surprises, especially for conspiracy buffs and theorists. The acting (unusually sizzling), the art (they filmed in the actual book depository, right where Oswald stood), the 'taste' (in fact they shot on location whenever possible) are all exquisite; the direction is haphazard and goofy.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, it was Stone who wanted to generate some kind of weird national event with the very making of this highly political film. However, his film did result directly in the passing of a law about government disclosures.<br /><br />I strongly recommend you help yourself back down to earth with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VL7UWY">Peter Jennings Reporting - The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy</a> (a/k/a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001BFDKU">ABC News Presents The Kennedy Assassination - Beyond Conspiracy</a>) and "Unsolved History: JFK ~ Beyond the Magic Bullet" (unavailable now at Amazon, as are all the other "Unsolved History ~ JFK" documentaries). Sadly, Stone did not succeed in exposing/helping to remove rabid psychopaths like Garrison from public offices.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sensational finale!"></head><body><p>The Bride ( Uma Thurman) has exterminated 2 deadly cockroaches and has 3 more to go known only as Elle Driver ( Daryl Hannah), Budd ( Michael Madsen) and of course, former boss Bill ( David Carradine). She sometimes gets memories of being taught by the selfish and powerful Chinese kung-fu master Pai Mei ( Gordon Liu) and searches for her long lost daughter whom has been seperated from her womb for 4 years leading up to a battle between the man who nearly killed her 4 years ago and herself.<br /><br />Simply excellent second part of a 2-part cinematic novel done thoughtfully by masterful filmmaker Quentin Tarantino as he brings his trademark style of movies, action, snappy dialog and humor in many successful ways but less gory than it's precessor.<br /><br />The DVD just like the first movie's DVD has a few extras like Deleted scene, behind the scenes of KB vol. 2 and a look at the premire of KB Vol. 2 with a performance by Robert Rodriguez's CHINGON band and it's picture & Sound are just crystal clear.<br /><br />Add this movie with part 1 to your DVD collection if your a fan of action and cinema itself.</p></body></html>

Secrets also foster a pathological distrust that can turn their keepers and traders into hollow shells." Chris Voynar<br /><br />Matt Damon, plays Edward Wilson, and he becomes the man with no life. His character is based on longtime CIA counterintelligence honcho James Jesus Angleton.  He has little emotion, is suspicious and loyal. He shows us his life from the 'Skulls and Bones' of Yale to The Bay of Pigs and World War II.  The movie, directed by Robert De Niro, shifts from one era to another, and pulls us in to the story. This movie requires alot of attention. I spent alot of time tgrying to discover what clue went with what scene. The film is supberb because of the acting.<br /><br />"A lot of questions: was Soviet power overstated to justify the CIA's existence? Can information gleaned through torture be trusted? And, most pertinent of all: What is the personal price of a life ruled by silence and disinformation? The Good Shepherd doesn't address these issues with Oliver Stone-style accusation of conspiracy. It coolly enlists them in the service of an ambitious story that deftly maneuvers visual clues and character motives. Short on gunplay, its thrills are covert, subtle, even a little sneaky, much like Edward Wilson, the quiet warrior who can't afford to open up." Chris Voynar<br /><br />The CIA as we all guess is shadowy and secretive. Anyone who becomes a part of 'The Company' gives up most of their life. This film shows a small piece of one life, and the drudgery and repetitive issues that crop up time and time again.<br /><br /> Recommended.  prisrob  4-7-07<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5AJQS">The Departed (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>DVD<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305216088">Good Will Hunting (Miramax Collector's Series)</a>DVD<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00023B1LC">The Bourne Identity (Widescreen Extended Edition)</a>DVD</p></body></html>

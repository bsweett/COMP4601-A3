<meta name="summary" content="Noir For the Nineties Now In Blu-Ray!"></head><body><p>I have always been a fan of noir from the early such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0020MMRC0">The Maltese Falcon [Blu-ray</a>] and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNG5">Double Indemnity (Universal Legacy Series)</a> and the more recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UAE7RW">Chinatown (Special Collector's Edition)</a> which this film closely resembles in some parts as it also addresses police corruption in California in the 1900s however this film is unique in and of itself.  The casting of relative unknowns at the time was daring but it paid off with fine performances from Australians Guy Pierce and Russell Crowe.  Kim Basinger fully deserved her Oscar for her work and special mention has to be made for James Cromwell's work too.<br /><br />As for the blu-ray itself while the picture and sound quality aren't reference-grade as far as the best I've ever seen in 1080p they are still very good and together with the excellent special feature documentaries does make this a great way to view a true film classic.<br /><br />Recommended for all fans of great film!</p></body></html>

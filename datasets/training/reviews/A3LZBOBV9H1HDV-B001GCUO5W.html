<meta name="summary" content=""Shutter Island" is excellent!"></head><body><p>"Shutter Island" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Two U.S. marshals, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, are summoned to a remote and barren island off the coast of Massachusetts to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a murderess from the island's fortress-like hospital for the criminally insane.<br /><br />The cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio (in his fourth go-round with Scorsese) (as Teddy Daniels) is excellent! The directing by Martin Scorsese (who also produced) (who won an Oscar for his work on "The Departed" (2006) is excellent! The screenplay (based on Dennis Lehane's novel, he also executive produced) by Laeta Kalogridis (who also executive produced) (who also did the screenplay to "Night Watch" (2004) & the upcoming "Battle Angel" (2011), story and screenplay to "Alexander" (2004), she also executive produced "Avatar" (2009) is excellent!<br /><br />The cinematography by Robert Richardson (who also did the cinematography, recently, to "Inglourious Basterds" (2009, for which he is nominated for an Oscar for his work), he also done Scorsese's "Casino" (1995), "Bringing Out The Dead" (1999), "The Aviator" (2004, for which he won an Oscar for his work) & "Shine A Light" (2008), he also did the cinematography to "JFK" (1991, for which he won an Oscar for his work) is excellent! The film editing by Thelma Schoonmaker (who also did the film editing to Scorsese's films since "Raging Bull" (1980, for which she won an Oscar), she also won Oscars for her work on "The Aviator" & "The Departed") is excellent! The casting by Ellen Lewis (who also did the casting to Scorsese's films since "Goodfellas" (1990) is excellent! The production design by Dante Ferretti (who also did the production design to "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street" (2007) & "The Aviator", for which he won Oscars for his work, he also done Scorsese's "The Age Of Innocence" (1993), "Casino", "Kundun" (1997), "Bringing Out The Dead" & "Gangs Of New York" (2002) is excellent! The art direction by Max Biscoe, Robert Guerra (who also did the art direction to "Bringing Out The Dead" & "The Aviator"), Christina Ann Wilson (who also did the art direction to the upcoming "Alice In Wonderland" (2010) is excellent! The set decoration by Francesca Lo Schiavo (who also did the set decoration to "Kundun", "Gangs Of New York", "The Aviator" & "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street", for which she won Oscars for her work) is excellent! The costume design by Sandy Powell (who also did the costume design to "The Aviator" & "Shakespeare In Love" (1998), for which she won Oscars for her work, she also did the costume design to "Gangs Of New York" & "The Departed") is excellent!<br /><br />This is an excellent mystery-thriller that's different than most mystery-thrillers out there. This is another excellent film that was adapted from a Dennis Lehane novel. This is another hit for Scorsese & DiCaprio.</p></body></html>

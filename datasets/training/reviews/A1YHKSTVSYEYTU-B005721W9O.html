<meta name="summary" content="I LOVE THIS MOVIE"></head><body><p>Galaxy Quest, as I'm sure everybody already knows, is a send up of Star Trek. Tim Allen is cast in the William Shatner role, Sigourney weaver is the Uhura of the show and a dead pan Alan Rickman is the Leonard Nimoy of Galaxy Quest. Having had their show cancelled several years previously the cast of the now defunct Galaxy Quest make their living by doing personal appearances at conventions organised by their all too obsessive fan club. However their careers are given a new lease of life, and a definite change of direction, when they are enlisted by some very hapless (but genuine) aliens to assist them in fighting a war against a ruthless enemy who has been terrorising their `people'. The unfortunate ET's however do not realise that Galaxy Quest is merely a TV show and instead believe that each episode is a historical document. From this false belief the unfortunately dim-witted and naive aliens have modelled their whole ethical system on the show and created an exact replica of the Galaxy Quest star-ship to assist them in their quest for survival. <p>I love Galaxy Quest. There I said it. I think it is one of the funniest yet most under appreciated movies of the last few years. I own it on DVD, yet every time it is on satellite TV I still end up watching it again and again and laughing again and again. To put this in perspective I'm not even a great fan of comedies, I'm not even a great fan of Tim Allen or Sigourney Weaver (although they are both decent actors) but this movie just tickles me pink and has me giggling like a kid every time I watch it.<p>This movie is simply a joy. Unlike many spoofs it doesn't over egg the mix. It is told straight and there are no nudge nudge wink wink asides to the camera. Every joke pretty much hits its mark and there is so much fine observational humour that it perhaps requires a couple of viewings to completely appreciate its subtleties. Galaxy Quest is in many ways the sci-fi equivalent to the Scream movies, in that it sends up all the old clich&eacute;s of sci-fi movies and of course in particular, Star Trek. That said it is not done in a disrespectful manner. I grew up with the original Star Trek and as an adult have enjoyed The Next Generation immensely, which definitely added to my viewing pleasure of Galaxy Quest, which is absolutely choc-full of witty knowing dialogue. Much of the credit for this must go to the invention of writers David Howard and Robert Gordon for what is obviously an affectionate and extremely clever and knowledgeable spoof. Kudos also to Director Dean Parisot for his subtle direction and decision to play the movie straight. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, in fact the whole cast are just great. Galaxy Quest never misses a beat and I highly recommend it!<br />Five stars.</p></body></html>

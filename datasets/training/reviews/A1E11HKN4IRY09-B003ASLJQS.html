<meta name="summary" content="Mysically overrated."></head><body><p>MYSTIC RIVER is a well made, depressing, and genuinely run-of-the-mill drama that yet again shows the wide range of crying, weeping, and sobbing SEAN PENN is always capable of.  Chock full of unsympathetic characters and predictable plot arcs, this flick is way overrated.  Which should suffice for fans of PENN, who is the most overrated actor in hollywood today.  He and the supporting cast do a decent job of bringing their characters to life, but the story doesn't give you a chance to really like any of them.  CLINT EASTWOOD's direction is assured if not inspired and the end of the picture drags on for quite some time.  Maybe I expected more from MYSTIC RIVER due to the high praise it recieved, but as a cinematic experience it's just plain there.</p></body></html>

A group of middle schoolers works on a Super 8 film in the early 80s but then witnesses a train accident and finds out about an alien as well.  There is some drama regarding the death of one young boy's mother at a factory and a girl whose dad worked in the same place; I will not ruin it here by telling you.  But it gives the movie a lot of heart; it is not just another invader from another planet movie.</p></body></html>

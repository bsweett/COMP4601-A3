It was like I was watching it again for the very first time. She absolutely loves this film and so do I.<br /><br />I was 11 when this movie came out, so I really could relate with the kids in the film. I grew up in that same generation, in middle-class suburbia, USA, had Star Wars toys, rode bikes with my friends, etc. Watching this film brought it all back to me again and reminded me of a time in my life when the world was much bigger and life was a lot simpler. It's amazing how age can take the innocence away from you, but this movie is the perfect way to get it back, even if just for 2 hours.<br /><br />Even though I had seen the movie and knew what was going to happen, I still cried like a baby when E.T. "died" and when he finally went home. The scene at the very end when the spaceship leaves a rainbow in its wake and you see the reactions of the kids and the adults as the ship disappears will make your heart burst and leave you weeping like a child.<br /><br />Most of the naysayers of this film are definitely in the minority. This film is sheer brilliance and Spielberg has forged himself a place in history by directing it. The story, the acting, the music, the cinematography are all perfectly executed. It is a film that can be enjoyed by all ages.<br /><br />One pet peeve, though. The 2002 version is a sell-out. The digital "upgrading" of some of the effects were well-done and appreciated, but replacing guns with walkie-talkies is just plain stupid. While I was watcing the 2002 version, I thought to myself, "That's a strange way to hold a walkie-talkie." Then I realized that in the original version, it was a gun, not a radio.<br /><br />I was very disappointed that Spielberg would feel pressured to alter this work of genius just because of political correctness. Police and government agents carry guns. They sometimes even use them to hurt or kill others. It's a fact of life. If that fact was too much for kids to handle, why didn't Spielberg edit out the whole part where E.T. dies? That's a cold, hard fact of life as well. If you're gonna go PC, why not go all the way? Why? Because doing so would have totally eradicated the emotional impact of the film and it would never have become such a huge hit. What can I say? Money talks; another cold, hard fact of life.<br /><br />Enough ranting. Please, purchase this DVD. Not only is it a masterful work of movie-making, not only is it a piece of cinema history, you will actually ENJOY it! It's one of those movies you can actually enjoy with the whole family.<br /><br />Priceless, timeless, ageless, E.T. has suspense, action, humor, and most importantly, a message of love and friendship that transcends all boundaries. What else do you need from a film?</p></body></html>

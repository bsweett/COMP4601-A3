<meta name="summary" content="Ambitious sci-fi grounded by a common storyline"></head><body><p>Setting aside the technical wizadry that makes "Aeon Flux" watchable, this is an ambitious science fiction story that is grounded by its reliance on oppression as its overarching theme. This is the same thing that happened with similar sci-fi flicks including "The Island" and "V For Vendetta" -- they all revolve around futuristic societies where the action takes place after war or other calamity.<br /><br />In "Aeon Flux" the society is set in 2415 after a plague has taken all but 5 million residents (who all seem beautiful and able to speak English.) They reside inside a walled society that separates them from a world nature has taken over -- similar to "The Island", where all the inhabitants tried their best to get to the island without knowing they were stuck inside a tiny little world.<br /><br />Star Charlize Theron is magnificent in the James Bond-ish lead role as a member of the underground fighting to overthrow the leadership -- not unlike the Zorro-like character in "V For Vendetta" whose goal was to topple the totalitarian government in place in England.<br /><br />Theron gets an assignment to assassinate a member of the ruling party and the action takes a decided turn in another direction. She recalls a previous life with this guy and doesn't kill him. She ends up in prison, escapes, kills some people, meets him again, and finds out more about their collective past -- all in the time it took my wife to go to the bathoroom!<br /><br />At this point the story changes changes and, without disclosing much, the notion of cloning begins to play a major role. This separates those that want to go backward to the old way (revolutionaries) from those that want to keep things the way they are now (ruling party). I don't recall what happened at the end of the flick so I can't spoil that for you.<br /><br />"Aeon Flux" has many fine and involving moments of action and imaginative scenes, has many wonderful sets, is marvelously lit, and benefits from a fine actress in the lead role whose outfits will keep male viewers attached to the screen if not to the storyline. That last thing, the story, becomes a bit bizarre and borders on incoherence once or twice during the telling of the story, so expect to be confused on occasion.<br /><br />The bottom line: "Aeon Flux" is a visual treat and somewhat entertaining as 21st century sci-fi with all its technical details in place. It is neither a film for the ages nor in any way individual compared to other movies of its type that have been made in recent years. But, considering the original was a cartoon, this is an improvement over that.</p></body></html>

Imagine further that a couple of scientists get invited to look over the park before it opens. Imagine as a final step that the visitors, along with some kids, are on a tour of the park when a saboteur brings down the security systems and the giant monsters are let loose. The only thing left is the tremendous technical challenges to make all of these imaginings come to pass. Spielberg pulls it all off.<br /><br />It is a fight for survival when they are caught in the park when the power goes down. The only thing the people have going for them is their intelligence. Unfortunately, some of the dinosaurs are intelligent themselves. They can learn and they are hungry. They are also hacked off at being cooped up. Everyone has to run for it.<br /><br />The story presented in this film is interesting and fun to watch. Just as interesting and fascinating in its own right is watching these flights of fancy come to life on the screen. The dinosaur footage is worth the price of admission all by itself. It is truly miraculous. The dinosaurs are the real stars of this show. The excellent performances by all the rest of the cast are just the icing on the cake.<br /><br />This version of the DVD has a "Making Of" featurette.  This too is worth the admission.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A First-Rate Horror/Comedy.  A Great Viewing Experience."></head><body><p>Two American's are attacked by a massive beast one dark, foggy night while back-packing in the English moors. One is killed, the other is sent to the hospital. David, the survivor, is then plagued by disturbing, violent nightmares brought on by his near death experience. Soon his dead friend begins re-appearing (in various stages of decomposition) informing David that they were attacked by a werewolf and if he doesn't kill himself soon, he will become one himself and will be responsible for many deaths. David does not believe his dead chum and dismisses his claims as rubbish. That is of course until that night when things start to get a little hairy.<br /><br />Next to "The Howling", this werewolf spectacle is one of my favourite all time horror movies. It's an odd mixture of horror and humour. So even if you hate "fright" films, you may find something to like here. The film's cast is first rate. It doesn't have any world famous superstars but the actors give good performances throughout. Jenny Agutter, the werewolf's love interest, is lovely to look at while Griffen Dunne is hysterical as the walking dead friend given the difficult task of tormenting his buddy. The lead actor, David Naughton is also excellent. His portrayal of the tormented David is touching. But despite the film's impressive cast, the real reason to see this film is for its ingenious makeup effects. No CGI monsters here folks, instead the viewer is rewarded with several creative scenes of grotesque imagery. The transformation scene is especially spellbinding. It qualifies as the greatest werewolf transformation scene ever screened. The beast is not clearly shown until the final frames of the film so during those earlier attack scenes, the camera acts as the beast's eyes and the overall effect is chilling (The subway scene never fails to send chills up my spine). This picture's major highlight is its spectacular climax. Once the beast is unleashed upon the people of London, all hell breaks loose. There are car crashes, bus crashes, people being run over by cars. It's wonderfully chaotic and violent.<br /><br />I don't know which film I like better, this one or "The Howling". They're both outstanding horror films but despite the werewolf theme, they are different. "The Howling" takes place in a rural setting while "Werewolf In London" takes place in an urban one. In my opinion, "The Howling" is darker, more frightening, "Werewolf In London" is funnier but gorier. The transformation scenes also differ. Dante's film is less spectacular but nastier, more bone-chilling and the werewolves look more like wolves and stand upright. The beast in "London" walks on all fours resembling a massive, mutated dog. I urge the viewer to watch both films and decide for themselves which they like better.<br /><br />"An American Werewolf In London" is a classic and it's highly recommended. It's tongue-and-cheek horror done splendidly with one of the fiercest werewolves ever captured on film. Enjoy!<br /><br />4.5 out of 5.</p></body></html>

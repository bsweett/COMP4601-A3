<meta name="summary" content="Ending Still Needs Work"></head><body><p>After seeing High Tension you start to think why people were making such a big deal about Hostel because this movie goes crazy with the gore. The film was going in a good direction until the amazing but horrible end. The ending is lazy and you'll see what I mean when you see it. Basically your being leaded to believe one thing and that belief is ripped right from under you when they switch everything up. They give the story away very obviously in the beginning and I think they thought nobody was going to notice it. I'll tell you what your basically getting in this film, your getting gore, not as much high tension as they say it will give you, and a half done story that definitely has been done before.</p></body></html>

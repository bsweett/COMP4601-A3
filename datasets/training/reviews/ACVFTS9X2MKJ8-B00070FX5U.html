<meta name="summary" content="As a Blu-Ray disc, this film is the least impressive transition to Hi-Def of the 20 Blu-Ray discs that I've watched so far..."></head><body><p>This one was a waste of money.  It's no better than the DVD.  I promise you.  This realization is both good news and bad news for me.  The bad news is that I expected it to look alot better than it does as a Blu-Ray disc.  The good news is that I really don't think that I will have to replace many of my regular DVD's that I already feel look very good as they are.  So, I'm going to be spending alot less money on replacing my DVD's than I had at first thought.<br /><br />You know, my previous Samsung Progressive scan DVD player with the HDMI hook-up option, really made my old DVD's look better than my first DVD player.  So, if your DVD player has the HDMI hook-up, you're going to find that replacing your DVD's with Blu-Ray may not impress you with any serious visual improvements.  Although, I have discovered that some Blu-Ray releases have shown a greater re-mastering effort, but only because the DVD version wasn't mastered very well in the first place.  But, I've got some great looking DVD's.  I don't think it will be necessary to replace them with Blu-Ray unless they sell for maybe $10 or less.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a movie that I have on DVD that I thought would probably look better on Blu-ray Hi-Definition, but it was certainly not one of the first Blu-Ray discs that I ran out to buy.  I made an expense vow that I plan to stick to.  I will only replace my absolute favorite movies (which are about 60 of my 500+ movies) at any price under $30.  But, anything else that I already have on DVD that's not incredibly fantastic, I may only buy the new Blu-ray version if it's $9.99 or less.  I have to initiate a discipline for myself so I don't go wasting my money on replacing movies that I'll just watch again, once more maybe, and then have it just sit on my DVD shelf as a part of a proud collection that may never be watched again anytime soon.<br /><br />I've got a Blu-Ray player now, and I doubt I'll ever buy another regular DVD again, but, I won't go crazy replacing my regular DVD's just because a Blu-Ray version is available.  If I were younger, I might.  But, I feel that I'm older and getting wiser with every Blu-Ray disc that I watch.</p></body></html>

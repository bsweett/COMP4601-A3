<meta name="summary" content="The Good Shepherd is indeed good -- but far from great"></head><body><p>Ambitious, star-studded, and lengthy, The Good Shepherd purports to give us a sense of how the CIA operated during the Cold War and how it affected those who devoted themselves to the cause.  So it is that, via a series of flashbacks, we meet an intelligent young Yale student named Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), watch as he is recruited into the service of American intelligence, joins the O.S.S. during WWII, helps found the nascent CIA in the 1950s, and goes about doing the thankless, extremely difficult job of keeping America safe through foreign crises, particularly those involving Castro's Cuba in the 1960s.  It's not an expose on the CIA - which it actually deals with quite even-handedly, especially in today's day and age - as it principally focuses on the personal story of this one individual and what might be called his dehumanization at the hands of his sometimes sinister career.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is a major (but not fatal) flaw at the very heart of the film.  Obviously, a man in Edward Wilson's position must be a cold and calculating man, but his characterization ventures far beyond stoic into the realms of the robotic.  Even the personal glimpses intended to get us past the emotional wall that defines him lack insight and feeling.  We see through his eyes, but we never really get a sense of his inward self.  I also had a problem seeing Wilson as the experienced, upper level CIA man he became because no effort seemed to go in to making Matt Damon appear any older as his character aged; he looks the same in the 1960s as he did in 1939.  Come on, put a few grey hairs in there or something; it takes more than a fedora to make me believe he's a quarter of a century older.  Damon just never looks the part of an older Edward Wilson, and that really impacted - and not in a good way - my perspective of the entire movie.  Additionally, even though this is not a factual account of CIA history, the film's attempt to deflect any blame from John F. Kennedy for refusing to grant air support to the otherwise sitting ducks storming the beaches at the Bay of Pigs really rubbed me the wrong way.<br /><br />I think it helps to have some knowledge of the historical and political background of events touched upon in this movie, especially the dark stain that is the Bay of Pigs fiasco.  That is really the lynchpin of the film's story, as one of the reasons for the failure slowly causes Wilson's personal and private lives to collide and truly test his mettle - with more than a little help from the helping hands of a formidable KGB intelligence officer.  What should be an excruciatingly painful decision dredges up virtually no emotion in the man, however - although the same can't be said of Wilson's sometimes boisterous wife (Angelina Jolie).  The ending doesn't pack much of a punch either, further pointing out the film's quite obvious deficiencies in character development.  Personally, I found the movie pretty interesting throughout, but that was largely because of my interest in intelligence operations and Cold War history.  If you could care less about those subjects, you probably won't enjoy the movie at all because it simply fails to forge any kind of emotional bond between you and the characters.</p></body></html>

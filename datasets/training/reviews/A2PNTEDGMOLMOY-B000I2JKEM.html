<meta name="summary" content="Another Burton flick that demands repeat viewings; lyrics a bit muddled"></head><body><p>Tim Burton makes some of the richest and most detailed films today - perhaps his only competitor is Baz Luhrmann of "Moulin Rouge" and "Romeo + Juliet" fame.  Burton loves to dabble in the corners, creating mood and invariably a lot of humor with his deft touch.<br /><br />Stop-motion animation serves as the ideal tool for the detail-oriented filmmaker -- this type of filmmaking takes tremendous patience, but it rewards the creative filmmaker with countless opportunities to find room for additional notes in a complex score.  Not for nothing are Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas" and "James and the Giant Peach" such popular DVDs -- adults and kids (over a certain age) can watch them numerous times and never get tired.<br /><br />"The Corpse Bride" allows Burton's gallows humor to run wild.  I'll spare you the plot details, which you can get in many of the other reviews.  I merely recommend that you look out for the little details that make the movie so rich, such as a reunited husband and wife blowing smokehearts instead of smokerings after they get reunited, or the clever use of different color schemes to separate the land of the living from the land of the dead . . . and not in the way you'd expect.<br /><br />Burton once again works with Danny Elfman, whose musical tastes are as refined and twisted as Burton's sensibility.  Elfman's music fits the movie perfectly, but if I have a quibble with "Corpse Bride," it's the same one that I had with "The Nightmare Before Christmas" -- some of the lyrics are so garbled that I can't understand them.  Maybe it's my shoddy TV, but there you go.  It's too bad, 'cause I could hear the majority of the lyrics, and they were fine.<br /><br />If you are exhausted by kiddie fare of a PC Disney nature, you must check this movie out.  It's probably a little dark for some kids, so be careful.</p></body></html>

Order of the Phoenix is too short and leaves out a little bit too much. Make that way, WAY too much by serious fans of the books, but when isn't that the case? At times the viewer is not provided with background and significant details which would make the story more interesting and sensible. All of these movies seem to made with an assumption that everyone has read the book. This movie should have included more and that it was shorter running than previous adaptations is inexcusable and the wrong decision by the filmmakers. This fifth story leaves you eager for six and seven while making many people concerned about the choice of David Yates (director of Phoenix) to be director of all three. However, what is very promising is Yates's desire to do the seventh and last book as two seperate films in order to do justice to the story.<br /><br />I had a problem with the bluish tint seen in much of the movie and that sort of digitale film look, I guess you could call it. Hagrid's giant half-brother was just sad. I mean, how could they accept that result? It's acceptable by mid-90s standards. Maybe they figured people wouldn't care.<br /><br />There are a few things that stand out in this movie, however.<br /><br />I liked the Department of Mysteries. You wondered what it would look like on the screen and it did not disappoint. Dolores Umbridge is evil incarnate. She is one of the most horrible, disgusting, unlikable, disturbing villains I've ever seen. Most of the time villains, particularly in the movies, are famous for having the best lines and great style. They have a stricking apperance and often more personality and charisma than the heros. Not the case with Dolores Umbridge. She has none of this going for her. No great lines but some slightly memorable ones like she confesses, "You know, I really hate children." That squeaky voice, the knit pink oufit, and torturing kids... It's Big Brother in pink with a bad hair-do as your worst nightmare teacher from grade school and "a cross between Margaret Thatcher and Hyacinth Bucket"(The Daily Mall). Well, truth is she is not as horrible as Margaret Thatcher. All the performances are good. Gary Oldman is great as Sirius Black as is Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. She is the embodiment of the twisted, evil, cackling witch.<br /><br />The obvious highlight and climax of Order of the Phoenix is the battle at the Ministry culminating in the epic duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort. Out of all the wizard fights I've seen portrayed in the movies, this one was the most impressive. It was fierce and conveyed the two masters awesome abilities without seeming cartoonish or leaving you feeling like your favorite character was short changed. (I umm, have a couple movies in mind here. You guess what they are.)</p></body></html>

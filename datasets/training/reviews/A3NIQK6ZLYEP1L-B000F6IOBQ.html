It turns out he wishes to release his brother, William, the first of the lycans.  The movie traces the start of the war between the vampires and werewolves.  But, outside of the wild Williams, we don't have any lycan characters.  Also, the fact that Selene was betrayed by her own kind should not be a shock - we became aware of that in the last film.  And how is killing the immortal bothers part of her revenge?  As you can guess I am somewhat disappointed with the second movie and while I love Kate Beckinsale as an actor and as a vampire, that wasn't enough to save this film.  Lots of star power and a good mixture of special effects but the story was just too badly made to hold up.  In other words, no story, lots of action.  Get the popcorn and turn off the mind.</p></body></html>

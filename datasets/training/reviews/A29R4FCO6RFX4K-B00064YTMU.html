<meta name="summary" content="Michael Mann's best film to date"></head><body><p>Michael Mann has proved to be a consistently impressive source of film-making over the last quarter century. Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans, Heat and The Insider show him at his most versatile and entertaining and are modern classics in their own right. Despite his efforts, he has not enjoyed the amount of box-office success and recognition he deserves. Collateral, his latest project, made great strides in finally brining Mann to the forefront of modern cinematic directors. Not only is it his most accessible film to date, it strongly showcases his greatest strength of creating an engaging storyline with engaging characters. The two leads are perfectly cast, with Cruise going drastically against type as the remorseless Vincent and Foxx matching him stride for stride as the helpless Max.<br /><br />The two share a unique, strained bond that makes their final showdown both inevitable and gripping. Above it all, Mann's unmistakable flair for his craft shines through. In the hands of a less experienced director, Collateral would have been another run-of-the-mill clich&eacute;d action vehicle. Thanks to the careful hand of Mann and the pitch perfect performances from Cruise and Foxx, it rises above the normal expectations of the genre and comes through as a fresh and original thrill ride. It's truly one of the year's best.</p></body></html>

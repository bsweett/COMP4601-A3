You could be in a shopping mall somewhere and you hear that low-pitched string instrument playing its evil lament... Images of a ravenous shark devouring unsuspecting swimmers are going to be evoked.<br /><br />The movie is timeless and is a prime example of a good scare without being TOO bloody. For its time, of course, this was a rather gory film, but by today's standards (With Scream and Saw and all those movies) this one is tame by comparison.<br /><br />But blood and guts aside, this movie is just downright frightening!<br /><br />Like the tagline says... "Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water..."<br /><br />There's nothing like the feeling of helplessness and JAWS plays on that feeling of helplessness all too well!<br /><br />Not really sure there is anything on this disk that makes it worth a "special edition" but the movie itself is worth the price I paid!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding movie!"></head><body><p>Four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sent to live with the professor in a mansion. When they're playing hide and seek, they discover a world that they never thought existed. Here we enter Narnia-where mythical creatures talk and where a cruel white witch reigns over the land. She has a spell to keep it always winter-but never Christmas. No one can defeat the white witch. Except-there is a prophecy- that if 2 sons of Adam and 2 daughters of Eve sit at the throne at Cair Paravel, the white witch will be defeated. Can it be done? The only hope Narnia has is for the four children to sit at the throne. Led by Aslan-the creator of the land-who will come out victorious?<br /><br />  I really enjoyed watching this movie. Not only is it full of great special effects and plenty of action, but it's filled with lots of symbolism. The books are written by C.S Lewis-a Christian author. In his books Lewis put in tons and tons of symbolism. And the movie follows it.<br /><br />  Now for the effects. This movie is chalkfull of effects. The Lion-Aslan actually looks real compared to the earlier Narnia movies. The battle sequence is great. The scenery is great, too. (it was filmed in New Zealand) So if you like action and adventure, and have read the books-then step into Narnia-where everything comes to life!</p></body></html>

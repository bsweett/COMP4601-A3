The fact that this legendary serial-murderer was never caught has always brought chills. FROM HELL takes some theories about the case, mixes them w/ facts, and adds a bleak air of dread and doom. Johnny Depp (Sleepy Hollow, Ed Wood, The Ninth Gate, Sweeny Todd) plays an opium-addicted police inspector, drawn into the action due to his ability to "see" certain future events in his dreams. Heather Graham is the sweet yet tough prostitute, Mary Kelly, who assists in the investigation. Ian Holm (Alien, Brazil, The Fifth Element, Lord Of The Rings) plays a kindly old doctor w/ extremely valuable information. Thick w/ symbology, conspiracy, and mystery, FROM HELL plays (somewhat) like a  Sherlock Holmes story, w/ elements of horror sewn in. This is a great movie for Depp fanatics, as he comes through once again. Robbie Coltrane (Harry Potter And The...) is wonderfully low-key in his Watson-esque role as Depp's assistant. Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Futuristic take on fertility"></head><body><p>It is England 2027 and for some unexplained reason, no children were born in 18 years in that country.  Women can no longer conceive and there are no more children playing around.  As world is getting older, it is not getting wiser.  There are terrorist groups, fractions fighing for immigrants rights to enter England, there are militant groups fighing for their political survival.  In a middle of all that misery and fright, Fuji woman is pregnant to everyone's bewilderment.  No one knows who the father is but that does not seem to matter as this young mother is determined to deliver her child and protect it.  There are groups that wish to profit from this event.  For them the birth of the child first time in 18 years is a political statement, particularly since mother is of non-British descent.  This is political, cultural and social revolution ignited by the new life of a baby girl.<br />I have never found more amuzing pothead as that portrayed by Michael Caine in this film.  Julianne Moore is a mother whose child is snatched from her by his untimely death.  In her grief she turns to political activism, terrorism and her own inevitable death ironically caused by her own peers.  Clive Owen is heartbroken father, husband of Moore's character, whose grief leads him to apathy towards life, alchoholism and determination to do whatever it takes in order to protect the innocent child.  He is surrogate father to a newborn girl whose mere existance is a miracle that stands on its own.<br />Powerful, touching and unapologetic.  Just what one would expect from talented director like Cuaron.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than The Sixth Sense!!"></head><body><p>David Dunn ( Bruce Willis) is the sole survivor of a massive train wreck, and does not even suffer a single scratch. Elajah Price ( Samuel L Jackson)has a condition that leaves his bones extremely vulnerable to breaking and develops the nickname &quot;Mr. Glass&quot;. He is also a comic book specialist. His theory is that comic book heroes walk the earth, and due to the recent events, Elajah suspects that David is one of them. The theory is based on the spectrum of life. At one end is Elajah who is incredibly weak and extremely vulnerable. At the other end is someone who is extremely strong and invulnerable. At first David refuses to believe. But Elajah soon convinces David to look into his past. David soon discovers that he has never been sick, never been injured, has exceptional strength, and possesses a unique gift that others don't.... <p>M. Night Shyamalan made one of the most popular horror films in history with &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. But in my opinion, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; is his best film and extremely underrated. While people often criticize this film for being too slow, and hard to understand, it still continues to be one of my favorite films. The fact that the films move slowly, is what gives the film its brilliance. The events unfold at a pace that really lets you soak in the story and what the characters are going through. The story succeeds on five different levels. The first being the trouble with David's job as a security guard and his fight to find his place in the world. The second is the trouble with his marriage, and David's relationship with his wife Audrey ( Robin Wright Penn).The third is the endless need to proove Elajah's theory wrong. The fourth is with David's son Joseph ( Spencer Treat Clark) and how he thinks his dad is a hero. The fifth being what David does with his life, after he finds the truth. All of these aspects are blended together beautifully to create a well rounded story. M. Night Shyamalan is also known for his endings. The ending to &quot;Unbreakable&quot; will blow you away and is extremely shocking! Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson, Spencer Treat Clark, and Robin Wright Penn are all spectacular in their roles. Each bring an important part to the story and are equally captivating. Finally, the camera work, set designs, and use of color are amazing, and really bring the story to life. <p>The VISTA SERIES DVD however, might be the thing of all. The extras are out of this world. They really let you see the film in a whole new light. You get additional scenes, a behind the scenes documentary, and much much more. This is definately a must own</p></body></html>

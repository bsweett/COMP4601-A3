<meta name="summary" content="Too slow for a revenge flick; fast forward to the revenge"></head><body><p>It's a slow burn for the first half, and it's half an hour too long, although when it kicks into revenge mode it gets more satisfying - if you can stomach people losing digits and such. An interesting challenge to opponents of the death penalty, if nothing else. Good performances all round. Weird captioning thingy going on (you'll see).<br /><br />Much too slow and ponderous, but maybe this movie'll give Mexico a black eye regarding its corruption and kidnapping rackets. It's hard to believe Mexico City cooperated in the making of this movie.</p></body></html>

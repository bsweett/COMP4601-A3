<meta name="summary" content="An adult Christmas movie"></head><body><p>This is a terrific movie for Christmas for those wanting the seasonal themes without the specificity.  Set in London, the film has all the appearances of one of those holiday movies we see several times a year (New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day) and in fact is.  The difference is that this one is well done.  The music alone (no not Christmas carols) is worth the price of admission (or purchase or rental).  Several stories evolve at the same time.  The characters are loosely connected in some way, although it isn't all that evident for a while.  In fact if there is a dig at the film it may be that there are too many story lines.<br /><br />Director and writer Richard Curtis assembles a cast that Robert Altman would have been proud of.  Liam Neeson is a recent widower raising his step-son.  Hugh Grant is the recently elected British Prime Minister, single but looking.  Keira Knightley is a new bride who may have married the wrong man.  Andrew Lincoln (TV's "Walking Dead") may be the right man.  Bill Nighy is hilarious as an aging rock star trying again with a Christmas twist on an old song.  Laura Linney is a spinster-like office employee longing over a co-worker but obligated to care for an institutionalized brother.  Emma Thompson is the wife of an executive (Alan Rickman) who may be cheating on her.  Kris Marshall is the hound dog Brit who can't get a date so decides to go to Wisconsin (!) where he's sure he can find plenty of women who will love his accent.  He does!  They are Shannon Elizabeth, January Jones, Elisha Cuthbert, Denise Richards and Ivana Milicevic.  There is the couple whose job is too "stand in" for actors in a porn film and eventually fall in love.  Finally, there is Colin Firth, a writer who falls for his housekeeper (Lucia Moniz) who doesn't speak English.<br /><br />I know this all sounds so convoluted, but it works.  The writing is crisp and funny.  The film is sweet and moving at times.  There is humor, heartbreak and romance.  I'm also glad to see that the filmmakers and studio kept the "R" rating rather than excise some of the more titillating scenes and change the language.  Well done.  Merry Christmas!</p></body></html>

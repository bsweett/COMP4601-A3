<meta name="summary" content="Whitaker shines as the late political despot!!!"></head><body><p>Frightening yet captivating, Forest Whitaker appears larger than life in a role that he was destined to play, that of Ugandan dictator Ida Amin.  Possessing the imposing physical stature of the African leader, Whitaker effectively delivers as the man that brought terror and death to thousands of his countrymen as he claimed to bring "independence" to his nation.  As an actor that has portrayed characters of quiet dignity in the past, Whitaker pulls out all the stops and is deserving of all the accolades heaped upon him for his performance.<br /><br />Besides Whitaker's bravura acting, the film boasts fine work from fellow cast mates James McAvoy as Amin's idealistic yet naive personal physician, Kerry Washington as the dictator's third wife, Simon McBurney as an Englishman that truly understands the dictator's true nature, and David Oyelowo as an Ugandan doctor with hopes for his country despite the totalitarian nature of its leader.  It's good to see Gillian Anderson, late of "The X-Files" in a supporting role, though brief.<br /><br />Director Kevin MacDonald keeps the pace brisk.  Although there are some slow passages, Whitaker's riveting presence, along with Alex Heffes's tense score, makes this one truly one of the best of 2006.</p></body></html>

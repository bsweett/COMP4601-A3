<meta name="summary" content="About half as good as the first one..."></head><body><p>...not surprising since there's a different director---Paul Greengrass isn't bad, he just isn't anywhere as good as Doug Lyman, who did "The Bourene Identity."<br /><br />Lyman's film flowed effortlessly and seamlessly...it was difficult to immediately recognize the standard plot structure, e.g. "Oh, this is Act One, and oh, now we're moving into Act Two, and now this is the clean resolution of Act Three."  Unlike the first Bourne movie, there are a few slow spots here, and killing off Franka Potente during the first ten minutes of the film most DEFINITELY doesn't help matters whatsoever.<br /><br />In fact, this film is pretty much painting-by-numbers: we know full well that Bourne is going to be out to avenge his oh-so-cute German babe, and that again he is being framed for something he didn't do but that he will again prevail agaisnt all odds.  Even the fight scenes (there's only one really major one) are weak, and when we see him escape half of the Berlin police force by climbing up the side of a building yet AGAIN it's hard not to make another beer run.  While in some respects more spectacularly filmed due to Greengrass's documentary-making background than the one in the first film (through Paris), the Big Car Chase through the streets of Moscow also feels rehashed.<br /><br />Then there is the penultimate BIG DRAMATIC SCENE in which Bourne apologizes to one of his past victims...dialogue, acting, and camera are all wrong, and it's hard not to feel sorry for Matt Damon being stretched far beyond his limited abilities as an actor.<br /><br />If such things above don't bother you, chances are you'll enjoy this movie just fine.  Joan Allen easily has the best screen presence in this film and is a pleasure to watch.  This DVD is very well-stocked with all kinds of bonus features, so if you liked this film in the cinema it would probably be worth owning.<br /><br />Me personally, Netflixing it once was enough.</p></body></html>

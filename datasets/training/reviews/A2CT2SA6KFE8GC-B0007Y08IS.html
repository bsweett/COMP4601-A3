On the positive side I liked how politically incorrect it was and how anti-Hollywood as well.  Parker and Stone can also be given marks for originality by the whole theme of the movie which is a spoof of action movies using marionettes a la Gerry Anderson.  The bad side is the same thing that made the South Park movie disappointing.  The fact that they milk one joke over and over again for 90 minutes.  In South Park it was cutesy cartoons swearing, in Team America it's puppets swearing, killing one another, etc.  A puppet using the F word is a pretty dang funny idea the first few times you hear it, but grows stale very fast, like back in school when you'd ask some chick if she wanted to join the Pen15 club.  It's got it's share of clever sequences like the Montage spoof.  The Team America theme song is  a funny spoof of the kinds of theme songs you'd hear in 80s cartoons like GI Joe.  All in all Team America may try too hard, but you do have to admire the against-the-grain approach.  Plus you have to give it credit for not being a remake of anything.  Buy it along with The Incredibles for a family movie night!</p></body></html>

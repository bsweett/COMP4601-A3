<meta name="summary" content="Pheonix and Witherspoon CAN SING!"></head><body><p>The lead actors sing with their own voices in a very convincing fashion. Reese Witherspoon brings June Carter to the silver screen opposite Pheonix's Johnny Cash. In a true story of a love that begins as a childhood crush (little Johnny listens to June on the radio before meeting her years later as an adult) and later a pining that last several years, June and Johnny take may roads before finding their way back to one another. It's a relationship fraught with Cash's addictions, marriage, inner demons, family fueding and Carter's own turmoil, career highs and lows, and years of refusing to acknowledge her own feelings for Cash.<br /><br />The most telling scene is their duet on The Johnny Cash show that reflects Cash's despondency that Carter will never be his:<br /><br />It Ain't Me, Babe Lyrics<br /><br />Go away from my window,<br /><br />Leave at your own chosen speed.<br /><br />I'm not the one you want, babe,<br /><br />I'm not the one you need.<br /><br />You say you're lookin' for someone<br /><br />Who's never weak but always strong,<br /><br />To protect you an' defend you<br /><br />Whether you are right or wrong,<br /><br />Someone to open each and every door,<br /><br />But it ain't me, babe,<br /><br />No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,<br /><br />It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.<br /><br />Go lightly from the ledge, babe,<br /><br />Go lightly on the ground.<br /><br />I'm not the one you want, babe,<br /><br />I'll only let you down.<br /><br />You say you're lookin' for someone<br /><br />Who will promise never to part,<br /><br />Someone to close his eyes for you,<br /><br />Someone to close his heart,<br /><br />Someone to die for you an' more,<br /><br />But it ain't me, babe,<br /><br />No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,<br /><br />It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.<br /><br />You say you're looking for someone<br /><br />Who'll pick you up each time you fall,<br /><br />To gather flowers constantly<br /><br />An' to come each time you call,<br /><br />A love you for your life an' nothing more,<br /><br />But it ain't me, babe,<br /><br />No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,<br /><br />It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.</p></body></html>

I stayed away. In the meantime, I began to read articles on how people seeing the movie were becoming possessed themselves, by upset stomachs, fainting, and leaving.<br />When it came time for me to see the movie on the big screen, I was holding on to my seat with remorseful anticipation during the blank screen pre-movie showing, back in the day when in between movies was not bombarded by ads. I was wrong, and even surprised. As often as this movie has been punned by flicks like Repossessed, and horribly redone by movies like Beyond The Door, this movie almost needed no unduly jabs. You either found it repulsive, scary, or just plain funny. I felt the latter.<br />Unfortunitely, I was a Monster magazine devout reader, and they pretty much went into many articles concerning how scary movies are made. When I watched this movie, I kept analyzing how it was done, so much so, I forgot the terror I was supposed to feel. I enjoyed it, but its Ellen Burstyn, as the traumatized mother, that makes this movie really click.<br />She is the springboard for major concern, while the other actors play off of her situation. This movie didn't scare me, but it was well made and I like the original version best. Too much subliminal messages are incorporated in the additional scene footages, and they distract.<br />Tubular Bells score is simply awesome, even now!</p></body></html>

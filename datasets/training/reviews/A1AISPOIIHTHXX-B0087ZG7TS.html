It's not that I'm against films geared more towards the better half but I usually find those films unbelievably melodramatic and even at times manipulative that it's as if the film wants to do anything it can to make you walk out in tears, saying how amazing the film was. Director Joe Wright's last film, Pride and Prejudice, is similar but here it's better handled but it's still not as great as it was made to be.<br /><br />It's 1935 and Cecilia is living in the beautiful countryside with her family during summer vacation awaiting the arrival of her brother. Sister Briony is a precocious and aspiring writer who's just finished her latest play she wants to put on for the arrival. But witnessing Cecilia and love Robbie as well as reading a letter, Briony feels dejected since she too feels something for Robbie so when she finds a terrible event happening at night, she blames Robbie. 5 years later and choosing World War II rather than prison, Briony tries to make amends and bring together the 2 she helped separate.<br /><br />Every Oscars there's usually that one film that was well-received by critics and ends up being nominated for Best Picture even though there's probably no chance that it'll win the top prize. Atonement is to me the same type of film since others released last year were better but getting a nod meant lots of attention would be paid towards it. While it is well directed and written, there's nothing really about it that makes it better than any film released last year so it brings unfair judgments. The first half is flawless in its pace and story but then the war stuff comes, we get a time jump and it's either too sluggish or it's too surface-level and not enough depth.<br /><br />What most people remember about the film is a huge tracking shot halfway in that shows thousands of extras, a huge set complete with a choir, ferris wheel and the like. While it's certainly a long, complicated and impressive shot, there's something too "look what we can do" about it that makes it more showing off rather than Children of Men which used it to actually tell the story at the same time. But the film, with its gorgeous cinematography and unique Academy award winning score (which I felt was given mainly for its inventive use of a typewriter clacking than it being the best score) doesn't really excel at doing romance perfectly.<br /><br />Acting-wise everyone is solid with Keira Knightley still taking on projects to prove she can act, James Mcavoy showing he can have a bright future but the standout is Saoirse Ronan playing young Briony showing a naivety-yet-intelligence without being one of those know-it-all brats you wish someone would slap. My one knock with the Briony character is that with her 2 elder counterparts, played by Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave, they give her the same haircut and it feels like they didn't trust the actresses enough to do the different parts so they just made them have the same hair as if haircuts and old age ended up giving the same results anyway. Small complaint but still.<br /><br />I would recommend the film to women definately while for the guys I would for those who don't mind the melodramaticness of the story. While I consider Diving Bell and the Butterfly better than this, it was at least a solid film anyway, just not exceptional.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Top notch transfer for "Green Mile" and extras make this worth the double dip"></head><body><p>The most important question is simple and straight forward; is this two disc edition of "The Green Mile" worth the upgrade? Yes. The three hour film is now spread over two dual layered discs allowing breathing room for the sound and images along with the inclusion of a commentary track from the director. While the previous edition released in 1999 looked extremely nice this edition has sharper images and better definition. I suspect the same transfer was probably used and just that the increased space to spread the film over two discs probably helped improve (along with improvements in digital technology)the look of the film.<br /><br /> We get a terrific and informative Commentary by writer/director Frank Darabont. Unfortuantely only two deleted scenes have survived as Darabont points out in the commentary in discussion about a scene (and the possibility of creating a "Director's Cut")most films have their dalies transferred to hard drive for assemlbing a rough cut and many of the deleted scenes were erased. The two deleted scenes included are interesting but only hint at other scenes lost during the editing process. It used to be that deleted scenes would be tossed into a bin with trims for possible later use not the digital age has made that impossible unless the director saves ALL the trims.<br /><br />We also get a great 90 minute documentary on the challenges (and fears)that Darabont faced in making another Stephen King project. He was afraid that he would be seen only as a Stephen King director (or a director of prison dramas which are hardly in vogue right now)which might limit his options as a director later in his career but he realized that the material was so powerful in human drama that it was worth the risk.<br /><br />We also get Tom Hanks make up tests, Michael Duncan Clark's screen tests, the teaser trailer (along with a look at what constitutes a great teaser), original theatrical trailer. We also get the original vintage featurette on the production of the film. I would have liked a commentary from Hanks and the other actors but with so much time having passed and the actors busy schedules it would have been difficult to assemble them for a sit down commentary track (although they could have cobbled together a second audio track with actors interviews discussing the film although I doubt it would as valuable).<br /><br />Nevertheless having compared my previous edition to this for the $6 extra dollars this is the edition to get. I should point out that many retailers (Costco among them) have this available for $9.00 the same price as the original version is currently selling for making this a terrific bargain.<br /><br />REVIW OF THE FILM BELOW:<br />"The Green Mile" the third film made by Frank Darabont from Stephen King's work is surprisingly strong and an outstanding follow up to Darabont's version of "Shawkshank". Based on the five short serial novels (now available as a single novel) published back in 1997. This marvelous follow up film is a terrific but flawed film that sags a bit at the beginning but manages to quickly pick up us its pace. It's not that it isn't involving it is but the third act of the fil is where the film picks up its momentum.<br /><br />Nominated for four Academy Awards (including Best Picture)this is a rich drama with strong performances all around including a terrific and moving performance from Tom Hanks in the lead. Well worth picking up for fans of King's work but, more importantly, for fans of moving dramas/fantasy films with more than touch of reality.</p></body></html>

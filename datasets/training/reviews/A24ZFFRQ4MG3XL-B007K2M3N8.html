Kevin doesn't just act in this - it's almost like he really IS Darin.  His Bobby Darin look alike performance in Beyond The Sea was truly brilliant and his vocals and dancing were outstanding too.  This movie really details Bobby's life and his love affair with Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth) fairly accurately.  Kevin is a good actor whether he's playing a gangster, criminal or a real-life entertainer - the King of Hollywood.<br />This movie is good for everyone to see, whether or not you were a Bobby Darin fan or not.  It follows the rise of Darin from 'nothing' to the legend he eventually became.  The music is great (especially Mack The Knife and the title song Beyond The Sea).  If you want a movie with drama, romance and fantastic music, this is a must.  I bought this dvd a year ago, and still play it often.  It's great and I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

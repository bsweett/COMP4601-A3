I have never seen any film that so many want to be rid of at one time.  Alright, the main problem, and this carries on throughout the story, is that I expected Morpheus and Neo and Trinity from "The Matrix" to show up at any moment.  Or, at least, to see Batman go flying by overhead and pausing ever so slightly to cover the Moon.  Where o' where did Daredevil's super-abilities come from?  Okay, for the sake of comic book fantasy I can buy into a blind superhero with the ability of echo-location.  It makes for some interesting and often cool special effects shots mixing sound and visual action.  But at no point does it make clear why he can suddenly jump off a building, fall for ten stories, then bounce athletically from scaffolding to scaffolding until he lands without a scratch.  By the end of the film Daredevil is jumping from rooftop to rooftop, across four-lane streets!  Also, there are so many moments that rip off "Batman" and "Batman Returns" that this film is really nothing more than another contrived superhero flick.  Also, contrary to my earlier statement which involved specific special effects, most of the other effects are horrible, looking more like computer game characters battling one another, then editing in close-ups of the character's faces.  It all makes for some surreal continuity and requires a serious suspension of disbelief.  Overall, this is a lame superhero movie with a flat script, bland performances, and ideas stolen from previous blockbusters in the feeble hope at repeat success.  Don't help out the studios who insist on making the same kinds of films again and again.  Do not buy this movie.</p></body></html>

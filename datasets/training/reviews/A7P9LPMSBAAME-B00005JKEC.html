<meta name="summary" content="A TOUR DE FORCE OF ACTING"></head><body><p>The movie is mediocre. A cop movie that is brutal and definitely action packed. BUT, both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawk brought their A game for this film. Washington is Stellar in every movie he does, but he plays the monster in this one to the hilt. He is the movie. Despite the materials mediocrity, I can rewatch this one and always be taken in by Mr. Washington's powerful performance. He's the MAN.<br />I met with a friend of mine today to loan her some movies (I like to share) and I mentioned Denzel Washington.<br />She agreed That he is one of our best contemporary actors. She then said she doesn't like really violent movies, but was conflicted about the movie TRAINING DAY because both DENZEL WASHINGTON and ETHAN HAWKE were so magnificent in this movie, she liked to watch it anyway. (By the way, she agreed the movie was mediocre) It's all about the acting in this one. These two guys are the very best in this film!!!!</p></body></html>

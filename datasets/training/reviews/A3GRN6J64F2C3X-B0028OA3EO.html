<meta name="summary" content="Maybe not a superlative "Superman" but definitely a worthy effort"></head><body><p>Like 1978's "Superman", 2006's "Superman Returns" is more stately, grand, and admirable than truly exciting and fun. But, like the earlier film, those traits are more than enough to recommend it. In many ways, in fact, this film feels more like a remake of that first Christopher Reeve film than a quasi-continuation of the Reeve series.<br /><br />For example, "Superman" featured a plot centering around Lex Luthor's scheme to create a new West Coast of the United States. "Superman Returns" features a plot centering around Lex Luthor's scheme to create a new continent. "Superman" featured a sequence showing Superman being dumped into a swimming pool with a hunk of kryptonite chained around his neck, with him luckily being rescued by a woman who jumps into the water and removes the kryptonite from his person. "Superman Returns" features a sequence showing Superman being dumped into the ocean with a hunk of kryptonite jammed into his side, with him luckily being rescued by a woman who jumps into the water and removes the kryptonite from his person. The former film shows Supes rescuing Lois from a helicopter mishap. The new film shows Supes rescuing Lois from a jetliner mishap. In other words, in classic remake fashion, the new film just upped the ante and created fancier versions of those earlier scenes. So, if you don't mind that approach (and especially if you liked the earlier film), you shouldn't have much of a problem here.<br /><br />Of course, "Superman Returns" doesn't completely take the remake approach. It also functions as sort of quasi-sequel, making it clear that to some extent the events of the earlier films happened to this new Superman we're seeing. I say "quasi-sequel" because director Brian Singer seems to pick and choose among the details of the earlier mythology, keeping some and discarding others. For example, it's acknowledged in the new film that Superman and Lois did indeed have a previous relationship, but it's pretty clear that it likely didn't happen exactly as depicted in the Donner/Lester films. If it DID happen pretty much the way we remember way back when (especially in "Superman II"), the NEXT Singer/Routh film will need a scene like this to smooth over all the plot contortions:<br /><br />Supes: I'm sorry for everything. You must have been pretty confused when you found yourself... expecting. I, uh, made you sort of forget that we ever... became close.<br /><br />Lois: Yes... I remembered the feelings, the emotions, the fact that we had a connection... but, yeah... I didn't remember that we, uh... you know.<br /><br />Supes: So, what did you think when...?<br /><br />Lois: Actually, I guess I have you to thank for me not going crazy wondering what happened to me. Now that I know the truth about Jason, as far as I can guess... your, uh, alien DNA or whatever- mixing with my human DNA- resulted in a pregnancy that took well over a year to come to term. And I didn't show for the longest time. Another side effect of our... "hybrid union", I guess. So, by the time it WAS clear I was pregnant, I had long since been dating Richard and just thought the baby was his. Honestly, I wasn't trying to hide anything from you.<br /><br />Supes: I know. But what do we do now?<br /><br />But we'll let the film writers finish up the above scenario if they choose to do so in the next "Superman" installment... "Superman Returns Again", perhaps? My point is, even though I hope the next chapter is more of a fun roller coaster ride where Superman really lets loose, the quirky remake/sequel nature- and ultimately "tribute" nature- of "Superman Returns" does result in a movie that is never less than interesting. And, yes, the movie does have its exciting sequences, too, even if some of those sequences are laced with those same pesky illogical quirks that plagued the exciting moments from the first film. But those are a whole other set of quibbles.<br /><br />So, just get the DVD (the two-disc version with all the extra features is quite well done) and sit back and enjoy the movie. Just do yourself a favor and leave your keen sense of scrutiny off to the side for later, like for when you're doing your tax returns or editing your Master's Thesis. Because, if you just try to relax and have fun with "Superman Returns", chances are you'll do just that.</p></body></html>

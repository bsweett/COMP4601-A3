Director Stephen Sommers takes the stuff of our favorite fictional monsters and blends them together to create a highly imaginative reconstruction of the story of Dracula.  Resemblances to Bram Stoker's original tale are entirely accidental.  Instead we find Dracula  (Richard Roxburgh) using with Dr. Frankenstein (Samuel West) to serve some dark and nefarious purpose.  Not very far in the background is a werewolf (Will Kemp) who carries part of the answer to the puzzle - when he isn't trying to chew a hole in Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman).<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale plays Anna Valerious, the last living member of her family, who have been dedicated to exterminating Dracula for some 400 years.  Thanks to an oath of her forefathers, the Valerious line is condemned to purgatory as long as Dracula wanders the night.  Concerned that this curse is about to become permanent, a secret order of the Catholic Church sends in their best occult assassin - Van Helsing - aided reluctantly by Friar Carl (David Wenham), who plays the mad inventor to Van Helsing's athletic efforts.  Gabriel shows up to help Anna, is promptly rebuffed by the woman, whose mind is definitely her own.  But the action goes ballistic, and no one gets time to be banished or stomp off.<br /><br />And of action, special effects, stunts. and computer graphics there is a great muchness.  Most of which looks just believable enough to keep the audience staring open mouthed at the screen.  An outstanding job is done with Dracula's wives (Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca, and Josie Maran) and the Frankenstein monster (Shuler Hensley).  So good that these characters very nearly steal the entire show.  Sets are equally carefully crafted, with a marvelous medieval town and two whole gothic castles.  The visual impression of the film often completely overwhelms the story.<br /><br />The acting is bright, with a slightly crude, sarcastic style of interplay between the characters. The overall touch is comedic, despite the inevitable sour grapes of the ending.  Don't look for greatness here.  The point is to create an exciting, fun experience, not to recreate the dark and brooding spirit behind the originals.  Sommers does well with this tongue-in-cheek, cut-and-run style and Van Helsing proves this once again</p></body></html>

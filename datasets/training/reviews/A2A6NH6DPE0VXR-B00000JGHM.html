Well they were in Godfatheer 2 together but shared no scenes together anyway. They chose the right movie to star in together with Heat that's for sure. They both are equelly good here. Pacino plays a cop on the trail of criminals who are great at what they do. Deniro plays the leader of the robbers.  Him and his team do a job that was just supposed to  be steal the money from a armered truck and leave. Deniro's character believes in killing only when you have to. Things go bad though when a new member of his team turns out to be nuts and kills the guards out of cold blood.<br /><br />  This movie has a great script and great director that both give Pacino and Deniro a chance to do some of their best work. It's original and smart. Is one scene where Pacino pulls over Deniro and instead of arresting him. They go get a cup coffee and get to know each other as people. You don't get that much in movies at all. What shortly follows that scene is an awesome robbery scene that's one of the best ever filmed. This film just has it all. Realistic human emotion, a great cast and one of the best endings to a movie I've ever scene. Elliot Goldenthal's great musical score makes the ending even more powerful and beautiful . Why this wasn't nominated for best picture is beyond me.</p></body></html>

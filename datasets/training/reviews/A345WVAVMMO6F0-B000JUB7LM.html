<meta name="summary" content="allow the great acting to kayo the ridiculous writing"></head><body><p>if you overlook the plethora of absurd plot holes (excuse me, but no cops are seeking clint eastwoods character for murder???) and concentrate on the strong performances, this is a good movie. hilary swank as the injured boxer and morgan freeman as the best friend both merited their oscars. but i cant rate this as a first-rate tear jerker because of the ridiculous screenplay by glorified tv hack paul haggis, who went on to perpetrate the even stupider screenplay for "crash".</p></body></html>

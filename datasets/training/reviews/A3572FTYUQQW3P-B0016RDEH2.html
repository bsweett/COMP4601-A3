<meta name="summary" content="Pride Goeth Before The Fall"></head><body><p>This is a beautifully photographed film with outstanding technical support, but this is not a film for the young or sensitive adults for that matter.  There are other films that are more violent than this one but the violence here stands out, because like the film Psycho, the violence is extreme and unexpected, which lends major shock value to it. I cannot emphasize this enough, because the violence is both shocking and difficult to watch.<br /><br />The film is two parallel story lines that intersect only at the end of the film. Captain Vidal reflects the legendary pride of the upper class Spaniard.  He views all others as essentially inhuman and acts accordingly.  Even he acknowledges his weakness is pride but that pride has poisoned him leaving him devoid of humanity.  Ofelia (a good symbolic name), the young girl is offered as a counterpoint to the Captain.  While the Captain lives in a brutal world of reality Ofelia lives in a world of escapism.  However, her fantasy world is not a pleasant place but is more like the original Grimm Fairy Tales, filled with violence and threatening characters.  The faun (Pan) she encounters in the labyrinth (of her mind) is very complex and whose motives are never overly clear.  Ofelia doesn't like the Captain and fears him but she doesn't trust the Faun and is uncertain if he is acting in her best interest or not.  She disobeys her mother and the Captain, just as she disobeys the Faun, which illustrates the parallelism.  Ultimately she defies the Captain and the Faun, which leads to the ultimate destruction of them all.  But the actual instrument of that destruction is the Captains pride.  He neglects his duty through his drive for a son, he destroys his wife through his pride, he destroys everything through his pride.  The Gods raise up those whom they wish to destroy.<br /><br />Did I enjoy this film?  I'm not sure. It is a riveting film and compels your interest even at it's most violent.  It certainly is a film that requires some thought once you have seen it.  It is beautifully photographed with an excellent albeit somewhat flawed screen play. It is filled with symbolisms and we know almost from the outset (the Captains watch) that time is running out for the Captain.  The acting is superb, but did I enjoy it?  I really don't know - - yet.  I do know that I only saw Psycho once and never saw it again -- even though it was an excellent movie.  I suspect this film will be like that as well.  If you like films and see them as an art form, this is one to see, if you think of films simply as entertainment, you may want to skip this one because it requires thought and reflection to fully understand.</p></body></html>

The truth of the matter is, as moviegoers realize and even Sylvester Stallone himself freely acknowledges, that it was over four films ago.  Why is it, then, that ROCKY BALBOA packs the most fierce and delightful punch since the original masterpiece?  Why is it that thirty years and five sequels later, we still leap up in our seats, toss our popcorn aside, and cheer for Rocky Balboa?  The answer is one word: heart.  The film has heart, and it has it because ROCKY BALBOA stays true to the heart of the original film, long before the increasingly silly sequels began flying like Balboa's much-acclaimed punches.<br /><br />In ROCKY BALBOA, the titular hero has given up his boxing career (which he actually did at the start of ROCKY V - remember ROCKY V?) and now runs a successful restaurant in the slums of Philadelphia.  His beloved wife Adrian has passed on, and his son has grown up to be an office worker haunted by his father's huge shadow.  His best friend Paulie (the wonderful Burt Young) continues to work in the meat shop.  Meanwhile, back in the ring, ferocious young fighter Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) has taken over as the Heavyweight Champion of the World, and has absolutely no competition, having never been defeated in his career.  When a controversial "fight simulation" between Dixon and Rocky Balboa airs on ESPN, Dixon's publicity-starved managers attempt to set up an exhibition between the current and former Heavyweight Champions of the World.  To the dismay of most of Rocky's friends, he decides to fight Dixon, realizing that it may be the ultimate way to finally accept Adrian's passing.<br /><br />Although this film began building up immense hype immediately after it became known that it was being made, I was positive it would be the weakest of the series after viewing its outrageous trailer.  I don't think I was alone in that prediction, and I'm sure that there are still many people who avoided seeing this film because, well, five ROCKYs was enough.  However, I found that ROCKY BALBOA was my second cinematic surprise in a row (the first being CASINO ROYALE).  The surprise: ROCKY BALBOA is not the simply best ROCKY sequel - it's an excellent film as well.<br /><br />There's a number of reasons for that.  The biggest, as I said before, is heart.  The film's got heart, and the man responsible for it all is Sylvester Stallone.  Stallone is truly a wonder.  At sixty years old, he's in the best shape of his life (the guy is huge), he just cranked out an excellent ROCKY sequel (THE excellent ROCKY sequel), and he's about ready to begin production on the fourth RAMBO movie (a movie I'm highly anticipating).  Stallone's script for the movie is heartfelt and true to the spirit of the original film, and at times it's even quite clever; the ending is beautiful.  Stallone's directing is surprisingly classy, as is the gritty photography.  Longtime ROCKY fans may be pleased to learn that composer Bill Conti returns to the series for the first time since ROCKY III, and though most of the music is reused music from the original film, that's really all this movie needs.  One song in particular stands out.<br /><br />That song is, of course, "Gonna Fly Now", the soaring anthem that has been the ultimate workout tune for thirty years.  It's used in the inevitable "training montage", a sequence that the series has never had a problem with making interesting and enjoyable.  This montage is especially inspirational: we haven't seen one of cinema's most beloved heroes in sixteen years, and suddenly he bursts on to the scene and benches about three-hundred pounds more than I'll ever be able to.  I really felt like I was gonna fly now during that scene, and I know I'm not alone.<br /><br />Does ROCKY BALBOA have its flaws?  Sure.  It has the occasional laughable moment (particularly when Stallone mumbles something about dancing with bears), but for the most part Stallone knows when the film could wind up being hokey or silly or cliched and he avoids that.  The film is actually very funny intentionally, be it from Rocky's constant greeting of "Yo, how you doin'?" or a well-timed parody of the series' earlier entries.<br /><br />In the final round, and this is undoubtedly the final round, ROCKY BALBOA is the sweetest kind of surprise.  It's like seeing an old friend for the first time in years and seeing that he not only is still alive and kicking - or, in this case, punching - but also that he's doing better than ever.  The directing, the acting, the screenwriting, it's all top-notch, and that's all because of heart.  Heart goes a long way, and thanks to the heart of Sylvester Stallone, as well as his woefully-neglected mind, ROCKY BALBOA is a knockout.</p></body></html>

All of the religious issues aside (I'm Catholic and not convinced by this work of FICTION!), "Code" read like a big action/mystery yarn with a non-stop chase sequence.  Unfortunately, Ron Howard's handling of the book on the big screen isn't what I'd hoped for.  The story seems to get lost in the "whodunit?" aspect and leaves most viewers (like my wife) completely lost until the end of the film.  Also, the characters aren't developed well enough to have any attachment to them.  In the book, Silas comes across as one of the most pitiful creatures on the planet.  Manipulated by those who use his convictions against him, Silas is one of the most saddening characters I've ever run into.  On the big screen, he's portrayed as nothing but a religious zealot until the bloody end.  Tom Hanks, Jean Reno, and Alfred Molina all play their respective characters well, but I can find no attachment to them.  Audrey Tautou is, in my opinion, very unlikeable as Sophie.  The biggest shocker to me was Ian McKellen's total misplay of Teabing.  In the book, Teabing was drawn out as the jolly scoundrel who got away with any and everything because he's British.  In this movie, McKellen plays down the character and even though he still has that British charm about him, he's not as interesting as I'd hoped he be.<br /><br />In short, read the book, kiddoes.  It's much better than this film.  As far as the DVD goes, it's packed with the typical "pat on the back" documenaries.  The digital transfer is nice, and I have no complaints about the audio.  I just feel that the film is nowhere near as good as it could have been.<br /><br />Don't let the religious twists and historical inaccuracies discourage you, this is a very good story, but it's so much better on the page than it is on the screen.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Michael Pena, Superstar"></head><body><p>This one won't take long to go to DVD, but it's a muscular, enjoyabvle vehicle for up and coming star Michael Pena, with a strong supporting part from Mark Wahlberg.  Wonder why they put Wahlberg's name so big above the title, and his photo goes on the poster, when director Antoine Fuqua systematically throws the whole movie to Michael Pena, who plays a rookie FBI agent, Nick Memphis, who cracks the whole case open and gets to be responsible for clearing Wahlberg's name.<br /><br />Maybe Wahlberg was busyt making another movie so his screen time wss limited for this one?  But every time you think, OK, now Bobby Lee is really in trouble, wonder how he's going to get out of this one, Fuqua switches the action to miles away, to wherever Nick Memphis just happens to be.  If I didn't know better I'd think that the movie was planned to be just the first in a whole line of "Nick Memphis" action thrillers, in which Michael Pena would become a superstar on the line of Arnold Schwarzenegger, but Hispanic.  The script had a lot of implausibilities, but surely the name "Nick Memphis" itself is the worst offender?  OK, maybe he was from Memphis, but that's like me calling myself Kevin San Francisco.  It just doesn't fly as a legal name, especially for a straightedge FBI guy.<br /><br />Saw this one on a plane and twenty minutes into I remembered I had read the book this was based on, Stephen Hunter's "Point of Impact."  That book was pretty good.  Here I kept thinking, if I was Marky Mark, there was no way I would have fallen for Isaac Johnson's line of malarkey about, we want you to think of a good way to assassinate the US president, come on, anybody would have said, Hell no.  Yet in the book you believed it.</p></body></html>

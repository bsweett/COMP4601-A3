<meta name="summary" content="Unrealistic"></head><body><p>Hostel is a watchable film about two American backpackers who head to a hostel in a European country where they have been promised lots of sex and drugs. It is a setup and they inevitably end up in a torture chamber.  This is where the film includes very intense images and is not for the faint hearted.  However, Hostel is quite unrealistic whereas a film like "Wolf Creek" is actually based on true events of missing backpackers, so the scenes of torture are incredibly disturbing and much more believable than those depicted in Hostel.<br /><br />One reviewer on another site said that the good thing about the film is seeing Americans get what they deserve for their over-confidence and the way they think they are so much better than any other nation.  Well, that is one persons' opinion ... but it was kind of fun to see some American teenagers getting their just desserts after all those ridiculous teenage road movies which are nothing but degradation of women.<br /><br />Hostel is worth a rent, but not sure if it is worth owning on DVD.  Overall, I recommend people watching Wolf Creek over this teenage romp.</p></body></html>

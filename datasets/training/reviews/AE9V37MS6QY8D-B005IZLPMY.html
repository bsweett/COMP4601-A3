I'm not a big Marvel fan ... or Captain America fan, for that matter. I consider him to be just a big propaganda creation for the U.S. military. And while he is just that, this was still a really well-done film. It was not as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LWZW42">X-Men: First Class</a> but it is right up there with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C08RHA">Iron Man (Single-Disc Edition)</a>.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Re-hash of Similar Plot Simply Doesn't Fly"></head><body><p>There is a reason that the 1978 version of Superman is a classic.  It stands against the test of time.  Christopher Reeve definitely made you think that he could fly.  Subtle body movements were more than enough to make you feel Superman in flight.  He also captured both Clark Kent and Superman, giving each of them defining characteristics that made you like and care about them, even though they were, technically, the same person.  Back in 1983, they tried to re-make Casablanca.  It isn't hard to understand why it failed.  When a movie is deemed a classic, it's virtually impossible to make it again.  Like a work of art, it can't be duplicated.<br /><br />And that was the first and biggest mistake of the writers and filmmakers on Superman Returns.  They simply should have made a Superman of their own rather than try to copy and extend the storyline from the original films made over 20 years ago.  Christopher Nolan understood this when he decided to finally make a good Batman film (Batman Begins).<br /><br />The writers probably thought they were paying tribute to the 1978 classic when they borrowed similar plot lines and even used the same dialogue in several places in this film.  You'll recognize many lines and parallel plots to easily make the connections between the '78 version and this film.<br /><br />In the 1978 version, Lex tries to sink part of California to increase the value of the desert land he bought.  In this version, he attempts to create his own land, using stolen Kryptonite technology and wiping out the eastern half of the United States.  You can't help but say, "haven't we already seen something like this before?"<br /><br />To be fair to Brandon Routh, you simply can't fill the shoes of Christopher Reeve.  However, Routh makes Superman much too wooden.  He doesn't give much indication of anything.  He lacks the charisma that's needed to play both Superman and Clark Kent.  His facial expressions are nearly void of emotion or feeling.  Christopher Reeve was a Juliard trained actor.  He literally immersed himself in his roles, including Superman.  Routh also doesn't disguise his voice as Clark Kent.  And no one can make the connection?!?  Reeve gave Kent the charm of a bumbling Cary Grant reminicent of the Grant's film "Bringing Up Baby."  Supposedly, Superman Returns is a continuation from the original Superman films.  If so, why does Clark Kent no longer disguise his voice?  Also, you just don't get the sensation that he's flying.  Part of the problem with this is that there aren't enough close-up scenes of him when he's flying.  The writers and director also never devoted enough time to the characters of Clark and Superman to where we feel a connection with them.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is simply awful as Lois Lane.  In fact, I don't think anyone has portrayed her worse.  Bosworth seems almost lost in how to portray the "tough" reporter of Lois Lane.  Even Margot Kidder furnished Lois with a "go get'em" attitude.  Bosworth plays Lois like a wallflower.  Plus, there is no chemistry between Routh and Bosworth which is the pinnacle of this story!  The love connection has always been about Superman and Lois Lane.  Again, they attempted to copy the romantic Superman/Lois flight as Superman takes Lois for quick ride into the night.  It doesn't work.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey has his moments as Lex Luthor when he's almost good as Lex Luthor.  He attempted to stick with Gene Hackman's performance.  The scene with him beating on Superman when he's being affected by kryptonite is good.  Lex is supposed to have a savage side to him.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT BELOW!<br /><br />The back story is also not convincing enough.  Superman travels back to Krypton to find out if it is, in fact, destroyed?!?  After Jor-el tells him during his training that Krypton is gone, it's hard to believe that he would need confirmation, even if astronomers claimed to have seen it.  If Superman remembered Einstein, as Jor-el taught him about Einstein's theories of relativity in the '78 version, Superman would have realized that light from "Krypton" would only now be seen from Earth, and therefore, Krypton is not really there anymore.<br /><br />Also, the part with Superman having a son just doesn't fit at all.  When and where was this to have supposedly happen?  Again, if this is supposed to be a continuation of the original Superman films, the only time "Superman" slept with Lois Lane was in Superman II, and even then he was mortal.  Plus, the timing doesn't figure into it.  The writers tried to sell this "bit" but instead of trying to make it somewhat credible, it ends up being ludicrous.<br /><br />The kryptonite is also handled poorly.  Superman's powers are literally drained from him, making him even weaker than a normal person.  If you recall in the 1978 version, he couldn't even take the chain off from around his neck when Lex put the kryptonite on him.  And suddenly, in this film, with a fragment of kryptonite stuck in him, he's able to lift a land mass the size of a small country out of the ocean and into space?!?  It isn't likely or believeable, nor are we given a plausible explanation about how he could do this. Even in "Smallville" when Clark is exposed to kryptonite, he can barely move.<br /><br />Many of these problems could have been fixed simply by making a new and different Superman, rather than continuing where the previous films left off.  It would have been that simple.  I mean, they did manage to give Superman a totally different costume (the worst Superman costume ever designed).<br /><br />The special effects were first-rate, but this day and age, special effects aren't enough anymore.  We want a good story with good, believeable characters, and this film simply doesn't have either one.</p></body></html>

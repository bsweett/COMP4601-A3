<meta name="summary" content="Bravo to 13 Going on 30 Excellent."></head><body><p>In an age where girls are being bombarded by the culture we live in, that deems a girls worth solely on her looks. This film goes beyond that and is a positive message for girls to be who they are, not what the world wants them to be . but shows that being nice and respecting yourself , family and others is the  right place to be. that's what i got from it anyway. Great film, But i think the artwork for 13 going on30 is fun but lacking i prefer the special edition artwork better.  Jennifer Garner is just wonderful in the role of Jenna Rink and Mark Ruffalo does a good job as Matt. If you like this film you ought  to check out.( Just Like Heaven) it is also Excellent.  This Film is PG-13 For some profanity,  some sexual content. This film is not for young children as the case implies , but you can choose for yourself, that's a parent's job.  Oh this film is in HD so the colors just pop out at you it's great. it works on regular tv but in HD it comes alive.<br /><br />Highly Recommended Film.<br /><br />P.S. What's funny about the clothes in this film are that Kids of the 80's like myself included wore alot of that stuff acid jean, the works, my sister had those belts it makes me laugh. Micheal Jackson was a big thing so was Madonna and Prince, Journey , The Cars, OMD, Depeche Mode, Human League , Huey Lewis And the News, Midnight Oil and The list goes on.</p></body></html>

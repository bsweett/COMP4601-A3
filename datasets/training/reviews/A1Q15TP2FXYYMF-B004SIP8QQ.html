For starters, the storyline is more convincing, detailed and interesting. The Bride (Uma Thurman) has more to do than just kill lots and lots of people.<br /><br />And because of that, there is also more, and better, character development. The characters were one of the better elements of part 1, and of course, all the survivors are back for this volume, but with more depth.<br /><br />Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah and Uma are all fantastic as their respective characters, truly making you believe in their twisted, violent world.<br /><br />David Carridine is brilliant as the titular Bill. His performance makes you sympathetic to Bill, despite you knowing that he is the baddie, and an exceptionally cruel person. But we still love him! A fantastic character played to perfection.<br /><br />There's also less action than part 1 and all the more better for it. Part 1's overblown, cartoony action is replaced with shorter, but more gritty, realistic and violent set pieces. Check out the trailer fight between Uma nd Darryl Hannah. Superb.<br /><br />A shout should also go out for Robert Rodriguez's music. Allegedly, he composed the film for only $1, and if so, Tarantino certainly got his moneys worth!<br /><br />Tarantino's direction also shines more clearly here, with the scene where The Bride is buried alive particularly springing to mind. Horrifying, chilling, yet stylishly done.<br /><br />In fact, the one thing that really drags this film down a bit is the tutorial scenes with Pei Mei. Slightly dull, a bit too long, it takes you away from the real crux of the story at a crucial point.<br /><br />Nevertheless, a fine film that deserves to be watched, even if you do have to sit through part 1 first. You will be glad you did.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stanley Kubrick Did a Bad, Bad Thing with Eyes Wide Shut"></head><body><p>Stanley Kubrick's last release, &quot;Eye Wide Shut&quot; was a pathetic and misanthropic finish to one of the greatest careers in film making  history.  The only defense I can suggest is that perhaps had Kubrick lived  a bit longer, the film would have been dramatically improved.  Unfortunately, we are only able to judge the finished product that we see  before our very open eyes.  I have an incredible respect and  admiration  for Kubrick's past masterpieces.  &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; for  instance, is perhaps the defining film concerning the Vietnam tragedy.  &quot;Dr. Strangelove,&quot;&quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; and  &quot;The Shining,&quot; will remain among the finest movies of all time.  Every artist, however, has  their inevitable failures, and the giant,  Stanley Kubrick, is no exception.<p>&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is so  incredibly awful that I am convinced only someone as respected as Kubrick  could have gotten it produced.  A  budding screen director would have been  ridiculed.  The banality of the dialogue prompted me to feel sorry for the  actors  who did their best to give the script some credence. Even the  members of the Academy Awards Committee could not find an excuse to  give  the deceased director a prize in even the minor categories.  Publicly the  motion picture industry said all the appropriate things.  The  virtual  silence, however, during the awards ceremony spoke volumes of how they  actually valued &quot;Eyes Wide Shut.&quot; One should also notice  that  the Amazon community reviewers have essentially ignored this movie. Is this  due to a subtle and tacit mindset that believes if you can't  say something  nice, you shouldn't say anything whatsoever?  The only saving grace of this  film is Kubrick's mind boggling ability of  photographing scenes.  My  breath is always taken away when observing the visual beauty of Kubrick's  artistry.  Could any other major  director do it better?  None comes to  mind.  Stanley Kubrick is significantly more skilled than even the talented  Steven Spielberg.  I  suspect that Kubrick was becoming very cynical and  bitter towards the end of his life.  &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; exudes a  misanthropic aura that  made the film difficult to watch.  The highly  publicized nudity was not in the least bit erotic.  The film's pervasive  coldness, subdued anger,  and unjustifiable length gave me the distinct  impression that Kubrick wanted us to suffer through this experience.  I  know little about  Kubrick's final years, but I doubt if he knew much joy  or existential satisfaction.  Chris Isaak's lyrics of &quot;Baby did a bad,  bad  thing&quot; is the signature song of this film.  It behooves me to  paraphrase Isaak and add &quot;Stanley Kubrick did a bad, bad thing.&quot;  Kubrick made  a film best forgotten and beneath his dignity.  Only hard  core Kubrick fans should waste their time.  Furthermore, I am also relieved  that  Amazon.com will allow me future opportunities to evaluate Kubrick's  remaining works.  These caustic remarks will most likely be the  exception.  I must reiterate my praise for all of the other Kubrick films that I was  privileged to see.</p></body></html>

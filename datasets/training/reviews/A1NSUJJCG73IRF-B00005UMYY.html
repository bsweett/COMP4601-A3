<meta name="summary" content="Memento  (2000)"></head><body><p>Director:  Christopher Nolan<br /><br />Cast:  Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, Mark Boone Junior, Russ Fega, Jorja Fox, Stephen Tobolowsky, Harriet Sansom Harris.<br /><br />Running Time:  113 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for violence, language and some drug content.<br /><br />There are a lot of excellent movies whose scripts rewrote the rules of cinematic storytelling (the Oscar-winning "The Usual Suspects" and "Pulp Fiction" are two good examples).  "Memento" deserves a place among those films: it's the most complex, original, innovative, intriguing achievement to hit the big screen in a while.  "Memento" looks like an ordinary film noir, having all the conventional elements (femme fatale, unreliable characters, ambiguous protagonist/narrator, bleak ending), until is fatally strikes you with its originality and audacity, making you unable to stop watching.  Director Christopher Nolan manages to pull off a rare feat in the film business these days by taking the entire industry by storm with his incredible intelligent, disjointed thriller "Memento".  While many films have since tried to imitate its taut script and superb execuation, it remains one fo the most unique and thought-provoking pieces of the past decade.<br /><br />From the beginning you realize you're not watching the usual thriller: the reversed opening sequence is a fascinating narrative choice, and even more fascinating is the director's decision to tell the whole story backwards, with each separate scene ending where the previous one began. Thanks to this trick, the audience is as confused as the movie's main character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a peculiar DIY detective who wants to find the bloke who raped and killed his wife (CSI's Jorja Fox). While attempting to save his wife during the attack, "Lenny" sustained a head injury and has lost his short-term memory, so every new event is gone from his mind after 10 minutes. He has to go on with his life by taking notes, snapping Polaroids and putting tattoos all over his body. He also gets some valuable help from a cop, "Teddy" (Joe Pantoliano), and a barmaid, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss). But should he really trust them, given he can't almost even trust himself due to his neurological condition.  Nolan (who screenwrote the film as well) knows how to build up the tension, as well as add emotion, with the touching parallel story of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), a man with the same disease as Leonard.<br /><br />Both Pearce and Tobolowsky are superb as the two troubled men: the former makes you feel as uneasy as he does almost immediately, and he's got some really ace lines ("How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time?"); the latter, on the other hand, is heartbreaking, his experiences make us wanna cry before the film's over. Pantoliano and Moss are very impressive too, their true intentions remaining unclear until the end.  Nolan beautifully intertwines the present and the past, linking events together like a detective putting all the clues together until the thief is found.  While "Memento" is thoroughly composed with its intertwining plot, the film's great strength can also be considered it potential flaw. The confusion that is inevitable can make it difficult for some to follow, especially for those who are used to a film flowing over them in a passive way. Memento requires you to exercise your brain and even when it is all over certain questions will still remain and further viewing is essential.  Of course, the central paradox of the film should not be forgotten, this is a revenge story but of course the character has now way of remembering the actual crime, his memory is gone and the memory of the act of revenge will also be a fleeting one.  Nolan's story and the ensemble cast's acting are outstanding, but a mention also has to go to the cinematography and soundtrack that both helped greatly to create the oppressive mood that pervaded throughout he film and is essential to generate the sense of fragility that exists in Leonard's connection to the world.  An intelligent, profound, and supreme addition to the genre.  One of the best films of the decade thus far.</p></body></html>

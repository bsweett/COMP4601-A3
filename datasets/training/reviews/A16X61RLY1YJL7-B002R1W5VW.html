<meta name="summary" content="Matchstick Men - A fairly entertaining film!"></head><body><p>I found this movie to be a fairly entertaining one to watch as the plot of the movie is a well thought out one involving a few twists here and there all culminating in the ultimate con that was not predictable at all; my only regret is not having caught this one in the theaters.<p>I've never really been a huge fan of Nicholas Cage but one cannot deny his versatility as an actor as he brings forth his extremely neurotic character in this film.  Performance wise, Nicholas Cage, Sam Rockwell and newcomer Alison Lohman all deserve high praise for their individual and collective efforts in this film.<p>Director Ridley Scott, best known for many great films such as &quot;Alien,&quot; &quot;Gladiator&quot; and a whole horde of other outstanding films steps in to direct this film and once again his talents as a skillful director shine as he takes us through the somewhat convoluted script, never revealing too much until the right time.  He deserves a great amount of credit for the success of this film.<p>The Premise:<p>Roy Waller (Nicholas Cage) is an extremely successful con man who has the home and the money to prove it however, he's also an extremely neurotic individual that had an unsuccessful relationship over fifteen years ago and hasn't attempted one since.  He suddenly finds that he needs to get some new anti depressants but now he has to go to a new doctor to get them and this psychologists actually wants him to talk about his problems which leads to him having a &quot;daughter.&quot;  In comes Angela (Alison Lohman), his &quot;daughter&quot; and now he's a parent.<p>What follows from there is a fairly entertaining film as we're treated to Nicholas Cage at his finest in portraying a lonely, neurotic man who suddenly has a daughter and still has his life as a con man to contend with...<p>I would definitely recommend this film to any and all who enjoy a good con/comedy that will have you guessing the direction of the film all the way to its conclusion.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-Tricks of the Trade:  Making Matchstick Men<br />-Follow the Director through and intimate day-to-day account of the filmmaking process<br />*Part I:  Preproduction<br />*Part II:  Production<br />*Part III:  Postproduction<br />-Commentary by Director/Producer Ridley Scott, Writer Nicholas Griffin and Writer/Producer Ted Griffin<br />-Theatrical Trailer</p></body></html>

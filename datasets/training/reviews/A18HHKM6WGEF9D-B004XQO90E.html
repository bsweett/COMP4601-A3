<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Concept, Strong Performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, But Dragged At Times"></head><body><p>This was an intriguing concept - Jake Gyllenhaal's character appears to be sent back in time - or to a simulated version of it, it isn't apparent at first - over and over to try and determine who planted a bomb on an already exploded train, in order to try and stop a threatened second attack. Each time he learns a little more, but we are not really sure where he is in 'real time' and where it is he is visiting (and I can't reveal too much without spoiling the film.) Jake Gyllenhaal gives a great performance, a fine balance of pathos, anger, fear, and frustration. The supporting cast of Michelle Monaghan (as a woman on the train) and Vera Farmiga (as a military officer involved in the simulation/time travel) are both excellent as well.<br /><br />The action was filmed wonderfully, and the story kept me intrigued. My only complaints, and the reason for the 4-star rating, is that the film dragged at parts, when the Jake G. character returned to the train over and over. It's a difficult scenario to pull off - forcing the viewer to watch the same scene over and over, or at least parts of it - and I felt it did get old. Also, I was still slightly baffled about certain aspects of the plot at the end - as to what the 'source code' exactly was - I felt it needed to be fleshed out a little bit more. But overall, a good film.</p></body></html>

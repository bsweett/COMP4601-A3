The movie is completely unbeliveable and I'm sorry it's also not entertaining in the least. I'm usually a big action movie guy but this one is just a bad bad attempt. This movie didn't make me care anything for the characters nor was I interested in the very loose plot. Thank God it was just a rental and I only wasted ninety nine cents :) Rock On.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A true holiday classic..."></head><body><p>Adapted from humorist Jean Shepherd's hilarious memoir (In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash), A Christmas Story has climbed the ranks of the annual holiday must see films to claim its spot among the hallowed elite. If you've ever tried to lick a frozen telephone pole, or found yourself in a ridiculous outfit on Christmas morning, then A Christmas Story is one comedy that you won't want to miss...<br /><br />The story focuses on one central character - 5th grader Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) and his all-encompassing quest to receive a Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB rifle for Christmas (you could put an eye out with one of those things, you know?) Thwarting Ralphie at every turn are his mother (Melinda Dillon) and father (Darren McGavin) who seem absolutely oblivious to their young child's aims.<br /><br />Unable to come right out and say what he wants, Ralphie drops subtle hints around the house (such as placing clipped-out magazine ads for the gun in his parents' nightstand reading material). When prodded for his true Christmas wish, Ralphie blurts out that he wants a Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB gun, but his mother's only reply is, "You don't want one of those. You'll shoot your eye out!"<br /><br />A Christmas Story is filled with memorable scenes and highlights that have helped built a cult following around the life of a young boy obsessed with Christmas and surrounding by eccentric family members. When Ralphie's father beams with pride at his ability to win a newspaper contest, his proudly displays his prize in the front window of the family home - his prize being a lamp with a woman's long, stocking-covering leg as its own leg to stand on. Embarrassed, Ralphie's mother "accidentally" breaks it, sparking a war of words with her husband. Meanwhile, Ralphie dreams of saving the whole family with his Red-Ryder BB gun, and thus earning their undying gratitude.<br /><br />One of the best sequences in the film involves a family trip to the local department store, where Ralphie and his little brother Randy meet with the store Santa Clause near closing time. Following a long, extended wait to reach the front of the line to see Santa, Ralphie is so brimming with anticipation to tell Santa what he wants that he can't speak. So, Santa convinces Ralphie that he wants a football. But before Santa's helper can push Ralphie down the North Pole slide, Ralphie blurts out his true wish, only to hear Santa's reply, "You'll shoot your eye out with that, kid!"<br /><br />One of the best Christmas comedies ever made (few come close to Christmas Vacation), A Christmas Story is a memorable holiday classic that the whole family can enjoy. In much the same way as It's A Wonderful Life, the film has only grown in popularity in the years since its release. The timeless nature of its subject matter lends itself well to annual holiday viewing, and it remains one of the few "must see" films of the season...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></body></html>

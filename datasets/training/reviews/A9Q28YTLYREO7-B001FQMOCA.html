<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good film"></head><body><p>I truyl enjoyed the acting performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash,though overall he was missing that edge that Reese Witherspoon brought as June Cash.I think Her Performance is what got her awarded the Oscar.the film was well put together.just was missing something which kept it from being very good to great. still the Chemstry between Phoenix&Witherspoon is on point. good to see the film acknowledging many of the Highs&Lows of Johnny Cash's Musica career.</p></body></html>

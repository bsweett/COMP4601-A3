<meta name="summary" content="Burton at His Best"></head><body><p>Starring Ewan McGregor, and Albert Finney in an offbeat story about an estranged son who returns home to visit his dying father, and learns more about him by piecing together the stories he has gathered over the years. In a typical Tim Burton offbeat and colorful way, McGregor (playing his father as a younger man in flashback) helps the son (played by Billy Crudup) by re-creating his father's elusive life in a series of legends and myths inspired by the few facts he knows, the result of which is often funny but also beautifully poignant. Burton's quirky signature is ever prevalent here, in this often lavish and wonderfully ridiculous story which raises a few smiles, and leaves the viewer with a warm (if confused) feeling at times.<br />The main thrust of the script is how the initial "Fish Stories" relayed by the aging man to his son ultimately come to teach him the real truth about the life of the man he has regrettably not known, and the end result is a very entertaining movie for the whole family, or singular audience.</p></body></html>

Personally, Milla is a bit too "stereotype super model" for my taste, but she's made some great movies, few things scare me more than Romero-stlye zombies, and  the Resident Evil games are the shiznight! Especially part 2, with the delectable Claire Redfield! Anywho, Resident Evil (the movie) is a sort of prequel to the video games, so don't worry if you're unfamiliar with them. The plot goes something like this: The Umbrella Corporation is the most powerful commercial entity in the world, producing a variety of cosmetic and other type products, but making their real money off illegal scientific research and development. Their most horrific new discovery is the T-virus, a chemical agent capable of causing monstrous mutations and even bringing the dead back to life! As if that didn't make it a scary enough place to work, their main center of operations is a huge, underground research facility called "The Hive," located deep below the surface of Raccoon City. The only entrance to the facility is through the walls of a huge mansion on the outskirts of the city. The mansion is guarded by two security agents working for the company and under the guise of a newlywed couple. Everything is very well controlled and planned out, until the day the T-Virus is set loose!<br /><br />Alice (Milla Jovovich), one of the security operatives guarding the mansion, wakes up to find herself naked and confused on the shower floor, with no memory of her life or identity. Suddenly, her home is stormed by a special ops team, and she and two mysterious men are taken prisoner. She soon is informed of who she is and who she works for, and that the strange circumstances are due to something gone wrong within the Hive. Using the secret entrance, the group travels via an underground train to the secret research facility, where they discover the worst has occurred. The T-Virus has escaped, the "Red Queen, the computer entity that controls the security of the underground lair, has killed all employees to minimize risk of spreading the contamination, and all those dead employees are slowly waking up....and they are hungry! Suddenly, the race is on to get back to the train and out of the mansion before the secret blast doors close-up and seal their doom! But, before they can save themselves,  they'll have to face the wrath of the Red Queen, the terror of some monstrously mutated dogs, a horrific creature called "The Licker," and an army of the living dead!<br /><br />What makes "Resident Evil" such an excellent film is the style and attention with which it is executed. Even on a tight budget, the filmmakers, most of which were fans of the game themselves, went to great lengths to make this a movie worth watching again and again! The style of the game is ever present, from the extremely authentic scenes, creatures, and characters, to the brilliant sets, lighting, and camera angles. Homage is paid to great scifi/horror films of the past, as well as to "Alice in Wonderland," seemingly a favorite book of filmmakers all over. The cast is excellently chosen for this type of movie, and I'm particularly impressed with their love of the games. Michelle Rodriguez is frightening, even when not a zombie, and Eric Mabius looks computer generated himself! And I don't mind adding that the producer's sister makes quite a lovely Dr./zombie in the film. And speaking of zombies, thanks so much for sticking with the game and not making those new, fast moving style zombies we see so much in current horror. Those are scary, but they're nowhere near as creepy. Conserving their energy for when you're within reach, these zombies are fast when they need to be, their deceptive slowness making them all the more frightening! The new "Deluxe" version of the DVD isn't overwhelmingly loaded with extras, after all, it's still only one disc, but it does include a fun cast and crew commentary that brings to mind a favorite line from Zoolander: "A model, idiot." It also includes theatrical trailers and featurettes, a clip from Resident Evil: Apocalypse, a visual effects commentary, an alternate ending that I'm sooo happy they didn't use (the ending they DID use is awesome), and filmographies. An incredibly cool, must own film for all fans of the video game and zombie genres! And the sequel is even better!</p></body></html>

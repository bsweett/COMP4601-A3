There he runs into old acquaintances and meets an Elemental (Judy Dench).  There is a terrible danger to the planet and they feel Riddick can help.  The danger is a group known as Necromongers.  They basically believer there is an underverse were death is perfect unlike the flawed life of the universe.  Their leader, the Marshal, has actually been to the underverse and returned a changed man.  They travel from planet to planet recruiting new members and killing all who do not join.  Now Riddick is on their next target.<br /><br />Riddick's unique brand of self interest and order drives him through the movie and the conflict with the seemingly unstoppable foe.  We see political intrigue among the upper ranks of the invaders.  We learn more of Riddick's past (no mention of his being a government trained assassin).  We learn how Riddick and the Necromongers crossed paths in the past.  We learn almost nothing of the Elementals.  It all comes together in a somewhat confusing ending that leaves plenty of loose ends and unanswered questions.<br /><br />This is a strange and confusing film.  Much of it seems like there was no real overall plan.  The Necromonger Marshal is one of the anomalies.  The Marshal is replaced every few years yet the current Marshal is practically a god.  Many of the Necromongers seem a little preoccupied by the pleasures of life.  I would like to have known a little more about the Elementals but there is almost nothing about them.  Then there is the ending.  Just what does it bode?  How does it resolve the situation?  What happens next?  We don't really know and it is frustrating.  Plenty of action and plot pieces but it just didn't seem to hold togther they way it should.  But if you like action, you will find plenty of it here.</p></body></html>

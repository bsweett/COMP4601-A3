<meta name="summary" content="The Cleansing"></head><body><p>Those of you that come to "The Motorcycle Diaries" looking for a new Millennium easy living/ heavy drinking cycle road movie will be very disappointed, for "The Motorcycle Diaries" is more "Gulliver's Travels" than "Easy Rider."<br />This film is based on the diaries of Ernesto "Che" Guevara (Gael Garcia Bernal) kept while on a trip through South America accompanied by his friend Alberto Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna). And while we now know Che Guevara as a revolutionary and a comrade of Fidel Castro's, "The Motorcycle Diaries" ends well before this phase of Che's life.<br />As it is, this movie is quite beautiful to behold but unfortunately for those of us who know the whole (or even parts of the) story of Che's move from vagabond, /medical student/Doctor to a Communist revolutionary, responsible for many deaths, can only be taken aback at the portrayal of Che as a sort of latter-day combination Mother Teresa,Lenin and suburban teenager. (The screen literally lights up though, when the luminous Bernal smiles)<br />While it is true that Guevara and Granado set out on this trip without a care in the world except a hunger to see what is "out there," I have to question the motives of the film maker in presenting this true-to-a-point yet evasive view of Che and all he was to become.<br />With all that said, the film is beautifully and artfully shot by cinematographer Eric Gautier and the mise en scene is cluttered with the beauty that is South America. The duo's bumpy journey by raft, ferry but mostly on foot is characterized by humor, arguing and a deep recognition of how much better they have it than most of the people with whom they come in contact.<br />There are many things that I love about "The Motorcycle Diaries," Bernal and de la Serna for two, but nonetheless I have a lingering bad taste in my mouth about the ritual cleansing of a man who on the one hand said that "the true revolutionary is guided by love" but in reality was more Ivan the Terrible than St Francis.</p></body></html>

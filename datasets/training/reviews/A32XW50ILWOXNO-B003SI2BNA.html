And then it ends. Depressingly. Well, A-plus for consistency.<br /><br />Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) has recently divorced Kyle (Dougray Scott) and moved with her daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade) to a remote, modernist apartment complex on Roosevelt Island in New York City. Dahlia is troubled, near-broke, jilted. Ceci is a cute, opinionated child who wants nothing to do with the apartment until she looks a dark leak in the ceiling and has one of those ghost-induced changes of heart.<br /><br />Who's the ghost? How will it influence Ceci? Why is Dahlia having nightmares about her deadbeat mother? Why are the landlord (John C. Reilly) and superintendent (Pete Postlehewaite) constantly telling Dahlia to call the other to fix her leak? Why does Dahlia's lawyer (Tim Roth) lie about having a family? Will it ever stop raining? Some of these questions have answers. Some of these questions are just used to maintain the movie's disquieting tone.<br /><br />Rafael Yglesias' screenplay works from Hideo Nakata's original movie; like Nakata's "Ring" series, "Dark Water" concentrates on a single mother and her weird kid in a threatening environment as several subplots - what's with all the scenes at the elementary school? - are designed to go nowhere, and indeed don't. That doesn't make them any more satisfactory.<br /><br />Walter Salles deserves credit for his artful direction - he darkens the edges of the frame and employs long shots to heighten Dahlia's isolation and dawning madness -  and discredit for forgetting to make a dramatic film that fails most of all at its blink-and-it's-over climax. As for Connelly - she's already traveled this territory in "House of Sand and Fog" and "Requiem for a Dream." Yes, she falls apart as well as any actress. But again? Roth and Reilly are paying their electric bills, and the kid acts like an alien.<br /><br />"Dark Water" is one visually sumptuous, meditative, trembling blah, blah, blah of a thing. Horror? Norror.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The First is always the best!!"></head><body><p>FRIDAY THE 13TH was the best of the series with a young Kevin Bacon, Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Voorhees.<br />I just watched part 6 the other day it is the only Movie in the series next to the first one that actually have kids come to the camp before all the camp staff gets killed.<br />Plus the first one was the most realistic out of the series until when JASON comes back to life.<br />Even though Betsy Palmer was short lived in the series (Part 1) there is no doubt this the best movie in the series.<br />I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!</p></body></html>

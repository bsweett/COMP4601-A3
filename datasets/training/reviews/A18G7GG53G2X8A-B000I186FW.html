In today's day and age, it's easy to see why that would be hard to accomplish, considering how inhumane most terrorism is. This movie has a way of blurring the line between a nonviolent conscience and a radical need for change, and the fact that it was able to do that fascinated me on so many levels. There are a couple of people to thank for this: first and foremost there are Alan Moore and David Lloyd for creating the original graphic novel; then there are the Wachowski Brothers for adapting the graphic novel into a screenplay; and then there's James McTeigue for his direction.<br /><br />Of course, the cast has to be thanked as well, most notably Hugo Weaving for his incredibly effective portrayal of the shadowy bandit known only as V. What we're shown is a classic antihero character, completely and appropriately surrounded by an air of mystery (which is obviously helped by the fact that he's never seen without wearing a Guy Fawkes mask). It's very much safe to assume that he's not quite normal, both mentally and physically; he seems invincible from the way he fights, but more so, he seems incredibly cultured, not only from his expanded vocabulary, but from his interest in theater and film, as well (he's quite fond of the movie "The Count of Monte Cristo"). The only concrete insight we're given concerns one major event from his past, an event that completely shapes him into a vengeful yet important instigator of society. I dare not say what that event was, nor do I dare say whom he wishes to hunt down and destroy. But rest assured it's one of the most pivotal plot devices in this movie.<br /><br />A lot of ideas presented have been used before: this is a futuristic story (although it's the not-too-distant future) about a totalitarian government and the rebel who decides to take a stand against it. Even though that aspect is fairly unoriginal (all you have to do is read George Orwell's "1984" or see Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner" to see what I mean), the way "V For Vendetta" is told completely makes up for it, especially since it sends a message that a lot of people need to hear. That's probably why it wasn't surprising that the filmmakers included a cop (Stephen Rea as Chief Inspector Finch) who starts out loyal but gradually rethinks everything he's been told to believe. Hints of the Holocaust were added to the mix, as well, and that to me was even less surprising.<br /><br />The not-too-distant future we're presented shows us England under the dictatorship of Adam Sutler (John Hurt). It's a heavily regimented society formed from the devastation of disease and the collapse of major governments (our country is referred to as the Former United States). Maybe that's why Sutler is practically never seen in person; he's a ruler whose face is almost exclusively seen on a greatly oversized television screen (which I'm sure was an intentional tribute to Orwell's Big Brother character). To say he has absolute control over the country would be an understatement; political opposition, homosexuality, and religious freedom are all illegal and punishable by death. (Does any of this seem overwhelmingly familiar?)<br /><br />The vast majority of the population is complacent and fearful. We frequently sees shots of regular families in their living rooms watching their TVs, witnessing the government's propaganda in the form of falsified news bulletins and religious banter (delivered with style by Roger Allam as the despicable Lewis Prothero). You can see the anger and sadness in their eyes as they're being lied to from their own people. At the same time, you can see the unwillingness to do something about it; anyone who's ever faced a dilemma knows the agony of not rocking the boat when they know they should.<br /><br />Things get interesting when we meet Evey (Natalie Portman, who can finally fake a decent British accent). Her past is about as dark and painful as you might expect, and as a result, she has some intense but reserved feelings about the government. She's introduced to V in a back alley after some corrupt police officers attempt to rape her. Right away it becomes obvious that the two were meant to be allies. It's also obvious that she is intrigued yet suspicious of his beliefs and methods. What are not so obvious are his feelings for her, and they remain elusive throughout the film; he's accommodating and witty while at the same time overpowering and distant. These conflicting personalities were eventually foremost in my mind, especially after Evey is kidnapped, questioned, and tortured (but to find out why, you'll have to see the movie).<br /><br />Some may be offended by "V For Vendetta"'s unapologetic views on oppression and freedom, and they certainly have the right to feel that way. Nevertheless, I truly feel that this is one of the most relevant films of the year, especially given the issues and controversies we continuously see in the world. It's by no means just a stylized action thriller, as the television commercials may lead some to believe. Underneath it all, it's trying to convey a serious political message, one that doesn't have to be believed so much as it does have to be heard.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ANG LEE REALLY DESERVED HIS OSCAR"></head><body><p>"Brokeback Mountain" reminded me of Clint Eastwood's "The Bridges of Madison County" by its mood and pacing. It's one of those love stories that really touch your heart. "Brokeback Mountain" is not a simple story, it's about two persons' relationship and this relationship is complex like life itself. Jack and Ennis love each other although none of them are gay as they put it. But Ennis has a wife and two daughters, Jack also has a wife and kid. Besides where they both come from the bonds between two men that are too tight are not appreciated. There's more - they both work as cowboys, usually very manly occupation. But they attracted to each other and they can't do anything about it.<br /><br />This film is about happiness, about how difficult is sometimes to reach it yet it seems to be very close. It's difficult and easy at the same time, you just need to desire it very much. Therefore it's about decisions we make - sometimes wrong, sometimes right, but in the end no one can tell wrong from right. Jack and Ennis could be happy but the price could be the unhappiness of two broken families. Apart from being afraid of publicity they decided not to be happy themselves but also not to ruin the lives of their wives and children. So "Brokeback Mountain" is about moral obligations too.<br /><br />Maybe in other circumstances, in another time Jack and Ennis could live happily somewhere. But the story is set exactly where and when it's set so they had no choice.<br /><br />I guess Brokeback Mountain itself symbolizes every person's dream. It's the place people crave, where they are totally happy. Jack and Ennis were happy there sleeping on the ground, eating beans every day and being cut from the rest of the world. It was their personal paradise. I think if they could they'd live on the mountain, but they couldn't (the reasons don't matter), they've chosen to be happy for a couple of times a year, driving away from everyone else, having just each other, in the place they felt alive. It doesn't matter where they went - even some tatty motel would be their Brokeback Mountain from then on.<br /><br />I think everyone has his own Brokeback Mountain, his paradise, a place where you can be yourself. And it's not always a "place" literally. Some people finally get there and some not. Jack and Ennis couldn't.<br /><br />"Brokeback Mountain" is a beautiful and sad story definately made by a sensitive person. And I'd say it's made for the sensitive. Ang Lee deserved his Oscar for sure. If you liked his "The Ice Storm" and you are not homophobic, you'll apprehend this film.</p></body></html>

And, true enough.<br /><br />While Zwick's film "suffers" from a similar "problem" as Terry George's "Hotel Rwanda" (a critical "story" told primarily through thoroughly Westernized characters), much like George's work this tactic helps garner the attention of the Western world (and, thus, the "problem" is entirely forgivable).<br /><br />While conflict-diamonds have been the subject of countless journalistic-accounts and documentaries, too few Americans seemed to have noticed (BBC News and The History Channel do not seem to be priority-television for many). (And, like many of you, I was incredulous at the posts here which registered surprise that the film has a "message" ... one is forced to wonder, did these people even know of atrocities in Sierra Leone?! Or were they just buying a DiCaprio film?!) Zwick has done an immense service to the world by creating this work ... and DiCaprio and Hounsou for lending their names and talent.<br /><br />Kudos to script-writer Leaviitt for fearlessly tackling the "dirty" side of the diamond-industry. He painted them for the ghouls they really are (The De Beers corporation will happily tell you that they do not buy conflict-diamonds ... what they don't tell you is they have NO real way of knowing ... not even with the Kimberly Process in effect). And though the film concludes with a message to the viewer about demanding conflict-free diamonds, numerous investigations have determined that this process is NOT failsafe and that NO ONE should ever feel confident buying a diamond).<br /><br />In Zwick's work, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) declares that if the Western world understood the horror behind these diamonds, they wouldn't purchase them. I had to pause ... really? Since when do we Westerners (especially Americans) care about the cost of privilege? We continue to support some the most repugnant corporations on this planet. We still buy Nike (guilty of child-labor). We still buy Champion (guilty of child-labor). We still buy Coca-Cola (guilty of directly sponsoring Columbian death-squads). We still buy Nestle (guilty of the deaths of countless African children as a result of the formula scandal). And we still support Citibank (notorious for its environmental destruction). Can this film change minds? Maybe (Hopefully!) Will it just be consumed, discussed over beers at Bennigans, and forgotten? Probably.<br /><br />So what was the ultimate result of Zwick's courageous endeavor? Those in the Western world who have seen this work cannot possibly purchase a diamond without a pang of guilt ... and, for that alone, this film is an epic success. (Even though, I know, Westerners have an uncanny talent for selective-amnesia). Will they still buy diamond rings (and other equally indulgent rubbish)? Probably. But, now when they gaze at those glittering baubles on their hands, maybe ... just maybe ... they will consider those who do not have hands as a result. (Or maybe that's just wishful thinking?)<br /><br />Suggested viewing: The History Channel's "Blood Diamonds." (An in-depth account of the politics and atrocities of the diamond-industry). (Just do a "TV Guide" search for its next airing!)</p></body></html>

(With the Bourne pictures to his credit, he has certainly established his status as an excellent screenwriter, but this is even better and the characters have more nuance and complexity.)  As a thriller, Michael Clayton never drags, and as a complex character study of high-powered people disintegrating it is compelling and credible.<br /><br />Being Bipolar myself, (and having written a book about it), I can assure you that Tom Wilkinson's portrayal of Arthur Edens is dead on and not gratuitous in any way - a refreshing change of pace.  While his dramatic meltdown triggers all subsequent events, he is not alone in having trouble with the mirror.  The film takes us through a spectrum of despicability.  On one end we have the two hit men, coolly dispassionate sharks.  (Actually more ruthless than lawyers!)  Slightly to the right of them is Karen Crowder, (Tilda Swinton).  Her performance deserved the Oscar it received, (although Ms. Crowder is so contemptible as Chief Counsel she may set feminism back a decade or two, confirming men's darkest fears about what happens when women begin to think and act like them).  A wee bit to the right of her is Marty Bach, (Sydney Pollack), who brilliantly embodies the amoral swagger of brutes dedicated to winning at all cost.  Then there is Michael Clayton; the battle for his soul is the film's center.<br /><br />Clooney has been involved in some preachy movies, (Syriana - Good Night, and Good Luck), but this picture avoids that trap.  The chemical company, the law firm's client, is guilty of unspeakable crimes - everyone knows it.  In our legal system, highly paid, smart, resourceful people try their best to help monsters avoid prosecution.  This is not the point of Michael Clayton, simply its atmosphere.  As the film develops we see Clayton coming to terms with what he is.  He is a janitor, a bagman; he has a special gift for cleaning up dirty little messes.  The scene at the film's start, where he's been sent to rescue an obnoxious star client who may have recklessly killed a jogger with his car is one of those "aha" moments.  Not pretty.  In the film's riveting climatic scene - the showdown between him and Crowder, Clayton commits at last, he decides what he wants to be.  There is an intensity and magic in that scene rarely encountered in film.<br /><br />Michael Clayton has everything going for it, production value, cinematography, and secondary players.  The cast is thick with talent.  I was surprised by how many faces were familiar to me from watching Law & Order - maybe that's a talent pool that big guys like to fish.  A smart, dressy thriller that works on every level.</p></body></html>

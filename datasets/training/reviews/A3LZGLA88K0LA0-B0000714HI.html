<meta name="summary" content="YES IT'S FUNNY"></head><body><p>This is my first exposure to Mike Myers and his Austin Powers character and while some of the gags just don't work, the movie is a funny one.  Myers is hilarious as the many characters he plays, and although some of his humor is too flatulent oriented, I have to admit I laughed every time.  Beyonce Knowles is throwaway material but she's effective.  Verne Troyer is a hoot as Mini Me and Seth Green is fun as Dr. Evil's son.  Add a cast of celebrity cameos, especially those in the scene's AUSTINPUSSY opening and you can't help but fall into the movie's maniacal thrust.  Full of fun music from the seventies and some outrageous costuming and dialogue, GOLDMEMBER is fun to watch.</p></body></html>

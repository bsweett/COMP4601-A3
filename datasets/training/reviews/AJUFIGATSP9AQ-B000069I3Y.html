<meta name="summary" content="Smart n Sharp Urban Blues BD"></head><body><p>A city highway bumper becomes a major modern tragedy. The clash and the conflict provide a rich and engaging drama that is rewatchable for enjoyment and a catharthis for your angst. The disc is state of the art; the source is modest. The result is a BD of a great movie that is a relative of Falling Down.</p></body></html>

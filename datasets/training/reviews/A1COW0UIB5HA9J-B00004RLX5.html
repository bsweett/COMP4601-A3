<meta name="summary" content="One of the best ST movies ever!!"></head><body><p>A gigantic alien probe that sends strange whale-like sounds to 23rd century Earth is causing major disasters, only Admirel Kirk (William Shatner), Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Sulu (George Takei), Chekvov (William Koenig), Scotty (James Doohan and Commander Urha (Nichelle Nichols) can go back in time to San Francisco 1986 where they must find two Humpback Whales so they can take them back to the 23rd century so they can use the Whales's calls to stop the probe.<br /><br />Vastly entertaining, sometimes funny and stylish entry of the franchise! Co-starring Catherine Hicks and Michael Barryman ("The Original Hills Have Eyes"), this is one of the best movies of the popular Sci-fi movie series. The direction by Leonard Nimoy is very good and it has humor such as the memorable and hilarious scene where Spock confronts a punk using the Vulcan neck-pinch, excellent special effects, good acting and how the Enterprise crew are trying to get along well in the 80's especially good pacing. It's a wonderful finale to the Trilogy that started with Star Trek II and ended nicely with this one, i strongly recommend this movie for fans of ST, sci-fi and even the whole family for some intergalactic fun.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD Collector's Edition has excellent picture and sound with some great extras like an audio commentary from Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner, Text commentary from Michael and Denise Okuda co-authors of the Star Trek Encyclopedia. Featurettes, Tributes, Storyboards, Production Gallery, Interviews and Trailer.</p></body></html>

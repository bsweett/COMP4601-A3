<meta name="summary" content="The best of the Next Generation films"></head><body><p>Star Trek: Fist Contact is actually Star Trek VIII, and the first feature film containing solely the Next Generation cast.  With Jonathan Frakes (Riker) at the helm as director, veteran TNG screenplay writers Braga and Moore, production designer Zimmerman, and composer Jerry Goldsmith, this film truly contains the best family of TNG artists ever assembled.  The quality of the film reflects this collaboration.  It is far and away superior to either Nemesis or Insurrection, and objectively much better than Generations (although I have a soft spot in my heart for that film).<br /><br />The story - another Borg cube has decided to challenge the Federation, and the fleet assembles for battle.  This time, the fleet fares better than at the Battle of Wolf 359 (as shown in the TNG episodes "Best of Both Worlds" I and II).  The Cube is destroyed, but a small escape ship emerges and vanishes through a temporal (time-travel) rift.  The Enterprise is quick to pursue, knowing that the Borg must intend travelling back in time to change history and/or assimilate Earth in the past.  Our heroes arrive in the year 2063 (just after WWIII in Trek lore) to find the small Borg ship bombarding Earth.  Their target - Earth's first warp-capable ship which allows humans to make First Contact with an alien species and ultimately pave the way for the creation of the Federation and of Starfleet.  The TNG crew must fight off the Borg (who take over the Engineering decks on the Enterprise), set the timeline right (without themselves disrupting it), and save the First Contact event.<br /><br />This must be the most action-oriented film of all the Treks.  There is a big space battle, hand-to-hand combat with the Borg, etc.  However, the soul of the film is still in the interactions between the characters: Worf and Picard disagree about how to best fight the Borg, Picard must rescue Data, Troi and Riker must work together to ensure First Contact, etc.  Even fan-favourite Reg Barkley makes an appearance!  Seamlessly inserted into the cast are Alfrie Woodard as a 21st-century engineer and James Cromwell as Zefram Cochrane, legendary pilot and inventor of Earth's first warp-capable ship.  A word about the soundtrack is appropriate here as well - veteran Jerry Goldsmith delivers a supurb score, weaving in elements of his other Trek scores.  Worf's action scenes are punctuated by the Klingon theme from ST:TMP, the space-walk music is reminiscent of the V'ger theme, etc.<br /><br />So why only the 3-star rating?  Unfortunately, there are a lot of little issues that detract from the enjoyment of the film upon repeated viewings, which is why you buy the DVD, after all.  For example, the first 45 minutes are fantastic - action, suspense, pacing, etc. are perfect.  After that, though, the editors and/or director allow the picture to slow down and it seems to run out of steam.  More alarming are more fundamental story problems.  For example:  the away team loses contact with the Enterprise (when the Borg take over part of it) but never seems concerned.  In addition, we get an extended Moby Dick reference, which is basically a rehash of Star Trek II - there's lots of literature out there to quote, it's sheer laziness to repeat the Moby Dick theme.<br /><br />But the most serious problem is the change wrought upon the Borg, relative to their civilisation in the TV show.  They are given a queen who, apparently, controls the collective consciousness.  Suddenly there is a leader who, when killed, fatally disrupts the collective so it can no longer function.  The original point of the Borg was that they were not hierarchical - the only way to kill the Borg was to wipe out every single one of them.  Now, suddenly, there is a simple magic bullet solution that all you have to do is find and kill the leader?  This completely negates the strength and fearsomeness of the Borg, making them another mundane enemy race.<br /><br />Naturally, I have no complaints about this special edition.  There are lots of goodies here, including three commentaries by (in order of decreasing interest) writers Braga and Moore, Trek guru Okuda, and director Frakes.  There are lots of little featurettes to keep the techies happy, talking about effects, design, etc.  And the price is very reasonable for a DVD of this quality!</p></body></html>

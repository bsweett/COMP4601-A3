Anderson give the most great and complete review.<br /><br />I wasn't sure that I would like the movie but felt it was worth buying.<br /><br />To tell the truth I have never seen a dog like Jack.<br /><br />The Mystery of the Lake House seems to revolve around love.<br /><br />Alex's fathers love for his wife and the house and his son.<br /><br />I loved the fast flag flip.<br /><br />Kate being at Alex's death to save him later.<br /><br />The Lake House finally brought them together.  Time is no obstacle to love.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ---------- most excellent.</p></body></html>

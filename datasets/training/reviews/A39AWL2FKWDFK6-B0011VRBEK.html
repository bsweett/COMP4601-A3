<meta name="summary" content="An ironic tale of retribution"></head><body><p>Chan-wook Park's amazing flick "Oldboy" is a modern day Shakespearean type saga of deceit, vengeance and reprisal played out against a current South Korean setting.<br /><br />Oh Dae-su, played amazingly by Min-sik Choi, is a womanizing Seoul businessman, husband and father of a young daughter who is inexplicably confined in a private prison cell for 15 years.  In his solitude his only attachment to the outside world is a TV.  While watching he learns of the brutal murder of his wife, orphaning his child.  From that point he musters all his power to sharpen himself both physically and mentally for revenge against those who immersed him in this predicament.<br /><br />After being released he embarks on a blood thirsty campaign of vindication.  While doing so he becomes befriended to a young female sushi chef Mi-do played by an innocent Hye-jeong Kang.  They eventually fall in love and she supports him in his quest.  Soon after his released he is outfitted with a cell phone and wads of cash by his tormentor.  It is established that he is to be given 5 days to ascertain the reason for his incarceration by his captor or the life of Mi-do will be forfeited.<br /><br />This last part of the flick chronicles Oh dae-su's voyage of discovery as to the genesis of the deeds that caused his plight.  What is revealed is a stunning sequence of events leading to an unpredictable and ironic conclusion to an extremely well crafted and written plot that is superbly directed by Park.</p></body></html>

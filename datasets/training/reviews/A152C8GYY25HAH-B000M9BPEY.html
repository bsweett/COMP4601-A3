<meta name="summary" content="Slightly flawed but essentially exquisite allegory"></head><body><p>Famed cult director Tim Burton's "Big Fish" was greeted by generally positive reviews, but some of the negative ones were scathing - dull and preachy, belabored, pretentious, long-winded, strained. So, as a Burton fan, it was with some trepidation that I saw the movie. I'm glad I did. It's got its weaknesses - some of the fantasies don't work as well as Burton had hoped they would, I suspect. But, for the most part, it does work as a delicate, almost magical allegory. It also contains some great performances, especially by Albert Finney, Jessica Lange and Helena Bonham Carter.<p>What if, when you were a kid, your father filled your head with fantastic stories of his own youth? Stories about his encounters with a very big fish, amazing exploits in a war, encounters with a giant, his travels to a town that exists in its own space and time, etc.? And you, as a young man, with your limited imagination, could not accept your father's filling you with these stories? What if you could not relate to him because you felt his whole life was a lie? And, finally, what if you discovered that his crazy stories were not, after all, that far from what really happened? What would you do?<p>These and other questions are what confront Will Bloom [Billy Crudup] when he returns home from New York City to the rural South where his father, Ed [Finney] lays dying. Hostile and angry, Will confronts his father. [Of great importance to the story is Will's mother [Lange], who loves Ed unconditionally and is enchanted by his wild tales. But, of course, she loves Will unconditionally as well.] <p>As Will fights Ed, we see flashbacks of the young Ed [Ewan McGregor] living out these improbable tales in sequences of amazing visual detail. At first, Will may have the upper hand, but as we watch, it is Ed who wins the battle and our hearts. He may not have always told the truth, but it is his life, not Will's, which is the more heroic and worthwhile. Will, we learn, merely clungs to surface realities, while Ed has fully embraced the realities that lay just beyond our reach.</p></body></html>

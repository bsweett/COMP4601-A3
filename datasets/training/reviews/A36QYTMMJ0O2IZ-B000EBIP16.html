<meta name="summary" content="This Entry is Good...But Not What It Could Have Been"></head><body><p>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a good film.  The special effects are first rate.  If only they were enough to truly satisfy the viewer, but they aren't.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis's beloved classic novel is given a pretty good justice with this film.  The cast of characters is well thought out...everyone from Lucy to Edmund, Susan, and Peter.  Even the White Witch is casted nicely.<br /><br />So, what is the problem you ask?  There simply isn't enough to really get at the heart and spirit of this story.  The characterizations surrounding the four children is good.  But, the novel focuses just as much on Aslan and the Witch.<br /><br />What happens is that even at 2 hours and 15 minutes, the movie's pace is too fast.  It flies through the story at a break-neck speed that it was never intended to do.  Thus, as it occurs whenever a film-maker "rushes" through a film, key elements are left out.  Not enough time is given to Aslan to really be in awe of this character, one of the most memorable in literary history.  Some key scenes from the novel are either rushed or deleted altogether.  We just aren't given that sense of magic about Narnia, that mystical quality that is so a part of Lewis's books.  His literary style captivates the reader, even though it is written simply, you still feel as if you've stepped through a Wardrobe into a magical kingdom.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the same argument can be said of the White Witch.  Especially in regard to her relationship and treatment of Edmund.  Edmund is a brooding, moody character who is only interested in himself.  That spark of potential cruelty is barely felt in the film.  Until he realizes what he's done, and how the White Witch forces him to pull her sleigh over the rough terrain after the snow has melted, do we get an idea of the true evilness of the Witch.  She is cruel and tempermental.  The deleted scene of the Queen turning a bunch of woodland creatures, who are having a tea party, into stone was left out.  And while we get glimpses of this in the film, it doesn't sink in far enough.<br /><br />The scope of the film is very good.  Wherever it was filmed, you get a sense of the beauty of Narnia that readers have come to expect.  The scenery is incredible and a feast for the eyes.  The way they've brought all of these incredible creatures to life is also magical.<br /><br />As good as this film was, it could have been so much better.  Granted it is geared toward a younger audience, and I think the young kids will be overjoyed with it.  However, I still think they could have gone a little deeper with it.  Just because a film is geared toward younger kids, doesn't mean you have to play "down" to them.  Examples such as the Harry Potter films, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, and many others have shown the kids can handle more than you think and are just as interested in compelling story-telling as the rest of us.<br /><br />I know they are working on Prince Caspian, and I hope they can do more justice to that great novel than they did to this one.</p></body></html>

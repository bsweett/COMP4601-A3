Personally, I could care less if Christ married and had children but I can also understand that this theory would drive groups like Opus Dei over the edge as this would make Christ less a deity and more a human being which would, on the positive side make Him more accessible to the 21st. century than does the porcelain statue planted in your local church.<br />The basic plot of "TDC" is like a treasure hunt and though it is way too long by 20 minutes, there are genuine stretches of time when this film is absolutely fascinating. Unfortunately there are also stretches that are simply boring.<br />Tom Hanks and particularly Audrey Tautou do a very good job of being tour guides through all the dogma, theory, superstition, facts and fiction of this film and its many divergent plot strains and ultimately they succeed in making the film interesting. But what this film really needs is a bona fide task master with a definite, concrete take and a subjective point of view like Robert Altman or Roman Polanski to judiciously edit this subject matter into a more cohesive whole. Ron Howard's downfall is that he tries to make a balanced, objective film and all this accomplishes is a film devoid of personality or pizazz: he tries to be all things to all people and ends up being nothing to anyone.<br />As it is "The Da Vinci Code" is a good movie highlighted by two good central performances and an interesting premise that never really catches fire.</p></body></html>

You get so used to them that you either figure the movie out before it even gets going or you might be scared but you're really simply going through the motions.  Then comes a movie that plays with conventions and, at times, decimates them.  You're no longer in your comfort zone.  You no longer know what's going to happen.  Wolf Creek is kind of like that movie.<br /><br />It begins slowly as a road trip film.  A great deal of the beginning is spent on developing characters (shock!  What a novel concept!).  At times it might drag a bit, but really its all set up.  A lot of negative reviewers have commented that its boring.  I guess in today's society of instant gratification I shouldn't be surprised...but I think the slower start works well for this movie.  There are a couple scenes setting up a feeling of unease in your stomach.  But what the beginning does really well is set you at ease before destroying that ease with one of the cruelest villains seen in today's horror film culture.<br /><br />What happens when the scares start is out of a nightmare.  I'm not going to say anything else about the plot because in the way it plays with conventions, there are some nice little twists in the plot.  It keeps you on your toes.  In fact, if you are an avid horror film buff, you will probably enjoy this movie the most simply because of the way it continues to crush horror film cliches and conventions.  I think that's what impressed me the most about this movie.  As a horror film buff, I sat there and watched in glee as things that normally happen in a horror film were turned on its head.  Also, like a fellow reviewer has mentioned, with a cast of 3 protagonists, there really is no "cannon fodder."  And you never know who will survive and who won't.  I really want to talk more about it but it will ruin some of the little twists that really make this film what it is.<br /><br />The movie is very dark in tone.  It reminded me of the feel of High Tension (another great horror film this year).  The gore isn't as over the top as High Tension which helps ground the film in the possible territory.  And Australia is the perfect location for this film.  The scenes of complete isolation and utter desolation; the kind where you don't know which way is which.  Its disorienting in a way that many horror films try to capture but never fully express.  Some scenes toward the end are so bleak and disorienting you can't help but feel lost and wondering if you were stranded out there what WOULD you do?<br /><br />This has been an "interesting" year for horror films.  On one hand there have been a ton of PG-13 horror films that have catered to the safe and money-making teen crowd.  These films offer mainly the "boo" scare with the loud music and close ups.  The kind of movie people shriek at because they are surprised, then spend the next ten minutes laughing about it.  And there have been a few movies that have been "throw backs" to the 1970/early 80s horror/gore flicks; the really in your face flicks that at one time defined what horror was.<br /><br />One of them took all of the bad parts of those films (The Devil's Rejects) and left out all of the good.  This film did the exact opposite.  What films like The Devil's Rejects forget is that violence for violence's sake does not instill terror.  However, when you care about the characters, like in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and in this film, the violence gets under your skin.  It gets into your head and you find yourself holding your breath that everyone makes it out okay...but knowing full well its not that kind of story.<br /><br />Wolf Creek: a must see.</p></body></html>

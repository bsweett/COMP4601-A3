<meta name="summary" content="MUCH BETTER THAN 3,  NOT AS GOOD AS 1 AND 2"></head><body><p>Could have been as good as the first two except for the presence of a very bland villain, easily surpassed by his beautiful and mean sidekick (Maggie Q). Two months after seeing this film I don't even remmember how the guy met his end.<br />The action scenes are as good as any in the first 3 films but unlike #1 & #2 the action is not limited to one specific place which somehow dilutes the excitment.<br />All in all, a superior action movie.</p></body></html>

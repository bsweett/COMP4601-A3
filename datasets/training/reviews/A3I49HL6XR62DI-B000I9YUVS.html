However, I must also give the remake credit. Unlike boring remakes like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (why did they even bother), The Fog eschews the blood and guts and goes in for plot and character, much like Carpenter's original. Yep, there's some bloodletting, but there is also a gothic love story that is quite interesting. And, for once, Tom Welling (Smallville), who is totally cute, is playing his own age. Just get out the popcorn and enjoy it. The Fog is old-fashioned horror with special effects that rock.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The shortest of the movies, but one of the best ones anyway"></head><body><p>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix wasn't my favorite book from the series but as a movie it's extremely entertaining. I loved the movie but I only have minor complaints. It sorta rushes it's way through the book skipping a few different things. I think Ron on Harry's Quidditch team and being pretty bad was one of the best things about the book. Quidditch however isn't even mentioned once in the movie.<br /><br />  I've seen reviews saying this is the darkest and it is but there's still some charm and I still found it to be very entertaining. Evanna Lynch surprisingly gets most of those laughs every time she's shown as Luna Lovegood. She captures all the strangeness of the character perfectly. Plus she even has such good chemestry with Radcliffe that I would've preferred him getting with her instead of Cho. Also new is Imelda Staunton who does a fine job getting you to hate her and I hated her as Umbridge. That's a compliment since Umbridge isn't supposed to be liked and she succeeds at making you hate her. Helena Bonham Carter is also well casted as Bellatrix Lestrange and does a fine job in the role even if it's a small part. She's perfectly evil as her anyway.<br /><br />  I really think this one has possibly the most charm despite critics thinking it's too dark. I don't even see how Roger Ebert could give the others high ratings but this one only 2 1/2. Order of the Phoenix the book was supposed to be serious with Harry having to deal with getting older and learning not to count on grown-ups. Director David Yates does a fine job with all that but he never makes the film overly dark. When I saw two 2 1/2 star reviews I thought, why is Yates coming back for Half Blood Prince, he's gonna kill the series.<br /><br />  After actually seeing the movie though I think he did one of the better direction jobs. His film probably has the most energy next to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban but his film is probably also one of the more heart-warming Harry Potter films. I just hope that he doesn't rush through too much of Half Blood Prince though, this film was based on the longest book yet it's the shortest movie. I think it well done despite that but once movies take you to the wizard world I'm in no hurry to leave, so I don't mind if they are long, as long as they don't leave out too much. Still though I think Yates made a good movie despite some fans complaining. He made he a book that some fans liked the least into one of the most entertaining films of the series, well I think so anyway.</p></body></html>

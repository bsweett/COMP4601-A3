I was literally blown away. Not only is the story extremely interesting, but the film techniques used will delight your eyes! I've always been a lover of film and how their made and put together, and "Citizen Kane" is the epitome of what a good movie is. <p>Orson Welles' direction of this film is immaculate, especially for someone who was so young when he directed it! You will immediately be drawn into all of the characters in this film. I would highly suggest "Citizen Kane" to any and everyone!!! If you want to watch a captivating and cinematically beautiful piece of filmmaking, watch this film!!!</p></body></html>

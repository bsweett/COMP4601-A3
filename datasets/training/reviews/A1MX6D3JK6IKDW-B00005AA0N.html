<meta name="summary" content="NO HOLIDAY FOR WARFARE"></head><body><p>War certainly does not take a holiday vacation. It is well to remember that one of the key battles of World War 2 (The Bulge) came during pre Christmas, 1944. It could easily have been George Patton's finest hour. This strange, enigmatic leader set two goals for himself-total victory and total self aggrandizement.Brilliantly portrayed by George C. Scott (who refused the Oscar), Patton seemed from the outset to do things his way, as he had in overcoming dyslexia. He came from a moneyed California family and was most certainly not accustomed to being told what to do. His learning in tank warfare helped revolutionize the corps itself. When war came, Patton was certainly ready for it. But is warfare really ever ready for the George Pattons of the world? Indeed, the Nazis respected him more than many Americans. This reviewer certainly cannot see Patton succeeding under President Truman, nor any other Europeaan chieftain except Eisenhower.In any event, "Patton" is certainly filmaking at its best, even if the subject matter may not be.</p></body></html>

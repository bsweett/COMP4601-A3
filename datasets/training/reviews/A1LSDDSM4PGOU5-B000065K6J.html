<meta name="summary" content="more intensity,better kills"></head><body><p>once again death stalks a group of people,who survived a catastrophe they weren't supposed to.if you've seen the first movie,you know how outlandish the premise is.you know,death stalking people according to some grand scheme.well,this movie is more preposterous as they add a few things in order to further the story.the deaths are much more inventive and in some cases much more graphic.the movie is better paced,much more intense and suspenseful than the first one.again,if you can get around the general premise,you'll probably like this movie.and if you've seen the first one,and liked it,the premise isn't something that will bother you.i'm not sure this installment is better than the first.after all, the novelty of the unique and(as far as i know)original premise only works with the first one.but,with a few different elements,i.e,more gruesome deaths,more intensity and suspense,and better pacing,it's at least as good as the original.so,sit back,relax and enjoy.and,once again,just remember to throw reality out the window. 4/5</p></body></html>

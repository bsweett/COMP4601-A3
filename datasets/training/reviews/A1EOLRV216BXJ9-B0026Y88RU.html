<meta name="summary" content="Intriguing twists untangle at the end"></head><body><p>The movie starts off with loose leads, leaving me guessing what's actually going on. Veteran Bruce Willis is the mysterious card and the rookie Nick Fisher seems helplessly tossed between two rivals Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. Lucy Liu is the beautiful neighbor falling for Nick. The intricate plot has everything perfectly explained in the end - a 15-minute climax.  Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley face off one another in the top floor board room, not knowing they are just pawns in the game, not until the end. For people who like Ocean Eleven, Inferno Affairs(Hong Kong), this is a film they will thoroughly enjoy.</p></body></html>

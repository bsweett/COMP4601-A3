<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie, Average HD transfer"></head><body><p>I love this movie, one of the greatest... gore, suspense, thriller, horror, detective etc... I'm assuming most have seen it, if you haven't check it out. I won't review the movie at all, just the quality of the Blu-ray HD transfer... it's average at best. Honestly I don't know what goes into the transfer process, but this seems grainy, so maybe that's the source material they are working with? the original camera work and cinematographic style? etc. Certain movies simply look amazing on Blu-ray others are eh, nothing too eye popping and unfortunately this is just ok. Still worth getting? I guess, I haven't gone back to my dvd version and watched them back to back on my PS3 yet.</p></body></html>

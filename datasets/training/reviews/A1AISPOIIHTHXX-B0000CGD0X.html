<meta name="summary" content="It's striking how this still holds up"></head><body><p>One thing I always hated with certain people is that they label films "undeniable classics" and if you so much as question the film or say it's bad, you're automatically verbally assaulted by people saying how wrong you are and why they're classics. Casablanca I've found that there's lots of people who love the film and will defend it if need be, which is great because it'd be funny if someone wanted to defend let's say, From Justin to Kelly.<br /><br />Rick Blaine owns a bar in a town called Casablanca in the 1940's.  He doesn't really talk to people or share drinks and he barely pays attention to his girlfriend.  Casablanca is under French Vishy control and there's Nazis crawling all over. 2 couriers are killed and papers signed by Charles de Gaulle are stolen. In these papers, whoever signs their name is allowed safe passage out of Casablanca so naturally everyone wants them.<br /><br />All is fine until Victor Laszlo and his wife Ilsa Lund have stopped in the bar. Victor is a kind of a hero fighting the Nazis. His wife however knows Rick personally. They were once lovers in Paris before German troops came in and they split up, leaving him heartbroken on the train platform. So naturally he's upset, like he says: "of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the places of the world she had to walk into mine". And so we're dealing with 2 characters who are conflicted and have to deal with their past and also who gets the papers, which Rick actually controls.<br /><br />A film I think becomes a classic when it almost seems to transcend it's medium, where it's quoted or referenced. Infamous lines in cinema like "hasta la vista baby", "here's looking at you kid", "we all get a little mad sometimes" and music themes like Jaws and Star Wars almost become part of pop culture. Casablanca has quite a few of these with the here's looking at you kid, of all the gin joints..., beautiful friendship and play it again Sam becoming well known quotes in cinema history.<br /><br />Not to mention it's a good film too. There's not a lot of actors/actresses who can tell you so much just by a look. There's a scene where Rick finds out that Ilsa is in his bar. You don't know their history yet just their looks tell you all you need to know. There's some missteps however. There's a scene where Paul Henreid(Laszlo) has a conversation with Rick(Bogart) near the end. Bogart has a long look and almost like assessing this guy and figuring him out. But Henreid just stares blankly almost like he's remembering the lines in his head and it's throughout the film too, he's almost wooden in a way.<br /><br />But, if you ever feel the need to just watch a good film, can't go wrong with this one.</p></body></html>

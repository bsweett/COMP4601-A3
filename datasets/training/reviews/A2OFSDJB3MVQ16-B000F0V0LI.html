<meta name="summary" content="Ford's one and only classic Western--the model for other films"></head><body><p>There has been much controversy over the racism depicted in this movie but I think that's part of what makes a compelling Western for its time period. John Wayne, I believe, portrayed one of his first anti-heroes ever (the other being "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence", another Ford classic) and he even named one of his sons after his character.  I've seen this classic on HD Net Movies and the transfer was fantastic--it's as if the movie was made yesterday and not in 1956!! Of course, too accolades from renowned directors such as Akira Kurosawa, David Lean (he resaw this film several times while making "Lawrence of Arabia"), Martin Scorsese, George Lucas (Star Wars owes quite a bit to this), Orson Welles and Curtis Hanson have helped to push this film into the American Film Institute of all time great Westerns. I guess one flaw I had wished Ford would've removed from this classic is the cornball humor involving Vera Miles, Jeffrey Hunter and an actor who's appeared in later "Gunsmoke" as episodes by the name of Curtis!!  Anyway outside of this quibble, the virtues of this film outweigh its flaws, Wayne himself turns in perhaps his greatest performance here.  Now the question is whether to purchase in HD DVD or Blu-ray (they are both basically similiar as far as I know from previous comparisons)?  To update I did purchase the HD DVD version and it's excellent and in answer to the previous reviewer there is a difference between Standard Def and High Def (HD DVD or Blu-ray) and if he has a 720p or 1080p but if not, he would not notice it.</p></body></html>

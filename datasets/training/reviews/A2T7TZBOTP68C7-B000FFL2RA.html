Early scenes of this film contain some of the most brutal battle action I have seen. Kingdom of Heaven follows Balian, a mostly unlikeable antihero (Orlando Bloom) who goes to Jerusalem at the behest of his dying father, (Liam Neeson) whom Balian never knew.  His father was a powerful man, and he asks his son to protect the innocent Muslims who will die if a certain Knight Templar takes power in the holy city.  Bloom seems miscast physically as the sword hefting and swinging required to survive seems to need much more physical bulk.  Nor does Bloom's warm, sexy, engaging personality shine through this particular character, either.<br /><br />But overall, the film brilliantly explores the root of Muslim-Christian antagonism, the result of which we are seeing today in the same Holy Land, now called the Middle East.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

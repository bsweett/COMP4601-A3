<meta name="summary" content="(Possibly) the most realistic superhero movie ever made..."></head><body><p>`Unbreakable' is one of those films that has aged rather well with me.  When director M. Night Shyamalan first introduced himself to the movie going public in 1999 (`The Sixth Sense' was his second film, but it was the first that got anyone to take notice) he had so much promise, but sadly `Unbreakable' is the only film since that has expounded on that promise.  One day I'll bombard you with a verbal slaughtering of `Lady in the Water', `Signs' and `The Village' (I refuse to see `The Happening'), but until then you can relish in some praise for `Unbreakable'.<br /><br />Shyamalan's answer to the super hero origin story, `Unbreakable' tells of David Dunn, a unhappily married man who lives a rather ordinary (if not bland) life until a tragic train accident adds a new purpose to his life.<br /><br />This is not your average superhero story, and it isn't anything like `The Sixth Sense', so it may be hard for many to completely get into this film.  I remember when I saw it in the theater I was let down pretty bad, and so was everyone else I was with.  We were expecting something like `The Sixth Sense', complete with the scares we felt when watching the 1999 thriller.  Instead, `Unbreakable' is a slow and brooding character study that is more haunting than scary.  Like I said, it has aged well with me.  I appreciate the film much more now than I did when I first saw it (kind of like `The Village', although I still think that `The Village' is a mediocre film).<br /><br />One thing that I really admire about this film is Shyamalan's direction.  Sure, his screenwriting skills have become convoluted and forced as the years have progressed (he tries way too hard, and it shows) but his direction is always near impeccable.  He knows how to capture a mood and tone.  Here, he gives a very dark and gritty atmosphere to the film without ever compromising the comic book feel (the way the film is shot is almost TOO smart).  The characters are shot in ways that accentuate their personalities and eventualities marvelously, using such clever technique to embellish what Shyamalan has crafted on the page.  In fact, upon reflection I think that this direction may be even more accomplished and noteworthy than that of `The Sixth Sense'.<br /><br />The acting is all very appropriate and at times even moving.  Bruce Willis gives the performance of his career in `The Sixth Sense', and he follows that up with yet another very well controlled and admirable effort.  Although he is known for his action films, for me he really shows a depth and range here that he should tap into more often.  Robin Wright Penn is also quite impressive in her scenes, and although Jackson does come off somewhat clich&eacute;d and campy at times, he evokes a genuine chill (as in `down the back of your spine') that captures Shyamalan's vision marvelously.  I actually thought that the films best performance came from Spencer Treat Clark, who understood the balance between his characters fear and admiration of his father.<br /><br />It was stunning and only grows more and more haunting every time I see the film.<br /><br />The idea of the `every man' coming into his own as a superhero has been approached before, but Shyamalan adds a layer of realism to this film by ditching the corny one-liners, ridiculous costumes and unrealistic `super villains' and their dastardly deeds, replacing them with a normal man muddling through realistic dialog, struggling to understand himself in a world with drug dealers and murderers and front page headline stories that you read about everyday.<br /><br />Like I said, this is not your typical superhero story...this is a superhero movie for people who don't like superhero movies.</p></body></html>

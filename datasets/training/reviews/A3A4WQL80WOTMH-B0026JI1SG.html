<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood and Swank: A Nice Team"></head><body><p>Been in my cave too long, as I've only just seen this movie.. Now I'm not sure it hits every point on the believablity scale, but once you accept that a girl this beautiful is still single at 33 and only making just enough to survive at a waitressing job eating scraps that customers leave.. and that on top of all that she wants to become the next Mohammed Ali of women and actually has what it takes to do just that (almost)..... well, once you accept that, you're in for a beautiful ride. Hillary Swank is gorgeous and in spite of all the above mentioned improbabilities, puts in a fantastic performance as Maggie.  Hollywood be damned, she'll win your heart in spite of it all.  And Clint, well, of course his performance is fantastic as usual. Likewise for Morgan Freeman.  If the point of a movie is to get the audience involved on as many levels as possible, entertaining you through and through in the process, then this movie succeeds admirably.  Much more than a female version of Rocky the film tackles some hard issues towards the end.  Always great to see Clint in action and this film is no exception.  "Gran Torino" also featuring Clint in his winter years is another great ride as well.  I'm glad to have seen Million Dollar Baby.  In spite of all its Academy Awards, it's a great picture.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Classic and Brilliant Satire"></head><body><p>Stanley Kubrick's acclaimed dark comedy about nuclear holocaust is among  the greatest film satires ever produced.  To truly appreciate this film it  is necessary to remember its historical context.  It was produced right  after President Kennedy was assassinated and just two years after the Cuban  Missile Crisis.  The whole world was gripped with a profound paranoia about  nuclear annihilation.  Average Americans were spending their life savings  to build bomb shelters in their basements.<p>A strong anti nuke sentiment  was building in the U.S. and anti-nuke protests abounded.  This film was  one of two anti-nuke movies made in 1964.  The other was "Fail Safe"  starring Henry Fonda and Walter Matthau which was a heavy handed drama that  depicted an accidental breakdown of the Fail Safe system that resulted in a  nuclear attack on Russia.  "Fail Safe" conveyed its anti war message  through a realistic dramatization of an accidental war that frightened the  most cavalier of viewers.  "Strangelove" accomplished its purpose through  brilliant satire, turning strident generals and politicians into absurd  caricatures.  The dire nature of the topic at a time when real fear was at  its height produced a catharsis that made this film even funnier when it  was first released than it is today.<p>Kubrick's direction was nothing  short of genius.  The film is laced with so many subtle innuendoes and  ironies; one could see it twenty times and still not find them all.  For  instance, most of the names had sexual connotations.  Strangelove  (perversion), Mandrake (a root to used to promote conception), Merkin  (slang for female genitalia) Muffley (same), Buck (stud) Turgidson  (distended with swelling).  The battle to take over the air force complex  took place with a sign that said, "Peace Is Our Profession" in the  background.  Then there is President Muffley's great line, "You can't fight  in here, this is the War Room!"<p>The entire ensemble gave superlative  performances.  Peter Sellers was marvelous playing three parts.  As the  President, he was deadpan and serious while delivering one hilarious line  after another.  As Mandrake, he was the gentlemanly Brit trying nervously  to reason with a madman.  Finally, his best performance was as Dr.  Strangelove, a crippled immigrant German scientist who kept inadvertently  calling the President, "Mein Fuhrer".  This was Sellers at his zaniest, and  it was some of the best physical comedy I've ever seen.<p>George C. Scott  was perfect as the gung ho war hawk.  He brayed, strutted, and played the  butt kicking military man to the hilt and beyond.  This part was a  harbinger of his most famous role as Patton, where he played essentially  the same character without the tongue in cheek embellishments.  And who can  forget Slim Pickens, who is shown on the cover of the video box riding the  nuke to ground zero in one of the funniest and most famous scenes in the  history of film.<p>This is one of the most creative, witty and effective  lampoons ever done.  It makes its point effectively by poking fun at people  who take themselves all too seriously, and by making us laugh at that of  which we are most afraid.  I rated it a perfect 10.  "AAAAAHooooo!"</p></body></html>

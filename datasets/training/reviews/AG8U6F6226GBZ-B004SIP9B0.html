<meta name="summary" content="A Ditzy Monarchy"></head><body><p>While the acting and the story are mesmorizing, and Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen are perfect as the characters they play in the film, the story certainly displays what a total ditz the royal family is.  In an era where royalty is long out of vogue, the British royals seem not to have noticed.  They think they are beyond human beings.  The Queen cares less for Diana's tragic young death than for a poor stag that's been shot in the mountains.  She's either gone senile or she's batty.  Her husband is even worse as an arrogant, snob who makes crass remarks when he hears of Diana's death.<br /><br />The fact that their son was responsible for the break up of his marriage to Diana because of his adulterous relationship with a married woman and his jealousy over Diana's raport with the people  shows an insensitivity on the royals part beyond belief.  In a family who should have held their spoiled son responsible for Diana's troubles, blamed him only for not keeping her feelings over his infidelity under wraps.  While the country was in grief, the royals snubbed them, looking down upon their so called subjects with no feeling whatsoever.  Charles was not the only one whose marriage broke up.  As I recall the Queen's sister was also divorced, and her other son, Andrew divorced Fergie, so they have little to be proud of in family matters.<br /><br />It's a very good movie and a good reason to get rid of old time royalty.  They should disperse their unbelievabe billions in cash, land, homes and jewels and give it back to their people from whence it came and settle down in a cottage somewhere in the Scottish Highlands.  If they want to keep their mouths shut, and their lives separate from their countrymen, let them return  their wealth to the people and go away.</p></body></html>

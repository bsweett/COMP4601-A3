Upcoming is a revival of "Topper" starring Steve Martin as Cosmo Topper who can see ghosts.  I don't recall if I ever saw the 1988 "Hairspray" musical film; and I sure as shootin' can't afford a trip to Broadway.  So "Hairspray" the film was viewed with a set of fresh eyes; and I liked what I saw.<br /><br />From the first frame, it kept my interest.  It's so significantly different from the summer's movie offerings that it stands out nicely.  John Travolta has been nominated for two Oscars, "Saturday Night Fever" in 1977 and "Pulp Fiction" in 1994.  He does a great job as Edna Turnblad with a look and gestures so different that we believe this is the gal with whom Wilbur (Christopher Walken) is in love.  Walken won a supporting Oscar for "The Deer Hunter" in 1978 and was nominated again in 2002 for "Catch Me If You Can."<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer plays Velma Von Tassle.  It is a pleasure to see her return to the screen after a hiatus.  She has three times been nominated for Oscar: "Love Field" (1992), "The Fabulous Baker Boys" (1989) and "Dangerous Liaisons" (1988).  While this film may not result in nomination #4, she does a great job as the beauty queen whose superficiality is so huge that it leads her to judge everyone by their exterior, whether it be because of race or girth.<br /><br />Amanda Bynes who did a nice job in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FIHN84">She's the Man (Widescreen Edition)</a>, plays the best friend of Tracy Turnblad played by newcomer Nikki Blonsky.  Blonsky has unlimited energy and a smile that could stretch all the way from Baltimore to D.C.  James Marsden from the X-Men films hosts the "Corny Collins Show," a dance teen favorite.  Queen Latifah plays Motormouth Maybelle who works on the show once a week when blacks are allowed.  Latifah's lone Oscar nod was for "Chicago" in 2002.  Brittany Snow plays Amber Von Tussle who models her mother's example of perfect hair, perfect dress and perfect superficiality.  Snow has done a lot of TV work from "The Guiding Light" to "American Dreams" to "Nip & Tuck."  Zac Efron plays the local favorite teen dancer Link Larkin.  Taylor Parks does a nice cameo as Little Inez who dances up a storm on the final live TV craziness.<br /><br />The pacing, music and dialogue kept me riveted throughout the film and had me leaving the theatre with a big smile on my face.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

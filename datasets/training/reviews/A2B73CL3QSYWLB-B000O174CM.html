Not having seen the film at the time the nominations were announced, I was taken aback nonetheless by it's shutout in the Best Picture category because of it's win at the Golden Globes and the pre-nomination forecasts.  Having now seen the film my feeling is it wouldn't have been out of place in the Best Picture category but 2006 was a strong year for pictures.  I can think off the top of my head three films that also could very well have been nominated("Blood Diamond", "Children of Men", "Pan's Labyrinth").  As far as Alan Arkin's upset of Eddie Murphy in the Supporting Actor category, well, the Academy got it right in my humble opinion.  For sure Murphy's account of James "Thunder" Early was an impressive piece of acting it brought to my mind Murphy's send-up of James Brown on "Saturday Night Live" 25 years ago.  I was more impressed with Murphy's work in "The Nutty Professor" in 1996 which he won a New York Film Critics Circle award for.  As for Jennifer Hudson, there should have been an inquest if she were denied the Best Supporting Actress award.  It's been years since an actress has come on the scene and dominated a picture like Hudson does here.  When she's not on screen, the energy level of the picture goes down slightly.  Her showstopper, "I'm Telling You I'm Not Going" should be listed as one of the classic moments of American film.  I remember when Hudson was on "American Idol" and she was criminally voted off early in the competition.  I think alot of it had to do with the unseemly harsh criticism directed at her by Simon Cowell.  Hudson maintained her dignity but was no shrinking violet in the face of these barbs.  My gut tells me that Hudson chanelled that experience into her performance here.  Jennifer got her revenge on Simon.  As for the film itself it's a better-than-average fictionalized account of the Supremes story.  Hudson's song aside, the music is good but not indelible.  What distinguishes the film is the superb ensemble acting.  Oddly enough, the underrated Danny Glover got scant mention in the film's reviews.  My guess is that he is so consistent that he tends to be overlooked.  If the film has a weakness I would have to say it's the film's ostensible star, Beyonce Knowles.  Knowles is extremely attractive and a very good singer but she leaves a little to be desired in the acting category.  The makers of the film, cognizant of this, cleverly tailored the film around Knowles' acting deficiencies.</p></body></html>

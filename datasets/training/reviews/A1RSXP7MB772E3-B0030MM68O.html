It thrillingly gives you a glimpse into a group of EOD soldiers (Explosive ordinance disposal) as they tackle one unforgiving situation after the other.<br /><br />I was always at the edge of my seat in anticipation of the dangers that lurk around every corner. It's a terrible feeling at its worst because this movie portrays how some EOD soldiers actually work in Iraq. After seeing this film, my father remarked how hard, and terrible it is for them to do their life-threatening jobs. Forget politics or whatever you may hear about this movie and see it for yourself.<br /><br />I highly recommend this award winning film. It is outstanding in many important aspects, the most impressive in acting. The script has a documentary and also classic story line feel to it. Again, I think highly of this film, and it MAY be one of the best movies of the year for last year (2009).</p></body></html>

However, the first one was so good, it would be very hard to top it. It's possible, but not likely. And let me also say, that in this case, I don't like it when I'm right.<br /><br />The opening sequence, rather than the Blitz of the first film, we are thrown into the Prince running away for some reason, on the advice of his mentor, who strangely looks like a Hogwarts professor reject. Five minutes later, I'm already bored. Then we are introduced to the kids from the first movie, whose last name I will not even try to pronounce. Things are noticeably different for them. Susan has taken to lying in order to brush pompous boys off her shoulder, and Peter has taken to fighting with anybody that gives him the slightest bit of cause to do so. Why the personality changes? They long for Narnia, and are growing impatient, after all it has been a year. Then just like that, Narnia appears not in a wardrobe, but in a train station.<br /><br />When they get to Narnia, things are also different, there's ruins, and some creatures don't talk, and most of the rest are restless to say the least. The dwarfs for example are utterly useless and annoying, and I was actually rooting for them to be expended by the end. You know, these are the creatures who were reduced to working for the witch in the last movie? Which they say they would gladly do again.<br /><br />The children eventually join forces with the Spanish Prince, and decide to get the prince back his throne, using lots of useless violence. First they storm a castle, which doesn't end well. Mostly due to Caspian, who also becomes quickly unlikable. And his character only gets worse, climaxing in a scene where the dwarfs summon demons and other scary stuff that force Caspian use his blood to bring back the witch from the last movie. And this is a family movie?<br /><br />Note to Andrew Adamson: What in the heck were you thinking here?<br /><br />Then there's a swordfight with Peter and the evil king, who is eventually defeated, only to be quickly replaced by a worse guy, who is quickly defeated in an almost cameo by Aslan. What the deal there? The Lion doesn't appear till the end of the movie, and his part is so minor that it could have been easily rewritten for another character to save the day? Then the movie ends.<br /><br />Many words on the ending: Again, utterly pointless and forced. Why exactly are the children so willing to go back to "earth?" I mean, they were so mad at the beginning about not being there, then they get no leisure while they are there, and are confronted with nothing but trouble, and they're so willing to leave. They're basically like, 'Yeah, that's nice, ready to go back now, see you later, take care.' And then Peter and Susan aren't coming back? And I totally missed the point there. They've learned everything they can learn? If anything, Lucy and Edmund learned more, while the older ones kept screwing up.<br /><br />Note to Andrew Adamson: What the heck were you thinking?<br /><br />Then there's the kiss. What's the point of that, exactly? Did some movie exec say, 'Where's the kiss? We can't have a cute boy and girl without sexual-tension!' Again, like the rest of the movie, forced and pointless. They kiss, and they'll never see each other again, even though they didn't really care that much about each other in the first place.<br /><br />Now, don't think I didn't like the movie... well, never mind, I didn't. But there was some good points... There was Lucy! And there was the cute Badger, who had no role! And how could we forget the mouse? The cute mouse that your love for just boils over everytime you see it, except for its last scene.<br /><br />Wait, I forgot one last thing. When I really thought 'what the heck' during the actual movie, instead of thinking about it while trying to sleep after I got back home from the theatre, was when the trees came alive and started "fighting" the enemy. If that isn't the most lazy steal from The Lord of The Rings ever, I don't know what is. And that was actually one of the better parts in the whole series.<br /><br />Note To Andrew Adamson: What the heck?<br /><br />Overall, while your little children will like most of the movie, mostly thinking about the mouse, you will cringe thinking about the movie afterwards on almost every aspect. In fact, you'll think, why did I even pay to go and see the movie? But, if you take it for what it is, you'll like it better. My major problems with the movie was mostly the bad writing. Bad characters, bad scenes, bad story, and terrible ending.<br /><br />Hopefully, if there is a third one (and Disney will think twice before going any farther on the third one), it will be better, as it is being helmed by fresh eyes. It will still lack half of the main cast, but hey, at least I'll have zero expectations for it. And when you have no expectations, you can't easily be disappointed.</p></body></html>

The film opens slowly, with Tarrantino employing great restraint and craftsmanship, using beautiful landscape cinematography and slow, deliberate pacing. The camera lingers on the brilliant Austrian actor Christoph Waltz (who steals the show: he was nominated for a "supporting actor" Oscar, but he is clearly the movie's real star, playing a vain, sadistic SS officer who loves elaborate cat-and-mouse games.)<br /><br />Tarrantino also uses misdirection in the film -- the Dirty Dozen-ish commando group of the film's title actually get little screen time, and are quickly decimated by their Nazi foes; Brad Pitt, the nominal star of the show, does very little onscreen and has few lines (although he looks a lot like Clark Gable, which is fun...)  Also, despite the marketing campaign, there isn't that much graphic violence: again, this is probably a conscious homage to the war epics of the '60s, which featured a lot of set-up before their Rube Goldberg-like climaxes, where the grand plan unfolds. The ending, which is preposterous and ahistorical, is a real hoot, a gratifying anti-Nazi wish-fulfillment... Like the film itself, it's pure entertainment and fantasy. And why not? Isn't that what films are supposed to be about?  This isn't immortal art, but it sure is a fun movie. If you grew up watching old war films on Saturday afternoons and afterschool TV blocks, then this flick is for you. Tarrantino really nailed it.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)</p></body></html>

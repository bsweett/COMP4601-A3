<meta name="summary" content="DEFECTIVE DVD'S BEING SOLD!"></head><body><p>DO NOT PURCHASE IT. THE THEATRICAL RELEASE IS EXCELLENT QUALITY. THE DVD IS DEFECTIVE. IN THE THEATRE THE TREES AND PLANTS IN THE FOREST ARE GREEN AND BEAUTIFUL. THE SUNLIGHT IS BEAUTIFUL. THE BLOOD IS RED. THE CREATURES AND ACTION ARE SUSPENSEFUL AND EXCITING TO WATCH. THE DVD IS HORRIBLE. THE TREES AND PLANTS ARE BLACK, THE BLOOD IS BLACK. THE SCREEN GOES BLACK MANY TIMES. YOU CAN'T SEE THE ALIENS OR THE PREDATOR DETAILS. YOU SIMPLY ONLY HEAR THE MOVIE BUT CANNOT WATCH IT. IT IS AN OBVIOUS FACTORY PRODUCTION FAILURE. I ENJOYED IT AT THE THEATRE. I WAS FURIOUS WHEN I TRIED TO VIEW THE DVD. I ONLY WATCHED ABOUT 40 MINUTES OF THE GARBAGE BEFORE I TOOK IT OUT OF THE DVD PLAYER. I SENT MY COPY BACK AS DEFECTIVE.</p></body></html>

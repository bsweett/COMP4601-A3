<meta name="summary" content="Get off the phone buddy!"></head><body><p>Phone Booth Colin Farrell is a suspensful thriller and of course more than half of the film is based aroung a disturibing phone booth call. Kiefer Sutherland supplies the creepy voice as the caller. Katie Holmes isn't the worst actor in this movie, the girl who plays Farrell's annoying wife, jeez she deserved a Razzie Award for that over-the-top performance! Forest Whitaker doesn't get to show his acting chops and by the end you never want to make a call again. This film is a mixed bag for me.</p></body></html>

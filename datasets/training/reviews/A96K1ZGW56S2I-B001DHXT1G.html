The show's executive producer, Kenneth Johnson, is a master storyteller and realized that if you tell a story that's nothing but action with no characterization, you don't have much of a story.  I was excited to see Ang Lee's 2003 HULK movie when it was released in theatres, but like many viewers was disappointed.  The film was a huge box office bomb and was stoned by most critics.  After that, I thought that would be the last we would see of the Mean Green Machine on the big screen for awhile.  But, Marvel wasn't ready to give up on one of their most famous characters soon announced plans for another Hulk film.  They promised that the movie would be a better film and would relaunch the character into cinema stardom.  The big wigs at Marvel believed in the project so much that they bet their future as an independent film company on it (IRON MAN was the other film that the studio hoped would turn them into a film studio of reckoning).  At first I was skeptical about the project, but then I learned Ed Norton had signed on to star as Bruce Banner and I felt better about the whole thing. The result is THE INCREDIBLE HULK: an action comic-book movie full of character development that stays true not only to the spirit of the original comic book, but the beloved 1970s television show as well as loosely connecting with 2003's HULK.<br /><br />The movie opens five years after HULK ended.  If viewers will remember, the movie ended with Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) living in South America.  He's (Edward Norton, now) still there and has been able to stay completely off the grid and below the radar, even though he has secretly been looking for a cure for his "disease".  Correspondence with a Mr. Blue in the United States have made him very hopeful and he plans to visit Mr. Blue in the near future.  However, those plans are thrown out of balance when the military, led by top soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) and under the official command of Gen. Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), discover Banner's location and seek to bring him in.  The confrontation is a disaster, Blonsky's troops are wiped out and Blonsky is critically injured.  Meanwhile, Banner escapes and finds his way to the U.S. to meet with the love of his life, Betty Ross, and attempts to locate Mr. Blue in hopes of eradicating the monster within.<br /><br />I really enjoyed THE INCREDIBLE HULK. It's not the best comic book/super hero movie ever made, but it is a good one and is just a very entertaining and exciting overall film.  The acting is superb, the special effects are great, there's just the right temperance of character development and action, etc.  The film does a superb job of synthesizing the previous incarnations of Hulk and uniting them together in a coherent whole that both geeks and casual film-goers alike can enjoy.</p></body></html>

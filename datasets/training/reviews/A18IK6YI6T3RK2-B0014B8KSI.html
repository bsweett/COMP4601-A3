This movie really draws you in, Clooney infuses his eponymous character with interesting flaws and ticks and Wilkerson is fantastic in his Oscar nominated role as a bipolar law genius who has grown a conscience.  Tilda Swinson is perfect in her role, she gives her character that could have just been seen a pure evil caracture; nuance and depth.  Well made thiller, definitely worth your time.</p></body></html>

The pacing is first-rate, the comedy is well done, and the special effects are........well, do I really need to say anything? They practically speak for the whole movie. And the cast is perfect; Sam Neil as Dr. Alan Grant (one of his best roles), Laura Dern as his partner, Jeff Goldblum as the eccentric Dr. Ian Malcolm (hence came the now-famous line &quot;Must go faster! Must go faster!&quot;, which he hillariously repeated three years later in &quot;Independence Day&quot;, which is just as good). The scenery and location are also A+ material, from dense jungles to wide open plains.<br /> I'm definitely going to get this on DVD...probably in the &quot;Jurassic Park Trilogy&quot; 3-pack boxed set. It's to bad the sequals weren't as good, but then again, they never are.</p></body></html>

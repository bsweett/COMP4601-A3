I'm not a big western-fan either, but this one I really enjoyed. Great camera-work, beautiful landscape, good acting (don't misunderstand me now, I like Costner as an actor - but has the man really only just one expression on his face?) especially Mr.Duvall did a great job (as usual). Yes, it's the best western-movie I've seen in years - and though it perhaps took a little too long before the end-credits went rolling after the &quot;showdown&quot;, well for me the mighty action-scene there at the end of the movie made it worth it. This gives a whole new meaning to the expression &quot;When the going gets tough...&quot;<br /><br /> And what a sound! The sound-effects are really that great I think, if you haven't seen this movie - see it in DTS if you have a capable speaker-system and you'll probably love it. The gunshots sounded almost real!<br /><br /> So all in all: Sometimes the movie seems a little slow, and you may feel that it could have been edited some more, perhaps no great surprises in it either, but I never got bored (then I must add that I didn't have the highest expectations before I rented it) - and the ending lived up to my expectations, and it wont take too long before I'll see it again. Good to have you back, Mr.Costner =)</p></body></html>

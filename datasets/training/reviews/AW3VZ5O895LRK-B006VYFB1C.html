<meta name="summary" content="brad pitt becomes billy beane"></head><body><p>this is one of brad pitt's very best performances.  he buries himself underneath general manager billy beane of the oakland  baseball team. he looks average.  he has a down home manner when he relates to other people. you completely believe that he is billy and not brad pitt.  this is not achieved through five hours in a makeup chair either.<br /><br />we have another all star in the making of this movie too by having aaron sorkin as the screenwriter.  sorkin writes brilliant script after brilliant script.  The Social Network was just one of these.<br /><br />jonah hill as the yale grad in econonmics is great as billy's sidekick, pete.  it is his idea that you can create a better team by not going after stars but by instead analyzing their worth and abilities by computer program. billy and pete build an entirely new team using this radical new premise.  they thus can build a more competitive team with the money they have since they do not have the money to go after stars.  i wish MARGIN CALL had been able to explain the economics in its premise as well as Sorkin does the economics of baseball.<br /><br />a lot of the dramatic tension in the film comes from all the underlings to billy who absolutely want to stick to the old way of doing things, especially the coach played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. all in all, it is an excellent film about a little known but all important aspect of professional baseball.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bruce Willis could have saved Edward"></head><body><p>He could have appeared in his trademark vest, with machine gun at the end to save Edward (Nicholas Cage). He didn't and I was grateful for that. So is it as awful as most of the reviewers here are making out? Well frankly no. Its actually a decent film, especially if you haven't seen the original version (which I strongly recommend you watch first). Nicholas Cage does his usual good acting job and is as always is very watchable. Ellen Burstyn is very good but woefully under-used. Its not badly directed and the core of the story is mainly similar to the original play.<br /><br />The problem with this film IS the original version. The original is better in nearly every respect and whilst this isn't a shot for shot remake like the stupid remake of Psycho a few years ago, its pretty close and because of that rather pointless. Key elements from the original film are missing from this version. Most importantly Nicholas Cage's character isn't devout, he isn't really even tempted by the women, so the reason for him being 'chosen' is pretty unclear.<br /><br />So its not a bad film, but for anybody reading this please see the original version first, then watch this.</p></body></html>

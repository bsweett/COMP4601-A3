<meta name="summary" content="'The Wrath of Khan' A Magnificent Masterpiece"></head><body><p>Though THE MOTION PICTURE began the Trek movie endeavors, it was STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN that really brought out the best for Trek fans everywhere. With magnificent battles, thrilling special effects, and the superb acting of Ricardo Montablan, THE WRATH OF KHAN is a thrill-ride from start to finish. I also liked seeing Kirstey Alley as Lt. Saavik, and she does a surprisingly nice job as the curious and charming Saavik. And Berritt Mutrick does a splendid job as the son of Kirk. <p>THE WRATH OF KHAN deals with the story of Khan's return, and his plans to snag his hands on the Genesis Project for his own deadly plans, and when he hijacks the USS Reliant and its crew, Kirk and the crew must stop him before it's too late. The battle scenes, especially in the Motara Nebula, are brilliant, and well done. You'll find yourself satisfied after you watch this movie, and left with a feeling that it got more than just it's job done for all the Trek fans.<p>THE WRATH OF KHAN also concludes with the "temporary" death of Spock, who gave his marbles to McCoy so that it would be possible to revive him in the next movie, THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK. Exhilirating, fast-paced, and with great savvy intelligence, this is one Trek you'll want to watch again and again! Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

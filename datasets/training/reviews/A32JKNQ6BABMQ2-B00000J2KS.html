<meta name="summary" content="the second best movie ever."></head><body><p>this movie is adapted from the best book ever of the same name by anthony burgess.in the book,there is a glossary in the back 4 pages long front and back.the glossary defines the nadsat language used throughout the book.what is nadsat?a made up language the author created himself that the teens speak in the future.in the movie they make it understandable.example:i had a pain in me ol gulliver or head you know?gulliver means head.theres alex and his 3 droogs who go out at night and get into felonious mischief errrrrrr i mean a bit of the old ultra-violence.i mean they gang rape a chick and force her husband to watch,play hogs of the road where they drive up the wrong side of the road to make people crash and all sorts of stuff like that.then they stop by the korova milk bar..............youll love this place...................and get some milk plus.plus what?synthamesc or drencrom or velloceet..........drugs!it is not,i repeat not,for kids.theres nudity in all sorts,rape,violence with beethoven playing,naked jesus figurines.................it never stops.anyhow,the main character eventualy is thrown in jail.they want to try a new technique on him that makes him become physicaly wracked with pains at the very thought of being bad.this includes fighting,illicit sex,raising his hand in anger,defending himself,you name it.the director is stanley kubrik.this is his masterpiece!thats saying a lot since hes also cooked up such classics as spartacus,lolita,2001;a space odyssey,the shining,full metal jacket and eyes wide shut.it looks low budget but everything in the 70s does to me.a lot of people are turned away by the rape scene and shows of nudity going further than full frontal.then again some people are heterosexual and like seeing naked chicks.there are a couple places where id say there is lewd things going on,but they are brief.the main character alex was portrayed extremely well.his buddies-droogs are petie,georgie and dim-dim being really dim.hes not all that well played out but is light years ahead of his time since now its commonplace to have a unbelivably stupid character in every show and movie.it is pretty well consistent with the book.the book is far better and way worse.and since the book is longer,i will let the cat out of the bag.the movie and in u.s. print,end with alex laughing about getting released.the book in england and many other countries has a lost chapter where he also grows up and reforms for real.the part where the shrinks are making hi m incapable of bad involves them showing him very graphic violence and forcing him too watch.this mixed with thier meds makes for a very intense scene.one show he viddies is even aconcentration camp scene with beethoven playing in the background.kubrik is to film what mozart was to music or the beatles to rock or hendrix to guitar.this is his best work!</p></body></html>

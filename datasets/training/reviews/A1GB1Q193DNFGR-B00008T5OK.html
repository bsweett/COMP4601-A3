<meta name="summary" content="The Alps Are Alive With the Fervent Sounds of Musical Bliss"></head><body><p>There's definitely not much that hasn't already been said about Robert Wise's haunting classic musical epic, &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot; With its unforgettable musical numbers, Julie Andrews (Mary Poppins) shining perfectly in the zenith of her virginal appeal, Christopher Plummer playing an engaging love interest, a fantastically optimistic and engaging Ernest Lehman (North By Northwest) screenplay that produced sympathetic character stereotypes (note the Von Trapp children roles), an inspirational rendition of the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein songs, and knowledgeable direction by seasoned film maker Robert Wise (The Haunting, Sand Pebbles). The Sound of Music survives as one of the most beloved Hollywood musicals of the 20th century, but due to its many dated 60's characteristics, does the Sound of Music continue to deserve the immense attention and fanfare that it has received since its 1965 release?<p>Looking previously at the film's long lasting legacy as the cinematic pinnacle of human decency and morality, the Sound of Music entertains countless new generations despite of it's lack of developed performances, adherence to predictable relationships, reliance on routine plot developments, spontaneous transitions into inane songs, and an overabundant sentimentality that oozes sometimes over excessively onto the screen.  However in spite of its obvious shortcomings, the Sound of Music is an overwhelmingly dazzling display of the musical at its most entertaining and inspirational. This film is a testament to the Hollywood's gift of providing magically poignant entertainment to masses.  <p>I for one detest the musical's trust in positive conclusions, silly choruses, and predictable romantic stories. Yet the Sound of Music remains an awesome remainder that greatness can still come out of the most unlikely of places.<p>Sidenote: 20th Century Fox's Five Star Collector's edition of the Sound of Music is a bravura achievement in providing a magnificent anamorphic widescreen presentation, a fascinating Robert Wise commentary track coupled with the musical tracks of the classic songs without verbal dialogue, a commemorative documentary, the theatrical trailers, and much much more. A Must-Buy for any lover of musicals of sixties cinema.<p>Interesting Facts: The Sound of Music won several Academy Awards in 1965 including: Best Picture, Best Director (Robert Wise), and Best Musical Score.</p></body></html>

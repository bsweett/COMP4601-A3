<meta name="summary" content="Guillermo del Toro's dark fantasy"></head><body><p>The year, 2006, was the year of the Mexican director with 3 of the most prominent films directed by Guillermo Del Toro, Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men) & Alejandro Gonzalez Inirritu (Babel). Of the 3, Del Toro's "Pan's Labyrinth" stands out as a skillful blending of fantasy & reality.  It's no surprise to me after seeing his previous films like "Mimic", "Devil's Backbone", "Blade 2" & "Hellboy" that this film would be a skillful brew. Like "Backbone", it is set against a civil war and we are shown how a child copes with this horror. The colorful photography and special effects especially shine in Hi-def (I have this in HD DVD) and you won't be disappointed. For further proof, check out Stephen King's review of this film also.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well performed visual masterpiece"></head><body><p>Musicals are running amok in Hollywood and theatregoers were treated to at least 3 of them (there may be one I missed) with the gentle and lovely Once, the movie turned broadway musical turned movie Hairspray, and artistic visually stunning Across the Universe.  While Hollywood likes churning out Broadway adaptations regularly (in the case of Hairspray), these unusual experimental musicals are welcome.  Once was my favorite this year.  Across the Universe was the most stunning.<br /><br />Across the Universe is set up for failure though.  It's a jukebox musical, right?  To me, those are dreadful, big Vegas style romps that try to gain a narrative from splicing well known hits together.  Across the Universe has the Beatles songbook, with songs too well known it seems to generate enough originality.  But the film has a weapon in the form of Julie Taymor, who has proved her artistic weight in gold.<br /><br />If you're reading this, your are by now familiar with the setup.  It's a love story in the middle of the social unrest of the 60s, set largely against the Vietnam War and all that came with it: civil unrest, peace rallies, protests, and drugs.  When the setup is clear, you realize the Beatles songbook was, in fact, a narrative for the times.  Songs like "Revolution," "Helter Skelter," and "Happiness is a Warm Gun" are at home here.<br /><br />But narrative aside, it's the visuals that steal the show.  Across the Universe is like a long form music video.  Yet the story is cohesive and the imagery for the songs brings the story to life.  The two that stick out in mind very clearly are "She's so Heavy," which in the film makes a dramtic statement about the draft at the time - complete with freaky looking Uncle Sam's with excellent choreography, and "Strawberry Field's Forever," which is a dramatic duet from the two male leads while one struggles with his art and love and the other struggles in the Vietnam War.  After you watch the film, you may not be able to help but pair up some of the images with the Beatles songs.  There's also some notable cameos, and while Bono's is well publicized, it's Eddie Izzards take on Mr. Kite that steals the show.<br /><br />The film suffers only from it's grand ambition.  Notably, there is a little character clutter.  This seems to be the case with the character of Prudence, who's appearance seems superfluous, appearing briefly 3 times in the film, once so someone can sing "Dear Prudence" to her.  To me, however, this was the only major misstep.<br /><br />Across the Universe is a visual marvel and takes the musical into experimental realms not yet explored in the general Hollywood arena.  The talented cast executes the Beatles songbook quite well and demonstrate that pop stars don't need to dominate a musical.  Taymor combines the performances with imagery I guarantee you haven't seen in a musical before.  The visual achievements alone make it worth the while.  The music isn't half bad either.</p></body></html>

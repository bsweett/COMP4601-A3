The  effects great, the acting is great, the paranoia they expieience is magnificantly done, the horror is great the gore is great. There is not nothing to say about this movie negative. It never gets boring and just keeps you focused. When the head turns into a spider is just an aweseom part funny and bugged out but very well done, the way it sprouts legs is just cool as hell. With  out a doubt this is one of the  top 5 or 6 horrors ever made, IMO atleast. $14.99 is great , but if it was $21.00 or $24.00 it is still worth it, a movie that you will be able to always watch. Forget renting go out and buy.</p></body></html>

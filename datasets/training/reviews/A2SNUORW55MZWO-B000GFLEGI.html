<meta name="summary" content="Is The Franchise Dead?"></head><body><p>Okay, so this is a must see because it is part of George Romero's zombie saga, however I didn't really like this one too much. The special effects were great, however the story itself wasn't all the way there. I enjoyed the part of the story where the rich have isolated themselves and the poor have taken to the city streets, but the part of the story that I really did not like was the zombies forming their own army to take on the humans. I thought that the main zombie was horrible. Terrible acting and he looked silly. The way the zombies gather and follow him to the city and then they walk underwater through a river??? What was that all about? The plot about the weaponized vehicle being stolen and held for ransom, I just thought it was stretching things a bit. Of course it has some great moments too, like the whole fireworks thing was very cool. But ultimately this movie ended and I felt like it wasn't up to par with the other "Dead" movies. I give it 3 stars and probably won't ever watch it again. It's simply not a classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE GREATEST GIANT MONSTER FILM OF ALL TIME!"></head><body><p>I am a huge fan of stop motion effects and what better example of this process than King Kong! Harryhausen would take over as king of Stop Motion, but without Kong, there would be no Harryhausen!<br /><br />This is one of my favorite movies of all time and the DVD is nothing short of spectacular! Not being old enough to have seen this iconic film in a theater, I was finally able to watch it in my home theater on a 10 foot screen! As the movie began I was amazed how clear the print was and I noticed little things I had never seen before. This is pretty amazing considering I've seen this film over 100 times. The sound is mono, but it's very clear and would be hard to really improve on this. The film holds up amazingly well and is the definitive giant monster movie!<br /><br />King Kong is the ultimate adventure film and I doubt it will ever be surpassed. One of the most intriguing things about this film is that Kong is a rampaging monster and never steps out of character, but in the end when he's being attacked on top the Empire State building, you can't help but feel sorry for him! Never has an eighteen inch puppet ever evoked so much sympathy! It truly is a masterpiece and I can't even imagine never seeing this film!?<br /><br />The second disc in loaded with wonderful bonus features including two long and interesting documentaries. I bought the box set which includes the original Mighty Joe Young and Son of Kong on separate discs, which are sold separately for those who only want certain films in this set.<br /><br />All three films are great examples of Stop Motion, so it's an essential set for fans of the genre. The set includes the same 2 disc special edition of King Kong and two other classic stop motion films! All the films have been re-mastered and look better than ever!<br /><br />I know that many were disappointed that the original "spider" sequence was not included on the Kong set, but the footage has yet to be unearthed! They did the next best thing and it is interesting to see the re-constructed scene.<br /><br />I had reviewed this film several years ago, but somehow it disappeared!?</p></body></html>

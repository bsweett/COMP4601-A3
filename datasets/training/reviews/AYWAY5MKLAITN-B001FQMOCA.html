It enlightens you of how he got his start, what famous people he hung around with, what torments he had to suffer, and what he had to offer the world . . .a new sound.<br /><br />Jaquin Phoenix does a remarkable job in filling the big shoes of the rock legend. He's so convincing that, at times, I had to remember that he was an actor and not the real Johnny Cash. But, I would say that Jaquin Phoenix deserves an award for completely giving you the natural performance of Johnny Cash's life and memoirs. This movie made me fall in love with Bio-pics all over again.<br /><br />Reese witherspoon, in a depature from her regular movies, plays a convincing June Carter who is slightly interested in the mysterious, yet humble, sometimes crazy confident Johnny Cash.<br /><br />This movie is definetley for those who want to relive what it was like in the 1950's - 1960's when the dawn of a new sound in music emerged and said, "Hello, I'm Johnny Cash."<br /><br />It's a really great movie. A definite "must have."<br /><br />This movie makes the legend of Johnny Cash come alive!!!</p></body></html>

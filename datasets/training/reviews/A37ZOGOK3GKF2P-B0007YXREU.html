At one point I wet my pants, ruptured my spleen I was laughing so hard.  Trey and Matt may very well be the next Mel Brooks, OK the next John Waters is more like it.  This is a sick, twisted, and deviant ride into hillarity.  It reminds me what the "Thunderbirds" would have been like if everyone had been really drunk and said what ever was on their minds at the time.  Celebrities, political leaders, religious leaders, americans, the military, cats, dogs, everyone gets it, NO ONE IS SPARED.  I can only imagine what an unrated director's cut would be like.  (HINT, HINT).  If you don't like vulgar or sick humor then stay away.  If you are a fan of "Orgazmo," or "South Park," sit down, relax and enjoy the show.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Paris was not only made for lovers!"></head><body><p>"You live into a bubble; don't know how the world is". These are the last words after an unpleasant discussion between this veteran of Intelligence service and his ex-wife about giving permission his daughter of just seventeen to make a travel for Paris.<br /><br />Written by Luc Besson and directed by a young director, Peter Morel, this thriller is told according the basic rules of this genre. It carves in relief the state of things in which the daughter of a divorced couple plans to make a trip to Paris in company of her friend Amanda (secretly they have decided to follow the musical schedule to U2), but his father who worked into the Intelligence Service is well aware about the dangerous situation.<br /><br />Liam Neeson (an actor of multiple artistic skills who should be more requested) makes a very credible performance acting like the avenger father who will travel to Paris breaking any kind of law to find her, because he just has 80 hours to avoid she was sent to other destinies.<br /><br />Full action, marvelous car chases, brutal violence and bloody scenes make this movie an admirable vehicle of entertainment.<br /><br />Somehow this movie made me remind that psycho thriller of the 80's Frantic directed by Polanski and acted by Harrison Ford, in which his wife is kidnapped, in Paris.</p></body></html>

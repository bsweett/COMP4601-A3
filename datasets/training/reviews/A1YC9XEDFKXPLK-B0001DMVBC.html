<meta name="summary" content="Lesson Learned ! Open Your Mail...."></head><body><p>House of Sand and Fog is one of those rare films to put the shock into anyone's system in recent years; It did me. I recently saw this film and many audience members gasped and were stunned by several emotionally charged pivotal scenes. House of Sand and Fog is full of suspenseful steam. Stunning performances by Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly and supporting cast are phenomenal. This is a highly charged film with enough seething psychological and emotional action ! Cinematography of panoramic proportions and filming techniques of the beautiful California coast and sky is simply breath taking but naturally overshadowed and marred by the devastatingly serious nature of the film.<p>In sum,a young California woman is incorrectly evicted from her home due to business property taxes processed which she did not owe. Failure on her part to open up the mail (notices/warnings) from the property county assessor's office lead to Connelly's character pursuing legal action but to no avail. House is auctioned and a Middle Eastern retired military officer (Ben Kingsley) and family purchase home for a 1/4 of what it is worth to live out the American dream.The house may be their permanent residency or it may become a "transitional" home. Soon, there is a tumultuous tug of war between evicted home owner and new occupants the likes that make the battle between the Hatfields and McCoys seem like a family reunion ! Events,  tempers, emotions flare to astronomical and disastrous horrific proportions pushing all parties concerned to the edge of madness and the point of no return. Just when there seems to be the least bit of glimmer of hope for compromise, well, you get the picture. The tumultuous battle begins to take its toll on both parties involved and the people around them...<p>Critics are right; there are no villains, heroes or heroines ...Just human beings trying to make sense of the madness that certain events life may throw at them while also trying to survive unscathed. It also raises a very powerful question ; How far is anyone willing to go to hang onto or protect what they believe or know is rightfully theirs (not just in the sense of owning a home but on anything in one's life, material or otherwise) ? Viewer sympathy will be split for both sides. <p>I have never read the book from which the film is adapted from, so I cannot critique as to how faithful the film is to the novel. Is this Oscar material (acting, best picture) ? Absolutley, no question about that. House of Sand and Fog will stay with you for some time to come and make you ponder and ask that raw question of "What would I do?"...</p></body></html>

When Aeon Flux was released I read reviews saying that if you've never seen the anime series that this is a hard movie not only to understand but also to sit through since you don't really know that much about it's past. This film feels like it's bringing closure to it's fans and all that says is that it's only for fans. Besides the fact that I attempted to watch this movie a little blind somehow it started to get a little boring and it wasn't because of the story. As much as I love Charlize she played this character too stiff. The rest of the cast was very weak especially Trevor (Marton Csokas) and I thought he would play the part pretty good.<br /><br />In the beginning they do their best to let newcomers know what's going on in the films past and present, they do a pretty good job informing and you're not all that in the dark. Aeon Flux's intelligence and cinematography actually start to exceed the actor's talents and it becomes a little hard for them to handle. The camera angles could have been a lot better, a lot of times your missing good fight scenes because the camera is somewhere else other than the action. Overall Aeon Flux could have been done better than this; it's missing a lot of key elements. The story is very appealing but this film missed the potential the live action movie should have. What really makes this movie a little good is the beautiful scenes of the future. The fight scenes were Ok but like I said earlier the camera angles killed them.</p></body></html>

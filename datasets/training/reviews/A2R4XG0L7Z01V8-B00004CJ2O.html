I've got many different reactions, one being that someone told me the bad luck was reversed. The most extreme reaction I've ever had was my history teacher at high school. I did really well in his class, he was a brilliant teacher, and he wanted me to continue taking history (we had to choose between history or geography) - until I told him I was born on Friday 13th. This is the guy who used to stay off school on Friday 13th. His phobia of anything Friday 13th was so severe that in quizzes, he used to miss out the number 13, and go straight from question 12, to question 14. Hello Mr Duncan.<br /><br />I've actually seen these films in the wrong order. I hadn't previously seen either the Friday 13th movies or the Nightmare On Elm Street movies when I saw the Freddy vs Jason movie. I know of both movies of course (and my boyfriend collects the dolls of Jason - sorry action figurines!) and he dressed up as Jason once for Halloween. But that was about it. I think I've seen Jason X, but it's a couple of years ago now.<br /><br />The first Friday 13th movie will not give you nightmares, or will make you hide behind the couch. I sat there waiting to be scared. I wasn't. My boyfriend did have nightmares that night, but I don't think it was caused by this somehow. It's very by-the-numbers horror. And it's so very eighties, it's embarrassing. But what I did like was the way you never actually saw Jason. You saw someone's feet or a hand holding a knife, but never the iconic figure. And then it seemed to be portraying Pamela Voorhees as the killer towards the end of the film - in my opinion anyway. He does appear right at the very end as a surprise for the audience, and certainly got a reaction then as you're not expecting it. Much like the finale of Freddy vs Jason I suppose.<br /><br />There's no big names in this film - or so I thought until I went on IMDB, and discovered that Kevin Bacon's lookalike in this was actually ... Kevin Bacon. Hehe. I sat throughout the film thinking "That guy really looks like Kevin Bacon", only to discover it actually was!<br /><br />There's no inventive killings in this, they come later in the franchise. I'm actually surprised the first movie spawned such a franchise, as to me, it wasn't that great. But then again, I am watching it the 21st century. I suppose it would have been scarier upon it's original release.<br /><br />Betsy Palmer is the actress who plays Pamela Voorhees and one critic was so angry at her role in the movie (which had angered many of her fans), that he published her address in his magazine, and encouraged people to write her and protest her. He published the wrong address.<br /><br />Friday 13th is an alright film, I wouldn't really call it a horror movie as such, maybe back in the day, but certainly not now. Hopefully the rest of the movies in the franchise is better.</p></body></html>

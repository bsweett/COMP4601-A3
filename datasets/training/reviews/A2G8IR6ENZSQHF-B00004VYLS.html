Above all, the film is just oozing with atmosphere, and &quot;Batman&quot;'s look is undoubtedly its #1 strength.  However, it also has some thrilling action sequences, a terrific villain (perhaps too good- see below), and, most importantly, a good man in the Batman suit.<p>The film belongs to Jack Nicholson- he is probably the real main character of this movie.  He makes the Joker both a funny and menacing character, and he gets all of the best lines.  This was a role Nicholson was born to play, and he enjoys it with relish.<p>Michael Keaton was the best Batman, in my opinion.  OK, so he is a little short, but no one else played the Bruce Wayne part better than he did.  He makes this a Batman to root for.  If only we saw more of him...<p>Which brings me to the film's main flaw- this is the Joker's film the entire way, not Batman's.  Why the filmakers decided to do this I don't completely understand, but it takes away something from the film.  We never really get to bond with the superhero in this one (this was somewhat remedied in &quot;Batman Returns&quot;).  Also, Kim Basinger's character is mainly eye candy and pales in comparison to future Batman girlfriends.<p>Nevertheless, I really do like this film, and I get caught up in its atmosphere every time I watch it- it still looks good 14 years later (although some of the Gotham backgrounds were obviously paintings).  This is largely thanks to director Tim Burton, who mostly understood how to handle Batman and his universe- he was the best man for this job.  He gets help from a great score by Danny Elfman and terrific designs by designer Anton Furst.<p>I would recommend this to all comic book fans, as it stands as an example of both a great comic book transition and of good filmaking in general.</p></body></html>

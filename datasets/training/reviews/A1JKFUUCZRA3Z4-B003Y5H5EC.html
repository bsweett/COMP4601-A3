There's lots of foreshadowing in the beginning of the movie that was fun to notice again -- the "missing child" poster at the cafe, the playful questioning each other if faces can lie, and the toast where they announce they're going to "take it all".<br /><br />There's definitely a creepiness factor in this movie.  The movie starts out with a close-up of a computer screen and you see two people sending very sexy instant messages to each other.  You get the feeling that one person is a young teenager while the other is a much older adult.  When the two decide to meet at a cafe, your worst fears are confirmed.  A 30 something male is meeting a 14 year old girl.  ICK.<br /><br />Ellen Page was perfectly cast for this role because she has such a baby face and small physique.  As an audience member, you feel protective of her as she flirts lolita-style with him at the cafe.  Other details that highlight how small she is add to the creepiness of what this man is doing -- like when he buys her a shirt in size small or when she puts on his very large jacket.<br /><br />There are two main themes I noticed in this movie.  One theme is innocence.  An obvious example is that she's young, but there's also the innocence of guilt.  Throughout the film, the man, no matter what he does, keeps insisting to himself that he is a decent, good man.  The story he tells in the kitchen also pulls at your heartstrings a bit.  This movie definitely messes with you!<br /><br />Another theme has to do with deception.  As mentioned before, there was the deception of faces lying, but there's also the deception of the internet.  When you go on the internet, you can transform into anyone you want to be...but how honest is that image?  Also revealed are the deceptive means pedophiles use to lure their victims as well as the deceptive means victims use to free themselves from their captors.<br /><br />I was impressed with the imagery in this film.  I just like little details here and there, like the way the window blinds moved, kind of like the shutter of a camera.  A real good scene was when he stabbed the photo of a young woman he photographed...but most telling was WHERE on the picture he stabbed her.<br />I also like the scene that's the first turning point in the film.  He's sitting on the couch, the scene goes a little blurry and you see something you're not quite sure if you saw right...and then the plot twist comes and you're taken on an edge-of-your-seat roller coaster ride.<br /><br />The audience will need to practice some suspension of disbelief to enjoy this movie and if they can do that, this movie won't disappoint.  The performances are fair on Ellen Page's part (she tends to overact in some parts) and excellent on the male lead's part.  I was extremely impressed with his performance.<br />Overall, loved this diabolical, clever and twistedly funny movie.</p></body></html>

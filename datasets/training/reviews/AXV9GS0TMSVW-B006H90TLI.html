<meta name="summary" content="Great Coen Brothers flick - but a bit too smart for its own good *possible spoilers*"></head><body><p>I watched No Country for Old Men in a theatre without about 5 other people in it.  Three people sitting behind me cussed the screen when the movie was over.  Part of me was saying they didn't get it.  Another part was saying they weren't supposed to.<br /><br />No Country for Old Men is a top notch suspense thriller by the Coen Brothers.  The characters and dialogue are carved so well that you can't help but get taken in.  But if you ask me what the film is about, I'll tell you it involves some deal gone wrong and a Texas man ends up running all over the state trying to keep the money while staying alive.  If you ask me what the film means, I might tell you to pick up the book.  It'll serve you better.<br /><br />As suspense thrillers go, this is great.  It's a chase around Texas.  If you're from Texas, you'll know they got it right.  The Coen's have these sparse locations where you'll feel just a tad afraid because of the isolation.  I particularly love the showdown between Josh Brolin and Javier Bardien in Eagle Pass.  It's shot at night and wondering when and where Bardien's terrifying Anton Sigur is going to strike simply leaves you on the edge.<br /><br />The talent involved is superb. Bardien deservedly got a lot of attention for his role as Anton Sigur, commanding attention anytime he's on screen.  He is easily the best villain I've seen in years.  Josh Brolin is something of an unsung hero though, easily slipping into the shoes of a man who knows he's gotten himself into deep as he's on the run through Texas.  Kelly MacDonald is almost recognizable as his wife.  I didn't know it was her until someone told me.  Then there's the infallible Tommy Lee Jones, not once sharing a scene with Brolin or Bardien, but nonetheless helps paint a picture of the horror going on around him as the officer who stumbles upon the case.  Jones' deliver is sharp, dry, and even has a bit of humor and, if you follow the film's themes, is really the heart of the story.<br /><br />The film deals with some rather challenging themes which the Coen Brothers paint quite well in some scenes, particularly when Bardien and Brolin's characters deal with more youthful characters in separate scenes.  The result is nothing short of poetic.  But this leads to the conclusion, which I will not spoil, but will say it involves analysys.  This is where I have take one star off of an otherwise perfect film.  The ending challenges us but also leaves us asking the question I posed earlier - what exactly does this film mean?  The ending functions better on paper.  It's smart, but a bit much for a movie that is filled with suspense and a good dose of action, almost playing down everything you just saw as rather trivial.  It's okay if you like it, but don't be ashamed if you don't like it or don't get it.</p></body></html>

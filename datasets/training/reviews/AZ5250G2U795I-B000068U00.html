<meta name="summary" content="A great film that stands the test of time"></head><body><p>I first saw Reservoir Dogs on video, and I remember very vividly that first experience of seeing such a fascinating story told in such an original way.  It would begin my love affair with anything Tarantino threw on screen, because it's so clear that this is a man who loves movies, and Reservoir Dogs was such a great way to begin his career with a bang.<br /><br />Reservoir Dogs is the story of a heist gone terribly awry.  It's discovered, through typical Tarantino flashback-style, that one of the members of the heist team is really an undercover agent, meant to disrupt it.  Problems result and one of the members of the team (Tim Roth) takes a vicious hit to the stomach as the heist ends in an unexpected shootout, and the other surviving members of the team are left in a warehouse fighting the clock to figure out who the 'rat' was, as well as what to do with their team member who is dying in front of them.<br /><br />Watchin these men turn on each other as they try to figure out who was the plant, how to save Roth, and how are they going to explain this to the boss makes for a story that has surprising depth and twists.  Tarrantino is a MASTER with dialogue, and this was the film that set his bar extremely high.<br /><br />The casting for this was impeccable as well.  Michael Madsen is flawless as Vic Vega, the hitman who takes pleasure in his dirty work,(I gaurantee you that you will never be able to listen to 'Stuck in the Middle with You' without cringing ever again) Steve Buchemi as the bit player hitman who wants a bigger part, and may just get it, in spite of himself, and Harvey Keitel as the one who takes Tim Roth's character under his wing to mentor him and must make hard and fast choices to keep him alive. (Keitel also was so impressed with Tarrantino's script that he was the driving force in getting the financing, and took a serious pay cut to have the film made)  Chris Penn also has a terrific turn as the thug-boss-son trying to run the show on his own and scrambing to figure out why everyting went so wrong.<br /><br />This film is absolutely amazing, and the DVD is by no means a wast of money.  Repeat viewings offer different insights into the story and help build on one's appreciation of it.  Also, the extras are really better than you would expect on a film this old.</p></body></html>

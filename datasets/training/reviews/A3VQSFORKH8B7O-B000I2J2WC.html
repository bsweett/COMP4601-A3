And to my surprise, I really enjoyed it. Although I disagree with the books ideas and opinions, it was still a very well-written thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat. But when I heard that the book was being made into a film, I was sceptical. Not because of the content, but that it would be hard to translate the book into a film.<br />Surprisingly, the film works. It's by no means a great film, but it is still pretty dang good. Where the film's drawback lies is in that it follows the book too closely.  But since the book is written in a way that not much can be changed, this weak-point can't be helped.<br />Tom Hanks and the cast do a great job of bringing the characters to life, while Ron Howard and the rest of crew do a commendable job behind the scenes. Kudos should especially go to Hans Zimmer, whose created a fantastic score, and the visual effects teams, who bring fantastical historical events and great imagery to the screen.<br />As for the film's message, it's presented as fiction. But it doesn't take either side. Langdon, who's character is slightly changed from the book, gives the movie's greatest line: "Is it possible that Jesus was a father, and still did all those miracles?" So, while it does question Jesus, it doesn't damn Him either.<br />Overall, "The Da Vinci Code" is a fine film adaptation of Dan Brown's novel. And, even though it is fiction, it is an opportunity to start a healthy debate on Who Jesus really was. May God bless you!<br />Movie Grade: B+</p></body></html>

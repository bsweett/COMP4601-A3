<meta name="summary" content="Really Good 'Menaced-In-The-Woods' Horror; Definately Recommended"></head><body><p>"Wrong Turn" is familiar but potent horror material, as a shortcut down a little-used back road strands two cars - one carrying a group, the other a lone passenger - deep in the woods and away from phone lines or normal human habitation, and, unknown to the travellers, in the territory of a long-isolated band of inbred mountain cannibals.  This kind of thing has been done a lot, and "Wrong Turn" doesn't re-invent the wheel, it just works that wheel better - much better compared to some of its peers  - than 90% of the similar horror movies before or since.  If you love the likes of the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" films (especially the early ones) or "The Hills Have Eyes" (original or remake, although the remake's my personal pick) you're going to enjoy "Wrong Turn"<br /><br />  It's not as extreme as most of the entries in the above-mentioned series, but it's not watered-down either; it's direct and violent at times, more focused on suspense at others, hitting a really good balance overall.  One of the reasons it's better than much of its kin is that the larger budget (small by today's theatrical release standards; huge compared to many of the more obscure direct-to-video entries in its vein) is that it's able to attempt - and fully pull off - things that many of its peers probably couldn't even try: the cannibal assault on the wooden lookout tower high above the forest, for example.  Well acted, great effects, great location for this kind of a movie in the vast, seemingly endless and seemingly so benign green forests; very taut and engaging.  No horror fan should miss this.</p></body></html>

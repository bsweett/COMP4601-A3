<meta name="summary" content="Brilliantly claustrophobic"></head><body><p>Although I must concede that I prefer the theatrical release to the Director's cut, this is still a very good movie that hasn't aged over time and remains as good as it ever was.<br /><br />Seven ordinary people, blue collar workers who happen to be in a spaceship, are travelling with their payload of mineral ore back to Earth. Dallas is the captain, Kane is second-in-command, Ripley is the warrant officer, Lambert is the navigator, Ash is the science officer, and Brett and Parker do the grunt work.  They are awakened 10 months early to investigate a distress signal on an uncharted planet.  However, only after Kane, Lambert, and Dallas go to the source of the signal does Ripley realize that it is in fact not an SOS at all, it's a warning.<br /><br />Kane returns with an alien life-form attached to his face, and soon a fully-grown, seven-foot tall Alien is stalking the crew-members and picking them off one at a time.<br /><br />Everything about this film is superlative: the subtle and moody score, the sets on the utilitarian Nostromo are effective and original, the direction is brilliant, the acting uniformly solid and the creature effects very good.  Equal accolades go to HR Giger for the creature effects and for Ridley Scott for keeping the creature hidden for most of the movie.<br /><br />See the original over the director's cut when possible, the new scenes are interesting to see once, but contradict elements of the alien life-cycle introduced in the sequal and make the fil less well-paced:<br /><br />Original Film: 9.5/10<br /><br />Director's Cut: 8.5/10</p></body></html>

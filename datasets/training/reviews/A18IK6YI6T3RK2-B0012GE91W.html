<meta name="summary" content="NOIR..BUT TRUE TO THE BOOK"></head><body><p>Unlike about every person in the world, I actually liked the book, but it was hella long and i wondered what was going to have to be sacrificed in order to make the movie..I was surprised at how little was left out, really im so sick of Quiddich, I didnt mind them nixing that.  I actually really liked this movie, eventhough I didnt like some of the new special effects, like the new dementors were not very good and the whole beginning felt very different from the book, that is not how i pictured the beginning at all, though the thestrials and the Ministry of Magic are amazing...I did like Stanton as Umbridge, she was an improvement on the annoying character in the book and the lead actors just get better and better..I've really gotten to like Gambon as Dumbledor and the scene when Voldemort battles Dumbledor is the best in the series thus far, it is spectacular.  This is a much darker film, but then again the book was dark, and Radcliffe is getting better as Harry, his acting is improving and his scenes with Gary Oldham are very good.  Overall, this is my favorite movie in the series thus far, it was the toughest book to make a movie out of so I commend the screenwriter and director for being true to the book and maybe even besting the book.  This same director is going to do the half blood prince, so im looking forward to seeing his take on that book, which is my favorite in the series.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

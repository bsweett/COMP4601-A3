<meta name="summary" content="Excellent, thought-provoking film."></head><body><p>I've read the other reviews here, however, I have not read the book. So I am writing this as my take on the movie.<br /><br />I felt it was excellent. The filming, special effects, acting and soundtrack all come together to present a superb mystery/though provoking movie.<br /><br />The premise of the film is simple. What if modern religion is/was a lie? What if Jesus WAS indeed a human? Would that not shake the very foundations that so many religions were forged upon? Indeed it would. Countless lives, battles, wars and crusades were carried out. More lives have been lost in the name of religion than for any other cause. Religions were the rock of governments for centuries even!<br /><br />If all of that came into question, it stands to follow that everything would then be questioned. Hence the premise for this film.<br /><br />In order to preserve societies and the world, as well as people's beliefs and lives even, a secret society was formed. To protect the world from the truth. So, if you can bring it into your mind that what we know today as religious history is a lie you can understand how unearthing the truth would shatter lives everywhere.<br /><br />The further mystery is... what exactly is the truth? And what do we do with it when we find it?<br /><br />All in all I would say that would be a most devastating blow to mankind. The way this movie plays it all out, with twists and turns, is done to perfection. It's part cat-and-mouse, part treasure hunt, part murder mystery and a big part of moral and ethical questioning.<br /><br />If you like a really good mystery that provokes much deeper and broader thinking, you will definitely like this movie. Nothing comes close in this realm. And, if you did like this movie you should read 'Another Roadside Attraction' and/or 'Skinny Legs and All', both by Tom Robbins.</p></body></html>

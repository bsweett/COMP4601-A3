<meta name="summary" content="TERRORISM STILL EXISTS"></head><body><p>It seems as though many people in the US have forgotten what happened on September 11th. Sure, the date remains fixed in our memories, but as the days progress beyond that point, we drift further and further away from the fact that an attack was launched on American soil that left 3000 dead. We feel complacent that another attack will never happen. It is such an attack that lies at the center of TRAITOR.<br /><br />The film begins with a slow buildup that delivers a final punch worthy of great thrillers. The action is used sparsely but the story is more full than most films of this sort. And the acting of Don Cheadle shows just how good he truly is.<br /><br />Cheadle stars as Samir Horn, born in the Sudan but now a US citizen. Having served in Afghanistan during the first initiative there, he made the decision to stay and to look deeper into the religion of his youth. This led to his becoming and explosives expert as well as an arms dealer.<br /><br />Involved in a major deal, he is captured along with the group's ringleader, Omar (Said Taghmaoui). During their confinement to the typical movie style Middle Eastern prison, Omar begins to see that Samir is not your typical mercenary. Samir believes in the Koran and its teaching as witnessed in his defense of a poor prisoner by the jail yard bully.<br /><br />The two become close and when the time comes for Omar to escape, he takes Samir along with him. Using his knowledge, expertise and ability to get the explosives needed for a major project they have planned, Samir becomes part of the group.<br /><br />Running concurrently with this story is that of FBI agent Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce). Straight laced all the way, Clayton has been trying to stop terrorists abroad when his path crosses that of Samir. That ended when Samir went to prison. It begins anew after an explosion in Spain where Samir was sighted.<br /><br />The film deals with the life of a terrorist as he plots out the next major attack. It also runs into the spy thriller mode when it shows that this group has infiltrated the US with spy cells just waiting for the command to do damage.<br /><br />A major twist in the story presents itself late into the film that turns the whole story around. If you paid attention while watching the preview for the film you guessed it already. *SPOILER*  It turns out that Samir is actually working for the US government in the form of official Jeff Daniels, the only person to know this fact.<br /><br />The twists add to the story as Samir is conflicted in what to do. He lives to serve God and country and yet feels that to serving his country he has abandoned God. Driven to desperate acts to protect us from the terrorists, Samir does things against the teachings of God. Keep in mind we're not talking Christian/Judeo God, we're talking God from the Koran.<br /><br />And that's what makes this film good on another level. It looks at the beliefs of the Koran and how the terrorists use that belief to foment the youths that they gather to die. At the same time, the sentiments of the Koran for peace are discussed.<br /><br />The main plan that the terrorists have concocted is one that could happen. It involves numerous explosions all over the country at once. And the chances of Samir to stop it grow slimmer with each moment as he attempts to cover both ends of the spectrum on this plot.<br /><br />Cheadle is fantastic, showing the acting skills needed to make this believable and not just making Samir another James Bond suave, sophisticate attempting to blend in. No, in Cheadle's performance we see a man conflicted who believes strongly in his religion but who knows that evil is not defeated easily.<br /><br />Guy Pearce does his usual stand up job as the more by the book agent trying to protect his country at all costs. The rest of the casts do a great job as well with Neal McDonough as Pearce's more violent prone partner and Alyy Kahn as the nefarious leader of the terrorists group.<br /><br />Thrillers today seem more intent on gadgets and tricks than on the gut level approach to real problems in today's world. Make no mistake, the ideas seen here seem more real than most. And those who would do this country harm remain out there. While this movie might offer entertainment, action, adventure and a great performance, it is also a sobering reminder of where we are at today. And perhaps that's a good reminder to have.</p></body></html>

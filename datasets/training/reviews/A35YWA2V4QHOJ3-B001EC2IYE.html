<meta name="summary" content="Million Dollar Hilary!"></head><body><p>While I'm not into women's boxing, per-se, this was nonetheless quite a powerful movie.  The plot has an unexpected twist in it, and I would admonish people who view this movie NOT to find out what the twist is before watching it.<br /><br />I swear, you could dress Clint Eastwood up in a pink dress, put little girly hairpins in his hair and he would STILL be more macho than the lot of we men.  In this film, he portrays a past-his-prime boxing trainer who is without any top-notch contenders to teach.<br /><br />Hilary Swank is a girl who shows up @ the gym some day, pays her dues and wants to get a trainer.  Eastwood's character is reluctant to be her manager as he's never dealt with women boxers below.  However, in the end her charm wins him over.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is great as an over-the-hill boxer who had a very bad experience in his final bout.  His character is kind of the "stabilizing force" of the movie.<br /><br />Hilary is toned & buff for the film.  She looks sexy even with a broken nose and blood all over her face.  On top of that, she's an accomplished actress.  This will be one of the most memorable roles in this timespan of her career, although I have a feeling she will still be active as an actress in her 50's & 60's.<br /><br />This is a sports movie, but it is a very atypical one.  It is as much about Hilary's character as it is about her boxing prowess.  Hilary portrays a girl trying to break away from poverty, and the thing she is best at is boxing.  There is perhaps more character development in this film than any other movie I know of.  That's always a plus for a sports film!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cheap and cheerful thriller"></head><body><p>I initially bought this because I thought Rachel McAdams was brilliant in Mean Girls and The Notebook, and I read on IMDB, that she's got the lead role in The Time Traveller's Wife (a book which I'm currently re-reading) opposite Eric Bana. Love the book, love her. Saw this for dead cheap, and although it sounds like a standard thriller movie, I thought I'll have that.<br /><br />The thing about Rachel McAdams is she never plays the same character twice, unlike so many of her peers. Plus, her look changes with every film, and I barely recognised her, with the reddish brown hair.<br /><br />Starring opposite Cillian Murphy, a truly creepy guy (I think it's the eyes), the two stars bounce well off each other, when they're the ones really holding the film up, as it's mostly about them. Rachel is playing a hotel manager, who is travelling back from a funeral. She's smart, she's tough, and she takes no nonsense. Cillian plays the appropriately named Jackson Rippner, a nice guy with a dark side. He befriends Rachel's character, buys a drink, and then reveals his Ace on the plane - he wants an important VIP, currently staying at her hotel, moved rooms, so he can be killed. And he also knows her father. And there's someone waiting outside his house, to kill him, if Jackson doesn't phone them at such and such a time.<br /><br />The third act is where it really lets the film down, when Wes Craven turns it into a Scream-chase-the-pretty-girl-around-the-house standard movie. It falls flat on its face here, but not so bad to ruin the rest of the movie.<br /><br />It's a truly claustrophobic movie, which is probably why I love these kind of movies. Makes me never want to set foot on a plane ever again. I'm glad I never travel alone either, because I can barely handle being in a pub (I always swap a ring onto my engagement finger), it's the whole thing that I can't handle being approached by someone in that kind of situation. The way Jackson approaches Rachel's character is just way too creepy for my liking. It's definitely worthwhile seeing. Plus the guys won't grumble too much at Rachel McAdams. I can't wait to see her in The Time Traveller's Wife.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Oscar Time...?"></head><body><p>The Oscars are on Sunday, and "The Hurt Locker" seems to be the front runner. I'm not sure about that, but if it wins, I wouldn't complain. Katherine Bigelow's anti-war Iraq epic is loaded with suspense, fine acting, editing, script,  cinematography and all the stuff that makes an Oscar winner. It's never boring, and the characters each have an agenda. Interesting. Also interesting is that it made the rounds of indie film festivals in 2008. The 2008 Indie Spirits nominated it for 2 awards: Jeremy Renner as Best Actor, and Anthony Mackie as Best Supp Actor. No mention of Ms. Bigelow, or Best Picture. I'm going out on a limb here, but I think Ms Bigelow will win the Oscar for Director, but her ex-husband's film will win Best Picture (Avatar). The DVD has lots of extras, and Ms Bigelow has a tremendous amount of personal "touch" that I think is solely responsible for its power. Jeremy Renner is certainly capable, but it's Jeff Bridges' turn to win...and, in this case, it's not just Oscar politics. Enuff...only my opinion.  UPDATE: I think the Oscars got it right. Maybe there should be a new category of Best CGI film. I DO enjoy when small Indie films beat out the studio big-shots.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Romantic Suspense"></head><body><p>Hitchcock liked working with Cary Grant and James Stewart. Any of his movies that have either of these stars were exceptional and could be viewed by the whole family. These movies always dealt more with suspense than showing blood and gore. North By Northwest is one of the most suspenseful of his movies and it has a good romance story to boot. Cary Grant is magnificent playing the innocent bystander caught up in a grand scheme of espionage.<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint is wonderful as the romantic interest that is a unknown factor. Is she a spy for the bad guys or is she on the side of justice? This movie also contained some wonderful scenery and sets. The Biplane and Mt. Rushmore scenes have some of his greatest camera work ever. The angles used are extremely effective in making you feel you are there. Bernard Herrman's beautiful haunting music adds to the suspense and helps to make this movie a classic Hitchcock.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A few brief thoughts..."></head><body><p>I don't have much to say here so I'm going to try something new.  I'm going to use a single sentence to convey my thoughts on each facet of this film.<br /><br />The Script:<br />A confused history lesson delves into campy soap operatic tones that snuff out the more interesting bits.<br /><br />The Direction:<br />A total step backward from its grittier 1998 predecessor, Kapur tries to add too much gloss and loses his core along the way.<br /><br />The Acting:<br />Clive Owen is a joke, Abbie Cornish can't act, Cate Blanchett is shocking bland and unfocused and Samantha Morton steals the whole show with a handful of scenes (she's amazing).<br /><br />The Technical:<br />Some overblown visuals look cheesy and fake, but the costumes are divine and the texture of the set pieces are organic and splendid to look at.<br /><br />In the end I hope that they stop here.  I loved the 1998 film, and Blanchett in it, but this was a disaster that failed on nearly every level, the Oscar winning costumes aside.</p></body></html>

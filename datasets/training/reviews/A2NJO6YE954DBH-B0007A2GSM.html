<meta name="summary" content="The Incredibles not only have the name, they have the game"></head><body><p>Comic book superheroes are basically vigilantes who usually operate outside the law, although certainly many of them have associations with law enforcement authorities (e.g., Batman the Batsignal, Hellboy and the F.B.I.).  Some of the best comic book stories of recent years, such as Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns" and Alan Moore & Dave Gibbons' "Watchmen," have explored the idea of what happens when society decides to get rid of its superheroes.  Actually, they have dealt with what happens when the banned superheroes come back, which is the subject of Pixar's latest triumph, "The Incredibles."  The difference, of course, is that whereas "The Dark Knight Returns" is tragedy, "The Incredibles" is more of a farce.  Besides, whereas Batman has pseudo-familial relationships with Alfred and the latest Robin, the Incredibles are a two-generation family of superheroes.<br /><br />We begin before the end for the superheroes of this world as once again they are called upon to save the day.  But this is a world where no good deed goes unpunished because there is always a lawyer around to make sure of that.  The next thing we know, we have jumped ahead to a world without superheroes, or, more specifically, a world in which superheroes are trying to live ordinary lives.  But Bob Parr a.k.a. Mr. Incredible (voice of Craig T. Nelson) is having a hard time because there are just so many good deeds out there begging to be done and people to be rescued from burning buildings.  Meanwhile, his wife Helen a.k.a. Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) is trying to lead a normal life raising their three paranormal children, Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox), and baby Jack Jack (Elie Fucile & Maeve Andrews).<br /><br />On "Bowling night" Bob and his best friend Lucius Best a.k.a. Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) sit around and talk about the good old days, and sometimes engage in a little undercover superhero work.  This has not gone unnoticed and when Bob learns that there may be a place for Mr. Incredible in the new world order, complete with a new costume courtesy of Edna 'E' Mode, he is more than willing.  Now, all he has to do is hide his new "job" from his suspicious wife.  Meanwhile, just because the superheroes have all been retired does not mean that the villains are playing by the same rules.  As Mr. Incredible points out at the start of the film, "No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again."<br /><br />The superpowers of the characters in "The Incredibles" are pretty basic.  Mr. Incredible is basically Superman stripped down to strength and invulnerability (or Wonder Man if you read Marvel instead of DC), Elastigirl is a female version of Plastic Man/Mr. Fantastic, Violet has both of the Invisible Girl's powers (i.e., Invisible Kid + Kid Psycho), Dash is super fast like the Flash/Quicksilver, and Frozon is Ice Man without turning into a walking icicle.  As for Jack Jack, let us just say that the final report on the tyke is not in yet (i.e., Franklin Richards squared).<br /><br />Director Brad Bird has parlayed his traditional animation efforts "Family Dog" and "The Iron Giant" into this computer animated Pixar film.  "The Incredibles" avoids the question of where did the first generation of superheroes come from, so there is no concern with visitors from a strange planet or bites from radioactive spiders, and few will ponder the reproductive niceties of Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl reproducing (remembering the "Elsewhere" story where Lois Lane died when the superbaby started kicking will help sober you up).  Bird keeps the rules simple, you accept the premise, and go along for the ride.<br /><br />The key thing about this ride is that it is both fast paced and creative.  My favorite sequence is when the family is in danger and Violet needs to step up to the plate and use her powers or else they are all going to be dead.  You know what is supposed to happen at this point, but it does not happen, and if you do not end up thinking that Elastigirl is the most competent superhero in this film then you are just not paying attention.  I also liked the discussion on villains "monologuing" (remember the "SNL" panel discussion involving James Bond villains?) and the jump cut on the car toss scene at the end was very cool as well.  "The Incredibles" is, of course, a comedy, but it takes itself seriously, which is why it ended up being rated PG and why this one is a keeper for comic book fans of all ages.</p></body></html>

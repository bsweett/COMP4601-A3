<meta name="summary" content="One of Pierce Brosnan's Best Films Yet"></head><body><p>Funny, engaging comedy that grabs you from the get go! For once Brosnan doesn't play a suave, drop dead gorgeous ladies man. Instead we see Brosnan play a successful, middle aged, psychopathic hitman with no home life, family, or friends to speak of! His career is all he has and he goes from country to country living from hotel to hotel assassinating those his employer wants him to eliminate.<br /><br />Near the start of this movie, we find both Brosnan's character  and Greg Kinnear's character in Mexico City, Mexico on business. Kinnear plays the role of a mild manner/straight-laced business/family man. Both men are going through a mid-life crisis of sorts as Kinnear's character is on a new business venture and Brosnan's character begins to realize that he is a VERY LONELY middle-aged man with no place to call home.<br /><br />The two begin to form a unique friendship during their time in Mexico City. Brosnan's character later reveals to Kinnear's character that he is an assasin, which Kinnear's character doesn't believe. By the end of their stay in Mexico City, the two are no longer speaking to each other as Brosnan's character has no social skills to maintain a friendship.<br /><br />In the end, Brosnan's character shows up at Kinnear's home in Denver in need of help! He has been failing at his job miserably and is about to be assassinated by his employer for failing to do his job. So, Kinnear comes to the rescue and helps his friend out. I don't want to spoil the ending, so your on you own! Highly recommend this witty movie that holds you attention from start to finish!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Strangely sterile, a troubling nightmare of forsaken femininity."></head><body><p>This is a movie that got universally bad reviews.  It helped knowing that going in because my expectations were very low.  Being a fan of Angelina Jolie, I was not disappointed in her performance.  Despite a thin plot and cheesy effects, Angelina delivered her lines with class and finesse.  Unfortunately even her talent cannot overide an overall lack of plot and unbelievable situations.  The film grew tiresome very quickly.<br /><br />On a Jungian level this film portrays a strange sterility.  The first scene is Lara upside down, in the middle of a training exercise set by her computer nerd flunkie and her all-purpose butler.  This opening segment defined the problem for the film--someone who is not grounded and unconscious.  Lara raids tombs and fights bad guys to no real purpose--except perhaps to pit her skills against someone else.  This cycle repeats endlessly, as do video games, which create a feeling of accomplishment where there is none, sterile endeavors with no learning and no personal or interpersonal gain.  The individual does not develop--just the skills.  Lara steals the ancient wealth of civilizations from tombs, co-opting heritage and treasure for the love of the game.  This disregard for cultural artifacts except as an exercise is indicative of lack of depth and insight.<br /><br />In one moment in the movie, there is a clear symbol of the futility of this lifestyle--Lara puts everything aside to retrieve a memento of her dead father.  But then she reverts to form.  In addition there is no mention of her mother--what happened to her and why is this not a loss? Obviously this is such a deficit it cannot be referred to except obliquely by one scene where an enormous statue of a woman is destroyed, and by the total lack of other women in the film.<br /><br />Overall a troubling nightmare of forsaken femininity.</p></body></html>

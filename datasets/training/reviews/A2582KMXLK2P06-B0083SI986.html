<meta name="summary" content="gran?  how about grand!"></head><body><p>Well, after all the hype, I can say with complete honesty- this movie moved me in the way I was hoping it would.<br /><br />For the last several months I've been trying to find a way to watch Gran Torino.  All year long it was like the number one movie on my mind that I felt I simply HAD to watch.<br /><br />All the awards the film won, all the frequent mentions of Clint Eastwood blowing us away with his performance, and...<br /><br />the film was actually as good as most people said it would be.  This doesn't happen very often!<br /><br />I was seriously moved by the engaging storyline from beginning to end.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood playing the role of a stubborn old man that none of his family seems to care about and becoming bitter and angry at the world as a result was delivered *flawlessly*<br /><br />I'm a bit surprised the storyline focused so much on Clint's character building a relationship between his neighbors and himself, and less on the part about trying to protect his home from the never-ending gang fights taking place outside.<br /><br />The actual gang fights were about 50% of the film, while the other half dealt with Clint and the young boy from next store getting to know each other better and building a friendship through patience, hard work and a willingness for Clint to finally open up and accept his neighbors.<br /><br />This is truly a great movie with an ending that might move you in a way you've never felt before.  It's a bit of a shocking ending to me, but I guess the more I think about it while typing up this review, it's the kind of ending to be expected.<br /><br />I can't think of another way to make the outcome more realistic, while also keeping in mind that the intention of the writers while putting together this film was to make an impact on the viewers, let's put it that way.<br /><br />There's a couple hidden messages behind the storyline as well- always accept others, don't be so quick to judge, and never follow through with your initial reactions.  There's also a message that you can in fact change people who are always in trouble with the law.<br /><br />Overall, yeah, this movie is simply terrific the entire way through.  A brilliant job by everyone involved.</p></body></html>

At first, the film seems to come off as just a blur of swordfights and tentacled menaces, but it's more than that.  The tale begins with Liz Swann preparing to marry her love, Will Turner.  Of course, the East India company decides to arrest both of them for aiding Captain Jack Sparrow.  They have to bargain to save their own necks.  Mentioning Sparrow, he and the crew of the Black Pearl are after a key.  What's the purpose of this key?  It's the key (pun not intended) to breaking a pact between Sparrow and one Davy Jones (of the Locker fame) whom Sparrow owes something very valuable.  I won't go into particulars for the simple fact that this will ruin parts of the film for newcomers.  Meanwhile we are introduced to a horde of cannibals, voodoo queens, the Flying Dutchman, and a slew of new and old characters that truck the story along at a very, very brisk pace.<br /><br />At almost two-and-one-half hours, you'd expect to tire after awhile, but that's not the case.  All of the swashbuckling adventure is bridged at perfect distances by a swift-moving plotline that isn't boring and leaves the viewer hanging on for the third film which is to come out next year.<br /><br />The special effects are wonderful and do not get in the way of the film.  By now I'm sure that most folks have heard about the Kracken, but this isn't the Kracken of "Clash of the Titans" as envisioned by the master of stop-motion animation, Ray Harryhausen.  Instead, it's a very large, very tentacled sea monster who sinks any ship to the depths at the command of Davy Jones.  Jones' primarily CGI'd crew are all pieced out wonderfully, especially the hammerhead pirate.  Jones is also a wonderful creature to see on the screen.  He's part squid, part lobster, and maybe even a little jellyfish, and definitely has a nasty attitude about him.<br /><br />Johnny Depp, Keira Knightly, Orlando Bloom, Jack Davenport, and a host of other actors from the original film reprise their roles.  All of them do a wonderful job on the screen.<br /><br />In closing, I've noticed that a number of reviewers have compared this flick to "Empire Strikes Back" as being a bridging film.  In my book, that's quite an honor considering that "Empire Strikes Back" is one of the most loved films in the original "Star Wars" trilogy.  Sure, the ending may not be what you expect or hope for, but it baits you for what will probably be a stunning conclusion to a story that started out as a theme park ride and has grown into its own thanks to a wonderful story, dashing heroes and heroes, wicked villains, and a colorful captain that everyone knows by now, that being, of course, Captain Jack Sparrow.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="America Needed A Hero"></head><body><p>I must admit that I viewed this film with some trepidation. I had seemed to me that I had seen this film before. America struggling through the Great Depression needs a hero to lift its spirits and get it on the road to recovery. Two years ago a film called Seabiscuit was supposed to have done this. This year we find out that the real hero of the people is a down on his luck boxer named Jimmy Braddock. Thirty years ago it was a down on his luck boxer named Rocky.<br /><br />I guess part of me balked at the idea that the promotional campaign for this film promised your money back if you didn't enjoy the film. That scares me a little. The film is watchable and has some great performances even though it is not anything special. Kudos do need to be given to Paul Giamatti in one of the best roles of his career. It is a real shame that he did not pick up the Oscar for his performance. Ron Howard's direction is up to his usual standards it's just that this is not one of his best films. The screenplay by Akiva Goldsman is well written but also nothing fantastic (even though more deserving  of praise than A Beautiful Mind).<br /><br />On the whole this is a good film  well worth a watch, it just didn't strike me as wonderful. Apparently many fans felt the same way looking at its poor box office showing. The DVD comes packed with three commentaries by Howard, Goldsman ,and story developer Cliff Hollingsworth and several promotional featurettes. A gripe I had with this package is that one had to flip the disc to get to the additional bonus features. In this day and age two discs would have been easier.<br /><br />Worth a look but you may have a slight feeling of deja vu.</p></body></html>

I was wrong. This movie is absolutely terrible. The basic premise is that Tripp (McConaughey) is a 35-year-old guy who still lives at home, and his desperate parents hire Paula (Parker), a professional interventionist whose job is to get Tripp to move out of the house. Things don't exactly go as planned, and Paula ends up falling for Tripp, who eventually finds out what his parents and girlfriend are up too, blah blah blah.<br /><br />This film tries so hard to be funny, but it's just not. There is absolutely no chemistry between McConaughey and Parker, the story is ridiculous, and there are a bunch of weird, random things in this movie that are completely unnecessary and add nothing of value to the film (examples: Paula's exceptionally strange roommate, people constantly being attacked by wild animals, and seeing Terry Bradshaw's naked arse for about ten excruciatingly long minutes).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and skip this movie, or you'll end up wasting almost two hours of your precious life.</p></body></html>

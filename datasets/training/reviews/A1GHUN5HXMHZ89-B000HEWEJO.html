<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful Life Lesson"></head><body><p>Even though some years it is overly shown on TV I still love this movie and never tire of it. I think what makes it one of my favorites is that it tells much more than a Christmas story. It tells us that no matter what we do, we matter. We touch so many peoples lifes during our lifetime that like a butterfly flitting across a blue sky in Illinois may lead to the wind a Sailing ship needs in the Sea of Japan. Well a little overstated maybe but we do in fact cause ripples in the fabric of our civilization. We all may never impact so many as George Bailey does, but we certainly can make a difference even if it is just one we touch. Anyone no matter what age should enjoy this movie.</p></body></html>

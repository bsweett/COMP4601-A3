Hillary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood put in epic performances.  No phoniness here as it certainly takes a lot of time for Swank's character to get through to crusty old Mr. Eastwood's character.  The side stories involving Morgan Freeman and the semi-retarded fighter is quite intriguing as well.  Nonetheless, Eastwood at this late stage in his career still has a strong will.  Good stuff indeed.</p></body></html>

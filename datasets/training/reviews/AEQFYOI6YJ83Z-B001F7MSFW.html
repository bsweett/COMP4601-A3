Or watch "Hellboy II: The Golden Army."  At first, it's a horrible title--kinda cheesy.  But after watching the movie, you get it: This is a fairy tale, more Grimm than Anderson, with a hero who is destined to bring about the destruction of mankind.  Sounds like a real trooper.<br /><br />In "Golden Army," Red and his comrades must face a...well...a golden army.  Actually, they must first try and stop Prince Nuada, an elf warrior who is tired of mankind ignoring and spitting on his people.  He aims to raise the Golden Army from their ancient slumber, and set them loose upon the world.  And only a hellspawn (that would be our White Knight) can stop him.  There's just one catch: Prince Nuada is more than a match for humankind, and may even be more powerful than our beloved hero.<br /><br />"Golden Army" is a visual delight: I don't even want to term the images we see as "special effects;" they are simply more realistic, more vital, than that limited term implies.  The first "Hellboy" was an impressive little action diddy, but little more; "Golden Army" is a tour-de-force, a treat to the senses.  The effects (I guess I have to use the word, after all) are stunning.  The dialogue is quick and furious; this movie is almost as funny as it is impressive.  The acting is superb; Ron Perlman, as always, manages to charm (and, let's face it, make us just a tad bit uneasy).  His rapport with teammates Selma Blair and Doug Jones (who plays multiple roles, as he did in "Pan's Labyrinth") is genuine and engaging.  Luke Goss, as the evil Prince Nuada, is a scene-stealer, a thoroughly menacing character; Goss manages, even, to bring a bit of nuance to the Prince, making him for of a tragic figure (as fits the fairy tale backdrop).  Seth MacFarlane (yes, the "Family Guy" Seth MacFarlane) brings a bit of sly grace to the character of Johann Krauss, bringing what could have been a cliched character his own little personality.<br /><br />And, see, that's the thing about "Hellboy II": nothing here is cliched.  It could have been; but it isn't.  Because this movie is a fairy tale: one gigantic, action-packed fairy tale, albeit one where the lines between good and evil aren't quite so discernable, and our hero is destined to be our destroyer.  But that's del Torro for you: He never plays completely by the rules; he always manages to bend them to his will.  "Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is simply a stunner, and much more than a comic book movie, or even a sequel.  This is a movie to delight and entertain...but also, perhaps, to make us think about ourselves and the world around us.  It's a secondary goal, to be sure, but it's there...it's there...somewhere behind the bone-eating tooth fairies and the cat-eating trolls.</p></body></html>

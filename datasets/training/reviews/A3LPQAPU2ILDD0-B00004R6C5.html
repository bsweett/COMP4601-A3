<meta name="summary" content="A True American Classic"></head><body><p>Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch is one of those great film performances that one can never get enough of. A film that never get's old, because it tells of a time when America was at its crossroads. This film brings memories of continuous viewing whenever shown on TV. Brock Peters play's the black defendant, falsely accused of raping a white woman. The atmosphere gives a real feel of southern Americana at its worst. A time of dispare for blacks, as evidenced by the jury of his all white "peers." But along with the bad, were the extremely good individuals like Atticus and his family, that stood-up for justice and equality for all. Some of the best child actors ever seen on screen as well. And what has to be the best portrayal of a single father to date. One of the all-time best films on any list. See if you can spot Robert Duvall in his film debut.</p></body></html>

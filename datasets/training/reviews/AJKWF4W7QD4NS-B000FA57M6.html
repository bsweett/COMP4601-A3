<meta name="summary" content="Bad, real bad"></head><body><p>You want to see bad?  I mean real bad?  Then you've got to see Doom, the long awaited adaptation of the wildly popular early 90's PC shooter is here, and not only is it about ten years late, it's absolutely abysmal.  Karl Urban and the Rock star as good and evil space marines sent to investigate strange happenings on moons of Mars, and while fans of the classic game will no doubt see where the story should lead, it doesn't.  Yes, there's no mention of Hell.  Yes, the CGI demons are lame.  Yes, the acting is terrible.  Yes, the storyline itself is about as boring, cliche ridden, and predictable as can be with little sense to anything at all.  Not to mention the fact that when Doom switches to it's first person-esque view towards the climax, that's when the film goes into complete and utter cheese territory.  Die Another Day's Rosamund Pike is also here, for no apparent reason.  All in all, Doom is a brainless waste of film that's so bad that you would expect Uwe Boll's name to be attached to it, and it should be avoided by longtime fans of the game and everyone else as well.</p></body></html>

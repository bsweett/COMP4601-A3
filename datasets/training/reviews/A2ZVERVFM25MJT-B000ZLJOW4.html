I had absolutely no idea what the movie was about, apart from that it was a comedy, so what I got was a pleasant surprise when much of the comedy here is not only biting but tinged with loneliness and despair.  The film follows two girls, Enid (Birch) and her best friend Scarlett Johannson, as they graduate from high school and slum it through the summer vacation.  Playing pranks on the boring people of the Nowheresville where they live Enid suddenly finds herself attracted to an older man (Buscemi) who collects records obsessively.  Gradually she finds herself leaving her best friend behind for this older man and discovering that slumming it isn't a possibility for the rest of your life.<p>It's difficult to sum up exactly what the movie is about other than to say that it's basically about life, love, hope, despair and tragedy.  However, the caustic comedy lends this an edge that few other films have, not to mention a sometimes overwhelming honesty that is often incredibly moving.  Despite being billed as a comedy (and, indeed, it is very funny at times - in particular in its comments about modern art) this is really more of a drama with comedy in it.  The performances are all top notch, and Thora Birch really sets herself up as the next big thing with a beautifully understated performance that is well matched by the likes of Johannson, Buscemi and the fantastic Illeana Douglas, in a small but instantly recognisable role.<p>The thing with this kind of movie is that it's intelligent, and certainly doesn't belong to the 'American Pie' ilk of teen movies, but in fact is a much more mature little flick that is destined to become a cult classic given enough time.  Sure there are parts of it that are slow, but the emotional weight of the movie is undeniably, with an ending that is either hopeful or tragic given your point of view.  It only really hits you a few days later how good this film really is, and speaking as someone who watched it during the summer vacation before I went to university, it sums up perfectly the fears, dreams and hopes that becoming an adult entails.</p></body></html>

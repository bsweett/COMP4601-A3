<meta name="summary" content="Only One Problem"></head><body><p>First I'm just reviewing this movie and I have never read the Bourne Novels nor have I seen the old Miniseries from 1988 so I am comparing this movie to nothing. My one and only problem with this film is the leading female actress Franka Potente (Marie), I don't know if it was her character that was annoying or just her in general. She was constantly in the way and almost making you want something to happen to her character.<br /><br />It almost seems like the producers thought if they put a girl who isn't all that cute and has mediocre acting skills then there's no way she could out shine Matt Damon and boy did it work. For a minute you start to think Matt is playing his role a bit weak but then you realize he's good at playing a man who has lost his memory. The fight sequences are fantastic and this is where you start to give a little respect because all the fights are perfect but I think they could of used a little bit more of them, maybe two or three.<br /><br />The plot kind of reminds you of the Replacement Killers when Chow Yun-Fat wasn't able to assassinate the cop because the guys son was right there with him when he tried to do it but Chow wasn't trained by the government and definitely not as dangerous or exciting. If your watching this thinking it's a movie where you start to feel for the characters then don't bother with it, Bourne didn't even show too much feelings for his new love Marie. This is a plain old action flick with a nice and interesting story. Overall this is a movie that will have you loving it for the action and the crazy car chase in the Mini Cooper but I really think another leading actress was needed.</p></body></html>

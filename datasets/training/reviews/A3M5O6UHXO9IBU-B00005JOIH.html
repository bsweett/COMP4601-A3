Professional pride was at stake after the angst ridden, Keystone Cops portrayal given here. Not saying Mossad's rebuttal should be taken as gospel and Spielberg 'trusts his sources' apparently. However, I'm not convinced by his film.<br /><br />In the documentary, the elevator assassins ask their target for his name and shoot him quickly using silencers. In 'Munich', they come across as bumbling amateurs. Another agent shows up after they've departed to look for shell casings, inexplicably exposing himself to possible arrest through his enigmatically slow lingering. But hey, doesn't enigmatically slow lingering look cinematic? The team doesn't hire an explosives expert, that would be too vulgar a display of professional competence. They take his word for it instead. No checking of backgrounds in Mossad it appears. This elite team will foolishly run back into a building to salvage a botched job rather than walk away. Curiously, the writer chooses to ignores facts about the Beruit raid concerning the loss of the element of surprise. Instead, he prefers to make up no end of far fetched mistakes.<br /><br />'Munich' smacks of a writer constantly puting his own sentiments into the mouths of people least likely to have expressed such reservations. The most a real life Mossad assassin would admit to in the documentary is deliberatly avoiding sentimentality by not seeing his gun-downed target as a family man. Instead, he concentrated on his orders and trusted his bosses judgement implicitly. In a scene of stunning crassness in 'Munich', the paranoid lead agent strips his room looking for Israeli type assassination tactics and then goes to hide in his closet just as he had been told his enemy had been driven to. But why does he think tactics unique to Israeli intelligence would be used against him? Do I smell agenda? But to make sure we really get it, team Spielberg has the agent look like an x-ray during debriefing back in Israel. He's a ghost, get it. Haunting himself because of what the state has made him do. No wonder the real life Israeli intelligence community is feeling more than a little miffed.<br /><br />The Americans don't come out of the picture smelling of roses either, surprise, surprise. In the documentary I saw, the CIA opperative who handled a key PLO leader Mossad wanted to assassinate over Munich at least expressed sentiments sympathetic to the Israeli position. In the film, the CIA are portrayed as positely anti-Semitic, giving the Mossad team the proverbial one fingered salute.<br /><br />I noticed that the writer had the Munich atheletes fight back against the terrorists, one even bravely climbing back into the window to tackle the bad guys single handedly with a knife versus assault rifles. Wishful thinking as an answer to events in World War Two? Or is the writer suggesting that the individual is entitled to fight back, but state sponsored assassination is a no-no? The message I took from the final scene was that Israel is a false construct that will turn Jew against Jew, a scurrilous piece of anti-Zionist muck raking that no doubt will find its constituency.<br /><br />Why not keep to the facts? The real life botched killing of an innocent man that ended with the incarceration of a Mossad hit squad should have said plenty about the evils of violating international law. Instead we are offered indigestible hand ringing platitudes unconvincingly delivered by all and sundry.<br /><br />Technically, I wish Spielberg would dump this cinematographer he seems to be using of late. Gloomy bluey grey washed out vistas with ghosting, especially against light sources. Enough.<br /><br />Sorry, Steve. I went to bat for you over War of the Worlds, but I can't defend this clunker. Even Oliver Stone might blanche at this revionist claptrap.</p></body></html>

Horror genre fanatics and detrators know of the obvious artistic defects and omissions always inherantly found in 95 percent of all  horror offerings.  Yet, when George A Romero's Night of the Living Dead  became an unimaginable horror movie milestone back in 1969. Heads began to  roll both in awe and in complete disgust of this overwhelmingly bleak black  and white cheaply made account of a zombie apocalypse taking place in rural  Pennslyvania. The film's low budget in fact enhanced the film dreary  surrealistic intensity which re-defined the horror genre the same way  Hitchcock's Psycho had done nine years earlier.  Dawn of the Dead was  Romero's official sequal to that movie masterpiece, and he did have some  very large expectations to live up to.  Filmed in 1978, the film takes  the anxieties and paranoia about human transgressions, materialism,  self-preservation, and greed and builds upon these fine foundations. Then  Romero craftily created an awe inspiring cinematic orgy of gore, gunfire,  entrails, decapitations, body explosions galore, make-up special effects,  human disenbowelment, and an un-godly display of stage blood to create the  70's ultimate movie gore fest, and now Romero was filming his canvas in  color!  Suprisingly beyond this seemingly intolerable barage of gore,  Romero had create a tour de force presentation of how brutal huanity is  willing to extend itself for self-preservation.  The un-believable reality  that Romero had fabricated such a remarkable amount of intelligent critical  analysis upon the the American Commercial or Materialstic culture through  the forum of a horror movie is the greatest shock of them all.  If you  can handle this unbelieveable gore attack upon your senses you will find an  unapprecated horror film masterpiece that deserves to be cherished. Dawn's  philosophical, religious, and moral implicatons  are just as thrillingly  enjoyable as all the film's other more obvious contents. Dawn of the Dead  is the ultimate artistic intellectual horror film that mightbe more real  than you can handle. P.S. Watch through thecredits.</p></body></html>

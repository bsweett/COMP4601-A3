The movie properly begins in a "Little America" housing compound in Saudi Arabia, where we become uncomfortably aware of an impending terrorist attack. The attack itself is horrific, killing dozens of Americans and Saudis, and seemingly involving members of the Saudi police guarding the compound.<br /><br />FBI Special Agent Fleury (a steely-eyed Jamie Foxx) works a deal to get his Evidence Response Team into Saudi Arabia over State Department objections.  On the long flight over, we are introduced to Fleury's team: forensic expert Janet Mayes (a stalwart Jennifer Garner), explosives expert Grant Sykes (played with good-old-boy charm by Chris Cooper), and computer expert Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman).<br /><br />Their escort on the ground is Saudi Police Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (an agonized and movie-stealing performance by Ashraf Barhoum) who has been directed to keep the team alive and get them out of Saudi Arabia as soon as media needs have been met.  However, Fleury and his team are here to solve the crime, and they gradually win the trust of COL Al Ghazi and his assistant Sergeant Haythem (Ali Suliman).  Together, they begin to track down the killer, a murderous local terrorist cell leader.<br /><br />The atmosphere of the movie is brooding and intense, even claustrophic, as the team unravels the crime under a relentless sun, surrounded by Saudis of uncertain allegiance.  Their increasing success draws retaliation from the terrorists.  In a shocking freeway ambush, one of their number is kidnapped.  The survivors and COL Al Ghazi set off in hot pursuit, ending up in a dense urban neighborhood owned by the terrorists.  The ensuing gunfight is the payoff scene of the movie, a breathless sequence made even more intense by some superb cinimatography.<br /><br />Director Peter Berg for the most part avoided the temptation to politicize the movie.  An awkward attempt to suggest that violence begats violence is undercut by the stark moral differences between the FBI Team and their Saudi Police allies, and the murderous terrorists.<br /><br />The widescreen DVD includes deleted scenes that provide some useful exposition on how the team got into Saudi Arabia.  A separate feature breaks down the fast-moving climatic gunfight.  This movie is highly recommended as an intense and well crafted action thriller.</p></body></html>

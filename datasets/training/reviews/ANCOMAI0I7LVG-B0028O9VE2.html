Brooks is one of the best film directors to ever walk the planet, because so many others have already pointed that out and really, most complaints directed at `Spanglish' are based on the fact that it just doesn't live up to the reputation that surrounds Brooks.<br /><br />I came at this from a different approach.<br /><br />Instead of looking at the director, I came at this looking at the star; Adam Sandler.  Now, Adam and I have a rocky relationship.  His early comedic work, in my opinion, was fresh and exciting (`Happy Gilmore' is still a uproarious ride).  His recent work is repetitive and crude.  He has slivers of greatness achieved, most notably when working with strong co-stars (as was the case in '50 First Dates') but he has recently become the worst part of any film he is in (see the dreadfully conceived `I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry').  So, watching `Spanglish' seemed like walking into a trap.<br /><br />I mean this is Sandler meets Brooks; not a combination for the most fluid offering.<br /><br />And that is the most disturbing part of `Spanglish', it just doesn't flow.  What starts off like a chaotic comedy that just needs a touch of focus turns, almost too suddenly, into a heartbreaking drama.  I mean, it feels like two very different films.  There needed to be some balance.<br /><br />Ok, so while I'm laying out faults I'll just spill it all right here.  The initial premise is kind of cheesy in a total `that would never happen, would it' kind of way.  Having the whole story told in a college essay submission seems, at a glance, to be inspired, but it isn't, and the way the essay is closed is rather stupid (and watching a group of adults smiling ridiculously over the essay itself got the film started off on a weird note).  The character development, especially within the relationships, is choppy at best.  John, the perfect husband, is too perfect.  It just doesn't make sense.  Deborah is a total mess, but for me she was the most understandable of the characters.  Sure, she was insane and kind of (or more than kind of) irritating but she was emotionally unstable and remarkably human (especially when the film takes that sudden turn and her performance is required to sell us on everything the script cannot).  For me, I just didn't get Flor.  I mean, I got what she was trying to do with her daughter and I respect the intention, but she came off a tad underdeveloped, and her character is the crux of the entire film.  The relationship that buds between her and John is predictable and annoying.<br /><br />Oh, and Cloris Leachman is hilarious, even if her character is BEYOND clich&eacute;d and feels like an afterthought.<br /><br />But, the film has surprising heart.  I loved the character of Bernice.  I mean, she had such depth even if her character was underwritten (Sarah Steele was the star of this show for me).  Tea Leoni was all sorts of manic brilliance here, and the way she sells that sudden scene of destitution was FLAWLESS (in fact, despite being totally out of no where and kind of unbalanced, that scene is the best part of the film and shows so clearly how this film COULD have been had the script been more focused).<br /><br />It tries, and it succeeds in parts, but the overall feel of `Spanglish' is that it just doesn't know what it wants to do.  It tries to hard to sell the `funny' in the beginning and then it tries too hard to sell the `drama' in the end.  It comes off choppy with moments of brilliance masked by layers of missed opportunities.</p></body></html>

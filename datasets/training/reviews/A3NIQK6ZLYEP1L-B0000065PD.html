<meta name="summary" content="In a way, a very realistic movie..."></head><body><p>First off, once you get past the idea of a Stargate the rest kind of falls into place.  The government, with the help of Professor Daniel Jackson (James Spader), figures out how to work it.  Pro. Jackson, with an escort of soliders led by Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) step through it to the other side.<br />They find a desert planet where humans are being made to mine for the same material that the gate was made from.<br />The people are Egyptians who were removed from Earth over 10,000 years ago, by an alien, and even Daniel Jackson can't understand their language because living languages CHANGE.<br />The movie is careful to stay away from many of the cliches of most sci-fi movies but also stays away from having characters which are TOO simple.  Both Daniel and Jack (played by James and Kurt) are real people, not cardboard cut-outs, with all the flaws and merits of our own reality.  The natives are catch between trying to be friendly towards strangers AND not pissing off their Gods.<br />The science and technology used by Ra and his men look very sleek and very real.  From the spaceship to the gliders, everything has a touch of old Egyptian myth mixed with advanced alien know-how.<br />The DVD comes with two versions of the movie, Director's Cut and the theatrical cut, in which the former has audio commentary.  The DVDs also have a great 'Making of Stargate' featurette, a 'Is There a Stargate?' short starring Erich von Daniken himself, trailers, scane access, crew and cast information and production notes.<br />Everything you could want in a DVD set, a mixture of sound science fiction, a touch of great effects and the pinch of old fashion adventure.  This is a great pop corn flick.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

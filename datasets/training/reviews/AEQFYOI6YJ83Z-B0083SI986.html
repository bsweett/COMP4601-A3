<meta name="summary" content="A memorable, emotional film."></head><body><p>Walt Kowalski is a disgruntled widower, a grumpy old man who despises the sedentary lifestyle his children and grandchildren live, who resents the ethnic intrusion into his once all-white neighborhood, who is angry at the God who took his wife away and the priest who tries to comfort him.  Walt just wants to be left alone; his idea of happiness is sitting on the porch with a beer and his dog.<br /><br />But that changes when a Hmong gang enters the neighborhood, hell-bent on recruiting the boy next door.  Walt intervenes, and from then on the neighborhood takes a shine to him, whether he wants them to or not.  It is a relationship that will draw Walt out of his shell...with some funny, emotional, and tragic consequences.<br /><br />GRAN TORINO is spectacular.  It is easily Eastwood's finest directorial piece, and I'm willing to go out on a limb and say it features his best performance to boot.  The flaws here are few and far between; the main flaw is that, in his quest for authenticity, Eastwood hired an all-Hmong supporting cast, many of whom aren't professional actors (and you can tell).  It's a small price to pay, however, for a movie that hits you on all emotional levels: it's funny, suspenseful, and heart-breaking.  There aren't very many emotional punches, thank God, but when they come they are knockouts.  If Eastwood were to stop making films now (and let's pray he doesn't), he could rest easily on the laurels of GRAN TORINO, content in the fact that he has made an American classic (again).</p></body></html>

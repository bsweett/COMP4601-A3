I loved the movie, but it wasn't perfect. A lot of the problems others have hated about it, never bothered me. I want to write it a glorious review because it's Indy, I had fun, and this character means a lot to me. 1984's "Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom" was my introduction to the character and his world, and it was a childhood shaping experience for me. Saw it in the theater 10 times. It means a lot, and so did this movie. Indy's return. There are little creaks here and there, but I enjoyed the heck out of most of it. I've already written two other reviews for it elsewhere, but took a long time to do this one. Why?. For it to settle in and to really get my thoughts, since those other reviews I wrote seemed to be based in childhood nostalgia for me and could of been better. Again, this has been a tough movie for me to review.<br /><br />First and foremost, Indiana Jones is back after a 19 year absence from our silver screens. There is no doubt that it is a most welcome return, nor is there any doubt that Indy is still Indy, or that Harrison Ford can still deliver the goods. Plot-wise, it doesn't hold up as much. Indy tries to find a crystal skull before those pesky russians(headlined by Cate Blanchett, who is both good and channeling femme fatale Natasha from "Rocky And Bullwinkle")do, and so on and so on. It's really nothing new and, quite frankly, gets kinda confusing and bizarre as it goes along. Story and plot is not KOTCS's strongest suit. Along for the adventure is Marlon Brando wannabe Mutt(Shia LaBeauf), as well as Indy's former love, Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen).<br /><br />KOTCS is both steeped in warm nostalgia and a new world. It's Indy, looks like Indy, feels like Indy, but there is something different. Coming almost two decades later, that's to be expected. Director Steven Spielberg is still a master at directing summer popcorn fare, and he knows how to do a tight action scene(key being the motorcycle chase thru campus)like nobody else. Effects wise, there are some startling moments and some very CGI moments, but the CGI never distracted me from the movie like it did others. In fact, I thought it all looked really good. After a while, you do long for the good old days of the earlier Indy films, but it still worked for me. And Spielberg, well, there is still plenty of Spielberg magic left in the guy, and some of that is on display here.<br /><br />Harison Ford is 65. So what?. He doesn't look much older or different than he did 10 years ago, and he is in incredible shape. He's a man's man, and a man's hero, and he is more than up to snuff to put the fedora back on. He and the character are a bit older, but nothing much else has changed. He still hates snakes(in one of the film's funniest and most endearing moments), and he still has that spark. LaBeauf is not the 'Jar Jar Binks' of the movie. He is quite charming, actually, and more than holds his own. It was also great to see Karen Allen back, but I felt she was relegated to just 'one of the gang', and wasn't given all that she could of been given. Still, she did a fine job, and she looks incredible. Not much difference with her either.<br /><br />In the end, KOTCS is a fun movie. It's an entertaining movie. It's an Indiana Jones movie. Some of it is silly, some of it is exciting, and all of it is fun to watch from beginning to end. The story of the film is shaky, and as the film goes along, it gets even more wobbly. The climax to the plot is somewhat head scratching, and I am still torn by it. But the very, very end of the movie, the last scene, is fantastic. All in all, it was a nearly 20 year reunion in the making and, for the most part, it was most welcomed. Like any reunion with someone in some place you haven't been in decades, there are some awkward moments, but it's still a good experience and you are glad you went.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is the film that iconicized Al Pacino, mang!"></head><body><p>Al Pacino was without a doubt a well-respected actor who had &quot;made his bones&quot; with any number of defining roles prior to his portrayal of Tony Montana in this Brian DePalma remake of the 1932 Howard Hawks &quot;Scarface&quot; based loosely on the life of Al Capone.  And in truth he's done some terrific work since, as well (&quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot;, &quot;The Devil's Advocate&quot;, &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, to name a few).<p>But this movie, thanks mainly to Pacino's merciless performance, has done more for pop culture than anything else he's ever been associated with.  That crazy over-the-top Marielito accent has been (badly) imitated more often among a generation of movie fans who weren't even out of diapers when &quot;Scarface&quot; was released back in 1983 than Marlon Brando's cotton-cheeked Don Corleone was mimicked since he came onto the scene in 1972; &quot;SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND&quot; has become the &quot;YOU TALKIN' TO ME?&quot; of the closing stages of the 20th Century.<p>&quot;Scarface&quot; practically invented the culture behind the hip-hop lifestyle, and this is brilliantly conveyed in the Def Jam featurette &quot;Origin of a Gangsta&quot; included on the second disc of this two-disc set, one of the most unique (and well-placed) special features ever to be included with a feature presentation; a director's commentary audio track would probably have been better appreciated, but the documentary footage included on the second disc mostly makes up for it.<p>The movie itself never looked better.  I never saw the previous DVD format, so I can't make a comparison, but it absolutely blows my old VHS tapes out of the water.  The 2.35:1 widescreen ratio is fantastic and all of Miami in its cocaine-addled '80's glory shines off the TV screen like a great big p****, just waitin' to get f*****...but I digress.  The sound is fantastic, and just when you think the movie has been dragging for too long, the last fifteen minutes exhilerates you to the point where you're ready to watch the whole thing all over again.<p>If this gangster movie isn't in a class by itself, it won't take long to call the roll.  If you EVER suspected that you might like gangster movies but want a different take on the genre than the NYC goombah angle, this is the flick for you.  And if you're a fan of Al Pacino...well, chances are you've already seen it at least five times...so what are you waiting for?  Buy it at once!</p></body></html>

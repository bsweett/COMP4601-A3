<meta name="summary" content="Joaquin Phoenix follows in Jamie Foxx's footsteps, only Phoenix is Johnny Cash"></head><body><p>Joaquin (Leaf) Phoenix (Ladder 49, Clay Pigeons) blazes and exlpodes emotionally and terrifically as the man in black, Johnny Cash, just as Jamie Foxx did last year when he played legendary Ray Charles. Phoenix had to learn how to play the guitar and know 26 Cash songs, along with Reese Witherspoon (Just Like Heaven, Vanity Fair) in her best performance so far in her career as the woman Cash fell deeply in love with, June Carter. Witherspoon gives a flawlessly performance...its really fabulous. It begins with Cash and his band at the Folsom Prison but then goes into flashbacks when Cash was a little boy and a tradgic death shook his family. Cash never got along with his father, played by Robert Patrick (Tv's The X-Files, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and they had a shaky relationship. Then, they show how Mr. Cash married his first wife, played by Ginnifer Goodwin and Cash had 2 kids and how he started his band and his music career making his first record, to breaking in at 14 on the top charts and growing more and more famous. He also had a pill and booze addiction, sometimes too much and he'd get angry, wreck things or look really sick....they show how he collapsed one time performing on stage. It also shows how he grew more and more in love with June Carter but she wouldnt take him, but she couldnt help but come back into his life and eventually she accepted to marry him during one of their performances. One of the best movies of the year without a doubt and Phoenix is a masterwork here almost coming close to sounding like the man himself. A truly great achievement and two great unforgettable performances. "Hello....I'm Johnny Cash!!!!"</p></body></html>

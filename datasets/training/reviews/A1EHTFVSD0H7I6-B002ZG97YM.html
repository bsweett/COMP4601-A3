<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining and Fun But I Have One Whiny Little Rant"></head><body><p>How to Train a Dragon is a coming of age movie. The usual stuff. The overbearing father, with the son who embarrasses him because of his lack of mini-me-ness, tries to force said son to man-it-up and get on with it already. Son does the one thing he can think of to impress his whole village but screws even that up. But while doing so he discovers truth that will change everything his dad, his whole village, his whole world believed. Add humor, fighting, action and a few scary moments, make it animated, throw in a love interest and lots of dragons and you've got an entertaining movie. My Viking fanatic friend would have a hissy regarding the Viking hats. Apparently the Vikings did not have horns on their helmets. But I digress.<br /><br />My one complaint. It's a kid movie with enough stuff to draw in the adults and keep their attention, too, but they took it beyond dragons. There is a mini makeout scene. And the tough girl love interest throws out some very realistic stand-in "cuss" words during a temper tantrum. Not needed. I don't know if those elements are thrown in for teens, to get them interested. But for the 8-10 year old little boys, all it would take is the dragons....</p></body></html>

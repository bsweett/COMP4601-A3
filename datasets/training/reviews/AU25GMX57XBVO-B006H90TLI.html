<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good movie but not sure about best picture award"></head><body><p>This is a pretty good movie and I had to watch it twice to say so yet I don't know about the best picture nomination.  I have not seen some of it's competitors from 2007 but maybe after I do could agree.  The storyline is well written I think but it seemed to lack that personal touch I usually get from a great movie.  The ending I thought was so so and I think had to watch the movie another time to understand the ending.  Thought some of the more violent scenes were a little to violent but that can sometimes help a movie.  Overall should keep your attention well from the beginning to then end and then you can decide if it deserves best picture nomination.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></body></html>

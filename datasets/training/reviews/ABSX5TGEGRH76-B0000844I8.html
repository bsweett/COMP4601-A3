Stargate's story is the reason for its success.  The movie tells the story of a race of aliens that used (notice how I did not say built) an interstellar portal, called a Stargate, in order to bring humans to a new planet for slave labor.  This all happened during the time of ancient Egypt, so there is a disticnt Egyptian flavor throughout the film, which I found very intriguing.  In 1928, archeaologists find the Stargate and are baffled by it.  In the present day, the Stargate is in the hands of the United States Air Force, and they hire an Egyptologist named Daniel Jackson (James Spader) to decipher the markings on the gate.  Jackson is somewhat infamous in his field, because he denies that humans built the pyramids.  He believes that it was done by aliens, but he has no proof to back it up.  The Air Force also brings in an old retired colonel, named Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) in order to "supervise" the project.  Once Jackson gets the Stargate operational, a team, led by O'Neil and including Jackson for scientific purposes, goes through the gate and ends up on a planet in a galaxy far far away (sorry, I couldn't help myself).  On the planet, they encounter other humans who still speak ancient Egyptian as well as a race of humanoid aliens who are keeping the men as slaves.<br />The story is very inventive and it is what finally saved the movie for me.  Spader did okay in his role, but Russell seemed to have two modes: angry and sarcastic.  One thing that I didn't understand was that Russell gets top billing, but the movie is essentially about Spader's Jackson.  Also, I didn't like Ra (Jaye Davidson), the leader of the aliens.  He was a good character, but he was so creepy just because he looks so much like a woman!  I could barely look at him it was so disturbing.  But besides these two things, Stargate is a great movie.  The effects are great, and as I have already stated, the story is amazing.</p></body></html>

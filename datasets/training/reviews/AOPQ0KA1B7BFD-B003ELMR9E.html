<meta name="summary" content="Surprising Quality from a Quad Pack!"></head><body><p>Update:  Not sure why my review has been moved to the movie Insomnia, but the review I wrote below is for a Quad Pack DVD package that includes Insomnia, Heat, The Devil's Advocate, and Seven. Unless you are considering a purchase of the Quad package, the review below will not be much help because it deals with the transfer quality of the movies, not the movies themselves.<br /><br />Okay, you probably know the movies, so no need to review them.  Chances are you have interest in one or more of the movies but aren't quite sure whether to pull the trigger due to the Quad Pack packaging.  I wanted The Devil's Advocate plus Heat and it was less expensive to get them packaged like this than separately.  I was just suspicious of what kind of quality transfer I'd get, but what the heck, I took the risk and ordered it.<br /><br />As soon as I get a blu-ray or DVD movie I pop it my HD system to see the quality of the transfer.  Then I rate it from 1 to 5, 1 being perfect, 2 digital sharp, 3 marginal, 4 poor, and 5 unwatchable.  I'm always suspicious of Double-Triple-Quad movie packs because the quality of the transfer to DVD is generally a lower quality.  That isn't the case with this quad pack.  Granted, my rating scale is subjective but I have a discerning eye.  All four movies in this pack rated as a 2 for digital sharp.  One of the DVD movies, Seven, even came with the DTS sound option.  The other 3 were Dolby 5.1.<br /><br />There are two double sided DVDs in the quad pack, a movie on each side.  The only criticism of the discs is you have to have a magnifying glass to read the center rim label to see which movie you're popping in the player.  Thankfully each movie is just as nice as a single disc, keepcase DVD.<br /><br />Overall, this DVD quad pack is definitely worth the price.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""I'm the ghost with the most babe""></head><body><p>This is an early film in Tim Burton's career,shortly after Pee Wee's Big Adventure where you get to see his off humor,art and design poured into the film.This is a Tim Burton classic hands down and I love the humor put into the story(spoken or not).Some strong four letter metephores are thrown upon occassion in some of the dialog,so parents beware if you have little ones watching.Other than that,you have an entertaining story of a young couple who die sudenly and are thrown into the world of the dead without a clue of how,why and what to do?Pathetic attempts are made to scare and rid their home of an undesireable yuppie family.In desperation(even after being warned) they decide to employ the gifts and tallents of Beettlejuice,and it turns out they get more than they bargined for.I only wish there was more screen time with Michael keaton/Beettlejuice,it is damn funny.While the living mingle with the dead in an effort to make a circus of their "paranormal hosts" Beetlejuice is put into action again by Lydia to save them.So,"say it once,say it twice...third time is the charm!"Experience Beettlejuice for yourself,and if you are a Tim Burton fan or new to his films,you are in for a real treat.</p></body></html>

This leads him to a love of the finer flavors food has to offer, much to the puzzlement of his garbage eating brethren. His father has made him the clan's rat-poison detector, but Remy secretly yearns to become a great chef, and he risks life and limb to learn how by getting dangerously close to the human world. One night, however, things go horribly wrong and the whole group is forced to scatter from the cottage they have been furtively inhabiting. Remy soon finds himself separated from the others, being swept away through the sewer system and coming up under a fine restaurant in the heart of Paris. It's a dream come true for Remy, but when he can't control his urge to tamper with the dishes, he soon finds himself in a deceptive partnership with the hapless new garbage-boy, Alfredo Linguini. With Remy literally under his hat, Linguini quickly becomes the hot new chef in the city of light! But his boss, head chef Skinner, smells a rat, and the famed food critic Anton Ego poses no less a danger; not to mention the health inspector!<br /><br />To the Disney animation fan, "Ratatouille" may evoke memories of a cartoon short called "Ben and Me," or even the classic story of Cyrano de Bergerac. But, don't sell this film short based on that. It's full of originality, heart, fun, excitement, and charm! Heavy on the Euro-atmosphere, and appropriately so, "Ratatouille" dives deep into the world of the culinary arts, making it a perfect film for an age when Emeril Lagasse and Rachael Ray are household names and shows like "Iron Chef" are hot stuff! Patton Oswalt is the star of the show as the perfect voice for the endearing Remy the rat, whose desire to be a great chef fuels his hope for a world where humans and rats can live together with mutual respect. The entire film is a feast for the senses in itself, as one always expects from PIXAR, and I definitely would call it several steps up from their last offering, "Cars," which I found to be enjoyable, but not quite up to expectations (storywise). "Ratatouille," on the other hand, is fairly unpredictable, smart, and thoroughly enjoyable, and, in my opinion, among PIXAR's best stuff. Director Brad Bird's animation track record remains excellent!<br /><br />Also worth mentioning is the deeper level to the film's story that may click with animation fans if they dare to take a closer look. "Ratatouille" could almost be called PIXAR's autobiography, telling the story of how a little studio that was bringing something new to the table had to stand on the shoulders of a giant and struggle to earn respect and a following amidst doubting peers, patrons, and critics. Deceased master chef Gusteau is clearly a take on the great Walt Disney himself, with his restaurant representing the Disney Studios trying to keep the magic going without him (and sticking to his proven recipes). Of course, looking at the film in that light puts an entirely different spin on it and opens the gates to all sorts of fascinating ideas as to just what PIXAR is saying about whom.<br /><br />This thankfully widescreen DVD edition, unfortunately, is less than worthy of the masterpiece it holds. Probably in an effort to encourage upgrading to Blu-Ray, but perhaps for other reasons, PIXAR has really gone downhill in the extras department. There are some sweet ones, but so few in comparison to previous releases, particularly those two-discers that came out prior to the "Cars" DVD. All this edition offers are 3 deleted scenes (though nicely put together), 2 Easter Eggs, a featurette where director Brad Bird and chef Thomas Keller talk about their passions for their work, and the highlights, two original animated shorts. The first short is "Lifted," the theatrical short that was shown with "Ratatouille." This is a cute, physical comedy short about an alien abductor in training who is having trouble beaming up his sleeping victim. The second one I found HIGHLY enjoyable. It's called, "Your Friend the Rat," and is a hilarious lesson in rat-history hosted by Remy and his brother, Emile. What makes this particularly enjoyable is how its random art styles hark back to the days of Ludwig Von Drake and shorts like, "It's Tough to be a Bird." A wonderful treat for the fan of classic Disney animation, and a fine compliment to another outstanding PIXAR feature achievement.</p></body></html>

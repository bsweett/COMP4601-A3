<meta name="summary" content="Silly but entertaining shenanigans"></head><body><p>Of course, you'll have to suspend all common sense to get through this digital effects sci-fi 'thriller,' But you'll be very entertained, even if the plot has holes like the Grand Canyon. Why do these terrorists want to nuke LA? We are not told. I guess they planned to commit suicide when the bomb goes off. Anyway, Nick Cage plays a Vegas magician with "precognition," i.e., he sees the future, but only 2 minutes ahead and only if it involves himself. Just for ha-has, they make him fall for luscious Jessica Biel, because who wants to look at balding, jowly Nick Cage for 90 minutes? He is way, way too old for Jessica, but no matter. The avalanche and the nuclear explosion look very digital, as do the many scenes of Nick melting and morphing and zigzagging backward and forward in time. Smartly, this is very quick at 90 minutes, and you won't be bored.</p></body></html>

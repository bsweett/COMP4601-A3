<meta name="summary" content="Amazing---Foxx is one of the best actors of this century"></head><body><p>Giving life to a character who only exists on the printed page is a challenge to an actor.  Making your performance mimic that of a real life person with as much vitality and genius as Ray Charles would almost be an Olympian endeavor.  Maybe in twenty or so years it wouldn't be, but there are many people who have grown up with Charles' music, seen him live, and on television.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx worked blindfolded alongside Ray Charles to learn to play piano, walk, move like a blind man.  How he managed to imbue the role with the soul of the man, is comparable in acting to Charles' musical talent.<br /><br />No, the story isn't pretty.  Charles moved from alcohol to heroin with almost the same rocket-like speed as his career.  He also had affairs with his backup singers.  The movie doesn't gloss over any of this--or the dues he paid as consequences.<br /><br />The music is wonderful--overseen by Mr. Charles before his death, the acting is superb.  Overall, the movie's an inspiration and very worth having in your collection.<br /><br />I do not recommend the long version for entertainment's sake.  The added scenes are poorly edited and choppily inserted.  Plus you have an annoying 'helpful' icon to tell you that what you are watching has been added.  In theory, I like the concept of the icon.  In application, I'm glad they give a choice of short or long versions because I actually prefer the short one.</p></body></html>

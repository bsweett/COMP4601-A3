<meta name="summary" content="Four Friends Make a Date with Destiny in a Hot Tub - and This is What Happens..."></head><body><p>I never thought I'd be giving Hot Tub Time Machine a 5-star rating, but this is funny stuff.  It's literally a step back into the good / bad ol' days of 80s comedies but a far more informed and self-conscious eye.<br /><br />What if you had to go back to the 80s and relive legwarmers, spandex and hair metal (on a ski resort no less) and PRETEND to be comfortable?  is the superficial premise, but this owes more to Groundhog Day meets (name your 80s flick)...<br /><br />Everything seems to fall into place like a hot dog on a bun.  At times cheesy, at times bizarre, but never hokey - the film just works.  The characters are brilliantly crafted and played by the Ensemble.  It's especially interesting to see John Cusack - a star who found fame in the 1980s produce and star in this.  Aside from Cusack in his usual good guy role, Craig Robinson and Rob Corddry are absolutely brilliant as his loser friends.  I thought this was way better than the Hangover; and the soundtrack aces The Wedding Singer...nuff said.</p></body></html>

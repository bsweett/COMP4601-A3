<meta name="summary" content="A sad, bittersweet, deeply moving football tale"></head><body><p>Billy Bob Thorton is an actor that creates a rare psychological effect in the movies he makes. In his best roles (1998's A Simple Plan, 2001's Monster's Ball, this movie) he is so understated and so quietly graceful that the movie goes on around him and the awareness that a great actor is before us disappears. In Friday Night Lights, Thorton occupies such a low-key wavelength that I'm still wondering why he got that starring credit. It's a testament to the pitch-perfect casting of the film, and the wonderful young actors who play the roles, that any supporting player could have had his name in bold on the poster and it would have made sense.<br /><br />  In Lights, Thorton is coach Gary Gaines, the mastermind behind the football juggernaut in Odessa Texas: the Permian Panthers. Gaines is at the head of a team with state championships under its belt, a gigantic reputation in its desolated surroundings, and a football stadium that dwarfs everything within miles of it. This is not Gaines' movie, though; Lights wisely focuses in on the young men who make up the team and the way their lives shape what goes into the game. The best performance of the movie belongs to quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), whose precise Texas drawl and shy personality make for a fascinating contrast with the louder guys on the team. Speaking of louder guys: there's Derek Luke of Antwone Fisher who plays Boobie Miles, the superstar of the team who gets a little life lesson of his own once the season begins.<br /><br />  It's actual history, the fall of 1988, but David Aaron Cohen's adaptation of the book by H.G. Bissinger brings the inhabitants of the team and the town alive so that a real narrative progresses before your eyes. But the central idea behind Lights that you might have before seeing it is misleading: this is not a movie about a triumphant football team who starts a losing streak and has it all come down to a defining moment at state championships. Lights is a bittersweet tale of the disappointment, uncertainty, and occasional bleakness that accompanies a life totally consumed by a sport. The movie doesn't turn a head away from the fact that, yeah, some football players can't read really well (a particularly triumphant moment in my own mind :) ), they often go on to drive trucks and sell insurance instead of playing pro ball, and sometimes things are such a damn letdown you can't do anything but yank off your helmet and crash into a ball of heaving sobs.<br /><br />  Friday Night Lights has moments of searing brilliance, propelled forward with an atmospheric musical score, but in the end it fails to make that final leap into greatness that it could have. I can't help but admire this film, though, for its bravery in the story that it has to tell. This is not the uplifting sports movie that will run over and over again on TBS a few years from now. This is a 'sports movie' that I thought about for quite a while after leaving the theater. With football, it seems it's all about winning; what Friday Night Lights makes us realize is that there's often more loss, in the very deepest sense of the word. B+</p></body></html>

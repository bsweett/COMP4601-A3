<meta name="summary" content="A Beautiful Tragedy"></head><body><p>House of Sand and Fog is a commentary on the cultural gap between American-born citizens and immigrants from war-ridden countries such as Iran. Unfortunately that gap is shown for what it is: wider than ever.<br /><br />The character of Kathy is portrayed brilliantly by Jennifer Connelly as an emotionally unstable young woman caught up in the turmoil of losing both her husband and her family's home within eight months of each other.  Her character is pinned against Ben Kingsley's Colonel Behrani when Behrani buys Kathy's auctioned house in order to return his own family to a sense of stability.  The catalyst for the two characters' conflict with each other is drawn from the supporting character of Officer Lester Burdon (Ron Eldard), a representation of the ignorance and lack of empathy some feel towards people whose lives have led them to seek better ones in the United States. While Behrani's main motive is to protect his family and give it a sense of security, Lester puts his own selfish pleasures before the wellbeing of his own family. Behrani and Lester are complete opposites, Behrani clearly the nobler.  The film shows that there are greater sacrifices in this world than those materialistic in nature.  This type of film truly will tug at your heart and bring tears, yet will give a sense of appreciation for the human life.<br /><br />On a side note, at times I found it difficult to concentrate on this movie because I was distracted by Ron Eldard.  He's very pleasing to the eye ;)</p></body></html>

I know nothing about Miss Page, except that she has "it" on screen, and I am not talking about sex appeal. The movie goes on too long, and its ending is unsatisfying, since the motive for the Page character's activities is tossed off with a few words and no explanation as to how the whole series of events came to unfold. The director's choices of black screen transitions between scenes gets annoying as well. The reason for seeing this is to watch what I presume is the beginning of a great career for Ellen, and one more piece of quality work for Patrick, whom I enjoyed greatly in both "The Alamo" and in "Phantom of the Opera." But if you are squeamish about danger, tension, and degradation, skip this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="second rate action thriller"></head><body><p>In "Sahara," Matthew McConaughey plays an archaeologist/adventurist with a bit of a quixotic streak (he even has his own Sancho Panza-type comic relief sidekick to accompany him on his adventures) and a full-on action-hero name (Dirk Pitt).  Dirk's impossible dream - get this - involves finding and salvaging an ironclad ship from the American Civil War that he believes somehow made its way across the entire Atlantic Ocean before it sank in a river in Africa!  In his search for the unlikely relic, Dirk soon finds himself knee deep in trouble, trying to make his way through a country ruled by a vicious, bloodthirsty warlord and torn asunder by chaos.  Penelope Cruz plays a World Health Organization official determined to enter the country to help stave off a plague that seems to be taking hold there.  The two of them, both with markedly different motives, wind up joining forces as they take on the murderous thugs and corrupt officials who are determined to stop them from reaching their goals.<br /><br />"Sahara" is one of those movies in which a bunch of beautiful people wisecrack their way through one death-defying adventure after another - with an occasional time out for platonic romance and a moment or two of social conscience.  The problem here, though, is that the humor is pretty wan overall and the action sequences strictly standard-issue in nature.  The acting, too, is pretty shallow, with McConaughey spending most of his time flexing his muscles, and Cruz making the most glamorous and least convincing ambassador of goodwill to a third world country since Angelina Jolie tried the same stunt a few years back.  And, of course, as is the case with so many of these films, "Sahara" reduces complex geopolitical realities to little more than simpleminded melodramatic cliches.<br /><br />As the movie drags on, the plot becomes more and more ridiculous at every turn and the stunts more and more over-the-top, with the whole shebang culminating in one of those hail-to-Dorothy-the-Wicked-Witch-is-dead - type endings that is as corny as it is preposterous.  Chances are, though, that you'll have dusted off the sands of "Sahara" long before that point.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="OUTSTANDING!"></head><body><p>The film continues to shed light on (the very well known by now) Harry Potter, as he attends his second year at Hogwarts.  His powers are growing and so is the mystery surrounding his true purpose in life...<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure with strong elements of fantasy, not to mention some very witty humor.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felton, Alan Rickman, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again.<br /><br />The concept, the setting, the special effects, and the music, are all EXCELLENT!  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.  In short, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!</p></body></html>

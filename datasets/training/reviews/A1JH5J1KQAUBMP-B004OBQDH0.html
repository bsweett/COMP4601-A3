<meta name="summary" content="My Review, Part I"></head><body><p>Now maturing into young adults, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) are on their own and on the run from Death Eaters as they search for the scattered pieces of Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul and an ultimate weapon that will destroy it forever.<br /><br />The ultimate judgment of this final installment must await the release of Part II next year, but this is a promising start.  In a series with such a large cast and such a convoluted storyline, it is good to see a renewed emphasis on character.  This is the brilliance in spreading this final episode out over two films (apart from the extra dollars to be made).  Many of the other films have felt rushed, and the scenes in which our heroes camp out in isolation would surely have been greatly curtailed if not cut altogether without the breathing room this approach provides.  I appreciate that director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves did not pack in a few more breathless escapes or big action set pieces.  Instead, we have a chance to get reacquainted with the three protagonists and spend some quiet time with them before the explosive climax that is sure to come.</p></body></html>

You cannot yell at them to "stop" or "wait" or "Jason it's your mother" Imagine being pursued by something so familiar as a human being , knowing that its no longer functioning on your level. It is now a stumbling, or running eating machine that you have to get away from quickly lest it scratches or bites you. The thought of turning into one of them, is incomprehensible. Other monsters such as vampires or werewolves that still have human form retain their intelligence to a point, they can still enjoy a cup of wine or watch Friends on TBS. Zombies, on the other hand, exist only to feed on your flesh , slowly rotting away till there is nothing left but a jiggling mass of putrid goo. We love our lifestyles and we all know that zombies equal the downfall of society, and that's horrific to us!<br /><br /> Filmmakers either get the undead or they don't. George Romero gets it, that's indisputable. He gets them because he gets human nature. Zach Snyder also gets them he just has a different take. Romero's visions have always been based in the sociological mythos, Snyder touches on that but really takes the movie to a more basic level, which is to shock and scare you. Romero's zombies frighten me in a different way than Snyder's, they are shuffling mindless prolific husks who keep coming, ever so slowly to eat you. Snyder's zombies are gory bloody hungry and running at you full speed, they are more like animals, but you don't dare pet them.<br /><br /> I went into Dawn of The Dead expecting to leave disappointed, I thought that it would be a fumbling mess of clich&eacute;s and quick camera work and bad acting. I was so blown away by it that I couldn't believe what I had just seen. It was like going into the "tunnel of blood" at the county fair and the Paper Mache monsters had come to life.  The music was right (and that is so important!), the actors were amazing especially Sarah Polley and Jake Weber. It had slick jokes, mind blowing special effects and I swear I left nail marks permanently in my husbands arm because I was so scared. I was whipped around emotionally, my heart was in my throat, and I was so completely satisfied I almost wept with joy. You really have to get the Unrated Directors cut to get the whole experience; the extra features on the disc were worth it. I love a good commentary.<br /><br /> The only bad part of the whole movie, and I see that other reviewers have pointed this out, was the zombie baby. My problem is the baby itself, not that I am upset by it, just that the effects used weren't good enough so I wouldn't have even tried it. It is really hard to do anything scary with babies without them being animatronically laughable or in this case mediocre CGI.</p></body></html>

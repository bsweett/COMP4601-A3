<meta name="summary" content="Fairly good slasher import!"></head><body><p>three traveling young people in Australia travel the country to Wolf Creek national park until their car dies. A bushman (John Jarrat) comes to their help fixing their car but they think he might be a great friend until they discover what he really is.<br /><br />Inspired by a true incident in the late 90's in Australia, this Australian horror import is one of the better horror thrillers of late. It's a grueling and claustrophobic shocker that pushes your nightmares into the big screen, the acting is decent but John Jarrat who plays the Bushman Mick is excellent playing the psychotic Crocodile Dundee-like man. There are some brutal and gory moments that scene realistic and some genuine tension thrown in this movie, it catches the viewers breath and takes it away.<br /><br />This Unrated DVD contains footage never shown in America with some good extras like audio commentary by the filmmakers and stars, A Making of "Wolf Creek" documentary, deleted scene and theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Also recommended: "Funny Games", "Last House on The Left", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Series & 2003 remake with The Beginning", "Maniac (1980)", "Hostel 1 & 2", "Saw Quadrilogy", "High Tension", "The Hitcher (1986)", "Duel", "Jeepers Creepers", "From Dusk Till Dawn", "Friday The 13th Series", "Halloween Series", "I Spit on Your Grave", "Silence of the Lambs", "Hannibal", "Red Dragon", "Undead", "Scream 1 & 2", "Basic instinct", "Phenomena (a.k.a.

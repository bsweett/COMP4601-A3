There is, unfortunately, very little new material here that hasn't been done before (and done better) in earlier movies.<br /><br />By the way, I'm not usually a stickler for this, but in 2005, can we reasonably start to expect appropriate props and settings in medieval movies? I mean, iron shingles on peasant huts instead of proper straw and thatch? Pulleys and explosives? Bullet-proof vests? "Single-shot" guns which can be fired over a dozen times without reloading? I hate to be picky, but the end result takes the viewer out of the narrative, and jarringly.<br /><br />Past the anachronisms in every frame, the movie is hamstrung by simply not knowing what it wants to be - is it a comedy? Horror? Drama? Action? The genres seem mushed together haphazardly. The slap-stick is lame and stale, the drama is painful and predictable (The Serious Girl is Serious because, you know, she wears pants. Except when she randomly changes into fancy dresses for Dramatic Scenes and Capture Scenes. And, no, we don't believe the Protective Brother will try to steal the girl from the Sensitive Brother, so who does the movie think it is kidding?), the action is slow - to the point where the characters seem to forget what they are doing much of the time - and the horror fails to frighten because, fundamentally, the movie is too silly to take seriously.<br /><br />Oh, yes, and there's an eviscerated kitten. A fluffy one. Thanks, Hollywood.<br /><br />This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing. I do not own this movie and I do not want to own this movie - I rented this through my Blockbuster Online account.</p></body></html>

Freedom from those who would oppress us in every way, from the way we dress, to what we are allowed to believe, even where we are allowed to live, we have always wanted the freedom to choose and to live as we see fit.  In the Revolutionary War, our ancestors that settled here to form the 13 colonies chose to rebel against the oppresive forces of England that had enslaved them all their lives.  Centuries before our ancestors fought for our freedom, Scotland was fighting for theirs from England, and even to this day that fight still continues to some degree.  To bring the story of Scotland's fight for freedom to the big screen, writer Randall Wallace got the attention of Paramount Pictures and Icon Productions who liked the idea, and with Mel Gibson attached to direct and star, everything else just seemed to fall into place for the dark ages epic "Braveheart".<br /><br />"Braveheart" is the story of William Wallace (Mel Gibson), a brave Scotsman who has been lured from his quiet life, when the regional governor kills his wife (Catherine McCormack), to wage war on his country's oppressors.  Using his now famous longsword, fiery rage, and cunning intellect to rally his countrymen to fight for liberation against the King of England (Patrick McGoohan) and his vast army.  Wallace will not rest until Scotland is free or he is dead.<br /><br />This epic film is filled with gigantic battle sequences that accurately depict the brutal, up-close nature of war before there were guns or cannons, when the only way to fight was with swords and bows and arrows.  Expertly directed by Mel Gibson (at this time Mel had only directed one other film "The Man Without a Face", most recently he directed the critically acclaimed "Passion of the Christ"), with brilliant acting by the entire cast including Mel Gibson, who of course had nothing but the best to work with in terms of story, as it was carefully crafted by Randall Wallace (screenwriter of "The Man in the Iron Mask").  "Braveheart" is definitely not a film to be missed by any fan of history or movies.  As a side note, Randall Wallace just so happens to be a descendant of William Wallace, which is why he was so interested in bringing this story to the big screen.<br /><br />If this review hasn't convinced you to see "Braveheart", then you should also know that the year it was released, 1995, it received 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director, though sometimes that doesn't mean a film is necessarily enjoyable to watch, I guarantee with "Braveheart", the awards and accolades it received were well founded.<br /><br />"Braveheart" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.</p></body></html>

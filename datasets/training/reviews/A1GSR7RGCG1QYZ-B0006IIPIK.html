<meta name="summary" content="Run away from the Resistance."></head><body><p>I was actually looking forward to this film when it was released in the theaters.  I originally thought that the premise was original and creative.  Here, on my television, I was seeing images that I normally didn't associate with Hollywood.  Yea, it was big budget, yea it had these larger stars headlining the film (even a dead one), but I thought that perhaps it was one of those under-the-radar hits.  The critics hated it and it even fueled my desire to see it further.  There had to be something redeemable about this film.  Well, I finally had a chance to see it and I, sadly, will have to fence with the critics on this one.  This was an irritating, uncontrollable mess of a film that attempted to be original in every way possible, but instead found itself just being nothing more than a lump of cheap Hollywood mess complete with jumbled characters, a sloppy story, and finally even some overly dull CGI.  This was nothing that the advertisements promoted it would be.<br /><br />The CGI was the immediate draw for me into this film.  I was interested in seeing how director Kerry Conran would handle this feature with only the use of the blue/green screen.  With Lucas completely blowing down the door with modern technology, and the world of Hollywood at your fingertips, I thought that Conran would blow me out of the water.  Sadly, I found myself treading water for a couple of hours to follow.  The CGI seemed messy and fuzzy, blurred around the edges, I found myself squinting at the television and continually wondering what the glow was around each of our characters.  The darkened moments were too light, and the lighted moments were too dark.  It was as if Conran presented to us the rough draft of his project, instead of giving us a final, crisper draft.  I know that it was to represent an older generation and pay homage to that era that birthed the sci-fi genre, but in all honesty this was the black sheep of that generation and genre.  The green/blue screen was my biggest issue with this film.  It hurt my eyes to look at and took my appreciation away for any possibility of creativity and uniqueness.  It was sloppy, for lack of a better word, and I think Conran knew that from the beginning.<br /><br />I think that he knew that it wasn't going to be this crisp feature because he boasted some larger named stars to throttle this film even more.  If he would have focused, yet even promoted, this film on the green/blue screen uniqueness alone, perhaps he would have done a bit better with the critics and box office, but instead we had to be guided through this mess by actors that just couldn't seem to carry their own simple characters.  This was my second major issue for me with this film.  Here you have Jude Law, Oscar-winning Gwyneth Paltrow, and even Oscar-winning Angelina Jolie headlining your film and yet they cannot seem to grasp the characters that they have to portray.  These were simpleton characters that really didn't need to much to fuel them, just some good old fashioned acting, but sadly our friends who are being paid far more than me, just couldn't handle this task.  This shoddy acting caused the chemistry between Law and Paltrow to be as dead as a doornail.  I literally never felt as if these two cared in any way about each other.  It was just another Hollywood pairing that backfired horribly in everyone's faces.  I couldn't even tell if they liked each other as friends it was that poor.  Is it bad when you think that the only actor who seemed to carry their part decently well was Sir Lawrence Olivier?  I think it is bad when a dead actor upstages the best of Hollywood.  There is definitely something wrong with this picture.  This horrible, messy acting with apparent lack of chemistry drew my attention away from the green/blue screen long enough to completely sour my stomach again.  Perhaps the story will lend a better hand ...<br /><br />Wrong again friends.  The story was a classic "Who cares" moment where you witness your characters going through the motions, building the plot to bring us to a conclusion, but you find yourself really just saying "Who cares" throughout all of it.  The already poor use of actors and green/blue screen pushed too much pressure onto the story, which, like an employee on his first day of work, just crumbled under the stress.  There was honestly nothing valuable to the entire story that I can put in this review.  From the over-the-top introduction to the world and Sky Captain to the jumbled mess that was Angelina Jolie, to the final moments where I am sure PETA was up in arms. Even the ending line just forced that final breath of air out of you and made you more excited about returning this film.  It was shameful.<br /><br />Overall, nothing can be pulled and claimed as redeemable for this film.  I will say that the thought was creative, but sadly it was the creation process that ultimately failed this film.  From poor green/blue screen translation to stubble acting with a shoddy story, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is everything the critics claimed and more.  I am not normally one that will take the critics sides, but this film just didn't work anywhere.  I do not suggest it to anyone, and in fact if you see a friend with it in their hands, go ahead and burn their hands off.  You would be doing them a favor and hopefully the infection will not spread.<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****</p></body></html>

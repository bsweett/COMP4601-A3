<meta name="summary" content="A "Give Your Brain a Rest" sci fi movie that is just fun to watch"></head><body><p>I always have to chuckle when folks watch science FICTION movies for scientific accuracy.  Remember, in the genre type, science is the adjective and fiction is the noun.  I am an engineer by education, a dedicated amateur astronomer, and a huge sci fi fan.  Almost 20% of my extensive home video library is catagorized as sci fi.  I don't watch sci fi movies for scientific accuracy; I watch them for entertaining creativity.  All sci fi movies take a kernal of scientific knowledge, add a little social spice, then creatively extrapolate the recipe to the ridiculous while presenting the theme as realistically plausible.  The Core is no different.  It is just a fun movie to watch. The cast worked well together with contrasting personalities.  The core seeking sub was creatively designed but unfortunately constructed out of a silly named material.  Finally, like most sci fi movies, shows, and many novels, the end wraps up a little too quickly, but The Core is still a fun science FICTION movie to watch.</p></body></html>

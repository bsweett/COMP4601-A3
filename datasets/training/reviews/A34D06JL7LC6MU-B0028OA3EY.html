<meta name="summary" content="Superman Returns"></head><body><p>I've never been a real big fan of comic books and have never seen a single Superman movie (although I did see that series with Dean Cain a couple times). I am familiar with Superman and, from what I can tell, this film is pretty good. It's not perfect (it's definitely way too long), but it's good, entertaining, and has some great special effects. The film is directed by Bryan Singer, who left the "X-Men" series to do this film and stars newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The movie opens with a title card that tells us that Superman disappeared for five years to explore his extinct planet Krypton. When he returns, he resumes his job at The Daily Planet under the alias Clark Kent but finds that things have changed. His love Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth, 'Beyond the Sea') has a young son, Jason, and is engaged to the editor Richard (James Marsden, 'X-Men: The Last Stand'). Meanwhile, the evil and bald Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey, 'American Beauty') has come up with a money-hungry plan for world domination...As Clark adjusts to his new life and returns to his role as Superman, Luthor discovers a way of getting lots of money AND killing Superman. Now, here are a couple problems with the movie. First, Lex Luthor's plan is idiotic...Although, that's usually the case with movie villains whether they're in a Superman movie or a James Bond movie. It's way too long...It's never dull and my favorite movie of all time has the same running time as this film, but it could've been trimmed. Bosworth's Lois Lane isn't incredibly likeable and Bosworth isn't really credible as a mother. But with the cons come the pros. Routh makes a credible Superman and the fact that he's an unknown makes it a lot more believable, because you're not thinking to yourself the entire time "That's Brandon Routh!" People have complained about Kevin Spacey's performance as Lex Luthor, because it's campy. And, yes, it is campy...But I think it works better this way. If he had played it straight, there would be no fun in it and with the plan Luthor has in the movie, campiness is the best choice. The movie co-stars<br /><br />Frank Langella, Eva Marie Saint (as Clark's mother), Parker Posey (as Kitty, Luthor's girlfriend),<br /><br />and Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Superman's dad. There's a fascinating Bonus Feature on the 2nd disc, detailing how they digitally recreated Brando's role from the original and placed it in this film.<br /><br />Posey is wonderful as Luthor's girlfriend, camping it up herself yet holding her ground against Spacey. Whenever there's a movie based on a comic book, people tend to lash out at the director.<br /><br />Bryan Singer has taken a lot of heat, from the beginning of the "X-Men" trilogy to this film. I got to say, the dude is doing a pretty good job. Could someone better have directed this movie? Probably, but I wouldn't know who. "Superman Returns" should please fans of the comic book or just the casual viewer, despite its shortcomings. It's worth watching, at least once.<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></body></html>

Good job casting and directing and production is amazing. Sets and costumes will take you from 1960s to 1990s. Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe give stand out performances as a gangster and a clean cop. You will see Denzel's character rise from a driver that respects his boss to an all powerful leader. You will see as he goes from twenty thousand to over two-hundred and fifty million. He brings his large family from South Carolina and sets them all up in the business. Although it may seem a little long in parts it is a good drama. If you enjoy movies like "The Godfather" or "Donnie Brasco", you will probably enjoy this movie. Good quality DVD with decent replayability.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="60 Minutes"></head><body><p>Having been on earth for just more than six decades, I feel qualified in saying that the remake of this Sci-Fi classic is definitely the day the movie theatres stood still.  I was 2...that's right, 2, when the 1951 classic TDTESS was released starring Michael Dennie and Patricia Neal...in black and white (of course).  The 2008 remake stars Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly, a handsome and beautiful duo that have earned Academy recognition through the years.  Stick to the 1951 classic.  This one has all the millennium effects, sound and dull script, but it would have been much better if it had been condensed to a 60-minute remake on cable (like Masters of Horror).  This was a yawner...had its moments...and the only saving grace was the beautiful countenance of Jennifer...she is just filled with natural beauty but she is much better cast in other films.  I have to give 3 stars because of the casting and special effects.  Cut this baby to 60 minutes and you have a winner.</p></body></html>

Although tied to the Alien films, "Prometheus" is creepy and suspenseful but doesn't dwell in the high-octane gore of the original films -- it's there, but it's not the whole point of the film.  Instead, big concepts about the conquest of space, cosmic seeding and the spiritual yearnings of aliens, androids and man are probed and examined, and many big questions are left dangling, tantalizingly in need of further exploration. I can't remember a recent movie I've wanted a sequel of more than this one - I'm itching to see what happens next!<br /><br />In addition to the direction and special effects, the acting is also pretty good. I did not care much for the pair of lead actors Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green (the scientists behind the expedition) although Charlize Theron is fine as their unlikable corporate minder, and Idris Alba is fun as the noble spaceship captain (with major props to the supporting actors who played his crew...) The breakaway star of this show, though, is the steely-eyed Michael Fassbender, who plays David, the film's obligatory android, who is a spine-tingling combination of 2001's HAL and Star Trek's Data, one of the best portrayals of an AI being you'll ever see. Truly delicious. The aliens look cool, too.<br /><br />Bravo for Ridley Scott, who is back in the saddle again... Hopefully the studios will be smart and keep him at the helm for the planned sequels... Can't wait until they're out! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)</p></body></html>

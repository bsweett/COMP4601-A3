<meta name="summary" content="I was taken aback by how much I really enjoyed this movie..."></head><body><p>This review might seem a little contradictory to anyone who recently read my `Quantum of Solace' review.  These two films are virtually the same movie (not plot wise, but in the idea that they are all action, very little character development) and yet I'm giving this one an extra star.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Well, as anyone who has read my review of `Quantum of Solace' knows, I expected a lot more out of that film.  In fact, `Taken' delivers exactly what I expected it to, and in some areas even more; yet, while `Quantum of Solace' basically offers me the same thing it fails to live up to the hype spilling over from `Casino Royale'.<br /><br />`Taken' tells of a former spy Bryan Mills who has given up his former life in order to try and regain a relationship with his teenage daughter Kim.  His ex-wife Lenore makes that extremely difficult by constantly degrading him and purposefully keeping him out of reach of his little girl (well, not so little anymore).  When his daughter wishes to go to Paris with a girlfriend Bryan feels it is a mistake, but under immense pressure from Lenore he gives in and allows Kim to go only to regret the decision almost immediately when his daughter is kidnapped in order to be sold into prostitution.  Bryan then embarks on a mission of his own to track down and kill the men responsible for this crime and rescue his daughter.<br /><br />The film is brisk and exciting and always engaging; filled with one action scene after another.  While this is nothing special or extraordinary, it never lets one down.  The thing about `Taken' is that it actually delivers what it promises.  No one going into this is expecting a drawn out character study, and while they know that Bryan is worried about his daughter they are not expecting a father/daughter bonding film.  They are expecting things to blow up, people to get shot and their attention to be kept.<br /><br />`Taken' delivers on all fronts.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is a surprisingly adept action star (he should do more films like this one) and he carries this film from beginning to end.  He is intriguing, attractive and heroic; all the qualities needed to make a film like this work.<br /><br />In fact, `Taken' is so good at what it does that I was tempted to give it an A, if not for the last three minutes or so.  Yes, an action film that for once appeared virtually flawless falls to ridiculous pieces right before the final credits begin to roll.  I won't spoil the films ending for you here, but I will say that it is not what happens but how it happens that upset me.  The film had a real sense of gritty realism, even if the majority of the action sequences were highly implausible.  The thing is, the films handling of the emotional reaction to this type of tragedy was beyond ridiculous and almost insulting.<br /><br />Like I said, it's the last three minutes.  Until that point, the film works wonderfully.<br /><br />So, I highly recommend this one despite the ending.  It is one tightly woven action film that delivers the thrills it promises and then some.  Liam is perfectly cast (and I was iffy about that one going in) and Pierre Morel's direction is impeccable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Excuse me, but who are those people living in your house?&quot;"></head><body><p>That's the question the exasperated Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) puts to an Interpol bigwig at the UN before the next shocking turn in Alfred Hitchcock's thrilling &quot;North by Northwest&quot;. A classic case of mistaken identity takes place when Mr. Van Dam's (James Mason's)henchmen pick up Thornhill by mistake, thinking him to be a superspy on their tail. Wonderful dialogue as Thornhill and Van Dam face off in a well-appointed LI mansion, before Thornhill is consigned to a near fatal attempt on his life by chief goon Leonard (an extremely young and thin Martin Landau).<p>There's no way I could possibly record all the twists and turn of this plot--and you wouldn't want me to either--but along the way, Thornhill does meet up with a surprisingly sexy Eva Marie Saint playing Eve Kendall, and he faces danger both in a cornfield and on Mount Rushmore before everything gets sorted out.<p>Cary Grant turns in one of his better late performances, and scampers around pretty well for a man in his 50s--a testament to his acrobat youth, no doubt. James Mason is always a delight to listen to, and Eva Marie Saint turns the voltage on high while being oh so subtle. And if you, like me, have a bit of an absurd sense of humor, do check out that furry chair in Van Dam's Mount Rushmore home--every time it's in a shot, I just burst out laughing!<p>Go &quot;North by Northwest&quot; for your next Hitchcock outing--you won't be disappointed!</p></body></html>

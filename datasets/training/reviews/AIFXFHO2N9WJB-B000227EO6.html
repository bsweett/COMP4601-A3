<meta name="summary" content="The Quest for Vengeance is Weakening..."></head><body><p>With the huge box office success and critical acclaim for "Kill Bill Volume 1", you can assume that expectations were extremely high for the final act in Quentin Tarentino's twisted tale of vengeance and mayhem, "Kill Bill Volume 2".  The big question surrounding the movie was, `Can the second film possibly live up to the first one, in terms of story and entertainment value, and as an overall movie?'  The answer is actually quite mixed.  But before I give you the reasons for why the response to the movie was so mixed, I will give you the basic plot synopsis for "Kill Bill Volume 2".<br /><br />Picking up directly where "Kill Bill Volume 1" left off, `The Bride' is continuing her bloody quest for vengeance on her former mentor and lover, Bill, and his team of twisted killers.  With "Kill Bill Volume 2", the training for `The Bride' (Uma Thurman), is explored to show the audience how she is capable of killing with such ruthless efficiency.  After dispatching her brand of justice to the majority of Bill's assassins, `The Bride' doesn't have very much farther to go before reaching her ultimate goal of killing Bill.  But, the road to Bill is plagued with misfortune, and `The Bride' is going to need to use all of her training to survive.<br /><br />Now that the plot synopsis is out of the way, I can get back to why response to "Kill Bill Volume 2" was less than stellar, when compared to the response to "Kill Bill Volume 1".  With "Kill Bill Volume 1" director and writer Quentin Tarentino delivered audiences a twisted tale of revenge, that was filled with plenty of violence, and not much in the way of exposition.  Whereas, in "Kill Bill Volume 2", the violence is toned down, almost to the point of non-existence in some cases, to make room for the exposition.  The problem here is that audiences were expecting the rest of `The Bride' killing off all of her former crew and her mentor, with maybe some exposition to fill in some more of the how's and why's of the whole thing.  Instead, what audiences got was basically the origin of `The Bride', how she learned to fight, her relationship with Bill, and how the whole thing went south on them.  Basically, Quentin let down his audience by setting the bar too high for himself with "Kill Bill Volume 1".  In my opinion, Quentin would have been better off to drop in some of the exposition from "Kill Bill Volume 2" into `Volume 1' and spread the action out better over the two films.  Had he done these two things, audiences probably would have responded better to "Kill Bill Volume 2", and both movies would have been equally entertaining.<br /><br />Although, personally I thought that neither film was all that great, but that's just me and I'm not that big of a Tarentino fan.  But overall, the two films are at least worth watching once.<br /><br />"Kill Bill Volume 2" is rated R for violence and language.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Michael Keaton is the best batman."></head><body><p>Batman directed by Tim Burton is a cool and classic action adventure. Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast as the Joker, his laugh is wickedly memorable. Kim Basinger is great as well, too bad she's always being typecast. I love Michael Keaton as Batman, he's funny, suspicious, and fits the role to a T. Buy this 1989 blockbuster today!</p></body></html>

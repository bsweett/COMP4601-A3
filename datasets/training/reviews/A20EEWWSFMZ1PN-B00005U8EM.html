<meta name="summary" content="This is a profoundly funny film"></head><body><p>Bill Murray has done many funny films "The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997)" and many profound films "The Razor's Edge" (1984). This film is profoundly funny. What would you do if you had all the time in the world? This movie covers just about everything you can think of.<br /><br />Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a conceited self-serving weatherman. He gets caught in a time warp while covering the Groundhog Day events. Everyday becomes Groundhog Day. After exhausting all the fun things you can do, he has time to confront himself and reflect on what is important.<br /><br />In "Joe Versus the Volcano" (1990) people relate that environment to where they work.<br /><br />Groundhog Day summed this up in one statement:<br /><br />Phil Connors asks, "What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?"<br /><br />Ralph answers, "That about sums it up for me."<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780618068">Michael ~ Andie MacDowell</a></p></body></html>

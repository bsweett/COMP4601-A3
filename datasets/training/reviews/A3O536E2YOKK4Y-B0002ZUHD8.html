Runtime: 142 minutes.<br /><br />"King Arthur" sheds the legend and theorizes the true story of the British leader of the late 5th and early 6th centuries, who led the defense of Britain against Germanic invaders (the Saxons) in the early 6th century as the Roman Empire was crumbling.<br /><br />This is Medieval-British Isle flick in the tradition of the three 1995 films "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX95">Braveheart</a>," "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079283366X">Rob Roy</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800141601">First Knight</a>," as well as 2006's totally underrated "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPFCPE">Tristan and Isolde (Widescreen Edition)</a>," which I feel is the best of the batch.<br /><br />"King Arthur" is my second favorite, followed by the underated "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00406UK7S">Centurion</a>" from 2010. "King Arthur" is visually gorgeous, shot mainly in Ireland, but also Wales and England. It has a good assortment of actors, including Clive Owen as Arthur, Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot, Keira Knightley as Guinevere, Ray Winstone as Bors, Stephen Dillane as Merlin and an outstanding performance by Stellan Skarsg?rd as the Saxon villain, Cerdic. Although I'm not a huge fan of Keira she certainly has a striking face, utilized to great effect in this film, and she looks awesome as a blue-painted Pictish warrior (i.e. a "Woad").<br /><br />The soundtrack is good and is sometimes reminiscent of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2WP7O">The Last of the Mohicans</a>" (1992), but blander and nowhere near as overpowering.<br /><br />The theme here, other than duty and war, is that of finding one's true home and calling. Many of us dream of "home" as some far-off place to find in the near or far future, but home may be closer than we think. We just need to be open and open our eyes. This reminds me of this story of a Texas minister who wanted to move to a place with small lakes & springs, etc. and the LORD told him it was ALREADY there on his property, he just had to use his imagination and create it. So he made some small lakes on his property with seven springs, as well as other modifications. Later, when his father was visiting, the subject of vacationing came up. His dad confessed that he enjoyed coming to his son's house rather than traveling elsewhere because it was so beautiful and peaceful that it felt like paradise. The minister learned a lesson: You might be sitting on your paradise (or "home") and just don't realize it. In short, quit looking for the greener grass somewhere else and simply open your eyes!<br /><br />FINAL WORD: I put off seeing "King Arthur" all these years for no particular reason and, after finally viewing it, I must say it's much different than what I expected. I expected another take on the legend like "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800141601">First Knight</a>" or "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305558167">Excalibur</a>" (not that those two films are in any way interchangeable), but "King Arthur" is totally different. It's got a unique story, full of savage Medieval action, but it also possesses an undeniable air of beauty and reverence with quite a few epic/dramatic moments.<br /><br />GRADE: B+ or A-</p></body></html>

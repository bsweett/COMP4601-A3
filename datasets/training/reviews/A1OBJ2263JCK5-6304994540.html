Everything from the suspenseful film noir &quot;Blood Simple&quot; to the hilarious &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot; But by far my favorite Film of thier's is the hippie, fever dream of a movie, known as &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;.&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is the Coen Brother's homage/spoof of the old Raymond Chandler detective novels.But instead of a tough gritty private eye we get an old burnt out hippie (known as The Dude) who has a passion for interleague bowling.The poor guy gets drawn into a convoluted mystery when his rug is soiled (&quot;the rug tied up the entire room, man&quot;) and he is mistaken for a millionaire named Lebowski.From that moment on the Dude goes through a crazy quilt of a city known as Los Angeles encountering every weirdo that the full moon can bring out (feminist artists, pornographers, a gang of nihilist Germans etc.)Actor Jeff Bridges is wonderful as the Dude. Nobody seems to want to leave this poor guy alone! He is thrown into a mystery when all he wants to do is bowl and get stoned! Special mention should be made of actor John Goodman, who plays the Dude's totally obnoxious, Vietnam obsessed, buddy.Goodman practically steals the film as he rants and raves and keeps getting the Dude into deeper and deeper trouble.Everything in this film is well done including a smart script, inventive set design, phantasmagoric, dream-like, special effects and a wonderful soundtract that includes Bob Dylan, Ry Cooder, CCR and the Gypsy Kings.This movie is dead on funny and will leave you laughing even after multiple viewings.Buy this movie!</p></body></html>

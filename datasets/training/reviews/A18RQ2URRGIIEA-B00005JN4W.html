Beginning several decades earlier, the story begins in an age when many superheroes were saving lives and stopping criminals and were highly respected by law enforcement and the general public.  However, this thankful climate changed when people who had been injured began to sue the superheroes for injuries incurred during one their attempts at rescuing.  Three such superheroes were Mr. Incredible (a.k.a. Bob Parr; voice of Craig T. Nelson), his wife Elastica (a.k.a. Helen Parr, voice of Holly Hunter) and Frozone (a.k.a. Lucius Best, voice of Samuel L. Jackson).  To stop the numerous lawsuits and damage, the government decided to force all of the superheroes into retirement and to place them into a program to keep them hidden.  Of course, they were not permitted to use their superpowers anymore, even though that is exactly what they all wanted to do.  After many years, Bob & Helen Parr had three children: the oldest a daughter named Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), the next oldest a son named Dashiell 'Dash' (voice of Spencer Fox) and the youngest a baby named Jack Jack (voices of Eli Fucile and Maeve Andrews).  The Parr family does its best to live normal lives, but Bob is really miserable in his job, especially because of his very unpleasant boss.  He yearns to relive the good old days of saving people and one night, while he and Lucius are looking for someone to save while listening to a police scanner in a car, they are being watched.  The person watching them is a woman named Mirage (voice of Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a), who works for a mysterious man named Syndrome (voice of Jason Lee).  She offers Bob a chance to use his abilities as Mr. Incredible and to be paid handsomely for it, but there may be an ulterior motive.  Another fun character is the superhero costume designer named Edna 'E' Mode (voice of Brad Bird).<br /><br />The quality of animation used by Pixar in creating "The Incredibles" is some of their most realistic work to date.  It is no wonder that "The Incredibles" won the Oscars for Best Animated Film and Best Sound Editing, and received Oscar nominations for Best Achievement in Sound and Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.  The film's story was one of the best that Pixar has ever produced (ranking right up there with "Finding Nemo" from 2003), and I wholeheartedly recommend it.  Overall, I rate it with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  Many thanks go to the numerous people that helped to create the film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Reasonable Vampre/Werewolf Flick, but Lacks Originality"></head><body><p>"Underworld" has two great things in it; beautiful images and elegant Kate Beckinsale.  Period.  Except for them, you get nothing particularly special about it -- the actions are not new, the acting is not good, and most of all the story is very slow-moving and uninvolving.  <p>"Underworld" is, some say, the Romeo and Juliet story in vimpire/werewolf version.  This account is quite misleading.  It is about Ms Beckinsale's Selene, deadly assassin with guns among the vampire clan.  They are fighting the bloody war so long with the now-outnumbered werewolves (Lycans, they are called), so no one remembers the original cause of the war.  So, Selene is told to kill, and she kills.  So far so good.  <p>And the opening subway gun-shooting scenes are reasonably done.  And Scott Speedman's doctor named Michael enters as the possible target of the Lycans.  Selene only seems aware of the fact that Michael has some secret he doesn't know, but the leader of the Lycans (Michael Sheen) is desperately after.  Now the plot is going to thicken.<p>But it doesn't.  Soon we get confused because of the very clumsy storytelling, i.e. talk, talk, talk, which includes many monologues, intricate relations of characters, and some ritualsa and traditions about the dynasty of old, sleeping vampires.  Some are intrigued by these webs of facts, but I must say ... Isn't this supposed to be Romeo and Juliet?<p>The director Len Wiseman unaccountably doesn't show any interest in the relations between Beckinsale and Speedman.  This misguided choice kills any potential power they might have been given; instead, we start to lose interest in them.  How should we care these uninteresting characters?<p>If you have seen "Blade" "Blade 2" or the first "Crow", don't expect the actions, which lack originality.  Not that they are bad -- far from it.  But the fact remains that we have seen more exciting and unique ones in them, and to make matters worse, for all the inclusion of creature designer Patrick Tatopoulos, the werewolves are not convincing.<p>We got good production designs including the cobbled streets of Budapest; we got credible and often very sinister atomospher.  Still we need more power, or elegance, or humor, or anything here, which might heighten the tension between the two clans.  We need danger, and only in danger Beckinsale's death dealer starts to shine.</p></body></html>

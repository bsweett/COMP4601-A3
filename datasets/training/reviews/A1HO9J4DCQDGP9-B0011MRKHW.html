<meta name="summary" content="A breathtaking film worth going to the movies to see!"></head><body><p>As many other reviewers have said, this movie pretty much takes off where <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RF7XYO">Elizabeth (Spotlight Series)</a> left off, however now she is no longer a Queen in waiting but a powerful monarch who has the unsavoury task of keeping Spain from invading her shores, as well as fending off attempts to get her to marry, for a woman such as Elizabeth would not be willing to share power with the man who might be King.<br /><br />As to this melting pot unrequited love, wonderful scenes from history, who can forget Raleight and the cloak over the puddles scene, as well as murder, treason and intrigue, don't forget Mary Queen of Scots here, and of course Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's right hand man and Britain's first true spymaster and you have a film that totally takes your breath away.<br /><br />Forget the fact that historically there are probably more holes in it than a Swiss Cheese, the movie follows the spirit of the era in my opinion and is worth seeing just for the quality acting from Cate Blanchett as the passionate Elizabeth, Geoffry Rush as the deadly Walsingham, and the lovely Samantha Morton as the doomed Mary Queen of Scots, along with sumptious constumes, a great soundtrack, some nifty special effects.<br /><br />I liked this film, it is as good if not better than the film Elizabeth and its a real shame it has not been nominated for more Oscars, certainly it deserved it considering what did get nominated this year!</p></body></html>

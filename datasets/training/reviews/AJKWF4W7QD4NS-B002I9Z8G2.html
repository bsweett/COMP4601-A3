<meta name="summary" content="The best Trek film to feature the Next Generation crew"></head><body><p>Even numbered Trek films are known to be better, and this eighth installment isn't an exception.  Jonathan Frakes makes his feature film directorial debut here which finds Captain Picard and crew journeying back in time to stop the Borg from altering history and assimilating Earth.  Patrick Stewart gives his best performance as Picard ever, while Alice Krige is both seductive and terrifying as the Borg Queen.  The special effects are top notch, and the Borg look scarier and more grotesque than they ever have before.  This is undoubtadly the best Trek film to feature the Next Generation crew, and Frakes' nice balance of humor, action, suspense, and horror make Star Trek: First Contact one of the best films in the series.  Even though the DVD itself is in desperate need of being re-released with extras worthy of the film, the picture and audio quality is unbelieveably top notch and looks and sounds great on home theater systems.</p></body></html>

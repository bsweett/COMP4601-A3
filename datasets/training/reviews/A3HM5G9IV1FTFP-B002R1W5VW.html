<meta name="summary" content="Good film, lukewarm ending"></head><body><p>I was totally digging this film until the very end. It was well written and well directed (I mean, it's Ridley Scott, he's terrific). Nicholas Cage excells at playing neurotic, oddball characters like OCD-inflicted con-artist Roy, Alison Lohman was adorable and conniving as Angela, and Sam Rockwell was charming and smarmy as Roy's partner-in-crime. The relationship between Roy and Angela was endearing and interesting, and although the "twists" in the film's plot were really no surprise, they still worked pretty well. I just didn't buy Roy's compete moral 180 at the end of the film. I just don't think a person who's spent his life getting rich on the wrong side of the law would really be willing to give it all up for the life Roy chooses at the end of the film.<br /><br />But who knows? Maybe I'm just cynical.</p></body></html>

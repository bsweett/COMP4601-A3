<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's Final Film"></head><body><p>Stanley Kubrick was never known for a being a director whose films instantly catered to the masses.  Even popular films like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and THE SHINING generated tons and tons of controversy over their meaning, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE shocked people with its elliptical approach to violence.  Kubrick's last film, EYES WIDE SHUT, released three and a half months after his untimely death in 1999, held true to form.  There is no unanimity.  In my opinion, however, this kind of debate makes for a great film.  On that score alone, that makes EYES WIDE SHUT a masterpiece.<p>Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman star in this disturbing psychosexual drama about an upscale Manhattan couple--Kidman a typical housewife, Cruise a good doctor--who become torn over conflicting views of love and sex after Kidman spots her husband playing up to a pair of models at a party held by a good friend (Sydney Pollack).  And when Cruise is called out late one night to comfort the wife of a client who has just died, he will soon find out not only how thin the line between men and women really is, but also how blurry the difference is between dreams and reality...<p><p>Collaborating on the screenplay with Frederick Raphael, which was inspired by Arthur Schnitzler's 1920s novel "Traumnovelle", Kubrick turns and twists EYES WIDE SHUT into something extraordinarily complex, something that cannot be understood with just one simple viewing.  Like all of his films before it, EYES WIDE SHUT must be seen more than once to get the full impact.  Even then, it is extremely ambiguous and deceptive, forcing the viewer to analyze in his or her mind what the exact nature of dreams really are.<p>This kind of ambiguity and the very fluid shots and Kubrick's handling of the dialogue, much closer in tone to the way real people talk, makes for a film that is incredibly long (at 159 minutes) and, for some rather boring.  But Kubrick's films have never been typical Hollywood fare anyway, and in fact have often been hugely influential on other directors (Spielberg, DePalma, Scorsese, etc.).  In the end, EYES WIDE SHUT was a typical way for Kubrick to depart this world--to leave us with yet another film of his to be debating as the years and decades go by.</p></body></html>

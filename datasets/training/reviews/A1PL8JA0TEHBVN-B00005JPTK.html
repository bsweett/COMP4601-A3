<meta name="summary" content="This is a great film, great DVD... and so much more!!"></head><body><p>Obviously things are a matter of taste. Some people love it, some people hate it, other just don't care.<br /><br />There is something deliciously horrible to watch our cities being destroyed in the movies. It is like a guilty pleasure. Some uncontrollable curiosity that leaves us in awe before the unusual. It may be looking at a car accident as we drive by or watching New York City being destroyed by the sea in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002V7OI8">Deep Impact (Special Collector's Edition)</a>, by a monster in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPXY">Cloverfield [Theatrical Release</a>] or by the ultimate storm in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007PALRU">The Day After Tomorrow (Two-Disc All-Access Collector's Edition)</a>. It is a pleasure to see the impossible happen with the visual accuracy of certainty while deep inside we know it only lasts for two hours.<br /><br />I AM LEGEND gives you that guilty pleasure... with a twist: the city is not really destroyed. It is Humans who are absent after a deadly disease has wiped us out. And after that, Nature starts to reclaim the Earth. In fact, one of the most powerful images of this film is in the beginning, when Dr. Neville (Smith) drives a Mustang across the city and gets surprised by deers running scared through the streets on Manhattan. Even more disturbing is to see Dr. Neville moving across the woods in Times Square (no less) as he hunts one of them.<br /><br />This is just one of I AM LEGEND's greatest achievements: it really gives us a world (through state-of-the-art visual effects) unseen, unimaginable, fascinating... and lets you explore it. We know there are vampires (or some creatures like that running havoc through the night). But during daytime, we go places and see things we'll never see. And that's pure film magic.<br /><br />So here is the story: Dr. Robert Neville lives alone in Manhattan as the sole survivor to a deadly virus (to which he is immune) who transformed everybody in light-sensitive vampire-like monsters (forced to live in the dark). The crisis (shown in flashbacks as he recollects) happened a few years ago and - right now - Dr. Neville is on the verge of loosing his mind. He talks to mannequins, watches recorded television broadcast and try to have a normal life (with his dog Samantha) hoping to make contact with other survivors like himself. Oh... and he is a military scientist trying to find a cure.<br /><br />Now... it is a ridiculous effort to compare the film to the book, as this film is much more a loose adaptation of Richard Matheson's great novella. This film uses the same premise but makes significant changes in key elements that (I believe) would never really work on a Hollywood blockbuster. So, those who love the novella and hate the film should realize that, many many times, the film's preoccupations and objectives are not the same ones we have on the books they are based on. It is important to appreciate the film in its own merit and outside the burden of the book - a burden any film wants to break free from. Gone are the days where a Hollywood film "wanted to be the book" because they needed such blessing from such an authority.<br /><br />And breaking down the film's great assets, we'll find only positive elements: Will Smith's very precise performance, a screenplay who tell you the story minute by minute maintaining you always wanting more, great special effects, great scary moments that will please its target audience... and the city we love being engulfed by a destiny without us.<br /><br />Simply beautiful.<br /><br />This DVD version comes with lots of extras, the best of which, in my opinion, is the making of the city's visuals we see throughout the entire movie. Also, it comes with an alternate version of the film with a different ending that would never hit the audience in the same way. Fascinating.<br /><br />The film is not perfect. There are one or two less interesting elements that I will not delve into because I believe they are a matter of taste. And regardless of that, I think this film is a production triumph in contemporary cinema.<br /><br />That's it.</p></body></html>

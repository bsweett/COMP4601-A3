<meta name="summary" content="Johnny Depp was great, but?"></head><body><p>I must have dozed. I lost track how the heart got out of the closed jar. If Davey Jones couldn't set foot on land, why would he keep his heart locked in a chest on dry land?  A few of the stunts were good. The sword fight on the water wheel was creative. The main problem was that the plot was lame. Frantic action does not make up for a thin story line. Orlando Bloom was captured so often it defies imagination. Depp was good. It was a typical bad sequel. The producers must have thought more stunts, uglier monsters, and more danger would be better, but it wasn't. They lost most of the charm and the humor. I was just bored and then it was opened ended so they can have another sequel. They should have stopped with just one.</p></body></html>

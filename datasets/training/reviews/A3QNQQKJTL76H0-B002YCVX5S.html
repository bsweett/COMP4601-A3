<meta name="summary" content="Quintessentially Tarantino, but could've been much better"></head><body><p>Being a fan of previous Tarantino works (mainly Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown), WWII combat films and westerns, I expected to like Basterds a lot more than I did. As you already know from trailers and ads, the film is a lavishly-produced and violent revenge fantasy centered around a plot to take out the Nazi High Command. Basterds has the look of film-making of yesteryear, drawing inspiration and stylistic influences from such sources as the classic 1967 film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O176IO">The Dirty Dozen</a>, spaghetti westerns and "macaroni combat" films (a sub-genre of films produced by Italian directors of the mid-60's). Like all Tarantino films, it is filled with wonderfully inventive, humorous (and sometimes rambling) dialog, quirky narrative pacing, and a cast of memorable characters. And of course, lots of hidden references and punctuated by great music.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen the film, there are actually two main story branches: the more publicized one concerning the Basterds, and another revolving around a young Jewish woman named Shoshana who is living in Paris under an assumed name and identity. Her story comes first. In Chapter 1, we are introduced to the film's main antagonist, a charming, highly intelligent, and charismatic SS Colonel named Hans Landa, nicknamed "The Jew Hunter" for his ruthless efficiency. He visits a French farmhouse where a teenage Shoshana and her family are being hidden. Shoshana is the only survivor of that encounter. She flees, but with a clear opportunity to kill her, Landa lets her escape.<br /><br />Next, we cut to Chapter 2 where we see Lt. Aldo Raine (played by a miscast Brad Pitt) recruiting a unit of Jewish American soldiers to engage in guerrilla operations deep within Axis-controlled France, spreading terror through the Nazi ranks with their ambush tactics and brutality. We see them clubbing Nazi soldiers to death with baseball bats and taking of scalp, shown very graphically. Pitt's performance and mannerisms as a hardened military man from Tennessee (complete with Southern drawl) is not completely convincing, reminding me of his character from 12 Monkeys instead. My major criticism here is with the character development. It's very lacking, in my opinion. We only get a brief vignette/flashback of Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), called out by name in a 60's movie font. We don't get much of a backstory for Aldo or any of the other 7 basterds except Stiglitz, giving us very little emotional investment. Not all of them make it through the film.<br /><br />Next, we have the British coming into play, hatching up "Operation Kino" (German for "cinema"), a joint operation with the Basterds to blow up a movie theater where Hitler and his top commanders will be attending a film screening of Joseph Goebbels' newest propaganda film. Mike Meyers makes a cameo appearance as a British General, sounding a bit like Austin Powers with his fake accent. Unknown to the Allies, Shoshana hatches a plot of her own and we return to her in the fifth and final chapter as she sets her plans in motion and the remaining parties converging for a final fateful encounter, all set to David Bowie's bellowing "Putting Out Fire" (a song originally written for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000069HZO">Cat People</a>). It's wonderfully anachronistic and appropriate, as is almost all of the musical choice in the film, which blends rock riffs, Spanish guitar, and too many styles for me to identify.<br /><br />Austrian actor Christoph Waltz is absolutely brilliant as Landa and is expected to get an Oscar tap for his command performance. Cold, calculating, beguilingly charming, and nuanced, Tarantino says Landa is perhaps his greatest character. Waltz infuses the character with complexity, humor, and wit. He really makes this movie.<br /><br />Stylistically, the film is beautiful shot, visually convincing, and full of that trademark Tarantino flare. It's a very enjoyable experience if you like his work and WWII films in general, but I felt Pitt was miscast and not totally believable in his role. The basterds needed more character development if we are to care about their fates. We get very little personality information to go on here, and the film treated them as expendables. Even if the army did, the film shouldn't have treated them as disposables if we are to make a two and a half hour investment in watching this film and in the characters. Overall, I enjoyed this film, but it could've been better.</p></body></html>

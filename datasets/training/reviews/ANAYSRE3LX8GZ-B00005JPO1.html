<meta name="summary" content="Over the top Indy"></head><body><p>George Lucas and Steven Spielberg team up once again for the 4th installment of Indiana Jones.<br /><br />As expected, they have gone overboard with the CGI, however... you may feel that aliens and telekinesis powers and zombies are just too unrealistic for the Indiana Jones franchise, but then again, I suppose a fictional holey grail, and ancients who rip hearts out was over the top too, so Indiana Jones has never been on the non-fiction side of the real world.<br /><br />I did not like this one as much as the 1st and 3rd Indy, but it's better then the second one for sure.<br /><br />Indy is back, 20 years after the last movie, his father and Marcus have died. But his girl is back, and he has a son this time. Indy is first brought to Area 51 in 1950 something, and he is to help the bad guys find an alien skull that is made of crystal and magnetic. Then the rest of the movie is him escaping them, the FBI and trying to return this skull to it's rightful place.<br /><br />I guess Spielberg and Lucas decided to blend some of there old movies together, some felt like American Graffiti mixed with Close Encounters meets the X-Files.<br /><br />Overall, if you go in not expecting it to top the last movie, then it is kind of a fun ride. Just remember to suspend belief in reality, and the movie is ok.<br /><br />It just seemed some things where rather rushed, and not expanded upon, tho, maybe they cut out a lot of scenes. So it will be interesting to see the deleted scenes when this comes out. Provided they release a proper edition when they release it on DVD and not release a single disc, then a special edition later, then a gold edition, then the 2 year anniversary edition etc..<br /><br />Just watch it in expecting to see something very different from previous films a long with a little of the old Indy feel mixed in.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Suspiria"></head><body><p>Genuine chills and gore aplenty from shock-meister Dario Argento, "Suspiria" is anything but subtle, with some obvious dubbing work likely to cause some opening nervous chuckles. But you won't be laughing for long, as initial eeriness quickly segues to scenes of sheer terror. Not recommended for kids.  An ideal Halloween movie.</p></body></html>

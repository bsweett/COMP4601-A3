<meta name="summary" content="A stirring movie with a good soundtrack"></head><body><p>If you normally skip "indie" films, see this one. You will be glad you did. This movie is story driven and you want to follow it to the end. It is hard to believe that Zach Braff wrote, directed and stared in this film. Why is he wasting his time on TV? The writing is top notch, acting superb and photography well done.<br /><br />Zach Braff comes home for his mother's funeral after years of being away. Of course coming home brings up all the reasons he left and never returned before. And he has to deal with and resolve these problems. That is both perceived and real. His portrayal of going home and meeting old friends and family seem very realistic to me.<br /><br />Eventually we have the ever-beautiful Natalie Portman enter into his life and she starts to accompany him during his last days with his friends of his youth. Her character as well as some quirks she needs to work through.<br /><br />The characters in this movie have their own unique ways about them. And get just enough screen time to fill out the story line and seem real. The movie takes us through a range of emotions. And yet there are a couple of classic scenes that you will find yourself laughing at.<br /><br />The soundtrack of this film is as enjoyable as watching the film was. A mix of golden oldies and fresh indie-pop, this is a mellow sweet collection. The sound track stands on its own merit. But the beautiful music of "Garden State's" soundtrack serves as a poignant reminder of the movie.<br /><br />Unlike other's who have written bad reviews I think that this quirky movie stands on its own and is worth seeing. Watch it with a date.</p></body></html>

In fact there ultimatly is no substance whatsoever that I could find. A dull parade of special effects wrapped around over acting and pure juvenile silliness. Hugh Jackman is great in the X-Men movies but he should have left this script out on the back porch and let the sun eat away at the pages, come to think of it that would probably have made a better movie than Van Helsing turned out to be.</p></body></html>

There are some ridiculous leaps in logic and non-sensical developments to be found, but as a whole, AvP:R is a nasty, bloody, and unabashedly R-rated treat that pays homage to the Alien and Predator franchises, and is much, much more entertaining than the AvP film that came before it (in fact, AvP:R more than makes up for the first mish-mash in the first ten minutes of the film).  Picking up where AvP left off, AvP:R finds the Predator ship crashing in a small Colorado town, where the hybrid Predalien and some facehuggers escape, and soon enough cause some bloody and gorey mayhem.  There's little in the way of character development, but the cast (including Rescue Me's Steven Pasquale, 24's Reiko Aylesworth, John Ortiz, and genre stalwart Robert Joy) is decent enough, and there are enough inventive ideas that don't show disrespect to either franchise, unlike what was seen in the first AvP.  Despite the flaws in the story, the Brothers Strause manage to conceive an entertaining and surprisingly good flick that works for what it is.  All in all, Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem isn't perfect, but it manages to provide most of the goods that fans looked for the first time around and didn't get.</p></body></html>

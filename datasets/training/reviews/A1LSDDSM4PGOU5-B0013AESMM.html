<meta name="summary" content="Terrific performances from Jodi Foster and Terrence Howard (4.5/5)"></head><body><p>this movie was much better than i had hoped or expected it to be.it<br />basically turns the vigilante genre on its head,and has a female<br />character as the vigilante.like any vigilante movie,it certainly poses<br />tough questions.it contains some terrific performances in it's two lead<br />characters,Jodi Foster as the vigilante,and Terrance Howard as the cop<br />on her trail.both are outstanding and very credible in their respective<br />roles.Foster really makes you sympathetic to her character and rooting<br />for her,even though you probably shouldn't.Howard's character is also<br />sympathetic,because he has mixed feelings,but has to follow the law.he<br />comes off very convincingly as someone who is conflicted.the movie is<br />well paced and appropriately dark.even before the end of the movie,i<br />thought it was well done,but the ending caught me totally off guard.it<br />elevated the movie a notch.for me,The Brave One is a 4.5/5</p></body></html>

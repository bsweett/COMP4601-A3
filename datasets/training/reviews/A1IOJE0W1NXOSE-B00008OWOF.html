<meta name="summary" content="Portrait of a con man"></head><body><p>This movie is based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., an infamous con man who successfully pretended to be an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer.  When his beloved parents divorced, he ran away from home and lived by his wits, eventually developing techniques which enabled him to impersonate a man who had the credentials for several different occupations and who was able to cash bad checks all over the world.  Leonardo DiCaprio turns in a smooth performance as Abagnale and he upstages Tom Hanks who is stuck in the role of a humorless FBI agent with a bad Boston accent.  My husband heard Abagnale speak 30 years ago, and remembers his life much the way it is depicted in the movie.  This is an enjoyable movie and an interesting look at a man who became whoever he wanted to be just by using his wits and charm.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Dead Silence" may make you scream!"></head><body><p>My 11-year-old daughter, already afraid of dolls, was pleasantly terrified while watching this old-fashioned thriller with a few twists, and so was the rest of my family.<br /><br />As with many of my reviews these days, I will not get into all the plot elements and details as they've been covered already in Amazon's comments and the other "Spotlight" reviews.  Therefore, I will, as is typical of me, focus on what I specifically liked and disliked about this minor classic and I really do think it will be considered one with time.<br /><br />This very tame "R" rated film is short on gore and long on atmosphere which are the kinds of horror flicks I like.  In addition, there are no sexually graphic scene either and as a father of two, I'm always glad when we can have a good scare together as a family and this film allows for that.  The only disappointment in this film for fans of this genre is that it's promoted as another <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AMWIVM">Saw</a>, which it is thankfully not.  If you can get past the intentional misleading by the marketers of this film, you will be in for a very pleasant 90 minutes of chills and memorable moments.  I can at least promise you that you will never look at a doll again without thinking of this flick.<br /><br />To start, the acting is actually first-rate which is another surprise for this genre and it has a number of familiar actors in it.  Next, the photography is that washed out blue filtering technique that gives the film a haunting look and it's especially notable when the flashes of color appear, mostly red, as in such films as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTX">Sin City</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCFO0I">Silent Hill</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OVLBGM">The Messengers</a>.  In addition, the script is clever and contains a rather terrific mystery that you really don't see coming, but it is a bit bogged down at times with some clich&eacute;-ridden and unbelievable moments like when our main character insists on driving all over the place with the evil looking dummy either in the back or front passenger seat when he could have been placed in his box or even a trash bag for that matter.  That is perhaps what held me back from giving this film 5 stars.<br /><br />The direction of the film is the heart of this film.  James Wan intentionally wanted a more atmospheric film and made an early decision to tone down the violence in favor of more memorable and creepy moments.  Even the actual murders are relatively tame, but still frightening (or I wouldn't let my 11 year-old see this).  The make-up work for the murders, corpses, and dolls are top-notch and again, not overly graphic, but very creepy and terrifying nevertheless.  In fact, haunting is the best term to use in relation to this story.<br /><br />"Dead Silence" is a throwback to a bygone era of film making wherein character development, atmosphere, and story provided the essence of the film without an over reliance on gore, sex, and violence.  As I've said before in other reviews, I'm no prude and enjoy my fair share of films that have those elements, but those elements and the sole reliance on those elements do not make a quality film.  "Dead Silence" is a haunting film that stays with you long after the experience of watching it is over and that makes it a quality film.  It is not a modern classic at this point by any means, but I think over time it will be considered a minor classic and will withstand the test of time as little dates this film.  I think it will be remembered much like we remember small films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004WGAA">Carnival of Souls and Horror Hotel</a>.  I like this film much like I like the recent Stephen King film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TJ6PBK">1408</a>, which is another haunting tale that relies more on the story, character development, and atmospheric direction than anything else.<br /><br />"Dead Silence" and "1408" may not leave you screaming, but they will have you up at night.  Pleasant dreams . . .</p></body></html>

I found the film uneven, laughing hysterically one moment and bored to tears the next. This could have been due to the thick accent by the lead characters in the film being hard to understand sometimes. It's smart, funny and gruesome, but it's too long and has some very unnecessary scenes that took it down a few pegs in my book. If you liked this film you may like 'You Kill Me' which I thought was a better film than this.</p></body></html>

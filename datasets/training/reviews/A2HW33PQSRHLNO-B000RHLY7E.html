<meta name="summary" content="An insult to 70's horror"></head><body><p>I'd like to open this review by admitting that "The Devil's Rejects" works as grade B trash, but not to the extent that Zombie would like--it doesn't have the depraved magic of "The Hills Have Eyes", Spinelli's "Maniac", or Craven's few gems before he became a corporate sellout.  Also, I find a great deal to admire in Rob Zombie's music and some of his comic book endeavors, but he just can't make movies.<br /><br />He's simply too mainstream now just to have fun, and as a result the genre is wee weed upon once again, people fancying this substanceless piece of sadism as "horror" or that it has anything to do with the films it shamelessly imitates.  Yeah, people get run over by trucks and fleshmasks are made, the three main characters are vile maniacs who seem to have popped out of nowhere, and Michael Berryman runs around, but a young Tobe Hooper did not make this movie.  Rob Zombie did.<br /><br />Zombie completely lacks originality; he tries too hard to alternate between the contemporary and the vintage ("Natural Born Killers" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" just don't mix)<br /><br />and the acting is so bad that it makes some Troma films look like Academy Award material.  Captain Spaulding, Otis and Baby aren't believable even on the pathological level.  All we get are three greasy pieces of trailer trash with a homicidal edge.<br /><br />And isn't it strange that none other than Rob Zombie should make the very first film in which I actually rooted for a cop.  Nothing Wydell does seemed remotely wrong to me dealing with these three specimens.  Even watching them die in the overextended, boring last scene was pleasant in a dull way.<br /><br />Why does a guy who is so refreshingly obsessed with horror in his music and elsewhere have to f**k things up like this?  Roger Ebert had the audacity to call this "a good example of the genre".  Maybe he has Alzheimer's (or just a particularly bad case of morbid obesity), but I guess he forgot about "The Innocents", "The Haunting", "The Omen", etc.  He's certainly old enough to have seen the quality as opposed to garbage like this.<br /><br />Zombie should stick to music.</p></body></html>

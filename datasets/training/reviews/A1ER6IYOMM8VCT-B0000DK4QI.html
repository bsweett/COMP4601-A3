<meta name="summary" content="A CLASSIC SCI-FI MONSTER GETS A FACE LIST! 4 1/2 STARS!"></head><body><p>Watching the 2 disc collector's edition of Predator I was amazed how well this film has held up! I think I liked it more now than when I saw it in a theater. This edition boast a nice DVD transfer and enough extras to keep me happy. Commentary, 'making of' with all the stars (old and new footage), deleted scenes, Predator profile, etc...etc. This is a tense good old fashioned Sci-Fi monster movie and there is a lot of restraint used as we don't get to see much of the 'Predator', until the memorable finale. The FX still look great and this has got to be one of the best creature designs in the last 20 or 30 years! I forgot how good a movie can look without any CGI in it!<br /><br />If the movie has any flaws, it's that there isn't any "real" depth to the characters, but it's an action Sci-Fi movie, so who cares. It's a lot of fun with a great monster and excellent pacing! Grab some popcorn and buy this 2 disc set!  It's out of this world........how cheesy can ya get! :-)</p></body></html>

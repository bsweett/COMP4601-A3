Still, I'm a hige fan of Alex Proyas, and I had to give it a shot. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Spooner (Will Smith) is a detective in 2035, when robots are commonplace. Spooner is not a big fan of robots despite, as we find out in the first scene, having had his life saved by one. He is called to U. S. Robotics, the company that manufactures all those robots, after Alfred Lanning (Babe's James Cromwell) plunges to his death from hundreds of feet above the building's lobby. Everyone else is convinced his death is a suicide-- but Spooner's not so sure. With the company poised to roll out its new line, CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) isn't thrilled with an anti-robot cop running around.<br /><br />The first thing you have to do with I, Robot is to divorce it from the source material. This is not Isaac Asimov's novel. (It probably would have been a good idea for them to put a different title on it.) In fact, it admits this, stating that the movie was "inspired by" the novel rather than based on it. So don't think of it as a bad adaptation of Asimov, or that's what you're going to get. The second thing you have to do with it is forgive it its relatively stupid climax and even stupider ending. Obviously, someone has a lot of his special effects budget left and didn't want to get less money for effects for his next film. That said, the effects are, in fact, pretty cool, and if you can switch your brain off when we get to the climax, you've got a chance.<br /><br />It's a shame you have to, though, because the first hour or so of the movie is a well-plotted, intelligent mystery flick. Sure, it's nothing special-- renegade cop who thinks he's onto the truth while everyone else thinks he's nuts-- but it's done with style and humor. And, of course, lots of special effects. This is a story that allows for exploration with effects, and Proyas takes advantage of that, much like he did in Dark City. The difference is that there, he managed to rein in the compulsion to descend into effects-mania that he shows here. (Perhaps the smaller budget helped.) When it comes right down to it, Proyas is a very good director, and this could have been a truly fantastic film. As it stands, it's not a bad film, but it didn't quite realize its potential. ***</p></body></html>

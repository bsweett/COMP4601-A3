And even if you were, you were probably so numb from it that then you may have considered this &quot;just another action flick&quot; when it was released. <p>Any serious action junkie has already seen this movie so 5* blah blah blah, you're going to watch it anyway. But I have this to say about the &quot;Vietnam Speech&quot; Rambo delivered at the end of the movie..... Maybe I've softened in the last 30 years, maybe I have a greater appreciation for the sacrifice of 50,000 young Americans lost in Vietnam - it doesnt matter, but I rank a 4 minute clip that I used to fastforward past now the singular highlight of the film. As great as Stallone was in those few short minutes, Richard Crenna deserved a Supporting Actor Oscar for his reaction to Rambo's heart rending speech.<p>This DVD collection is maybe the best on the market, particularly at the price. The restored video is sharp and crisp, and you have the choice between Widescreen and Standard. You can also select from DTS or 5.1 audio and either will completely blow you away. Who cares if the machine gun fire sounds hollow and unrealistic, you get the point anyway. 5 Grunts</p></body></html>

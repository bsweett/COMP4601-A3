<meta name="summary" content="Some Like It Lukewarm"></head><body><p>Let me preface my review by saying that Jack Lemmon was one of our greatest actors("The Apartment", "Glengarry Glen Ross",etc.), Tony Curtis was not the bad actor some people made him out to be("The Sweet Smell of Success","The Defiant Ones"), Billy Wilder was one of our great directors("Sunset Boulevard","Stalag 17",etc.)and Marilyn Monroe was one voluptuous babe.  That does not explain my mild amusement or indifference to this prohibition-era gender-bender or why the American Film Institute ranked this as the funniest comedy of all-time(?!).  Let's see bumbling musicians witness Saint Valentine's Day Massacre and go on the lam as girl musicians.  Hijinks ensue.  One of the musician's has to fend off the advances of a lech while the other pretends he's Cary Grant so he can make beautiful music with Marilyn Monroe.  I'm in hysterics.  If you want to see a better example of trans-gender comedy seek out or hope for the release on DVD of the classic early-eighties sitcom "Bosom Buddies" starring Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari.

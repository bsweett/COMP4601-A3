<meta name="summary" content="Why? Why when the Swedish version dubbed was already available???"></head><body><p>Watched all 3 Swedish "Girl" dubbed English and liked the series very much. Rented the American version out of curiousity. What??  Why was this film made?? If you want "Girl", do the Swedish version and skip this. Did not like tinkering done with end of this one either. Not recommended. Get the Swedish version.</p></body></html>

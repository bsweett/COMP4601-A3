<meta name="summary" content="Superb film with amazing shots - and an extra documentary on the making of the film"></head><body><p>This is a terrific movie.  I found it totally captivating as did my twelve year old son.  The title has a double meaning:  it refers to the month of March when the mating cycle of the Emperor Penguins begins and also to the long march this particular colony has to make to their mating ground.  Why do they have to travel such a distance to their colony?  Well, first you have to understand that this movie is about ONE colony, there are dozens of them all around the coat of Antarctica (I did some reading after the movie).  The cycle of mating, nurturing the egg, and raising the chick, takes months and months.  It begins in their fall (our spring) through their winter, spring, and into their summer.  During the spring and summer the ice melts towards their breeding ground.  They have to be at a place that remains safe for their chicks and in the summer the sea is only a few hundred yards from their breeding ground (which is convenient for the feeding of the always hungry and rapidly growing chick).<br /><br />The story of the way the couples choose each other, create and care for the fertilized egg, and that it requires both the male and female penguin and demands on them almost to the point of death is just amazing and strangely inspiring.  I guess because raising our young for more than twenty years requires a similar kind of dedication, but not as concentrated as the penguin couple's absolute focus over one brief season.<br /><br />The DCD also has a full length program on the making of the movie.  This is as fascinating as the movie in its own way.  The French filmmakers provide their own narration and at times their prose gets a bit much about how much they are sacrificing and so one.  While I take my hat off to them for giving a year in such awful conditions to get the footage, they did choose to do it.  But this documentary on the making of the film provides extra footage of the penguins that couldn't be in the G-rated version of the film and we get to see what they had to go through to get some of the amazing shots we see in the film.<br /><br />There is also a short program from National Geographic on the Emperor Penguins that is pretty good.  It is terribly marred by its childish quick cutting to add fake excitement of those with attention deficit disorder, and its constant harping about how global warming might impact the penguins and that we should all be up in arms about it.  As if the penguins haven't adapted to changes in climate over the past millions of years.  Give me a break.<br /><br />And finally, there is the delightful cartoon about Bugs Bunny trying to take an Ice-Show penguin who gets separated from his troupe back to the South Pole.<br /><br />This is a must have DVD and I recommend that everyone watch it and discuss it with their family and friends.  Just great.</p></body></html>

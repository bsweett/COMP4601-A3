<meta name="summary" content="Yes, it is guilty pleasure best watched at home. Agreed."></head><body><p>I have two responses to this film: an emotional one, and an intellectual one.<br /><br />My emotional response is that all of the actors played their roles with such convincing strength, and that the quality of direction was at such a high level that it was relatively easy to suspend disbelief (necessary in a film such as this). Even though many of the situations ? specifically the taboo situations ? were tired clich?-ridden retreads, my emotional responses to them were powerful. (During the film, that is. As I rethink them, I?m disgusted at myself for having powerful reactions to such tired retreads that offered no new explorations.)<br /><br />The concept of the film ? an exploration into how our choices affect the outcome of our lives ? is, if not an original concept, always an interesting one. This film is, essentially, a macrocosmic exploration of that question.<br /><br />Intellectually, however, my reaction is slightly different. We learn the likely reason for Evan?s blackouts as a child later in the film, but the explanation isn?t explored beyond that single connection. I consider that a considerable flaw, because when you start to piece each blackout with the supposed event that caused it, they don?t all add up. Moreover, much has been made of the quality of the drawing that Evan made as a seven year old. When we approach the end of the film, we understand what the painting represents. We also see that it wasn?t really a seven year old Evan that was drawing that. However, that disrupts the films prescribed timelines and organization as if nuclear fusion were occurring at its core. How could Evan, at that particular point in the film, possibly know what the sum total of his choices was going to be? Also, his father AND his grandfather possessed the same abilities as Evan? That?s a bit hard to swallow.<br /><br />Still, it was an interesting film to watch. Better than I thought, but not as good as it could have been.</p></body></html>

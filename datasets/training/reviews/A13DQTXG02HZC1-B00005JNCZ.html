During his journey with his buddy in the American continent, he saw much oppression and injustice.  One reviewer commented that this movie doesn't answer why Che decided to use violence when he could have used the non-violence approach as undertaken by Ghandi.  In fact, in a poignant scene as both buddies were at Macchu Picchu site, Che commented that a revolution without firepower wouldn't work.  He saw what the Spanish had done to the continent and perhaps, that conditioned him to take arms eventually.  I guess that a book is subject to open interpretations and the Director is intelligent enough not to hype up the myth that's Che and simply portrays Che as a man in this coming of age movie.  A profound and heart moving movie that shall be seen on the big screen.</p></body></html>

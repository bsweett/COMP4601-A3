Werner Herzog, 2005, 103 minutes, for The Discovery Channel) is a cautionary, spooky documentary that carries a spooky title. Here Herzog investigates the backstory of one Timothy Treadwell, a/k/a "The Grizzly Man", a well-known environmentalist kook who got himself (and his poor girlfriend Amy) eaten by a brown grizzly bear in Alaska on 5 October, 2003.<br /><br />"That bear was full of people and clothes," comments one interviewee - and it gave me shivers. Herzog's gentle, hissing German-accented narration heightens this story of a dishonest, mentally ill adventurer who began dreaming of being a bear and ended by willingly sacrificing himself to the one who killed him. Herzog praises Treadwell's spirit and work, respecting him to the point of disagreeing with his stance as a naturalist. Of course, Treadwell was a loser with apparently no brains at all.<br /><br />Treadwell (an adopted phony surname) was a native of Long Island, New York. A big, muscular and beautiful blonde, he obviously struggled with his gayness and simply could not live with it. At an early age he drank and drugged, eventually posing as an Australian orphan. Due to his silly accent and mental imbalance, no one ever believed him. He found himself reborn as a naturalist when he realized he could simply go out to Alaska, camp in the "wilderness" (the national park actually) and there commune with the real bears. This was a man who had cuddled teddy bears well into his young adulthood.<br /><br />"I always wished I was gay," Treadwell says in one of his rambling films, and in the space of two minutes says the word "gay" a dozen times. But he insisted how straight he was, and lived that way. Herzog encountered at least three women who clearly loved Treadwell. In turn, Treadwell essentially used them.<br /><br />In this newly invented life as an environmentalist, Treadwell would try to cuddle up to real bears. Running through women like socks, he managed to found Grizzly People, a conservationist group dedicated to the bears. The work and Treadwell's wildlife films may be laudable; Treadwell himself was not. He was a selfish, foolish idiot who began to believe more than anyone in this character he had created: the dedicated naturalist/activist. "The Kind Warrior", he called himself, while Herzog repeatedly comments that Treadwell was insane. "I have seen this [type of] madness on the film set," Herzog says of him.<br /><br />As usual, Herzog is thorough, he is fair, he is understanding - and he is taken with Treadwell's wildlife film footage. He speaks to everyone from the Alaskan locals who despised Treadwell to the women who allied themselves with Treadwell. Herzog interviews the medical examiner, who waxes poetic about the last minutes of Treadwell's life, and that of his intrepid girlfriend Amy. It is a harrowing story, and the examiner loses himself in the emotion of recounting Treadwell's final moments. Herzog later weeps, his back to the camera, as he listens to the audio of these moments which were captured in full. He tells Treadwell's former girlfriend and colleague, "You must never listen to this" and admonishes her to destroy the recording. No images exist because they had no time to remove the lens cap prior to the bear attack.<br /><br />It was simply an angry, half-starved bear who decided these two humans would be a good meal. "He got what he deserved," one local remarks to Herzog. After seeing the true toll of Treadwell's mental illness and his struggle against homosexuality, I was nauseated, fed up and exhausted. I do not know if you could stand the footage of Treadwell - and I am not sure whether the audio of his death is worse than seeing the film footage of his so-called life.<br /><br />Herzog always makes one think and retreat into oneself in a wonderful way. Here, he made me fully realize I have no respect for those who have no respect for nature. Perhaps that was Herzog's intention. Herzog says the universe is ruled by chaos and murder - something he says Treadwell ought to have understood but did not.<br /><br />Mr. Herzog, great genius of film and documentation, I disagree: the universe is ruled by STUPIDITY and the senseless death of Treadwell and Amy is the proof. Though I am addicted to Herzog's documentaries (see my review of the stunning <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037EAJA2">Encounters at the End of the World</a>), I will not be adding this one to my collection.<br /><br />Stupidity is stupidity, and even a cautionary documentary by Werner Herzog will not soften that hard truth.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Software Engineers, Watch This Movie"></head><body><p>Every Software Engineer (SE) should watch this. You will swear you are seeing your life on film. It is good enough to warrant 4 stars for the general public, but 5 stars for SEs. I put off seeing it for a long time because I had seen so many other office movies that were awful. This one was pretty good. The ending gets cut off rather abruptly and the outcome was not exactly what I would want -- which is why this movie is so true to life. The acting, the sets, everything is &quot;normal&quot;, but still done at a high production-quality level.</p></body></html>

Sure, it's fluffy. But boy oh boy is it fun to watch, and if there's a moral to this story, it's this: sometimes the best thing to do is to self-medicate.<br /><br />It is 2172 in the Republic of Libria, and the future's so bright we've *all* gotta wear shades---and take our Meds.<br /><br />But it's a fragile future: all citizens maintain a constant dose of the wonder drug Prozium, taken at regular intervals and available at Equilibrium distribution centers throughout the City. Prozium induces a perfectly level emotional state, flattening the mountains and filling the valleys. Prozium lets you cope, Citizen.<br /><br />It's your restroom break, and a jackbooted black-visored thug in full battle dress with a fully locked-and-loaded streetsweeper is gonna give you a little escort to the potty. Your reaction? No worries. Told to stomp puppies in the street or club baby harp seals to death? No worries.<br /><br />You get to spend most of your day gazing up at the huge, bloated, godlike head of Sean Pertwee ("Father", Equilibrium's economy-class rendition of Big Brother) blaring away at you 24/7. Your reaction? Hey man, it's cool.<br /><br />Yup: Prozium is a real wonder-drug. And if you miss your dosage? See those big guys in the leather trenchcoats with the black-visored helmets and the itchy trigger fingers?<br /><br />Of course, there is another way: go off the Prozium, quit cold turkey, begin to feel, start an art collection. Trouble is, government in the world of Equilibrium doesn't come calling with public donations to your arts foundation or underground symphony.<br /><br />They come with a Death Squad.<br /><br />They send in Society's ultimate weapon: the Disciples of the Tetragrammaton---the Grammaton Cleric. The Grammaton Clerics let the shock troops do all the initial wetwork and perimeter-securing, stride into the dark little warrens where you and your Picasso-loving rebel scum are hiding, show off their astounding Gunkata (a discipline where the adept wields his weapons in mathematically and geometrically precise sweeps and arcs designed to maximize carnage on the enemy and minimize damage to the Cleric. It's neat. Where do I sign up?), provide you with about 300 extra air-holes free of charge, and then pay you and your "Feelings" the ultimate compliment: they introduce a little napalm and chordite appliqu&eacute; to your bootleg copy of the Mona Lisa.<br /><br />That sounds pretty harsh, you might say. And I might say: consider the alternative: the brutal b*tch for humanity that was the 20th century. Father would back me up, citizen. Mankind nearly didn't survive. We made it through four World Wars, nuclear apocalypse, mass murder, environmental catastrophe, ecological collapse, mass genocide and ethnic cleansing, even 24-hour Jerry Springer episodes.<br /><br />Prozium is far better than the alternative. The problem starts when Grammaton Cleric Preston (Bale, who is so good he makes you cares despite the overall silliness) goes off his meds.<br /><br />Alright: first off, I was told "Equilibrium" was a mind-f*ck flick: much like the Matrix. I expected that Bale's character, once off the drug, would start realizing that something truly horrible was up---like, you know, when Rowdy Roddy Piper in "They Live" when Piper puts on the shades and realizes the yuppies are actually revolting outer-space monsters with meaty, veiny heads. Something like that.<br /><br />I thought maybe Bale would discover that Libria was ruled by giant carnivorous pink lemurs, or that the citizens of Libria were actually being forced to eat their own snot while Father took pictures and laughed.<br /><br />Nothing at all like that, I'm afraid. Bale wakes up, starts grooving on fine art and getting down with his erstwhile buddy Partridge(another great, grounded performance by Sean Bean)'s sudden interest in the poetry of Yeats, and starts to feel. You can probably connect the dots and fill in the plot from there.<br /><br />But that said, "Equilibrium"---which doesn't have an original bone in its sleek little body---entertains. Director Kurt Wimmer has certainly added something to the bubbling cauldron of cultural Cool with Gunkata: even if it's not a real martial art, it should be. I'd take lessons.<br /><br />The acting is the glue that holds the flick together: Bale is astonishingly good here and provides the movie with so much gravity that it seems more profound than it actually is. Good job! Sean Bean is equally excellent: the two make such a convincingly formidable duo that a `twist' 15 minutes into the film is actually compelling. I've never been a big Angus Macfadyen (Dupont; the actor was Robert the Bruce in "Braveheart") fan: he doesn't give me any reasons to start here. Maybe it's the weak chin and the pouty face.<br /><br />And the movie looks absolutely awesome: the firefights are great, the choreography is stunning, Kurt Wimmer keeps the pacing so tight that even as the wheels come off the wagon and the seams start showing, you're just so overloaded you don't notice. As for the film's big `message': is Utopia worth the emotional price?<br /><br />I don't know about that, and I don't know that I care. Things blowing up? Check! Christian Bale looking hip and sleek as he robs Neo's wardrobe? Check! Lots of wire-fu and gunkata-fu? Check and check! Hip white cadillac with white interior you get to drive if you make it through Grammaton Cleric training? Big check.<br /><br />Dose up on your Interval---or hey, go the cold turkey art-appreciation route and don't---and check "Equilibrium" out.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

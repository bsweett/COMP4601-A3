Audiences are more familiar with movies these days and you have to do MORE in order to entertain and to impress.<br /><br />I had heard a review or two say that Harrison Ford was losing his ability to sell an action film, but I strongly disagree. I thought he was very believable and proves that he is STILL one of the strongest movie actors around. In fact, all of the actors did a great job. Virgina Madsen, Paul Bettany, Carly Schroeder, Jimmy Bennett & Mary Lynn Rajskub from "24" were all solid.<br /><br />The movie, too, moved well. It held my interest but as my review title suggests: there was nothing new here. It was a typical formulaic suspense, kidnap, heist thriller. Twenty years ago, when audiences hadn't seen 100 movies just like this, it probably would have faired better.<br /><br />Which brings me to my BIGGEST complaint of the film. The movie makers had the plot wrinkle, the film idea that in my opinon is the KISS of DEATH. And it showed. The bad guys kidnapped the FAMILY. The wife. The 9 year-old son. The 13 year-old daughter. So, why is this the kiss of death? Because throughtout the film, they do numerous things that a real life kidnapper would have killed one of them or at least dismembered or hurt one of them. Instead, the only ones that the kidnapper ever hurts are members of his OWN TEAM! Because Hollywoods mentality IS if you hurt a little kid like that... you'll lose your audience. I say... Bull. But, throughout the film, you just know that the filmmakers aren't gonna have the nuts to hurt one of those kids, so it ruins it.<br /><br />And believe me. You'll wonder after Jack Stanfield (Harrison Ford) tries to be brave three...four...five times in one day. Why the heck the kidnappers haven't put a bullet in one of his family members yet? Because you know a real life bad guy would. That, to me, was the biggest problem with the film. They didn't dare to be different and the so the film ended up being just another of the same ol' same ol'.</p></body></html>

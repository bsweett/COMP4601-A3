<meta name="summary" content="The lesser of the nominated best pictures of the year. Thrillingly conscientious film."></head><body><p>This film is splendid in its format and sometimes thrilling environments, but it seemed to me the ending (once again for SS) fell flat on its face under the weight of his trying to make a stupendously enlightening ending. While his attempt is admirable, I still cannot dismiss how banal and unsatisfying the ending is. The revelation to the proctagonist is much to be desired, and rather distasteful in that the moment of clarity of the absolute unfolding of events of Munich swam in the same filthy waters as him reaching the climax of his sexual encounter with his dispassioned wife. It was agonizing watching him pound away at his wife while the spiritual revelation was at once occuring to him, sending shocks down his neck in obvious pain, yet not deterring him from his animalistic passions. the Hit list in all of its method was tediously boring towards the end. I watched with pleading eyes for the movie to finish with its hit list, as every single one was, admittedly expertly, delivered, nonetheless overtly dramatic! This film, to me, recieved a polite nod for its attempt. It is an impossible feat of a script to settle on, and the topic is Hotter than sizzling grease! So I admire this historic team for getting their hands into it and showing the world an important film, though disatisfying.</p></body></html>

Taxi Driver is a mixed bag for me, parts of the film I find interesting but there are some slow and boring sections for me as well. Robert De Niro is a fantastic actor, this is his defining role. Jodie Foster is also good as well, she plays a young streetwalker and De Niro's character tries to save her from a life on filth and suffering. The ending is pretty good but I still unsatisfied with the whole film, it's an unique flick but not a classic, I prefer Raging Bull instead.</p></body></html>

One would think that a movie about a middle aged woman, bitter and boozed up up over the sudden disappearance of her cheating husband; and doing her best to raise her 4 adult daughters would scream "chick flick" and make for 2hrs of terribly unfunny male bashing.<br /><br />Instead.. what we get is a remarkably honest and relate able performance by Joan Allen. Her Terry Wolfmeyer is quite a character indeed. Terry is mad. MAD, MAD, MAD! After her hubby all but abandons her and her family, Terry whiles away the days watching TV with a smoke in one hand and a drink in the other. She's sarcastic to everyone she comes in contact with and is pretty much fed up with the suburban "American Dream".<br /><br />Enter neighbor Denny Davies, a ex baseball playing, pot smoking, beer guzzling radio talk show host - who after hearing about Terry's predicament- decides to become her new neighborly drinking buddy. He doesn't seem to mind Terry's moodiness and although she initially pushes him away- she tends to grow fond of his company.<br /><br />Of course, the two grow closer and closer until you can only guess what's developing....but the movie ends with a slight twist that this reviewer was not to particularly fond with.<br /><br />Ending aside however, the "Upside of Anger" is quite an entertaining and well acted piece of work. Having never, never, NEVER, been a Kevin Costner fan- this reviewer was immediately taken with his performance of Denny Davies. Costner shines in his supporting role fantastically. This is definitely some of his best work in years, if not ever. His strong presence helps "The Upside of Anger" become a movie that all audiences can thoroughly enjoy.<br /><br />There's a lot more to "The Upside of Anger" than what I've just mentioned above. Interesting sub plots with Terry's daughters and one of Denny's co-workers helps the film come full circle.<br /><br />Recommended!!</p></body></html>

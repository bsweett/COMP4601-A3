<meta name="summary" content="A classic horror film, but truly not very frightening"></head><body><p>I love The Shining and I saw it for the first time when I was 9 or 10. It scared me back then. Now, being 24, it still creeps me out, but as a whole, it really isn't a frightening movie. Thats not to say it isn't a good one. It is. The 2 little girls in the hall...There is no scarier image. It has been ingrained in my mind ever since I first saw it. The tense atmosphere certainly helps the movie out and the climax is quite suspenseful. The true reason this movie is rated so high is because of Jack Nicholson. He created this perfectly creepy character and people still quote him years later. He is the reason the movie succeeds in being a horror/thriller. Great actors make great movies, well mostly. Obviously over 20 years old, the movie look dated and bland at times, but it still stands the test of time and that is the most important thing. If you are looking for real scares however, look somewhere else.</p></body></html>

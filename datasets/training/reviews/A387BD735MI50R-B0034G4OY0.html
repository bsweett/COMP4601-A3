<meta name="summary" content="This Film is Too Filmy a Projection"></head><body><p>We have three separate human interest stories taking place in three distant locations here. I thought the stories were going to prove to have some sort of clever, complex connection, a la the disparate stories in "Crash." But the "Hereafter" is a let-down on that score. Characters from the three different subplots do end up crossing paths, but their final encounter turns out to be more a matter of geographical coincidence than anything integral to their back stories.<br /><br />The common thread of these stories is supposed to be a quest into the nature of the afterlife. But the consequences of each character's questioning turns out to be - inconsequential.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays a true psychic who rather vehemently and inexplicably refuses to give readings anymore, even to the point of slamming the door on a bereaved mother who desperately wants to make contact with her recently deceased child. Damon doesn't give any sufficient reason for giving up his work as a psychic and becoming a construction worker instead. He mumbles something about not wanting to live with death all the time. But this denial of his "gift" seems essentially inexplicable and perverse. His budding romance with a young woman who might have made some sense of it all evaporates into thin air. Her sudden defection from the San Francisco cooking class where they met is not sufficiently explained. She's just in the picture one minute - and gone the next.<br /><br />Then when the Damon character does relent and gives a psychic reading, the kinds of communications he extracts from the beyond are inane. "She wants you to be happy and remarry." "He says this weightless thing is really cool." Why would the departed wrench themselves from the spirit world simply to convey such banalities? And why would the living find such comfort in these pronouncements, other than seeing in them a reassurance that their loved one still does exist somewhere, in however tedious a frame of mind?<br /><br />The theme of the Hereafter rests on one further bit of illogic. When the French investigative reporter whose life is featured in the first vignette nearly dies in the tsunami that hit Thailand - we see her near-death experience as consisting only of the sighting of vague, filmy characters lined up like stelae, reaching out to her from some cloudy afterworld. However when she revives, she says the experience changed her life. Why would it?<br /><br />Each of the three vignettes is very well-acted, and would actually have stood on its own terms as an absorbing, low-key insight into the everyday life of a distinctive personality. There's the French news anchor living a very Parisienne life. There are identical twin brothers living with a heart-warmingly dysfunctional/functional mother in England. Then there's Damon's psychic character turning his back on his visions. We see details of each life and each setting that draw us into personal knowledge of the individuals, like well-written essays draw us into a feeling of personal acquaintanceship with the authors.<br /><br />But the attempt to unite these separate lives with the overarching theme of life-after-death proves to be a bit too forced. The keystone of the Hereafter is just too weak to brace this film into anything substantial and long-standing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a beautiful performance by Paz Vega"></head><body><p>Paz Vega starts a new job as a maid for restaurant owner and dad Adam Sandler (Punch Drunk-Love, The Longest Yard) and his talkative wife Tea Leoni (Deep Impact, The Family Man). Leoni has 2 kids, a son and a daughter and Vega has one daughter who has to translate for her and soon after Vega starts to learn English on her own. Cloris Leachman (History Of The World Part 1, High Anxiety), in a superb supporting role, plays Leoni's crazy mother. A good natured movie such as this is a breathe of fresh air with a beautiful performane by Paz Vega and a excellent role for Adam Sandler who still has the funny guy in him but he show's us again he can do other things. Tea Leoni's charcter is hard to like though Leoni is perfect for the part. The kids are all great. Love your mother and family is the theme for this movie and James L. Brooks (As Good As It Gets, The Simpsons) does it all too well. Thomas Haden Church (Sideways, Rolling Kansas) stars as the man Leoni has the affair</p></body></html>

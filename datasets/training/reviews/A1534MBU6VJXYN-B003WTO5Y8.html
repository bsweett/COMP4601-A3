However, I had begged my parents to let me watch it. So, I put it on my Christmas list, and low and behold, it was sitting under my Christmas tree on December 25th. However, I did not watch it until today.<br /><br />A serial killer known as Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) is kidnapping women across the Midwest and murdering them by skinning them alive. Baffled by these disturbing turn of events, the FBI sends trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to interview a prisoner who could give anwers to the killer's motivations. That prisoner is Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a cannibal who is also a brilliant pyschologist who knows everything about the criminal mind. He agrees to help Clarice, but only if she divulges to him the dark details of her own life. But when Bill kidnaps the daughter of a renowned Memphis senator, Clarice cannot play this game any longer, for time is running out. This leads to a startling climax that will stay with you forever.<br /><br />"The Silence Of The Lambs" truly deserves the praise that is heaped upon it. It is one of if not the best suspense thrillers ever made. This film is so disturbing that one wonders if all this really happened (indeed, Buffalo Bill was actually an amalgam of several different real life serial killers).<br /><br />The acting is superb. Jodie Foster is brilliant as Clarice. She portrays this tough, courageous and fearful women like no one else can and she truly deserved the Best Actres Oscar. Ted Levine is so creepy that it actually makes you sick. Why he was not awarded is something I've pondered. Scott Glenn adds ample support in the lesser role of Clarice's boss, Jack Crawford. However, throughout, the whole film, our focus remains on Hopkins. As Lecter, Hopkins creates one of the single greatest performances in film history. You wait in anticipation for what he's going to say or do next. You are drawn into the mind of this man. One could never imagine that a man who eats people could be so likeable.<br /><br />the extra features I haven't watched yet, but they look great. Still, you should definitely watch the film first. It's worth it, trust me.</p></body></html>

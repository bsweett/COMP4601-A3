<meta name="summary" content="The best thriller of all time"></head><body><p>While I say this is the best thriller of all time, this is one of the best movies of all time.  In addition, it contains the greatest villain in cinematic history - Dr. Hannibal Lectar - played by Anthony Hopkins who gives as oscar-winning performance (easily his most memorable of his career).  Add an oscar-winning performance by Jodie Foster as the investigator in training "Clarice Starling" and a great supporting cast, incredible story, and just the right amount of gore and creepiness and you get just about a perfect movie that can easily entertain anyone who loves movies.<br /><br />If you have never seen this movie, you don't know what you are missing out on.  Maybe its the disturbing imagery that has kept you away, or the sickening themes attached to the villains, but in reality its kind of mild compared to movies today such as Saw and Hostel.  Unlike Saw & Hostel, Silence of The Lambs is a classic, that shows just the right amount of disturbing imagery and sickness to fill the balance of the movie.  There is no overload, for the movie's finest achievemnt is told within its superb story, and not through its R rating.  The film has many layers of story being told, and its kind of three dimensional.<br /><br />There are two villains in the story.  The first is Buffalo Bill, who everyone is attempting to capture.  He's kind of the villain on the surface of the film, but the real person to admire is Hannibal Lecter.  He is behind bars in the start of the film, but he is a very deep and complex person, and unlike any villain you've seen before.  He eats the rude and loves to search deep into your mind, as he does with the young Clarice who he develops a unqiue likeness to.  As for Bill, Hannibal knows a great deal about him, and is the only source Clarice can find for information, but not before Hannibal dives into he mind and forces her to recall her troubling past and apply it to her present situation.  It is a very deep connection the two share, that both actors share a wonderful and unique chemistry for.  Truly the best thing about this film and adds real depth to the story.<br /><br />In favor of a terrific and suspenseful film, I will not give away any more details about the story or Buffalo Bill.  It is also a great mystery and puzzle-solver, attempting to locate this villain who has committed crimes that, well, you just have to see for youself - though a bit disgusting.  Silence of The Lambs is a must own to complete a great home movie collection.  It is one of the most memorable movies of all time, that creepy enough, will probably stick with you for the rest of your life.<br /><br />Acting - 5<br />Charcaters - 5<br />Horror - 5<br />Story - 5<br />Overall - 5</p></body></html>

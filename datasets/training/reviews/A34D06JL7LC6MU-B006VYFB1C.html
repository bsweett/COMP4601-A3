<meta name="summary" content="Intelligent, Crowd-Pleasing Entertainment"></head><body><p>I admit that (as a non-sports fan) I don't typically enjoy sports-themed films. They tend to be uplifting or inspiring in some way, but they're ultimately just too generic for my taste. Moneyball, based on Michael Lewis' book of the same name and derived from a true story, isn't a run-of-the-mill baseball movie and successfully breaks from some of those generic conventions, while managing to be crowd-pleasing enough for the average viewer. Adapted by two Academy Award-winning screenwriters, Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin (coincidentally, the writers behind David Fincher's previous two films), it's an intelligent, well-structured film that moves quickly and hits all the right emotional cues.<br /><br />`Based on a true story' is a relative term in Hollywood and I'm not sure how closely Moneyball sticks to the truth in its story, but that has little bearing on how well the story is told. Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, a former Major League baseball player, working as the general manager of the Oakland Athletics. Upset with his underfunded team's recent loss and the impending departure of three star players, Billy attempts to overcome the financial restrictions that stand in his way of putting together a competitive. At a failed meeting, Billy meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a young man with an economics degree from Yale, who specializes in player analysis. Using a sabermetric approach, based on a theory by Bill James, Brand has formulated an unorthodox way to assess a player's value. Beane hires Peter as Assistant General Manager and begins to put his theories to the test, despite the opposition from the more traditional baseball scouts who don't see the theories assisting Billy's ramshackle team. Billy faces a particularly dismissive attitude from the Oakland A's manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who refuses to put some of Billy and Peter's ideas into motion due to his stress of working under a one-year contract. Baseball history buffs may know how everything pans out here, but I found it mostly unexpected.<br /><br />Pitt is charismatic and quick-witted in his role. It's a gum-smacking, charming performance that is just subtle enough to score a potential Oscar win. He has some tough competition, but appearing in two of the best films of the year certainly won't hurt his chances. Hill has received some attention for playing against type and he shows a previously unseen dramatic depth playing Peter Brand. Hill has been written off in some circles as a one-note comedic actor, but with his performance here and in last year's Cyrus he proves that he may have quite the emotional well to tap from. I wouldn't call his performance Oscar-worthy (no reflection on him, it's just not written to be), but his character is such a departure from his typical sarcastic persona, as well as likable and meek enough, that he may be nominated for one of the big awards. The screen is populated with some fine actors, but with so much focus on Pitt and Hill most are relegated to the background. Hoffman, reuniting with director Bennett Miller, who directed Hoffman to Oscar glory in Capote, deserves some recognition for his role as the cynical manager. Also noteworthy is Robin Wright as Billy's ex-wife and director Spike Jonze, in a one-scene role, as Wright's awkward new husband.<br /><br />Unheard of in a baseball movie, there is more focus on people behind the scenes rather than on the field. The statistics and those who used them are the focal point, with attention being given to the players and actual on-field games only when it's necessary for an emotional payoff or to further the plot. Like he did in his Oscar-winning script for The Social Network, Sorkin takes numbers and data that would be incomprehensible to the average person in life and dull/confusing onscreen and somehow makes these pass by in an accessible, compelling manner. Along with Zaillian, he has made the thinking-man's baseball movie that, ironically, does the thinking for you.<br /><br />Moneyball is a strange version of the Hollywood, sports film that follows the traditional template enough to draw viewers in and breaks from it enough to please viewers looking for something a little different. With two of Hollywood's brightest screenwriters, a talented director, and an eclectic cast giving some terrific performances, it carries a rather anti-Hollywood message and is accessible enough to be enjoyed by sports fans and non-sports fans. Against the odds, it's an exceptional slice of Americana and extraordinarily crowd-pleasing entertainment.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

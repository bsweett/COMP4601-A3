The film wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either, and watching the teaser trailer made me think it was going to be another Kingpin, man. I wasn't wrong, but thankfully, it didn't focus that much on the bowling, dude. This film is a tad off the wall, man. The words "dude" and "man" are littered amongst the dialogue, you try to block it out, but they seem to emphasis the words each time they say it, dude. Seems to have a few reasonably "big" names, including John Goodman, Jeff Bridges, Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore and Tara Reid, but it doesn't seem appear to have that big a budget, man.<p>Jeff Bridges looks older and slightly greyer than the only other role I've seen him in, `Starman', dude. Steve Buscemi plays a quiet character: he gets ignored, he doesn't know what John Goodman is talking about most of the time and subsequently gets told to shut up, man. The classic line "dude where's my car" is uttered so obviously whoever made that, was watching this, dude. Julianne Moore's non-geographical accent gets on my nerves, and she just has to appear naked, man.<p>The phone seems to constantly ring in this, particularly in the first half, for no apparent reason, and no one seems to answer it - just there to get on the viewer's nerves, dude.<p>The scene with the naked chick being thrown up and down accompanied by high-pitched music - what exactly was all that about, man? A scene for the guys and what do the girls get, dude? John Goodman's stomach, man.<p>I laughed a couple of times, but the best bit was when John Goodman throws a bowling ball into the bad guy's nether regions, dude.<p>Judging by the ending, they must have run out of storyline, or money, man. Also, according to the back of this DVD, it was 98 minutes long, but its 116 minutes, and is listed as 127 minutes in a movie book, dude.<p>This film is a meandering series of events, vaguely connected, with no real ending, man. You definitely have to be stoned or drunk to watch this, and I was neither, dude.<p>Extras include a good teaser trailer; a very boring making of; and cast and filmmakers biogs, man.</p></body></html>

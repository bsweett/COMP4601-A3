<meta name="summary" content="A Cinematic Nightmare"></head><body><p>At a cost of over $ 150,000,000 to make, and overtaken at the box office by the "SpongeBob" movie, "Alexander" is the 21st century "Heaven's Gate." The participants in this epic disaster should hope that few people see this film, because like "Heaven's Gate" in 1981, this could be a career-breaker. Oliver Stone's direction, working with a weak and often preposterous script, is a major catastrophe. The only scene that works in the entire 3 hours of this film is when the young Alexander (Connor Paolo, the only cast member whose reputation as an actor remains untarnished) tames the wild horse Bucephalus.<br /><br />As Alexander, Colin Farrell is hopeless. Instead of having a commanding presence, as one would assume Alexander had to have, he is feeble and gives us a "smaller than life" hero, a puppy dog in need of his lover Haphastion (Jared Leno in heavy eye makeup). He also not only has a thick Irish accent, but very poor diction. An actor getting major roles should be skilled enough to remove regional traces from his speaking voice, and be able to acquire a "non-accent."<br /><br />Another vocal treasure is Angelina Jolie, who pouts and plays with her pet snake collection, and sounds exactly like Lotte Lenya in "From Russia with Love." If this film makes a dent in the Hollywood history books, it will be for this bizarre characterization of Olympias. What was Jolie thinking, and why did Stone allow it?<br /><br />The quasi-historical epic of heroism and adventure is my favorite genre, and I wanted to enjoy this film, but was almost repulsed by it. If you want to see a towering failure, this is it. Filmed in Morocco, there are miles of rusty colored desert, and the landscape was much better served in the made for TV Bible films. The soundtrack by Vangelis is also unsuccessful, and in many scenes seems to be out-of-synch with the action on the screen. This ranks as one of the worst films I have ever seen, reminding me a little of Bob Guccione's "Caligula," except the actors are wearing clothes. Arf! This one is a dog.</p></body></html>

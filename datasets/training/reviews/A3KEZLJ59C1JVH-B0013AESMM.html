<meta name="summary" content=""The Bad One""></head><body><p>The premise of this movie is a good one: Erica Bain (Jodie Foster), a public radio essayist, and her fiance, David (Naveen Andrews), are violently attacked in Central Park one night by a couple of hoodlums. David doesn't survive, and Erica remains unconscious for weeks before finally reemerging in a new world where she finds herself completely alone. Afraid but determined never to be a victim again, Erica purchases a firearm illegally, and soon finds herself threatened by a man in a convenience store. Erica uses her gun to protect herself, and finds that the only way she can cope with her new life is to go around New York City and take out a bunch of bad guys vigilante-style.<br /><br />Foster delivers an excellent performance in this movie, as usual, and Terrence Howard is great in his role of a police detective. Unfortunately, though, there are so many things about this movie that are completely far-fetched, from the outrageous number of dangerous situations Erica finds herself in day after day to the behavior of Howard's character when he finds out exactly what Erica's been up to. It's very disappointing, because "The Brave One" has all the makings of a really great movie, but the script itself is really stupid in places, and that ruined the whole film for me. The best thing about the movie is that Erica's dog ends up okay at the end, and that's about all I really cared about by the time the film was over. What a waste of two hours of my life (and of Jodie Foster's talent)!</p></body></html>

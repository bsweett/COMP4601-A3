<meta name="summary" content="Blood Is Thicker Than Anything"></head><body><p>Somewhere in Texas, bank robber Seth Gecko (George Clooney) and his brother Ritchie are in a tight spot. They've got two gorgeous hostages at gunpoint (who were those angels anyway, and why were their roles so small?), and are anxiously waiting for the local lawman to make his way out of the roadside liquor store they're hiding in. Things don't move fast enough for psychopath Ritchie (Quentin Tarantino) when the cop asks to use the restroom, so bullets start flying. Let the bloodbath begin! From here on out, it's carnage candy, Tarantino/Rodriguez style!<br /><br />Seth and Ritchie, who is now shot through the hand, head south for the Mexican border with a ton of dirty money and a slightly less attractive hostage in their trunk (why they let those other two go and kept this one I'll never understand). They eventually stop at a cruddy little motel to eat and plan their next move. Seth foolishly leaves the hostage with his maniacal brother as he goes out for burgers. When he returns, he finds her a victim of rape and murder; brother Ritchie acting like the innocent victim. These guys have problems.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the completely innocent Fuller family, former Minister Jacob and his two teenage children Scott and Kate, have found themselves at the same motel. Seth eyes their motor home and decides it's exactly the transportation he and his brother need to get them across the border with their money, and to the nudie bar where they plan to meet their shady business associates in the morning. Before we know it, the Fuller family is taken hostage, and the whole gang is on the road down Mexico way. After a brief search by a perverted Border Patrol Agent, our little group of adventurers is given the okay to cross, and soon enough they find themselves at the most boisterous gentlemen's club on either side of the border. Once inside, the gang is treated to a show like most of them have never seen before, featuring Salma Hayek as the main attraction. But when Ritchie gets himself into a scuffle and his bloody hand starts flowing red again, the mood of the hosts begins to change, drastically. As it turns out, the ancient Mexican nudie bar is run entirely by vampires! Soon, our anti-hero Seth is leading his hostages and a couple of new friends on a fight to save their lives, at least until dawn!<br /><br />From Dusk Till Dawn is exactly what you'd expect from a Tarantino/Rodriguez vampire collaboration! And, like all the Tarantino films I've seen so far, every second of it is totally captivating. You don't want to miss a moment! Yes, it's violent to the extreme, but you should be expecting that. There's more than that, though. You get a Tarantino style tale of redemption, survival, and triumph of the human spirit over the most evil of adversaries. The entire cast is first rate, including Tom Savini's best work as "Sex Machine," the outlaw biker, reminiscent of the character he played in the original Dawn of the Dead. This film is part "Pulp Fiction," part "Night of the Living Dead," and part "Vamp," all rolled into one kickbutt ball of pure adrenaline. With the awesome make-up and creature effects and the excellent soundtrack, it's easily among the best Vampire movies ever made. And, for me, the real payoff is that pull-away shot in the end, when we get the FULL view of the Mexican nudie-bar. Definitely one to watch over and over again. I also can recommend "From Dusk Till Dawn 3," a pretty decent direct to video prequel that tells the tale of how Salma Hayek's character came to be the leader of this very ancient clan of bloodsuckers. From "Dusk Till Dawn 2" wasn't all that great on the other hand, but hey, it's not unwatchable, and ya gotta have the whole set. Oh, one more thing! I'm serious, where can I find out more about those two angelic hostages in the beginning, Aimee and Heidi? God, they were gorgeous! E-mail me, ladies!</p></body></html>

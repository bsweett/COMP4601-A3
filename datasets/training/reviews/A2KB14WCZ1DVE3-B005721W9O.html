<meta name="summary" content="Nails the Star Trek world, good and bad, down cold"></head><body><p>It wasn't so much that I wasn't a fan of Star Trek.  It was more of a complete dislike for William Shatner in the lead role.  I always found him a smug, arrogant actor that seemed to be giving the minimum amount of effort in order to garner a paycheck.  The fact that he more or less has alluded to such over the years proves the point.  The show itself was extraordinarily innovative for it's time, and it's too bad such a big presence had to bring it down.  <p>Galaxy Quest captures everything I like and hate about the show perfectly.  It begins by mercilessly slamming the situation of the former cast of the show, years after it's run on TV.  The cast is reduced to getting paychecks by enduring fans at conventions who live and breathe what the actors gave up doing years ago.  When not doing conventions, they have to endure fans who live and breathe Galaxy Quest at electronics store openings.<p>The most hilarious character at this point is Alan Rickman, who seemed to have a budding theatrical career that was put on permanent hold when the show's popularity became his destiny.  The bad guy of "Die Hard" proves to be a great comedic actor as someone who would rather die than utter another of his Dr. Spockish sayings.<p>While I don't believe William Shatner ever showed the exuberance for conventions that Tim Allen does at the beginning, it does setup  a temporary downfall that propels the rest of the plot.  Allen goes into a deep funk when overhearing in a washroom how pathetic the whole cast is.  This funk is only overcome when real aliens beam him up and he sees a chance to save the universe.  Or at least revive his career.<p>The genius of the movie is how, once the rest of the cast is also beamed up, that we actually care deeply for the characters and start rooting for the good guys.  Excellent special effects, especially with the unstoppable Rock Monster, take them deeper and deeper into a situation where they have to make serious decisions, while at the same time keeping their comedic edge.  <p>While the veterans all do great work, my favorite is Sam Rockwell, who plays one of the superfans who happened to be an extra in one of the past episodes.  At first he elevates himself to the stardom of the others by asking if he can sit at the autograph table with the main characters and get the 8 x 10's he has made of himself also autographed.  But when the action gets fast and furious, he realizes that his role is usually to get killed off before the end of the plot.  This anxiety is hilarious throughout the movie.<p>Oh yes, it's also great for all ages.</p></body></html>

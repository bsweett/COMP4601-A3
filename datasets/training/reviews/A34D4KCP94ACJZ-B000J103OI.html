That's alright though because whenever that happens I usually end up having lower expectations then usual and find the viewing experience to be better than expected.  This was not the case with The Devil Wears Prada, as this little movie did have a lot of hype, even among movie snobs and cinephiles like me.  It seemed that critically this was on a higher level than the chick flicks I typically find myself rolling my eyes to after my wife has gained control over the television.  After the viewing I think it is fair to say that The Devil Wears Prada deserves every bit of praise it has received in 2006.<br /><br />From what I understand this movie was adapted for the screen from a novel written a few years ago.  Andrea or Andy (Anne Hathaway) is a new Northwestern graduate and somewhat nerdy and awkward girl who just received a job as a co-assistant for a highly demanding editor of a fashion magazine named Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep).  Andy is at least awkward and nerdy in Miranda's competitive and ostentatious world.  Most girls would love Andy's opportunity but Andy doesn't seem to care and for a while even sees herself as above the fashion culture.  Andy fails to fit in well and it grates on her.  She is also employed by a horribly demanding boss in Priestly.  Miranda Priestly is notorious and after some time Andy begins to enjoy the challenge, especially after the entire supporting cast in the film doubts she can last.  Also, Andy's opportunities will expand tremendously if she can prove to exist under Miranda for a significant amount of time.  There are good side plots and certain developments which I won't reveal, but rest assured the film is fun.<br /><br />The screenplay is written to be palpable to a wide audience and that can make a film outside of this viewer's favorite genres more entertaining.  However, it is the cast in The Devil Wears Prada that makes it a success.  Meryl Streep definitely delivered one of the most effective comedic performances I have seen in years.  Her nomination for an Oscar was well-deserved for several reasons. I hold out hope that it is her understanding of the dry humor and arrogance in Miranda's character that earned her the nomination and not the mushy scenes that typically earn attention from the Academy.  Meryl is outstanding and the character allows for an amazing display of her talent.  To Anne Hathaway's credit, she holds her own in each scene and her ability to make Andy likeable in a situation where I could've just as easily sympathized with the villain deserves some praise as well.  I was even more surprised by the supporting cast here, especially Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci who played distinctively different roles than I'm used to seeing them play.<br /><br />The Devil Wears Prada is a not a profound film that attempts to comment on larger things.  If it did, it would've failed.  That isn't to say the film lacks depth entirely and manages not to say anything.  It has its points.  I had trouble at first trying to figure out where The Devil Wears Prada stood as a critique of the fashion culture it is showing us, but that was not what the film set out to do.  The fashion world is merely the film's setting to tell this story.  One of the best messages I got from The Devil Wears Prada also happened to be the one that placed the film squarely against the grain of on-the-surface similar stories.  The story allowed me to pragmatically support its villain.  If Miranda Priestly were a man she would have the respect of her colleagues but instead they fear her.  That point brought The Devil Wears Prada away from conventional comedy and into a coming of age story for Andy as in many ways she began to respect Miranda just as we do.  It cut much deeper than I expected, even with all that hype.</p></body></html>

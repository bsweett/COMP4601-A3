Every baby boomer's nightmare.  However, the old rock, Pete Seeger and Paul Simon songs lulled me into a "oh boy" factor -- and in a lot of ways it was "oh boy."<br /><br />The fight scenes were nicely choreographed.  Silk Spectre II and the Night Owl made a great team.<br /><br />Did I care for the Comedian or that he was murdered early in the film?  Nope.  A very anti-hero's hero.  Whatever heroism he had in the Forties was lost on me.  Beating up and raping, shooting a pregnant woman, -- in fact, women were handled fairly badly throughout the film purely for shock value.  What was Alan Moore thinking?<br /><br />There's a difference between breaking the mold in comic book or filming and then there's just plain porn.  Porn in the sense of  blood and guts and gore and Moore's almost misogynous writing as well as  the broken bones cutting through flesh, chopping off limbs with a saw, and buckets of blood -- a lot of the violence a bit too much.<br /><br />A film not for the squeamish.<br /><br />Zack Snyder's 300 was quite the tour de force -- the ancients were as bad and as bloody as they came complete with "madness."<br /><br />Watchmen was uneven.  I was thrilled ,repulsed and excited and depressed all at once.<br /><br />Almost like an X-rated "the Incredibles"; heroes being banned (becoming and old hat plot) and then coming back -- except in The Incredibles the heroes won.  In Watchmen, the "heroes" put a lot of people away in the name of "peace."<br /><br />Ozymandias' doubtful morals and Rorschach's intense right-wing ethics makes the film watchable.<br /><br />Recommended, but not for the squeamish.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930289234">Watchmen</a></p></body></html>

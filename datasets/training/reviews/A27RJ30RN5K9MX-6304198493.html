<meta name="summary" content="Definately one of my all time favorites"></head><body><p>The film centers around five different criminals in New York that are locked up together, based on a trumped up weapons charge. After their release, they decide to work together and get revenge, by commiting crimes. However, someone else is controlling the events that take place. The five men soon discover that they are connected to each other because they have all pulled jobs where they unknowingly ripped off a man going by the alias of Keiser Sose. The mysterious Keiser Sose is basically thought of as the Devil himself in the criminal underworld. The five men are thrust into a world of danger and mystery as they work together to discover the true identity of Keiser Sose.<br /><br />Bryan Singer's "The Usual Suspects" is one of the best films ever made in my opinion. If I had to create a list of my five favorite films, it would definately be on that list. When it comes to most mystery films, I can only usually watch them once. Once I know how the film will end, I can never make myself sit through them again because the suprise of what comes next is gone. The thing that impresses me the most about The Usual Suspects, is that the acting and overall storytelling of the film are so well done, that each viewing provides for a rewarding experience despite the fact that I know how it will end. In fact, the film only seems to get better after each time that I see it. The film unfolds brilliantly. It is set up in the format of an interrogation between one of the five men and a U.S. customs agent, giving us flashbacks on the events that led up to that moment in time. The whole film will keep you guessing from one minute to the next, and it culminates in of the greatest endings of all time. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film, is how director Bryan Singer handles the character of Keiser Sose. The film does a great job at making Sose look like the most imposing and frightening criminal ever, and the fact that his true identity has been kept a secret, only makes the character that much more appealing. You come to believe throughout the course of the movie, that Sose could literally be the Devil himself.<br /><br />Another thing to point out about this film, is that The Usual Suspects probably has one of the best ensemble casts I have ever seen. The five men that the story focuses on are played by five very skilled actors. Gabriel Byrne stars as Dan Keaton who is the leader of the group. Keaton is a character that has two sides to his personality. On one hand, Keaton is chosen as the leader because of how cold, calculating, and evil he is overall. But on the other hand, he gains respect from the men he works with for the code of honor that he lives by which makes him likeable at times. Gabriel Byrne places both sides brilliantly. This film also marks the breakout role for actor Kevin Spacey with his portrayal of a crippled con artist named Verbal Kint. Spacey had to do the most work in the film without a doubt because he not only had to perform scenes in the events that unfold, but Verbal Kint is also the man that is forced to sit through the interigation where we learn about the events that unfold and how they went down. Spacey does a great job on both ends, and is also very convincing as a cripple. He also has great on screen chemistry with Chaz Palmentari who plays customs agent David Kullan that interrogates Verbal. He was outstanding, because of his relentless nature. The rest of the cast includes Benecio Del Toro in one of his best roles ever, Stephen Baldwin, and Kevin Pollack.<br /><br />This highly entertaining and suspenseful mystery, will become an instant favorite of yours. Christopher McQuarrie's amazing script and Singer's trademark style of directing, really make this film a masterpiece. The DVD is worth the money alone just for the extras. Some of them include never before seen deleted scenes, audio commentaries by director Bryan Singer & writer Christopher McQuarrie, three featurettes, a gag reel , and much more.<br /><br />A solid 5/5...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Winter's Bone has Forboding Tones but a Rewarding Story"></head><body><p>At times this two million dollar Best Picture Oscar nominee is a joyless albeit compelling journey, but for those who know the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316066419">story</a> that Daniel Woodrell adapted his amazing screenplay on, there is far too much vigor in these characters for it be written off as gloomy and not worth the casual film-goer's time.  The mortifying journey's destination is a lively reward indeed.<br /><br />Winter's Bone is without question one of the year's best movies in what amounts to be a very potent field of candidates.  It has been nominated for four Oscars altogether, one additional being the aforementioned adapted screenplay and the others being for performances by its lead Jennifer Lawrence and another for her co-star John Hawkes.  Both are worthy, but given the similar subtle cold determination in their characters I can't help but think it is much more than just things that tie these characters together, but the powerful style this film was intentionally created to possess.  There are very strong controllers behind the scenes here.  Those strengths and many more are directorial ones, and Debra Granik (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I0QL7I">Down to the Bone</a>) might deserve the most credit of all.  She's been snubbed of an Oscar in my opinion.  The film's cinematography by Michael McDonaugh (who's also credited as a producer) as well as its editing also deserve tremendous praise.<br /><br />Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 17 year old girl growing up in The Ozarks.  To say she's experienced a difficult life is an understatement.  Her father is arrested and jumps bond.  Her mother is likely a catatonic schizophrenic while Ree plays the role of surrogate mother to her two younger siblings.  Her father is soon about to cost them their home and he must be found to prevent an already horrible life from getting far worse.<br /><br />The obvious thing about this movie is the future stardom of Jennifer Lawrence.  She's going to be a big deal but in a good way.  The 20 year old is talented in ways that no actress of her generation has yet to display.  Her quiet and layered performance as Ree may not win her the Oscar but she sure does deserve it.  She's so deeply engaged in her character that in scenes where her face maintains a gaze of melancholy bravery, she manages to show us glimpses of what her character is feeling beneath it all.  I think of the fleeting look of joy while seeing a small country band at a birthday party play their fiddles and how badly I wanted to see her smile.  Her character's emotions are contained but apparent, as even her tears are inhibited before they finally see air.  She made Ree among the greatest heroes to appear in film in the last few years.  I hope Hollywood doesn't kidnap Lawrence and make her play superheroes but I fear it's too late.<br /><br />Perhaps the less obvious thing about Winter's Bone is that Debra Granik will go on to create more great movies, but I do suspect with confidence that will happen.  This film is certainly not to be missed.  Everything about it comes together beautifully to tell a very compelling story.  I can't recommend it enough.</p></body></html>

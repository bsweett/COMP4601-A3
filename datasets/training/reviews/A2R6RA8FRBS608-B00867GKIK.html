<meta name="summary" content="a blockbuster family film with an emotional punch"></head><body><p>"Up" is an outstanding motion picture; and it earned the honor of being the first animated 3D film to open the Cannes Film Festival. No wonder, too--the story is endearing with lots of action depicting the classic struggle of good versus evil; the animation is the best I've ever seen and the voiceovers leave nothing to be desired. The plot moves along very nicely with good character development and the action works very well alongside the tender message of the film that left me with a tear in my eye. Indeed, "Up" will remain one of the finest animated films of all time because it deals with so many universal issues and themes we think about in life--friendship, loyalty, love, the struggle of good versus evil and the desire to make your biggest dreams come true.<br /><br />The film starts with us meeting two young kids, Carl and Ellie who worship their childhood idol, South American explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Carl and Ellie play together as kids and they grow up to be sweethearts and marry, too.  They are happy together; but their childhood dream of going to Paradise Falls where Charles Muntz discovered bones from an exotic bird never gets accomplished. Muntz has long since returned to Paradise Falls after he was labeled a fraud back home; he told reporters when he left again for South America's Paradise Falls that he will bring back the actual bird dead or alive to prove his discovery was real but he never returned.<br /><br />With time, Ellie and Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) become elderly and Ellie passes away. Carl's house is forever being threatened by new construction; and the court orders him to live at Shady Oaks nursing home after Carl accidentally hits construction worker Steve (voiced by Danny Mann) with his mailbox! Carl also meets a young wilderness explorer, Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai). Carl devises a successful plan to have his house float away to Paradise Falls using helium balloons; but after taking off, Carl soon discovers that Russell is along for the ride!<br /><br />Of course, there's much, much more to the plot with action and heartrending scenes that really are memorable. I don't want to spoil it for you by giving too much away. Suffice it to say that Carl does get to South America with Russell where they meet Kevin, a rare bird that loves chocolate and Dug (voiced by Bob Peterson), an incredibly sweet golden retriever. Unfortunately, however, there are some other animals that are not exactly friendly; and this causes huge problems after their other encounter with the now elderly and rather evil Charles Muntz.<br /><br />This two DVD set comes with wonderful bonus features. We get an animated short entitled "Partly Cloudy;" "Adventure Is Out There;" "Dug's Special Mission;" an optional running commentary with co-directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson--and more! The second DVD lets you access the digital copy and the digital copy code is provided with the artwork inside the DVD case.<br /><br />"Up" just couldn't be better; the film leaves nothing to be desired. This two DVD set may not be in Blu-ray; but the quality of the picture is very, very good; I am invariably impressed by the fine animation from Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Pictures but this time they really outdid themselves! I cannot recommend this film highly enough.</p></body></html>

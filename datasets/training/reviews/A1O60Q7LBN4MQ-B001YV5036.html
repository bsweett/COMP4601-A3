He's a good actor but he's such a creep in real life. Also, I'm not a fan of boxing. Yet, I tend to like boxing movies. Go figure. :^/<br /><br />Well, this movie had lots of heart. How can you not like an upstanding person that James J. Braddock was portrayed to be? He loved his family and he tries so hard to keep his family feed and off the street during the Great Depression. It was important that his family stay together. You want the man to win.</p></body></html>

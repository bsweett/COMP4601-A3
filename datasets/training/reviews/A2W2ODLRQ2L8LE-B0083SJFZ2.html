<meta name="summary" content="A Greek Mythology Visual Feast"></head><body><p>Greek mythology yields itself marvellously well to massive cinematic experiences. The wide shots include lots of very beautiful seashore, wilderness and forest scenes. These set the scenes wonderfully well for the adventure elements contained within this film. Also in this film, a lot of the creatures are presented, some friendly, and many that pose as formidable foes. A brave band of men set out on a journey to save the life of a princess after the foolish and arrogant boasts of a queen that was less than discrete.<br /><br />Included in this 'fellowship' is Perseus (Sam Worthington), the son of Zeus.<br /><br />The story is centered around the Greek city Argos. As the movie begins, there is a narration. We learn about the three main Olympians who battled in the distant past: the brothers Zeus (Liam Neeson), Poseidon (Danny Huston), and Hades (Ralph Fiennes). However, it was Hades who provided the means of defeating the Titans with his creation, the Kraken. After the Titans' defeat, Zeus created humans and ruled them, while Poseidon ruled the sea, but Hades, having been betrayed by Zeus, was forced to rule the Underworld. Zeus and Poseidon gain power from the prayers of humans, but Hades gets his power through fear.<br /><br />Humanity has gotten tired of the Olympians, and their self-serving ways and has started to rebel against them, this has led to Hades being given the authority to loose the Kraken upon humanity. (But Hades has not forgotten the betrayal of Zeus in the past.)<br /><br />This is a cinematic wonder with lots of very good CG animations that appear flawless. There is a lot of excitement and of particular focus was the encounter with Medusa - a lot of men were lost in this battle and it was simple awesome watching the men turn to stone.<br /><br />This story may have been told a thousand times, but so what? This one is still worth seeing. If you like adventure and action, rest assured that this movie delivers on the goods big time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="All Religous Talk Aside, Ron Howard Delivers An Entertaining Film Highlighted By Great Performances"></head><body><p>MOVIE: One of the most anticipated film projects in the last few years finally hits the big screen and comes flying out the gate. The Da Vinci Code had a huge opening weekend and earned $77 million, it also made film history by having the largest worldwide gross on opening weekend for any film ever made. Worldwide, the film grossed a massive $224 million against a budget of only $125 million in only 3 days. This is huge, so apparently all the negative reviews did not stop movie goers. Why did this film get trashed the way it did? It absolutely blows my mind that Poseidon has better reviews on Rotten Tomatoes than this film. Ron Howard provides a constant direction for the film and it never really gets off track. I found myself completely engrossed in the plot. It must have been a daunting task given that the book itself has sold over 60 million copies, and there is a huge fanbase awaiting this film. I have not read the book, but I know a few people who did and they all enjoyed the film and said it was a very faithful adaptation. Akiva Goldsman's screenplay was focused and very detailed even though some of the dialogue did make the film slip into melodrama in a few places. The movie was not necessarily thrilling, but it was very interesting and it always held my attention. A lot of people complained about its length, but never once in my mind when I was seeing it did I think that it started to drag. The film is really about this one man's personal journey through this entire ordeal. I could go into detail about the religious aspect of the film, but I won't because I think when people argue about religion it makes both sides of the argument look stupid. All the controversial stuff aside, this is a well made and very detailed film. It has great complex characters with lots of details within the plot with lots of historical references. When you get down to the basics of this movie, it's really nothing more than a hunt for the holy grail. I found it to be a great entertaining experience. There were a few editing choices that I was not fond of, some of the flashbacks were not handled well. Overall, it was a great hero's journey that comes full circle at the end.  I have to admit though, the film would have been incredibly dull if it weren't for Hans Zimmer's amazing score. Even though Hans Zimmer is my favorite composer, this is not a biased statement. For those who have seen the film, try and imagine the end sequence where the final revelation is revealed without the music. Lots of the scenes were heavily dependent on music and Hans Zimmer delivered an amazing score. There were some truly breathtaking cues in his score, and in the end the film was saved by the music.<br /><br />ACTING: I found the casting for this film to be perfect. Tom Hanks was a perfect fit for Robert Langdon in my opinion. He holds that intelligent poise that a brilliant professor would have. Audrey Tautou overacts just a tad bit at times, but then again one could blame the script's melodramatic dialogue. Ian McKellen is brilliant as Sir Leigh and at times steals the show. Other supporting work comes from Paul Bettany and Jean Reno. Bettany was terrific as Silas the albino monk and he really made him a dynamic character. At times he looked exactly like Ralph Fiennes from Red Dragon, just an observation that's all. Jean Reno was also geat as the detective who actually played the role that Dan Brown based on him. Dan Brown admitted that he wrote Reno's character with him in mind. Overall the cast is brilliant and full of great talent that make the characters come alive.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Right now Dan Brown is rolling in it, but in a way I think he justifyingly earned it. The Da Vinci Code is a great, entertaining, and intelligent story, and now Ron Howard has translated it into film which has given us a great story to experience on the silver screen. Great acting and a very detailed story make The Da Vinci Code an entertaining ride all the way to the end. There are times where the editing makes it feel awkward and you can tell there were some problems translating the book to film, but it doesn't detract from the fact that this is a good film. It's not great, but it's not bad. I don't understand the mass hatred from all the film critics so far, I think the film has been attacked harshly for no reason other than it was hyped up to be so much more and didn't deliver on the rediculously high expectations.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Clint Eastwood Masterpiece"></head><body><p>I have seen many fine reviews by perious reviewers so, I'm not going to repeat the great jobs that have already been done. To review the movie, I have to avoid giving away the last third of the movie but, my reference to "thirds" indicates that I have divided the movie into three parts. First, an aspiring female boxer, Margaret Fitzgerald, who is already in her thirties comes to trainer Frankie Dunn, played by Clint Eastwood. She wants him to train her and the first third of the movie governs this evolving relationship. The second part of the movie deals with her boxing career blooming and flourishing. The third part of the movie takes a major turn and the film takes on a much heavier quality.<br /><br />In the first two parts, which I can be more revealing about, the boxer, played by Hilary Swank, shows a grittiness and determination that is much more believable than that displayed in the movie Rocky. Additionally, the fight scenes and progression of her career is also more believable and realistic than in Rocky. Indeed, Rocky seems almost cartoonish compared to this. What really makes this film, however, is the third part which adds a dimension that is nonexistent in Rocky. I cannot reveal the last third of the movie other than to state that it takes a very heavy turn. I must mention, before concluding, that Morgan Freeman, in a supporting role, gives his usual stellar performance. I highly recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

And until the official published work by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785137270">Jemas/Quesada/Jenkins in 2002</a> - was a secret on par with Watergate's Deep Throat in terms of lore and provocation.<br /><br />For regular film fans - that scene is four-and-a-half minutes long. &lt;g><br /><br />Despite enormous reservations, I found myself actually enjoying this latest installment of the X-Men franchise. Infinitely better than the craptacular disaster of 'The Last Stand'. Good grief, I'll watch almost anything but that shyte pile.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman reminds me of Roger Moore. Why? Because like Moore, he found the one role he was born to play - but sadly it will always be that 'one role' for all of film eternity. Certainly Moore has done other good things, '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5N6KW">The Sea Wolves</a>' comes to mind. But there's no escaping the career defining character that he will be forever linked to - you know it without any prompting. And so goes the career of Jackman.<br /><br />Personally never found any of Jackman's performances, with the lone exception of '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC55F2">The Prestige</a>', of any worth or value. His acting has the emotional reach and agility of a tree sloth. Don't even ask about his freakish natural smile. Ugh. But as Wolverine - he absolutely rocks. You would be hard pressed to think of anyone besides him in the role of Mr. Berserker Fury. Pitch perfect, the true embodiment of Len Wein's vision.<br /><br />I'm actually a bit surprised and amused to read some reviews which comment on the comic-level characterizations and plot. Seriously? Some people actually thought this was going to be ... what...'The Godfather' in terms of depth of character and storyline?<br /><br />A fun-filled flick filled with decent-to-spectacular special effects. And a big thumbs up for Jackman's superlative, and always reliable, performance in his career vehicle.<br /><br />One last worthy note: Kevin Durand's Blob. I'm genuinely floored to see him take on this role. Until 'Origin', I could not imagine him doing anything other than big bad stud. So this was a real stretch of his acting muscles, so to speak. A repertoire enhancement for him. Kudos.</p></body></html>

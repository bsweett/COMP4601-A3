<meta name="summary" content="An Even More Ultimate "Ultimate Edition?"  Warner Seeks Another DVD Dip For This 70th Anniversary Tribute"></head><body><p>One of the greatest movies ever and an enduring American classic is back for another DVD go-around!  Say it isn't so.  In 2003, I snapped up the impressive 2-Disc Special Edition DVD.  In 2008, I couldn't resist going Blu-ray with the comprehensive Ultimate Collector's Edition.  I didn't think that a few years later, Warner would be trumpeting an even more advanced collection.  How many times are we expected to dip into the same well?  I mean, I know it's "Casablanca" but when is enough actually enough?  And to use their own terminology, when does ultimate really mean ultimate?  I'm not going to synopsize the film or offer a traditional review, I suspect if you're shopping this pricey new version that you are well aware of the merits of the film itself.  Instead, I will highlight what is included.  Is it worth the upgrade?  That's an individual answer, to be sure, but if you are an enthusiast who owns the Ultimate Collection or a casual viewer that already has the Blu-ray edition--the conclusion might indeed be "no."  If, however, you have yet to go Blu on this title or are a compulsive completist/collector--now may be as good a time as any to pony up the bucks for this limited edition set.<br /><br />Contents:  This box set will be a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack with 3 discs, the third disc being dedicated to three feature length documentaries.  It is a numbered Limited Edition, only 50,000 will be made available.  The double wide display box contains several new collectibles including a 62 page production art book (with never before seen photos, communications, and archived documents about the film), a full size reproduction of the 1942 movie poster, and four drink coasters.  I love this silly collectible stuff, but what is it with coasters in these deluxe sets?<br /><br />Transfer:  Both the DVD and Blu-ray are boasting new 2012 4K transfers.  Arguably, this is the one aspect that might make me seriously recommend an upgrade.  For my money, though, the previous Blu-ray release is extremely satisfying and competent.  It is NOT a transfer that was begging for a polish.<br /><br />NEW Special Features: 2 Documentaries (about 45 minutes of content total):<br />1) Casablanca: An Unlikely Classic<br />2) Michael Curtiz: The Greatest Director You Never Heard Of<br /><br />Feature Length Documentaries On Third Disc (all previously released):<br />1) You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros. Story (2008)<br />2) The Brothers Warner (2008)<br />3) Jack L. Warner: The Last Mogul (1993)<br /><br />OLD Special Features:  Items from the Ultimate Collection will all be carried over.  They include:<br />1) Commentary by Roger Ebert<br />2) Commentary by Rudy Behlmer<br />3) Introduction by Lauren Bacall<br />4) "Now Voyager" Trailer<br />5) Newsreel footage<br />6) Vaudeville Days short<br />7) The Bird Came C.O.D short<br />8) The Squawkin' Hawk short<br />9) The Dover Boys at Pimento University or The Rivals of Roquefort Hall<br />10) Great Performances: Bacall on Bogart<br />11) You Must Remember This: A Tribute to Casablanca<br />12) As Time Goes By: The Children Remember<br />13) Deleted Scenes<br />14) Outtakes<br />15) Who Holds Tomorrow?<br />16) Carrotblanca - Vintage Cartoon<br />17) Scoring Stage Sessions<br />18) 4/26/43 Lady Esther Screen Guild Theater Radio Broadcast<br />19) 11/19/47 Vox Pop Radio Broadcast<br /><br />As you can see, it is a comprehensive list of extras.  All told, there is over 14 hours worth of material, but only about 45 minutes of it is new.  Worth an upgrade?  Probably not if you own the Ultimate, but you won't catch me giving "Casablanca" less than 5 stars.  KGHarris, 2/12.</p></body></html>

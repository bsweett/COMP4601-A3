The Big Lebowski is a film written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. Jeff Bridges stars as Jeff Lebowski who is referred to as "The Dude". This is arguably the most clever movie ever made. This is a fact that is strongly supported by a legion of hardcore dedicated fans world wide. The Big Lebowski is not a cult film - it is the cult film. It has a zen like leisure to it scarcely ever found before or after it came out. You don't have to be a real slacker you can just watch one on television. Aside from all the amazing sensationalism there is a also a great film here as well. The film is loosely based on Raymond Chandler's novel, The Big Sleep. To understand this film I highly recommend you make a couple dozen strong White Russians, sit back, and enjoy. The Dude abides.</p></body></html>

Then the credits roll with music and graphics. A journalist lost a libel suit. [Sloppy research?] Mikal smokes cigarettes [another flaw?] We see Salander the investigator for a businessman who does her research on the Internet. Lisbeth reports on Mikal. Blomkvist gets a telephone call from a lawyer representing Henrik Vanger, who wants to see him at Hedestad. He would research contemptible people - Vanger's family. Can he also solve the disappearance of Harriet Vanger from forty years ago? Vanger offers him proof of Wennerstr&ouml;m's guilt. Mikal will write Vanger's biography, and learns about his relatives living on this island. There are some silent scenes.<br /><br />There is a notebook with 5-digit telephone numbers. Salander is questioned about her work (she has a legal guardian because of her past). She must keep a budget and receipts. Mikal visits a couple for dinner and talks about the past. Elsewhere a thief in the subway tries to steal Lisbeth's bag. Cecilia talks to Mikal about the family. Lisbeth answers questions about her personal life - its regulations. She gets a check after this interview. Mikal flies to London to see Anita and talk about Harriet. Lisbeth visits her guardian at his home. She gets a surprise! [These scenes will not be shown on TV.] Vanger offers to support the `Millenium' magazine. [Do you know how many magazines operate like this?] Mikal looks at old photos. Lisbeth bought a stun gun (are they legal there?). She gets her revenge and a free hand from her lawyer-guardian. Is she insane?<br /><br />Mikal finds something in those old negatives. A chance comment sends him to read Leviticus and its punishment for sinners. Mikal wants a background investigation and meets Lisbeth at her place. He wants help in finding a killer of women. She agrees and does her research. Mikal meets the Vanger family. Lisbeth tells Mikal of her solution to the murders. Is the dead cat a threat? Mikal talks to a widow about her old pictures. Someone takes a shot at Mikal when he is outside. Lisbeth comforts Mikal that night. Mikal wants to inspect old company records, Lisbeth also helps. [Why does a business keep old paper records?] Mikal talks to an old man. Lisbeth correlates a schedule to the murders. [The silent scenes are hard to follow.]<br /><br />Mikal interviews Martin, and is lead to a basement room! The conversation reveals the guilty man, who talks freely about his crimes. Lisbeth arrives just in time to save Mikal. She chases the fleeing murderer who crashes his car. The leaking gasoline explodes, the driver is burned alive (like some medieval punishment). Lisbeth tells her past to Mikal. Martin denied killing Harriet; could she still be alive? They visit Anita in London, who tells them about her past. The mystery is solved, Harriet returns to speak to Henrik Vanger. Lisbeth tells Mikal the secrets of Wennerstr&ouml;m's past; this time the charges will stick. Lisbeth borrows 50,000 for her work. She will repay it as she has the passwords to transfer funds from Wennerstr&ouml;m's banking accounts. Wennerstr&ouml;m is now a hunted man without the money to buy his way out. He is bumped off by his former business associates. Lisbeth returns to her past.<br /><br />This film toned down the original story and improved the character of Lisbeth. It has repulsive characters and some X-rated scenes. This story echoes "The Big Sleep", "Chinatown", and "Roseanna". Can you believe a serial killer living in an isolated location? Most serial killers seek areas with a large transient population for victims. It warns about the Internet (was it designed to allow governmental agencies and others to access your computer?).</p></body></html>

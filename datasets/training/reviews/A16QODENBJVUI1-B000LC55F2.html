<meta name="summary" content="A typical big budget, big name Hollywood period film"></head><body><p>This was a more than decent big budget Hollywood film.  The film struggled with a fundamental problem:  in a film about magicians, you know from the outset that it is going to be a succession of surprises and that nothing is going to turn out to be what it seems.  So, one would have to be a pretty inexperienced filmgoer not to anticipate most or all of the surprises at the end.  I actually figured out the Hugh Jackman side of the surprises pretty early in the film and the Christian Bale side just short of the very end.  So the film suffers from being a film that needs to surprise you to be completely successful, but telegraphing at least 50% of the surprises.<br /><br />What we are left with is a film about revenge and duplicity.  I won't go into the later since it leads to spoilers, but I will say that I rarely if ever enjoy revenge as a major theme in a film.  Two major period films dealing with magicians were released at approximately the same time:  THE PRESTIGE and THE ILLUSIONIST.  I personally enjoyed the latter more than THE PRESTIGE simply because while it also contained a revenge element, it also focused on the possibility of uniting separated lovers.  No such uplifting theme accompanies THE PRESTIGE.  In short, I found it to be something of a downer.  Albeit a highly entertaining downer.<br /><br />Despite these objections I am glad I saw the film.  There is a wonderful period feel to the entire thing and it looked great from beginning to end.  And you can't find a much stronger cast than this one.  Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were superb in their roles at the heart of the picture.  Jackman plays the less gifted magician of the two, but one far more gifted with stage flair and presentation than the rather wooden Bale character.  Michael Caine, who teamed with both Nolan and Bale in BATMAN BEGINS, is as welcome as always.  Scarlet Johansson is certainly a lovely woman, but I would prefer to have seen the highly underrated and under used Piper Perabo in her role (why is Ms. Perabo not a superstar?).  Still, it was nice to see Perabo in a decent role in a major film, playing Jackman's wife early in the film.  David Bowie was effective playing eccentric genius Tesla, though made up in a way to resemble Edward Fox.  Voice over artist Andy Serkis (Golum in the LORD OF THE RING series) plays Tesla's assistant.<br /><br />I definitely recommend the film and I imagine that those not so intent as I was to figure out what the future twists in the film might it enjoy it a lot more than I did.</p></body></html>

Although there were some comedic elements, The Break Up was too shrill and combative to qualify as a romantic comedy. Several scenes were uncomfortable to watch. Jennifer Anniston lacked her usual spark. Vince Vaughn's performance was lackluster.<br /><br />The constant yelling and bickering in this movie are about as enjoyable as the average joe's life in a broken home. There is very little humor here, and what there is is swept under by the constant in-fighting. This movie is not the least bit romantic either. The conclusion of the movie doesn't seem realistic, though I won't give it away. There is very little to praise about this movie.<br /><br />The script was also lacking. I would recommend that you not waste your money on this tripe. If you are looking for a light-hearted, feel-good romantic comedy, The Break-Up is to be avoided.</p></body></html>

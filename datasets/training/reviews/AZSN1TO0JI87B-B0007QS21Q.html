If we were going to have one celebrity run for President, he would be the best choice. I mean, Will Smith is the guy. He has shined through in so many big-budget block-busters in the past, it almost seems like he can make anything work. It's just too bad that up until now, he has been trapped in sequel Hell ("Bad Movie Boys 2" and "Men In Bad Movies 2" are ones that come to mind). "I, Robot," however, is a nice return to fresh form for Smith. It embraces all of the cliches that we've seen in other sci-fi/action movies, but makes it all seem so new and exciting. Smith plays Detective Spooner, caught in the year 2035 where robots and humans live in perfect harmony. The robots serve as servants to the human beings. Seemingly loyal, no one can find a kink in these magnificent machines -- which by the way, are gloriously designed, nice to see something besides "Terminator" clones -- except for, of course, you guessed it, Spooner. He is overly paranoid of these robots, and when the inventor of them is splattered all over the lobby of USR (if you can't guess what it stands for, stop reading) headquarters, Spooner instantly suspects a shady, "unique" robot by the name of Sonny of committing murder. The catch here is that according to the three robot laws, a robot basically cannot harm a human being. And thus, the set-up. The movie moves at a breakneck speed and it's really tough to tell what's coming up next. The action scenes are stunning, as the pace never really lets up. This is one of the few movies in it's genre that keeps the audience guessing. Will Smith is great in his role, and definitely pulls out all the stops with the character. It's nice to see him in such a well-made movie again. Reminds me of the glory days of the first "Men In Black" and "Independence Day," movies that defined popcorn entertainment. Again, a lot of the movie has been done to death in other films, but this does well enough with the material that all is forgiven. The only real flaw I can find is that some key plot-points are difficult to catch, and unless you're watching it at home, where you can rewind, you're likely to get left in the dust. But overall, it's a great movie, with a timeless theme that I think everyone watching can appreciate. It's not the biggest brain-teaser or the most original movie, but it definitely satisfies anyone hungry for some good solid entertainment.</p></body></html>

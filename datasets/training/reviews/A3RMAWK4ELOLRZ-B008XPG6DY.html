<meta name="summary" content="Owen and Aniston are remarkable together!!"></head><body><p>Charles Schine (Clive Owen) is a married man who has an affair with Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston), a woman he meets on a train, who is also married.  The two of them go to a hotel room and start making love, when a guy comes bursting in the door demanding the two of their wallets.  Later on, we find out the guy's name was Philippe LaRoche (Vincent Cassel).  To Charles' wife (Melissa George) and their daughter Amy, Philippe is just a guy who works with him.  But behind closed doors, Philippe wants Charles' money.  In order to protect his and Lucinda's family, Charles has to do exactly what Philippe says.<br /><br />This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.  I wasn't expecting what happened to happen.  The film started off slow, and then it picked up.  The ending will shock you like it did for me.  Derailed is worth a watch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="There Will Be Blood"></head><body><p>'There Will Be Blood' brings us Daniel Day-Lewis in a masterly performance following the life of an oil prospector and the relationships he forges and ruins. Some of the first things to strike me were how this film is beautifully directed with marvelous use of light and shadow and how the soundtrack helps keep things on edge with various percussive elements and discordant notes. But the key to this film really is Day-Lewis' performance and the whole film rests on his portrayal of Daniel Plainview, never has a film rested so strongly on one actors supreme work. This film doesn't have any real resolution, although some parts are tied up, but this looks at the overall life of this brutal and savage man as he exploits both community and nature for his gains in oil. At 2 and 1/2 hours it did begin to feel a touch long towards the end, but Day-Lewis manages to hold you captivated by his rich and in-depth performance and keeps you watching until the very end. The supporting actors play their roles well and Plainviews son was especially note-worthy. A dark tale, in both content and execution, but one that should be watched at least once to soak up it's atmosphere, acting and beautiful direction.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

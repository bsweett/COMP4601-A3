In both cases some older guys show today's younger action heroes how it is supposed to be done.<br /><br />Sorry but Bourne holds no candle to Stallone and Neeson in these 2 films.<br /><br />But both TAKEN and RAMBO are more than just action movies... they also have a message about our world today.<br /><br />There is a difference between IDEALISM and REALISM and ignorance is not bliss.<br /><br />Especially in America today Political Correctness seems to have made a large part of our population oblivious to the fact that real evil exists in the world and has to be dealt with.  Instead we have too many people turning a blind eye to so many bad trends and warning signs developing in our changing culture but they choose to stick their heads in the sand and think "everything will be OK, people are inherently good".<br /><br />With RAMBO it was the well intentioned missionaries who could not believe they would run into problems in Burma (But Rambo knew better).<br /><br />With TAKEN it is the naive, socially liberal family that thinks they can travel the world without a care (But Neeson's character knows better).<br /><br />In both films, our central character has to rescue our idealistic, naive victims from the harsh realities that truly exist in the world.<br /><br />I wonder how many viewers of these movies get the underlying message and how many only see these as tough guy action films ?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="When plants attack"></head><body><p>There are forces at work beyond our understanding, like those behind the casting director's ability to get any semi-competent actor to take part in this garbage.  Another unexplained force would be, considering the last good movie he made was Sixth Sense, M Night Shyamalan's popularity.  With enough pseudo-science about plant-life having self-preservation mechanism, and the ability to launch airborne neurotoxins from their spores, or something like that, this movie may as well have been the sequel to The Inconvenient Truth.<br /><br />Poor speech and disorientation are the first signs of this floral terrorist attack, meaning Bobcat Goldwaithe and drunks walking out of bars would be in serious danger.  A decent cast with Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel, as Elliot and Alma Moore, is the only reason to watch this film.  Given nearly nothing script-wise by writer/director M. Night, the acting is nonetheless very intense.  Seriously, the script is the stuff of bar napkins.  Better yet, graffiti scribblings on toilet walls.  If not for a series of shocking suicides, which are, admittedly, jaw-dropping, the movie serves as nothing more than environmental mumbo-jumbo.  If Shyamalan wanted to make plants and wind scary (which they absolutely weren't in this film), he should have taken a page from The Ruins or The Wizard of Oz, respectively.<br /><br />Ten reasons this movie sucks (there could easily be more):<br />1) The man vs. lion scene is atrociously done, so fake I gave myself a migraine when I rolled my eyes.<br />2) Suspense requires, well, suspense.  Telling the surprise ending at the beginning is stupid.  Why not just show Bruce Willis as a ghost in the first scene of The Sixth Sense?<br />3) When there is a lovelorn subplot involving the two main characters of the film, and it's given absolutely no depth, it should be left on the cutting-room floor.<br />4) When a train stops in the upper NE of the U.S., the reason given is that they've lost contact with, "everyone."  Given that the effects of this "outbreak" only attacked the same region, why would they stop when they could easily contact the rest of America, let alone the rest of the world.<br />5) People can't outrun the wind.<br />6) When escaping from the wind, it's wise to know that old houses have very poor insulation<br />7) The over-the-top preaching about humans destroying the planet is insufferable.  I'm going to drive my SUV through a wheat field just to spite Shyamalan.<br />8) The psychotic, reclusive yokel Mrs. Jones is a pointless addition, and if anything, should have been spared by the film's "logic."<br />9) Pointless plot insertions like a communications pipe between Mrs. Jones main house and a shed outback is sloppily inserted just for future use later.  The same goes for everyone in the film with a gun.<br />10) Aside from constantly being in the running for Razzies, this film has the distinct pleasure of easily having one of the worst ten endings in cinema history.</p></body></html>

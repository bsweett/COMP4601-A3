It's almost as good as seeing the film for the first time.<br /><br />Yes, some scenes have a lot of grain. SO WHAT. The beautiful details of the miniature sets and Dor&eacute;-inspired backgrounds are visible in a way they never quite were before. Technical inadequacies are also more-visible, most-notably unstable matte lines.<br /><br />The supplemental material is above-average, including two hours' worth of material on the film's gestation and production. All the work Obie did for "Creation" is included, in beautiful HD transfers.<br /><br />But the very best supplement is the lost spider-pit sequence. I watched it before anything else, thinking "They've finally found it!" But they hadn't. Peter Jackson studied the highly detailed script and came up with a plausible story board. The monsters were created, the sequence animated, and then "downgraded" to look like a 1933 film. The illusion is perfect. And it's infinitely better than Jackson's excessive and overwrought take on the scene for his unnecessary and pointless remake.<br /><br />My only gripe is that "Son of Kong", a charming and unassuming sequel, is not included. But the disk is so stuffed with material there probably wasn't enough room.<br /><br />Recommended without hesitation. A necessary addition to any film-lover's Blu-ray library.</p></body></html>

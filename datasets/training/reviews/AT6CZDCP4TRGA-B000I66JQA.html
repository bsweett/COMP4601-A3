<meta name="summary" content="Complex, quietly subversive and ballsy"></head><body><p>This is one film that richly deserved its critical accolades, definitely worth owning, or at least repeated viewings.<p>The characters are nuanced, with multiple and conflicting drives---not the tidy and simplistic cardboard-cutouts Hollywood usually comes up with.  The three women---Streep, Moore, and Kidman---are flawlessly directed and lead three vaguely connected, but very parallel lives.  Streep and Moore's characters reminded me of so, so many women I've known, both friends and family: women who maintain a happy facade (Streep as a dynamic, cheerful socialite and Moore as a placid suburbian housewife) behind which they are desperately empty, sad, and unfulfilled.  <p>Nicole Kidman puts in the finest performance of her career---I never would've expected it, given the usually vacuous roles she plays, but her Virginia Woolf is nothing short of amazing.  You can just feel the towering genius and passion behind the eerie, unhinged exterior.  Devoid of makeup and hair coloring, and wearing a bigger prosthetic nose, she actually looks a million times more attractive, and more human, than her usual generic-glam-blonde getup.  <p>Woolf's suicide was a courageous refusal to live a life (in her case, one of chronic mental illness) that she didn't want, could not change and could not otherwise escape.  Ed Harris's character also chooses suicide, rather than watch himself die slowly from AIDS.  For them, suicide is the only remaining gateway to freedoom and wholeness.  <p>Moore's character finds the only alternative to suicide is to desert her husband and children.  Only Streep's character dangles in the middle, mired in the same deep, gnawing and nameless discontent but not yet having found a way out.  <p>What many viewers may find deeply disturbing is the subtext that true existential FREEDOM---a beaten-to-death buzzword after 9/11---is not only very precious but very elusive.  Why?  Because most of us do not pass the crucible, are simply not willing to pay the REAL price of freedom: leaving behind everything that chains us down.  Even if that means killing yourself, or walking out on your family, or coming out of the closet.  Unwilling to let go of our lives, we become trapped in the misery of this clinging cowardice, we become prisoners who can only sit and wait for Death to come and get us, counting the hours dragging by.  <p>And Phillip Glass's magnificent score keeps everything moving along crisply, despite the film's title.</p></body></html>

Casino is such a great movie, with a terrific cast, that it's over before you know it. Watching the film makes you realize how great De Niro, Pesci and Stone are as actors. There are just many great scenes where I sat there and thought how brilliant they were. The best scenes are with the dialogue between De and Stone. It is just intersting to watch how just about one arguement can ruin everything for people and causes everyone on top to hit rock bottom. Fanastic acting, I can't say that enough because that is what makes the movie.The movie also does a great job making itself modern even though it takes place during the 70s and 80s. If you are into great films, this one of the best.</p></body></html>

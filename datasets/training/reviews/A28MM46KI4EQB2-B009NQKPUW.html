After that, I'd say I enjoyed Prometheus even a bit better than the 3rd & 4th Alien movies.  It was cool to finally witness how the xenomorphs inevitably came to be...and I must say that this movie was pretty intense, as it should be!<br /><br />I have never honestly read the book, so I don't pretend to know how close the movie actually comes to it in comparison, but I've never been a big reader anyway...there are books I do like and will read, but my taste in sci-fi literature is pretty limited.  However, I love sci-fi movies!<br /><br />All of the actors in this movie did a great job I felt.  I had only ever previously seen Noomi Rapace in Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows, in which I felt she did very good, so I had no doubt she'd be good in this movie.  Then there is, of course, the ever awesome Michael Fassbender...I have liked him as an actor ever since Centurion, though his best role in my opinion so far has been the younger Magneto in X-Men First Class.  There was also the always cool Idris Elba and Charlize Theron.<br /><br />What it boils down to if this...if you enjoy good sci-fi, especially if you're familiar with the Alien movies (which any sci-fi love probably is), then I highly recommend giving this movie a watch.  I for one will be adding this to my collection once it releases!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A thoughtful movie about the birth of heroes"></head><body><p>How are heroes born? What if the hero doesn't know he's a hero? What role does evil place in the birth of good? More importantly, can a heroic type of good exist without an equally strong, deep evil to fight against? All these themes have been explored for decades by comic book writers and artists. But I don't think any movie has fully explored the dark reality of superheroes and villians (and their identity crises) as well as Unbreakable. Yes, as many have complained, this movie has a dark, brooding side and it moves rather slowly. But I'd argue that is only fitting for a movie which explores two men (portrayed by Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson) who haven't realized who they are and what parts they play in each others' lives - not to mention the world at large. Only when they meet each other do they begin to fulfill their destinies. Until then, they are rather lost and a certain somberness seems appropriate. If you pay close attention, however, you'll notice that the serious, dark colors at the beginning of the movie change to lighter, brighter colors. And do keep your eye on the colors in each scene; they lead the way to even greater revelations. I will warn you that this movie is NOT for those who want constant action and thrills. This one forces you to think and it often goes rather slowly, giving the viewer a chance to fully appreciate every detail. I plan to watch it again and again.</p></body></html>

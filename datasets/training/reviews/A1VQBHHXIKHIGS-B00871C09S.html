To the extent that I never watched any of his movies, if you can believe it. Well, this one's pretty damn cool. I really don't want to overanalyze all the techniques that our beloved director employed so well, lest I spoil the fun. The plot centers around a question. Did Raymond Burr kill his wife and chop her up with saw and knife? That's the impression injured Jimmy Stewart got from peeping through the windows. We had to throw in some subplots and have some fun as well, because of the length, and it's excellent in doing that. Almost everybody sends up himself or herself a little bit, and we have some laughs in addition to trademark suspense, and it's a great film.</p></body></html>

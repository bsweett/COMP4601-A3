<meta name="summary" content="2 and 1/2 stars. I really wanted to like this..but it just wasn't for me."></head><body><p>I was excited about this movie when I first heard about it. I really like the Blade movies and the plot seemed realy cool. I was expecting a unique and god story and some awesome action and special effects. Well....<br /><br />The movie is about an ongoing battle between vampires and their arch enemies, werewolves. But, crossed between this fight is a vampire that falls for a werewolve. The movie has a neat and cool opening fight and then... Well, the movie's plot started to bore me and there was too much talking. It was a pretty boring movie and I found myself dozing off at times. Also, Kate Beckinsale fires her uzi guns like 5000000000000 times before finally reloading. How many bullets does it hold? And also, she seems to fire a lot but hits mostly the walls. Also, the fights weren't very exhilirating. And it would have been really cool if the vampires would have like jumped off walls to dodge the werewolves but no.. The final scene is fun and cool but I had to wait through a lot of boring stuff and just useless scenes. And the fights weren't cool like Blade's, they were just a little dissapointing.<br /><br />But, it's an ok rent with some good special effects, a couple good fights and a good conclusion.</p></body></html>

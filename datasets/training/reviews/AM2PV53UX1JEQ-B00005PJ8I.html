Tom Hanks again proves his acting chops in this very imaginative psychological adventure tale; from the moment he is in the plane until he is rescued, this is one magnetically charged movie, and in ways you might not expect.  The plane crash itself jolts your senses; it is that kind of big-screen sequence in which you lose all sense of time and place and are in the movie; Cast Away remains that way throughout the entire sequence on the island.  The ocean waves themselves become characters, and their incessant pounding on the surf takes on a horrific quality, even in its natural beauty. But as sure-footed as this movie is when Tom is &quot;cast away&quot;, it is disheartening to report that the final half hour or so, featuring an uninteresting Helen Hunt, robs us of the very buildup we've been mesmerized by for over 90 minutes.  And the bookend plot device simply does not give us what we want after having endured so much.  Still, you will not likely see a more creatively charged big-budget movie this season, nor a performance as riveting at Hanks'.  The device of Wilson the volleyball as Hanks' only &quot;friend&quot; is brilliantly executed, with an emotional payoff as surprising as it is deftly handled.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An absolutely first rate sea yarn"></head><body><p>This isn't quite an updating of MOBY DICK.  It lacks the metaphysical and religious elements, but just as Ahab is pursing his white whale, so does Capt. &quot;Lucky&quot; Jack Aubrey pursue the French fighting ship Acheron, which is larger, better gunned, and faster than his own H.M.S. Surprise.  This is not a deep movie.  It is not, like THE LORD OF THE RINGS, a morality tale.  It is simply an adventure yarn, but as such, it is one of the most satisfying I have seen in a long while.  The movie stars Russell Crowe as Aubrey, and while this isn't one of the more challenging roles he has played, he did his usual stellar job.  Paul Bettany has the second lead as Aubrey's close friend, classical music partner, and ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin.  The rest of the cast (including Billy Boyd who I saw earlier today as Pippin in RETURN OF THE KING) is uniformly excellent and makes a fine ensemble cast.  There is one other costar, and that is the ship used to portray the H.M.S. Surprise.  They really went all out in making a perfect recreation of a late 18th century frigate.  I kept thinking about the gigantic number of ropes that seemed to be required to make the ship functional.  <p>This is a chase movie.  There is little or no preface and build up to the action.  We are immediately told that the assignment for the Surprise is to find and capture or sink the French ship the Acheron.  The rest of the film consists either the two ships engaging one another, or the Surprise chasing the Acheron.  The substance of the film beyond that consists entirely of the relations between the various members of the crew, with the exception of a trip to the Galapagos Islands, where Maturin, as a naturalist, gets to glimpse the animals that Charles Darwin would make so much of only a couple of decades later on the Beagle.  Apart from some TV documentaries, this is the only movie I can ever remember having seen that was actually shot on location in the Galapagos Islands, and it was, moreover, the only parts of the film shot on dry land.<p>Some serious film buffs might turn their noses up at this film, because it doesn't try to do anything but entertain, but it does that so well, that I would suggest that they think about nose jobs.</p></body></html>

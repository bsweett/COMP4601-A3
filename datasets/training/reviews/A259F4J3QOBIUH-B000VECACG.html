Each DVD contains a different version of the movie, and the Chart describes the changes (additions or edits) in each version of the film.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I recommend the Director's cut.  Watching this sort of thing and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UZDO5I">The X-Files: The Ultimate Collection</a> makes me feel better about real experiences.  Watching some other poor bastard go through it is much better.<br /><br />For those of you who live in the city, get away from the light pollution for a while.  You'll appreciate this special edition boxed set even more.<br />Regardless, this movie set is fantastic, and the special effects are terrific.  I had never seen the movie, until I purchased this set.  Recently, I enjoyed the film, and I recommend this edition.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly entertaining"></head><body><p>I must confess: I don't care for Will Farrel. Watching him on Saturday Night Live was like taking a cheese grater to my hand. This was the first movie of his that I saw, and I did so only because my roommate assured me that it was warm and entertaining.<br /><br />From the very beginning, with Bob Newhart's understated delivery, and the intriguing imagery that followed as the beginning credits rolled accompanied by warm Christmas music, I knew that he was right. Elf was going to be something special.<br /><br />The concept of a human being raised by elves at the North Pole is an intriguing and original one, as far as I'm aware. So the movie gets credit for that. At some point, of course, the "misfit" who can't fit into his bed, and can barely get into the bathroom, needs to find his real family. So, by himself (and this is slightly unrealistic - wouldn't he be accompanied by someone or something: New York isn't a place for an adult child who thinks he's an elf; in the "real" world, he would have been dead in an hour) he seeks out his real father. Who, as it happens, is on the "naughty list".<br /><br />His father, as it turns out, works in children's book publishing. I can not for the life of me imagine a more innappropriate job for that man to hold. He's callous, unkind, doesn't seem to be interested in children - and those aren't qualities that lend well to the creation of children's books. Nevertheless...it is a good fit for the ending.<br /><br />Farrell pulls off the innocent elf gig pretty well. Despite some uncomfortable moments (him dancing on a table on the mail room - that was a bit over the top), his performance was believable. Less believable was the pretty blonde girl falling for him, but we are being asked to suspend disbelief, and I think we can do so with that.<br /><br />I'm not sure that I'd watch it over and over, and I wouldn't say that it has found its place in the canon of Christmas classics, but I would watch it again, and it is a decent Christmas film.<br /><br />However, I'm probably wrong. It will probably be played on television every Christmas for the next fifty years.</p></body></html>

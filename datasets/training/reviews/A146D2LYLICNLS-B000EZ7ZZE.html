<meta name="summary" content="A carbon-copy of the first movie...what's the point?"></head><body><p>I've never claimed to be an expert on movie-making. Having said that, I think it's fair to say that a movie sequel should have at least *something* that distinguishes it from the first one. Something that spices up the overall story and yet maintains a continuity. Well, you won't see that with "Resident Evil: Apocalypse." Alexander Witt sat in the director's chair for this one, but he may as well change his name to Paul Anderson, because this movie is basically a recycled, watered-down pointless sequel to the first one. Witt brings absolutely nothing new to the table. This might as well just be an hour and a half long prologue to "Resident Evil." Judged on its own merits, this one sinks faster than a ball of lead thrown in a river.<br /><br />To begin with, just about every cliche in the book is thrown into the mix, including the obligatory multi-racial cast, which of course wouldn't be complete without the loudmouth, wise-cracking nimrod whose only purpose is to provide comic relief. And poorly-timed comic relief, I might add. The script is so atrocious that one could probably follow the entire movie with zero dialogue spoken. And oh yeah, there are plenty of profanities just to make it more "hip." Action sequences are forced and cliched, and pretty much all of them are shown in the trailer. This movie has no flow whatsoever; it's one "shoot 'em up" scene after another. After the millionth zombie shot in the head it gets old real quick. The so-called "scary" scenes are more laughable than frightening. You can see them coming a million miles away. It's not a good sign when the audience is one step ahead of the movie. Many scenes were just flat-out sickening, such as the zombie corpse with worms crawling all over its face. Cheap shock value. And don't even get me started on the "Nemesis" monster. But hey, one good thing was that the guy inside that Halloween rubber suit could at least hide his face and not let anyone know he starred in this movie. I could go on but I think you get the point.<br /><br />For me, the only enjoyable thing was seeing Milla Jovovich, whom I worship. She's perfect in her role as Alice. But as much as I love you Milla, even you couldn't save it.<br /><br />Bottom line: "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" is an overly-loud, pointless, cliched, virtually plotless, poorly directed carbon-copy of the first movie, and at least the first one had its moments. Now, I'm a movie-goer who's able to have realistic expectations when walking into the theater. The "Resident Evil" movies are based on a video game for teenagers, so I'm not expecting "Citizen Kane." But come on, there's nothing wrong with having at least SOME iota of intelligence in a movie of this genre. A total waste of time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Armageddon from Deep Inside of the Earth; So-so Sci-fi Film"></head><body><p>"The Core" is nothing but fun, I know, but as the cast is very  impressive and the company is Hollywood major studio Paramount Pictures (the one renowned for "Star Trek" series), I expected pretty much from the film.  This sci-fi film is not so bad as critics might find.  Only too familiar, that is the problem.<p>The opening part is very effectively spooky, thanks to the director Jon Amiel ("Copycat").  Strange things start to happen all over the world -- one of them is re-enactment of Hitchcock nightmare -- and scientists are assembled to investigate the case.  The truth behind the disasters turns out something not very encouraging; the inner core of the earth has stopped moving, and the world as we know is to meet the end very soon.<p>So the story starts well, but soon becomes something very familiar, like the updated fashion of "The Jorney to the Center of the World."  The scientific theory is replaced by the uninspired ideas, and when the crew of the subterranean ship "Virgil" is gathered, we know that instead of Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck, we see such faces as Hilary Swank, Aaron Eckhart, Delroy Lindo, Tcheky Karyo, Stanley Tucci, and Bruce Greenwood (whose previous film was most appropriately the submarime film "Below".)  Well, the cast is not bad, though.<p>Nevertheless, the film gradually shows the lack of any kind of  originality, and if you have seen "Armageddon" or "Deep Impact," you can predict every twist in the storyline.  Sure, somebody must go, and during the comparatively long running time of the film, some cities must go, too.  The underground scenes are realized pretty good CGIs, but you cannot deny the fact that those scenes also somehow betray the limits of our imagimation, while we are looking closely at them.  Because no one has ever seen the core of the earth, the visuals have to rely on our own creativity.  So, I thought, these images could have been much more surprising and even wilder, but strangely, the visuals look as if telling the film takes itself too seriously.  <p>The main trouble with the film is not, however, those parts.  The cast, especially Swank and Eckhart both talented professionals, look miscast in the role they are playing.  They look neither enthusiastic nor cool as the hero and heroine of the film which requires the wit of Indie Jones or the dedication of Ripley.  Only Stanley Tucci convinces us as the pompous doctor, breathing life into cardboard character. And "The Core" uses some ideas that might make you sigh at some points, and some players are typecast.  See, for example, D.J. Qualls (the geeky guy in "Road Trip") cast as a computer wiz.  I guess he deserves much different types of roles, but the studio would probably listen.  <p>Corny and predictable, but as an updated B disaster film "The Core" ends up so-so.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Classic Horror At Its Best!"></head><body><p>In space, no one can hear you scream, but unfortuneately, my wife heard me loud and clear as I screamed across my living room when watching this. The film is set in space, where 7 people aboard a spacecraft have seemingly drifted off into another galaxy. They bring aboard a baby alien, which proceeds to wreak havoc on the entire crew. I couldn't eat for awhile when I saw an alien pop out of a chest, and I couldn't sleep picturing the terrifying alien's face staring at me. This my friends, is horror at its best, and this was a very influential movie that others followed with alien flick after alien flick.</p></body></html>

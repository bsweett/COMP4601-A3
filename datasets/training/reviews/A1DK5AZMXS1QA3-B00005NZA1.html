Some might call it a drama, as the slow pacing, muted emotions, lack of comedy, and modern, urban setting all fit the descriptions of many modern dramas.  Some might call it a fantasy; a reluctant superhero discovered by his arch-enemy who knows no bounds.  The former has strength beyond his knowledge, while the latter uses cunning to overcome his physical limitations.  Others might call it a suspense movie, as it has all the hallmarks of a classic suspense; good guys and bad guys are only sorted out at the end, and the audience discovers things as the protagonist does.  Maybe it is a combination of all three genres, another achievement from the M. Knight Shamalayan.<br /><br />However one might classify this movie, it is an incredible piece of story-telling.  Its as if Shamalayan wrote a traditional fairy tale, set it in a modern American city, and then reversed all the normal rules of fairy tales.  First of, the premise of superhero ignorant of his own destiny is a common starting point; think of Harry Potter, X-Men, and Frodo Baggins in Lord of the Rings.  But the heroes in these stories are all young, at the beginning of their lives.  Bruce Willis's character here, David, is old, past middle age most likely, and looking back on his glory years.  Second, heroes needs to be revealed unintentionally, through accident or fate.  David is discovered by both accident and fate.  Accident put him on a train, but fate assured him to survive.  Third, each hero needs a weakness.  Superman had kryptonite, Batman had his past and Spiderman has his loved ones.  But water, who would ever imagine water to be the one weakness of David?  Last, all heroes need an antagonist, that villian they must stop.  But here, it is the villian who seeks out the hero, helps him find his power, and finally, guarantees the hero's victory by sealing his own doom.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great movie.  For the budget it was made one, with the cast it starred, it delivers a great story with heart and soul.  Its setting is modern, yet the storyline is more mythical than anything else.  The conceptual background of comicbooks contrasts nicely with the plot itself.  I highly recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

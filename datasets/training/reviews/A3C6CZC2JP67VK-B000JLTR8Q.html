His earlier works have been very cynical, and sometimes dark which I had fun watching. This film, in the other hand, ventures away from that and the characters are in a dissimilar light. M. Night somehow made a movie that is compatible with children, and just as compatible with the adult. The humor doesn't lose its touch halfway through the movie, and in some respects the humor adds to the sadness.  The opening tells us that this is a children's story, pretty much about good vs. evil and visually suggests that the people from the water are like angels.<br /><br />The whole plot is laid out right there; the depiction of it in character, in dialog, in camera shots, is compelling to the very end. The casts, mostly whom are less character-driven but are caricatures on the screen, gave good performances. The acting by Paul Giamati and Bryce Dallas Howard were true to their roles. M. Night Shyamalan appearances are always appealing to me. I even like how he summarily dealt with critics but after watching this I have clearly seen that this wasn't his best efforts.<br /><br />The soundtrack explodes when it needs to and whispers when it doesn't. Night is wise to employ Christopher Doyle (2046, Infernal Affairs, In The Mood For Love) as the cinematographer. Doyle is a genuine architect of angles, mood and atmosphere when it comes to hand-held cameras. For me, this movie is a painting and Night is the painter. We, as viewers, can never understand an artist. So did the people at Disney, who rejected his sixth drafted script. Probably in 1000 years from now someone is going to write THE SHYAMALAN CODE and make big bucks out of the novel.<br /><br />And that's the twist!</p></body></html>

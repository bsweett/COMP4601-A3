It is a story of a seemingly ordinary man who became extraordinary. The film is complexly made and is one of the very few most beautiful and breathtaking pictures made. Lawrence of Arabia far engulfs the epic films such as Gone with the Wind and Ben-Hur. The supporting cast gives extremely good performances.<br /><br />12/07: Lawrence of Arabia is undoubtedly a masterpiece, and it's among David Lean's best. Everything about Lawrence of Arabia speaks of volumes when it comes to epic pictures. It's actually meets the standard of epic pictures that Ben-Hur had set forth. The acting is excellent, the cinematography is resplendent, and the costumes are impressive. I am pleased with the use of hundreds of extras to make Lawrence of Arabia bigger than it seems. Peter O'Toole, in his debut, makes waves with his perfection of T.E. Lawrence, a character that is complicated and different. Not only he is an unusual kind of a hero, T.E. Lawrence is a dynamic person. Omar Sharif, who plays Sherif Ali, does a wonderful job in counterbalancing Lawrence. Anthony Quinn, playing Auda abu Tayi, brings momentum to the film through his characters. Alec Guiness, as Prince Feisal, performs just like how a king would. One of the most remarkable jobs that David Lean does with his characters in Lawrence of Arabia is not only to make them indirect but mysterious in terms of ambitions and wants. That's why Lawrence of Arabia remains a difficult picture to comprehend. And that is also why I keep re-visiting the picture from time to time. Having said that, Lawrence of Arabia is one of the most thrilling, beautiful pictures I've seen. How could I not forget that transition from one scene of T.E. Lawrence surrendering his destiny to next scene of men cheering and chanting his name loudly? That has to be very moving for anyone to see that. Seemingly ordinary, T.E. Lawrence is an extraordinary person; he doesn't even pass for a leader yet he can lead a country that isn't even his country. He is the kind of a person that Che Guevara aspired to be and never succeeded at being one. There have been many revolutionary leaders over the course of time, and T.E. Lawrence belongs in that upper echelon of the list. Living today in the year of 2007, Lawrence of Arabia sadly remains a lost art and is a true motion picture experience. To think of the film less than magnificent is a travesty. Ironically as Lawrence of Arabia is almost four hours long, I just wish it was doubled. As one would say, "Forget the length. Feel the quality." Indeed so!<br /><br />7/11: Lawrence of Arabia is simply one of the greatest movies made. I watch it all the time, and I never get tired of the beautiful cinematography. There are so many hidden meanings within the picture that I learn something new each time. All in all, a masterpiece.</p></body></html>

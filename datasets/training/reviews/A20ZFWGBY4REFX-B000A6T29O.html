<meta name="summary" content="Angelina Jolie is the best Lara Croft ever!!"></head><body><p>I was a really big fan of the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; phenomenon when the whole thing began on PlayStation and PC, and I knew that there was going to be a movie someday, it was just the matter of when they are going to release it. Now comes the hard part...who will be Lara Croft?! Well, I always thought that either Sandra Bullock, Elizabeth Hurley, and even Demi Moore would be among the lucky ones to play Lara. But when Angelina Jolie secured the part, man, was I going to get a real kick out of this!! When I finally saw it in the theaters, I thought that the movie was great! I loved how Angelina flew up to her chandelier on her bungee cord and the way she shoots both her guns at the same time, now that's something that the skills of an expert can handle! And now, I have the DVD of &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot;, and I love all the extras that are jam packed into the DVD, such as the U2 music video, deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, cast and crew interviews, and much more! In closing, I would just like to say that Angelina Jolie is quite frankly the absolute best Lara Croft around. And &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; is possibly one of Angelina Jolie's best films since &quot;Gia&quot;, &quot;Hackers&quot;, and &quot;The Bone Collector&quot;. This is more fun than playing the video games of this!!</p></body></html>

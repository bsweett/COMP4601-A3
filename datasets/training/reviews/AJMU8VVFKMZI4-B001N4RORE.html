There are maybe two songs that faired an okay from me-the rest I was cringing every time the actors opened their mouths.  I love Meryl and I doubt that I'll ever be able to prop her back on the pedestal I had her on after this.  This is bad.  This is a very bad film and I couldn't dare recommend this to my worst enemy.</p></body></html>

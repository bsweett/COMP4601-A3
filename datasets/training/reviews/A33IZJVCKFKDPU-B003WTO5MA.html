<meta name="summary" content="Spooky Remake of a Good Horror Story"></head><body><p>Nobody really knows what happened on 12 Ocean Ave. in Amityville, NY in 1974.  The movie starts out with one of Hollywood's greatest tags "Based on a True Story."  The fact is that Ronald DaFoe did murder his family, blaming voices from the house for his actions and the Lutz's did move into the house one year later, but after that its all a fuzz.  But regardless of whether or not the events in the story are true, one thing is for certain: it makes for one hell of a spooky tale.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier the story is about the Lutz family and their 28 days living in a haunted house.  They decide to move into their dream house in Amityville, Long Island becasue it was being sold at a killer price (no pun intended).  They learn that the previous residents were all brutally murdered, but the price and the house were too good to pass up.  After they move into the house George (Ryan Reynolds) starts to feel different.  He starts hearing voices in the house and starts to see ghosts.  Slowly the voices start to posses him.  They convince him that his family are all demons and slowly over the 28 day span, he starts to go crazy.  This eventually leads up to him attempting to kill his family.<br /><br />There were some good things in this movie.  First was Ryan Reynolds performance of George Lutz.  I was a little hesitant about accepting him in a serious role, but he managed to pull of a very powerful, emotional role.  Also he convinced me that he was really going crazy.  The other actors do a fine job as well.  I also like the re-creation of the Amityville Haunted House.  The house itself creates a really spooky atmosphere.  Lastly, I liked the fact that the movie was just plain creepy.  There are a lot of scenes that make you jump, but the atmosphere of the movie never really lets the viewer feel comfortable.<br /><br />So I would recommend seeing this movie.  Its enough to hold you off until the summer movie season starts and it is good for a few scares.  Whether you believe that the story is real or not is up to you, but you should definately watch to see whether you believe in ghost stories like this or not.</p></body></html>

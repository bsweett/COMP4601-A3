<meta name="summary" content="The number one animated classic of  2009 gets the 4-disc Blu-ray treatment!"></head><body><p>What a great animated film from the folks at Disney/Pixar. This is a beautifully animated film that has lots of emotion, wit and charm. Disney is on a ball here, last year with Wall-E and this year the equally stellar "Up". This incredible 4-disc set has two blu-ray's dedicated to the film itself, a DVD, and a digital copy for "Up" on the go! The PQ, sound and extras are awesome. This film will be winning some awards come Golden Globe and Oscar time. Two "ballons" up! A+</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nice Try, But Watch the Original First"></head><body><p>Though it lacks the quiet dignity of the original, Jonathan Demme's talky update of "The Manchurian Candidate" manages to hit enough points to qualify as a watchable thriller.  The story, of course, has been updated beyond its Cold War roots, meaning the communists aren't the villains anymore.  (I won't tell you who they are, but aside from Nazis, who is a villain of convenience nowadays?)  That also means that the plot is needlessly top heavy with details and machinations, turning a story that originally was chilling in its simplicity into something cumbersome, as well as more brooding than frightening.<br /><br />Likable Denzel Washington steps into Frank Sinatra's venerable shoes as Ben Marco, the Army major unfortunate enough to have his squad turned into diabolical experiments in mind control.  This time, he isn't suffering only from nightmares but from what seems the worst case of Gulf War Syndrome on record.  Lacking the pathos of Lawrence Harvey, Liev Schreiber makes for a reptilian Raymond Shaw, the soldier at the center of what may be a fantastic assassination plot, only this time, he's a senator with designs on the White House.  (This script jettisons the Johnny Iselin character, thus robbing the movie of some of the original's bitingly satirical moments; it also maddeningly reduces Shaw's near redemptive romance with a political opponent's daughter to an expository footnote and trades the functions of some characters.)  But perhaps the biggest flaw is Meryl Streep's generally histrionic approach to the role of Raymond's mother.  As acclaimed an actress as she is, Streep's portrayal seems a burlesque of Angela Lansbury's stunning foray into villainy.<br /><br />Demme's direction is less taut than in "Silence of the Lambs" and showier but often less effective than John Frankenheimer's - oddly enough, some deleted scenes show a better grasp of the concept than what made it into the theatrical version.  The original, an almost perfect film, remains the definitive version.</p></body></html>

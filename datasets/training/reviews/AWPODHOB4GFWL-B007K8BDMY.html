Knowing from the start that the very animal he loves will kill Timothy Treadwell takes nothing from the impact of this film.  Treadwell's affection for grizzlies is simple and direct and he takes enormous pride in `protecting' these enormous creatures.  It isn't just that the film shots are simply amazing, but Treadwell has interjected many of his personal thoughts on his life and the world throughout the film, which Herzog carefully edits.  He states many times that he would rather be killed by a grizzly than to have one killed - a prophetic statement.<br /><br />There are tender and heartbreaking interviews with family and friends.  One learns as much about Timothy Treadwell's life as we do the bears.  Certainly Treadwell was a na?ve idealist, but he was able to overcome drug and alcohol abuse as well as the disappointment of coming close to acting fame.  He finally realized his calling in life and lives it fully to the end.  The combination of Treadwell's child-like irresponsibility and Herzog's vision of life as chaotic reality makes for a mesmerizing documentary.  It is beautiful and gut wrenching.</p></body></html>

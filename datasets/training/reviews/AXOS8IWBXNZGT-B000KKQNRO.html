Witness the biggest cover-up in human history.""></head><body><p>Today I went to watch the Ron Howard movie The Da Vinci Code, a film based upon the novel of the same name. It stars Tom Hanks, whom you may remember from previous Ron Howard films, and Audrey Tautou, best known for her work in Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain. Also making an appearance: Sir Ian Mckellen, Jean Reno, Paul Bettany, and Alfred Molina, amongst others....plus, the Louvre and its art, the streets of Paris and London, and several scattered abbeys, churches, cathedrals, and country estates.<br /><br />Given that it is a detective thriller, the movie's strengths are, expectedly, in its plot, which keeps things moving forward fast enough, so that folks don't necessarily have a moment to think on the strength of the evidence itself...except when Hanks' character himself questions it from time to time. Flashback scenes are the mode employed to add some history and depth to the main characters...there would have been no other way possible to have accomplished that, given the self-propelling storyline.<br /><br />The major premise of the plot is what has caused all the controversy. I'm not going to get into that here...no spoiler warnings necessary. For me, not being a religious man, and I'm not offended by this premise. To those who might be, please remember that it is just a movie, and there is no evidence to back up the premise (that I'm aware of)...and that the role of women in the Faith deserves some discussion from time to time, so make use of that time now.<br /><br />This film reminded me of the Ninth Gate, in ambiance and flavour. On the whole, I enjoyed it...there was a little more thinking involved in the watching experience than I've had in a little while.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Best Norton Film Ever."></head><body><p>If you are a fan of Norton buy this movie, by far his best performance.  The story is about redemption, and is highly powerful, and thought and heart provoking.  The violence isnt really that bad compared to saving private ryan, but is still shocking.  The drama is heart wrenching, and the movie makes you think.  The ending is trajec, from beginning to end you think and feel mixed emotions, but in the end you are sad but still feel good, seems strange right.  Its an very important film that explains alot, and should be viewed because it matters.  9 out of a 10.</p></body></html>

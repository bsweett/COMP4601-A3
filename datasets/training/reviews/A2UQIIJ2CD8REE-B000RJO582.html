Anyway, Dawn of the Dead is a remake of the original George Romero classic zombie flick of the same name. The original film is probably the greatest Zombie film ever made. Second best is probably "Night of the Living Dead," which Dawn was the sequel to. There was also "Day of the Dead," which was the weakest in my opinion, but still good, and a 4th film MAY be coming eventually. This remake, however, is a very different film. Luckily, it's also a very good film.<br /><br />Dawn of the Dead is the story of (surprise, surprise) a zombie holocaust. A group of survivors holds up in a mall, and eventually, has to escape. These are the similarities between Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead and George Romero's original. This time around, however, the zombies RUN, the survivors are larger in number and much more likable and relatable, the story is less social commentary and more action/horror, and one woman is pregnant with a baby that is just... "breathtaking," as a Seinfeld fan might say. All this adds up to a very good movie! Not one to top the original, but definitely loads of fun and highly rewatchable. With each viewing, the closer it gets to the level of the original in my book. It may be my preferences for slow zombies and unexplainable causes that keep the original a notch above for me. The music was perfectly chosen. That jazzy version of "Down With the Sickness" is a new fave of mine. The cast is wonderful, and I'm always ready to watch anything with the heart-melting Lindy Booth. Jake Weber is just fantastic as the TV salesman who was born to lead. Ving Rhames kicks azz, as usual, as the tough guy policeman who can't escape his own sense of empathy. The characters of Steve and C.J., the smart-alec yuppie and the mall security guy, are just hilarious. Sarah Polley, who plays a young nurse who just lost her husband to the plague of zombies, may get a bit annoying in some of her more "bleeding heart" scenes, but she plays the part well; and Mekhi Phifer is extremely believable as a young father-to-be who doesn't want to accept the loss of his dream and the things that are happening to his family. I could go on about the rest of the cast, but suffice to say they are excellent. I've always been a fan of Matt Frewer's (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Psi-Factor, Max Headroom).<br /><br />Director Zack Snyder shows masterful skill in a first feature film, and the gore and effects are outstanding.  There are some really great and unforgettable scenes in this film. The opening, with an adorable little girl turned monster, kicks everything off perfectly, letting you know exactly what kind of film you're about to watch. The relationship between Kenneth and Andy was a wonderful touch, though I still wonder why they didn't go down to the toy store and get some remote control airplanes and helicopters to send food to Andy. Well, if you haven't seen the movie, you have no idea what I'm talking about there, sorry. It's good stuff though, trust me. There's this scene towards the end involving a chainsaw that will disturb you intensely AND break your heart a little at the loss of a cutie-pie cast member. I won't give away who; I don't want to spoil it for ya. That was even worse than the baby scene, I think. It was horrible!<br /><br />This unrated, Widescreen, Director's cut version is awesome! It's not LOADED with extras, but you get plenty, and they're great. There's some behind the scenes zombie stuff, a fun commentary with the director and one of the producers, a great fake news segment chronicling the horrible events, Andy's own home recordings throughout the ordeal, and some fine deleted scenes. Plus, the movie itself has an additional nine minutes of footage not seen in theaters! More character development and more gore! Great flick! Pick it up! Definitely a must for any zombie collection, and, along with "Sean of the Dead," one of the best of the new breed of zombie survival horror!</p></body></html>

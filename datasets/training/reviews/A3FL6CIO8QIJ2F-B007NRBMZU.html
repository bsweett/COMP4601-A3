<meta name="summary" content=""One Of My Favorite Films Ever""></head><body><p>Ashton Kutcher proved that he could carry an entire film on his own with "The Butterfly Effect". Up until the release of this movie Ashton was simply typecast as a TV personality, but after the release of "Butterfly" he became a leading man and a huge Hollywood star.<br /> Ashton plays a young man who had a very troubled childhood. He discovers that now, in the present, he has the power to actually go back in time and alter and change his past, sometimes with results not of his own doing.<br /> This is a compelling story and unlike anything Hollywood has ever done. The script and performances are flawless. Amy Smart, who plays Ashton's girlfriend, is excellent, and plays a woman who was sexually abused by her father, and who grows up to be a drug-addicted prostitute.<br /> This particular DVD has two versions: the director's cut and the theatrical one. There are a slew of bonuses including the filmaker's commentary, documentaries on the movie called "The Creative Process" and "Visual Effects", a storyboard gallery, and theatrical trailer. Paul Fischer of "Dark Horizons" says, ""The Butterfly Effect" is an engrossing, unpredictable and original film, more chilling and compelling the "The Sixth Sense"".<br /> This DVD is a dual-layered disc with one side featuring the director's cut and the other the theatrical version. There is also a small booklet that accompanies the set that features the movie chapters.<br /> There are two sequels to "The Butterfly Effect", but neither comes near to the originality and perfection of this one. Save your money and buy "The Butterfly Effect". It is unlike any movie you have seen.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="United 93 --  Challenging and Gut-wrenching"></head><body><p>It is a tough watch from the very beginning because we know what will happen in the next two hours of the film. `United 93' is still a film that deserves praise not only because of its subject matter, but because of the way it treats it on the screen. It is certain that this is not a film that you can casually watch; some people would never watch it (and I don't blame them for it). But if you're still wondering, all I can say is "If not now, when?"<br /><br />Director Paul Greengrass's semi-documentary style with a shaky camera captures the intense atmosphere of the places. `United 93' unfolds on two levels simultaneously - both in the hijacked plane, and in the controlling room on the ground one after the other. The confusion and tension can be of course re-created in books or documentary films, but Greengrass who four years before made terrific `Bloody Sunday' based on the 1972 Irish Civil Right march and its subsequent events, knows the power of cinema, or how films can have us relate to the people in it.<br /><br />I must write about two things here before ending my review. Some say the detailed accounts of the incidents depicted in `United 93,' especially those on the airplane and her crew and passengers, are not entirely based on the confirmed facts. True, and God only knows what happened on United 93, or whether or not the passengers succeeded in breaking into the cockpit. But I can also say that the film is much more convincing and even truthful than those  conspiracy theories about 9/11.<br /><br />There has been discussion on whether or not the film is exploitation. Honestly, I don't know. But is there any other way of recording and presenting this tragedy without being `exploitive'? Or should we wait another 50 years or more to film it while we know it is about the present time and us? Ultimately it comes to this question: "If not now, when?"<br /><br />Always being somber, `United 93' refuses to be sensational - all the more reason for the film to be challenging and gut-wrenching.</p></body></html>

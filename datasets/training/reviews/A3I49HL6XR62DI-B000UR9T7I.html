<meta name="summary" content="Thomas Haden Church is brilliant"></head><body><p>Here it is, short and sweet (all you need to know): Spiderman 3 is worth seeing for the brilliant performance of Thomas Haden Church (Sideways) as the Sandman. The Sandman special effect is terrific. However, this film suffers from the following: 1. Too many super heroes and villains. You can't tell them apart without a scorecard. Goblin Jr. is way too much like Bruce Wayne. You just want to slap Topher Grace's irritating little bad guy. 2. Overacting by Tobey Maguire (the evil spiderman persona is just too much). 3. Too much Mary Jane Watson (yikes, she even sings in this one). 4. Confusing plotline. 5. Way too long; at least a half hour should have been discreetly edited. 6. Comic schtick that falls flat. The scene in the restaurant where Peter is trying to ask Mary Jane to marry him with comic action in the background is excruciating. That's it. The Spiderman franchise is in real danger of going the route of the original Batman films: too many villains, dumb comedy and painful overacting. And, oh yes, Aunt May is so sweet you will want to toss your popcorn.</p></body></html>

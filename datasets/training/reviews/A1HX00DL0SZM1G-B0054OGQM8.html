Initially these included such titles as BRAVEHEART (in 1999 a website was launched with the sole purpose of persuading Paramount to release the Oscar winner on the small shiny discs) before the mountain relented and released the epic in 2000. The same was true with WHERE EAGLES DARE, which went through many twists and turns (including a confusion at the studio level over rights) before finally emerging on the format from Warner in 2003.<br /><br />One of the most often requested titles in those early days of DVD was the Steven Spielberg produced BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy and, after several false starts, it eventually made its triumphant arrival in the latter half of 2002, going on to be one of the biggest sellers of that holiday season.<br /><br />Released theatrically from 1985 to 1990 (with episodes 2 & 3 filmed back-to-back) the BACK TO THE FUTURE movies were among the most popular movies to come out of American cinema in the 1980s.<br /><br />With ingenious scripts that were pure brilliance, the cast and crew were obviously having a great deal of fun filming these three movies and it shows on the screen. The humor is infectious and the subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) time travel references are definite highlights in these light hearted science fiction classics.<br /><br />"Back to the Future" featured a great cast from a youthful Micheal J. Fox, to a zany Christopher Lloyd and a gorgeous, beautiful and sexy Lea Thompson.<br /><br />The movies on this set come well recommended, however be warned, the second and third movies feature some bad aspect ratio errors, however these are easy to overlook.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the documentary that is split into three sections. Although I would have liked it better presented in the same manner as similar documentaries on the STAR WARS and INDIANA JONES sets (ie all together), this is a minor quibble for they are uniformly informative and entertaining.<br /><br />Also of note in this set is an audio track from a lengthy presentation that Director Bob Zemeckis made to a college class on the movies.<br /><br />If you have yet to add this trilogy to your collection, what are you waiting for??

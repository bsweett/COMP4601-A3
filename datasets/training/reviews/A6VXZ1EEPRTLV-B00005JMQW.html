<meta name="summary" content="a big improvement, but can't this guy keep his mask on?"></head><body><p>Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002), was an uneven, and somewhat unsteady feature film debut, for the intrepid webhead.  With the preliminaries out of the way, Spider-Man 2 (2004) is a bit scattered in places, but is still a more streamlined and focused effort, that solidly delivers action, drama, and excitement.  Technical advances in special effects, and a tighter screenplay, contribute to the impressiveness of the film.<br /><br />Alfred Molina is cast as Dr. Otto Octavius, and he nails the character almost perfectly.  Although it might have been better if they had him keep his shirt on, and made him look slimmer.  Donna Murphy as Octavius's wife Rosalie, has a brief but key role, demonstrating that Otto is really a lovable, sensitive guy, who only becomes delusional, when his mind is taken over by his mechanical arms.<br /><br />The sequel picks up some two years later, with Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) in college and living in New York City, but struggling to keep a steady job, pay his rent, and maintain his grades.  Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) has moved on, and is involved with astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies), son of J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons).  Harry Osborn (James Franco) has assumed a significant role in Oscorp, and is backing Dr. Octavius's fusion experiment.  When an accident occurs during a test, Rosalie is killed, and a set of `smart' mechanical arms becomes fused to Octavius's body.  The arms take over his mind, and after disposing of a surgical team, Octavius decides to finance his fusion experiments by turning to crime.  Doc Ock and Spidey tangle for the first time, in a spectacular battle inside a bank, which continues up on the side of a building, with a very plucky Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), in the middle of the fray.<br /><br />The subtext of the film is Peter's inner conflict about being Spider-Man, which apparently is keeping him from finding happiness.  The conflict manifests physically, when Peter becomes nearsighted, and occasionally loses the ability to generate his webbing.  The resulting George of the Jungle like crash landings, get old fast.  Peter's head gets so messed up, that he sees a psychiatrist, who screws him up even more.  Peter tosses his costume into the trash, quits being Spider-Man, and returns to a `normal' life, looking like Harry Potter.  Peter is blasted out of complacency, when Doc Ock kidnaps MJ.<br /><br />The special effects are stunning, as Spidey returns to battle Doc Ock on a train.  Unfortunately the ending of this thrilling sequence, is marred by pure idiocy, as Spider-Man makes like Fred Flintstone, trying to stop the train using his feet.  Spidey winds up without his mask, this time before a trainload of witnesses.  Doc Ock is relentless, and delivers an unconscious Spider-Man to Harry Osborn in return for the tritium he needs for his experiments.  Doc Ock didn't bother to unmask Spidey, but Harry does, becoming perhaps the 100th person, to discover Peter's `secret' identity.<br /><br />The film's final battle is visually impressive, and quite brutal, but still somehow kind of hollow and contrived, as Doc Ock regains his senses, and decides to try and redeem himself, by `drowning' the fusion reaction, and sadly himself as well.  Doc joins The Goblin in supervillain heaven, after becoming the 101st, to discover that Peter is Spider-Man.  MJ follows as the 102nd, and the crisis ends on a romantic, but bittersweet note.  Harry receives a visit from his dead father, while in a very uncool move, Mary Jane mimics The Graduate, setting the stage for Spider-Man 3.<br /><br />Spider-Man 2 is the best of the three films produced so far.  The central story involving Doc Ock is strong, an effort is made to devote some quality time to Aunt May, and a few moments are spent with JJ Jameson, and the Daily Bugle gang.  The MJ/Peter relationship remains pretty awkward, and sometimes silly, but is still an improvement over the first film.  Kirsten Dunst shines, when put in a dangerous situation.<br /><br />It seems that Sam Raimi can't resist unmasking Spider-Man.  Perhaps he believes that providing proof that Maguire is really inside the costume, results in the audience identifying more with the character, but it is just so overdone.  Spider-Man 2 nicely builds momentum, and moves forward strongly.  It loses focus at times and gets off on a few silly tangents, some related to trying appeal to a youthful audience.  The resolution may not be entirely satisfying, and but the overall ride is quite exciting and fun.</p></body></html>

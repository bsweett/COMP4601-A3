<meta name="summary" content="BUY THE 2 DISC EDITION SAVE YOURSELF A TRIP OFF THE COUCH!"></head><body><p>I bought the 1 disc version several years ago and as I watched the movie about half way through it stopped!?? It's one of the few DVD's made that you have to turn over to play the second half of the film! I returned it to the store that day and I waited for this new 2 disc version and the movie. Now I can watch the film without interruption.<br /><br />This a one of the greatest gangster films of all time ever! I'm from the Godfather era, so everything after the first two installments of GF is almost as good. (hehe) :-D It's a totally different style than The Godfather films, but equally as compelling with great performances by DeNiro, Pesci, Liotta , Sorvino and Bracco. The 2 disc edition is an improvement, but hardly special. ;-.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Escaping our families, escaping ourselves"></head><body><p>Every human being has been thru a rebellion phase in our lives.  We rebel against our parents, teachers, social norms.  We challenge the authority of any kind with idealism, or simply spite.  Some people in doing so, dye their hair, pierce their tongue, visit ashrams in India, or simply put prolonged time in serving PeaceCorps or other humanitarian organizations.  Young Christopher McCandless, main protagonist of this film and Krakauer's best selling novel relinquishes his earthly possessions, gives away his money, abandones his identity and sets of for a two year track across country.  He survives by tending to odd jobs and living in the wilderness until his fateful decision to head to Alaska.  He meets some amazing people along the way, but rejects them all.  What struck me about the young man is that he adopts the same emotional shallowness that he has tried to escape from his own parents.  In his embrace of nature and wilderness, he ends up finding his final shelter in a deserted bus that ultimatey becomes his grave.  One cannot but notice that young Christopher McCandless at his very end, becomes what he has tried altogether to escape. Wheather or not we have money and comfortable lives, without human tenderness, love and emotional connections, we are simply empty shells.  We all have to find our way to define happiness but in the process we are responsible in not hurting people who deeply care about us simply we are in pursuit of our own longings.</p></body></html>

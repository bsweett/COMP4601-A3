Even so,I subtracted a star from the otherwise perfect rating simply because something about the movie didn't work.  Not that the plot, style, characterizations and overall visual presentation of the film was not well constructed and in-sync.  It wasn't that... it was the audience.  We are just too well-primed to accept the strange as, well, almost acceptable.<br />In portraying Sy Parrish,Robin Williams takes his deranged writer role in 'Insomnia' up a notch.  At first, Sy seems the typically harmless guy with the best of intentions and one or two loose screws.  He's lonely: no friends, no family. His job seems to be all important to him,and he performs well but, in actuality the job is just a means to an end.  By perfectly processing the film rolls handed over to him at the local discount department store, Sy becomes a voyeur without ever leaving the confines of the world of his apartment and the store. In particular, he has zeroed in on the Yorkin family: Nina, Will and their young son.  To him,they have a model existence,one where Sy envisions himself as an involved "uncle", albeit to the extreme especially when he discovers that Will is having an affair with another photo client. Sy's loose screws drop out of his head as his picture of perfection is trampled and he devises a method of 'helping' the situation in a way that leaves the moviegoer's imagination stinging with bizarre possibilities that I will not disclose.<br />All this makes for an enthralling panorama of suburbian life that mesmerizes but nevertheless misses a beat somewhere in the process.  I think as 21st century film critics we have become just a little too anesthesized to strangeness as portrayed on the silver screen.  We have seen it all, haven't we?  Hannibal Lecter scared the daylights out of us with his slithering tongue and psychological slashing of Jodi Foster in 'The Silence of the Lambs', yet in 'Hannibal', a more gruesome act of eating Ray Liotta's still thinking brain had somewhat of a lesser impact. We have been 'privledged' to see multiple-personalities, child molestors, sexual deviants, serial killers and the all purpose cannibal---hey, we all love the Sopranos---so as creepy as Robin William's portrayal of Sy Parrish should be to our moral and ethical sensibilities, it is somehow diminished by our own sophistication as curried from the virtual world of films. Sy just doesn't provide the 'punch' needed to overthrow Hannibal from the current 'King Weirdo' throne. Visually, the director provides only a hint of what Sy's punishment for Will actually is---and this is the one moment of the film that lifts the hair off the back of the neck---ironically what WE DON"T SEE is more bizarre than what is shown in full technicolor.<br />Nonetheless,'One Hour Photo' is still a good film in spite of our jaded viewpoints. Connie Nielson ('Gladiator') is chic yet vulnerable as the suburban wife and mother and Michael Vartan ('Mists of Avalon')is sufficently sexy and thoroughly ashamed as the straying husband and father. While the sterile whiteness of the ubiquitously offensive suburban superstore and that of William's apartment in the film suggests Sy's toxic need for order in an otherwise unordered situation contrasts well with the picture perfect environs of the Yorkin family's phony Utopian dream.

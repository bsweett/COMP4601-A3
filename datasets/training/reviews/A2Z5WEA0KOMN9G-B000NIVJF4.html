<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good Performance"></head><body><p>This was a pretty good movie.  Awesome performance by Forrest Whitaker.  Seemed to have the dictator thing down to a T.  The performance by the guy who played the doctor was pretty good too.  I liked the way it was shot in a color that made it look like a documentary from the 70's or something.<br /><br />Shame we didn't get to see the Entebbe raid though.</p></body></html>

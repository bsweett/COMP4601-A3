This is how the story goes: A group of best friends have become bored with their adult lives: Adam has been dumped by his girlfriend; Lou is a party guy who can't find the party; Nick's wife controls his every move; and video game-obsessed Jacob won't leave his basement. After a crazy night of drinking in a ski resort hot tub, the men wake up, heads pounding, in the year 1986. This is their chance to kick some past and change their futures - one will find a new love life, one will learn to stand up for himself with the ladies, one will find his mojo, and one will make sure he still exists!<br /><br />The cast led by John Cusack (who also produced) (as Adam) is great! The directing by Steve Pink (who also did the screenplays to "High Fidelity" (2000, also co-produced and was the music supervisor along with Cusack) & "Grosse Pointe Blank" (1997, also co-produced), both, ironically, co-written by Cusack, he is also producing the upcoming "Knight & Day" (2010) is great! The story by Josh Heald & the screenplay by Heald, Sean Anders & John Morris (both of them did the screenplay to "She's Out Of My League" (2010) is great!<br /><br />The music by Christophe Beck (who also did the music to "The Hangover" (2009), "Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief" (2010) & the upcoming "Date Night" (2010) is great! The cinematography by Jack N. Green (who also did the cinematography to "Diary Of A Wimpy Kid" (2010), he also did the cinematography to Clint Eastwood's movies from "Heartbreak Ridge" (1986) to "Space Cowboys" (2000) is great! The film editing by George Folsey Jr. (who also did the film editing to "Animal House" (1978), "The Blues Brothers" (1980), "Coming To America" (1988), "Basic" (2003), "Cheaper By The Dozen" (2003), "Hostel" (2006) & "Hostel Part II" (2007) & James Thomas (who also did the film editing to "Bruno" (2009) & "Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan" (2006) is great! The casting by Lynne Carrow & Susie Farris (who also did the casting to "Elf" (2003) & "Mona Lisa Smile" (2003) is great! The production design by Bob Ziembicki (who also did the production design to "Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story" (1993) & "Scream 2" (1997) is great! The art direction by Kelvin Humenny (who also did the art direction to "Elf" & "Wind Chill" (2007) & Jeremy Stanbridge (who also did the art direction to "The Butterfly Effect" (2004), "Eight Below" (2006), "Shooter" (2007) & the upcoming "The Twilight Saga: Eclipse" (2010) is great! The set decoration by Jill Sprayregen Henkel & Johanne Hubert (who also did the set decoration to "Elf" & "Shooter") is great! The costume design by Dayna Pink (who also did the costume design to "Fame" (2009) & "Crank: High Voltage" (2009) is great!<br /><br />This is a great, funny comedy that keeps you laughing and on the edge of your seat. This is different than most comedies out there right now. John Cusack, again, has another great movie under his belt.</p></body></html>

He is chosen for an experiment, which will transform him into the ultimate soldier, Captain America. Top notch special effects highlight this latest in a long line of superhero films, and it is one of the better ones. He has a love interest that is not only beautiful, but also has a tough side.  Tommy Lee Jones is good as always, as the officer leading the band of soldiers. He brings humor even as his character is playing it straight. Helped by the 3D, this movie is a lot of fun.</p></body></html>

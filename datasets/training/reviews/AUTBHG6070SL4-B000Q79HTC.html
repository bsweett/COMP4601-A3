<meta name="summary" content="Fast-moving and exciting"></head><body><p>The spy-film business is alive and well, despite all of its setbacks. This one is exciting, well paced, and very enjoyable.<br /><br />Someone (Bourne) is found floating at sea, with two bullets in his back and a mysterious message surgically implanted. He wakes up with no idea who, where, or even what he is. He has some skills - languages, and more ominous skills that seem to scare even him. And people are trying to kill him.<br /><br />OK, the "amnesia" plot has been used until it's almost used up. This is really a chases'n'action film, and needed something to get it started. Once the amnesia premise jump-starts the movie, it moves forward very well by itself. Matt Damon did a good job in the title role, except maybe for being too much of a nice guy for the history that eventually catches up to him.<br /><br />I don't normally pay a lot of attention to DVD extras. This has one nice extra, though: a choice of two start and end scenes. The theater edition was good enough, but the extra version was more interesting. It was also more conducive to sequels.<br /><br />If you want a spy/action flick, try this one out. I don't think it will ever become a classic, but it's still good.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

The original Scorpion King was not The Rock, but another guy who with fast reflexes is hard to kill.  He can catch arrows in his bare hands and can deflect weapons with his sword.  He's the best swordsman ever and he's also ruthless.<br /><br />Plots:  I did enjoy the themes of revenge and a thirst for power and how power corrupts.  Not so good was the martial arts fighting - I doubt there were martial arts fighing in pre-Biblical times!  The casual mentions of Biblical cities, such as Sodom & Gomorrah, was interesting as well.<br /><br />The fast action was great, with Dwayne Cooke's crazy arrow scenes (where an arrow can hit you and has enough momentum to punch you out of a bar!), the pause as the beautiful sorceress he has been hired to kill falls in love with him, and the bad old King who finally loses his kingdom.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Making one's own destiny is a lot of work, and the Rock does so out the top!  Kelly Hu as the sorceress is well worth the price of admission.  If you like non-stop action and some scenes that make absolutely no sense but are fun to watch, then rent this film.<br /><br />The Mummy Trilogy is better:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IEVW6E">The Mummy (1999)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IEZP8K">The Mummy Returns</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R02W4Y">The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Highly Over-rated Amityville Horror Rip-off."></head><body><p>This film has ONLY two things going for it. Kubrick meets Nicholson and the advent of the award winning cinematography technology - Stedicam?. True Kubrick fans will agree that this is a highly overrated, undernourished, ill-plotted and inapt adaptation of a Stephen King novel. Even Stephen King agrees with that! The film is marred by an intolerably sluggish beginning and middle act that is supposed to build up to an all out finale of mad proportions. The truth is that it had all been done before in 1979 in an equally as well known film called - The Amityville Horror.<p>The premise is simple. Husband, wife and kid move to a hotel for a snowy winter. Kid has the gift of the second sight, wife is just your average stereotypical "nicey nice" housewife, husband is working at the hotel to keep it running while the owners and the guests are away. He is also writing a book. The hotel turns out to be haunted. This slowly drives the husband insane. He then tries to kill his family with an axe and the wife and kid freak out of it in the process.<p>The Amityville Horror is the original "mad family axe man" movie. It is also the original mad family axe man novel! Both novel and film precede King and Kubrick's vision of the exact same theme, except here you have a hotel that is haunted instead of a house. No points for originality there. You would do the original owners of this theme a great disservice by giving it to Kubrick and King instead.<p>The entire film looks great because of the fluid Stedicam work that goes up the stairs, down the hall, and into every nook and cranny seamlessly. Nicholson does a great job of going insane and then absolutely crackers in the end. Everything else in this film is utterly tedious material that will try your patients to the very last thread. Kubrick did all of his "one million takes" to get that shot. Okay he got the shot, but he forgot entirely about the script and what makes a movie tick. We could say that it is all about the performances - but let us look at that more closely. The kid in this movie says very little and just usually looks scared or intrigued by something, but that is it. Shelley Duvall is the most clich&eacute;d driven character you will ever see. She does little more than attend to Nicholson's every demand in the most sterile of performances that ends up with her doing a lot of screaming. Obviously everybody was made to look dull in this film so that Nicholson's raving lunatic would eclipse their roles. Unfortunately Kubrick should have gone further and got Nicholson's performance to eclipse the entire movie. It goes nowhere near transcending the banality of its 143 minutes. The last 30 minutes is all insanity and chasing the family around with an axe. The other 113 minutes is sheer nothingness as people see a few ghosts and just visit places in the hotel. Nowhere does this film work itself out to excuse almost two hours of its pretentious, exaggerated, hollow setup - and that is all those two hours are. It is a big setup of the hotel, its haunted parts, more areas of the hotel and the family staying together in solitary.<p>Don't by into the flamboyant grandiose big names that went along with this abhorrence of storytelling. The ending, which this whole movie is based on, does absolutely nothing to justify the rest of it. When you sit through this thing from start to finish you will see through its phoniness for what it is. When you couple that with the fact that it is a rip-off, it only lowers everything even more. That is why I give this a 1 star rating.<p>As a fan of the genre this DVD goes where it should belong. Among the other awful direct to video horror movies that gather dust at the back of the shelf as testimony to the great horror films that sit in front of them for regular viewing and cover polishing.</p></body></html>

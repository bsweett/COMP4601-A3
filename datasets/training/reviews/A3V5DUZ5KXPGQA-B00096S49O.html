<meta name="summary" content="Better Than Expected"></head><body><p>Admittedly, I am not a big fan of "romantic comedies" but this was one of the better ones I've seen. I liked this much better than, for example, "Monster In Law" which had two big names in it in the form of Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda.<br /><br />Anyway, Will Smith does an excellent job as Hitch, a man dedicated to helping good but clueless men get the woman of their dreams. Along the way, he falls in love with a gossip columnist named Sara (Eva Mendes) who discovers who he is and exposes him.<br /><br />Will definitely takes this role as his own while Eva Mendes does keep up with him quite nicely as her character has issues of her own that she deals with during the film. The dude from "King Of Queens" is a show stealer as he makes jokes that would've been just funny or not funny at all freakin' hilarious!<br /><br />I agree with the some of the previous reviewers about the content of the film. Though rated PG-13, you could actually almost leave your kids to watch this film as the sexual innuendos are almost non-existent and the bad language only pops up in a handful of scenes. Its almost suitable for families to watch. Make no mistake though, it is hilarious! Worth the price of buying.</p></body></html>

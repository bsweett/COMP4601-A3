It is the story of a California family that hires a Mexican cleaning lady with no knowledge of English that uses her daughter as an interpreter.  The more time she spends with the family the more she finds out about the problems they are facing.  Consequently, she becomes fond of her employers and wishes to help them bridge their differences, until she falls in love with the man of the family and the woman of the family falls in love with her daughter....<br /><br />In short, the acting is pretty good (but nothing great, with the exception of Tea Leoni who does a wonderful job of portraying the psychotic wife), while the dialogues and the plot are just average.<br /><br />The characters are, overall, weak, bland and just plain uninteresting (e.g. the alcoholic mother in law and the two kids)<br /><br />Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...<br /><br />Nevertheless, it should be noted that Paz Vega's potential to make it big in Hollywood is definitely there.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.<br /><br />No masterpiece here... 3 Stars</p></body></html>

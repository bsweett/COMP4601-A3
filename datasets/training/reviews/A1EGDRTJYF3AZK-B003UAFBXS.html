That is why Bruce Campbell didn't get nominated for an oscar;to off the wall, well let me tell you something, this is one of the most original movies ever made. Is it horror, drama, or comedy? that is my challenge to you, put your finger on just one of those choices and then let me know what you think. This movie is worth a view you will thank yourself. I work for a video store in Salem,OR and I put my name on this movie recomending it to my customers, meaning I guarentee you will like it or you can make a complaint to my boss, so far I have had no complaints and I don't think I will. You are missing out if you don't try to see this movie, it's not a family movie but if you can go into it with an open mind it is a movie expierience you won't soon forget; and I put my name on that!</p></body></html>

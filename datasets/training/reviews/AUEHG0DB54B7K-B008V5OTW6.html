In fact, we thought the story would center on the tragic events of the Olympics rather than the search for the organizers of the massacre of the Israeli athletes.  We found the film to be a little long but with powerful performances, particularly by Eric Bana.  The story centers on Eric Bana's character Avner, who is given the assignment of leading one of the teams to assassinate the leaders of Black September.  The teams are made up of people who are not members of the Mossad since they can be easily recognized.  Avner is selected because having been born in Germany he can better pose as a European and with his background as Golda Meir's bodyguard his commitment is unquestionable.  Avner must cut himself off from all that he knows, including his pregnant wife.  He is working on his own with money placed in safety deposit boxes.  The members of his team are also non-Mossad members and without field experience.  They are motivated by their desire to avenge the murders of the athletes. Geoffrey Rush has an interesting role as Avner's coolly detached Mossad contact and Daniel Craig (the new James Bond) is one of the team members.<br /><br />Initially, one wonders how the inexperienced Avner can hope to assassinate all 11 members of Black September.  His information is supplied to him by a shadowy French group header by Michael Lonsdale (who was interesting to see again and was well-cast for the part) who is simply known as Papa. This unnamed group offers information to anyone who is willing to pay but as part of the conditions they will not deal with anyone representing a government.  The condition seemed rather academic since someone like Avner, acting on behalf of a government, can easily work with Papa's group as long as he can reasonably claim his non-association.<br /><br />At first, I was found the planning and execution of the assassinations fascinating as they groped to find a way to carry out their plans.  Their first target is simply shot on his way home then bombs become the weapon of choice used with unpredictable effect.  Stephen Spielberg given us an unbiased view of these events and presents the Palestinian side particularly through the character Ali, who explains to Avner his cause to take back the land that once belonged to Palestine will eventually succeed but only perhaps in 100 years. Avner believes, at first, that he can simply kill the 11 Black September members age stop killing.  But when others replace those who have been killed he questions what he is doing, particularly as members of his team are killed. This is the question that Stephen Spielberg has posed to all of us: How can the killing go on?  What does it solve?<br /><br />Munich has been criticized by all sides as being pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian; instead it is a mirror of events that are still played out today.  The conclusion of Munich shows that intractable ideas perpetuate themselves and that those who question why so much bloodshed has to be are left out in the cold, much like Geoffrey Rush's Mossad boss refuses to "break bread" with Avner.  The greatest flaw of the film is that it is too long. My wife and I were wondering how many assassinations were going to be shown before the story would take a different twist.  One also does not have much empathy with the characters as we ourselves begin the question if they are correct in killing their target or are they merely dupes of the Israeli government.  The film does awaken us to the realities behind the newspaper headlines of the moves and countermoves of people like Avner who can never feel safe and cannot leave behind the killings they have committed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Genuine Film About Honor &amp; What Humans Fight For"></head><body><p>MOVIE: This film was one of the surprises for me of 2003. I saw Tom Cruise playing in this Samurai genre film that looked very bad. I was the victim of bad marketing. The trailer does not show what the movie is truly about. This film is a wonderful exploration of interaction among societies and how the world as a diverse planet can learn from one another. The film was excellent because it really showed the audience about Samurai life and built on the characters and their ideologies. We learn through watching how a Samurai grows up trained to obey the emperor and lives by honor. Through the intense character development comes the importance of the ending. Cruise also gave a good performance but as you've all heard, Ken Watanabe steals the show. Hans Zimmer's score also brought the movie to life as does all of his incredible scores for their movies. The Last Samurai does however becomes the victim of Hollywood cinema. The film is not all historically accurate, but then again the purpose of the film isn't really to be a documentary, but more of a character exploration. This is a movie that is a little gem, not a masterpiece, but not something you want to throw away.<p>VIDEO: The only problem with this transfer is a little grain here and there, but overall a nice effort by Warner. There is also the flaw of some blurring during fast paced scenes. <p>AUDIO: The disc has a Dolby 5.1 track and is pretty clean but not as good as it should be.<p>PACKAGING / EXTRAS: The disc comes in a standard two disc Amaray case (I love two disc sets from warner cause they can't put them in snapper cases). The extras include a 13 minute featurette about Tom Cruise and his experience making the film, Edward Zwick's directors journal a 26 minute featurette, a conversation with Zwick and Cruise, History vs. Hollywood a 22 minute special from the history channel, a production design featurette, a costume featurette, two deleted scenes, and footage from the premieres in Japan, and trailers for the film. Overall a nice heft sack of goodies but I wish they had a featurette dedicated to Hans Zimmer's score since it was very well done.<p>Movie Score: (4 Stars / 5 Stars)<br />DVD Score: (8 / 10)</p></body></html>

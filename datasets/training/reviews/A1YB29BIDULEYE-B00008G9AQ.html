<meta name="summary" content="Impressive Followup to "Sorcerer's Stone""></head><body><p>This follows the legendary first HP movie as well as could have been expected. It is not a few months after the end of Part 1, and Harry is spending his last few days with the Durselys. They are of course still abusive to him. Harry is wondering why he has not heard from his friends. Harry then gets an unexpected guest Dobby who accidentally reveals that he has been hiding Harry's letters.<br /><br />Later, Harry and Ron are unable to get to Platform 9 3/4 which makes them realize that something is up. They make it to school, but end up making the cold/virtuous Snape angry. (He has some valid reasons for his anger here.)<br /><br />Moving on, we meet Ron's sister Ginny, who takes a liking to harry. We also meet Kenneth Brannagh's character. (A writer who seems friendly enough and appears skilled in Defense Against Dark Arts.) Despite his boasting though, we see Snape knock him out easily. At times, Brannagh seems to want to help, but he ends up making matters worse. (Such as when he tries to fix Harry's broken arm, but makes the bones disappear.)<br /><br />the major suspense of this movie has to do with the chamber of secrets. Throughout the film, certain parties (including Hermonie) get paralyzed. We see creepy writing on the walls, and Harry gets a hold of Tom Riddle's diary and learns that the kindhearted Hagrid has a questionable past.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Hagrid is arrested, and Dumbledore is suspended. Harry and Ron go to Hagrid's friend for help, but they find his gratefulness to Hagrid for saving his life does not extend to Hagrid's friends. Tensions rise when Ron's sister Ginny disappears. This leads to a climactic showdown between Harry and a dark wizard we know quite well.<br /><br />If you liked Part 1, don't miss this great sequel.</p></body></html>

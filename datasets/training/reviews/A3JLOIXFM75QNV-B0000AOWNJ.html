<meta name="summary" content="The creepiest film I've ever seen"></head><body><p>I love horror films and have seen many, new and old. However, none have affected me so much as The Ring. Not the Omen, not Excorsist, not The Shining. Those films have nothing on the creepiness that this film possesses. Now, I have not seen the original, but I hear from different people that they find that one better, and some, find the remake better. I guess it doesn't really matter. They are probably both pretty intense. Naomi Watts does a fantastic job as a petrified woman trying to stop something horrible from happening. Of course, she doesn't realise what that entails. The look of the film is one of foreboding. At every turn, in every scene. It must be the hue, its this murky bluish grey, and it surrounds the entire film. You never know what to expect. The beginning of the film is awesome, and the end is the most disturbing, creepiest thing I've ever seen. I cannot look at a well the same way anymore. The infamous tape that is in the movie, while not really scary, it is pretty disturbing. I think the soundtrack has something to do with that as well. Whoever scored the film did a great job in setting the atmosphere.  I still would not really categorize this as a horror film. Its more of a suspense thriller. When I think of horror, I think of a slasher film like Nightmare on Elm St or the Jason films. The Ring is on a completely different level. Though it freaked me out, I still loved it, and have actually seen it more than once.</p></body></html>

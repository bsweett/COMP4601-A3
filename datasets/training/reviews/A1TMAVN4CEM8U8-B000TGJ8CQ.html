Julianne Moore plays an FBI agent who recruits him to help prevent a bombing by Terrorist.  Peter Faulk(aka Columbo) has a small part in the movie.  It's nice to see him still working.<br /><br />This movie has an underlying Science Fiction/ Fantasy theme, something that seems to be happening more and more these days.  I was surprised to find this.  I don't recall it being promoted at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Nicolas Cage and Julianne Moore and Peter Faulk and Science Fiction/ Fantasy movies.<br /><br />Gunner April, 2008</p></body></html>

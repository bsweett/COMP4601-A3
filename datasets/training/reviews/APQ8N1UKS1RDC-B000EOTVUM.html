Was I surprised.<br />I really enjoyed this low budget TERROR film. It is about three<br />teenagers going to see Wolf Creek National Park and their<br />car breaking down along the way. Not to worry? For here comes<br />Mick Taylor(No! Not of the Stones)played brilliantly by the<br />actor John Jarratt. He really gains their trust and seems<br />like a real friendly guy. DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT!  For he is<br />as nasty as they come. The death scenes in this are some<br />of the most unexpected I've ever seen. There are setbacks<br />like if you we're  trapped by this madman and he had left for awhile<br />and you untied yourself.  Would you really take the time to start<br />reading newspaper clippings on this guy and watching videotapes of<br />him??????????  No! You would get the Hell Out! With that and a few<br />other eye's to the ceiling I found to enjoy this movie. For 2000 and up<br />that's saying a WHOLE LOT! Give this movie a try for Oct.<br />You might just HOWL at it(sic)<br /><br />Best line from the movie: There ya are! Just a Head on a stick!</p></body></html>

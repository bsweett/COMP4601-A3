But when one of the animals goes missing from their cage, the other three break free to look for him, only to find themselves reunited ... on a ship en route to Africa. When their vessel is hijacked, however, the friends, who have all been raised in captivity, learn first-hand what life can be like in the wild.The movie doesn't bring you the same comedy such as Shrek , Toy Story or even Findind Nemo.</p></body></html>

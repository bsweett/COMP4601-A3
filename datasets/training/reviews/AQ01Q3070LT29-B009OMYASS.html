<meta name="summary" content="Never go to an unfamilar country for vacation."></head><body><p>This Widescreen DVD is the "sicker and more twisted" UNRATED" version and that means this version contains scenes that could never be shown in the movie theatres and will not be seen on broadcast television.<br />  Adults Only!  Very intense, gross torture. Not for children or easily frightened adults to see!<br />  If you are a fan of SAW (2004) and SAW II (2005), you might like this horror-suspense film of a killer strapping his victims in dangerous human bondage.  This Uncut version will give you the emotional pay-off.<br />  They have been making crime-drama movies since 1934 based upon this weird fetish, but when previews of the film, "Hostel" was shown before the feature presentation of SAW II (2005), the preview was so horrifying, the audience gasped.<br />  Directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever).<br />  Paxton (Jay Hernandez), Josh (Derek Richardson) and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) are in Amsterdam for some wild, uninhibited fun with hemp and sex. After curfew they can't get back into their hostel rooms, so they climb up to a stranger's room, Alexei (Lubomir Bukovy) who is cool with it and happens to be the same age as they are.  He tells the young men that their is another hostel in Bratislava where they can meet girls for sex.  Oli is a drifter they hooked up with in Paris. When Oli ends up disappearing, they get the creeps and decide to leave on the train tomorrow.<br />  What they don't know is that Oli was murdered in a torture chamber. Paxton talks Josh into one more night with the girls. At a party someone slipped them a mickey and they both feel sick. Josh goes back to the hostel, Paxton tries to find a bathroom, but gets locked in a storage room.<br />  Josh and Paxton are not safe at all.<br /><br />Movie is predictable, but still pows a punch. Jay Hernandez rocks in this one.<br />Also in the cast: Rick Hoffman, Jan Vlasak, Jennifer Lim.<br /><br />Followed by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48P4">Hostel - Part II (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>. (2007)<br /><br />*** Update: HOSTEL: Part 3 will go directly to the DVD shelves December 27, 2011.</p></body></html>

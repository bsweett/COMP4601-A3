<meta name="summary" content="What Clint's Thinking"></head><body><p>You're 80 years old. You've won every honor available in your chosen profession. On the side you are a talented and knowledgeable composer and musician.  You always have something interesting to say through your work.  So I'm going to cut Clint Eastwood some slack, a whole lot of slack.  If he wants to ponder what comes next for him and for all of us, that's just fine with me and I'm going to watch while he does it.  It turns out I did it for Hereafter on the day of my mother's expected death at a few years older than Clint.  So I was an easy mark for the emotions of Hereafter, which are -- to be honest -- kind of predictable and manipulative, but also very entertaining.  The opening scene, by now famous, is awesome (and not in the overused slangy sense) and I'm glad to see Matt Damon and Eastwood working together again.  Neither Hereafter nor Invictus is superb, but if they continue collaborating something one day will be.  A bit of droll humor runs in the necessary subplot of Marie LeLay's (Cecile de France) proposed book about the foibles of Francois Mitterrand, which turns into something else entirely, much to the chagrin of her planned publisher.<br /><br />Hereafter is not A Perfect World, The Unforgiven, Mystic River or even Gran Torino.  In other words, it is not Eastwood at his finest.  Nonetheless, it is, as most everything he does, well worth whatever you spend to watch it.</p></body></html>

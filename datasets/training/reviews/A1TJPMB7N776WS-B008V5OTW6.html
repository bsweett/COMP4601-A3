<meta name="summary" content="3 1/2 Stars: The Killings"></head><body><p>Despite the compelling subject matter: Israel avenging the murder of her athletes by the Palestinians at the Munich Olympics in 1972, Steven Spielberg's" Munich" generally lacks the forward propulsion to make it as interesting and important as its subject matter.<br />Though, without a doubt there are several thrilling scenes and terrific performances: for one, Eric Bana as Avner the man to whom Golda Meir (a powerful Lynne Cohen) hands over the power, the money and the right to avenge her fallen athletes and for another Geoffrey Rush as Efraim, Avner's handler.<br />Bana's Avner is a solid, upright man, a minor field agent used to minor assignments but whose unwavering allegiance to Israel and for all that it stands as well as being the son of a hero and a powerful, forthright mother (a thoughtful, conflicted Gila Almagor) who tells him: "We (Jews) finally have a place to call our own...We must not let anyone take it away" (paraphrase).<br /> Bana is very powerful particularly in scenes that require that he perform deeds that would make most of us shudder and falter...his Avner moves ahead without hesitation. Bana's thoughtful face and resolute demeanor make his Avner a man that many would and do follow into battle. Though he is often racked with soul and spirit numbing guilt and later in life with heart-stopping paranoia, Avner never wavers, never tires, never lets down his guard: his pursuit of revenge is indestructable.<br />The scenes involving the murder of the athletes are the most gruesome, the most shocking and the best choreographed and edited: these scenes  make their point through the accumulation of  precise, exact and focused detail...there's not an inch of film in these scenes that is wasted....masterful. If only Spielberg had used the same discretion with the film as a whole: "Munich" is too long by about 20 minutes, the editing is often flaccid and this is a tragic shame, to be honest for the subject matter is rife with all the things that make for suspenseful, exciting drama.<br />"Munich" is graced with several exciting scenes and some magical performances but ultimately it is not a great film though it is a very good one. All the chess pieces were on Spielberg's board, he just chose the wrong moves.</p></body></html>

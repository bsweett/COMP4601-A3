<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Great B-Action Film with Unbelievable Story and Effective Shoot-outs"></head><body><p>John Carpenter cult classic is revamped for the new generation with more actions and violence by the hand of Jean-Fran?ois Richet, promising newcomer from France. This is a kind of action film that would be described as Great B-Action film, and newer `Assault on Precinct 13' would be a real treat for the action film fans despite some obvious flaws in some of its chapters.<br /><br />I said this is a `B' movie because its plot requires us to suspend our disbelief. In the remake (of actually remake of `Rio Bravo'), the police station is attacked by masked killers whose identity most of you find soon, and some of you find incredible. At the New Year's Eve, they can surround Precinct 13, block the communication from there (including cell phones), and attack the place with lots of guns. Perhaps someone in Detroit City must be hearing the noise, isn't it? But no rescue team arrive there, and those who are inside have to fight back with whatever method they can use.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke plays a good cop doing only desk work whose botched mission 8 months ago is still traumatizing him. After the formulaic opening, the film really gets into gear when Lawrence Fishburne, big-time gangster is brought to the precinct for the night. With ill-assorted team including the sexy secretary and fast-talking drug dealer, they try to survive the assault from the outside.<br /><br />As I said `Great' the action sequences in the mid-section of the film are very effective. The cold tone of the film (and the snow constantly falling from the sky) perfectly matches the bloody actions, and the strong performances from the two leading actors really help. Though all the characters are `types' and there is nothing about the character played by monotonous Gabriel Byrne, but the supporting actors -- John Leguizamo, Maria Bello, Drea De Matted, Ja Rule, Brian Dennehy - do their best. But naturally, it is Fishburne whose charismatic existence is undeniable.<br /><br />So is it good? Yes, but not all of it. In addition to the all-too-familiar opening chapters in which the film perhaps unnecessarily tries to explain the background of the principal characters, the concluding section of `Assault on Precinct 13' is very disappointing, not because of the twist given to it (and some of you can anticipate it), but because its prolonged coda. Only in that part the film reminds us of its B action premises, in which the film seems to think things must be in the right places while the audiences are actually waiting for something different.<br /><br />It is still a reasonably thrilling action. Like `Hostage,' however, you have to believe what is totally unbelievable in order to enjoy watching it.</p></body></html>

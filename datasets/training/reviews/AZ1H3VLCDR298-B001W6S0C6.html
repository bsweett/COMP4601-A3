<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton's Batman is THE Batman"></head><body><p>Ever since the film's debut twelve years ago, I have been watching this film first on beta(yes, i was on of the 8 people who still had beta back then), and then on DVD. All I can say is that this film is even more incredible when you add the widescreen picture(it also features a standard version) and Dolby Digital sound to the movie. All I can say is that if you own a DVD player and liked this movie, you'll enjoy this film even more now.<p>Tim Burton has made some of the best movies to come out in recent years, most notably Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow. He created a Batman here that was (please forgive me) even better than the comic book series. The film has a dark, industrial look throughout the film, with little color and a very dark brooding musical score by Danny Elfman. The plot is about Bruce Wayne(Michael Keaton), a rich millionare who fights his personal demons by becoming the Dark Knight, a man who must avenge his parents death every night by stalking and bringing down criminals. But in his path is the Joker, played by the always fabulous Jack Nicholson. Kim Bassinger comes in as Vicky Vale, a photographer who becomes the object of interest for both Batman and the Joker. While there is not as much action in this like the other 3 films, it is the best one when it comes to acting, directing, and overall feel. On DVD, Batman becomes the best comic book film(underneath Superman I and II) of all time.</p></body></html>

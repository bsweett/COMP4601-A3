<meta name="summary" content="High-Quality Melodrama Featuring George Clooney's Most Mature Performance to Date"></head><body><p>The Descendants marks Alexander Payne's return to directing after a seven year absence and before The Artist stole its thunder it was considered the Oscar front-runner in the Best Picture and Best Actor categories. In the end, it won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Critically speaking, it's quite the comeback. In almost 20 years Payne has directed only five films, all from screenplays co-written with his writing partner Jim Taylor. This is the first film the two have not collaborated on the script for, although Taylor remains a producer and Payne's consistency remains as well. As a director, Payne has displayed a unique style that functions through the acting, editing, music, camera work, and writing. That style that was so prevalent in Election, About Schmidt, and Sideways is not as prominent here. It has that quirky Payne-humor coupled with heartwrenching drama, but I wonder if Payne chose to play it safe for his comeback. It obviously worked for him in most circles, but this being his most commercial, straight-forward, and safe effort left me underwhelmed. Payne still deftly blends poignant drama with just the right dose of comedy, once again giving us one of the best films of last year. I just say this with less enthusiasm than I have had for his previous films.<br /><br />The Descendants is based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings and was shot on location in Hawaii. George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer and the sole trustee of untouched Hawaiian land. With the trust set to expire in seven years, Matt is in the middle of a big deal to sell the land when his wife Elizabeth is involved in a boating accident that puts her in a coma. A dire prognosis forces Matt, who has always been the "back-up parent," to take charge in caring for his two daughters, 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley). His relationship with Alex is already strained when she reveals a secret about her comatose mother that unravels Matt's entire life.<br /><br />The beautiful Hawaiian setting adds an ironic contrast to the heavy material. Like any film shot in Hawaii this is beautiful to look at, but the scenery takes a backseat to the involving and touching story. There's a good reason Payne is on the short list of filmmakers retaining final cut privileges to their films. He's a master at handling heavy dramatic subjects with subtlety and humor, while demonstrating a firm grasp on characters and their development. This is a very consistent film with several wonderful scenes. Look at the beautifully acted confrontation between Clooney and Matthew Lillard. It's a bittersweet, tense scene, heartfelt and funny that reveals Lillard as an effective, underutilized talent. He plays this scene to perfection, never over-playing it and finding the perfect balance of guilt, fear, and regret.<br /><br />There's a character named Sid (played by Nick Krause), who shows up doing his best Keanu Reeves impression and seemingly has no role in the story except to accompany Alex and frustrate Matt. Never one to stick to conventions, Payne builds this character to a surprisingly poignant moment with Matt that feels remarkably sincere when it would've seemed contrived in the hands of a lesser writer/director. Finally, Matt's goodbye to his wife is one of the most quietly moving scenes of any film last year. It's a brief, beautiful moment; understated, despite being the film's emotional climax.<br /><br />Robert Forster and Beau Bridges do memorable turns with very few scenes, while Lillard emerges from his permanent spot as Shaggy in anything Scooby-Doo related to show off unexpected range. Miller and Woodley are terrific as the daughters, particularly the 20-year-old Woodley who gives a performance that blows many of her contemporaries out of the water. It announces the emergence of a bright young actress, who is wasting her talent on that unfortunate television show.<br /><br />Clooney, meanwhile, gives his most mature performance to date and certainly one of his best. It's a far cry from the suave, deliriously handsome characters he usually plays. His performance as Matt King is quiet, heartbreaking, and without an ounce of bravado. It shows him in a completely different light. That scene between Matt and his comatose wife is real, powerful acting. Out of the five Best Actor nominees, Clooney was no doubt the runner-up.<br /><br />The Descendants is professionally-made, high-quality melodrama that never diverges into new territory and only separates itself from the pack with Payne's offbeat blend of the comic and tragic. It doesn't rank too highly on the list, but it is one of 2011's best films despite the faint scent of Oscar-bait that surrounds the entire movie and its failure to make the same impact of Payne's previous work. It may not be profound, but it's hard to dislike or not be affected by. It's a melancholy, pleasing effort that I just don't foresee being discussed years from now. Even with these shortcomings, it has heart and is a welcome return from Alexander Payne and a nice change of pace for George Clooney.</p></body></html>

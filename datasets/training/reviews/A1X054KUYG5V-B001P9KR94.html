<meta name="summary" content="Stylish and intensely likable"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />It's easy to get holier-than-thou about this appealingly-old fashioned film (at its core it's a very common star-crossed-lovers-who-won't-get-together-until-Act 3 type of film) but it's directed with verve, acted with intensity, set up with an incredibly interesting gimmick that holds the film together; you'd have to have a heart of stone to not be impressed with the kinetic style and undeniable charm of this deserved (or at least not undeserved) Best Picture winner.<br /><br />3.5/4</p></body></html>

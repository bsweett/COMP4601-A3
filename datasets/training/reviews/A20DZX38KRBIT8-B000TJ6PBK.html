If he did he obviously didn't see Kubrick's The Shining, this movie has nothing on the Shining (which is one of the creepiest and greatest Horror films of all time).  1408 keeps trying to build up to what ends up to be nothing, trys to build tension which leads to absolutly nothing.  Weak lame scares, lame effects, and over all waste of time movie, no scary at all. To try and put this lame excuse of a film in the same class as the Shining is against all the laws of good film making.<br /><br />1408 - sucks, waste of time and money.<br />The Shining - amazing, rent it instead of 1408.<br /><br />Therein lies the difference.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Worthy New Entry into the Horror Genre"></head><body><p>Danny Boyle's apocalyptic 28 Days Later is a very solid horror film.  The first two acts are particularly exciting.  Part tension and part excitement, the first half with keep you engaged.  But around the time the third half rolls around, you won't know what hit you.<br /><br />The ending is just as interesting.  It's a very good movie with a few misteps but enjoyable nonetheless.<br /><br />The DVD features a commentary, deleted scenes, two alternate endings (one filmed, one storyboard), and and some featurettes.<br /><br />Quite an interesting take on the horror genre.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

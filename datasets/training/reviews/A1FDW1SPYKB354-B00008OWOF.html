From the terrificly-retro John Williams musical score, to the fine acting performances, to the vibrant colors that saturate every scene in the film, to the clever animated title sequence, right on through to the enormously fine-tuned 1960s period detail that we see throughout the movie.<br /><br />The sets and the colors used in this film truly make you feel you're back in the mid-1960s.  I only caught one very small error in this "period" flavoring of the movie, and that is a short clip shown of a Boeing 767 jetliner landing. The 767 didn't first fly until 1981.  Everything else lands the viewer directly in the middle of the '60s.<br /><br />The story of one of the granddaddies of all check-forgers, Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., is told here by Mr. Spielberg at a very brisk and viewer-friendly pace; and, even though the picture clocks in at a fairly-lengthy 2 hours and 21 minutes, it never becomes tedious or wears out its welcome.  It seems fresh at every turn.<br /><br />A marvelous film with brilliant attention to period detail, and a first-rate DVD to boot!  The 2-Disc DVD features multiple featurettes on the making of the film, with an ample dose of information provided by Mr. Spielberg himself.<br /><br />I love the "look" and the feel of this film, and the way Director Spielberg uses his camera to tell the story...such as utilizing a high overhead shot looking down on a crowded street teeming with people, one of which is our subject, Mr. Abagnale, who stands out significantly by his merely donning his newly-acquired bright white Pan Am pilot's cap. ... There's another scene where Spielberg chooses to frame his actor (Tom Hanks) in the upper right corner of the screen, shooting him while we gaze over the shoulder of another actor in the foreground. ... And another grandiose Spielberg-like moment comes in the corridor of a fancy hotel, where nothing but the turning of a shoe tells the desire of a would-be femme fatale.<br /><br />And the video transfer to disc is eye-popping!  The colors are very bold and lifelike. Just perfect.<br /><br />This DVD offers three different Main Menus, based on each of the three primary "fake occupations" that Mr. Abagnale engages in.<br /><br />"Catch Me If You Can", the movie and the DVD, is a class act all the way.</p></body></html>

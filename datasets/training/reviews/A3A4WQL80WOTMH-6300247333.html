<meta name="summary" content="A 1980 Finale - not as good or bad as some say"></head><body><p>The first Omen was a masterpiece both from the perspective of acting and screenplay and in terms of being a frightening movie.  The second had a weaker screenplay, acceptable acting though still had a few creepy jolts.  This last in the series still has the tone of classic late 70s horror films (actually 1980) and is about on par with the second Omen in terms of production value.  I found it less scary than Omen 2, and nowhere in the neighborhood of the first one.  Parts of Omen 3 seem a little ridiculous, but overall if you like the vibe of 70s "scary dramas", e.g. Omen, Amityville, Exorcist, etc.., then this Omen 3 has a curiosity value that might appeal.  It's not a great film (certainly no 5 stars), nor is it 1 or even 2 stars.  It's somewhere between 3 and 4 stars - I'd understand either.  Since I often give films I didn't enjoy much 3 stars, I'm giving it 4 because I did find it interesting - perhaps not so much for the convincingness of its story, but more for its production and time period.  I found the film fairly well shot.  And again, these devil movies were all the rage a few decades ago while you don't see as many any more.  So perhaps one of my 4 stars is for nostalgia.</p></body></html>

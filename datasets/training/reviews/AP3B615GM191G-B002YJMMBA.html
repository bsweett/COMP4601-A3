<meta name="summary" content="Suspend Belief, Enjoy Thoroughly!"></head><body><p>Much like the Dan Brown novel that this movie was based on, there is a relatively simple formula to be followed for enjoyment: Suspend belief, enjoy thoroughly!<br /><br />Viewing this film is akin to watching a television show like, say, "24".  You don't sit back and nitpick every plot point...you just go with the flow and (more often than not) get caught up in the emotional drama.  If you are able to do that, this movie will be very enjoyable for you.<br /><br />As I look back on the plot, I just watched the film less then a week ago and I'm still a bit shady as to what exactly was going on...something about ancient Illuminati symbols, the Catholic Church, the election of a new Pope, and underground experiments with the highly explosive "dark matter" compound.  Much like in "The DaVinci Code", everything flies by in such a hurry that it is a bit difficult to digest.  However, due to a great screenplay and competent acting, you will likely find yourself sucked into the whole experience.<br /><br />I cannot speak for the movie's accuracy with relevance to the original novel, as it was so long ago that I read it, but perhaps a bit of a departure wouldn't have been a bad thing, as don't most entertainment connoisseurs always say that the book is better than the movie anyway?!<br /><br />Thus, much like the page-turning appeal of the Dan Brown novel of the same name (where you just HAVE to read "one more chapter" before turning out the lights), this film does the exact same thing in cinematic fashion.  When looked back upon, the pieces may not fit together or even seem downright ludicrous, but it was one heck of a ride!</p></body></html>

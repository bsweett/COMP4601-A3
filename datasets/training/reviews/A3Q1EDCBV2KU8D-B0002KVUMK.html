<meta name="summary" content="A classical monster reunion"></head><body><p>All the greats, Dracula, Frankenstein, Werewolve, even Jecke & Hyde make an appearance in this film.  The movie is dark and sometimes the plot seems a little thing, or the director introduced something but never returned to it.  The movie is good basic entertainment, if you are looking for a high-grade movie or classic, you should probably look elsewhere.  This was great for entertainment, but I didn't add it to my library.</p></body></html>

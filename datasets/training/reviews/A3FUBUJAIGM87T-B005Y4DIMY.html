<meta name="summary" content="2.5 STARS:  Imaginitive & gross, but NOT nearly a classic."></head><body><p>Clive Barker's "Hellraiser" is certainly quite imaginitive, but it is not a horror film classic by any means whatsoever.  As I watched, I thought to myself that this movie is very radical and way out of the ordinary and that is probably why people like it so much.  Frankly, I did not find the cenobytes to be that scary (interesting, yes, but not scary) or Frank in his bloody flesh form.<br /><br />The movie kept my interest because I wanted to see how it would end, so for that part, I'll give it a 2.5 STAR rating, but as an overall horror flick, I wasn't that impressed.  That being said, it was suspenseful and the story is somewhat interesting and entertaining to a certain degree.  The acting is actually pretty good and the directing is average, but the storyline isn't that compelling as far as its merits as a horror movie are concerned.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a man named Frank, who is quite evil (he comes off as more evil than the Cenobytes to me) and very sensual who buys a puzzle box that supposedly contains the secret pleasures and pain of Hell which are obviously closely related.  I sincerely doubt there is any pleasure in Hell, but if you are evil maybe you can get some sick form of pleasure from it.  Anyway, the Cenobytes are released from the box by Frank.  The Cenobytes introduce Frank to incredible torture and pain that is of a supernatural nature.  The leader of the Cenobytes named "Pinhead" orchestrates such torture upon Frank and anyone else who dares to fiddle with that box.  I should say that I found all of the Cenobytes to be interesting and very imaginative.  My favorite one was the whose teeth were always chattering.  I thought he was funny.<br /><br />However, Frank discovers that he can actually regain human form if he is given enough blood and flesh from the living.  His former adulteress procures men that she kills in order to provide this blood to Frank and slowly but surely he regains this human form.  However, the daughter of the adulteress's husband informs the Cenobytes that Frank is escaping their clutches and she leads Frank back to them so that they can take him back to Hell where he belongs.  The young lady discovers that the Cenobytes want her as well, but she is able to manipulate the box to thwart any of their evil advances.<br /><br />The ending of this movie is pretty lame in my opinion as some demon flies off with the box.  While Clive Barker's "Hellraiser" is quite imaginitive and entertaining to some degree, it is also plenty gross and disgusting as the movie indulges itself with inordinate amounts of gore which the film obviously relies very heavily upon in order to attain a horror-like quality.  To me, this is not scary, but it is gross.  I do like blood and gore when it is used correctly to accentuate the horror, but I believe that blood and gore are a tool which should be incidental to the story and atmosphere of the movie.  With "Hellraiser", the blood and gore overshadows the story to some degree.  I understand that a certain amount of gore was necessary to the movie's story, but when the gore overshadows the story, I think the movie becomes more of a display of gore for the sake of gore.  In other words, it takes more than imagination and gore to be a great horror movie, and Clive Barker fails to create the ever elusive classic horror experience in "Hellraiser".<br /><br />Given the criticisms of this movie, I still recommend renting "Hellraiser" just to be able to have said that you have watched it if nothing else, but don't expect it to live up to the raving reviews it has received on Amazon because it simply isn't that scary, nor is it great, and I feel very confident that sophisticated horror movie fans will see exactly what I mean when they watch it.  After having read these glowing reviews, I can honestly say that I was disappointed with "Hellraiser".  2.5 STARS for "Hellraiser" for the fact that it is a decent (but flawed) horror movie, imaginative and entertaining to some extent.  However, for the reasons mentioned herein, I would conclude by saying that I do not think that "Hellraiser" is a great horror movie or a classic horror movie by any stretch of the imagination.</p></body></html>

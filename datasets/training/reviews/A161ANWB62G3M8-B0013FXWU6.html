<meta name="summary" content="Fine drama, confused in places"></head><body><p>This is an intense study of a single minded oil man and his struggles and tests in reaching the top. It also shows the various delusions, brutalities and neglects he is a party to in his rise in his field.<br /><br />Without some first rate acting, this film would not hold together. It has too many uneven elements and parts of the story do not fit as naturally as might be liked. That it remains a stunning piece of cinema is a tribute to everyone involved, but I strongly recommend people to watch and decide for themselves. At the very least, you will see some stunning acting and fine, affecting drama.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A coming of age story for adults in their 30's"></head><body><p>Sideways is an evocative film about male friendship, relationships, flings, marriage, careers, the approach of middle age, settling instead of realizing your true dreams, and, of course, wine.  Wine snobbishness, wine overindulgence, proper wine etiquette, wine as a prelude to sex, wine as an obsession, etc.  Wine is a character, a driving force in this film.  This isn't a film for everyone, and it most likely has appeal to the age group featured in the plotline.<br /><br />The two male leads are former college roommates and complete opposites-Giamatti is an over-indulging, depressed wannabe novelist who just went through a divorce.  Church is an actor/playboy looking for one last fling before he gets married.  The two take a weekend bachelor party trip to wine country.  At first, Giamatti seems like a loser who is dragging everyone down, but then Church takes over as the jerk, the character we are all supposed to hate for his self-centered, reckless behavior.  The movie explores their friendship and their attempts at relationships with women.  This is a powerful drama with some very comedic scenes interspersed (including the discussion of whether committing suicide with further Giamatti's novel, and the scene in which a naked cuckholded husband chases down the pair, beating on their car).</p></body></html>

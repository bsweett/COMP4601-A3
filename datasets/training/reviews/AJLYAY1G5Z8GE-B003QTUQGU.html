<meta name="summary" content="Suitable For Children, Not So Much For Adults"></head><body><p>I know I would have loved watching this movie during my childhood, but today I was just watching it for the special effects it brings. In this regards, special effects and acting were great. I got bored watching it because I am not that much today into cartoons and entertainment material for children, but I'm sure kids would love watching it. I used to love the cartoon version of it when I was a child.<br /><br />With the special effects in this movie, watching it 3D or as blu ray is a must.</p></body></html>

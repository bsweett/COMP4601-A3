<meta name="summary" content="James Bond with Super Heroes - Family Style"></head><body><p>Super heroes are real and possess great powers.  But their actions have become unpopular.  The government finds them too costly to support in the wake of continued lawsuits and has set up a program to hide them from society.  Two such heroes are Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl who have gotten married and had kids.  But Mr. Incredible misses the old days and occasionally sneaks out with an old friend (Frozone) to right wrongs in secret.<br /><br />But then Mr. Incredible is contacted to help stop a powerful robot.  The action gives Mr. Incredible a new lease on his self worth and things begin to look up for him.  But eventually his exploits get him in trouble in a big way and his family gets involved.  First they are just trying to rescue him and then they need to rescue civilians in a plot similar to one used in Astro City.<br /><br />The story and action are excellent.  Combined with a powerful music score, the film often feels like the best of the James Bond films.  A great cross between the superhero story and the secret agent story this story really moves and has real character development.  Overall the film is less intense than Finding Nemo with fewer scary moments and surprisingly little violence.  The scenes of superheroes trying to be mundane are excellent.  A wonderful cast of voices completes the mix and creates a movie that is fun for most ages.<br /><br />I watched the short Jack Jack Attack before the main film and I think it works well that way.  Also included is a wonderful little film called Bounding that can be watches over and over again.  Some deleted scenes, interviews, character bios and other things round out this edition.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

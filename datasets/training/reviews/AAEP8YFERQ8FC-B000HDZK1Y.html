<meta name="summary" content="Salads for the Children"></head><body><p>Jack Black plays Nacho in "Nacho Libre", a monk who works at a Mexican orphanage. He's the cook, and sometimes he just has gruel for the children, which doesn't please anyone. He gets into wrestling, with a disguise and a tag partner, and starts making some more money for salads for the children. Even though he often loses, he's very entertaining, and because of this he still gets paid. He's also in love with a nun...<br /><br />I think Jared Hess, the director, has a really exciting and unique style. Trouble is, the script isn't the best one he's had to work with. It hold's together fairly good, but there are some pretty hammy and cheesy moments about. Looks like they had a lot of fun though.<br /><br />Three and a half stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Overblown Disappointment"></head><body><p>This outing for our mutant friends is disappointing on so many levels. The film makers have clearly lost track of just what it is that made the first two movies so great. One of the great things that Bryan Singer did with those movies was to, ironically, humanize the mutants.<br /><br />Yes, they have amazing powers, but the movies worked best when they treated the use of those powers as just routine. Ice Man blowing on Wolverine's soda to chill it. Magneto simulating the kinetic ball toy on his desktop. These things were done with hardly any fanfare. But it's a far cry from this movie where, every single time Storm decides to use her power, they do a zoom-in to her eyes to remind you they turn white when she exerts herself.<br /><br />We know they're mutants. We know they're super-human. We need to also feel they're human. If the audience can't connect with the heroes, there's no point.<br /><br />**Warning - Minor Spoilers**<br /><br />Add to that the fact that they decided to kill off too many of the big names--and largely without real reason within the story--and the movie not only disappoints, but ends up offending fans of those characters.</p></body></html>

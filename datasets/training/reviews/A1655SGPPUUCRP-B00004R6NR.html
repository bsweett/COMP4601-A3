Since this movie is based on Michael Crichton's bestselling novel, the script, story, and characters are excellent. Sam Neill brought Jurassic Park to life, he was superb! Jeff Goldblum was perfect for the role of Ian Malcolm and brought subtle humor to the screen, which I loved. Laura Dern rocked, this is defintely her best performance yet! The dinosaurs and sets are breathtaking and it's almost scary how real they look! Steven Spielberg did an excellent job at directing Jurassic Park, he deserves an Oscar! Jurassic park is amazing and intriguing, a must see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MOODY, HANDSOME CHARACTER-DRIVEN THRILLER"></head><body><p>It is refreshing to see Mann back in action with a refined thriller amidst this summer's goofy spectacles.<br /><br />Only a master like him could capture urban landscapes in all their naked glory (a nocturnal LA so rich in character you can see the city throb), furnish them with a stunning soundtrack that employs bits of silence just as deftly as thumping percussions, and then wrap it all up into a compelling narrative whole.<br /><br />If there's any justice in the world Foxx should have a glorious future. The guy has incredible screen presence, it shows in the many scenes where he  interacts with Cruise. Pinkett's character was developed decently for the short time in the beginning we had to see her, I see a decent competition for Beyonce and Halle Barry.<br /><br />Never mind the odd moment when the plot doesn&#8217;t compute (for instance, how does one detective suddenly come upon so much information toward the end of the film?). The pacing is so relentlessly intriguing and the visuals so inventively stylish that you'll forget your gripes with the story.<br /><br />There's even a touch of subtle humor, which rounds off this very tense yet wholesome entertainer. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

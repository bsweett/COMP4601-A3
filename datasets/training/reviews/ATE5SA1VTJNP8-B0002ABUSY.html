<meta name="summary" content="I Was Supposed To Hate This"></head><body><p>What do Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dracula, The Shining, and Vanilla Sky have in common?<br /><br />They are all among the god-awful remakes of classics that hollywood has been cashing in on over the last 10 years because they prematurely dismiss all of the fantastic original horror that is thriving in the underground horror fiction scene.<br /><br />Surely, DAWN OF THE DEAD falls into this category, right? Well, no, not at all, actually.<br /><br />Dawn of the Dead 2004 stands on its own as a gutsy all-out splatter flick. Special fx on their own don't impress me, but coupled with interesting characters, witty dialouge, and killer camera work, then they chuff me!<br /><br />Though, I think they overdid it a bit on the music at parts, it was the Johnny Cash tune during the opening credits that really set a strange, eerie apocolyptic tone that is seldom seen in film anymore.<br /><br />I fully expected this to be garbage, but was humbled by the terrific vision and effort put into this project (and Tom Salvini has a cameo appearance!).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HI-DEF HORROR IS MORE SO!"></head><body><p>By general consensus, this is the scariest of all mainstream films.  Now making its "historic Blu-ray premiere" just in time for Halloween.<br /><br />Both versions are included here.  The original 1973 theatrical release and the 2000 Extended Director's Cut.<br /><br />Exceedingly disturbing, crude, violent and blasphemous, the story unfolds like a documentary in which an increasingly frantic mother tries to get help for her sweet, innocent daughter who manifests evidence of a demon within.  The unthinkable becomes a battle in which two priests - one solid in his faith, the other doubt ridden - fight the malevolent entity.<br /><br />Extras in the two-disc set include a new 3-part making of documentary.  There are two commentaries, one with director William Friedkin and the other with writer/producer William Peter Blatty.  Also included is the feature length 1988 documentary "The Fear of God: Making the Exorcist."<br /><br />Something weird about Friedkin's original commentary.  Maybe he thought he was doing it for the visually impaired?<br /><br />The questions remain:  Can humans really be possessed by a non human entity or a demon?  And what happens when we rational human beings encounter the irrational?  That's what's horrific and even more so in hi-def.</p></body></html>

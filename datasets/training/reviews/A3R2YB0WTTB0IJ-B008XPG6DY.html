<meta name="summary" content="MIKAEL HAFSTR&Ouml;M, OPUS 4"></head><body><p>*** 2005. Based on James Siegel's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044661372X">Derailed</a> and directed by Mikael H?fstr&ouml;m. Two married people, Owen and Aniston, meet in a train and plan to start an affair but they are attacked by Vincent Cassel in their hotel room. Later, Cassel blackmails Owen. Between Hitchcock and FATAL ATTRACTION, the film is agreeable and belongs to the Hollywood paranoia and guiltiness sub-gender. Note among many, the reference to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC7PP8">Psycho (Special Edition) (Universal Legacy Series)</a> when Owen tries to make an incriminating car disappear. Already forgotten.</p></body></html>

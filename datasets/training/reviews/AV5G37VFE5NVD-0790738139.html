Confidential," based on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446674249">third book</a> in a series by James Ellroy, works so well because, unlike most neo-noir films, it's not a homage to the noir films of old.  In fact, it was probably the first true film noir to forget about its predecessors since the 1950s, the time period around which the film is set.  And it was just what a film noir should be: gritty, tough, unflinching, intricrate, and confounding.  Each of the film's leading actors, Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, and Kevin Spacey, as well as its lead actress, Kim Basinger, felt like they could've appeared in a film noir straight out of the 1940s.  It's this unnostalgic, straightforward approach that made "L.A. Confidential" so great.<br /><br />The storyline had a classic vibe to it: in 1950s L.A., three cops ferret out the corruption beginning to eat away at the police force.  How each of them does this differs.  You've got your good cop, played by Guy Pearce, a strictly by-the-book wannabe detective and the son of a legendary officer who died in the line of duty.  You got your bad cop, Russell Crowe, a violent star on the force, always on the edge and with a particularly nasty dislike for women abusers.  Then you have a cop who doesn't quite know where he stands, played by Kevin Spacey, except on the set of TV's number-one hit police drama "Badge of Honor," which he supervises.  One of the film's best scenes is when Pearce's character tells Spacey why he became a cop in an effort to convince Spacey to work with him.  Afterwards he asks, "Why did you become a cop?"  Spacey smiles sadly and sighs, "I don't remember."  Picking a favorite of this police trio is hard, because each is perfectly cast: Pearce as an inherently contemptable and ultimately honorable goody-goody, Crowe as an apparent maniac who is smarter than he looks and just trying to do what's right, and Spacey as the pitiful once-cop who's lost his way.<br /><br />But it seems like when most people remember "L.A. Confidential," they remember Kim Basinger, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar.  She deserved it.  Basinger played a prostitute in high demand because she bears a strong resemblance to Veronica Lake (so does Basinger) - but there's much more to her than just a divine appearance.  Similarly, there's more to Basinger than just a fine body, and she proved it here with a surprisingly deep performance, particularly for a supporting role.<br /><br />With all that said, it's apparent that the film garnered much of its power from its sharp-cut characters.  There's no one who is clearly "good" the whole way through, but never once is a character in the grey: they're either good, or they're bad.  They are also some of the most realistic and human people ever to appear in a film noir.  The movie's script, by director Hanson and Brian Helgeland, finds a seamless balance between its characters and its story, and surprisingly holds very little of the snap, crackle n' pop dialog one expects in a film noir.<br />Jerry Goldsmith's score was the one homage the film allowed, with the same sort of morose brass you might expect in an old Bogey pic (and which distinctly recalls the same woeful trumpeting of Goldsmith's theme from Roman Polanski's own neo-noir, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000022TSH">Chinatown</a>").  It was one of those elusive scores that adds life to each scene but also expands the film as a whole.<br /><br />There's something about the look of the film that hangs in my mind.  It may be the color scheme, which consists mostly of black but with the occasional surprise vibrance thrown in through a red or yellow.  Or perhaps it's the lighting, a bright light that makes what's in front of us perfectly clear and a surrounding black mist that begs the question: what does it hide within its shadows?  There is a scene in which Pearce's character pulls up in front of the Nite Owl bar.  That scene brings to mind the painting "Nighthawks" by Edward Hopper (which inspired the look of Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner").  Hanson took a very stylistic approach in his directing of the film, and much of that showed through its dark visuals.<br /><br />It wasn't all darkness, though.  One of the film's most memorable scenes involved an attempted interrogation by Pearce and Spacey at a popular club late at night.  They corner a mobster dating a girl they believe is a prostitute belonging to a popular company which advertises prostitutes who resemble celebrities, in this case Lana Turner.  As Pearce begins throwing out insults at the mobster and especially at his date, we notice Kevin Spacey holding back laughter in the background.  "A w---e who looks like Lana Turner is still a w---e," Pearce says.  The "prostitute" tosses her drink in his face and he stands there, soaked and incredulous, as Spacey says, "That IS Lana Turner."<br /><br />It came as little surprise that "L.A. Confidential" wasn't awarded the Oscar for Best Picture, but fortunately critics recognized it as one of the best films of 1997 and, more importantly, of the decade.  It wasn't only one of the best films of the decade, but one of the best films ever made, a stylish, gritty, cynical yet realistic noir drama that didn't look back at the classics which inspired it.  It didn't need to, because ten years later, we're still looking back at it.</p></body></html>

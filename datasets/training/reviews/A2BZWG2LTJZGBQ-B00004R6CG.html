<meta name="summary" content="Twisted Hitchcockian Brilliance"></head><body><p>Vertigo would probably not make my list of the top five Hitchcock movies, but not because it is not five stars.  It is every bit of that and then some.  It's just that I like some others a little more.  This may be Sir Alfred's most complex and deep movie ever.  Unlike North by Northwest, which came out the year after Vertigo and was very much a fast paced action film without a lot of thinking involved, Vertigo takes place almost exclusively in the characters' minds.  Until you realize that, the movie can seem slow and dull.  Once you see how Jimmy Stewart is manipulated, you understand the horror of Vertigo.<p>Stewart plays Scottie, a former detective who had to quit because he lost a partner in an unfortunate fall from a roof.  Scottie developed a fear of heights from this accident and has vertigo when he climbs even a little ladder.  This renders him almost useless in the field of detective work.<p>A former friend named Gavin, knowing Scottie is out of work, hires him to trail his wife (Kim Novak).  Gavin thinks his wife is crazy, that she believes she is someone who died many years ago.  Scottie reluctantly takes the job and begins following the woman to report to Gavin how she spends her afternoons.  It is strange what she does.<p>What I have done is just set the physical scene.  But believe me, the real story is ahead.  There is tragedy in the movie, along with a complete switch of characters.  Eventually the watcher learns what has happened to the characters in the movie, but the way Stewart is cruelly manipulated throughout is tragic.  I would rather not give away what is really going on.  I would only encourage you to give the film at least two viewings to try to catch the whole story<p>This has been called Hitchcock's most personal film.  It is certainly the most emotional of his work, showing the heartbreak that comes with true love being ripped away in an incredibly cruel manner.  It took me several viewings to really grasp what this movie was about.  I have loved it since.<p>By the way, the top 5 Hitchcock movies in my opinion:<br />1) Notorious<br />2) North by Northwest<br />3) Psycho<br />4) Rear Window<br />5) Strangers on a Train</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Immaculate and restrained fable which was a tremendous surprise."></head><body><p>Ordinarly not a film I would, under most instances, choose to sit down and watch, however "The Illusionist", like an earlier reviewer 'Bu-chan' said, was one that I "surprisingly enjoyed a hell of a lot."  Something I would not have ordinarly have rented or bought in a whim, but was surprised by its rich and elegant manner of purity. I was away probably in the jungle or backpacking Prague when this came out.<br /><br />This gentle, immaculate and restrained fable about true love, strength and subterfuge in Vienna is tremendously imagined and yet strangely stagnant. I love movies that sort of come out of nowhere and knock you out a bit because you really didn't expect it to be so well done. A real gem it was. A masterpiece of acting. Simply top notch characters with believable dialog and Jessica Biel is simply stunning, magically gorgeous and her acting in the period with everyone else in a rich, enticing mesmorizing plot and storyline, is true to all the characters never breaking rank from the period and THAT is a nod for our friend Neil Berger...<br /><br />...Paul Giamatti (Cinderella Men, American Splendor!!, Lady in The Water) is tremendous. When you can shine in a film where totality of brilliant acting can be achieved through an engrossing script and a tremendous ensemble, we can see the craft come through without effort. Seemingly flowing from their air of professionalism, and brought to us to delve into and disappear in their world. Now that is acting.</p></body></html>

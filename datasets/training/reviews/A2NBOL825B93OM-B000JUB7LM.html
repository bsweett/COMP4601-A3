At least, that is what Hollywood thinks. "Million dollar baby" is Eastwood's last movie, a story about a girl (well, let's say a young woman - Hilary Swank) who wants to be a professional boxer, and an old man  - Eastwood - tormented by his past mistakes.<br /><br />Of course, at the beginning Frankie Dunn, the old boxing manager says he doesn't train girls, but in a short time the girl's simplicity and beautiful smile will win the old man's heart. That's the problem with "Million dollar baby". It's utterly predictable, and somewhat shallow. Eastwood has a name in the industry - especially with some of his more recent movies, like the award-winners "The unforgiven", "The bridges of Madison County" and, most of all, "Mystic River" - , so he will get all the money he wants. So "Million dollar baby" has excellent actors, and the necessary atmosphere - settings, props, etc. - to a boxing movie. It's a pity the screenplay wasn't that well developed. Although the dialogue is, at times, very good and funny, from halfway on the movie looks like a mexican soap opera - or "Days of our lives". It's full of the most basic - and obvious -  kind of drama: the greedy and ignorant rednecks, the german villains - who speak not a word of german in the entire movie - broken spines and euthanasia. It's a script created to make the audience cry, but the characters and the story are so shallow that we know where this is going from the very start. I mean, there are no surprises here, and we only relate to the movie due to the good acting of the main actors, not because of the script.<br /><br />The good point in "Million dollar baby" is the acting of Hilary Swank - that is expected - and Clint Eastwood - he still looks and talks like Dirty Harry, but his time he's convincing as an old man. On the other hand, Morgan Freeman was lost in the story, looking like one of those supporting sidekicks in comedies, there solely for the purpose of making the leading actor funnier. And the fighting scenes and sequences are really good too - well directed and enacted.<br /><br />What I mean is, if this was plainly a movie about boxing - and I don't mean like the "Rocky" series, but something like "Raging bull", for example - it could have been much better. As a plain drama, movies like "Million dollar baby" have been made over and over again, so it's nothing new. Take, for example, Alejandro Amenabar's "Mar adentro", which has basically the same theme, but it's a much more touching and believable movie - and a true story as well.<br /><br />"Million dollar baby" is not a bad movie, it's just that I don't understand all the hype created around a story that has been enacted many times before.<br /><br />Grade 6.5/10</p></body></html>

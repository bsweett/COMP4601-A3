<meta name="summary" content="Boring."></head><body><p>Insomnia starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams is pretty boring for a Christopher Nolan film, this is the second film after the brilliant psychological thriller Memento. Insomnia just drags and drags with every minute that passes, even with two famous actors you can't take this film seriously. Hilary Swank is pretty much under-used here, I hated everything about this film. Don't watch this train wreck!</p></body></html>

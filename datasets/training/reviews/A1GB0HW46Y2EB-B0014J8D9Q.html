<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding Film"></head><body><p>Recently I bought the blu-ray of this film.  I had forgotten what a really excellent movie it is -- dramatically as well as visually.  I can see now how it deserved to win the academy award for best picture.  I  noticed that it was photographed using Panavision equipment.  I certainly hope the Panavision corporation is able to resolve its current financial difficulties.  I would hate to see the loss of a corporation that contributed so much to the technical excellence of motion pictures.</p></body></html>

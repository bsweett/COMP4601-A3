<meta name="summary" content="No Cheating The Reaper"></head><body><p>The "Final Destination" series started off with this low-key and middle-budget suspense film. Cast with a bunch of young actors in a twist on the old slasher formula, except this time, the mad killer is old Grimm himself. It makes this movie a minor classic, in that there's never anyone chasing these kids through the woods (so to speak). You don't need to set up a story about the killer that got killed by the angry mob or tormented by nasty classmates. Death doesn't need that kind of contraption, Death just is.<br /><br />Of the actors, only Sean William Scott (aka "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000031WD9">Stifler</a>") and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024FAD9C">Heroes'</a> Ari Larter have moved up from this series starter. Then one of the kids - Devon Sawa - has a premonition that gets him and six classmates plus one teacher booted from the flight. Said plane then explodes upon take-off. This team of cast-offs realize they've cheated death...or did they? Seems Death's Design isn't to crazy about being disrupted, and comes back for the stragglers. This is where "Final Destination" slips back into formula, and became more inventive in the way the teens get killed off. This does sort of make FD a precursor to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SSOHC">Saw</a> series, in that the kills had to be elaborately set up and executed (har har).<br /><br />Even with the beach-blanket-bingo of the FD plotline, the suspense is real. Who goes next and who beats the reaper? The concept was so successful that the Big D came back for two more sets of teens (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLZK">Final Destination 2</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC2HS6">Final Destination 3</a>) with a 4th in the works with little variance in the formula.</p></body></html>

I couldn't believe the Wachowski brothers took such a great idea and turned it into a lead balloon. The first Matrix entry was an ultraslick, hyperkinetic actioner that had me teetering on the edge of my seat for nearly its entire runtime. Everything clicked in "The Matrix," from the intriguing and well-developed characters to the underlying story to the shock and awe special effects. The film even managed to use the action scenes sparingly so as not to overshadow the other elements, something science fiction and thrillers rarely accomplish. Then came "Reloaded," and the gleaming gold of "The Matrix" rapidly turned into rusty iron. Turgid dialogue larded with enough philosophical mumbo jumbo to confound Plato reared its ugly head in nearly every scene. Lord Larry Fishburne, we quickly notice, is turning into this generation's Marlon Brando if the weight gain is any indication. And then there's the action sequences ramped up to insanely high levels. It's like the Wachowskis tried to outdo their own creation and instead created a film that should have bolts in its neck and green paint splashed on its face.<br /><br />It was with some trepidation that I hit the play button on "Revolutions."  I quickly realized I shouldn't have worried. While the film still boasts enough muttered hokum to make your eyes spin around in your head, it is actually quite suspenseful and entertaining. Even professional boat anchor Keanu Reeves can't completely sink this effort. We come into "Revolutions" with the impending attack of the machines on Zion looming like a dark cloud on the horizon. Neo's in trouble again, of course, and is trapped in some subway station between the world and the matrix. Fortunately, he has a cute Indian family and some sinister chap named the Trainman (Bruce Spence) to keep him company. Obviously he won't stay there long thanks to his buddies Trinity and Morpheus, who kick some serious you know what to get their boy back in the game. It's nice to see the sleek and sexy Carrie-Anne Moss return to her character's roots, that of a hard charging warrior who just happens to look great in black leather, even if it lasts for only a few minutes. Needless to say they manage to spring Neo from his subway platform prison, and not a moment to soon: Zion is gearing up to fend off the machines and they are going to need, as Tom Berenger's character in Platoon so nobly opined, "Every swinging d!ck out in the field."<br /><br />What follows when the machines punch through the domed ceiling of the city is my favorite part of the film. It's mindless action here, folks, as the CGI effects fly fast and furious. The defenders in the city climb into these giant robotic machines armed to the teeth with massive machine guns and await the attack. Zion doesn't wait long. Giant drills punch humongous holes in the ceiling, followed by trillions of those familiar probes from the first film. Every citizen lends a hand, especially the women. They run around in the pipes and ductwork armed with homemade rocket launchers picking off the sentinels. Meanwhile, Morpheus and Niobe race back to Zion in their ship in a desperate attempt to save the faltering city. Neo and Trinity accept a more difficult mission: flying one of the ships to Machine City in order to strike a most unusual deal. To say anymore about this top secret and desperate mission would spoil the surprise for the two people in the world who haven't seen the film yet. I can say that it involves yet another battle between the Smith clones and Neo. This time around, however, the effects in the showdown look much better than the laughable burly fight in "Reloaded." I cried at the film's conclusion--not because of anything that happened onscreen but because I realized Keanu Reeves would probably continue making movies.<br /><br />Seriously though, "Revolutions" was an all around better effort than the second installment. I was better able to weather the bouts of philosophical bunkum here than in "Reloaded." Too, the incredible, over the top CGI war effects helped make up for the huge plot holes--almost. For example, I complained about how the second film removed any sense of danger surrounding the Agent Smith character. In the first film no one dared to stand up to the agents, yet everyone takes a crack at them in "Reloaded." The same thing happens to the sentinels in "Revolutions." Weren't they supposed to be these fearsome, nearly indestructible machines? Then how come mere bullets and homemade rockets can knock them out of the air? For that matter, if humans can build giant robots that move around and respond to the movements of the soldier sitting inside, couldn't they find a way to automatically load the guns instead of having kids tote boxes of ammo around on giant carts? Seems awfully inefficient to me. Anyway, you probably won't think about these conundrums as you watch the combat sequences; you'll be far too busy trying to take in all the amazing effects. I should have gone to see this one at the theater.<br /><br />All in all I have to say that the Matrix trilogy is a failure. The first movie will stand for years as a masterful epic, much the way Lucas's original "Star Wars" remains an epochal film, but "Reloaded" and "Revolutions" cannot keep up the pace. Considering the diminishing relevancy of the Star Wars franchise, perhaps the Matrix series is in better company than I thought. I wonder if the Wachowskis will revisit this idea ten or twenty years down the road just as Lucas did?</p></body></html>

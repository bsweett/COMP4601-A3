Jason&quot; the few people whose ears didn't perk up with interest probably just let out a giggle. But one thing that is for sure is that the fans of these movies have been waiting for this movie to come out for what seems like ages. The history of this movie goes back to 1988 when &quot;Friday the 13th: The New Blood&quot; was released. Initially this was the movie that Freddy Krueger (of the &quot;Nightmare On Elm Street&quot; series) and Jason Vorhees (of the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; series) were to face off. But alas, it was never meant to be. Each franchise was owned by a different company (Paramount owned Jason; New Line owns Freddy) and they just couldn't get into bed together. So the project was squashed, if only temporarily, until New Line acquired the rights to Jason and produced their first &quot;Friday&quot; movie: &quot;Jason Goes To Hell&quot; in 1993. Since the two bad guys now worked for the same company, it made sense for &quot;JGTH&quot; to end with Freddy pulling Jason's mask into Hell, forshadowing this movie, which took New Line 10 extra years to develop. And it went through it's own Hell. At least a dozen different story ideas and scripts were being tossed around (some of them very odd and goofy, as documented on the second disc of this DVD). But alas, producers Bob Shaye and Sean S. Cunningham (who birthed and kept each series alive) finally agreed on Damian Shannon &amp; Mark Swift's script, and under Ronny Yu's (&quot;Bride Of Chucky&quot;) direction, a historical horror event was finally born.<p>For me, &quot;Freddy Vs. Jason&quot; exceeded all expectations. No doubt, there will be people who are unhappy with the movie, but that always happens. Instead of being just a wrestling match with Freddy and Jason at each other's throat, this movie has a great story, good characters and an interesting and plausible way to tie the two characters together. Freddy is in Hell. The people of Elm Street have forgotten about him, thus, he has lost his powers. He devises a scheme to resurrect the hockey masked killer Jason Vorhees to put fear back in the hearts of the Elm Street children, all in the name of Freddy. However, things go sour. When Freddy is finally ready to bring down his reign of terror, Jason has slipped out of his control and is getting all of Freddy's blood, so the battle is on. The movie contains some nice heavy dosages of nostalgia. Sure, it's more of a &quot;Nightmare&quot; flick than a &quot;Friday&quot; flick, but both series are treated with respect and none of the history is altered. As a &quot;Nightmare&quot; movie, this one is the tops. Freddy is just as menacing and mysterious as he was in the first two films, the characters are as interesting and likeable as in part three, and the movie itself has the style and energy of part 4. He may crack a few one-liners in this movie, but Freddy is way more sinister than &quot;Freddy's Dead&quot; portrayed him as. Freddy's finest moment is during Mark's death -- a pivotal moment in the movie that brought back a lot of &quot;Elm Street&quot; memories -- his first kill in the movie. Robert Englund was born for this character and he plays it for all it's worth. As far as Jason goes, he does what he does best: hack teenagers up with his trusty machete. The rave scene is Jason's moment; there is something to be said about Jason on fire, stalking teens throughout a cornfield. Despite Kane Hodder (Jason from parts 7-10) being fired, the new guy Ken Kirzinger manages to be just as tough and unstoppable as those before him (maybe even more). The movie also returns to some basic &quot;Friday&quot; elements that &quot;Jason Goes To Hell&quot; and &quot;Jason X&quot; were missing. The last half hour to the ending is just mind bending and the way it ends is perfect if you think about it. I hope there are more sequels on the way (but not a whole new batch of ____ vs. ____ movies). I honestly couldn't have asked more of this movie. It picked me up and had me hooked for the breezy 90 minutes it filled. <p>The DVD is jam packed with stuff, making it an even better experience than when I saw it in theaters. Nevermind the fact that we can now watch this movie over and over again ad nauseam like all the others, but we get a commentary for the director, Ronny Yu, and actors Robert Englund &amp; Ken Kirzinger. We also get in-depth featurettes on virtually every step involved in this movie (a nice bit focuses on Freddy's make-up). Then of course there are a truckload of trailers and a music video for Ill Nino's 'How Can I Live' lifted from the soundtrack (which I highly recommend). If you grew up on these movies and have watched them so many times as I have, you need to look into this movie. It's already a classic in my book.</p></body></html>

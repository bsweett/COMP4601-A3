Since nobody knows who killed Elizabeth Short, and since nothing in this film will change that, it's a waste of your lifespan to view. I hoped for some new, unrevealed info, but found the covers done by A&E and even Unsolved Mysteries to be far more factual and interesting, without the seaminess.</p></body></html>

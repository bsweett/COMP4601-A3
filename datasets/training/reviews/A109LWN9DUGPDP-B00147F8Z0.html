<meta name="summary" content="Blu ray quality review only"></head><body><p>After a lack luster release of Hitman I was hoping Fox would really put some effort into AVP Requiem,sorry but they didn't.First the good the DTS lossless audio really feels up the room with nice deep bass,really decent dialouge,and some great surround work.Also like the Hitman release this is a two disc release with the extra disc being downloadable to your computer or other portable device's.I really like this move by Fox,I think its great I can download and watch this legally to my computer if I'm away from home.Also if special features is your thing there plenty here for that,there's really to many to list but it includes two separate commentary's and plenty of Making of's and those sort's of things.<br />  Now the bad,first and worst is the picture,the picture is plenty sharp and shows some promise here and there but boy the contrast is terrible.Daylight scenes or at night the contrast is just off,it's just to dark for the most part.For those that spend alot of time tuning there TV's to that perfect contrast brightness ratio will be frustrated.Also the colors never really pop there not terrible just not very vivid either.On the good side the flesh tones are pretty good.</p></body></html>

The first being that this fine piece of cinematic brilliance should have won an Academy Award this year.  The Academy should not have just handed Alexander Payne the award for Best Screenplay (as they did Sophia Coppola), but instead awarded him top honors.  This was more than just a story about a famous singer, or an aviator, or a suffering boxer, but instead a story about the human spirit, the bond of friendship, and the power of wine.  To me, all very symbolic of being a human being.  The second argument that I have is that Paul Giamatti was, literally, robbed from being involved with the Oscars this year.  His performance was the strongest that I saw last year, and the strongest that I have seen so far this year.  He brought his character to life, giving us this sense of "every man" coupled with that oh-so-familiar feeling of loss and frustration.  We have all been there, we have all seen the effects that it can have on us, and I truly think that Giamatti best embodied that sensation.<br /><br />With that grumbling aside, I strongly think that this was an amazing film by any standards.  The performances, like wine, were rich, subtle, and just some small scents of fruitiness.  Alexander Payne has proven, with this film and his previous outings that he can capture the American spirit while also showing us a world that is originally not seen in other films.  I cannot remember the last film that I saw where wine was nearly the central character and the surroundings just happened to be quaint little bits of wine country.  The cinematography was beautiful and breathtaking.  For any of us that have never been to that side of the world, Payne gives us that glimpse and creates that sensation of excitement.  After seeing this film, I want to go there, I want to smell what Miles smelled, while racing through the vineyards.  You know that a film has been successful when it actually creates a stir in your body to want to visit that place and experience it yourself.  Payne not only miraculously showed us a beautiful part of our country, but also brought forward the passion for wine.  Wine enthusiasts could only have written the speeches that Giamatti delivers.  While I know that Payne did not do this all his own, you could almost taste the wine that he, Jim Taylor, and Rex Pickett tasted while they were writing.  It is one of those rare cinematic moments where the wine just seeps from the edges of your television, and you instantly fall in love.<br /><br />So, you have a brilliant mind behind the camera giving the direction, you have a passionate subject that explores one of America's pastimes, what else is there to rave about this film.  Well, as if I didn't semi-mention it already, how about the acting?  Could anyone else have put together a stronger cast than Payne did?  Would anyone else have seen Giamatti as the lead and thought that he could handle the pressures of a leading man?  What about Thomas Haden Church?  Did anyone think that this material would put his name into the Oscar scrapbook?  Then there is Madsen, who literally ventured out of the dark to do this project, and she proved that she is ready for Hollywood.  To say that the acting in this film carried this picture would be bad, because every element co-existed together perfectly, but the acting was a notch above your normal field of Hollywood movies.  Giamatti was, well, a genius and I will forever wave my fist at the Academy for forgetting him.  He couldn't have carried this film on his own, thanks to Oh, Church, and Madsen, these four prove they were the power behind this movie.  They were jaw-dropping pieces of perfection.<br /><br />Overall, as if you couldn't tell already, I thought that this was one of the best cinematic outings to come out of Hollywood this year.  Payne, unlike his early work with Miramax, had complete creative control over this project and he proved that he could handle a balanced story, with complex characters and plenty of wine.  His passion for our American landscape shined brightly through this film as it did with About Schmidt, as he toured us through some unknown nooks and crannies of our nation.  He proved that he could bring some lost nobodies out into the mainstream light and prove that he could bring the best out from them.  He proved, to the film community, that he is ready for bigger, bolder projects, and I have no doubt in my mind that we will soon see his face with a "Best Director" Oscar right next to it.  Alexander Payne is one of Hollywood's most underappreciated secrets, and it is about time that he is unleashed onto the world.<br /><br />Bravo Sideways, Bravo.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****</p></body></html>

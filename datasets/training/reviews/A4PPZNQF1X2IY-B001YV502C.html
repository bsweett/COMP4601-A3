Although having some nice characters outlined, the movie really never went anywhere and just got bogged down in recyling violence after awhile.  Most shockingly was the cop-out ending that couldn't even give a face to or a creative explanation for the "Human Project" or whatever it was called.  Quite disappointed they couldn't even put a mildly stimulating story behind the idea (well, they couldn't even give a reasonable explanation for the TOTAL sterility, that was lame too).</p></body></html>

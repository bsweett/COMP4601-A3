This is 1980 TEXAS, representing American innocence and ignorance. Enter Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), psychopathic murderer, relentless hunter, and harbinger of doom. He is the Reaper, the Angel of Death, the Antichrist, Randall Flagg, Michael Myers, and the TERMINATOR x 10! Chigurh represents our societal dissolution into chaos. Our slow, cancerous demise as a nation of life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness. He is the beginning of the end. We are no more than cattle for his bolt-gun. Who is he really? The devil? Well, I don't believe in the devil. However, Anton Chigurh seems extremely familiar to me. Unfortunately, I do believe in him, and read / hear about him most every day, in all of his various guises. He is not so much eeevil as he is anti-good. There is no humanity, only bestial survival. No love (nor hate for that matter), only cold, dead advancement through a society that dares not look at him. I truly believe that he's always been with us. It now appears that he has gained great strength / momentum, and is ready for his day. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a dire warning told in a fable. I can't get it out of my head...</p></body></html>

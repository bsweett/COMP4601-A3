<meta name="summary" content="good acting, but something was missing"></head><body><p>For whatever reason, this film simply did not have the fullness of atmosphere that I expect from Cronenberg.  It felt somehow thin, like he did not understand the culture in the way that he does that of Northern America.  As is his hallmark, it also has extremely graphic violence, to the point that it was sickening for me in ways that his previous films have not been, but that is subjective, I suppose.  I couldn't quite believe it, though it is a near miss.<br /><br />The story is about Eastern EUropean criminals, who are operating in London.  Unable to return home, they are carving a new niche for themselves in prostitution, drugs, and contract killing.  Cronenberg struggles to recreate their unique culture and some of it works, such as the tattoo tradition, whereby their lives are displayed for anyone to see (if they are naked).  Enter an innocent, Watts, who is a midwife taking care of the baby whose birth killed her mother, a sex slave from the Ukraine.  Watts decides to investigate, starting with a notebook she wants to translate.  Naively, she goes to a restauranteur seeking answers, a charming and mild mannered man who is not what he appears.  His son (Cassell) and helper (Mortensen) are the principal characters who carry out his dirty work; their chemistry is the most believable aspect of the entire film and expertly acted.  Mortensen's character is mysterious:  he is a brute who can kill, but also has a sympathetic side, at least for Watts.  What the film lacks in finesse, it tries to make up in violence and nudity, almost entirely of Mortensen.  It didn't work for me.<br /><br />Recommended tepidly.</p></body></html>

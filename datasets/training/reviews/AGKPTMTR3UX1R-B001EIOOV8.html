<meta name="summary" content=""Las Vegas Is A Morality Car Wash.""></head><body><p>CASINO is the third installment of Martin Scorsese's True Crime tryptych. MEAN STREETS and GOODFELLAS preceded it, and highlighted low-level street crime and workaday organized crime. Based on a true story, CASINO takes us inside the glitzy yet seedy universe of Las Vegas in the 1970s, a period when Mob influence reached its apex and then fell, dizzyingly fast.<br /><br />Scorsese brilliantly reunites most of the GOODFELLAS crew for this three hour epic. Robert DeNiro plays "Ace" Rothstein, de facto boss of the Tangiers, while Joe Pesci plays Nicky, his closest friend, bitterest rival, and muscle. Sharon Stone garnered an Oscar nomination for her role as Ginger, a former showgirl/call girl turned Rothstein's wife, who basically makes his life miserable, abuses their daughter, and runs back to her scrawny no-account pimp (James Woods) at every opportunity.<br /><br />Pesci's "Nicky" is GOODFELLAS' "Tommy" with a bank account. More conniving and calculating than Tommy, Nicky is just as amoral and violent. Pesci taps the underlying sociopathic core of the character, drawing it forth like an oil well of evil, and making Nicky the ugly face of CASINO's enclosed world.<br /><br />DeNiro is the handsome face of Vegas, addicted to crazily color-coordinated suits, charming the high rollers, torturing the scam artists, and trying to run a good operation while earning for the boys back home.<br /><br />Both Ace and Nicky are over-the-top characterizations, all the more true to life in Vegas. As Ace muses at one point, "Anywhere else they'd put me in jail. Here they give me civic awards."<br /><br />Their private empire collapses in the end, not so much because of their many excesses, but because they simply outlived their time. The general crackdown on organized crime in the 1980s consumed Las Vegas as well, turning it from a hardcore, all-adult playground into Disneyland with roulette wheels. As the wiseguys vanished the corporations flourished.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that CASINO starts off too slowly. As in GOODFELLAS, Scorsese uses the voice over technique, this time alternating between Ace and Nicky. Scorsese errs at the outset. The voice overs are so dominant in the first half hour that the film slips into documentary mode; however, the cast quickly finds their feet and redeems the remaining two-and-a-half-hours of this film with amazing, engaging performances.<br /><br />Running a far distant second to GOODFELLAS in Scorsese's canon, CASINO is still a fine film, and is a fascinating glimpse into that real world where all of life spins black and red.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="this movie is all about brilliant casting"></head><body><p>with absolutely amazing helen mirren convincing you she is queen elizabeth.<br /><br />and the dramatization? oh well, when you think back, of course you can never really KNOW what happened, was the prime minister blair really so sleezy, was prince charles really moved for about three seconds after his wife's death (eee, i kinda doubt that cuz i think he's a prick), was mrs blair so full of low breed complexes..<br /><br />but it sure seemed real, thanks to brilliant casting, producition and marvelous performance by the entire cast.<br /><br />what it did for me, it gave me a little bit different insight into princess diana. which i will keep for myself.</p></body></html>

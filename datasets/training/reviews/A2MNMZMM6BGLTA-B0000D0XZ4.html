<meta name="summary" content="I liked some of it"></head><body><p>I am a Marvel Comics fan. So in some ways I can be too critical of some of their movies but in other ways I think I give them a lot of latitude cause I want to like them. I think Eric Bana is a very good actor and did a good job but I am not sure he was really right for the part of Bruce Banner. Jennifer Conley and Sam Elliot were excellent in their characterizations of Betty and Thunderbolt Ross. Nick Nolte? I didn't like the character of Banners dad, that part of the storyline or Nick Noltes acting in the role.<br /><br />Now to the star of the movie, THE HULK. I thought the CGI was fine. I have heard people say they didn't like it and say The Hulk looked like Shrek. I didn't see it that way. The best part of the movie were the scenes with The Hulk. He was done very well. The scene where he fights the irradiated dogs was both good for action and somewhat funny. I also liked when The Hulk went up against the jets, helicopters and tanks.<br /><br />I also heard people say they thought it took to long to get to The Hulk. I didn't mind cause it built the suspense and told the back story but it was a bit long in getting to the good stuff.</p></body></html>

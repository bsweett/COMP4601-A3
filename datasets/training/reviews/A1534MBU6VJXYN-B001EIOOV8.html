<meta name="summary" content="Pure Dynamite! One Of Scorsese's Masterpieces."></head><body><p>No director has ever done a better job than Maretin Scorsese at taking moveigoers into the life of the mafia headfirst, and his 1995 movie "Casino". Though not as purely enjoyable or fast paced as "Goodfellas", "Casino" is most certainly a brilliant piece of cinema, a masterpiece that only Scorsese can provide.<br /><br />Like "Goodfellas", "Casino" is based on a true story (and also on a book based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi). Set in 1973, "Casino" tells the story of Sam "Ace" Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a small time hood who sets his sights on owning the Las Vegas strip. With the help of his lifelong friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci in a spellbinding performance on par with his unfrogettable Tommy DeVito), Ace becomes the biggest hotshot in town. He's rich, successful and married to the beautiful Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone). Him and Nicky are on top of the world.<br /><br />But soon, things start to take a downfall. Nick's violent temper and mob connections get him thrown out of every casino in town, while Ace begins to lose control of his empire (and to an extent, some of his mind) in a crooked court case, and Ginger has become a drug addict and soon moves back in with her former pimp, Lester Diamond (the always fantastic James Woods). As the film reaches its shocking (and violent) climax, each of these characters heads for a swift downfall brought on by greed, betrayal and violence. It's a lurid, almost disturbing vision that only Scorsese can provide.<br /><br />"Casino" is undoubtedly one of the best movies Scorsese ever did. Everything about it clicks. I do prefer "Goodfellas" because it was more enjoyable and not as grim, but "Casino" still manages to fire on all cylinders.<br /><br />This special edition is a must for all fans of the movie. Overall, I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

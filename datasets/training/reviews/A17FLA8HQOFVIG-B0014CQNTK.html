<meta name="summary" content="I applaud Ellen Page's performance and just want to keep applauding."></head><body><p>I've been meaning to see this 2007 award-winning film for a long time.  I'm glad I finally did.<br /><br />This is a comedy but it is more than that.  It is a heartwarming story of an off-beat and lovable 16-year old girl who becomes pregnant.  She is exceptionally wise and savvy with one of the most lovable personalities I have ever seen on the scene.  Ellen Page is cast in this role and is absolutely perfect for the part.  I don't think any other actor could have done as well.  I applaud her performance and want to just keep applauding.<br /><br />The screenplay is wonderful too and a great vehicle to showcase her acting.  It is heartwarming and not maudlin as we share her experiences with her understanding family and the prospective adoptive parents who she interviews and bonds with.  There is also good upbeat music throughout which supports the theme of the story.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few bumps along the way.  Her boyfriend invites a different girl to the prom.  The prospective adoptive father becomes enamored with Juno romantically.  She has to deal with her own bulging body and the stares of her classmates.  And there are times that her situation seems too much of a burden for her.<br /><br />This is a really fine film and I highly recommend it for everyone.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

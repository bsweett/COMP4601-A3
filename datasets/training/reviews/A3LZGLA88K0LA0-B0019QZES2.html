Sure, the movie is merely a copy cat version of the original, but throwing in Babs and Hoffman as Ben Stiller's parents is the coup de gras of this enjoyable film.  Blythe Danner may be the second banana to all the shenanigans of her co-stars, but she admirably holds her own, in the role of the wife of a real paranoid lunatic.  This time DeNiro DOES come across more vindictive and irrational than in the first, and there are times when you wonder why Stiller and Teri Polo just don't tell him to stuff it and live their lives without his constant judgment and interference.  But then we wouldn't have a movie would we?  Jinx the Cat and Moses the Dog steal a few scenes, but they aren't in the movie as much as you might have thought.  The little baby is cute, but he gets in the way after a while.  Suffice to say, it's the delightful Streisand in her first movie in almost ten years and her first supporting role and Hoffman in his delightfully zany Bernie that make this movie so special.  Whether it's the whipped cream scene or Hoffman taking on DeNiro in a friendly game of football, these two stars shine like the celestial icons they richly deserve to be.  They alone with DeNiro make this a movie well worth watching and not worrying how bad it would have been without them!</p></body></html>

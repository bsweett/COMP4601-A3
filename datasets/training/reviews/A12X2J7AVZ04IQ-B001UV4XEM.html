Director Todd Phillips put together this  somewhat simple film about a bunch of regular guys on a Bachelor Party trip to Vegas, but to add Zach to the mix, everything goes hilariously wrong, but in a more original way than most films about idiot behavior. Cooper, Bartha and Helms are adults with their own very different agendae; add future brother-in-law Zach, a slightly socio-impaired individual, and insanity ensues. There's no end of fun, and Heather Graham is there in a delightful performance, quite lovable. I enjoyed this film a lot. The DVD had no extras, and that was a REAL bummer.Script was quite fine, and the woman who played Helms' fianc&eacute;e was the perfect bitch. Worth watching!</p></body></html>

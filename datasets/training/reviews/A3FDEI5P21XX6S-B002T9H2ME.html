<meta name="summary" content="I liked both the film and BD, the supplements help a great deal"></head><body><p>In reading the volume of negative and average reviews here and elsewhere I think everyone (that is interested in this film anyway) should give this a watch in Blu then check out the supplements, especially those parties that have some nagging questions about the unexplained elements.<br /><br />The BD is transferred eloquently, with all of the shortcomings (in my view the sets and props added the exact "atmosphere" the director was shooting for and explains in the Q&A and commentaries) captured in original production being preserved perfectly here. Yes, the surface sets and CGI used with the harvester's moondust look noticeably bad, but there are plenty of plot points and a performance strength to make up for it. The clarity in most of the film is competent, with almost a pinnacle in seeing an "invisible" prop - the shower scene his polyclear bikini is obvious. The sound is a valid DTS with some variant usage off screen (reference the scene where GERTY is talking live to command). The supplements are thorough and include:<br /><br />* Commentary by four of the staff. See below.<br />* Commentary by two of the staff (director Jones and producer Fenegen). I much preferred this one, it had a great deal more material that I enjoy about logistics and behind the scenes stuff. Plus only two guys were talking or interacting which is better than four vying for talk time on a quiet film like this.<br />* Whistle, a short film by Jones, 28 minutes. A decent little piece for being a first time project.<br />* Making of, 16:18 minutes. A lodef interview laden set with all of the main staff and cast.<br />* Creating the effects, 11:09 minutes. Gives some good insight on the robot (Gerty), the moondust, vehicles and such.<br />* Science Center Q&A, 20:48 minutes. Jones being interviewed by a group of people in March 2009. Roughly 20 questions ranging from hidden themes, subtexts, a sequel, unanswered plot points and assorted fun stuff. For those having issue with certain outcomes, or mysterious story lines - this actually answers almost all of them - Jones' demeanor was much more  relaxed here than in the Sundance footage.<br />* Sundance Q&A at Moon premiere, 11:15 minutes. Rockwell shows his grace in letting it be all about the staff here, but I felt this was his film hands down - wish he would have talked more.<br />* BD Live, nothing new, just the standard 100 points for registering your disc at Sony.<br /><br />A solid performance film for Rockwell, hope he gets some acknowledgment down the road. The BD is not stellar as the original product was not there to reference, but still a worthy watch - an owner for me not a renter. The MPAA rating is incorrect as it should be R for brief nudity, language and one sexual situation as I found playing it in the store had a couple people all fussy (I don't care about the language but I guess Rockwell's behind and him working his wife in bed caught a few eyes, whatever). Enjoy.</p></body></html>

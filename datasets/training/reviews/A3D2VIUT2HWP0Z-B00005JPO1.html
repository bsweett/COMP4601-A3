<meta name="summary" content="A superb Sequel"></head><body><p>With a Series of films so iconic as the INDIANA JONES series, it would have been too easy to have made this into a colossal turkey. But thanfully, with the original stars, Ray Winstone and some superb additions to the cast, this has turned out very well.The FX augment the story ( as you can see in the extras in Disc 2). I wound up buying two copies of the Double disc edition, one from BEST BUY which has the Crystal skull mounted on a model form in a gift box, and of course I have not opened it... yeah I know, very geeky. But I got the second copy from Amazon and<br />watched it.<br />THE DVD: Pretty well perfect, except that disc one has no commentary. Disc two has some promo for the absurd game "Lego Indiana Jones". There is a lot of Detail in the extras , and it shows the way the film was made, brilliant material.</p></body></html>

This is how the story goes: Woody and Buzz had accepted that their owner Andy would grow up someday, but what happens when that day arrives? In the third installment, Andy is preparing to depart for college, leaving his loyal toys troubled about their uncertain future.<br /><br />The voice cast led by Tom Hanks (as Woody) & Tim Allen (as Buzz) is brilliant! The directing by Lee Unkrich (who also co-wrote the screenplay) (who co-directed and edited "Toy Story 2" (1999), he also edited "Toy Story" (1995), and co-directed "Monsters, Inc." (2001) & "Finding Nemo" (2003) is brilliant! The screenplay by Unkrich, Michael Arndt (who also wrote the story & screenplay to "Little Miss Sunshine" (2006, for which he won an Oscar for his work), John Lassetter (who also executive produced) (who also directed "Toy Story 1 & 2" (also wrote the story), "A Bug's Life" (1998, also wrote the story), "Cars" (2006, also wrote the story & screenplay), he also executive produced "Monsters, Inc.", "Finding Nemo", "The Incredibles" (2004), "Ratatouille" (2007), "Wall-E" (2008), "Bolt" (2008) & "Up" (2009) & Andrew Stanton (who also directed "Finding Nemo" (also wrote the story & screenplay), "Wall-E" (also wrote the story & screenplay) & co-directed "A Bug's Life", he is also directing the upcoming "John Carter Of Mars" (2012, also writing the screenplay), he also executive produced "Monsters, Inc." (also wrote the screenplay), "Ratatouille" & "Up", he also wrote the story & screenplay to "Toy Story 1 & 2" & "A Bug's Life") is brilliant! The music by Randy Newman (who also did the music to "Toy Story 1 & 2", "A Bug's Life", "Monsters, Inc." & "Cars") is brilliant!<br /><br />This is a brilliant, heartwarming (and at some times for a interesting reason, sad) film that will stay with you even after it's done and it also makes you think about certain things in life, especially childhood memories. This is a impressive-looking film, especially in 3D. Disney & Pixar have done it again, brilliantly, with this film. This is just as brilliant as the first two "Toy Story" films. This is the best movie of the summer and of the year, so far, by far. An Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature & Best Original Song.</p></body></html>

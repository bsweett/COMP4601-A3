The first one (2002) was very good but bogged down by the hero's origin story, which becomes uninteresting in repeat viewings; I also wasn't too crazy about the Goblin's helmet (a minor cavil); the second one (2004) featured a great villain, Dr. Octopus, but was horribly marred by two absurd subplots: one that revealed how Peter's spider powers are somehow linked to his confidence level (Huh? I thought he attained his powers through a radioactive spider) and the other concerned Peter revealing his secret identity to a random group of New Yorkers on the subway with the conclusion that they'll keep his identity secret because they're so thankful for his crimefighting heroics -- Why sure!<br /><br />This third installment takes the good elements of the first two films, minus the origin tale & stoo-pid subplots, and goes into total overdrive. What we end up with is easily one of the most entertaining superhero flicks ever made, not to mention it possesses a wealth of spiritual insights, which is a mark of all great films.<br /><br />Some complain that there are too many villains -- the second Green Goblin, the Sandman and Venom -- but weren't the various Green Goblins (or Hobgoblin) and the Osborns always hovering close by Peter/Spidey to some degree in the comics? As for the Sandman, there wasn't enough depth to him to qualify as the sole villain in a feature film blockbuster; hence, the addition of the parasitic alien that becomes Spider-Man's costume for a brief time and, later, possessing Eddie Brock and becoming Venom.<br /><br />On the surface it appears like there would be too much going on and the film would fall prey to overkill, but Raimi is a master filmmaker by this point and somehow makes it all gel. The 2 hours and 20 minute runtime was necessary for this success. Yes, there are a couple of jarring shifts here and there, but wasn't that the way it was in the comics? One minute Peter's involved in some type of drama and a few frames later Spider-Man's saving the city from the latest nutjob in a costume.<br /><br />Like I said, the film delivers on an entertainment level with loads of action, laughs and melodrama. For instance, when Pete gives into the pull of the alien parasite and becomes the Dark Peter it's hilarious and fun.<br /><br />The film would have been effective with just this, but what propels it into the realm of greatness is the depth of the characters and the numerous potent insights into the human condition:<br /><br />- Harry Osborn struggles with his hostility and rivalry toward Peter.<br />- Themes of humble remorse, friendship and faithfulness are touched on.<br />- The universal conflict of flesh/spirit, id/super-ego is powerfully explored as Peter grapples with his dark side.<br />- What at first appears to be a lame reinterpretation of Uncle Ben's murder becomes an awesome illustration of the power of honesty, repentance and forgivenness.<br />- On the surface Peter Parker appears to be the least likely person to be a hero, let alone a superhero. He's kind, meek and physically almost frail. There's absolutely zero machismo posturing with him (until he gives in to the flesh egged on by the alien parasite). And yet he has no qualms about turning on the daring power when required, and then switching it back off once it's no longer necessary. Simply put, Peter Parker is the quintessential male role-model, a gentle and noble evil-fighting warrior.<br /><br />You wouldn't think such potent themes would be effectively addressed in a mere superhero flick, but you'd be wrong. What made Marvel Comics head and shoulders above all other comic brands was not only their creative characters & action, but their maturity and intriguing explorations of morality and the human condition. Even as a 10 year-old boy I was able to clearly see this greatness in Marvel as opposed to other brands (don't get me wrong, other companies had some good stuff as well, it's just that Marvel was in a league of their own).<br /><br />On top of all this you get Gwen Stacy and Captain Stacy! For Gwen they needed someone with a winsome innocence and a babelicious hotness and Bryce Dallas Howard is a pretty good fit.<br /><br />My only gripe is the constant unmasking of Spider-Man, the Goblin and Venom for the obvious purpose of seeing the actor's faces when they speak. This was annoying and unnecessary.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: "Spider-Man 3" is easily the best of Sam Raimi's three Spider-Man flicks -- it's the most entertaining and it has the most spiritual depth. It ranks with the top superhero films of all time.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Idi Amin"></head><body><p>Brutal dictator Idi Amin ruled Uganda for more than ten years during the 1970's.  During his reign, three hundred thousand of his countrymen were killed.  This flawlessly-executed (no pun intended) film is a snapshot of those years through the eyes of Nicolas, a brash young doctor from Scotland who travels to Uganda via a random spin of the globe.  At first joining a medical mission desperate for doctors, he soon falls under the spell of the eloquent and unique general Amin. The Last King of Scotland title refers to Amin's years in the British Army, and his penchant for kilts.<br /><br />In this mesmerizing and alternately funny and chilling film, there are a host of high caliber perfomances, including Gillian Anderson (Scully from the X-Files) as a harried doctor who represents Nicolas' conscience, which he gladly - and somewhat understandably - abandons for the posh life as private doctor to Amin and his three wives and children.<br /><br />History is accurate here, including Amin's macabre penchant for cutting off the legs of his enemies, and putting the right leg to the left side of the body, and the right leg on the left side.  Also shown is the tense drama that was Entebe Airport, when Palestian gunmen, heeding Amin's promise of asylum, hijacked an airplane of Israeli civilians.<br /><br />This film was made entirely in Uganda, with Ugandans making up the supporting cast and the hundreds of extras.  Enjoy, but be sure to have your popcorn and snacks finished before the gruesome last quarter of the movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="All flaws erased by Spacek's indelible lead performance."></head><body><p>Sometimes slow-moving, often with questionable cinematic techniques, Carrie still manages to stand tall as the yardstick by which all Stephen King adaptations are measured thanks to the combination of King's  unforgettable lead character and Sissy Spacek's classic performance as that  character.<p>Brian De Palma has always been quite daring with his  techniques, resulting in moments of great exhilaration when he succeeds,  but more often show-offy distraction when he fails.  In Carrie we see both  at work.  The split-screen he uses for the climactic scene of Carrie's  blind wrath merely serves to kill much of the tension and cause to no end  of confusion; though I applaud the attempt, ordinary parallel editing would  have been much more real-time and frightening.  (One may notice that for  the key shots, De Palma has to revert back to a single-image frame)  On the  other hand, the four cuts he does when Carrie and &quot;Chris&quot; come  face to face are brilliant, like a staggered zoom, but with ten times the  visceral effect.<p>All technical scrutiny aside, this is a performer-based  movie, and Spacek is damn near inscrutable in this role.  The humliiations  of being an outcast in a high-school world, the connection she has with Ms.  Collins, the sheer joy of relating to Tommy Ross at the prom, the blind  wrath and avenging-angel trance during the telekinetic sequences, and the  raw pain when her own mother turns on her -- Spacek nails every moment,  resulting in probably the single most cathartic and sympathetic horror-film  protagonist and lead performance I can remember.  So even as I am dismayed  at the parts when the narrative lags behind, when De Palma beats his  &quot;suspense sequences&quot; to death (the pig's blood over her  head...the suspense would have been perfectly intact with about half a  minute cut out of that sequence), I forgive the film.  After all, as the  title suggests, the film *is* its lead character, and this lead character  is blessed with a stellar performance.</p></body></html>

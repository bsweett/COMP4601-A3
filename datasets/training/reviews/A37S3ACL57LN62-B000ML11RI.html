It is based on a graphic novel, but is also reminiscent of film noir of the 1940s and 50s. This is evident in the use of voice-overs, crime and the personalities of the characters. The extreme loyalty of the film to the novel is refreshing after so many disappointing adaptations such as The Hulk and Daredevil.<br /><br />The film was praised for staying true to its roots. The novel was often superimposed into shots of the film to make the two as identical as possible.<br /><br />The characters are stereotypical representations of what one might expect from a bad neighborhood. All of the men are murderers, even the police. There are good guys and corrupt ones and their clashes result in death most of the time. The women are strippers or prostitutes who use violence to take care of themselves or who utilize their men to do the dirty work for them. The cast is exceptional with stars such as Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood, Benicio Del Toro and Nick Stahl. The characters are highly controversial and they hardly depict role models which is cause for some to question why such famous actors would want to be part of such a project. Director Robert Rodriguez said, "Actors want to create memorable characters; they don't want to play themselves in movies over and over again."<br /><br />The story itself is presented in layers. There is a short story with Josh Hartnett that acts as the very beginning and the end of the film. It is based on the short "The Customer is Always Right" and was created as a vehicle to sell the film to producers. The compelling story starring Bruce Willis ends and returns again after the two center stories. It is based on the short "That Yellow Bastard." There are two middle stories that only have one segment each. One called "The Hard Goodbye" stars Mickey Rourke as a Hulk-like do-gooder that constantly faces trouble. A second non-returning segment stars Clive Owen and is based on the short "The Big Fat Kill." Each story revolves around a man's love for a woman.<br /><br />Rodriguez was ejected from the Screen Actor's Guild for breaking one of the rules with Sin City, working with one or more co-directors.<br /><br />Quentin Tarentino appeared as a guest director and was paid only one dollar for his contribution. The style of the film is reminiscent of Tarentino's own work. The chronological structure of the film is similar to that in Pulp Fiction. There is even a homage to Reservoir Dogs when a man's ear is shot clean off. Tarentino's own fame has brought conflicting ideas about which scene he directed. The general consensus seems to be that he probably directed a relatively unimportant scene.<br /><br />This film is not for the weak at heart nor is it for women who easily get offended by films that might seem to degrade them on the surface. This film contains violence and female nudity. The nudity is not excessive and makes the film realistic.<br /><br />Violence is the most obvious element. It is so abundant that the film almost received a harsher rating than the R rating it received. The visual effects aid this dilemma. They make the amount of blood and the severity of the violence less intense. Some might say that the extremity of the violence is used to generate publicity. Male genitals are attacked several times throughout the film and cannibalism is an addressed issue. Each of these adds to the shock value. The film has been scrutinized by some for being too violent, but creator Frank Miller said, "Chuck Jones got criticism for violence!" referring to the creator of Wile E. Coyote.<br /><br />The visual effects were so unrealistic, they had to be done on a green screen. The film was shot in color and was later changed to stark black and white through a digital process.<br /><br />USA Today outlined the seven cardinal rules of movie-making that Sin City broke. These rules included never making black and white movies, never using voice-overs, never having blatant sexuality in a comic book movie, never using several directors, never making beautiful actors uglier, never excluding famous actors from having dialogue and never relying on green screens for the bulk of a film.<br /><br />Overall, Sin City seems to be a hit or a flop with people with no one in between. The sexuality, violence, and unusual film-making are certainly refreshing elements even if they shock instead of thrill.</p></body></html>

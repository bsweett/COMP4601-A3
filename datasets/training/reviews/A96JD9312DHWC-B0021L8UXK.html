What you don't expect is for the world to turn an emotive 180 and for people to start going a little mad, taking to household and street alike with something horrible infecting them.<br /><br />When The Crazies came out, I was thrilled to see it. I wanted my sheriff to go and lay down the law on a lot of nuts, and he did get that chance. The key is to remember that they are infected with something, too, and that they aren't going around and getting out coffins or anything like that. He and a few other people do their best to hold on and remain "sane" as things get progressively bad too, and they battle a lot of rage-filled people. These fights take place as our leads try to tend to wounds, try to save families, try to save other people, and try to save themselves. And, well, they dwindle like any bipedal river would when you start picking off piece of it.<br /><br />Expectations were high for this movie in some circles - you to see the hype that went on as the movie got closer to the relse - and i think that hurt it a little. From the onset you knew what the movie was about, so plot is down to twists and then you have gore and those lovely little moments when you move from your chair to the skyline. I personally thought the movie was really good in a lot of ways, too, and moreso since I didn't really expect a remake horror film to do well at all.<br />I know it is a remake of obscurity and the 70s when I write this as well, but remakes haven't been the greatest when it comes to track records. Still, this seemed nice and fun to me.<br /><br />One thing it relies on is the fact that you do not know who is infected and you don't know behavior from stress relations or from viral relations. That basically means you could be sitting next to the person that might well want you dead, or it could mean you are over-reacting. In the movie it even seems to imply that the infected don't really notice how gone they are except for some brief moments of clarity, so that comes into play as well.<br /><br />Regardless of what has been said, I thought the movie was good and I enjoyed it. As i noted before, you know what to expect and you have a lot of moments you can almost ocunt on. If, for instanc,e people go into some place with doors, something is bound to be there. You simply get stuck with the brain power of your people here - and whether or not they can think themselve sout of a town that is killing everything, troopers included. Add that to an ending that isn't very nice and you have a movie i liked enough to rate around a 4.5 or so, rounding it to a 5.</p></body></html>

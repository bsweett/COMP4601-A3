I especially enjoyed watching it with the director/writer's commentary: they are highly amusing codgers and it was almost like being in a Hollywood screening room right along with them!  Marc &quot;Jimmy Olsen&quot; McClure does a great job of handling the Hosting duties and you are sure to want this DVD In your collection!</p></body></html>

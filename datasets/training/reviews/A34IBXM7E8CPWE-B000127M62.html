<meta name="summary" content="Fun Movie...Hope There are more to Follow!!"></head><body><p>I have been reading the reviews posted here for Freddy vs. Jason, and I have to say...IF YOU ARE GOING TO TELL THE ENDING OF A FILM IN A REVIEW DO IT ELSEWHERE!!! I went to this movie opening night and have returned for a second viewing because the first time was so much fun. That is what this movie is all about...FUN! It combines the feel of both Nightmare on Elm Street and the Friday the 13th series nicely. We get to cheer for our preferred villain and get some nice scares and action along the way. Is this a scary horror movie? Maybe not...but there are some pretty tense scenes, and some really great action sequences. But please if you have not seen the film, do not read any further reviews because some folks believe in spoiling a good time by giving away the outcome, just go out and see it. I really hope there is some kind of follow-up to this movie. These characters are too much fun to be forgotten.</p></body></html>

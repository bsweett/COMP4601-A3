It has great special effects and it's one of the few films within the costumed female assassin/avenger genre that has a storyline worth your time to figure out.<br /><br />Plot: Set in the future, only one populated city remains on Earth. Outside the high walls surrounding Bregna is only wilderness. Everything appears idyllic on the surface except for one disturbing fact. People suddenly disappear now and then and the governing "Congress of Scientists" refuse to do anything to resolve the mystery. There is a growing faction of dissidents within the city known as the Monican's who want to know why, Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron)is one of them. When it becomes personal Aeon Flux decides to find out what's behind it all.<br /><br />Charlize Theron does a superior job as Aeon Flux, as does Marton Csoka as her adversary Trever Goodchild, head of the "Congress of Scientists." Also featured in a small but pivotal role is Pete Postlethwaite as Keeper.</p></body></html>

For once a movie emerges that is well written, well filmed and well acted with a little controversy thrown in like a punch for good measure.<br /><br />Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) emerges from a trailer park in the middle of nowhere. She reeks of white trash but manages to perfume herself with an undying dream. Maggie wears her heart on her sleeve and exists on the edge of survival pushing towards something better. She pursues the sport of women's boxing with relentless fervor befriending gym-owner Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman). Together the misfits persuade Eddie's partner, Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), to train Maggie professionally. Beneath all the punches there exists vulnerable lives and failing egos but through teamwork and Maggie's brawn the boxing ring encircles them with life lessons.<br /><br />Oscar winner Hilary Swank is incredible in her role as Maggie Fitzgerald. Swank takes the punches and leaves behind the glamour of less gritty roles with her choices paying off immensely. She is entirely believable as the down on her luck loner trying to overcome the stigma of a worthless family. She is America, rough and rugged but filled with a blind passion to succeed despite all the critics who loom at large beneath her dreams. Clint Eastwood captures the power of simplicity in both his acting and directing on this film. Each scene is as unglamorous as most mundane lives unfolding quietly to reveal the true essence of living, that daily grind that most of us forget to appreciate. But it's the grind that reveals our true character and without Eastwood's brilliant low-key style this film would have never emerged as a million dollar gem. As Frankie Dunn, Eastwood is subdued on the surface yet boiling underneath only overflowing with emotions as necessary. And of course the ever fabulous Morgan Freeman excels in his role as a half-blind ex-boxer content to mop floors and wipe bloody noses for his remaining days. His narration guides us forward and offers comfort to this hopeful and sometimes tragic story of real life struggles.<br /><br />This film is simply beautiful. It will make your heart soar for the grittiness of an underdog while identifying with a questioning soul. It is about hard work, perseverance and latching onto a passionate dream that guides you forward relentlessly. But it's also about hard choices and devotion that will leave viewers questioning right and wrong when faced with the desires of someone you love. This film sucker punches you in the end and leaves you breathless for days. But ultimately it takes you inside the ring of a family of misfits and makes you feel like a true champion with your own dreams.</p></body></html>

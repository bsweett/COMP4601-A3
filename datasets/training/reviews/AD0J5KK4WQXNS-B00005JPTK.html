<meta name="summary" content=""I am Legend" only in title, not in content."></head><body><p>The biggest problem with I am Legend is the same problem that Hollywood had with The Omega Man. All they have to do is to make the book from Richard Matheson into a film and don't add anything or take anything. Yet both times they have tampered with the material and both times they end up producing less than average results.<br /><br />A doctor finds himself almost alone in a city trying to find a cure for a cure for cancer that has gone horribly wrong turning people into starving rabid but rapid zombie-ish type creatures that run through the night killing people. The action sequences are mostly of the nightstalker hunting or cure finding sort. Lots of the time Will Smith is left talking to himself, his dog or having flashbacks before the plague.<br /><br />This latest attempt at I am Legend is not an outright disaster. The empty New York set design and Will Smith do save the dodgy CGI nightstalkers and a script that simply deviates too much from the original concept. It is still something you can watch, maybe even enjoy at times, but that is not the point. This is not I am Legend and that is bad because this simply isn't the film we wanted to see and it's the second time Hollywood has got it terribly wrong. It makes matters even worse that we have been waiting over 12 years for it since an Arnie version was announced but then dropped. Third time lucky maybe but not even three stars for this effort.</p></body></html>

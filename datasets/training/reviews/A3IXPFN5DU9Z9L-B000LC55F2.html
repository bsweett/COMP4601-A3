It features many of Nolan's artistic touches, including his trademark out-of-sequence narrative, so those of you who hate this format will be irritated by the progression of this film.<br /><br />The Prestige chronicles the intense rivalry between two ambitious young magicians struggling to make it big in turn of the century London. Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Jackman) actually begin as colleauges, both working as magician's assistants on an act engineered by Cutter (Caine). A tragic accident during one of the performances transforms a mutual professional jealousy into a bitter and lifelong feud that will cost each man dearly.<br /><br />Angier and Borden are the embodiment of two diametrically opposed philosophies and it is this collision of ideals that lies at the very heart of the film. Angier is more concerned with showmanship and accolades than with the magic itself, while for Borden the craft is what consumes him, audience be damned. The lengths each will go to in order to achieve their ideal, and simultaneously outshine the other, provides the key to the mystery that ties the whole story together. This film has not one, but two twists to its ending. You might guess the one halfway through, but the second is very cleverly concealed by Noland's deft direction.<br /><br />The film competed against "The Illusionist", which had been released to critical acclaim a few months earlier. Among the two I prefer the The Prestige, which I find is deeper and handled more maturely. Many people disagree, preferring the lighter, more conspicuously 'magical' Illusionist. This is reflected in the ratings here on Amazon as well (The Illusionist averages half a star better).<br /><br />The Prestige is certainly a darker, somewhat less straight-forward film, and while some might resent the sci-fi spin added in the last act, it provides the basis for the moral abyss into which Angier must fall. Both Angier and Borden are developed to a much greater extent than any character in The Illusionist; they simply feel more human. In fact, it is their very humanity, their frailties, that warp their passion into obsession, and finally into hatred and revenge.<br /><br />Featuring Scarlett Johansson as the love interest and David Bowie in a great turn as Nikola Tesla. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

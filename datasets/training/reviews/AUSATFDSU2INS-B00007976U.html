<meta name="summary" content="Picture perfect"></head><body><p>It is said that an image is worth more than a thousand words. But in One Hour Photo, pictures are worth more than life to Sy Parrish.<br /><br />He works in the photo-laboratory of a local supermarket. He develops the images of the people who captures with their cameras the happiest and most special moments of their lives. Sy takes his job very seriously and makes every effort to make the pictures look perfect.<br /><br />The problem is that Seymour Parrish has seen already too many photos of a particular family, the Yorkins. He becomes obsessed with Nina, Will and his son Jacob, until he considers himself a member of the family. So when something good happens, he is happy for them. But if something is bad, Sy is capable of doing whatever it takes to make things right.<br /><br />And that's how Sy crosses the thin line between sanity and craziness.<br /><br />One Hour Photo offers a darker side of Robin Williams. The comedian and sentimental hero of films like Dead Poets Society or Mrs. Doubtfire leaves behind his do-always-good image and opts for a more aggressive role.<br /><br />Mark Romanek, the director, focus the store completely in Sy; with off narrations, he describes slowly the nature of Sy's personality. Like a photo, a portrait of a repressed, egotistic, neurotic and aggressive man is revealed before our yes, leaving us with a question mark: could our life be that vulnerable?</p></body></html>

The McKinley High School senior class is enjoying a graduation celebration at a local amusement park, but Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, "Sky High") is having bad feelings about the giant roller coaster ride that is supposed to be the highlight of the evening.  When Wendy, her boyfriend, her girlfriend and her boyfriend, Kevin Fischer (Ryan Merriman, "The Ring Two") go to get on the ride the first car is up for grabs.  Wendy refuses to sit there and Kevin loses the coin toss and has to go sit in the back with his girlfriend's girlfriend (they do not even like each other).  It takes a while for it to happen, but everybody dies and then Wendy finds herself back at the start of the ride and starts screaming to let her out of the death trap.<br /><br />You know that "Final Destination 3" is going to be about the Grim Reaper coming for those who survive death the second time around, and so we have the bubble headed tag team of Ashley (Christal Lowe) and Ashlyn (Chelan Simmons), creepy pervert Frankie (Sam Easton), big strong jock Lewis (Texas Battle), and the Goth couple of Ian McKinely (Kris Lemche) and Carrie Dreyer (Gina Holden).  Wendy and Kevin are clearly the privileged couple, which means they are the ones who are going to figure out the pattern and try avoid ending up dead teenager.  Kevin does Internet research so he actually knows about Flight 180 and the first movie, which saves time in getting Wendy on board.  Since she is the control freak, she takes over the key role in what happens.<br /><br />"Final Destination" director James Wong is back as is Glen Morgna who wrote screenplay for the first film from Jeffrey Reddick's story (Wong gets a screenplay credit as well this time).  The opening of "Final Destination 3" is essentially the same as the original, only this time with a roller coaster instead of an airplane and with Wong letting it drag out a bit longer given this is familiar territory.  We know the rules of the game and until the initial death ride is over we cannot get to the main part of this 2006 horror film.  Wong and Morgna also know how to play the game and they make a conscious effort to up the ante for the death sequences.<br /><br />There are two key differences in "Final Destination 3," of varying significance.  The first is that Wendy's camera has pictures of everybody who got off the roller coaster and she makes a connection between what is in the photograph of the first survivors to die and how they die.  Of course, sometimes there is more than one picture and figuring out what are the key elements in the movie comes at the last moment, but it does provide a different dynamic.  However, this is restricted to helping the audience pick up on the elements falling (usually literally) into place to set up the deaths.  Wendy discovers ominous photographs of both the World Trade Center attack and Lincoln's assassination that tie into her theory as well (Suddenly you flash on the next film, "Final Destination 1865," but get confused as to how what happened at Ford's Theater could be turned into one of these Rube Goldbergesque circumstances).<br /><br />The second is that the corpses, if not the deaths, are way more gruesome (this movie wins the award for most gruesome death by a nail gun, which is not example a category short of nominations).  My wife was torn between using her hands to cover her face and grabbing my hand so she could dig her nails into my palms (she decided to go with closing her eyes and lowering her head so she could really dig those nails in nice and deep).  I think the best part of the "Final Definition" films are the way simple things conspire to kill someone and the first two in the first movie (Tod in the bathtub and Ms. Lewton in her kitchen) are still the best of the bunch.  But it has been a long time since I have seen a film where the deaths make you wince, partly because of the blood and everything but also because each one is set up to build the sense of anticipation of seeing something that you do not want to see.  If that is a key criteria for seeing a horror movie in a theater as opposed to waiting for it to come out on DVD, then "Final Destination 3" really delivers.  Let me just say that my wife has informed me in no uncertain terms that she will never go with me to a theater to see another horror film as long as she lives (and I suspect she will not go to see one without me either).<br /><br />The Achilles heel of the "Final Destination" films turns out to be the punch line at the end of the first film, which as I recall was not the original ending.  If you make only one film that final cut to black is a great in your face (or back of your head) ending.  But when you make a series it is problematic because it says that no matter what you see and no matter what they do, all of these kids are going to die.  You can stop short of the actual moment, but everybody is going to arrive at their final destination despite their best efforts.  Consequently, it makes sense that the ante has been upped on the deaths in this film because in the end what else does this story have to offer?</p></body></html>

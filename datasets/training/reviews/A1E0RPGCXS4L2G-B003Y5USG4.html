<meta name="summary" content="You must overlook the obvious"></head><body><p>In order to really appreciate this film you must overlook the obvious.  Such as the fact that many times these tornado chasers somehow seem not to be effected when they are close to the whirlwind.  The special effects are good overall.<p>The chemistry between Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton really pulled me in to the feelings.  The fight in the truck when they get together again is classic.  The characters that they are portraying remind me of many average Jane and Joe's across the country.  The wide variety of personalities that add to the supporting cast are excellent.  Each one, in their own, adding to the overall mood of the movie.  <p>This movie is entertaining (as movies should be) and the flaws are very easily overlooked.  It will be an enjoyable way to pass a few hours some night with the one you love.</p></body></html>

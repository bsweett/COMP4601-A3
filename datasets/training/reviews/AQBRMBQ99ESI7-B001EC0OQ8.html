<meta name="summary" content="A Noir Classic"></head><body><p>This is one of those must have films for noir buffs. Humphrey Boggart plays detective Sam Spade in a convoluted mystery.<br /><br />The story is of Sam Spade, PI, who is retained by a mysterious woman to "find her sister". It turns out that she has no interest in a fictional sister and is lying. In doing so, she manages to get Spade's partner killed and get Sam involved in a plot to steal a golden statue of a falcon, Everyone wants it. The mystery woman can't tell the truth and everyone is coming after Spade for a variety of reasons. He coolly deflects all attempts and drops one liners as he goes along.<br /><br />Boggart turns in a great performance. Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet play to of the thugs and are fun to watch. Mary Astor plays the mystery woman. And does a find job of being irritating. All in all, it's a fun romp on the dark side.</p></body></html>

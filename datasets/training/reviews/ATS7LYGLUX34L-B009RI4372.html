<meta name="summary" content="A Must-Have For Any Horror Fan!"></head><body><p>I Think I was around 11 or 12 when Evil Dead was first released..The articles in Fangoria, the late-night TV commercials, the creepy newspaper ads....I had to see it! (Needless to say, I didn't....) My friend Bryan rented the tape (Beta!) when it came out, and we hunkered down for a midnight screening. It was everything I expected, and more! The perfect Horror movie.<p>  So how does it stand up almost 20 years later? Well....It's still one of the nastiest, most visceral Horror movies I've ever seen. It's easier to pick apart the cheesy acting and hokey dialogue and situations now, since I'm not 13 anymore. I think the other 2 movies in the Dead Trilogy are much better movies, more polished and professional, but the enthusiasm with which the film was made shines through, so it's hard NOT to get caught up in the spirit.........<p>  Director Sam Raimi has since gone on to become the closest thing Hollywood has to a renaissance man, directing virtually every genre of film: Western (The Quick & The Dead), Romance/Sports (For The Love Of The Game), Suspense (The Gift & A Simple Plan), and Superhero/Action (Darkman & now the eagerly awaited Spider-Man), but it all started here, with the small story of a group of friends in an isolated cabin who accidentally resurrect an ancient demonic force. The film is a non-stop thrill-ride, with the gore gushing freely throughout. The weak of Heart need not apply....<p> The idea to package the disc in a "Book of the Dead" case is pure genius, and the case alone is worth the price. The disc itself is great; Chock full of extras, plenty of Easter eggs, 2 commentary tracks, both of which are hilarious AND informative, Galleries of art, photos, and promotional and advertising material, and a few GREAT documentaries. There's even a hidden make-up test and a hidden panel discussion. (Move that cursor along! You'll find 'em!) The transfer of the film is the best I've ever seen, and the sound is top-notch. There's also a great little booklet, as well as a fully illustrated Necronomicon, as seen in the movie. Just don't read it out loud. Especially in the woods. At night.......</p></body></html>

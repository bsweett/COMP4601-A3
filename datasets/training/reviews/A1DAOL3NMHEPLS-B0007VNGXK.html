Ron Perlman does a good job making Hellboy an interesting, even sympathetic, character, but there are too many balls in the air most of the time. The attempt to tie in every baddie of the 20th century, from Rasputin to the Nazis, seems forced.... and who built the huge, elaborate, gear-filled labyrinth under the mausoleum?  Lots of unanswered questions of this type. But if you're willing to go along for the ride, it's entertaining enough.  (We got an extra kick out of hearing David Hyde Pierce as the voice of Abe Sapiens!)</p></body></html>

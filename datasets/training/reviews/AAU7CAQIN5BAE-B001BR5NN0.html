<meta name="summary" content="One Word: Brilliant"></head><body><p>For anyone who is under the age of 8 or who has been serving time in a space prison on Pluto, "The Breakfast Club" is one of the most brilliant films ever made that literally spoke to an entire generation. It sits on my and my friends top 10 list of the greatest film achievements of all time. It is cinematic genuise and John Hughes, with his brilliant eye for the youth in film, portrays teenage life in the 80's better than anyone has ever done. The Breakfast Club is quintessential art, and will stand the test of time long after the cast is old and grey. A Classic. Period.</p></body></html>

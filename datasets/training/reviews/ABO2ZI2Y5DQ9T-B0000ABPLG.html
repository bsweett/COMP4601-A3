Sure, its flaws are too visible, borrowing Orwellian ideas from other films like, say, "Brazil," but it is not that ideas themselves but the way they are put into practice that really counts, and on that score "Equiliburium" is a winner.  (And critics, please let me know, why do you all praise Steven's "Minority Report" which actually borrows ideas from other films of this genre?  So, why not give this one a due respect?)<p>Well, I admit the opening chapter of "Equilibrium" is a bit weak, introducing us to the dystopia world after the WW3, but soon you will forget that.  The totalitarian government established after the war decided to eliminate anything that might possibly make humans emotional, forcing the people to inject a certain doze of [chemical substance] to be unemotional every day. Moreover, it decrees there should be no more music (not only hip-hops, but classic music), no more motion pitures, and no more decorated interiors.  Those who love them hide underground, becoming rebels while the authroity set up a super-cop troop called "Grammaton Clerics."<p>Christian Bale ("American Psyco") is John Preston the best of the Clerics, and dedicates himself to the job until he arrests a woman Mary O'Brien who possessd illegal stuffs.  But her strong creed and perhaps beauty make their way into the sleeping heart of Preston, who has been long fighting for his cause.<p>The film's philosophical messages are in themselves not new at all, and director Kurt Wimmer might have kept his idea a little too long.  I say so, because today, in the 21st century, it is not this Orwellian society that we are afraid of most.  The story has enough twists to surprise us, but maybe one too many, I think, and the wrap-up part of the film feels a bit hurriedly done.<p>However, those are noting before the film's sensational action scenes, which can make up for any flawed part of the film.  The "Gun-Kata" fighting deserves special mention, using [weapons] like Japanese swords, and its hyper-kinetic movement is very violent and very beautiful at the same time.  Incredible it might sound, but Christian Bale shows excellent action star quality here, displaying the beauty of "Kata"s -- and "kata" means in Japanese "style."  Yes, there are lots of styles in "Equilibrium."<p>Other plsyers are also effectively cast, and most unexpected is Emily Watson, who quite naturally becomes the Joan D'Arc-like character.  Taye Diggs is good as Preston's partner, and though short time, Sean Bean, cast against type, is also perfect as Partridge who plays a key role in the story.<p>I was quite surprised and satisfied, and even thrilled to see this neglected film, which should have been more pushed.  Again I say, its actions are sensational.  Not that this is "Matrix"; rather, it is more unique and has its own "kata" = style, which means a lot these days.</p></body></html>

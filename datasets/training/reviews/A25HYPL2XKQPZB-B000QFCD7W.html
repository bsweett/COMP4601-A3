<meta name="summary" content="A great cast is wasted in this by the numbers comedy"></head><body><p>Wild Hogs is the kind of movie you can picture a bunch of Hollywood types sitting around a table talking about. It seems like a great idea and a can't miss premise. You get four quality Hollywood stars (Tim Allen, William H. Macy, Martin Lawrence and John Travolta). They'll play men with various flaws who love to ride motorcycles. In an attempt to salvage the glory of their younger years, they decide to go on a motorcycle road trip. You throw in a strong supporting cast with Marissa Tomei, Ray Liotta, and one of the "others" from Lost (MC Gainey) and you are sure to have a hit on your hands. This movie actually did quite well in the spring 2007 box office, but as I watched, I could see how each scene looked funny on paper, but the actual on screen performance left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />On a whole, this movie was humorous, and even a few times laugh outloud funny. More often however, the jokes seemed force, the cast seemed to be trying to hard. Tim Allen played the same character he always plays, this time a middle-aged dentist who hasn't done anything out of the ordinary in years. Martin Lawrence is a plumber dominated by his lawyer wife, and William H. Macy is computer geek who has no clue about the opposite sex. John Travolta is a guy that has the supermodel wife and the nice house. His friends, however, don't know that his wife is divorcing him and he is flat broke. Once on the road trip, then men encounter various minor problems before encountering a "real" biker gang, led by Ray Liotta. Of course, this is the conflict around whicht the plot revolves.<br /><br />John Travolta is the weakest link in the cast, perhaps through no fault of his own. He singlehandedly does something to the other biker gang, and then for no reason, decides he can't tell his friends what he did. This leads to the conflict, and the whole time if he had just told his friends what he did, then the conflict could have been avoided. The looks on Travolta's face were painful to watch as he agonized over the secret he harbored.<br /><br />This movie is full of cartoonish violence and PG13 type bad language. I thought the closing credits where Extreme Makeover Home Edition was parodied was one of the best parts of the film. I can't recommend anyone buying this movie until they've at least rented it and checked it out. It has a lot going for it but falls short in many other areas, like making you laugh.</p></body></html>

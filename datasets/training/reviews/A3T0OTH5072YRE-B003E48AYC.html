<meta name="summary" content="Alice In Wonderland"></head><body><p>I wasn't terribly taken with this version of Alice In Wonderland.  While it was amazing as far as graphics go, the story was actually boggling.  I couldn't really understand what the point of the plot was.<br /><br />Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is at a party when she sees a mysterious white rabbit.  After falling down a hole, she comes to wonderland.  But it is much changed from the wonderland we all know as our childhood.  She actually encounters the Tweedles fairly quickly as well as a few other characters who tell her her destiny is to slay the Jabberwocky.<br /><br />A bit incredulous Alice is led to the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) and associates.  He sets down his life to save her from the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and tells her to seek out the White Queen (Anne Hathaway).  There she prepares for the ultimate battle against the Jabberwocky.<br /><br />The characters in this movie, to me, were lukewarm at best.  While I always enjoy Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp, they played the only characters that I actually enjoyed in the movie.  Even Alice didn't hold the charm for me she should have.  The rest of the characters seemed minor and weren't really developed.  One other exception would be the Cheshire cat, I found him delightful.<br /><br />While Burton's done some wonderful work, I just don't think this was up to his usual standard.  Even the music was only so-so any nothing that really made me go "wow".<br /><br />The makeup and visuals in this film are outstanding however.  They are very crazy looking but don't look fake or not well done.  A lot of care was put in the costumes and it made it very realistic.  Even the Mad Hatter's hat played an integral roll in the movie.<br /><br />Overall I wasn't terribly impressed.  But for a night with nothing else to do, I'd definitely watch it again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Up is worthy Blu-Ray purchase!!!!"></head><body><p>Up is by far my favorite Pixar movie. WHen I saw it in digital 3D, I was excited but also very doubtful, because I was unsure of whether or not Disney would be able to reach the heights that they did with "WALL-E". But I walked out of the theater totally amazed! It is indeed Pixar's best film yet, even better than WALL-E.<br /><br />Yesteday I bought this at HMV. When I got home, I watched the movie and then explored the features.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY: 5/5: This edition has what most blu-rays lack nowadays- reak ooomph. You can feel it when the house ascends from the ground! The score is vivified here too, almost in a way that the score plays a real charater in the film. The subwoofer and back speakers create a sense of surrounding too- something that makes you feel like you're in it.<br /><br />PICTURE: Infinite/5- This may just have the best picture quality for the Blu-Ray format. WALL-E and Bolt were both deemed to be the best Blu-Ray releases, but this one beats them put of the park. No grain, no artifacts, no edge enhancement, just perfect. No complaints about the picture at all! The Boosted-Up colors in "WALL-E" looked great, but this movie takes on a more natural look, whereas they still srike you. The montage looked great, but what looked the best were the scenes in Muntz's blimp.<br /><br />EXTRAS: 4/5- They were pretty good extras, but this didn't need to have two discs- a lot of the features could easily fit on one disc. That said, they're still cool. The alternate endings one was really cool, the game was a fun play, and the documentaries were worth watching for sure.<br /><br />TOTAL: 5/5- Do get this Blu-Ray. You will not regret it!</p></body></html>

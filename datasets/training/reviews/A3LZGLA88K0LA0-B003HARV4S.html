<meta name="summary" content="SLIGHT OF HAND...AND MORE"></head><body><p>THE ILLUSIONIST is a really different kind of film:  it's a love story; a murder mystery and a game of magical mysteries.<br /><br />Set in turn of the century Vienna it follows the incomparable illusionist Eisenheim, who wins the devotion and support of his audiences, but infuriates the Crown Prince who demands to know Eisenheim's secrets.  Eisenheim also runs into his childhood sweetheart, Sophie, who is going to become engaged to the Crown Prince.  When Sophie decides to run away with Eisenheim, tragedy ensues and so does the many twists and turns of this marvelously filmed movie.<br /><br />Edward Norton as always shines in his role as Eisenheim, his quiet demeanor belying an uncanny knack for revenge; Paul Giamatti is perfect in his role as Chief Inspector Uhl, the Crown Prince's personal law enforcer who sees exposing Eisenheim as a way to advance his career; Jessica Biel radiates a soft beauty as Sophie; and Rufus Sewell chews up the screen villainously as the despicable Crown Prince.<br /><br />THE ILLUSIONIST is a very entertaining movie, and worth viewing.</p></body></html>

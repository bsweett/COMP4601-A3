<meta name="summary" content="Slightly and Only Slightly Better Than the Original"></head><body><p>Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is in hiding.  After successfully evading the CIA in the first film, he and girlfriend Marie (Franka Portente) are living in India.  Jason still doesn't remember very many details about who he is.  But he keeps having dreams that may give him a clue.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's about to be thrust back into the spy game.  A mission is going on in Berlin.  When it goes south, Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) wants answers.  The trail leads to a buried CIA project.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Bourne has started moving again and he trips the radar, bringing the CIA down on him.  Can he figure out why they are suddenly interested in him?  What do his dreams mean?  Will he get another piece of the puzzle of who he is?<br /><br />So I wasn't a fan of the original, but I sat down recently to watch the second one.  My main complaint about the first one was the plot.  It was better here since all the characters behaved believably the entire way through.  The plot was still needlessly confusing, and the characters are still pretty wooden.<br /><br />My biggest complaint this go around is the camera work.  It's shaky the entire way through.  What's worse are the action scenes.  They are so poorly edited it's almost impossible to follow what is happening.  I realize this is a stylistic approach, but it doesn't work.<br /><br />I can see the appeal of the franchise for those who like mindless thrill rides.  But those who look for more then that should approach with caution.</p></body></html>

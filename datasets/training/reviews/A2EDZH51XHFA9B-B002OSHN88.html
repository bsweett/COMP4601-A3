I agree with the sentiment--I'm sure everyone has at least one movie they feel that way about--but for me, its recipient has always been Carol Reed's The Third Man, one of the many fine Graham Greene adaptations that's made its way to the screen (there are some authors whose work seems almost immune from being destroyed by bad adaptations, and Greene may well be one of them; of course, it helps that he adapted this one himself). No less an august body than the BFI called The Third Man the best British film ever produced. I'm not sure I'd go that far, but I just checked my list of the hundred best movies ever made, and only three British films rank higher. (None of them, I'm sure, has ever been mentioned by the BFI in remotely the same breath as this movie; my tastes tend to diverge from the crowd somewhat. And for the record, they're Richard Eyre's Iris (#11), Alan Parker's Pink Floyd: The Wall (#33), and Harry Bromley Davenport's XTRO (#36). The Third Man sits at #38.)<br /><br />Every film on my top 100 list is there for different reasons, but many of them share certain qualities. One of those is rewatchability; with very rare exceptions, it seems to me that one can't truly call a movie great if one can't imagine oneself watching it over and over again as time goes on, always deriving great pleasure from it. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen The Third Man over the years; certainly more than a dozen, probably closer to twoscore. It's a movie that has everything; a fantastic script, wonderful acting, a director and cinematographer who were both at the tops of their respective games, wonderful scenery, and, perhaps most strikingly, a rare star turn from the early career of Orson Welles in a movie he didn't direct.<br /><br />If you've somehow been in a cave for the past sixty years, here's a quick rundown of the plot: Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), a hack writer, is summoned to Vienna, Austria, by his old school friend Harry Lime (Welles), who wants Martins to write some promotional materials for Lime's prescription drug business. Arriving there, however, he gets to Lime's apartment and finds out the man's just been killed in an auto accident. He manages to get to the funeral just in time, where he finds himself embroiled in a game of cat and mouse involving a couple of stiff-upper-lip British military police (Trevor Howard and Bernard Lee), Lime's beautiful girlfriend (Alida Valli), and two of Lime's shadier friends (Ernst Deutsch and Siegfried Breuer). Supposedly, the two friends were with Lime when he died, but the porter in Lime's building swears there was a third man helping to carry the body after the accident; who was the third man? And what if it wasn't an accident at all?<br /><br />This is the kind of mystery that no one knows how to do any more (with the arguable exception of Hideo Nakata, whose Chaos borrows, visually, from The Third Man more than once). Reed unravels the mystery here just as much visually as he does through Martins' detective work. The viewer is expected to pay attention, to see the mystery rather than simply learning about it through the characters' conversations. What was the last Hollywood mystery you saw that did such a thing? Not that a great mystery can't be done conventionally; both The Maltese Falcon and The Usual Suspects come to mind as examples. But The Third Man is, as far as I can tell, unique in the way Reed unfolds the story; it's not enough that Graham Green wrote (and adapted) a cracking good mystery, and that the casting director staffed it with such phenomenal actors, each of whom turns in a stunning performance. It's Reed's visual language that takes this out of the realm of the good and into the realm of the spectacular. Everyone remembers Orson Welles' cuckoo clock speech, to be sure, but everyone also remembers the climactic scene with those fingers sticking out of the sewer grate; how many times have you seen it used in a movie since? It's become part of the language of film. Or Cotten standing at the base of the Ferris wheel? There's a reason is shows up in those best-movies-ever TV shows all the time; it's become iconic. But it's not just those scenes, of course. The entire movie is chock full of incredible images like this. Just rent it, put it on the DVD player, sit back, and enjoy the spectacle of the thing. And if you happen to get caught up in the engrossing story and wowed by the acting, well, that's just icing on the cake sometimes. Graham Greene could turn out a mystery like no other, and The Third Man began the golden age of Carol Reed's career (aside from collaborating once again with Greene on the other best Greene adaptation ever, Our Man in Havana, he was also responsible for such classics as Trapeze, Oliver!, and The Agony and the Ecstasy); there is almost nothing wrong with this movie at all. (The one thing that always nags me, however, is Harry Lime's first spoken lines; Welles always did have a tendency to go for the overly theatrical...) If you've never seen it, run, do not walk, to your nearest video rental store and pick a copy up. One of the hundred best films ever made. **** ?</p></body></html>

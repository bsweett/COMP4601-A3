<meta name="summary" content="Necessary Reminder"></head><body><p>For me, this was a necessary reminder that the world has been dealing with terror tactics a long, long time. I faintly recalled the events with the athletes and the sad story that unfolded, though I was young at the time. We often forget that this is an on-going tragedy around the world and many are at a loss as to how to obtain a solution without becoming just like the terrorists. The film is a good fictional adaptation that was inspired by true events. Though some factual areas had to be a guessing game, it was very well put together.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

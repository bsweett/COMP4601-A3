<meta name="summary" content="A Fabulous Film"></head><body><p>I did not know very much about The Chronicles of Narnia before seeing the film, just the basic thread of the story.  So what I knew of the film and the story I had seen in trailers and a single review that I read.  I found the film to be an extraordinary adventure.  I must confess that not knowing the books when I first saw the trailers I was not at all sure I wanted to see the film.  Seeing is believing, however, and I am hopeful that more of the Narnia books might be filmed.<br /><br />First off, the casting of the film was excellent, particularly the roles of Peter, Edmond, Susan and Lucy.  Also, James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus was really excellent and made a perfect faun.  Perhaps the real stars are the people who produce the CGI effects with Aslan being the star in that area of production.  Voiced by Liam Neeson, Aslan truly comes alive as the noble and self-sacrificing leader that he is.  C. S. Lewis would be impressed, I think, on how well his book has been brought to the screen.  Without CGI Narnia would not be half as spectacular.  There are so many different creatures in Narnia that it was hard to single them all out.<br /><br />The violence of the battle has been commented upon by other reviewers and I agree with those who did not find the scene troubling.  There is less violence than The Lord of the Rings and care was taken to make it as bloodless as possible.  Even the death of the White Witch is off camera.  Certainly, the death of Aslan is a bit of a shock but one has the feeling that something will intervene and bring Aslan back.  The touching concern of Susan and Lucy seems to guarantee that this is not the end.<br /><br />The Chronicles of Narnia is a memorable film that I will recall with pleasure and scenes like the White Witch's first appearance in her sleigh drawn by white reindeer with be etched in my memory.</p></body></html>

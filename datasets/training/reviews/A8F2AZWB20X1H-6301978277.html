<meta name="summary" content="Maybe &quot;nobody's perfect&quot;... but this movie comes close"></head><body><p>This has got to be the most hysterically funny movie ever made.  I almost got carpet burns from rolling on the rug laughing.  Billy Wilder's direction packs a laugh a minute, and shooting the movie in black and white  takes us right back into 1929 Prohibition.  Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are  hilarious as the drag team of Josephine and Daphne on the lam from  witnessing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago, and who else but  Marilyn Monroe could have played the airhead Sugar Kane? As if this trio  wasn't perfection itself, Joe E. Brown almost steals the movie right out  from under them as the superannuated casanova who falls in love with  &quot;Daphne&quot;; maybe he/she is not all Joe E. Brown supposes, but so  what; as Brown says, in the most devastating punchline ever written,  &quot;Nobody's perfect&quot;.  This movie is going to keep viewers cracking  up for generations to come.</p></body></html>

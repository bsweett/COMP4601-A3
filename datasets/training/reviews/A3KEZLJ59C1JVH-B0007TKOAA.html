Paul Giamatti plays Miles, a struggling novelist and wine snob who is disenchanted with his personal and professional life. He went through a painful divorce two years ago and hasn't had a relationship since then. He's also suffocating in his teaching position and is hoping that a publisher will finally accept his manuscript. Then there's Jack (Thomas Haden Church), Miles' best friend from college. Jack is a small-time actor who is getting married in a week, and he and Miles decide to embark on a final "guy trip" and spend a week touring the California vineyards. Miles and Jack are as different as night and day, and while Miles plans on simply having a good time with his friend, Jack fully intends to make the most of his final days of bachelorhood and has only one objective: to get laid.<br /><br />As they explore the vineyards, Miles and Jack encounter two women (Sandra Oh, Virginia Madsen) that they get to know over a series of double-dates. While Jack enjoys his last hurrah before saying "I do," Miles finds light at the end of the tunnel with Maya, a woman who awakens feeling in him that have been dead for a long time. "Sideways" makes clever comparisons between wine and people, and the film explores how individuals and couples evolve over time. This is a very simple movie, but it's definitely one of the best films I've seen in a while. Even though much of the film is bittersweet, there are certain scenes that had me laughing so hard that I cried. (Miles sneaking into that house to retrieve Jack's wallet...priceless!) Watch this movie as soon as you can!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely Amazing"></head><body><p>Magnolia quickly jumped onto my list of all time favorite films.  PT Anderson pulled of an amazing bit of magic with this dark, intense, maddening but oh-so-human collection of souls.  It's length didn't bother me, it's risky plot turns didn't bother me, it profoundly sad scenes did not bother me.  Instead, I felt so full of hope after I saw this film; so convinced in the randomness of life and what you do or don't with it - I was simply blown away.  The performances - all of them - are amazing: Hoffman, J. Moore, Walters, John C., and William H. Macy who is simply astounding.  Really - today there are not many actors better than the troup in this film and each has a chance to strut his/her stuff. I know some people find it tough going or are intimidated by the long running time, but patience here provides an amazing reward.  Just beautiful.</p></body></html>

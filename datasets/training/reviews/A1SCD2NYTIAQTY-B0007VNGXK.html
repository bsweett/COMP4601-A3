Even the paltry Babel Fish of Hitchhikers fame would merely die choking on its own laughter.....or so I thought. I was very pleasantly surprised by the movie "Hellboy" and the overall story that it followed.<br /><br />The main character is a demon, called "Hellboy" (Ron Perlman) funnily enough, who comes through a portal opened by Rasputin, (Karl Roden), at the behest of the desperate Nazis in 1944. After the portal is closed with the help of Professor Broom, (later played by John Hurt), Hellboy is found and becomes the FBI's latest weapon against the "things that go bump in the night". The bad guys come back in the present day to end the world, and they are Rasputin, his girlfriend Ilsa, (Bridget Hodson) and Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, (Ladislav Beran). To add to the mix, Hellboy has a new "babysitter" in Agent John Myers, (Rupert Evans) and a love interest in Liz Sherman, (Selma Blair).<br /><br />Ron Perlman was basically born to play the role of Hellboy, from the basic structure of his face to the very mannerisms and attitudes that Hellboy exudes. Perlman was absolutely stunning in this role, and had the right, sardonic wit to pull it off with class and panache. Even with a huge amount of prosthetic make-up, Perlman was not limited in his expressiveness during the movie. The action scenes were also excellent, and the make-up did not seem to inhibit Perlman's movements at all.<br /><br />Karl Roden brings an intense and deeply emotional Rasputin to the movie, and particularly in the last scenes brings through an intense amount of feeling. However, I would not say that the eerie sense of evilness really came from him. That was really provided by the near-silent Karl Ruprecht Kroenen and his deadly blades. Kroenen is very much the silent type, and mostly communicates through gestures, if at all. The masks that he wears through the movie also add to the inhuman quality of the character, as well as a very quiet, but noticable hissing as he breathes.<br /><br />For the special effects and the set designs, I can only add to the positive comments for this movie. The dark feel of the movie was excellent and added to the sense of forboding that was brought by some characters. Also, the achievements of the effects team were really stunning, and what they managed to do with various everyday items has been great. Also, the robotics and so on have been excellently executed and have only added to the movie's overall feel and atmosphere.<br /><br />The 2-disc set provides some interesting information on both the making of the film and various characters as well. I found them to be very informative and well set out. If you do not want to wade through stuff that is not interesting to you, you can go straight to that section, rather than watch the entire "Making Off..." thing.<br /><br />For action and a good story that combines history, fantasy, Hell, magic, and some very interesting characters, "Hellboy" is pretty hard to pass up. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it, including the Samaritan, which "uses really big bullets."</p></body></html>

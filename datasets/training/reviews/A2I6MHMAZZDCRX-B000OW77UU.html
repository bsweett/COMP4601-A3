<meta name="summary" content="Not at all Happi"></head><body><p>Will Smith is the main reason I went to see this film.  He stars as Chris Gardner.  Back in 1981, his life was hard.  His girlfriend/wife (I've heard both, and the movie never makes it clear) is working double shifts to support the two of them and their son Christopher (Jaden Smith).  Chris, meanwhile, is working as hard has he can to sell bone density machines.  He's already bought them, so he needs to sell them to get his life savings back.<br /><br />One day, he happens to meet a successful stock broker.  Chris is fascinated by the wealth this guy has, so he begins to pursue it as a new career, not knowing all the stress that is involved.  He learns of an internship offered by Dean Witter, and tries to get into the program despite his lack of formal education.<br /><br />Meanwhile, his life is going downhill.  His landlord is tired of waiting for the rent and his wife decides to leave for New York.  Can he balance being a single dad with a spot in this competitive internship?<br /><br />The first strike against the movie is the trailer.  That's right.  If you've seen the trailer, you've seen this movie.  I half expected that when I went to see it, so that's not my main complaint.<br /><br />I went to the film expecting an inspiring true story.  I got a true story.  While the theme "If you work hard, you can accomplish anything" does come out, the movie focuses on all the struggles.  It got depressing long before the end with very little to balance it out.<br /><br />And, of course, there are Chris's actions.  While I did spend most of the film rooting for him to succeed, there were times it was hard.  He risked too much since he had to care for his son.  And he didn't seem to be able to keep track of his machines either.<br /><br />What I can't fault is Will Smith's performance.  He is a powerful actor who does an excellent job bringing Chris to life.  Jaden Smith does a decent job playing the son, he good but certainly not the next big child star.  Their bond was touching and provided some of the lighter moments.<br /><br />I really had looked forward to this movie, but in the end was highly disappointed.</p></body></html>

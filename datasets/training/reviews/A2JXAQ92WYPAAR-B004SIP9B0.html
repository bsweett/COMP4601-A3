<meta name="summary" content="Helen Mirren, Queen of England"></head><body><p>I remember seeing Helen Mirren years ago in an odd thing called "O Lucky Man." A wonderful film actually, but not terribly well-known, I guess. Anyway, it was a time in British film when actresses were expected to go topless so, like Glenda Jackson and the rest of her generation, dear, sweet Helen had to run around half-naked. Of course, viewers loved it. The point is that Ms Mirren has always been a daring, courageous actress, and I suspect it took a lot of guts for her to do the Queen. She is good, and the film isn't bad, although I suspect it will be remembered chiefly for the performances. The story is compelling, but the conflict seems very particular to its time, a unique and disturbing moment, but not one that points to universals. I can't help thinking that she deserves far more interesting roles. Like Guilgud, the great Shakespearean actor, if I am not mistaken, Mirren has Slavic (Russian?) blood in her, which perhaps explains her capacity for extraordinary passion. In this picture, it is all contained and repressed. I'd like to see it exposed.</p></body></html>

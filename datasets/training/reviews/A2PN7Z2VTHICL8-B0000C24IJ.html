<meta name="summary" content="Inbreeding in West Virginia?  Noooooo!"></head><body><p>Chris Finn is late for an appointment and stops at a gas station to use the phone (doesn't work) and checks out a map that shows a dirt road that leads around the large traffic jam blocking the only highway to his destination.  Taking this backwoods shortcut, a short way up the road he literally runs into another vehicle in the middle of the road.  Two couples and the requisite single female are stranded there when their car ran over a strand of barbed wire seemingly placed in the road on purpose.  Finn, the single woman, and one of the couples leave the scene of the accident to try and find assistance, leaving the other couple behind at their vehicle.<p>Now we have the formula of city folks looking for excitement in the country both stranded and divided, in the backwoods of West Virginia.  Why would anyone look for a phone where there are no power lines whatsoever?  Simple, to create this kind of suspense in a slasher/thriller movie in which the blood will soon fly and the city folks soon die.<p>Spectacular mutants, a squealing stupid girl, stupidly brave and clueless men, and some nice knife and axe work blend together to give us this bloodily entertaining movie with just the right allotments of gore, cheese, and stupidity.  Definitely entertaining splatter for those who appreciate the genre.<p>Mmmmmmm.  Long Pork.  Don't check the fridge for any snacks!</p></body></html>

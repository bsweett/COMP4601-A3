<meta name="summary" content="Stepchild of the Pixar Family"></head><body><p>Like every single one of Pixar's films, this was witty, beautiful and genuine, but in the end felt like light fare compared to some of the studio's masterworks. It didn't have the suspense of The Incredibles, the heart of Up or the scale of Wall-E, for example, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy it. The script had a few legit family-friendly laughs and the animation had some moments of inspiration, (I really liked the visualizations of competing/combining flavors) and it gets points for trying out a unique setting but this never really had that moment where everything shifted into overdrive. Ah, well. My least favorite Pixar effort is still better than most of the competition.</p></body></html>

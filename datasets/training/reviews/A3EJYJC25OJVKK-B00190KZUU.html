<meta name="summary" content="A fascinating movie!"></head><body><p>I unfortunately never got a chance to see this movie while it was playing at the movie theatres and it's a real bummer because "Big Fish" is a really amazingly well done movie and one of the greatest movies of 2003. I was lured into seeing this film after reading and hearing all of the great reviews that this film got and let me tell you, this movie deserves all of the great reviews that it gets. Another thing that also made me want to see this was that it was directed by Tim Burton, one of my all time favorite directors. In fact, even as high of expectations that I had, this movie surpassed even those. <p> "Big Fish" is the tale of an elderly father named Edward Bloom. Edward and his son William have never really gotten along very well. Edward has told his son William about his eccentric and highly adventurous life during his younger years to his son when he was a child but William however found it to be too `fantasy-oriented' and wants to hear Edward's `real' story without resorting to talking like it's a `fantasy' world. After it turned into an argument the two became estranged for over three years but  Edward has fallen ill to a terminal illness and Will returns to see him and learn about his past. Flashing back into Edwards younger days, the movie showcases all of the fun not to mention outrageously adventurous things Edward did during his younger days. <p> This movie is just absolutely amazing but it's also a mix of tears and laughter as it's one of the most bittersweet movies that I've ever watched. Tim Burton who usually showcased his trademark with his generally macabre natured movies completely takes a U-Turn and replaces the Halloween styles with a more southern classic atmosphere and he as a result breaks new ground in his career and it works almost perfectly.  Burton on a directing note, hits another home run right out of the park on this movie as well. The story is just stellar and brings out incredible depth to the father/son dynamic.<p> The acting by the entire cast was absolutely stellar especially by Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom and also by Albert Finney as the much older Edward. The movie plot is just fun and not to mention heartbreaking yet funny all at the same time. It will leave you happy yet wanting to cry at the same time. This movie is so much fun and so emotional that I literally did not want it to end. It's that Good! <p> Quite frankly, this is one of the best movies of 2003 and I strongly recommend that you buy this DVD as soon as possible because it is worth the money and I plan on watching it at least 500 more times!</p></body></html>

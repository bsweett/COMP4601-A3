<meta name="summary" content="BIG BUDGET POOP !"></head><body><p>The new remake of "The Amityville Horror" plays very much like the other recent cheap hollywood flops such as "The Boogyman" & Wes Craven's "Cursed" they all start off great & then belly flop into unbearable cheese. Alot like "The Boogyman" Amityville has plenty going for it & then it just craps out in the end. The original is better even without all the new special efx! Imagine what it would've looked like if they did have the same technology back then!</p></body></html>

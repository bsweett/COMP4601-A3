<meta name="summary" content="MIDLIFE HORMONE ROMP WITH THE WARM LILT OF URBAN CLUELESSNESS"></head><body><p>I loved this film. But I recognize it's not for everyone.<br /><br />The theme reeks of an Ordinary People -- a pot-bellied Kevin Costner shacks up with his friend's abandoned wife (Joan Allen) to guzzle sixpacks like their plane is going down. Thus brews a school-girlish game of attraction, complete with giggles and hiding in the backyard, punctuated in parts by digressions of Allen's four daughters and some choice characters with varying levels of relevance to the theme.<br /><br />Recapping this moments-film would work as much as it would for the ilk of American Beauty or Ice Storm. Cheeky homages to urban cluelessness, studies of ordinary people in ordinary towns facing ordinary problems.<br /><br />But there's an extraordinary flair, a rhythm, to the way their stories are told. You keep watching because you relate to the characters and mull over their predicament long after the credits have rolled. The bookish narration may be one downside, you think, but traces of good humor and some taut acting all round are surely the upsides of anger and they make up handsomely.<br /><br />One for the discerning types. You may want to skip it if the relaxed rhythm of movies like Sideways or American Beauty ticks you off, but I recommend it to people with a taste for nuanced cinema.</p></body></html>

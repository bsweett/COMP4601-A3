<meta name="summary" content="Another Eastwood classic"></head><body><p>I can understand why many people may feel that Mystic River is overrated, but I disgress.  Everything about the film, from the performances from the entire cast, to Clint Eastwood's super slick direction, is flawless.  Taking place in working class Boston and revolving around three childhood friends in Jimmy (Sean Penn), Dave (Tim Robbins), and Sean (Kevin Bacon); all three of whom are seperated after a tragedy involving Dave, and the murder of Jimmy's teenage daughter years later re-unites them as the clues point to Dave being the perpetraitor while Sean, now a cop, scrambles to stop former thug Jimmy from taking the law into his own hands.  The performances are nothing short of superb, with Penn and Robbins both earning their Oscars, and Marcia Gay Harden (as Dave's wife) earning her Oscar nod.  Eastwood's moody score and Oscar winning screenwriter Brian Helgeland keep the film twisting, the only problem being Helgeland's script doesn't go as in depth as Dennis Lehane's novel, but he did a more than commendable job nonetheless.  This overpriced Special 3-disc edition is scant on the extras, and while Eastwood's score is included, you'd think that he would have done a commentary at least.  That aside though, this is still a fabulous film, and more than worth seeing.</p></body></html>

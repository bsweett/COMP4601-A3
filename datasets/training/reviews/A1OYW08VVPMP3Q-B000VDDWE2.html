My Dad and I just started laughing at the helicopter freezing up in mid-flight because the fuel started to solidify. My Dad was also an aircraft mechanic and although oil can get sludgy at low temps freezing aviation fuel is almost impossible outside a laboratory. But of course this is explained by some weird new weather phenomena that comes about in a matter of days, apparently.<br /><br />The best part was the United States having to ask permission of Mexico to cross their border. I could almost hear Rik from the Young Ones saying "take that, fascist bully-boy!" Please. This thing is a politically correct fable from beginning to end. How else could you explain freezing hurricanes being the result of... global warming?</p></body></html>

The three main characters romp through Amsterdam and points beyond, seeking and seeing nothing but naked women who might make themselves available with absolutely no strings. We glimpse what's intended to be the famous red-light district of the Netherlands, but the film really turns the whole landscape into one big red-light district.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino and the others who give the generally giggling, juvenile DVD commentary on the film, have one brief moment of realization. One of them tosses out the idea that the film is an example of what goes around, comes around. He remarks that the young men start out exploiting women, then end up being themselves exploited in far darker ways in the horror house where they end up.<br /><br />But then the commentators giggle on, showing that no such moral has sunk in very deep with them. And it seems certain that their point in making this movie was certainly not to provide any illustration of poetic justice. Their point in making the movie just seems to have been to make some bucks by getting a writhing of soft-core porn (verging on hard-core) out there on the screen.<br /><br />The actor who plays the prime villain does a good job and provides a few good presaging moments - as he talks about his gustatory preferences. Other than that, this movie is a waste of time unless you are into porn. And then you'd be better off just going into the adult section and being done with it.</p></body></html>

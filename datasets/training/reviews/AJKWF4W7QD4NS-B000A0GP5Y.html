It'd be even harder to imagine a remake of the classic prison football film with Adam Sandler posing for Burt Reynolds.  Well, it became a reality, and just like you'd expect, the remake of the Longest Yard is a lame and needless remake of a classic.  Sandler plays disgraced NFLer Paul "Wrecking" Crewe, who finds himself in jail for quite some time.  The warden (James Cromwell) wants Crewe to assemble a team of prisoners to play his guards (led by William Fichtner) in a one-sided football game, which just so happens will be broadcast on ESPN.  Yeah, the Longest Yard is about as mainstream and product placement filled as anyone with operating brain cells can expect, and the supposedly funny and comic moments just come off as tiresome and, well, lame.  Yeah, that word has popped up a lot in this review, but I can't think of a more fitting word that suits this crud remake.  Not to mention the just plain unnecessary racist remarks to come from the guards in attempting to goad the running back (Nelly) into a fight.  The only thing that saves this crummy remake is Reynolds himself who shows up as the coach of Crewe's team, as well as a somewhat spirited performance from Chris Rock.  Not to mention that it's kind of fun to see many ex-NFLer's and greats like Michael Irvin, Bob Sapp, Bill Romanowski, and Brian Bosworth as the guards, as well as pro wrestlers like Bill Goldberg, Steve Austin, and Kevin Nash to boot.  Other than that though, saying that you're better off with the original Longest Yard is quite the understatement.</p></body></html>

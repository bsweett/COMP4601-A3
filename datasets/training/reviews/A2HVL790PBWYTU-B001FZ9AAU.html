<meta name="summary" content=""Is this the last act of defiance from Tony Stark?""></head><body><p>Finally, Marvel Comics' ol' Shellhead arrives on the big screen, and he arrives with stunning force. I don't quite know if this is the best superhero film ever made, but IRON MAN's just about got me convinced that it at least ranks right up there with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMQW">Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNJV">Batman Begins (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and the first two SUPERMAN movies, with Christopher Reeve (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059Z8J">Superman - The Movie</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IJ79V6">Superman II (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>). Everything seems to have fallen into place for IRON MAN, from the knocked-out-of-the-park special effects to the well-written script, brought to life by a high caliber cast. It's just a good story told very well. And, as a bonus, it's surprisingly funny.<br /><br />Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) has got it all, riches and notoriety and an off-the-charts genius I.Q. A debonair gazillionaire who inherited Starks Industries, Stark has been content breezing thru his days as a freewheeling playboy/inventor. Swanky pad in Malibu. Fancy private jet with gorgeous stewardesses doubling as pole dancers. When asked to justify his company's role as the military's primary weapons provider, his flippant response is "Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."<br /><br />But his worldview is forever altered when he goes to the Middle East for a weapons presentation. Terrorists blow up his vehicle, the resulting explosion causing shrapnel to be imbedded in his chest, very close to his heart. A makeshift electromagnetic device (hooked to a car battery) is implanted in his chest cavity, to prevent the shrapnel from piercing his heart. The terrorists, who hail Tony as the most famous mass murderer in America, insist that he build missiles for them. Accordingly, Tony is kept in a cave and given access to scrap metal and missile parts. But, Tony Stark, with nothing left to lose, decides to build something else...<br /><br />This film is awesome, definitely a fan boy's giddy dream. IRON MAN brings the thunder, delivers the goods. There are so many highlight, pump-you-up moments here, to relish and hoot and holler for. The first appearance of the clunky Iron Man armor. The first time he takes flight. Tony's step-by-step (and often hilarious) development of the new, sleeker model. The first time the new model goes into action. And much, much more. Let me just say, eyeing schematics have never been so much fun. It's pretty contagious, the sheer fun and enjoyment experienced by Tony as he goes about putting together his armor. His underground lab is an eye-popping marvel of hi-tech gadgetry, which includes an artificial intelligence named Jarvis (in the comics, Jarvis is an all-too human butler of Tony's and the Avengers'). And when Iron Man finally truimphantly blazes thru the skies in ridiculous velocities - well, whew! No complaints at all, at all with how the Iron Man armors are imagined on screen. Prepare to get blown away.<br /><br />IRON MAN is peopled by stock characters, no lie. The faithful, beautiful long-suffering, long-in-love assistant. The backstabbing business partner. The terrorists. Even the hero of the film isn't cut from a new cloth (uncaring industrialist undergoing a moral 180). But here's the thing: when these cliches are played by the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and Robert Downey, Jr., well, then, the cardboard suddenly gains layers of depth.<br /><br />Iron Man had always been so far down my list of favorite superheroes, it's kind of pathetic. Before this film, I've never found him that interesting in the comic books. Too cold, too smug, too superior, too powerful...Plus, if you've been following the recent Civil War crossover event in the Marvel comics, Iron Man, in my eyes, played a very distasteful role. But Iron Man on screen is something else. On celluloid, he's dynamic and dazzling and oh so friggin' cool! But the thing that really puts it all together, that which makes this flick such a hands down winner and a box office monster, is Robert Downey, Jr. Downey brings his fabulous acting, his jaded charisma and his comic wit and timing to the role. And to see him breathe life into Tony Stark is to think "Yes, of course!" - the man fits the part so seamlessly. Still handsome, but there's a well worn look to him now. Downey's done stuff and lived life outrageously, good and bad. And, really, that's Tony Stark to a T. Even more than Tobey Maguire is Spider-Man, Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man. For an actor who's had his ups and downs and for a brilliant formerly heartless ex-weaponeer who's literally had a change of heart, redemption comes in rip-roaring heavy metal...</p></body></html>

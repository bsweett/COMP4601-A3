Starsky played by Owen Wilson is definatly in a turnaround in this role, as he usually plays the rather clueless and brainless man of the hour. Point in case I Spy and the shangia noon/knight series.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is as always Ben Stiller, no more, no less. The movie is a crackup, there is just no two ways about it. Snoop Dogg is an interesting character, although I was a bit on the clueless side about his role. It think they needed to explain what he was just a little bit better. fashion statement or detective. Or both. I'm not sure.<br /><br />One of the best parts of the film is where Starsky and Hutch break into the enemy's territory by playing Mime's. Wherewith the mimeless Starsky tells the crowd that he'll do the climbing wall motion one more time. Watch it, you'll see what I mean.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A four star Depp performance"></head><body><p>&quot;Secret WIndow&quot; is a slight but entertaining little thriller best approached with lowered expectations. It's based on a Stephen King short story/novella, about a popular author accused of plagiarism by a murderous creep with an oily pallor and a dripping drawl.<br /><br /> The single reason to see this film is to catch yet another delightful performance by Johnny Depp. This guy is truly amazing...his portrayals are full of details and quirks that flesh out the characters in ways other actors can't. They try, but they always look like they're trying.<br /><br /> The supporting cast, Maria Bello, Timothy Hutton, Charles S. Dutton and a wicked John Turturro, are fine...but you really can't take your eyes off Depp. He clearly elevates the material.<br /><br /> David Koepp's script makes the most out of a difficult adaptation, and his direction is unexpectedly impressive. Inventive but always servicing the story...it's the second best thing about the film. He sets the mood, keep the atmosphere tense, surprises you here and there...<br /><br /> Give this film a chance, and you just might be pleasantly surprised.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="X-cellent"></head><body><p>Great film with Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman in excellently-casted rolls in X-men.  <p>Hugh Jackman is particularly suited to his role of Wolverine with his dark, brooding looks and wonderful, biting sarcasm.<p>It's not a deep film, but it's based on a comic book for crying out loud so enjoy it AS one!<p>Only complaint with the film is that &quot;mutant hatred&quot; does not seem to be well-depicted...unless you count the handful of people with picket signs.  Big deal.</p></body></html>

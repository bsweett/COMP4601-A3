I must say that after watching it, I would not place this in the fantasy genre. I mean, it has it's fantastical elements, but when you get down to it, it's more of a friendship film with a great imagination. The two leads do a remarkable job portraying middle school kids who form a type of bond dealing with an imaginary world. Its actually very sweet and sentimental. That aspect of the film really is what makes it worthwhile. I found that when they introduce the fantasy elements, the film lost it's trail of thought. I'm aware this is based off a book, and maybe the book portrays things better. But as a film, it doesn't quite work. Still worth a look. It does have an unexpected ending which caught me off guard. Its a very bittersweet sort of film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mel Gibson brings on the action!"></head><body><p>Mel Gibson has always been a very powerful actor when he plays a father or a hero. In these types of movies, his characters always have just cause for revenge and extensive displays of either muted or expressed emotion. &quot;Braveheart&quot; allowed him to indulge in his leadership qualities, while playing a very emotional role. &quot;Ransom&quot; allows him to play the part of a caring and loving husband and father, which he does extremely well. &quot;The Patriot,&quot; his latest movie, is yet another chance for him to show these character traits in fine form, matching his performance in &quot;Braveheart.&quot; Gibson gives us an emotionally charged performance as the main character, proving his worth in Hollywood. <p>And the movie itself isn't that bad, either. I have found that many historians and buffs have criticized the movie for its lack of authenticity, but if you don't have a clear knowledge of the events of the time period, or you can set aside your need for the true facts, then the movie works on the basis of its emotional and surprising plot. It's one of those feel-good movies where you know what is going to happen, and then the ending is completely different. It can be a bit trying at times, due to its length, and will test the patience of many viewers, but the material is solid and ends up pleasing us. <p>Taking place during the Revolutionary War, the story begins in a day in the life of Benjamin Martin, who lives peacefully in his South Carolina home with his five sons and two daughters. As the battle between the statesman and the British becomes heated, Martin's son, Gabriel, takes up arms, despite his father's opposition to the war. Gibson, along with Heath Ledger, have a unique father/son chemistry onscreen that is believable and emotional, hitting home for those interested in this aspect of the plot. Their bond strengthens once Gabriel returns, soon followed by a brigade of British soldiers. Their home is burned, Gabriel is taken away, but not before his brother is killed in trying to save him. <p>The movie takes on a bit of the &quot;Braveheart&quot; incentive for Gibson's character here, as Martin's son's death sparks him into action, leading him to victory over the soldiers holding Gabriel hostage. He and Gabriel soon begin forming a group of rebels in a Militia against the British soldiers, as the cunning and ruthless Colonel William Tavington closes in on &quot;The Ghost&quot; responsible for the dent in the King's Army. Martin and his men ride to many victories, keeping their honor and their dignity, but soon, Martin realizes that he will have to face the armies of the British head on in order to protect his family, now under the care of their Aunt Charlotte. <p>The movie has the overall look and feel of a big, booming epic, and while it's not up to scale such as past films like &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;Titanic,&quot; it still is good, rousing entertainment for mass audiences. It has many elements which will appeal to many different demographics, one of which is two separate romances that build within the movie's plot. One involves Gabriel, who falls in love with and marries a girl from a small town. Their relationship also provides some comical relief, mostly in the parents, who react just like today's parents would if their daughter were in love (though I don't think too many people sew their daughter's boyfriends into straight-jackets). The other romance involves Benjamin and Charlotte, his deceased wife's sister. The relationship between these two characters may be taken as controversial to some; I mean, come on, what are the kids supposed to think? She's their aunt, but the movie never dives too heavily into this relationship, so we're never given enough time to really think about it. <p>Another contributor to the movie's epic feel is the grand photography and cinematography, headed by photographer Caleb Deschanel, who brings lots of beauty and slow motion to the movie to bring us into the action as well as surrounding us with the unseen beauty of nature. By unseen, I mean that those involved in the battle never lament over nature's beauty, and it seems to close in on them at times, surrounding them with noises of crickets in the night, or green leaves of brush and trees. Lighting plays a key factor in certain scenes, most notably during the raid on Charlotte's house, adding a sense of heightened suspense to the moment. Slow motion strengthens the display of the horrors of war, which are vastly displayed in graphic shots, giving us all the brutality of the Revolutionary War. <p>The story, while relying on some formulaic elements, also keeps the movie's epic appearance up, following the trials and tribulations of a man whose life is in danger every minute of the movie's most intense moments. Martin's story, while being fictional, is quite moving, powerful and emotional. Benjamin has his values, which makes him an admirable character, and his children are embodied with those values, which makes the bond between father and family very strengthened and moving. <p>The historical aspect of the movie is going to be a factor of controversy among everyone who sees this movie that knows what really went on during the Revolutionary War. People will say that the historical aspect is authentic and makes sense to the movie, while others will say it is a cheap attempt to bring the war to life with a fictional story for its premise. I, myself, do not know off the top my head anything about the Revolutionary War, and that is why I enjoyed this movie as I did because I don't have to worry about criticizing it for its accuracy or inaccuracy. For me, everything else in this movie works, so I was able to find it satisfying. <p>Just as Gibson gives his powerhouse performance, the rest of the cast also gives us stellar performances that add heart and feel to the movie. Heath Ledger, who starred in &quot;10 Things I Hate About You,&quot; takes on a very adult role in this movie, and does so with ease. He never flinches, and his performance never falls short. Jason Isaacs plays Colonel William Tavington, who is pompous, arrogant and ruthless in his war tactics. He brings all of this and more to the role. Joely Richardson is Charlotte, strong and gentle, who cares for Benjamin's children and with whom she shares a strong chemistry, even if briefly. Other actors include Chris Cooper, Tcheky Karyo, Rene Auberjonois and Tom Wilkinson. <p>While not the best epic ever made, &quot;The Patriot&quot; is by no means a failure, and its integrity, emotion, strength and intelligence all make it worthwhile in watching. The overall effect one feels after watching this movie is one of satisfaction, and that is more than most movies can account for. It dazzles the senses while keeping us intrigued by the story of one man's struggle to free his family from oppression.</p></body></html>

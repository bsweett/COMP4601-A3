<meta name="summary" content="Very dark, very violent"></head><body><p>A fairy tale this may be, but do we really have to see a man's face being cut open, a leg being cut off, lingering shots of hypodermic needles being stuck in bodies or a man sewing his lip up with a sewing needle? Aside from these squirm-inducing moments, this Spanish film lingers longer in WW2 reality than in fantasy. I wished for more interludes in the underground world, and fewer in the present when we must watch sadistic Fascist soldiers killing and torturing Spanish rebels. There's a lot of blood here, and this is certainly not a great movie for kids. Still, worth a watch if you enjoy a slight departure from Hollywood's inanities.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HULK VERY GOOD, BUT HULK NOT GREAT! 3 1/2 STARS!"></head><body><p>I wanted to love this movie, but ended up just a little disappointed. The story is interesting, but the films pacing is uneven. It does capure some of the feel of the comic book and I thought the CGI Hulk looked good most of the time. I didn't mind the Hulk being CGI, but why did they changed the original story so much?<br /><br />Changing Dr. Banner from a meek book worm into a typical leading man was not the wisest decision. There was no contrast between the two alter egos and this could have been used to there advantage throughout the film. I also felt the story was a bit long sometime tedious. I also thought making the hulk grow to 15 feet was a little too big, it made it even harder to believe those purple pants could stretch that much. When the Hulk was on screen, this film is full of great Hulk action, I loved the desert scene when The Hulk is running towards the tank!<br /><br />In the end, while I liked this film, it ;eft a lot of room for improvement. There was enough going for it, to overlook some of the flaws, but this could have been a really good movie with a few tweaks here and there.<br /><br />I had invisioned a movie like the original Frankenstein or King Kong with a misunderstood monster that just wanted to be left alone......Too Bad. Maybe they can fix the damage with a sequel,....lets hope so! :-(</p></body></html>

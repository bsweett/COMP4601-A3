<meta name="summary" content="Never liked X-men"></head><body><p>I don't really like the theme of X-men of comparing these people with special abilities to Jews in Nazi Germany as they are different.<br /><br />Having said that, this story is probably the best one of the lot. The acting was good. The story flowed quite well. The action scenes were interesting.</p></body></html>

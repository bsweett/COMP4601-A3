<meta name="summary" content="A Surefire Treat Of Iron."></head><body><p>This Film is a winner i've seen it twice, it's a must see this summer. now they actually made a good apt from a comic book finally . spidey was good but this one has a better balance of being light and funny plus dramatic for all around fun treat. The  cast is just excellent, props to the person that did the casting for this picture.  Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges the acting muse must have been on their side because the acting is just aces. the most enjoyable film i've in quite sometime.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />P.S. when  i first heard about this film i was think the worst, the  film proved me wrong i love it. oh you must sit through the credits to see a surprise at the end. this won't be the last time i view this film i'll probably end up going again to see it. fun. It's PG-13 For Some Language , Brief Mild Sexually, and Violence/Action Scenes.</p></body></html>

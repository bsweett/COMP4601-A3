<meta name="summary" content="One of the best Trek films to date!"></head><body><p>Clearly Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan is, in my opinion, one of the best Star Trek films.  It certainly did a lot more to please long time fans and draw in new ones, than did The Motion Picture.  Drawing on a very powerful character from the original episode, Khan Noonien Singh. Ricardo Montalban delivers a powerful performance.  William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForrest Kelly and all the other original characters do a wonderful job of bringing their characters to life in this film.<p>The Director's Edition is a true joy, containing everything that should've been put on this DVD when it was originally released.  Being an avid fan of the Star Trek books, the feature with Greg Cox (one of the best trek authors) and Julia Ecklar (half of the LA Graf writing team) was a pure joy.  Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan is a pure Sci-Fi, genre masterpiece and the Director's Edition DVD is a must for your collection!</p></body></html>

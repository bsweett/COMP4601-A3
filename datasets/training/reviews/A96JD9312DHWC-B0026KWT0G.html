Camp Crystal Lake, an area stretching just over four square miles, had been the sight of eight grotesque murders, with the media speculating over rumors of mutilations and cannibalism that had followed in suite. Still, and ending had been achieved. As is the case with many a primal killing machine, however, one blow is often not enough to do the deed - especially if that blow is to the lower neck on the back of the aggressor - and Jason was left with the ability to breath, thereby allowing him to heal and start again. Enter a van loaded with seven occupants on their way to a secluded home just outside of Crystal Lake, lead by a former introductee to Mr. Vorhees scarred by the run-in and who wants to confront and vanquish those demons. Well, her friends are there for her like good friends should be, and they opt to journey into the seclued home where the deed took place to have fun/ be there for her. On the way there they are confronted by an elderly gentlemen that tells them, amidst his insane rambling, that they are all in peril and to flee, but this is a time for fun and sun so they ignore this herald and continue on with their troubled colleague. Yes, her friends are there for her, until the would-be fun turns into a nightmare and then the dying times begin.<p>While showing some signs of aging in the world of more modern effectual bliss, the movie still has some strong points in the ways of slasher flicks and is the portion of the Friday the 13th legacy that introduced a icon into the fold. That's because it was here, amidst the suffering introduced to many a victim, that the persona of Jason was adopted and his mask was found. Still, that's only one of the points I liked about the movie. Personally, I enjoy the drawn out stalking that takes place as Jason plays cat-and-mouse in those early days, letting the audience familiarize themselves with his potential victims before the killing begins. This lets personalities develop amongst the troops, showcasing two chronically abusive merrymen as they seek out high after high, a local countryboy, the damaged damsel, the two lovers that are expecting, the jerk/prankster, and the somewhat stuck-up blind date as they wander toward that machete-toting brick wall. Combine this with the fact that there are plenty of other disposable portions of suffering to pad the scenes, letting the mind do a little shopping and follow a few bikers into the realms of attitude correction, and you have yourself a funderland of experiences.<p>If you've seen other Friday the 13ths and you are looking for some of the more serious slasher times, then this is one of introduction points. The effects aren't the best here and the storyline does have its holes, but the characters tend to find ways to overcome that and the ending chase and the damage that ensues in the end more than make up for it. Its like a fun-loving romp, with scissors!</p></body></html>

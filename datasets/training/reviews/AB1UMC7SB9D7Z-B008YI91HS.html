Check.<br /><br />Great character development that makes us care about them as they fall further and further into danger? Check.<br /><br />Crisp, clean directing and editing that is not only state of the art, but really hasn't been surpassed visually very much in the past decade? Check.<br /><br />Awesome, believable acting? Check.<br /><br />Commentary about the nature of science to add depth to the storyline? Check.<br /><br />A bunch of scientists are invited to Jurassic Park, a zoological exhibition that is a little different... John Hammond, its creater, has genetically engineered dinosaurs from isolated DNA strands from prehistoric mosquitos trapped in fossilized amber. He invites the scientists so that they may endorse his park to open it to the public, but a greedy computer engineer and other problems soon let the dinosaurs out of their cages, endangering the island's visitors and creating an unforgettable special effects adventure.<br /><br />Time is slowly outdating the science in this science fiction adventure, but the graphics and action are brilliantly done and very realistic, keeping the realism at the essence of the suspense still gripping. It also contains some of the best performances ever put into a summer blockbuster. Everything as large as a brachiosaurus and small as a little hand gesture are finely crafted by everyone involved into perfection.<br /><br />It's a movie that shall never go extinct.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></body></html>

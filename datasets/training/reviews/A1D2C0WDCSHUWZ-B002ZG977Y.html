<meta name="summary" content="Not very Titanic"></head><body><p>"Clash of the Titans" is a truly amazing film -- never before have I seen a movie that is so BUSY, and yet so staggeringly DULL.<br /><br />This stupid movie was apparently made to cash in on the wild success of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QXDED6">300</a>, but it pretty much missed everything that made that movie enjoyable. Instead, this remake of the classic cult film is full of everything and nothing -- Louis Leterrier crams it with horrible acting, endless CGI, and an obnoxiously preachy plot that ends up being brain-bleedingly boring.<br /><br />A fisherman finds a floating coffin, which holds a dead princess and a still-living baby. He adopts the child, Perseus (Sam Worthington), and raises him as well -- until the god Hades (Ralph Fiennes) destroys Perseus' family and fishing boat. He's marched to the city of Argos, where he sees the king and queen declare war on the gods...<br /><br />... only to have Hades proclaim that if Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is not sacrificed within ten days, the kraken will destroy Argos. A mysterious woman named Io  (Gemma Arterton) tells Perseus that he is actually the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), and is the only hope of slaying the kraken and saving Argos.<br /><br />Honestly, the story of Perseus is one of the awesomest, most movieworthy stories in Greek mythology -- you've got a demigod hero, a sea monster, a flying horse, and a snake-headed creature that turns people to stone. But apparently, THAT story isn't good enough for the people in Hollywood. They even mock the original movie in one scene involving the mechanical owl Bubo.<br /><br />Instead director Leterrier crams all sorts of weird random stuff into the movie -- it's a constant onslaught of giant scorpions, CGI monsters, djinni, and witches who look like Guillermo del Toro discards. The plot feels skeletal and bloated at the same time, with horribly silly dialogue ("It is death who should be afraid of us!") and dozeworthy action scenes.<br /><br />Even worse, the screenwriters seem hell-bent on pushing their own theological philosophy on us ("God sucks and ruins everything, so don't worship him") NON-STOP. There's scene after scene of "We hate the gods! Gods are awful! Let's stupidly anger them even though they're incredibly powerful!"... only for them to undermine their own message in the last reel.<br /><br />And really, how can you go wrong when you have Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in your movie, playing GODS? Well, you can cast the bland lump that is Sam Worthington as your lead, a pouting prettyboy who brings no charisma to his role, giving Neeson nothing to do except throw divine tantrums and Fiennes nothing to do except slink around being vaguely sinister (since a god of death HAS to be evil, right? WRONG!). As for Gemma Arterton, she just sort of wanders in and out of the story, serving as a source of convenient information.<br /><br />"Clash of the Titans" would be better titled "Flush of the Titans" -- a reeking lump of brainless cinema that stupefies even as it preaches. The original is flawed, but infinitely superior to this one.</p></body></html>

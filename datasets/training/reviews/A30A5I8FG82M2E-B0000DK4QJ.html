<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg's Best, a new sci-fi masterpiece"></head><body><p>I'm not kidding, this is hands down the best motion picture that Mr. Spielberg has delivered us yet.  It eclipses his previous best, which of course was &quot;Close Encounters&quot; (hey, being second on that list is like being above first on anyone elses list!).<p>I'm told that there are tons of special features on this edition.  Those familiar with my reviews already know this:  I don't give a shucky-darn about DVD features.  Give me the movie with the best picture and audio quality possible.  Does &quot;Minority Report&quot; succeed on these levels?  Without a doubt.<p>Tom Cruise hasn't been this good in a long time.  Samantha Morton was robbed of an Academy Award nomination for her work here as the main 'precog'.  Don't know what a 'precog' is?  You need to see this movie!  The effects will boggle the mind of even the most jaded moviegoer.  You've never seen anything like this!  With &quot;A.I.&quot;, Mr. Spielberg was said to be channelling the spirit of the late Stanley Kubrick.  True, but equally true here.  No, the late Mr. Kubrick had nothing to do with this film, but the influence is simply undeniable.</p></body></html>

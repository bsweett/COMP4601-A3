<meta name="summary" content="Desperado."></head><body><p>Desperado is an ok movie, little overdone,excessive violence and near impossible things happening. It's worth watching for Selma Hayek. It's long,and at times pointless.dvd has no special features and the main screen looks like it was homemade.dreadful music too.</p></body></html>

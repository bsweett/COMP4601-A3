<meta name="summary" content="Great Action, but too many mutants!"></head><body><p>I liked X-Men, hated X-2.  In my review for X-2 I say I missed good mutants fighting bad mutants.  Be careful what you wish for.  There are so many mutants, and half of them are just green or blue or tattoed.  I knew Magneto, Mystique, Juggernaut, and Multipleman on the Brotherhood side.  The rest of the mutants I have no clue what their names are.  But theres Spike haired man and tattoed women and  wierd haired mutant.  The action is great but why, why kill off a main character off screen!  The only main character that I felt sorry for was Proffesor X.  The only new villains added should have been Juggernaut and Pyro.  And Juggernaut is awesome.  He brings back memories of the best villain(besides Ian Mckellan)in the X-Men franchise.  Yep, its Toad.  Overall not much of a story but good action sequences.  I was expecting more but when Singer left you knew X-Men wasn't going to be the same.</p></body></html>

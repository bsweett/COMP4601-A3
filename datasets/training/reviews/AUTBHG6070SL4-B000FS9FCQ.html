<meta name="summary" content="Best comic adaptation to date"></head><body><p>-- in two ways. It's a great adaptation of a comic, and an adaptation of a great comic. The two factors combine to create a movie with a much more "mainstream" look than any other comic adaptation I've seen and a much better dramatic flow.<br /><br />First, the story: It's set in the visible future, in an England under some Orwellian regime with a crypto-christian edge. Agents of the regime are above the law, but not above using their power to abuse the rest of the citizenry. Our hero, V, began his the story as a human test animal in some inhuman medical experiment, but came out of it alive - mostly. Now, he's here for revenge against the sadistic crew that ran the test facility, and against the totalitarian regime that supported it. It's hardly a spoiler to say that V gets his revenge.<br /><br />V's mask is about the only real comic-y image in the whole movie. That general sense of reality only strengthens the rest of the movie, including Natalie Portman's (Evie's) imprisonment and the final computer-generated fireworks. There are plenty of surreal elements, though. Except for V's mask and maybe Evie, almost all of the faces are disturbingly asymmetric, as if the twisted faces represented the twisted minds behind them.<br /><br />Maybe the real surprise, if you don't usually read comics, is that V comes from DC, the publisher that created Batman, Superman, and their immediate kin. DC has had the Vertigo line of comics for a long time, intended to hold on to readers who outgrew the super-hero-in-tights genre (that's S-H-I-... never mind). I've enjoyed the Vertigo line, but I admit I haven't read V yet. Based on what I saw in this movie, that's about to change.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

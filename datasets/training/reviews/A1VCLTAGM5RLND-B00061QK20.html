Jet Li plays an amazing part. This film was shot in China. Maggie Cheung never had any martial arts experence an she fought terrfic. Her and Jet Li were dodging and blocking all those arrows both of them can't be human. What was odd was seeing the characters die and come back to life then die again. I gave it four stars cause it should of been rated "R" cause in the being Jet Li naked ass was showing and I wanted to see more blood in this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Looking Backwards with Sentiment"></head><body><p>We see the life of George Bailey. Working as a young clerk in a pharmacy, he tried to correct a mistake by the pharmacist, and is slapped around for this. [Could this happen to the son of a banker?] The pharmacist's son had died in the war (influenza!) and this distracted the pharmacist (drank too much?). Later George enters a dance contest, and some of them take an unintended bath [symbolizing the Crash and Depression]. George's college plans are halted by his father's illness [a symbol for hard times]. Another crisis follows the attempt by Banker Potter to appropriate the Building & Loan Society [which provides loans to working people so they could move from the cold water tenements owned by Potter]. But the Board decides to continue with George Bailey as Executive Secretary. George's younger brother goes to college, marries an heiress, and moves away. There is one scene where Uncle Billy has overdone his celebrating [nepotism is always a problem].<br /><br />Mary gets a call from Sam while George is there. They learn of a stock offer in plastics - "the deal of a lifetime". People in Bedford Falls are out of work since the factory closed down. Later George and Mary are married on a rainy day, but are interrupted by a run on their bank [no FDIC in those days]. George takes charge and saves the business from the schemes of Potter. George's speech explains the economics of banking to the audience: they will be all right if they just stick together. One sunny day shows a family (with a goat!) moving to a new housing tract [as occurred in the 1920s]. This was possible after local farming closed down. This affects the rent profits of Banker Potter, whose tenements are losing renters. [They hadn't yet figured out to fill them up with Welfare clients.]<br /><br />Potter makes a generous offer to buy George. He refuses, and shows he could learn some diplomacy and tact. Trouble occurs when Uncle Billy loses the cash he was supposed to deposit! [Pride goes before a fall.] Potter finds it and keeps it. [Did you expect him to be honest?] This was a management failure on George Bailey's part - sending out a boy on a man's job. George's request for help from Potter is soundly rejected. And so Angel Clarence intervenes. What would happen if George Bailey was never born? [This reminded me of "A Christmas Carol".] At the end the people come up with the cash to meet the bank's needs. And so the story has a happy ending. [Can you believe this?] Bedford Falls doesn't wind up as Pottersville.<br /><br />In real life Banker Potter would have to turn any found money over to the police. Potter has also broken Banking Laws by taking depositor's money without any accounting or receipt. If his servant talked, Potter would spend the rest of his life in jail. Some have noticed the absence of religious persons in this film; what does that say? No mention of other members of the ruling families in this town. I always thought this film had a subtle anti-alcohol message. [The names and settings suggest upstate New York.]</p></body></html>

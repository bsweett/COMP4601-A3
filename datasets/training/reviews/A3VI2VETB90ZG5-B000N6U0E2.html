Picture is steadily crisp throughout. Audio quality is excellent.<br /><br />As far as the movie goes, I was able to watch this while I was wore out from a day at work, and still I was able to keep my eyes pasted to the screen the whole time. Very cool movie.<br /><br />Why Will's character couldn't commute from a lesser expensive place to live, I'll never know, but dragging his kid through skid row really pays off in the end! I'm being a bit critical there. Actually, wwhen all's said and done "The Pursuit of Happyness" really packs quite a punch.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Big Fish is Tim Burton's best movie of his career!"></head><body><p>"Big Fish" is brilliant, it is Tim Burton's best movie of his career. Ewan McGregor plays Young Edward Bloom and Albert Finney (in his Golden-Globe nominated performance) plays his older version of Edward years later. Billy Crudup plays Edward's son, Will. The story is about a father who is dying of cancer and the son who doesn't believe the facts of his life because they seemed too impossible to have really happened. Edward retells his facts of his life to his son and his daughter-in-law, Josephine, played by Marion Cotillard. Through his retellings, he meets a lot of strange, but interesting people. Karl the Giant, played by Matthew McGrory, Jenny, The Witch, played both by Helena Bonham Carter, Burton's real-life girlfriend. There is Norther Winslow, played by Steve Buscemi, Amos Calloway, played by Burton regular, Danny DeVito. Ping and Jing, played by Ada Tai and Arlene Tai. Edward meets the love of her life and his wife, played in his retellings by Alison Lohman and played outside of his retellings by Jessica Lange. There is also the family doctor, Dr. Bennett, played by Robert Guillaume. The movie is brilliant, Tim Burton's best movie ever and his directing is brilliant without compromise. The screenplay by John August, which is based on the novel by Daniel Wallace, the screenwriter of Go, Titan A.E., Charlie's Angels and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. His next screenplay is again with Tim Burton for Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. The music by Danny Elfman is brilliant and the end credits song "Man Of The Hour" by Pearl Jam is brilliant without compromise. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Score and Best Original Song. The movie also got a Golden Globe Best Picture nomination for a Musical or Comedy. The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot is brilliant. The production and costume design by Dennis Gassner and Colleen Atwood is brilliant. The film editing by Chris Lebenzon and Joel Negron is excellent. The casting by Denise Chamian is superb. The visual effects by Sony Pictures Imageworks is brilliant. The performances by Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito and the rest of the cast are amazing, especially from McGregor, Finney, and Crudup. Casting them was a brilliant plan on Tim Burton's part. I loved this movie, because it was different than what Burton usually does. It is a brilliant achievement for Burton and it is a masterpiece. How it was made was intriguing because it seems that it was strange, but once I got used to the idea of the movie, it made me change my mind right away. It was a little bit like Burton's last masterpiece "Ed Wood". I enjoyed that movie but I enjoyed this movie better, because it proves that Burton is a gifted filmmaker who knows what he is doing and he knows how to do it. Go see this movie when you can get a chance because it is a brilliant movie that hit the top of my top 10 movies of 2003, and not because that, because of your opinion of the movie, which could change people's minds like it did with me. Take anybody you want to see this magical film that is different than it seems.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ehhh...pretty good for a sequel and a great build up for 3"></head><body><p>I'd say that this is a film that let's you what's been going on since the end of part 1 and begins to build up to the events we will see in Spiderman 3. Special effects are great. The acting I loved. I felt like I was living the comic book. I'm happy to report, are strong characters and honest feelings. Which is great. I think we can all look forward to the next one which should feature the Hobgoblin and some other villian. Anyway I say that you all must go see this movie. It's very very good!!! I give it 4.5 stars, definately the best film I've seen this year. A must see!!! The prefect summer movie with great acting, great story telling, great characters, great plot, and amazing special effects. So get out and go see it!</p></body></html>

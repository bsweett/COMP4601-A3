<meta name="summary" content="see this for forrest whitaker but little else"></head><body><p>the whole reason to see this bloated movie is forrest whitaker, who manages to contain himself just enough to avoid making the crazed dictator idi amin into a total cartoon.  that is not an easy task, since idi amin is a cartoon, especially in the memory of those of us who lived thru the 70s; does anyone else recollect punch magazines "report from our ugandan correspondent"?.  unfortunately, as is so often the case in stories about third world figures, it has to be told thru the eyes of a white man, who of course gives the proper perspective on the savage.  remember that awful movie about steven biko?  the scottish doctor, who is in actuality the main character, is a buffoon and a bore.  the only reason we want to see the movie is idi amin -- why not just admit to that?</p></body></html>

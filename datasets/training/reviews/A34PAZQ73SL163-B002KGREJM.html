Whitaker's portrayal of Amin was absolutely magnificent. Indeed, I don't see how his roll could have been improved by any other living actor. We find Amin haunting, crazed, diabolical, and charming--traits which completely summarize the man. The seduction of the main character is in keeping with the unique allures of evil and its corruptive power. I suspect that a lot of viewers may feel rather uncomfortable with the naivet&eacute; of Dr. Garrigan in regards to his master and towards Africa on the whole. It's a good thing they do because his character personifies a common western attitude towards the continent. Personally, I meant what I wrote in the title as I could not stop watching the movie once it began. Kevin Macdonald is an outstanding director and I look forward to his work in the years to come.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great movie, but was Travis Bickle supposed to be a hero?"></head><body><p>Watching Scorsese's unfailingly great "Taxi Driver" this weekend, I saw it as a haunting portrayal of a misled psychotic, who goes on a killing spree not to free the 12-year-old hooker from pimps but because he has his own misguided view of everything that's wrong with the world's morality. <p>That he's seen as a hero at the end of the film is a joke, a mistake made by people who think he did what he did to save Iris. Travis wasn't interested, I think, in saving Iris. He was just insane and didn't see Iris as one of the filth of humanity. He saw her as salvageable. He didn't go on the killing spree for her benefit, but her freedom was a lucky byproduct to Travis' madness.<p>This isn't "Death Wish"-type vengeance. Travis is insane, a villain who doesn't understand the depths of his own madness. While dating political volunteer Betsy, he's so unclear on how to go about it that he takes her to a dirty movie, buys her an album she already owns, then stalks her. He writes a manifesto about the evils of society. He's a war veteran, living an isolated life away from his parents. He's unable to sleep. He sees the world as a sick place, where he's the only normal man left. He's not a hero. He's not a tough guy. He's a basket case.<p>Notice how little dialogue he actually has with Iris, played incredibly by Jodie Foster, before deciding to "save" her from Sport. Iris doesn't even want him to do it. Who she is doesn't matter to Travis. What she represents matters more to Travis. He's embarking on a rampage, intending to kill lots of people (including the presidential candidate in a thwarted attempt), yet he only succeeds in killing the pimps.<p>He's not a hero, but society, in one of the film's best twists, makes him a little girl's savior. Betsy, at the end, forgives him without knowing the extent of his madness, and he smiles at her.<p>Then, he keeps driving, thinking, plotting.<p>This is a great, extremely bleak movie. And DeNiro's performance is pitch perfect.</p></body></html>

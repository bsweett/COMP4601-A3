<meta name="summary" content="A broken automaton mends so many hearts"></head><body><p>"Hugo" is a drama genre film where the calamity of several lives intermingles with each other, at the Paris Railway Station of Gare Montparnasse.<br /><br />The narrative follows Hugo Cabret, an orphan boy, who is fending for himself whilst maintaining all the clocks at the train station, and living in the servicing areas.<br /><br />It is a broken automaton that brings many of the film characters together. After the death of his father Hugo believes that returning the automaton back to working order, which has a writing function, will contain a message from his dad, and he works tirelessly to achieve this.<br /><br />The automaton connects more than one broken heart and Hugo's comment that: "machines don't come with spare parts...so as humans we have to assume that there are no spare parts in our world, and that we all have a purpose," is striking as philosophically poignant film dialogue.<br /><br />The viewer is presented with a stupendously crafted story, complemented by wonderful acting, and accompanied by breathtaking film shot selection and vivid colour.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

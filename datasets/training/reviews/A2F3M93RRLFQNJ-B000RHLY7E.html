<meta name="summary" content="Not perfect, not for everyone, but a good movie"></head><body><p>Some movies are for almost everyone; The Devils Rejects is not one of those.  With violence and brutality from end to end, a heap of "adult" language and a healthy portion of nudity, this film is not designed for a wide demographic.  But for those who are fans of violent horror movies (especially along the lines of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre), The Devil's Rejects may be for you.<br /><br />The story follows the homicidal Firefly family, who seem in trouble from the start when the police come to end their long reign of terror.  Otis and his sister Baby escape and eventually reunite with their father, Captain Spaulding.  Being on the lam doesn't really distract from their desire to kill, as they first wreak havoc at an isolated motel before finally finding refuge at a brothel.  Meanwhile, the local sheriff is in pursuit, driven by his own demons.  None of the characters are very pleasant or likeable, so it is hard to really root for anyone; instead, you kind of hope they all meet their maker (you'll have to watch to see who actually does die).<br /><br />Writer/director Rob Zombie obviously has a fondness for this movie genre, and movies in general.  There are plenty of references to other films here, including the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the most obvious of influences), Psycho and even Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.<br /><br />Actually, The Devil's Rejects only seems like a horror movie.  In fact, it is really a comedy.  A grim, twisted dark comedy, but a comedy nonetheless.  And while this film succeeds on a horror level, its humor sometimes falls flat.  You can tell that certain situations are supposed to be funny, but they just aren't.  An eccentric movie critic, a cop who wants to be an Elvis lookalike and an argument over ice cream are just some of the more noticeable attempts at humor, but they don't always deliver.  As a comedy, this is a three-star flick, but Zombie's success on the horror aspects - fascinating even as he repulses - elevates this by a star.</p></body></html>

The original author, Dashiell Hammett was a successful mystery writer and had many of his novels make their way to the silver screen.  One such series was "The Thin Man".  I always liked these movies, as much for their sets as anything.  Here we have a detective, Nick Charles and his wife always involved in something nefarious, but the movies were always light hearted and played with tongue in cheek.  A wink here and a wink there.  Martinis, fancy dress and parties were in play as much as the crime.  This all changed in 1941 when Hammett's "The Maltese Falcon" was remade with Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade.  Directed and written for the screen by John Huston, the film had a dark edge.  Bogart's detective wasn't a saint.  He smokes, drinks, sleeps with his partner's wife, and will stand up to anyone, even the cops.  Most film historians credit "The Maltese Falcon" as the beginning of the film noir style of filmmaking that continues to this day.  The movie has little action, but the script is fast and furious and you have to pay attention to keep up.  Lovely Mary Astor is set to play Sam for a sucker but he sees it coming.  And as much as he would obviously like to bed Brigid (Astor), he would much rather stay alive and out of jail.  We also meet a creepy effete Egyptian played by Peter Lorre and another creepy wannabe gansta' played by Elisha Cook, Jr.  Both will have successful film careers.  This is a first time appearance for hefty Sydney Greenstreet as Kasper Gutman, the primary crook.  The film is great fun to watch, especially Bogart rattling off Huston's dialog. It also shows that Hitchcock isn't the only director to know how to use the McGuffin.  A classic for all time.</p></body></html>

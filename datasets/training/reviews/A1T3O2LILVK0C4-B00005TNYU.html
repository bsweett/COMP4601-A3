<meta name="summary" content=""Goonies Never Say Die!""></head><body><p>In 1985, Steven Spielberg (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXC5">the Indiana Jones films</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9Q">E.T.</a>) served as an executive producer on the Goonies, an adventure film based on a story by Spielberg and directed by Richard Donner (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059Z8J">Superman</a>). Since the film's release, it's become a cult classic of sorts, as well as being a favorite film for nostalgic teens and adults.<br /><br />The story follows a group of outcast kids growing up in Oregon, who call themselves the Goonies, as they spend their last weekend together before their parents are forced to sell their homes to make way for a golf course. Mikey, the youngest and most precocious of the Goonies, finds a pirate's treasure map in his attic and realizes that if the Goonies can find the treasure then their parents won't have to sell their homes. Mikey and his good friends, Chunk, Mouth, and Data begin following the clues that will lead to the treasure and they're eventually joined by Mikey's older brother, Brand and two high school girls, Andy and Stef. But things become complicated when a family of second-rate criminals, the Fratellis, catch Chunk and find out about the treasure. Jake and Francis Fratelli lock Chunk up in a room with their deformed brother, Sloth. Sloth may be fearsome in appearance but his grotesque exterior hides a heart of gold, and he and Chunk become fast friends. Meanwhile the other Goonies make their way through a series of underground tunnels, all the way avoiding booby traps and following the clues. Little do they know that the Fratellis, lead by Mama Fratelli, are in hot pursuit. But can the Goonies find the pirates' treasure and save their homes, and can they outsmart the Fratellis?<br /><br />Like many of Spielberg's own films, The Goonies follows a specific formula. The kids, like those in E.T., swear frequently and use vulgar language, so parents be warned. There's also some risqu&eacute; humor and comic violence, but most of which is simply too funny to be offensive. When inspected closely, the story unravels due to numerous plot holes, continuity errors, and a general lack of realism. But that's all part of the charm of The Goonies.<br />The ensemble cast is terrific especially Sean Astin as Mikey, Jeff Cohen as Chunk, Corey Feldman as Mouth, Ke Huy Quan as Data, Josh Brolin as Brand, Martha Plimpton as Stef, Kerri Green as Andy, John Matuszak as Sloth, Robert Davi as Jake Fratelli, Joe Pantoliano as Francis Fratelli, and Anne Ramsey as Mama Fratelli.<br /><br />The excellent DVD includes outtakes (features the infamous missing octopus scene), The Making of The Goonies vintage featurette, a ridiculously silly 12-minute Cyndi Lauper music video, theatrical trailer, and an audio commentary (with video commentary by Richard Donner, Sean Astin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Ke Huy Quan, Josh Brolin, Martha Plimpton and Kerri Green). This audio/video commentary is perhaps the most entertaining feature I've ever seen on a DVD and alone makes this a worthy purchase.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005J6UR">Gremlins</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006AL1E">Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019GO582">Explorers</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001I562I">Flight of the Navigator</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GUKM">The Monster Squad</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HT3PQK">Home Alone</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005RT3N">The Sandlot</a></p></body></html>

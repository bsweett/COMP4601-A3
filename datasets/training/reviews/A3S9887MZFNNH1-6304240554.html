The F/X were not all that great and the zombies just looked, well...blue. I stayed up late to watch the directors cut on BBC 2 and towards the end I  was getting tired of it. I was going to buy DAWN OF THE DEAD in the shops  but I won't bother now I've seen it and I found it boring. (Sorry to all  the fans out there.) The follow up, DAY OF THE DEAD, was much better and  had dark humour and better F/X and characters.<p>Notice a cameo buy the  actor who plays Rhodes in Day of the dead, appear briefly at the beginning  of this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="28 Days Later: Dark Movie Darker Vision"></head><body><p>28 DAYS LATER is one of the most unsettling post-apocalypse film of this or any other year.  Director Danny Boyle tells an end of humanity tale that pays clear homage to a wide range of similar such films like THE OMEGA MAN, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and THE WORLD, THE FLESH, AND THE DEVIL.  Though the material has been done before, what stamps this film as noteworthy is Boyle's use of lighting and camera.  There is not a single scene that is brightly lit.  Even in those scenes that take place in the full light of day, the audience never gets a clear look at either the background shots or the actors.  And when the camera does pause long enough to show one locale or one face, that shot is blurringly made, almost as if the camera did not want to reveal too much.  Further, much of the dialogue is whispered, so I had to strain to catch the dialogue.  Normally, this low level of sound is annoying, but I had to believe that the dimness of the sound was simply an acoustic variation of a visual deconstruction of both cast and scene.  Claustrophobic shots have been done before, most notably in ALIENS 3 and BELOW, but in 28 DAYS LATER, it is this weird combination of a shutdown in both sight and sound that keeps the audience on edge.  <p>The plot opens with a trio of animal loving activists who seek to free what they consider to be mistreated chimpanzees at the hands of soulless researchers.  Of course, when one of the scientists warns them that these simians carry a fatal virus that causes homicidal mania, you would think that these activists would say 'Whoa' and back off.  They do not and suffer predictable consequences.  The movie then shifts gears in a way that reminds you of THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS when Howard Keel wakes up in a deserted London hospital to find that the world has gone sightlessly mad.  Here, Cilliam Murphy is Jim, who also wakes up in a London hospital to find a very nearly deserted city.  The only inhabitants are raging zombies who seek only to bite the unconverted and a small group of humans who seek the supposed safety of a far distant army base.  Frank (Brendan Gleeson) is a bear of an Irishman who lives only to protect his teenage daughter (Megan Burns).  Naomie Harris is Selena, a lovely but lethal black woman who will kill in a heartbeat anyone who becomes infected. As they travel to seek what is probably the last effective military unit in England, movie goers with long memories will recall a similar scene in NO BLADE OF GRASS in which hapless civilians find temporary sanctuary with soldiers of crumbling discipline. <p>It was difficult for me to center on the morally good uninfected humans since for most of the film, their distinct personalities were deliberately obscured by low sound and dark shadows.  However, the last third reveals the paradoxical truism that both muffled sound and sight merely hinted at: the real monsters were not the howling zombies but rather the unconverted and opportunistic humans who sought to prey on their fellow kind in a way that showcases the horror of the greater damage wrought by them in comparison to the less horrible rendings of the mindless zombies.  By the time the closing credits roll, there is a slight hint that all may yet end on an optimistic note, but the combined savagery of zombie and 'normal' human lingers so strongly that the concluding note of optimism can suggest only that the gap between order and anarchy is a lot closer than we might like to think.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The perfect example"></head><body><p>Of how not to make a sequel in contrast to Aliens (which is a perfect sequel in that it manages to both stand on its own and as a satisfactory continuation of Alien), Alien teeny-tiny 3 establishes itself by undermining its predecessor.  The decision to kill off the survivors of Aliens during the opening credits made a mockery of that film's intense climax which focused on rescuing the little girl.  Not a good move, when you are providing a follow-up to a comercial and critical hit, because then you have to make sure that this movie will be even better.  It also throws out the rules as to the nature of the Aliens.  In the previous movies the facehuggers would be unleashed only when a being is in proximity of the eggs. (It was clearly stated in Aliens that the two rogue facehuggers had been torn from their victims' faces.)  In this movie the facehuggers leave the eggs whenever they feel like it &amp; roam around free.<p>Clearly, the first two movies should be ignored when watching this one.  So, then, how does it stand on its own merits?<p>The answer is:  It doesn't.<p>The pacing is slow, the visuals are murky, the plot is muddled.  A leisurely, unpleasant tale of a lone survivor stranded on a prison planet plays like a bad, pretentious drama until the Alien finally arrives to start killing characters.<p>After watching this movie, the only question is: why didn't they go with their original instincts in Alien 4 and make this incoherent mess into a bad dream?  That is a move which would have tied in nicely to the last line of Aliens (Newt:&quot;Can I dream?&quot; Ripley:&quot;Yes, I think we both can.&quot;)</p></body></html>

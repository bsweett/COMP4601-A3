<meta name="summary" content="Who you calling a dummy, Dummy?"></head><body><p>"Dead Silence" is a mostly jumpless, dreary little turdfiesta of a horror flick by James Whan & Leigh Whannell (the folks who brought us "Saw"), and spends its time tediously tracking Puppets who Kill & the People who Love Them (which would be a great support group).<br /><br />There are worse ways to kill 90 minutes than seeing "Dead Silence". It's not a bad flick. It shows some creepy, ghoulish promise here and there, some flashes---just flashes---of scary brilliance, and the opening 10 minutes pack more full-throated terror into them than a score of 2006's assault of PG-13 "kiddie-friendly" fear flicks ever could.<br /><br />Indeed---from about the second the doomed Lisa Ashen (scream-queen newbie/vet Laura Regan, who looks like her dance card has just been punched one too many times)tosses a sheet over Billy the Dummy to the first few moments our hero Jamie (Ryan Kwanten, literally the man who wasn't there: as an actor, odorless, colorless, tasteless) goes spelunking into the Plot---well, for about 5 minutes I thought this thing was gonna creep & crawl.<br /><br />Alas, no luck: there's some groping about in a root cellar that conjures up giddy memories of The Haunting of Julia (far finer ghostly fare), but after that it's pretty much the standard a) big floaty skull-headed dead woman shows up, flaps & vamps around; b) victim cringes and wheedles c) victim gets tongue torn out and dies; d) Donnie Wahlberg shows up in a dubious moustache & Columbo's raincoat.<br /><br />Rinse, repeat, stretch into a feature film. There's a lot of talky talky talky, which just goes to show that movie producers still don't get it when horror fans say IT'S ALL ABOUT THE SLAUGHTER, STUPID! We don't need backstory. This isn't "Wuthering Heights". Bring on the buckets of blood, already.<br /><br />Anyway, despite a few spooky bits, this is about as good as last year's movie about killer videogames, I forget the name. Indeed, the vibe and the effects are pretty much the same, along with the acting. But from Whannel & Wan, I expected better---and you should too. Why even have 101 Killer Puppets if you're going to do nothing with 'em?<br /><br />Things I observed while watching "Dead Silence":<br /><br />1) Puppets who Kill can get away with murder for a while, but only up to a point. After all, how hard is it to spot a 2-foot-tall assassin with a wooden jaw and a stick up his bungus?<br /><br />2) The Killer Puppets are great at slaughtering entire families with impunity & unleashing jihad on trained police detectives, but not so hot at doing basic Survival 101 moves---like hopping out of burning display cases.<br /><br />3) Donnie Wahlberg is contractually obligated to look seedier & at least 10 years older with every passing film he does.<br /><br />4) Blythe Danner has great horror chops! Blythe is in this flick as the crazy woman who spends time petting a stuffed raven (a great prop!). No kidding. Or maybe it's her daughter Gwyneth Paltrow, I can't tell 'em apart nowadays. They both look like skeletons with a little layer of puffy white dough kneaded across their skullheads.<br /><br />5) If I were to bio-genetically vat-grow a woman of my own, it would turn out looking like Amber Valleta. She can work my puppet-handle any day (lucky, lucky, lucky Bob Gunton).<br /><br />6) Horror movie Scream Queens really have a short shelf life. You disagree? Consider young Laura Regan, who coulda been a contendah, but has instead bounced from one B-movie to another ("They", "Hollowman 2", and now this). She's toast. I couldn't figure out which was the scarier sight, the killer puppet Billy or Regan's slabs of pancake makeup. Yechhh.<br /><br />7) You know what I *do* think "Dead Silence" proves? It proves "Saw" was a fluke. A happy accident.<br /><br />Oh, and the last line of the movie is great: "So who's the Dummy now?"<br /><br />A truer, and more cruelly ironic, movie kiss-off line was never uttered, and the answer is clear to anyone who sits through this stinker:<br /><br />We are.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A VISUAL PHANTASMAGORIA"></head><body><p>In, what has become one of my favorite films, Tim Burton served up an extraordinarily vibrant retelling of the Washington Irving classic, with rich baroque siennas, umbers, and golds jumping out of the mists of a secretive little borough, where a number of bodies begin to show up missing their thinking caps. Enter a constable ( wonderfully portrayed by Johnny Depp ), out of favor with his superiors, given to vapors, and scientific methods that appeal not at all to the puritanical powers that be. With the aid of a local beauty ( winsomely played by Christina Ricci ) of mysterious bent, and a young lad related to one of the headless, our gallant policeman puts aside his fear of large bugs, and searches for a human devil...<br /><br />Bottom line: there are plenty of extras in this particular version, and it's well worth the bread.</p></body></html>

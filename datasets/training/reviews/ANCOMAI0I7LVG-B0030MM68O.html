It is almost guarantied that you are going to experience major backlash.  It seems that that has happened for the surprise juggernaut that was `The Hurt Locker' (seriously, who the heck saw that coming).  The film is not experiencing the same criticisms that so many other `Best Picture' winners have received in the past (just look at the films average rating on this very site).<br /><br />No, `The Hurt Locker' is not perfect.  In fact, I don't think it should have won the Oscar, even considering the Academy's underwhelming lineup (the film, while VERY good, is not better than Tarantino's masterpiece).  That said; this film is deserving of the praise and certainly undeserving of the backlash.<br /><br />The film centers around a bomb diffuser named William James.  James is a wild one.  He needs to feel the adrenaline rush of near death that so many in his company want to avoid.  He is not afraid of danger.  William gets moved into a new squad when their former leader is killed in the line of duty.  William is unlike anything this squad has seen before, and he almost instantly gets under their skin (but not in a good way).  They have just barely over a month together, but in that month the three main characters (Will, Sanborn and Specialist) undergo many emotional changes.<br /><br />Like most have already noted, this is not a war movie.  It reminds me in a way of Sam Mendes' underappreciated `Jarhead' in that it's main focus is on the men serving and not the service they perform.<br /><br />So, I have a few squabbles with the film.  For me, war movies run a very sharp risk of becoming one note and redundant.  `The Hurt Locker' falls into that department at times.  It becomes almost repetitive in the situations these men find themselves.  Yes, there are differences, but they can run themselves together.  It isn't as present a problem as in some other films, but it is there (for me at least).  I also had some issues with the films handling of the `Beckham' (when you see the film you'll know what I mean).  When Will goes out of his way to find the men `responsible' for what he fears has happened it adds depth to his character but it kind of takes you out of the film a bit.  It just appears far too unrealistic for me.  The final scenes also have that feeling (would three soldiers really do that?) but they fare better because of the emotional turmoil and ending revelations they stir up (that clothed shower scene is FLAWLESS).<br /><br />The films actual ending also felt a little `obvious', which I didn't care for.<br /><br />I know it seems like I'm picking on this film a lot, but really, when taken in perspective these issues are small.  The film is gritty and earnest.  Sure, it has moments where the honesty seems stretched a tad thin, but the character never feel anything short of sincere and real.  The film is visually stunning and completely tuned into the adrenaline rush running through Will's body.  The relationship that builds between the three main characters is engaging and it breathes reality.  While I found some moments to feel a tad `preachy' (I wasn't fond of the repartee between Specialist and his counselor) I also appreciated that the film took an obvious step `away' from being a `message' film.  It just let you dwell in that world and decide for yourself what your really think.<br /><br />Let's talk about Jeremy Renner.  What a brilliant performance.  Yes, he made it seem really easy (so it wasn't `wow look at me act' kind of brilliant) but that's what made it so brilliant.  It was honest.  Every smirk or hand gesture or sideways glance was completely lived in and real.  You never once doubted him and his commitment and his needs and his motives.  He wore everything on his sleeve, but not in the `obvious' way in which some actors approach a character.  He felt like you and me and everyone you know.  Anthony Mackie delivers his best performance to date.  I have an issue with him as an actor because he seems to play a variation of the same character in every film (or he at least brings the same facial expressions to every performance) but he actually develops Sanborn in a way that feels sincere.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the slew of cameos from greats like Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes were highly appreciated.<br /><br />In the end this film is well worth your time.  It really works on many levels.  Sure, it isn't perfect (and `near-perfect' is even a stretch really) but it is forgivably flawed thanks to many elements (not the least of which was Kathryn Bigelow's fantastic direction...so much developed tension) that work just right.</p></body></html>

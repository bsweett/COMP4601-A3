<meta name="summary" content="Good Ford"></head><body><p>This is by no means Harrison Ford's very best effort, but it is a good action movie. It isn't "Cellular" or "Don't Say a Word", but it does have a good story, decent acting, and great action. All in all I found it well worth watching and ended up getting a used copy. Fans of action movies like "The Net" and "Inside Job" should enjoy it. I recommend you rent it and see for yourself.<br /><br />The storyline is about a man in the computer security business for a bank group. They are in the process of a merger when his family is taken hostage and he is pressured to give up information on how to access data so the money can be transferred to the kidnappers acount. The action moves at a good pace and a few twists and turns add to the drama. I recommend it, and I think it has good replayability.</p></body></html>

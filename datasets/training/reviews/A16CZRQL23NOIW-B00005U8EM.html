<meta name="summary" content="When the days repeat themselves over and over again!"></head><body><p>"The groundhog day" is a smart and very original urban fable. How would you react in case every day was a simple and monotonous repetition of the previous one?<br /><br />Bill Murray is superb as the anguished and hopeless weather showman and given the options, he experiments with the unexpected reactions of every single person who surround him. Andie Mac Dowell is perfect for the role, because the expected chemistry was an undeniable fact.<br /><br />A clever and sympathetic comedy that will engage you from start to finish.</p></body></html>

The Punisher just didn't interest me as a "hero." So I didn't know anything about his background until I watched this movie. It was actually a really good action movie! The acting was often cheesy and the plot was unbelievable but that's usually the formula of an action movie. Take it for what it is. And I had a great time with this film. It's made me more interested in The Punisher and I'll probably pick up an issue of the comic.</p></body></html>

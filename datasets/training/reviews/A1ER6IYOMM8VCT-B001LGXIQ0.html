Usually they ruin the classic characters or stretch what should be a half hour TV show into a two hour snore fest!<br /><br />'Get Smart' the movie is one of the best transitions to the big screen I've seen in a long time. Steve Carell knows better than to try and be Don Adams, so he does his own take on the character and pulls it off beautifully. It's not "fall on the floor" funny all the time, but the action and humor are mixed well and it's better than a lot of the Bonds films!</p></body></html>

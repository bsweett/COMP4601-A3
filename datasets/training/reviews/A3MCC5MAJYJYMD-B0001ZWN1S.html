<meta name="summary" content="An all-time classic."></head><body><p>'The Godfather' is one of the few films that's got it all.  It has great acting, characters, editing, storytelling, dialogue, actors, scenery, and ending.  Watch it and you will find yourself going back and watching it again and again.  You will discover new things about the movie you didn't notice before and enjoy like never before.  A true classic and one of the best films ever made.  This DVD includes commentary by Francis Ford Coopola, the director of the movie; some of it is interesting, but most of it boring.</p></body></html>

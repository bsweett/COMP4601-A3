<meta name="summary" content="An often forgotten side of the story"></head><body><p>"Letters from Iwo Jima" is a film that provides a Japanese perspective regarding the WWII island battle, and works in partnership with "Flags of Our Fathers". It is rare that a viewer has an opportunity to consider multiple narratives regarding a war. Yet Director Clint Eastwood's excellent foresight allows the viewer to appreciate that the Japanese soldier had their own duty, and suffered immense casualties too.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

<meta name="summary" content="A HUGE eye-opener of a movie!"></head><body><p>This film shows a world of unbelievable violence and greed. Africa's beauty and wildlife are usually romanticized, but this film shows a much different picture.<br />If I hadn't already seen documentaries on this subject, I might not have believed it could be this bad. Not one for conventional jewelry myself, still I certainly look at precious stones much differently.<br /><br />It is riddled with violent warring factions, street shootings, espionage, betrayals and the helplessness of the innocents caught up in it. At the center of it all, a large pink diamond in-the-rough; the cost for it to adorn someone's neck being far too high. Actors DiCaprio and Hounson do a superb job with their roles.<br /><br />Hounson's character says he had heard his people being told they were better off when the white's ruled. I think they were better off before whites ever came, having brought capitalism in the extreme. Africa by right, belongs to Africans.<br /><br />The speech made by a politician at the end summed it up well. I wish more movies like this were also made about the fur, animal souvenir and live-animal trades as well (such as 'Gorillas in the Mist').<br /><br />A must-see, but for Adults Only.</p></body></html>

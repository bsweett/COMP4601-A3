<meta name="summary" content="One of the best movies I've seen!"></head><body><p>I doubt there's any movie you will see this year that will be as good as Sin City. it's visually stunning, sexy, full of great lines, unforgettable characters and suspenseful action. The cast is great too. Micky Rourke shows why he should be in more movies as Marv. Marv is a kickass character  who's out for revenge against the people who killed his love Goldie. Micky Rourke is just simply awesome as him and should be even nominated for best supporting actor.<br /><br />  The rest of cast are really good too but not as good. Clive Owen (King Arthur, Closer) who I didn't even know existed until last year is also extremely cool as Dwight. He goes after  the dangerous Benicio Del Toro and winds up starting a war between hookers and cops. So he has to set to make things right. The heroes played by Rourke, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis all have  soft spots for women. Willis "who's also the best he's been in awhile" has to protect the sexy Jessica Alba from the Yellow Bastard.<br /><br />  The Yellow Bastard is a sleazy pedifile who tried to kill  her when she was little but was stopped by Willis. The cops are crooked though and put Willis in prison because he wouldn't take blame for raping the girl. The Yellow Bastard's father is the mayor and owns the cops so he can get them to do anything he wants. When Willis gets out of prison he finds that he put Alba's life in danger by finding her and leading the Yellow Bastard straight to her. So he has to protect her one more time.<br /><br />  This movie is just great and director Robert Rodriguez's crowning achievement. Since he gets some directing help from Quintin Tarantino and Frank Miller I don't know if he'll get the best director nomination he deserves. Anyway he does here what every director who adapts a book should do, get some insight from the writer to make sure it's done right. This movie isn't just right though...it's done perfect. After seeing this I think  Rodriguez is the only person that could bring Stephen King's Dark Tower books to life as well.</p></body></html>

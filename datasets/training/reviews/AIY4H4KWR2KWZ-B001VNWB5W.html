As a young man who was active in the comics world during the release of The Watchmen, I can attest to the astounding and ground-breaking impact it had on storytelling, art, and vision. It was the Star Wars of comics - laying waste to the uninspired, underperforming and often flat world that was comic books at the time. When it ended its 1-year run - The Watchmen had changed an entire industry - it was THAT amazing.<br /><br />But this visually rich film fails at capturing, what is at it's core, a mystery. Who Is killing The Watchmen? And why?<br /><br />The film is so non-linear that it's very near impossible for the average viewer to take in and process. It's 1953, now it's 1985, now it's 1971, now it's 1944, now it's 1979, now it's... you get the point. Too muddied, too disconnected, too many plotlines to properly thread together a meaningful story.<br /><br />As a fan, I 'got' what was being offered, and if we were all comic geeks, I think we would be unanimous at this stupendous achievement.<br /><br />Sadly, and I think this is lost amongst fellow nerds, MOST of the audience are not, and will not, become hardcore fans just to see a film. That Director Snyder sought out the approval of the fans is what unfortunately sinks this film into the mess that the average viewer has to sort out for themselves.<br /><br />What should have been the focal point, as in the original storyline, was Rorschach. It should've been made clear that it's from his perspective all the surrounding stories swirl. He is us - the audience. We're being taken along a complex  investigation about the deaths of his former comrades. THAT should've been the foundation upon which this story should've been told. But what we get is a mishmash of introductions, flashbacks, intersecting plotlines, dropped plotlines, missed & missing connections - all carried along with spectacular visuals that sadly lose their meaning since it's not placed within the context of  a story that we can readily absorb.<br /><br />Solution: You start at the past. An introduction of characters; a brief synopsis of who and what they are; what their relations are to one another; what happened to them throughout the years. Boom - 25 minutes of film - the stage is set for the rest of the story. But what happens? Well... what happened.<br /><br />Watching the Watchmen is like eating cotton candy - visually and texturally appealing, but ultimately leaving you empty inside.</p></body></html>

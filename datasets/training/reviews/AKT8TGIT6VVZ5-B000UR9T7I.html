<meta name="summary" content="Admirable Spider-Man Sequel, But...."></head><body><p>Of the three Spider-Man films, "Spider-Man 3" has the most intriguing storylines, resolving some of the plot threads left dangling from the previous films with regards to the relationships between Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry Osborne (James Franco). Indeed, when the film revolves around their friendships, it conjurs up some of the most magical movements in the three films I have seen for these three distinctively intriguing characters. But of course "Spider-Man 3" is more than a fast-paced action adventure thriller involving three friends; this time it offers three - perhaps four - villains who become worthy opponents of Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire). But it's three villains too many, since none of the villains truly rise to the epic proportions of the original Goblin (Willem Dafoe) or Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) in the two previous Spider-Man films.</p></body></html>

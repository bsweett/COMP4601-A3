<meta name="summary" content="Terrific comic book movie!"></head><body><p>Former FBI agent Frank Castle ( Thomas Jane) has just retired from the FBI as he celebrates his retirement with his entire family. However, Howard Saint ( John Travolta) has a diabolical plan on revenge for Castle killing his son, he sents out assassins to take out Castle's family leaving only Frank to survive. He then in turn becomes vengeful, he becomes a Skull T-shirt wearing vigalantee named "The Punisher" as he must take a bite out of crime and get even with Saint.<br /><br />This is a highly underrated but well done adaptation of Marvel Comic's character, it is a slight improvement over Dolph Lundgren's 1989 version but this time with the skull logo shirt and faithful to the Punisher's origin. X-Men's Rebecca Romijin-Stamos co-stars as the lovely restraunt owner who befriends the title hero, it does have some brutality and dark humor to help with the movie.<br /><br />The DVD has some good featurettes, a music video, a trailer to the recently released video game of "Punisher", Audio Commentary, Deleted Scenes and crisp Sound & picture quality.<br /><br />This movie deserves another look, it's a very much grown up Marvel comic that is quite different from any of the other recent Marvel Movies alongside the Blade trilogy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Finally, The TRUTH About Texas"></head><body><p>I heartily recommend that everyone who even remotely considers relocating to Texas view this documentary before doing so, to be aware of the sorts of folks and situations with which you will routinely have to deal (in addition to all the pollution and absence of a state income tax) -- it will make you completely rethink your plans. If you don't want your life plagued by dull-witted screaming teens, country hick redneck crackers and, of course, chainsaw-weilding homicidal maniacs, then you will want to avoid the Lone Star State completely, and prevent yourself and your family from falling victim to the mayhem here. Oh sure, parts of this documentary were amusing, but the sheer horror overwhelms all of that, every day here. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Texas -- stay alive, stay undismembered, stay sane and, above all, stay safe. You definitely do not want to move here.</p></body></html>

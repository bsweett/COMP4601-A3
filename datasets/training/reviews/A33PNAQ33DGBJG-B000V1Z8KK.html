The acting is good with the exception of Danny Glover.(I don't know what is up with him lately!) There is plenty of action but the story line just drops off halfway through.  The ending isn't what I would have liked but I guess that is hollywood. The language and violence makes this a NON-family movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="5 stars for the fun... superb Bluray edition"></head><body><p>I do not intend to get into details about if the movie is good or bad. It is a movie based on a cartoon that was most of the times cheesier than the two existing live action movies about giant transforming robots from another planet. Need I say more? I'll focus then on the Bluray edition and its contents as there are already plenty of reviews discussing the quality of the film.<br /><br />Disc one includes the movie with an audio commentary by director Michael Bay and the writers. The movie looks and sounds incredible in its Bluray edition, the level of detail (1080p) on the scenery, the characters, the robots (while transforming for example) and the sounds during the battles make perfect reference material for HD home theater display, a 5.1 DTS-HD master audio track is included, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital are also presented. There is however, an exclusive edition which includes the IMAX scenes in shifting aspect ratio, this is not the version Amazon is selling in case that's the version you are after.<br /><br />Disc two is loaded with plenty of extra material in full HD:<br />* The Human Factor (Exacting Revenge of the Fallen) - Includes documentaries covering the whole process from Development and design to post-production and release of the film, you can watch them separately or as a whole.<br />* A Day with Bay: Tokyo - If you followed the release of the film in theaters you may remember the world premiere took place in Tokyo; this documentary includes all the details on the premiere, from Bay's impressions on 'Terminator Salvation', to the press conferences and the like. While in HD most of the time there are some night shots that do not look that well.<br />* 25 Years of Transformers - This is a documentary on the history of the Transformers franchise.<br />* Deleted/Alternate Scenes - Only three are included and they are actually extended scenes that you can easily tell why they were removed ("Sam and Alice meet", "Witwickys in Paris"  and "Leo refuses to go to Egypt")<br />* Linkin Park's "New Divide" Music Video<br />*The Matrix of Marketing - Includes trailers, TV spots and image galleries of posters and merchandise.<br /><br />While I prefer the first movie over this one, 'Revenge of the fallen" does not disappoint in its Bluray edition. Another Michael Bay popcorn film filled with explosions, great cars and giant transforming robots. If you, like me, get this movie just for the fun and do not expect Criterion Collection material, you are in for a treat.<br /><br />One last note for those collectors interested in slipcovers, Amazon's edition comes in a pretty cool Optimus Prime one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still Confused"></head><body><p>There has to something in Japanese movies that I don't get.  Thinking of The Ring and The Grudge of two movies that I don't understand at all.<br /><br />When I read about the movie, it sounded promising:  young American woman residing in Japan with her boyfriend. She is temporarily assigned to be a caretaker for a woman with severe sleeping conditions.  The house is plagued by the presence of murderous ghosts, the result of a curse. The curse is born from someone dying in a powerful rage.  Seemed interesting enough but I was wrong.  It's almost as if there should have been a prequel to this movie.  I don't even know if I'd recommend it or not... I'm still confused.</p></body></html>

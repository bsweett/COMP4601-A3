Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, is tired of Halloween.  He kidnaps Santa, thinking he can do a better job and ends up creating the halloweeniest Christmas ever.  Some sensitive kids and adults may be disturbed by the imagery and the fun Burton pokes at the holiday.  Definitely for more mature children only.</p></body></html>

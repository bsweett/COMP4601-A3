The movie is a plodding meditation on coming-of-age for a boy in Sweden and the Swedish vibe soaks the entire film, right down to its color palate. This film is as much about Sweden as it is about vampires.<br /><br />Claudia in Interview with the Vampire brought about some uncomfortable questions about what happens when a child is turned into a bloodsucking beast. Let the Right One In answered that question: you get a 400-year-old bloodsucking child.<br /><br />Eli has her own ghoul, a scarred, plodding man who is not very good at bloodletting. His inept attempts force Eli to take increasingly drastic measures, until the whole town is on to her. But not before she befriends the little blonde moppet named Oskar (Kare Hedebrant).<br />Thing is, Oskar's kind of a freak.  Obsessed with stabbing the bullies who harass him, mouth breathing when he swims (seriously, he seems like he will nearly drown every time he gets in the water), and torn between his attractive but busy mother Yvonne (Karin Bergquist) and his fun but alcoholic father Erik (Henrik Dahl), Oskar doesn't really fit in anywhere.  Until he meets Eli (Lina Leandersson), and suddenly it's clear that they were meant for each other.<br /><br />Let the Right One In makes a point of keeping their relationship asexual. Eli's appearance varies from sickly to vibrant, depending on how much blood she can drink, which isn't very much. She resorts to ambushing the drunken, sad sack residents of the town, who take quite a long time to rally a defense.<br /><br />Let the Right On In uses special effects in surprisingly effective ways, with one exception: when cats, who can sense vampires, go on the offensive, they look like bad CGI. But there are other scenes that are pitch perfect and perfectly convey a vampire child in a stark white world.<br /><br />There's a distinct lack of police presence in this movie. The police are only heard as sirens, never in person. There's no sheriff to speak of. Part of why Eli gets away with as many murders as she does is because there's a plot-induced blindness by law enforcement and medical services.<br /><br />And yet Let the Right One In is an undeniably creepy vampire movie. It's in part related to the no holds barred conflict between bully and bullied, who increasingly up the stakes until...well, until a vampire has to get involved.  And that never ends well.<br /><br />American audiences are likely to find Let the Right One In dull and plodding, with occasional moments of brilliance.  I prefer to see it as a distinctly Swedish take on the bloody business of puberty.</p></body></html>

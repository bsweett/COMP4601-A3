When I grew up a bit, like say, in middle school, I knew exactly what I wanted. I wanted a remake of the film that was so cheesy and yet so lovable. Sooo more than a decade later, I finally got my wish-or not.<br /><br />The remake of Clash is appallingly bad, and not in a cheesy way. It is just bad. Everything about it is worthless. The characters are pointless and have no redeaming qualities, the Gods are completely underutalized. The plot is non-existant and really doesn't make any sense. Andromeda may as well have been written out of the script since her appearance in the film had NO purpose. The CGI is OK but man do I wish for the old Medusa. The list goes on and on. The acting is the only saving grace here. And I'm pretty much talking about Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson. They commanded the screen in their small, pointless roles. Sam Worthington does a good job, but nobody CARES about his character. He comes off as arrogant and unworthy of anything.<br /><br />There is no soul to this film. It is just bits of action scenes sewn together for entertainment purposes. I was so frustrated and aggravated after the ending because after literally years of hoping and waiting, the final outcome is just plain garbage. Perhaps my expectations were too high but maybe if the creators spent more time on the actual plot and less on trying to make this film 3D, then just maybe it would have turned out decent. Or maybe not.</p></body></html>

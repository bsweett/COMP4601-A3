<meta name="summary" content="Send this crap back to Asia!!"></head><body><p>I swear, it all started with The Ring, which was based on the Asian horror film Ringu. And now we have The Grudge based on another Asian film, Ju-On: The Grudge. Since The Ring's popularity, Hollywood figures they can widen their horror movie audience by putting out a bunch of PG-13 "scary" movies so more people can go see them and make some bucks doing it, but what Hollywood doesn't really realize is that they are really losing members of their real target audience that made horror films so popular in America. It's really a sad time for the genre right now.<br /><br />The Grudge is another movie to jump on the band wagon of watered down horror/thriller movies (Darkness, White Noise, Boogeyman) that really offers nothing but cheap thrills to people who are easily frightened by simple scare tactics and shock value. And I am not one of those people. What ever happened to the horror movie rule that "if you can't scare them, gross them out with blood and gore"? I was perfectly happy with horror films that lacked in the scare department but made up for it in the blood and guts department.<br /><br />But don't go thinking that the only reason I didn't like this movie was that it didn't have enough violence. I'm just not a person who is easily startled by jumpy scenes, especially in movies like The Grudge. Some of my favorite horror films have little to no gore (Halloween, The Shining, The Blair Witch Project). I like the type of scary movie that gets inside my head and scares me psychologically, not movie's with whimpy ghost popping out of a closet.<br /><br />Other than that, The Grudge offers not too great of acting, almost no plot, and is not scary at all. Enough said here.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hanks saves the film"></head><body><p>There some good things in Cast Away take Tom Hank's performance for example but that it's it. The rest of the cast isn't in the film long enough for one to get a vibe of how they would have acted. For over an hour there's no dialouge jsut Hanks standing around. If you're a Hanks fanatic then this is the movie for you, otherwise stay away.</p></body></html>

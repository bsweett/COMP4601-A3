If you are like many, this is often the case during the holidays.  This classic film is a gentle balm for the holiday malaise.  It is corney and sappy, its true.  But the message is nonetheless true and will tug at your heart like few others.  Its a must have/must see movie.  The grandady of all "feel good" movies you will not want to miss.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Van Helsing- Not bad, if you care for Special Effects"></head><body><p>Van Helsing is one of those movies which you just don't take seriously what so ever.  Hugh Jackman was a fine actor to play the lead and Kate Beckinsale was eye candy, her accent pretty much resembled that of Count Dracula from Sesame Street. Director Stephen Sommers abandons a plot and just amazes with visual and special effects.  Sommers's scored big with the "Mummy" blockbusters which were enjoyable though the first film was a great deal better.  The dialogue is more than laughable.  The plot I won't even bother to try and explain cause it's that bad.  Pretty much Jackson plays Van Helsiing  a lethal hunter, who kills monsters for a living, soon Beckingsale's character must help him to try and stop Dracula.  Make sense?  Probably not, but it's still enjoyable.  As I said earlier the visual aspect of this film is stunning, the action is nearly non-stop too.<br />  Van Helsing is rated PG-13 for Non-Stop Creature Action Violence, Frightening Images and for Sensuality.  The violence is pervasive and includes the use of an assortment of Helsing's many sweet weapons such as his cross bow, pistols, etc.  There are also many creepy and frightening montsters (what a shock to find out)  so this film.  The sensuality is nothing explicit, just some sexual innuendo.  Overall a big-budget summer flick (approximately $150 million) which has done well at the box-office.  Worth seeing in theatres, but you probably could wait and get it on DVD or video. May be a tad scary for adolescent audiences.</p></body></html>

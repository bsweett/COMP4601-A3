We both thought Sean Penn was good in the role of Harvey Milk, but the Mrs. Opined "I'm not sure he deserved the Oscar... now we have to see The Wrestler. (To see the acclaimed performance of Mickey Roarke)"<br /><br />I'm not so certain, although I'll reserve personal judgment until seeing The Wrestler as well.  About thirty minutes before the ending of Milk I'm watching Sean Penn in a scene wearing a T-Shirt, meeting Denis O'Hare as California State Senator John Briggs.  It occurred to me "I can hardly believe this is the same actor from Mystic River.  Or Bad Boys.  Or Dead Man Walking."  You get the idea.  With the same body and face Penn was a completely different person.  The body language and voice even made him appear markedly different. I've seen reviews saying Penn becomes unrecognizable in this role as Harvey Milk.  I was always aware that I was watching Sean Penn - but I saw no flaws in this performance.<br /><br />Penn is ably supported by the almost all-male cast including Josh Brolin as fellow San Francisco Supervisor Dan White, James Franco as lover Scott Smith, Victor Garber as Mayor Moscone and Emile Hirsch as cruiser turned Gay activist Cleve Jones.  Alison Pill has the only significant female role as Anne Kronenberg, a political operative who is brought in after Milk fails a couple of campaigns because she is more macho than Milk's previous inner circle.  She obtains Harvey's first newspaper endorsement - a significant step.<br /><br />I was a child during the time this film was set, and the thought occurred to me "why should there be a politician whose entire political agenda is based on a non-majority sexual preference?"  Put another way - if a heterosexual person were running for office, would it be pertinent if their entire platform were based on their heterosexuality and their only agenda were the rights of heterosexuals?  The answer, of course, is that no serious political attempts have ever been made to remove the civil rights of heterosexuals.  If politicians are trying to take away your jobs, and even threatening people who support you, you have to fight back.<br /><br />(A side note: I think about the recent avalanche of laws trying to prevent same-sex marriage, and I wonder how far universal civil rights have advanced.  I recently voted against a measure in my home state that passed - defining marriage as only possible between one man and one woman.)<br /><br />We have come, perhaps, a few steps forward.  A few years ago I heard local radio talk shows paint "Brokeback Mountain" as the Gay Cowboy movie.  This year I don't recall a single discussion about the Gay Politician movie.</p></body></html>

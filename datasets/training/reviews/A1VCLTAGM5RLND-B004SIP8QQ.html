There are a few scenes that seem like they could've been cut out in the editing room without a problem, or at least shortened. Nothing of any real significance appears to be going on, and whether or not these moments get better in any repeat viewing, they can come off as extremely pointless. The only thing exciting about this movie is when the woman pulled the other woman's eye out.</p></body></html>

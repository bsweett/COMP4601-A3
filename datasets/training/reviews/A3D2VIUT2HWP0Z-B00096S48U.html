<meta name="summary" content="Obvious  Remake Material"></head><body><p>This is probably the most obvious film to remake  when the release  date is July 6, 2006, a date chosen before the film was done.<br /><br />Overall the film is very Good, when seen on its own  and in no  way comparing it to the original.Mia Farrow, Michael Gambon and David Thewlis are excellent in their  respective roles; Mia being suitably diabolical, and Gambon exceedingly excessive.<br /><br />The extras are fun too, and very enlightening, especially the Black Friday event. The promise of other Omen remakes is nice, especially if they pick more intense actors.<br /><br />Sadly, if comparing this  film to the 1976 original is done, well, the original is a gem. What should also have been done is a Re-Release of the original with Punched up audio, cleaned up Video, and enhanced everything.<br /><br />The original Omen Films are still master works. A pity that the casting was not on the same par.<br /><br />However, I did enjoy the film, Missed on the release  date, but happily purchased with a suitably Cool Iron Maiden  special edition.</p></body></html>

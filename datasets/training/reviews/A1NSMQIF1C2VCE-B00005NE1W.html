<meta name="summary" content="The thinking man's comic book movie"></head><body><p>I suspect my grade will go up in time -- this movie, like &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; requires a bit of thinking about after it's over. <p>And, also like &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; it's hard to talk about this movie due to the risk of saying too much. <p>I will say this, as it occurs in the first 15 seconds of the movie, before even the credits begin: The film opens with a discussion of comics in America today, with text talking about the number of issues sold, how many hours a comic collector will read comics in their lifetime, and so on. <p>&quot;Unbreakable&quot; is a movie about superheroes. Sort of. <p>This isn't a gritty &quot;real life superheroes&quot; in the vein of &quot;The Watchmen.&quot; For all its dark sets and whispered dialogue, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; has more in common with &quot;gosh wow&quot; comics than it does grim 'n gritty stuff. That's only natural, since the movie is about hope and the possibility that there are, among us ... well, to say more would be to give it away, although I suspect most people can guess. <p>As with &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; there is a twist at the end, but it's not the key to the whole movie, unlike in the previous film. <p>And, as with &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; the movie is more than a clever concept and good writing, although it has both. Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Robin Wright Penn and that little boy -- I was almost expecting Haley Joel Osment in this -- all do outstanding work, making what could be flat characters into real people. For all of the comic book tropes at work here -- the alliterative name of the protagonist, the uniform he wears that gives him a classic silhouette, and so on -- the film never feels like a gag or a gimmick, and it's the quality work of the actors that elevates it away from schticky territory. <p>This is absolutely the smartest, most mature comic book movie ever, and a film for even those who find comic book movies abhorent to begin with. <p>Thoughtful, thought-provoking and a film well worth seeing.</p></body></html>

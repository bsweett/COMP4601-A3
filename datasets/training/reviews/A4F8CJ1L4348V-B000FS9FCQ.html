<meta name="summary" content="Remember, remember the 5th of November...What an excellent movie with a definate statement"></head><body><p>I am very overwhelmed and speechless after watching this movie. It takes every civil rights movement and rolls it all into one. This movie takes a very serious look at the way violence is portrayed in modern society and how it is reported to society as well. There are a few things that do stick out in my mind. One of them is "We should not be afraid of government, they should be afraid of us" and look at the last election what we did as a nation to change what is effecting us. Another thing that sticks out in my mind is history and the definition of "terrorists". Are the "terrorists" coming from an outside source? Or are they coming from within our own country? Are the "terrorists' acts" planned from our own country from people that we should trust? Or maybe we shouldn't have trusted them in the first place. If you look at history of the world from the witch hunts to Nazi Germany to modern day government, it is all "controlled and guided" by religious zealots trying to "save society" or "save the children". We should wake up as a "world" and save ourselves from them. I am with V in this one; everyone should have the ability to live in peace for whom and what they are. Not be controlled by government guided by religious zealots in how you should be or who you ought to be. Until then, there will be no peace. I highly recommend this movie to everyone!!!</p></body></html>

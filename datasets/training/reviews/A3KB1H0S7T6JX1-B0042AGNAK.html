<meta name="summary" content="Constantine meets the Prophecy trilogy"></head><body><p>I have to say that I am not familiar with any Ghost Rider comics, games or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot compare the character to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" Johnny Blaze prior to the film I have to say that the movie was pretty good!<br />Ghost Rider brings to the screen the story of a young man who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for curing his father's cancer.<br />There are slight hints of the X-Files, and strong/obvious elements of the Ninth Gate (starring Johnny Depp), Constantine (starring Keanu Reeves), and the Prophecy trilogy (starring Christopher Walkin), so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category.<br />Nicolas Cage and most of the rest of the cast carry out their performances well (Blackheart and Mephistopheles could have been played much better).<br />The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the music, and the special effects, are all good.<br />Ghost Rider is a movie guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.<br />In short, I would definitely line up to watch a sequel!</p></body></html>

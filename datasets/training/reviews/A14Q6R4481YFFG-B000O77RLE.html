American students of the War in the Pacific respect the Japanese soldier's martial spirit in general and the Japanese on Iwo Jima in particular.  What's objectionable is the portrayal of U.S. soldiers casually shooting prisoners of war.  Did such a thing happen in the War in the Pacific?  I'm sure it did, but there's no record of it happening during the battle of Iwo Jima, and it's a distortion to include that scene, which is hypothetical in this case and is given a prominent place in the movie's plot.*  In a small way it's like De Palma's "Redacted": based on some truth but leaving out so much context that it becomes a de facto lie.  Shame on you Clint!  Shame!<br /><br />*  Do people judge FDR prominently on his treatment of Japanese-Americans during the War?</p></body></html>

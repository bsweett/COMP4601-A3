The reoccurring McDonald's "cheeseburger" character was hilarious. If a wrestling fan you will notice 3 wrestlers in it-Stone Cold Steve Austin, Goldberg, and Kevin Nash. The football game was action packed. Besides being funny it was 100% entertaining and well worth the admission. The movie itself was about 2 hours long and not being a big fan of MTV itself they did do a great job of making this movie.</p></body></html>

Collin is a pathetic and screwed up big baby who is grown jealous of his father's affection towards Sullivan. He carries out the job of finishing Sullivan and his family succeeding in killing his wife, played by Leigh, and younger child. Both Michael and Michael Jr set out on a trip of high stake bank robberies to avenge the death of their other family members, attempting to pay off Al Capone's lieutenant, played by Tucci, to end their protection of the Rooney's. While they are on their crime spree, the cold-hearted killer creates a special bond with his son, and slowly redeems himself. In the meantime, Capone's lieutenant had already hired a spooky hitman named Maguire, played menacingly by Law, to puruse the Sullivans and finish them both. Sullivan realizes that he must do all he can so his son will never follow in his footsteps.<br /><br />Perdition is an awesome film, with incredible cinematography, a heart-warming storyline, and great performances by the entire cast.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A-</p></body></html>

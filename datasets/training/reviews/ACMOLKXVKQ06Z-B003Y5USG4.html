<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, but a little repetitive."></head><body><p>This movie was a blast.  It was fun to watch and it was very entertaining.  If you can, check it out on DVD, the digital sound mix is definately something you can use to show off your sound system.  The only problem I  had with this movie was the fact that the plot seemed to keep repeating:  Go out and get tornado, almost get killed, survive.  That is mostly the  movie, and there is a side love story.  Here is an interesting gripe, when  they are 20 feet away running from the tornado, their hair isn't even  blowing!  I guess CG tornados can't do that.  <p>Still, great special  effects, good fun, and good entertainment.  Reccomended for action buffs.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A somewhat worthy sequel."></head><body><p>This film, though not as good as the original, is a marvel of special effects.  The plot is less coherent (and, ultimately, less believable) and moves a bit more slowly.  What's missing here is some originality.  We've seen most of this in the first Blade movie.<p>Rental only.  Buy if you're a fan of the series.</p></body></html>

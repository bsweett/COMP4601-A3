If you like South Park and Trey Parker and Matt Stones sense of humor you will wet your pants on this one. The North Korean dictator is one of my personal favorites, "Hans Brixxxxx (U.N. Weapons inspector Hans Blix). "You're breaking my balls Hans, your breaking my balls." There are so many funny things in this movie that I can't even go into it. It is a total take off on Jerry Bruckhiemer movies in it story and how the puppets talk and act. It is also a take off on the extreme stupidity on both the right and the left wing in American politics.<br /><br />AMERICA "F" Yeah!</p></body></html>

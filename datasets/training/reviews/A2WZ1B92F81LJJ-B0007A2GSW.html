<meta name="summary" content="Incredible by name, incredible by nature"></head><body><p>Finding Nemo was a dud, so it is great to report that whatever rot had set at Pixar in has surely stopped: Whereas Nemo was an impressive visual spectacle but a poor, mawkishly sentimental (ie, typical Disney) piece of cinema, the Incredibles manages not only to set new standards in digital animation (there's a clear message to the Revenge of the Sith producers, and it's "beat this, George Lucas!"), but do it in the context of a clever, knowing, arch and stylish script and cleverly worked screenplay.<br /><br />It's true: the old Pixar of Monsters, Inc. is back, and better than ever.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></body></html>

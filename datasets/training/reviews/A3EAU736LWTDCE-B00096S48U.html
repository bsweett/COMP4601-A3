<meta name="summary" content="Too much like the original, I didn't see any improvement outside the fx"></head><body><p>This is a review from a die hard horror movie fan:<br /><br />Sorry, but first I must put the smack down on the "bible nut" that bashing this movie: to the annoying guy quoting the bible, please feel free to research what I am about to tell you: Just last year they discovered a fragment of the oldest surviving copy of the new testament.  It was all wrote in ancient Greek, in the third century. Basically, after scholars deciphered "the oldest documents", they determined the mark of the beast is closer to "616". So much for your 6 o'clock, 6 day, 6 month garbage! Am I saying they are right? No. I really don't care either way, but it proves no one really has a clue what really happened and people make up their own suppositious rules to live by. As far as I am concern today isn't even 6-6-6. it is 6-6-2006.<br />6-6-6 happened thousands of years ago, did the world end at 6 o'clock that day? Phfft!<br /><br />  Again, sorry for the delay, now on to my review. I think it is funny how movie goers are bashing these waves of new horror movie remakes that keep hitting theaters. Everyone cries that the original was better or they say "I wish it was more like the original". Well here you go folks, you want the same old rehash movie that you can rent right at your local video store? Then go right ahead and pay the extra price to go to the theater and see the same movie. THIS IS WHY PEOPLE REMAKE OLD HORROR MOVIES DIFFERENT FROM THE ORGINAL FORMAT! I also don't get the reviewer who says this is "not as good as the original" To me this is the original. Same deaths, same story, no surprises. Why not improve on it? I was hoping for something totally new with more action, more modernization, more deaths, more fx, and maybe even a little more of Damien's life: growing up and taking over the world. They could have done way more with this movie. I know other horror fans are going to hate me for saying this, but I must first promise you, I am as big of a horror movie fan as they come, If I wasn't, I would not have ran out and seen this movie on 6-6-06. With that being said, I always though the original Omen was very boring. Unfortunately, this movie captures that aspect of the original all too well! At least it does have more action in it than the da vinci code!<br /><br />Verdict: I must agree with the guy who said "Unnecessary remake" If you really want to see this new Omen movie, then just save yourself  several dollars and go rent it for a couple bucks at your local video store. It is literally the same movie. I will give it credit for the improved deaths scenes. Which was the only highlights of the movie, but improved as they were, in the end, they were the same deaths as the original. More gore please! Its not a bad movie, I didn't dislike it. I just felt like I rented the original Omen movie again and paid way too much to see it on a big screen.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Tragedy in Three Acts..."></head><body><p>2007's "Atonement" is a beautifully acted and directed movie, a richly textured period piece, and a tragedy in three parts that defies easy description without giving away the movie's punchline.<br /><br />At the center of the story is female writer Briony Talis.  When the story opens on a hot summer's day in 1935 at an English estate, Briony is a highly imaginative 13-year old girl trying to stage a play with her reluctant cousins.  The genesis of tragedy is Briony's observation of her older sister Cecilia's (Keira Knightley) relationship with Robbie (James McAvoy), son of the estate housekeeper and a bright and decent lad whose college education Briony's father has funded.  Cecilia and Robbie are on the verge of a passionate romance, but through Briony's eyes, Robbie's actions take on a more sinister connotation.  When one of Briony's cousins is sexually assaulted, Briony pins the crime on Robbie, who is sent to prison.<br /><br />The movie jumps ahead to 1940.  Robbie, released from prison to join the British Army, is one of many soldiers awaiting evacuation from Dunkirk as the German Army closes in.  In flashback, we learn that Robbie and Cecilia, a nurse working in London, rekindled their romance before Robbie shipped out for France.  Briony, now 18 years old, has begun to appreciate the dimensions of the tragedy she unleashed by her false testimony in 1935.  She has passed up college to become a trainee nurse in a hospital dealing with battlefield wounded.  We see her reach out to her sister and Robbie in an attempt to make amends.<br /><br />The final narrative leap is to a studio interview with an aging Briony(Vanessa Redgrave), who has just finished her 21st and last novel.  The novel is about the tragedy of 1935, an effort to atone for what her mistake cost Cecilia and Robbie.  In this interview, the final plot twist is delivered, and the viewer can now make sense of a movie told from multiple points of view.<br /><br />Sets and costumes are perfectly chosen for each time and place in the movie.  The evocation of Dunkirk is heartbreakingly real.  Director Joe Wright delivers a spectacularly long tracking shot that portrays the full horror and chaos of the evacuation beach.  Knightley, McAvoy, and the three women who play Briony at different ages do a very good to excellent job imparting emotional punch to an austere storyline.  An example is Briony's moving attempt to comfort a dying French soldier in hospital.  The ending is likely unexpected for those who have not read the novel, and may be more or less satisfying depending on the value the viewer places on the literary device that conveys the final plot twist.<br /><br />This movie is very highly recommended as a well-done and thoughtful viewing experience.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What is HAPPENING to M. Night Shyamalan?"></head><body><p>It seems as though Night's movies are getting worse and worse. Almost 10 years ago, he soared into popularity with the highly original and engaging "The Sixth Sense". He followed up with "Unbreakable" which wasn't quite as good, but was still very engaging. "Signs", in my opinion, was on equal terms with "The Sixth Sense" and is one of my favorite Shyamalan films.<br /><br />Then came "The Village" and "The Lady In the Water". Both films were OK and had an original premise, but they both fell flat when it came to true suspense and the infamous "twist" ending.<br /><br />Well, here comes "The Happening" which seems to be completely devoid of a point. There is no "twist" ending and no plot resolution. Things happen and then they stop HAPPENING.<br /><br />>>> POSSIBLE SPOILER &lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />OK, OK. I get the "message" of the film. Man is ruining the earth, so now the earth is fighting back. So, now what?<br /><br />The story pulls you in and you really feel for the characters which makes you anticipate some sort of climax or resolution, but instead, we get a blank screen and the credits roll.<br /><br />Come on, Night. We know you can do it. Thrill us again. Stop trying to deliver your "messages" and just entertain us. That's what we really like.</p></body></html>

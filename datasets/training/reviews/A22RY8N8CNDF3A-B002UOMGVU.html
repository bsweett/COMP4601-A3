<meta name="summary" content="Violent Pre-Runner of Sopranos Series"></head><body><p>The movie was directed by Martin Scorsese and released in 1990.  I was not really interested in seeing it until a friend mentioned "it is a classic - a must see, even if it if violent and graphic - it is based on a true story."<br /><br />After seeing it I realized this was the story the  popular TV Series, The Sopranos,  is based on. Mundane tasks of everyday life with family and friends are framed next to the violence of mob life.  The stark contrasting brings the mob in focus. It follows the life of Henry Hill; the movie is narrated by him throughout and later by both him and his wife Karen.<br /><br />The first line in the movie is "As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster."  This is from a young pre-teen named Henry Hill in 1955.  He lived in a small apartment in Brooklyn with an abusive father,  an overwhelmed mother and four siblings.  He did not care about being President, he worshiped gangsters and wanted to be one with every fiber of his being.  He saw shady transactions at a cab company across from his building.  He knew blackmail, kickback's, gambling was going on - this was his escape from boredom.  He wanted excitement and idolized the mob.  Somehow he got a part-time job parking their Cadillacs and waiting on them hand and foot.  He was paid well and made more money than the kids in his school, plus had "respect."<br /><br />Once the movie started, it engrossed as well as shocked.  The brutality and killing was "part of the job" .  Even though the mobsters acted tough and cool - you could feel the stress of the job was with them.  Scenes showing how the secrets were kept, how limits on communication, avoiding "witnesses", and the irrational "blowups" over nothing ended innocent people's lives.  It relieved their stress for a short period of time, but caused more stress hiding bodies.  Mobsters liked the excitement of what they did, but watched constantly over their shoulders for a snitch, as well as paid high fees for "protection."  The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were accurate.  Lorraine Brocco, who played Karen Hill was great.  (She looked so familiar - then I realized she also plays the psychiatrist on the TV Series of the Soparanos.)<br /><br />Martin Scorsese did a brilliant job with the directing and camera work.  The rock and roll music from the 60's was a good "place setter of time."  The script moved well and the characters were well developed, believable and real.  It was a great mob movie.  Ray Liotta was fantastic as well as Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro - all a "cut above."  I understand why this film was recommended as a "must see" -if you can stand the violence.</p></body></html>

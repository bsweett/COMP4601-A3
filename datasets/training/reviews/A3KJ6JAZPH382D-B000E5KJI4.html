What a mess of an adaptation. If you even have a passing fancy for Greek Historical Fiction, then "Troy" will annoy you senseless. Like when Achilles and his cousin are sparring among the ruins? I mean, if it was the present, wouldn't they NOT be in ruins? And what of the fate of Agamemnon (well played by the always dependable Brian Cox)? Did his wife just move up the date for his death and nobody told us?<br /><br />The three-star rating is for the fact that, as epics go, "Troy" is really stunning to watch. Big Battles! Buff Bodies! Beautiful Ladies! Intrigue! Horses and Ships at Sea! Peter freaking O'Toole! Just forget anything you ever learned about Greek History or the writings of Homer and you'll get a good PopCorn adventure. But if you can't? Don't have any heavy objects that might shatter your TV screen near your lounge chair.</p></body></html>

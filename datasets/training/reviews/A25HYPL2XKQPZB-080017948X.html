<meta name="summary" content="This movie is definitely a comedy classic!"></head><body><p>Until last weekend, I'd never seen Groundhog Day. I'd also seen hardly any of it on television. But of course I knew what it was about. The film has its own place in pop culture and is always included in a discussion of great comedy films. Groundhog Day, featuring Bill Murray in his prime, is about Phil Connors, a cocky arrogant weatherman, that travels to watch the yearly ritual of the groundhog, his shadow, and the coming of spring. Phil brings along his photographer, Larry (Chris Elliot), and his producer Rita (Andie McDowell). They are both subject to Phil's selfish actions throughout the day.<br /><br />Then, Phil wakes up to the same music as the day before. He soon realizes everything is the same. He is reliving Groundhog Day again. By now, even if you've never seen the movie, you know what the plot is. Yet, you are in for a great surprise. Phil relives Groundhog Day hundreds of times, and each time, Rita, Larry and the townspeople are living the day as if it is their first.<br /><br />Phil goes through several stages, from cynical amusement at the prospects of living the day over, to using his knowledge to take advantage of strangers, to total despair at the prospects of stuck in the endless loop of time. Eventually, Phil changes in a heartwarming way and the movie ends happily.<br /><br />This kind of movie would never be made today. Its pace is slow and deliberate, yet full of laughs. It isn't raunchy and doesn't try to get away with stuff. The movie treats the viewers with respect. It never explains why Phil keeps reliving the days, nor does it ever explain why he stops. Just like everything else in life, it just happens. I'm sorry it took me so long to watch this pleasant movie from 1993. If you haven't seen it yet, you should definitely check out this classic.</p></body></html>

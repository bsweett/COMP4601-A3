<meta name="summary" content="Compelling, But Not a Mystery or a Thriller"></head><body><p>The jacket on this disc is misleading. The movie is characterized as a thriller and a mystery. It's neither. It's more of a Missouri Ozarks odyssey, with almost a documentary feel to it, vaguely reminiscent of John Sayles' "Matewan." However, this film isn't about miners. It' about ordinary mountain people and their struggle to survive.<br /><br />It reveals the seldom-explored lives of these people. However, far from this rural town being a benign and gently humorous Mayberry, this film reveals life in such mountain settings as being often difficult, decimated, and brutalized by the role that drug-dealing has come to play among the inhabitants as a way of sustaining themselves.<br /><br />The central character in this story is a 17-year-old girl who circulates among the distanced people of this enclave, looking for her father whom she suspects has been driven into hiding as a result of his "cookin'" - meaning his cooking of crystal meth. Meth seems to have taken the place of the more amusing moonshine that used to characterize mountain entrepreneurship. There's an urgency to the girl's search. Unless her father shows up for his court hearing, his bond will be forfeit and the girl and her family will lose their house, the one thing that secures them in place.<br /><br />This film is beautifully photographed. I especially appreciated seeing the strong, unvarnished women's faces that it features. These faces, allowed to be present without the concealments and erasures of botox or blush, tell the story of the hardships these women have suffered. They are intrinsically beautiful faces.<br /><br />The main failing of this film is that its plot doesn't make much sense. Perhaps something got lost in translation from the acclaimed book to the screen. The violence in the movie seems to be dragged in out of left field. It's as if the producers feared that a mere representation of a girl's quest for her father would be too boring. So they threw in some sudden, unmotivated mob violence against her. Why would her neighbors turn on her that way? Is it that they feared she would tell the town sheriff about their own complicity in the drug trade? Is it that they feared she would somehow betray the fierce loyalties that bind the people in this area? Maybe, but these hardly seem like adequate explanations for their threatening descent on her, like the villagers' descent on Dr. Frankenstein's castle with torches.<br /><br />Then the girl's reaction to the vicissitudes of her odyssey is a constant blank impassivity. Jennifer Lawrence registers neither fear nor fondness. So her character's courage ends up looking more like simple indifference. I don't know if this is due to bad acting or bad directing.<br /><br />But these flaws end up being relatively minor detractions from what is overall a beautiful, absorbing drama about the persistence of a rural refuge that few outsiders would otherwise get to visit.<br /><br />One final reason to get this DVD is the thread of traditional bluegrass music that runs through it, making up its score. It's a rare treat to hear raw, honest voices intoning these time-honored tunes in our age of generally over-produced, over-amplified video extravaganzas. Here music literally is brought back to its roots as a homespun, intimate activity - back to where the singer and the song are one. The entire expanded score for the film is available as a separate CD/record.</p></body></html>

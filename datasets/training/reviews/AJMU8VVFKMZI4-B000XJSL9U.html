<meta name="summary" content="A solid action thriller"></head><body><p>Despite the fact that Bruce Willis is the same character is ALL his film-we return to the main one that made him infamous in the late 80's and the same formula still works.  When we first meet John having an argument with his daughter, I'm instantly reminded of the similuarity of the scene of that of The Last Boy Scout.  How McClaine is still just some cop and not the mayor or some high ranking politician with his record of heroics is amazing within itself or heck, let's send him to the middle east and let him win the war for us.  The man should be able to win the thing within 24 hours.  My point is NOTHING is believable in this and at least 3 of the films in this franchise-BUT damn if you can turn away from it.  There is something about Bruce that speaks to the hero in all of us.  We want to be that bad MF who has a sarcastic quip for every and all situations. McClaine is like Cher and cockroaches, you can't get rid of him and he damn sure won't go away.  Overall, this series still has what it takes to thrill you.  Come on movie number 5.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Thrilling Horrific Adventure of the Legendary Monster Hunter"></head><body><p>In the Far side of Romania, lies the country of Transvilvania- home of many nightmarish creatures including the evil and undestroyable Count Dracula and the only man who can can kill this blood sucker is Van Helsing. Inspired by Universal's classic horror films "Dracula" "Frankenstein" and "the Wolf Man" comes this thrilling action packed adventure from Stephen Sommers, the director of "the Mummy" "the Mummy Returns" Starring Hugh Jackman as the notiorous monster hunter who dedicates his life to vanquishing evil creatures, as he battles Count Dracula, the Wolf Man and he encounters the Frankenstein Monster with a Beautiful Woman with a family lasting mission to destroy Dracula. It's a spectular great visual effects filled thrill ride, an amazing landmark Universal film that pays homage to the classic horror films. If you like monsters, adventure and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, then see "Van Helsing" it's monsterous entertaining experience that I hope has a sequel.

<meta name="summary" content="Sidney Lumet in Top Form"></head><body><p>Director Sidney Lumet's BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD was one of the very best pictures of 2007, and it's a shame that it was ignored during the Academy Awards.  Certainly the script, direction and performances were much better than in many of the films that were honored.<br /><br />A melodrama in the best sense of the word, the New York-based film, written by Kelly Masterson, tells of two brothers (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) who are desperate for money.  They decide to solve their problem by holding up a suburban mom-and-pop jewelry store, an easy target.  The problem is that the store owners are the boys' parents (Albert Finney, Rosemary Harris) and, during the robbery, actually carried out by Hawke's buddy, something goes terribly wrong.<br /><br />Now, the brothers have to not only cover their tracks because Finney is determined to find the guilty party, but they must also deal with a blackmailer.<br /><br />The climax is both shocking and violent, as everything for the brothers seems to spin out of control.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei co-stars as Hoffman's wife, who just happens to be having an affair with Hawke, and Amy Ryan plays Ethan's former spouse.<br /><br />?

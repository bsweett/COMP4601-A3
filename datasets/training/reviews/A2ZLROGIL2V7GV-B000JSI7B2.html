<meta name="summary" content="One of the Darkest Films of the Year"></head><body><p>&quot;From Hell&quot; is not for people with weak stomachs.  This is a dark and disturbing thriller that will keep you up at night.  The action may not be fast paced, but it's one hell of a story!<p>The movie is about the notorious &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;.  A mysterious person has been roaming around, slaughtering women left and right, leaving each murder more gruesome and puzzling than the last.  A detective who has &quot;visions&quot; and the smarts to solve murder cases is the only one who stands a chance to find out just who is Jack the Ripper, and why the murders are taking place.  What he finds are twists, surprises, and an unspeakable conspiracy.<p>The film was brilliantly directed and the cinematography was outstanding.  The acting was also very good and believable.  There are a few parts in the movie which seem slow and kind of drags the movie out.  Some of the violence in the movie is hard to watch, but is very neccisary.  This isn't a movie you're going to want to see over and over again, due to it being so disturbing and graphic.<p>Please, if you are a parent, DO NOT bring you children to this movie.  I cannot tell you how many parents I saw at the movie with 6 and 7 year olds.<p>All in all, this was a very good movie.  It's not one I'm going to watch over and over again, but it is worth seeing.  You may not like it if you're expecting a horror movie that will make you jump out of your seat.  It certianly scares you with its disturbing elements.  See the movie for yourself and draw your own conclusions.  I thought this was a great movie with brilliant directing, acting, and most of all, story.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great 3rd Spiderman movie"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed watching the third installment of the Spiderman series. The plot is great, the animation is outstanding, and the acting is great. Peter Parker's life gets turned around when a black symbiote attaches itself to his suit. The suit enhances his powers, but makes his heart turn dark. Will Spiderman be able to defeat the powers of the black suit?</p></body></html>

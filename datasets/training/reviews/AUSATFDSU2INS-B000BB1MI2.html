<meta name="summary" content="A very sweet treat"></head><body><p>The new version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory represents exactly what the audience should expect from a Tim Burton film: exuberant sets that challenge all possible camera angles and show a kitsch quality; weird supporting characters that prove to be a critic and piercing look at the American suburban world, Danny Elfman's exquisite music and as a cherry top, the presence of Johnny Depp, in his fifth collaboration with Burton.<br /><br />The original 1971 film had a clear anchor in the pop visual look of the times; Burton's film evokes some 60's pictures in his art direction, photography and in the sweet innocence quality that all movies lack in the present. Without a doubt, the production design, art direction, costumes and sets are worthy of an Oscar; as well as Elfman's score, who added music to the verses written by Ronald Dahl, the author of the book.<br /><br />Likewise, we should speak of Johnny Depp's performance for his extraordinary creation of Wonka. Compared to Gene Wilder's character in the 71' film, Depp's Wonka is more repressed, more peculiar and far more apt to this version, because it looks real and nostalgia-free.<br /><br />The casting was terrific, from my point of view, and no one dissapointed in that department. A special mention to the man who played the Oompa Loompas...he was just superb and hilarious, in a freaky way, but terrific!!<br /><br />In conclusion, I think Burton's version is superior, its ending more wholesome and its sensibility definitely more contemporary. This movie has updated all the elements that became somewhat obsolete in the 1971 film. All these aspects have enriched the story, and this makes Charlie and the Chocolate Factory a very sweet treat.</p></body></html>

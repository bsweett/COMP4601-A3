<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Films of 2009; A Remarkable Movie"></head><body><p>The Hurt Locker opens with a quote; "the rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug." Kathryn Bigelow's film is probably the most acclaimed film of the year, ending up on many critics' top 10 lists, with Roger Ebert going so far as to call it the 2nd best film of the decade. When a film receives such monumental acclaim, it's hard to imagine it living up to expectations and you will find those who have already called The Hurt Locker overrated and disappointing...I was skeptical, I'll admit, but The Hurt Locker delivers.<br /><br />Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are part of a bomb-defusing squad in Baghdad. In the beautifully filmed, poetic opening scene their sergeant (Guy Pearce) is killed when a bomb goes off. SSgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) is brought in to replace him. Sanborn and Eldridge notice immediately that James is more reckless than their previous technician and he has no reservations about it. He's not cocky, but he knows he's good at his job...Even when he's putting both himself and his team in more danger than necessary.<br /><br />Some familiar faces pop up for brief appearances, actors like David Morse and Ralph Fiennes but the film is owned by Renner and Mackie. The acting in this film has been raved about, but this acclaim has been muffled with more focus being cast on the film as a whole and its female director. This is unfair because both Renner and Mackie carry the film and they both give terrific performances. The acting here is subtle; these are not powerhouse, fishing for an Oscar-type performances. It's the subtlety of the performances, the tapping into real people rather than characters that make these performances great. Renner, especially, nails his role as the adrenaline junkie. Here's an actor that once made Jeffrey Dahmer a sympathetic character and here he really brings you into the mind of James, showing how he thrives on his job rather than just presenting this to you. Both actors breathe so much life into their characters, they rarely let you in on the fact that they are acting...Their performances seem real.<br /><br />In the film industry, the most celebrated directors are almost unanimously male. Kathryn Bigelow has now made her presence known amongst her male colleagues (notably her ex-husband James Cameron, who has also been celebrating the critical and financial success of a "small" film he made), showing that a woman can handle challenging, powerful material that is typically left to male directors. If she were to win the Best Director Academy Award that she will inevitably be nominated for, she will definitely deserve it.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker works as an action/suspense film and a character study/human drama simultaneously. It's remarkable that Bigelow has managed to balance it out so well, making a film that will appeal to different people for different reasons. Aside from getting into the mind of its main character, it has some intense scenes of heart-racing action; made even more effective by the very real setting...The film was shot in Jordan, at times only three miles from the Iraqi border. Cinematographer Barry Ackroyd deserves his share of credit, using frenetic, yet coherent filming techniques that adds to the realism without making the film hard to follow. Not being a Hollywood production, The Hurt Locker benefits even further by not being afraid to enter darker places that would have been ignored and/or glossed-over to conform to Hollywood standards.<br /><br />I've never been big on war movies, but The Hurt Locker completely exceeded my expectations. It's a great film, easily one of the best of 2009 and it's hard to imagine another film about the Iraq war topping this in scope, entertainment value, or relevance. This film is not just a flash in the pan either and I think that it will continue to gather more acclaim as the years pass. It's a true masterpiece; poetic, exciting, and memorable.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

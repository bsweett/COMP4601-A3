<meta name="summary" content="They Live on This Floor, Mother, Daughter, and ... : Supernatural Horror with Less Scare and More Intelligence"></head><body><p>Hollywood version of 'Dark Water' tries to do something we all long for in great horror films, but seldom get in reality. That is, realistic character and realistic scare, and the film directed by Walter Salles almost succeeds in getting both of them.<br /><br />Probably you should not watch Salles' `Dark Water' as horror whatever your fefinition of horror might be. It does not show many deaths, and its mystery is almost non-existent. The story is not complicated. A mother and a daughter move into an apartment in Roosevelt Island, New York City, but in this small room a series of strange things start to happen, for example, a leak from the ceiling, or sound of someone walking, coming from the room above, where no one should be living.<br /><br />But the modernized ghost story has in its center the characters drawn by novelist/screenwriter Rafael Yglesias (`Fearless'), whose interest does not seem to lie in telling a traditional horror story. Instead, Jennifer Connelly plays the loving mother Dahlia, who is in the middle of custody battle over the daughter Cecillia. Not being able to afford an expensive place, she rents an old apartment room to live with her lovely daughter, but what she is really afraid of is not the dark corridor or dirty basement of the building, but that one day she might lose her daughter. In that case the smooth-talking landlord (John C. Reilly) or grim old super (Pete Postlethwaite) do not help. Or, perhaps, Tim Roth's lawyer who uses his car as office.<br /><br />You see, `Dark Water' is a curious mixture of classic-type horror and classic-type drama. If Dahlia is driven to nervous breakdown, it might be because of the acrimonious fight against husband (Dougray Scott), or because of her own fear that her daughter might be going away from her, or maybe Dahlia's own past that is suggested in the opening. The emotion of some scenes is, some say, more suitable for much more `serious' dramas.<br /><br />Though they are fairly interesting, these aspects of the script about divorce court only weaken the supernatural part of the film, for which it was originally made. We surely see the dropping water from the ceiling, and the black stain that grows bigger and bigger everyday, but that only makes us think that they need a good plumber and less irresponsible super. Yes, the production designs of the building are superb, always creepy enough, but when we are greatly impressed with these spooky images, we forget anything about the not-so-rare story about the husband who left, or the custody fight.<br /><br />It was only three years ago that I watched the original 'Dark Water' (or 'Honogurai Mizuno Soko Kara') in Kyoto's old Toho-theatre, and as far as I can remember, the film didn't show much about the mother's past because it does not have to. Well-crafted as it is, this original film was not a big hit in Japan in spite of its director Hideo Nakata and the original writer Koji Suzuki, the same team who gave us the chilling 'Ringu.' I still don't know why it failed to attract many people, but whatever it is, Hollywood decided on adding materials to the Japanese version. It is laudable that they gave it an intelligent, psychological elements, but if you want a horror to be really scary, and supernatural story more fascinating, intelligence and psychology (and lawyer and custody) may not be necessarily the best choice to do so.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best films of the year"></head><body><p>What happened to this movie when it first came out? I remember seeing the theatrical trailer some time ago, but after that I totally forgot that this movie existed until it came out on DVD recently, and I'm sure that's the case with most people, which is a shame because this is one of the better movies that 2005 has produced.<br /><br />Adrien Brody leads an all star cast in this gripping and intense story of a Gulf War veteran named Jack Starks who has been found guilty for reason of insanity for killing a police officer. He is then committed to an asylum for his insanity. There, his doctor, Dr. Becker (played by Kris Kristoffersen) performs an odd and extreme form of treatment by putting Jack in a straight-jacket and making him lay for hours inside a body drawer that morticians use to store bodies in. There he travels into a kind of time paradox where unlocks secrets to his not too distant future as he has reason to believe he will die in just four days, which leaves the viewer in question, is this a self-fulfilling prophecy about to happen, or is Jack Starks truly an insane and troubled person?<br /><br />What I really liked about The Jacket was that not only at first, it was a twisted, claustrophobic mind boggling psychological thriller that was reminiscent of Jacob's Ladder in a way, but by the end of the film there was a powerful and dramatic message behind it that was very moving. Almost like two movies in one. And it was just very well shot and the overall direction was great. And it was superbly acted by some very fine actors. I just could not think of any reason why this film would deserve anything less than 5 out 5.</p></body></html>

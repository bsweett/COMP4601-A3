<meta name="summary" content="Third time is not as charming....but still good!"></head><body><p>Spidey, everyone's favorite webslinger, has returned to the summer box office....reloaded with twice the amount of villains, 3 times the amount of action and triple the romance.  Now the question on everyone's mind....is it as good as the other two?<br /><br />Well, not really.  Its not a bad film by any means but the third go around lost a little of the charm.  Tobey Maquire remains endearing as lovable nerd, Peter Parker, who is a diligent student by day and crime fighter every available minute of the day.  Kirsten Dunst is also back as Mary Jane, Peter's girlfriend who, in this film, is having an emotional meltdown.  And, James DeFranco, returns as well becoming the New Goblin, reviving his rivalry and hatred for his former friend, Peter Parker.  JK Simmons also gives us laughs as stressed out and Spidey hatin' Daily Bugle editor, J Jonah Jameson.<br /><br />New additions include Topher Grace, who does a decent job as Eddie Brock, who eventually becomes the evil Venom.  Thomas Hayden Church is the Sandman, a onetime crook who is linked to the death of Peter's Uncle Ben.  And then there is the beautiful Gwen Stacey, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who throws a little tension into the Peter/Mary Jane romance.<br /><br />So with all the amped-up action sequences, the extra stars and big budget you'd expect that Spidey 3 would trounce its predecessors.  The problem is this----sometimes you can simple OVERDO IT!  This is the case with Spiderman 3.  Things are so jam packed with extra villains and all the action sequences (my favorite being a scene at the beginning with Gwen Stacey and a runaway crane) that the story seems to just fall into the background.  Things are rushed this time to get us to Spidey vs Venom/Sandman and some things (such as the alien lifeforce that attaches itself to its host) go completely unexplained.<br /><br />With a record breaking weekend haul of 148 million domestically, it is certain we are hungry for a new Spiderman movie.  Let's hope, however, that our next viewing of the worlds favorite webslinger returns to a simpler, more story driven movie with enough action to keep us interested but not enough to bog the film down.  Worth watching---a good popcorn movie but not as good as the best in the series, Spiderman 2 or the original.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DANCING IN THE DARK"></head><body><p>Natalie Portman's riveting Oscar-winning performance dominates this dark, cheerless film.<br />Skillful direction by Darren Aronofsky deftly draws the viewer into the idyllic world of ballet.  The viewer asks what is real and what isn't.  Is BLACK SWAN entertaining?  Marginally.  Is BLACK SWAN well made?  Definitely.  Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey, Mila Kunis and Winona Ryder are excellent but it is Portman's descent into madness that remains etched in your mind.  BLACK SWAN is assuredly a film that makes an impression.</p></body></html>

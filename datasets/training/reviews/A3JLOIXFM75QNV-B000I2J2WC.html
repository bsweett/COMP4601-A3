<meta name="summary" content="ugh Tom Hanks..."></head><body><p>Anybody who has read the book knows that Tom Hanks is NOT in no way Robert Langdon. No. Way. When I first heard that I thought it was a joke, but unfortunetly, it was the awful truth. And he did ruin the movie for me. That and the fact that they butchered the beautiful novel. It was barely recognizable. What's even worse is that they are making 'Angels and Demons' and still keeping Tom Hanks. Another disaster waiting to happen.</p></body></html>

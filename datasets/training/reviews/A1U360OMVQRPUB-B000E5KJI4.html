<meta name="summary" content="Mythical Warriors"></head><body><p>The blind poet Homer wrote down the lives of Achilles and Hector, the two bravest warriors to come out of the Trojan War.  They were men who knew honor and wanted a lot out of life.  Achilles wanted ever-lasting fame.  Hector wanted his family, his people, and his country kept safe.  Ultimately, these two men came to deathblows.  Hector's brother, Paris, kidnapped Helen, the wife of Menelaus, from the Greeks.  This provided all the excuse Agamemnon needed to crush the Trojans and add them to his list of conquered people.  The Greeks sailed to Troy to reclaim their lost queen, but the war lasted a long time and proved more costly than anyone would have believed.  But Achilles and Hector were at the eye of that storm.<br /><br />Brad Pitt stars as Achilles and does a good job in the physical and emotional sense of the character.  Eric Bana plays Hector, and comes across as a noble champion.  The film was directed by Wolfgang Petersen, a director noted for his attention to detail and willingness to get the scene no matter what it takes.<br /><br />TROY is a throwback to old Hollywood style filmmaking.  With a cast of thousands.  Of course, most of them are really computer animation, so the numbers are actually in the hundreds.  But the movie is just BIG.  The HD DVD version features beautiful imagery and Lossless sound that really makes you glad you bought the surround sound system.  The story is so big that even when it finishes two hours and forty-plus minutes later, you scarcely notice the time.  Something is always going on.  Some character is always in trouble (or dying or grieving).<br /><br />I was familiar with the story from high school as well as college, but the two characters never touched me so much before.  Maybe it's because I'm older and realize now how much was truly at stake and how different things might have been.  But I choose to believe it's because the story was present so well, visually as well as emotionally.  The suspense was great, because you could see how fate would intervene again and again until there was no choice but for Hector and Achilles to fight, one man against the other.  TROY is a great addition to the home library whether you're a fan of one of the actors or big period movies.  Get it or rent it and you're in for a treat.</p></body></html>

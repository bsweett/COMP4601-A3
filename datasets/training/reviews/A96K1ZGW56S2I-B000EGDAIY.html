<meta name="summary" content="Frightening or Funny: You Decide."></head><body><p>In THE GRUDGE a nurse fails to show up for work at the home of an American family living in Tokyo and an American exchange nurse-student, Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is asked to drop by as her replacement.  Karen finds the old lady to be mute and sleeps throughout the day.  Strange events occur in the house and Karen discovers that the building seems to be tainted by a curse caused by a grudge.  Strange events begin to happen and people start dying.  No matter how many victims are killed, The Grudge just won't stop.  It seems that an evil emotion that takes the former of frightening-looking, blue Asian children and a sound that sounds like someone with a chicken bone stuck in their throat just can't be appeased.<br /><br />I watched THE GRUDGE with a group of friends late one night.  Many of them were scared throughout the movie and couldn't go to sleep that night.  Some of my friends didn't find the movie frightening at all, but several days later found that they were having nightmares and couldn't go to sleep.  Japanese horror movies seem to have a psychological effect on some people that lets them experience terror when they would least expect it (I know people who were affected by THE RING the same way).<br /><br />However, I found THE GRUDGE to be one of the silliest, funniest, and most convoluted films that I have seen in a long time.  I busted up laughing during the movie several times and was given strange stares by those around me.  I just didn't find the movie very scary.  Also, unlike some of my friends I didn't wake up days later having nightmares. Instead, I would find myself laughing at inopportune moments as I remembered some of the scenes from the movie.  Most people I have talked to have thought my reactions to the film rather strange, but I have a friend who is a director and though he didn't find the movie to be funny, he did say "it's garbage".<br /><br />There are many who will find the movie quite frightening.  Personally, I recommend it to see the lovely Sarah Michelle Gellar.  She might not be a great actress, but she is attractive.  The film also has Bill Pullman in a supporting role and Pullman is usually a joy to watch on the big screen, too.  Overall, though I didn't find THE GRUDGE very scary at all, I know that many do and it is seeing at least once for Gellar and Pullman's performances.</p></body></html>

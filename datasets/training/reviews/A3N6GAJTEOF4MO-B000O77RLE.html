I personally loved that film and was delighted to see that Eastwood had done what rarely is, and told the other side to that story from the perspective of the Japanese army. Iwo Jima takes a very similar approach to telling the story of the main soldiers by zooming back and forth from past to present, explaining how the soldiers got to where they where and what they've left at home. I can certainly see the difference between this and 'Flags' and I would certainly rate this as the better, yet would not be willing to shut down 'Flags' in a hurry.<br /><br />Iwo Jima gives what seems to be an open view on the side of the Japanese and touches upon the Honour principle as to how the soldiers fought without cowardice or retreated with dishonour. This is a strong film when touching upon the Honour principle that the Japanese live by. It even touches upon the fact that some soldiers were actually killed if they displayed any sort of cowardly behaviour and would sooner kill themselves than surrender. It's an emotional experience to watch these Japanese soldiers who don't really want to fight, but are forced into it for fear of being executed as traitors if they refuse.<br /><br />The island of Iwo Jima is the last part preventing the USA from taking Japanese mainland. Because of this the Japanese are desperate that American soldiers don't take the island, so the Japanese Imperial Army employ General Kuribayashi to develop a strategy that would defeat the American army. However, the general does not approve of the rigid traditional approach by some of his sub-ordinates. He also begins to resent the resistance from the sub-ordinates to follow his new commands and new ideas which he hopes would help defend the Island. In the lower ranks is a young soldier Saigo who, in his home life is a small town baker now forced with the struggle to overcome the inevitability of his death along with his fellow soldiers.<br /><br />Eastwood has a way of making films that is unmatched by any other film maker today. He's shockingly brilliant and although I'm not crazy over his acting, his directing is truly superb. He manages to blend large scale CGI with blood and guts and the truly emotional story together perfectly to give the viewer one hell of a movie going experience. If you're not a fan of foreign films then this may not be your kind of film due to it being entirely in Japanese. The acting of Ken Watanabe and Kazunari Ninomiya is just second to none, and will hopefully introduce the greatness that foreign films even if directed by Americans, can be truly superb without the recognition an English speaking film would gain.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this film to anyone put off by the fact that it's Japanese speaking. There are subtitles to aid you in following the story, but it's still something to experience even if you have trouble following the subtitles.</p></body></html>

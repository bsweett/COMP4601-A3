<meta name="summary" content="Bits of Fantasy, but More of a Drama"></head><body><p>Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is the middle of five kids and the only boy.  His family is poor and lives on a farm in the country.  In fact, they're so poor he has to wear his older sister's shoes on the first day of fifth grade.<br /><br />It's also that first day of school when he meets Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb).  She's his new neighbor.  When she beats Jesse at races during recess, he's less then happy.  But slowly the two build a friendship.<br /><br />It's Leslie's idea to create a magical kingdom.  In Terabithia, anything they can imagine goes.  They are the rulers and must fight against the evil creatures of the realm.  Slowly, Leslie's imagination rubs off on Jesse, and he begins to enjoy these games as well.  Their friendship even helps them deal with the bullies they face at school.  But will it help when tragedy strikes?<br /><br />This movie is based on a classic children's novel.  Those familiar with the book need not worry, this movie sticks closely to the book.  For those not familiar with the book, that means pay no attention to the ads you may have seen because this is not a fantasy movie.  The majority of the movie is spent in the realities of fifth grade life.<br /><br />And it has a very bitter sweet ending.  If you are looking for a light film, you will be disappointed.  But it is well worth enduring the sorrow for the beauty of the ending.<br /><br />The original novel was written and set in the 1970's but the movie is given a modern setting.  It only affects little things, and the heart of the story remains unchanged.<br /><br />The acting is top notch, too.  AnnaSophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both newcomers and are perfectly believable as the leads.  The other stand out is Bailee Madison as Jesse's younger sister.<br /><br />My only complaint comes from comparing the movie to the book, a situation in which the movie almost always loses.  I read the book for the first time last month, and was deeply moved by it.  The characters were rich and there was lots of depth to the story.  Naturally, that can't be achieved in a movie.  If the book wasn't so fresh in my mind, I would have enjoyed this version more.  This is a minor complaint, however, since I was as deeply moved by the ending of the movie as I was the book.<br /><br />Don't watch this expecting a light fantasy story.  But by all means do watch it.  You'll be moved by this story of the power that friendship can have on a life.</p></body></html>

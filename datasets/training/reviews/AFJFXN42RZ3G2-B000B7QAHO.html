One cannot deny the dark imagery and the visual effects that make the film a Burton production -- the irony and the dysfunctions of his characters that are played out with each child and their relationship with their parents.  This is the core issue in the film as well as for Wonka's personality; Wonka cannot even say the word p-a-r-e-nt.  The landscape of the film almost depicts a time that has long passed -- the Cold War imagery of espionage, stealing the Wonka candy formula.  The film has traits from past Burton films, such as EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and BIG FISH as well as from other twisted fictitious narratives, LEMONY SNICKET, and forgive me, THE CAT IN THE HAT.  Johnny Depp presents a unique Willy Wonka with his somewhat androgynous appearance that has been suggestive as a cross between the "King of Pop" and Carol Channing. Burton follows the same plotline as the original CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY film, WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY and stays true to Roahl Dhal's novel as well as a few extras that explain Wonka's childhood.<br /><br />CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY by all means does not follow the musical giddiness of the original movie with memorable numbers, such as "The Candyman," "Pure Imagination," and "I've Got a Golden Ticket."  However, the Oompa loompa numbers somewhat fill the void, and proceeds the same as the WILLY WONKA film where each child is eliminated from the factory tour.  The most delicious scene throughout the film is the Wonka chocolate bar, and the river full of hot chocolate amidst the edible green hilly pastures with its cherry candy trees and puffy whipped cream -- how yummy.<br /><br />Overall, the film will indeed entertain and enchant each viewer.  It is appropriate for children eight years-old and older.  However, children under eight years-old should be accompanied with an adult because of particular situations and references that are mentioned in the film that they may not understand.</p></body></html>

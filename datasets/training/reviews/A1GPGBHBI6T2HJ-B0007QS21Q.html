<meta name="summary" content="Not much of Asimov in I, Robot, but it still was fun to see"></head><body><p>I grew up reading Isaac Asimov like so many young boys in the 70's and once you found his Robot novels and short stories, you really hit the jackpot.  I was very excited to see something like I, Robot put on the big screen using special effects from today.  I KNEW it would be visually stunning (which it was) but I also instinctively knew that without Will Smith's sense of humorous acting, the movie would never break even at the box office.  I believe I was right.<br /><br />Whether you like or hate Will Smith, he has a pretty deep understanding of which movies he should accept for blockbuster appeal.  So far he has a rather impressive group of hits under his belt...really BIG hits.  Without going out too far on a limb, one could successfully argue that in the new century, he is taking over Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford's throne of major box office successive hits.  While Tom still has quite a bit of mileage left in him, Harrison hasn't given Hollywood any Super Hit for quite some time.  A few modest money making movies here and there, but absolutely nothing on the scale he delivered through the bulk of the 80's through the mid 90's.  Will Smith also has something that both Tom and Harrison lack:  genuine appeal in both action, sci-fi AND comedies.  Check out his movies if you disagree.<br /><br />Back to I, Robot.  The plot was so-so.  The effects were Top Notch and very well done, but they would have to be in order to attract Smith to a roll such as this.  If the effects fail, the entire movie does.  Will is a robo-phobic cop who distrusts robots with almost fantaticism.  It is disturbing those around him including his boss.  Robots simply CANNOT commit crimes because they are hard-wired with the 3 Laws of Robotics, originated by the late-great Isaac Asimov himself.  They are perfect and I dare-say that should robotics become possible as they are in this movie, they would be hard-wired with these same laws.  No robot in HISTORY has EVER committed a crime of ANY kind.  And yet Will's character (Dell Spooner) believes not only CAN they, but they WILL, and when they do, it will entirely take mankind by surprise.<br /><br />As the movie opens, Dell is called to investigate what is apparently a suicide by the man credited for creating the greatest robotic revolution in history.  But IS it suicide, or was he killed by a rogue version of the newest robot which is hitting the streets within the week?  All evidence, on the surface point to the fact that suicide is the ONLY logical answer.  But Dell, hating robots as he does, looks at the situation from a completely different angle and begins to ask the tough questions...forcing people to begin to question his sanity in general.  But as it turns out, and as virtually everybody who sees this movie will know from the first frame, that Dell will be proven correct in his assumptions, but exactly HOW is the big question.  Who is behind all of this?  Was it the scientist who committed suicide?  Was it the robot himself?  OR, was it the CEO of the company poised to introduce the world to the largest robotic distribution ever?  Good questions, and fun answers along the way.  Don't expect your intellect to be stretched during this movie and you should enjoy it all the more.  Simply put, a pretty decent example of eye candy put together with great effects.  Will Smith continues to exceed in picking the winners.</p></body></html>

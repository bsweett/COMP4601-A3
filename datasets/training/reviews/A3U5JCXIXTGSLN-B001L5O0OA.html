<meta name="summary" content="By Far the Absolute BEST!"></head><body><p>&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is my all-time favorite movie so there is absolutely nothing bad I can say about it!<p>Set in the 1940's, the story revolves around Ralphie, a nine-year-old growing up in the midwest, who only wants one thing for Christmas: a bb gun. The movie follows Ralphie, his friends, and family through hilarious adventures, most of them revolving around the bb gun.<p>Laughs abound in this movie and you can't help but cheer for Ralphie when he finally receives his coveted Christmas gift. <p>Every Christmas I watch this movie and still cannot get enough of it. Although I own it both on VHS and DVD, I can't help but watch the 24-hour marathon on TNT on Christmas Eve. <p>This is one movie that is a classic and will be loved for many generations to come! I STRONGLY recommend watching this movie! I know there will not be one thing you dislike about it!</p></body></html>

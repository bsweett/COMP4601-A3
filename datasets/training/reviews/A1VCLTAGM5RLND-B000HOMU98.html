The film is harsh and doesn't turn a blind eye to the atrocities of Vietnam. Kubrick is the true master of atmosphere in film. He makes you feel like your there. Friends of mine have commented that they only like the first half of the film and the second half just falls apart. The first half is set up to be an understandable reflection of the terror that would eventually enter lives of these soliders during war.</p></body></html>

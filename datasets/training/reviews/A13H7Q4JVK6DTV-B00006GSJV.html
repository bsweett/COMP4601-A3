<meta name="summary" content="Truth is this movie is pretty boring but the twist is good."></head><body><p>I bought this movie because everybody was saying it was good but when I saw it I thought it was long and boring I mean in order to see it you need a dictionary to understand each word they say in it or be really smart , but what I found interesting was the twist which fooled me and I like it because how it was presented. The dvd has lots of stuff for you to watch which is pretty good but thats about it.</p></body></html>

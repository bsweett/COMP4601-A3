<meta name="summary" content="These Hogs Were Born To Be Wild..."></head><body><p>Here is a movie that I figured I knew how it would turn out from the get-go. The premise was that of four buddies who love to go riding their motorcycles together on weekends calling themselves Wild Hogs, and throughout the rest of the week lead rather dull, boring lives. So, with that premise being obvious from the trailers I thought the movie looked alright, it appeared to have plenty of humor from its rather talented ensemble cast comprised of Tim Allen ("The Santa Clause"), John Travolta ("Ladder 49"), Martin Lawrence ("Big Momma's House"), and William H. Macy ("Cellular"), but I wondered if all the funny parts were in the preview, a problem that many comedies seem to fall prey to. However, upon its release movie audiences were praising it as being one of the funniest films of the year, and a must see movie. This of course made me curious, so one night my wife and I decided to go see a movie and "Wild Hogs" turned out to be the one we wound up going to see. And let me tell you we were absolutely rolling with laughter, as was the rest of the audience.<br /><br />"Wild Hogs" is the story of four friends, as I stated earlier, who are all having some form of mid-life crisis, and they decide to take a road trip on their motorcycles across the country. With no plan, no map, and no cell phones, just them and the road, these four guys are in for the ride of their lives. However, their trip doesn't always go as smoothly as they'd hope, after having some rather embarrasing mishaps that they'd love nothing more than to forget about, these four friends decide to stop off at a bar for a drink. Except this isn't any ordinary bar, it's a biker bar belonging to a dangerous biker gang known as the Del Fuegos, who don't take too kindly to wannabe bikers in their territory. So will these 'Hogs' survive their road trip adventure or find that sometimes it doesn't pay to be wild.<br /><br />This is one movie that definitely surprised me by how good it really was. What surprised me the most was the fact that for being an ensemble comedy it was absolutely hilarious throughout the entire duration, and each of the lead actors had their fair share of the laughs to give. To me, the most surprising of the entire cast was William H. Macy. I've always thought he was a good actor, but never thought of him as much of a funnyman, but all that changed with this movie. He was by far the absolute funniest of the 4 main actors. Don't get me wrong Tim Allen gives his most hilarious performance since his run on "Home Improvement", John Travolta's never been this funny, and Martin Lawrence hasn't been this on his game since the first "Big Momma's House". But it's William H. Macy's performance that is most memorable. Ray Liotta as the lead biker was a good choice for the villain, and it was obvious he was having fun playing the role opposite such comedic talent and he even had a couple of humorous moments to shine in.<br /><br />The story was actually much better than I predicted it to be, with plenty of surprise cameos, and humorous setups and one-liners, it was nice to see a comedy that didn't rely purely on sight-gags and slapstick. Director Walt Becker is no stranger to comedy after helming the hilarious "Van Wilder", but this was definitely a different type of comedy for him. "Van Wilder" was a very adult-oriented, raunchy comedy as most National Lampoon movies are, but "Wild Hogs" is a fairly family friendly film that doesn't fall back on the run-of-the-mill sex jokes or fart gags; instead, this film survives on the terrific comedic timing of its talented cast and well-paced script. "Wild Hogs" is one extremely funny ride of a movie that the whole family should enjoy, especially those with a penchant for motorcycles and road trips.<br /><br />"Wild Hogs" is rated PG-13 for language and mild violence.</p></body></html>

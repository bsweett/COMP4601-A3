<meta name="summary" content="The Sultan of Spin"></head><body><p>Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is a lobbyist for the tobacco industry; he's very good at spinning facts and convincing people that smoking is their American right.  His young son isn't so sure about the ethics of Dad's job, however.<br /><br />This is a very funny, sarcastic movie.  I've seen Eckhart before but was never impressed, until now.  He is perfect as the fast-talking lobbyist with his dazzling smile and charismatic charm.  The cast is full of good actors in small but witty roles:  William H. Macy plays an anti-cigarette senator, Rob Lowe is wonderfully slimy as a Hollywood publicity man, Robert Duvall plays the tobacco boss, and Sam Elliott is the Marlborough Man.  It's filmed in a quasi-documentary style with lots of deadpan humor.  No one actually smokes in the movie, which is a good thing considering the cancer statistics that are quoted.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film; it really delivers big laughs while poking fun at the tobacco fat cats.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Independently Exciting Sci-Fi Action/Adventure!"></head><body><p>Independently Exciting Sci Fi!<br /><br />Director Roland Emmerich, who has pumped out exciting sci-fi like Stargate and not so great sci-fi such as 10,000 B.C., combined a 4th of July holiday with an alien invasion story.<br /><br />The plot attempts to gain our sympathy with broken relationships, healing and desire as well as attracting our fanboy side with lots of explosions and air fights.  The aliens themselves are almost inconsequential.<br /><br />The film has plot inaccuracies and just plain silliness: uploading a computer virus to an alien craft that has Windows -- how cool is that? Or an unknown force field technology that somehow shows up on Earth's radar screens.<br /><br />But despite the quibbles on the hackneyed dialogue and inaccurate science, there is a lot to say about Bill Pullman's acting. He is an ineffective president who not only rises to the occasion, but takes command and even goes into battle himself.<br /><br />The drunk test pilot who sacrifices himself and regains his children's respect.<br /><br />The old Black & White Day the Earth Stood Still plays momentarily on a TV screen in homage.<br /><br />It's quite the action fest.<br /><br />Recommended to all Americans.</p></body></html>

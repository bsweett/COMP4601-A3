<meta name="summary" content="An Excellent Set If You Can Get Your Hands On It"></head><body><p>Brendan Fraser heads up the cast of two of the three films in "The Mummy Collector's Set."  It's a nice compilation of the first two "Mummy" flicks and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's vehicle, "The Scorpion King."  Odds are that if you've watched these films and enjoyed them, this is a great boxed set for you to pick up.  A newer set was released this year, which includes the first two "Mummy" films and the latest installment of the series, "Tomb of the Dragon Emperor."  "The Scorpion King" is not included in that set, but can be purchased on its own (as can all four of these films).<br /><br />The first two films are similar, with the Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) being raised from the dead and hoping to bring back is lost love in the first film (and unleashing plagues on the world) and his lost love attempting to bring him back (as well as the Scorpion King) to take over the world.  In their way in both films is Rick O'Connell (Fraser), Evelyn and Jonathan (Rachel Weisz, John Hannah) and Ardeth Bay (the underused Oded Fehr).<br /><br />The third film, "The Scorpion King," is a pure action/popcorn flick littered with comedy in the same vein as "Hercules:  The Legendary Journeys."  Dwayne Johnson and Michael Clarke Duncan lead this film that is something of a prequel to the other films.  You do not need to watch this film in order to understand anything going on in the other two and vice versa.  This film stands apart as its own entity.<br /><br />Special features range from outtakes and deleted scenes to a couple of brief documentaries on Egyptology.  There are also a couple of music videos and a look at the "real" Scorpion King.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for big action, big effects and big bad guys, pick up "The Mummy Collector's Set."  I also recommend "Tomb of the Dragon Emperor."  The only shortfall of that film is the fact that Weisz did not reprise her role in it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)"></head><body><p>This abstract romantic-comedy by writer/director Michel Gondry is given the boundary-less treatment one would expect from a loopy sci-fi pic. Teaming with famed playwright Charlie Kaufman, Gondry delivers a genuine love story that links the emotionally distant Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) with the effervescent, free-spirited Clementine (Kate Winslet). Unbeknownst to them, they just ended a relationship with each other. But in their yearning to move on, they had their memories erased by a medical firm based in New York--well, Joel almost did...until he woke up during the procedure, turning his world into one of mental confusion and illogicality.<br /><br />Gondry is a visionary, and Eternal Sunshine is both his crowning work as an artist and one of the most innovative, audacious comedies of the last decade.</p></body></html>

I'm not telling you.<br /><br />Thirty minutes into the film, I started wishing I didn't watch it at home and was at the theater. Being a period film (and not just a period film) , Zodiac manages to switch timeline from the 60's to the 70's and holds your attention quite keenly. The dialogues, the acting, the sets, locations, cars and the film's music and overall spirit is hardly underwhelming.<br /><br />Zodiac is the story of a serial killer who loves leaving clues. This is just a mere statement from the film without any over-bearing significance. HOWEVER,  what is most interesting about his manner of killing are the clues he leaves in newspapers, at parking lots, on the bodies of the victims, on greeting cards and on mails addressed to the newspapers and on conversations with victims, police and media.<br /><br />Although it is like Seven, Zodiac is a different Seven of it's own. It's pace doesn't really allow you to judge it, instead it poses in many ways and decorates itself and the sheer energy, enthusiasm and work that has gone behind making this film a success is hearty. Forget all that, take for instance, the scenes involving phone booth sequences, the double questioning of the integrity of each character, the vague semi-conclusions, the way people would sit around T.V waiting for news to unfold, those recorder tapes that remind you of a movie called "The Conversation" and what not - ensure a great film watching experience.<br /><br />The murders were very enjoyable. You will love the doubt. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the film. People who loved Departed - would like to give Zodiac a chance.<br />This is maybe the best film I have seen in 2007 although I haven't seen too many. You will also fall in love with "Hurdy Gurdy Man" by Donovan. The song truly reflects the rage this film tries so hard to build up.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal, fantastic work. David Fincher, RESPECT!</p></body></html>

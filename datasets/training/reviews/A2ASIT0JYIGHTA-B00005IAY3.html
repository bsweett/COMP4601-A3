<meta name="summary" content="Close encounters doesn't cut it as classic cinema"></head><body><p>Can you believe, I have never seen CEO3K until the other week.  I looked forward to seeing it, but unfortunately it did not measure up. After hearing mixed reviews (so many of them referred to it as 'boring'), I was prepared to give it a go.<br /><br />Close Encounters is very slow moving, with the occassional interesting thing occurring, but it is not until the end where something interesting happens.  And even then, I expected more.  I was left thinking "is that it, after all that slow build-up?".  Many scenes during the film are just too stupid for words.<br /><br />I have viewed the 2-Disc collector's edition which apparently is a combination of the Director's Cut and the original theatrical version. For a first timer to the film, it made no difference to me. However, as fans of the film have stated, the tampering by Spielberg for this special edition was not appreciated.  He re-edited the original version removing scenes that perhaps gave it its popularity (eg. Dreyfuss entering the mothership).  Spielberg has said he will never re-instate these scenes. Doesn't it annoy you when a Director refuses to let people see a film the way they originally remember?  It's almost a kick in the teeth for helping him make his millions.  Oh well, at least he had the decency to allow the original 'untouched' version of E.T. to be included on the 2002 digitally enhanced version DVD.<br /><br />The second disc of CE3K contains the extras which I guess would be gold for fans of the film. The DVD overall is a limited edition and at a price too - I am surprised at the price considering the film isn't that great.  I wish someone could enlighten me on why this film is considered a classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Historical, Tragic, and Comical"></head><body><p>This is an interesting movie in that it is not only based on something historical, but it combines tragedy and comedy rather well.<br /><br />Very quickly, we see that Frank Jr loves both his parents. And they appear to be a well off functional family. Later, a financial crisis hits, and their living standards are reduced drastically. He still loves both his parents, but we can see that he is starting to lean towards his father. After he realizes that they are getting divorced, he can't handle it and runs away. A gem of comedy from Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) is when he tries to make Frank Jr's decision as to who he will live with easier: "Frank, just put my name down."<br /><br />After this tragic beginning, the comedy kicks in. Frank Jr. goes from being financially wrecked to financially stuffed. First he impersonates a pilot. At this point, the FBI agent Tom Hanks comes in. While the movie leads us into cheering for Frank Jr., it does NOT make the mistake of allowing us to hate the Tom Hanks character. (We are also permitted a moment of sympathy for him when he realizes his team is not exactly an 'elite squad.') Tom Hanks and Frank Jr. cross, but Frank Jr. avoids capture. (This is when Frank Jr. starts taunting Tom Hanks with telephone calls.)<br /><br />Frank Jr. then goes on to impersonate a doctor. At this point tensions are released. Tom Hanks has lost thew trail; and Frank Jr. meets a woman who he may want to spend his life with. A small unbelievable element here is that Frank Jr. and she jump ship just when Tom Hanks has picked up the trail again.<br /><br />Moving on, Frank Jr. decides it is time to impersonate a lawyer now. At this point he is tired from running, but too late he realizes that you can't just steal $4,000,000. and call a truce. It is worth noting that if Tom Hanks had not seen Frank Jr's face, Frank Jr. may have had a chance to go back to a normal life.<br /><br />The deception is understandably starting to wear Frank Jr. down, and in a comical manner, he slips under the FBI agents and makes his way to Europe. If I say much more, I'll probably ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it.<br /><br />I'll just say it is an interesting end with elements of both sorrow and reconciliation. All in all, it's an interesting combination of history, tragedy, and comedy.</p></body></html>

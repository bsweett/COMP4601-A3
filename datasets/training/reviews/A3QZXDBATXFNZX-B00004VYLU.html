<meta name="summary" content="A Very Good Movie"></head><body><p>Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is one of the best films of all time everything in this movie is good. But the DVD is not nothing speciel. The violence is not as bad as what people have been saying its bad. But if you think this is violent take a look at Meance II Society or Casino which are far worst in that. Anyway good movie but not so good DVD.</p></body></html>

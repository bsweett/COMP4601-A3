<meta name="summary" content="Very predictable and painful to watch"></head><body><p>I did not find this movie enjoyable to watch.  Within its genre, it is probably very well done - obviously very good acting, good production values, good tension, good character development, etc.  I would like to call out the director/dop specifically, very strong camera work.  My problem though is in several other areas.  First, this is the story of a 50's family struggling with conforming to societal norms and mediocrity; they work their way back to a mid-life picker-upper, but the (SPOILER) story is obviously setting the couple up for failure.  The very predictability of the story made it less satisfying of a watch.  Second, like the Greeks of old, I watch movies as a form of entertainment and/or escapism.  While I am very happy in my life, I do feel surrounded by the types of people depicted in this film - those who feel lost in their hopelessly empty existence.  So in effect, I'm watching a movie that is nothing more than a semi-artistic recreation of the world around me...down my street.  Boring and antithetical to my motivations for watching movies in the first place.  Despite my disdain, though, I must say that Kate Winslet deserved her recognition, and is an outstanding actress, and her husband did an outstanding job of directing.</p></body></html>

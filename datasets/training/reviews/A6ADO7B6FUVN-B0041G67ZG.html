This is also the easiest way of communicating, as it quickly can convey the meaning of something important.  When communicating in a different language, skills are necessary to decipher the foreign language.  If the language skills are lacking, or not proficient, it could lead to misinterpretations, which could have dire consequence.  Thus, it is essential for an interpreter to be able to translate a language proficiently without errors in order to eliminate misunderstandings.  When Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) works at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York, she translates different languages and she is fully aware of the importance of clear and concise interpretation.<br /><br />The Interpreter opens in Matobo, a small African nation amidst brutal ethnic cleansing, where the audience witnesses the cruelty of weapons and hateful teachings.  This brutality provides some hints to what the story is about, yet it leaves the audience in complete darkness as it is not clear how these characters are related to the story, as it takes place in New York.  One evening after a failing metal detector Silvia returns to her working place, the UN Headquarters, to pick up a bag that she left behind.  As Silvia enters the room with her bag she accidentally hears a conversation in a foreign langauge, which she was not intended to hear.  What was said, remains a mystery to the audience, as subtitles are not provided, which enhances the suspense in the story.<br /><br />Eventually Silvia figures out the seriousness of the conversation that she overheard, as she reports it to the security of the UN Headquarters.  Consequently, the Secret Service arrives to the location in order to investigate the situation headed by Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) who personally is struggling with the loss of his wife.  When Tobin and Silvia meet for the first time there is tension, as Tobin finds her insincere, yet he cannot place his finger on what makes him feel this way.  Nonetheless, the audience learns while the story unfolds that this political thriller has a several layers colored by personal feelings and powerful political undercurrents sweeping through the UN and the Big Apple.  Cleverly, the director Sydney Pollack only discloses the crucial facts at the critical moment, yet it is also here where some of the weakness rest within the story.<br /><br />One of the more important notions conveyed through the film is the importance of forgiveness.  Initially, Silvia tells Tobin about a custom in Matobo where they do not utter the name of the dead until the mourning feel that they can move on.  She also tells him about the tradition where they throw a murderer into the river while the surviving victims can choose to save or let the murderer drown.  If the survivors decide to let the person drown they live and will continue to live in disharmony, as they have acquired their vengeance.  Yet, harmony can be salvaged by saving the murderer from drowning.  Another layer of the story that Pollack illustrates is the blindness of vengeful hatred and anger, which flushes away any kind of existing sympathy.  Tobin thoroughly describes in a scene what he would do to the murderer, as clouded thoughts prevent him from seeing nothing but retribution.  The film cleverly depicts the aftermath of anger while it balances with harmonious forgiveness through both Tobin and Sylvia who are mere pawns in the big political game at the UN Headquarters.<br /><br />The Interpreter offers an intelligent political thriller that does balance human emotions with politics through the main characters.  Being able to shoot the film on location, the UN Headquarters, helped developed a genuine atmosphere where the audience can feel the tension between the nations and the individuals in the film.  It also offers an opportunity for the audience to reflect over the seriousness of the matter in the backdrop of recent political events in the world, which also builds up more anticipation and suspense.  Yet, the true treasure of the film rests within the emotional aspect of the story, as it provides a honorable lesson of human existence.  Unfortunately, some of these aspects come across a little too strong, as it almost feels too blissful and overly righteous.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Perhaps a Little Too Historically Correct"></head><body><p>The movie industry has been well-known for taking books and history and changing it to suit their cinematic needs. Kingdom of Heaven isn't one of those films, and after watching it, I now know why directors and writers change things. While it isn't entirely true (some of the early scenes in the movie were fake), most of it is, including the characters and battles that happens. It does keep your interest all the way up until the end, where it will then leave you feeling a little cheated. Without spoiling much, I can say that this is where the director Ridley Scott should have applied the Hollywood touch.<br /><br />This is a great movie for those who love world history or for those who love epics (like me). Beyond that, I wouldn't recommend it.</p></body></html>

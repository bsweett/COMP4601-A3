Certainly, it's gorgeous to look at, and the past and present episodes were quite good, but the future segment totally escaped me. Clint Mansell's score won awards, but I thought the new-age sound was quite unexceptional and repetitive. The cast was fine, especially Rachel Weisz, and the brief but effective appearance of Ellen Burstyn. Hugh Jackman handled his very complicated roles admirably. I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. The DVD extras provide some insight that the production was plagued by shut-downs and delays. With budget cuts and other hang-ups, I'm sure the result isn't the film that Mr. Aronofsky set out to make.</p></body></html>

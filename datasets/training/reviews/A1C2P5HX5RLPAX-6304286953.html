Wet and hungry they venture into a small country village where they stop in at the Slaughtered Lamb hoping to eat and warm up. They come across some eccentric residents who are anything but warm and are encouraged to leave even though it's late and the full moon is out. Shortly after leaving they venture off the main road onto the moors where they are attacked by a creature of the night.<br /><br />David (played by David Naughton) is the only one who survives the attack but he's having horribly gory dreams and his mutilated dead friend Jack (Griffin Dunne) keeps coming to him, in various degrees of decay, and telling him he should kill himself before the next full moon. One of the ways David remains sane is hooking up with his nurse, Alex Price (Jenny Agutter / Logun's Run).<br /><br />An American Werewolf in London was written and directed by John Landis who also directed the movie Animal House and Michael Jackson's Thriller video. It was filmed entirely in Wales, London and Middlesex, England. This is one of the best horror movies of all time with incredibly detailed make-up effects by Rick Baker that still hold up for today's viewers. Baker set the standards for future monster movies.<br /><br />I love the music too. It's addictive. Probably because there are only three songs throughout: Bad Moon Rising (Creedance Clearwater Revival), Moondance (Van Morrison) and three renditions of Blue Moon (Sam Cooke, The Marcels and Bobby Vinton).<br /><br />This is one of my favorite all-time movies. There's comedy (a bit campy at times), there's blood and guts, there's wolf lore and there's a white guy running around in his birthday suit in the middle of the London. I've seen this film dozens of times and enjoy it every time. It's a must see film for horror buffs and werewolf fans. Reviewed by M. E. Wood.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The last film made by the great cinematographer Conrad Hall"></head><body><p>The publicity for "Road to Perdition" is all about actors Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, but it did not take long into this film for me to decide the two stars are cinematographer Conrad Hall and composer Thomas Newman.  Both are deservedly up for Oscars for this 2002 film because "Road to Perdition" is ultimately pictures and music.  Hall died last month and won his second Oscar for his previous film, "American Beauty," and it will be interesting to see how those two factors affect the voters, but this is a gorgeous film.  Almost as strong is the music by Thomas Newman, although the piano duet played by Hanks and Paul Newman was written by John Williams.  It is not surprising that several of the pivotal scenes of the film are without dialogue, or with the spoken words muted, because the performances are etched more by visuals than words (and the standout performance of the film is Jude Law).<p>The film is based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner, which was clearly inspired by the epic Japanese manga "Lone Wolf & Cub" by Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima, the final volume of which was just published in the United States. The parallels are in general terms: a skilled assassin forced to flee with his son, but planning vengeance.  Instead of feudal Japan the story is set in the Great Depression in and around Chicago.  However, while "Lone Wolf & Cub" provides the essential premise of the film the end game is decidedly different (think John Wayne's final film "The Shootist").  The final pivotal scene of "The Road to Perdition" represents the film perfectly: I knew what was going to happen but it was photographed beautifully.  Again, you might be seeing Tom Hanks, but you are thinking Conrad Hall.  Talk about going out at the top of your game: a beautiful legacy.</p></body></html>

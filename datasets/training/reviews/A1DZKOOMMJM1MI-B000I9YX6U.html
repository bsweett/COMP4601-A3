<meta name="summary" content="Snap-You're Dead!!!"></head><body><p>Robin Williams gives an impressive and stunning performance in this chilling story of a photo developer who becomes obsessed with a woman and her seemingly perfect family through the series of pictures he develops for them. <p>"Sy" Perish, the "photo guy" seems like a nice enough man who takes extra care with the photos of the people who come to his counter. Unfortunately for Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsn), her husband (Michael Vartan) and their son Jake (Dylan Smith), Sy is not who he appears to be. As Sy's life becomes lonelier and his obsession with the family grows, he convinces himself that he's part of their seemingly picture-perfect life. What happens next will leave your spine tingling. <p>Directed by Mark Romanek, this edge-of-the-seat thriller is one of the best in recent years, refreshigly not going the Hollywood route with a conventional ending. The climax is shocking, disturbing, and extremely suspenseful and creepy. <p>Sy Parish is a unique villian who manages to make you care for him despite the lives he successfully manages to destroy. Robin Williams is perfection in a rare film role for him. His supporting cast, which also includes Eric La Salle and Gary Cole, are also top-notch. You will never look at the One Hour Photo Shop the same way again. This is one thriller I definitely recommend.</p></body></html>

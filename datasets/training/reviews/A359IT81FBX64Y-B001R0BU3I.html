<meta name="summary" content="Typical action flick"></head><body><p>This is a typical American action flick in the sense that it features a really smart and tough hero character, in this case Don Cheadle, who is able to outsmart and outfight just about anybody, good guys and bad guys alike. Maybe one reason this film didn't do so well at the box office is because it doesn't have quite as much action as most action movies, for which I give it credit. Also unlike most action movies it doesn't have any super evil villains. There are terrorists, of course, but you see them as people and not just as cardboard bad guys. Then again, a movie portraying Muslims only as evil terrorists and Americans only as good guys would stir things up, wouldn't it?<br /><br />At the end of the movie there is some preachiness about Muslims being used, misguided, and misled, and there is no serious effort to explore the roots of terrorism. One could just as well examine the motivations of homegrown terrorists like Timothy McVeigh. The end of the movie also sets up the obvious sequel, but perhaps there will be no sequel after all.<br /><br />Even with its redeeming qualities, Traitor suffers the same flaw as other action films: implausibility. But that doesn't bother fans of action films. The only reason it bothers me is because I'm not a fan of action films. True action fans may want more action and special effects than this film dishes out.</p></body></html>

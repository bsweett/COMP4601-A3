This is not the groundbreaking film you would be led to believe.  The docu-style filmmaking isn't exactly groundbreaking and it's been done before and better.  You might raise an eyebrow when you consider that it was done on a lower budget, $30 million, than your average Hollywood flick but that passes.  The Johannesburg locations are certainly exotic.  The analogy to apartheid is trite and obvious.  This flick certainly isn't in the same league as "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" or the first two "Alien" movies.  The best you can say about "District 9" is it moves pretty good and keeps your attention throughout.  Just don't confuse it as something significant because it certainly is not that.</p></body></html>

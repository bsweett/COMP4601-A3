The film concerns a forgotten period in New York City's history when a variety of gangs controlled the five corners area. Corrupt politicians, the draft (for the Civil War) and a massive wave of immigrants created a turbulent environment. A huge anti-immigrant campaign helped fuel the many conflicts between the various gangs. Scorsese also incorporates a real riot that occuried during this time. The riot required army troops to come in and prevent further looting and murder.<p>The basic story focuses on the conflict between two rival groups--the Natives led by Bill &quot;the Butcher&quot; and the Dead Rabbits an Irish immigrant group led by &quot;Priest&quot; (Liam Neeson). Their conflict leads to the death of Priest witnesses by his young son Amsterdam (later played by Leonard DiCaprio). The Butcher arranges to have the child sent to a Reform school where he's raised by Catholic Priests.<p>Upon his release Amsterdam goes looking for Bill with revenge his primary goal. What Amsterdam finds is a changed world; the Natives control much of the corrupt police force and politicians in the five corners area. Bill is well regarded and, in fact, many of the Priest's old gang members work for Bill now. Amsterdam eventually meets Bill and is treated like a son by Bill. This creates a considerable conflict as Amsterdam has developed a gruding respect for the terrifying Butcher. His life is further complicated when he becomes involved with a woman (Cameron Diaz)who was saved by the Butcher as a child. <p>The production design is stunning capturing a time in New York's history that had been long forgotten by many of its residents. The shacks, stores and buildings that make up the five corners area have an authentic appearence to them. Scorsese and his production designer Dante Ferretti manage to make the audience not only feel the environment but taste and smell it as well.  Director of photography Michael Ballhaus lighting brings a rustic feel to the environment. <p>The major problem with the film is the screenplay. It clearly passed through a number of hands besides the three screenwriters credited (Jay Cocks, Steven Zallian and Kenneth Lonergon). The first two-thirds of the film are classic Scorsese; there's a vibrantcy to the script missing from the last third. That's the problem with the film--it's two-thirds a classic. During the last act the film literally falls apart and is very narratively disjoined. It's clear that Scorsese had a much longer cut of the film in mind; there's a lot that appears to be missing from the film cut, no doubt, to make the already long running time (167 minutes) functional for a movie theater. Since this is the DVD edition, I'm surprised that Scorsese didn't go back and recut the film adding extended dramatic sequences that might have made the last third a stronger act.<p>The acting by Daniel Day-Lewis (completely immersed in his character of Bill) is stunning. His falt, slightly rounded New York accent is as much a part of the character as can be imagined. The rest of the cast give varying performances with varying success when it comes to their Irish accents. Leonard DiCaprio makes a valient attempt to equal Day-Lewis but ultimately comes up slightly short of the perfection of Day-Lewis' performance. Still, he's believable in the role and manages to command your attention when he's on screen. <p>Cameron Diaz also makes a game attempt with her role. Her character really doesn't come to life until the middle of the film. Henry Thomas (E.T., Psycho 4) gives a memorable and solid performance as Amsterdam's friend. It's a role that could have been pushed into the shadows by the lead character but Thomas invests his character with a quiet, powerful presence. <p>Scorsese's direction is sharp and it's clear he's thought long and hard about how he wanted to present this picture. His confident direction keeps the momentum of the film from dragging and, until the last act, he knows exactly where he's going and what he's trying to achieve.<p>The DVD transfer is, generally, exceptional.  The picture is nearly flawless with few of the digital compression problems that have marred similarly epic films. There's virtually no analog artifacts and the print used here is crisp, clear and clean. The 5.1 sound mix and is also representative of what you might have heard in the theater. There were some problems with the discs. The first disc ends rather abruptly. There's a scene on the second disc where the music is mixed a bit too loud for the sequence and there appears to be other sounds leaking through the mix that shouldn't be there. <p>The extras are profuse. There's a nicely done costume design feaurette and a sequence where the audience can explore the sets for the film. Additionally, there's a documentary (originally shown on The Discovery Channel)that focuses on this little known time from New York's past. It's much more than a glorified promo for the film. Scorsese's commentary is, shall we, say effusive and interesting. His intelligent comments and observations make the film come alive a second time.  While I like U2, I could have done without the music video and would much rather have seen an a couple of interviews with Day-Lewis and other cast members on their craft.<p>While it's a flawed film, Gangs of New York captures Scorsese in top form throughout most of the film. If the film doesn't hang together the way it should, it's probably due to the fact that Scorsese had to trim more from the film than he would have liked (how else to explain Neeson's appearence in what amounts to a glorified cameo?). Scorsese takes considerable risk in telling the type of story that isn't in vogue with Hollywood any longer. Gangs is an intelligent, well acted drama with a larger than life performance by Daniel Day-Lewis that makes up for some of the films shortcomings. I'd suggest renting it first and, if you like it, move on to purchasing it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is what the opposite of cynicism looks like."></head><body><p>I thought this would be a "feel good" movie, but really it's a "feel bad" movie until the end.  What this man went through to keep his commitment to be there for his son was painful to watch, especially because the movie is based on a true story.<br /><br />I think others have described this film more than adequately, so I'll just try to add a few points here beyond the obvious inspirational quality of the movie.<br /><br />First, the bonus features really are bonuses.  The "making of" documentary is a "must see" after you've watched the movie.  The mini documentary on the Rubics Cube is great too!<br /><br />Second, something some may not notice that I did was the painstaking attention to detail in reproducing the early 1980's.  (This was mentioned in the "making of" documentary)  When we see scenes taken outside where there is a lot of traffic, I saw many cars but not one that was after 1981.  All the appliances, electronic devices, and other set decorations took me right back to about 1980.  Quite amazing.  Way more work went into this movie that you'd expect.<br /><br />This movie shows what the opposite of cynicism looks like.  And, it gave me something to really think about.  Maybe it's the persuit of "happyness" that makes life worthwhile, as much or more than being "happy".<br /><br />Finally, I very much appreciated the fact that the story was ethnically neutral, for lack of a better term.  What I mean is that the situation Chris Gardner found himself in could have happened to anyone regardless of background.  He was essentially a gifted person who made a bad business decision and soon found himself in a desparate situation.  He found some happy people (stock brokers) and decided to persue that happiness, and against the odds he succeeded.</p></body></html>

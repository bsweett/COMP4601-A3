Hitler is portrayed as having horrible views on humanity, but showing  kindness to his secretaries and his dog.<br /><br />The movie is seen through the eyes of his secretary Junge. She doesn't realise the full scope of Hitler's insanity until much later after the war.  The really scary element is the people who remain loyal to Hitler when there is no hope and Hitler is obviously insane. There are the surreal elements of the movie. The generals pinning badges on soldiers and in some cases children when the army is destroyed and only a small remnant is left. Goebel's wife kills her children rather than let them live in a world without National Socialism. Men commiting suicide with their last bullet, when their leader dies in cowardice in a bunker.<br /><br />The movie was poignant, powerful and scary. The Third Reich was not Hitler's dream alone, he was just a catalyst. Hitler was a monster, but he was still human. The movie was extremely violent and disturbing.</p></body></html>

This is primarily due to the great villain played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  He was perfecly cast and delivers great dialogue.  His final fight with Cruise was thrilling and even brought a standing ovation from some in the audience.  The editing and pacing of the film was also perfect-I never felt bored or overloaded with action.  Cruise was good as usual and if you can overlook his kookiness you will enjoy this movie.</p></body></html>

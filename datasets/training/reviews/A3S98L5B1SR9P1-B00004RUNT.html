<meta name="summary" content="The Fifth Element"></head><body><p>The Fifth Element is an overall superbly done film, well-acted as it is hilariously entertaining. Not the best actor around, Chris Tucker gives a hilarious performance as a near psychotic radio host, and Bruce Willis is the hero as he is in much of every film he plays in. The music for The Diva (who is brutally murdered) is performed superbly and is gorgeously sung.</p></body></html>

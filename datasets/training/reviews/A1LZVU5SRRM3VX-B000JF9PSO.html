<meta name="summary" content="Riveting and Gut-wrenchingly powerful"></head><body><p>Every once in awhile, a film comes along that is so understated that it blows me away, and this was such a film.  By concentrating on the mundane details that the passengers, crew, and air traffic controllers were dealing with at the time of the attacks on America, Greengrass puts together a stunningly cinema verite representation of the actual events.<br /><br />By using all unknown actors (as well as a few actual ATC staff, playing themselves) the director sensitively portrays the confusion, the conflict, the struggle, and the heroism that ensued.  At its core, United 93 is a human tragedy, and Greengrass' meticulous, real-time recreation of every moment from boarding to impact reminds us of the human impact of the event.<br /><br />The film is extremely intense and realistic, but if the viewer can handle the underlying reality of the film, it is well worth the emotional toll it inflicts on the viewer.  For a more emotionally wrenching tragic/heroic double feature, consider watching United 93 and Oliver Stone's equally intense World Trade Center in one sitting.  You'll be haunted by the ghosts of that terrible day when the world, quite literally came crashing down around us, and recall with terrible clarity your feelings from that day.<br /><br />Some people think it is too soon to open these wounds from which our country is still healing, but these sensitive profiles in courage stand as a fitting memorial to those who lost their lives on that terrible day in our nation's history.</p></body></html>

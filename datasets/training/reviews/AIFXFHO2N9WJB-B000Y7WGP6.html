There have been several films that have tried to make essentially the same political statement over and over, such as "President Bush is wrong" or "This current war is unjust" or "It's all about the oil", examples of these sentiments would be the overtly political, dramatic films aimed at skewering the current administration or the war effort, such as; "Fahrenheit 9/11", "Lions for Lambs" (surprisingly written by the same writer as this film), or "Syriana". Few films these days seem to make any type of attempt to put a favorable light on the war effort or the Bush administration. A recent film release set in Saudi Arabia seemed to actually make an attempt to keep politics out of the film, or at least not focus on it, opting instead to merely show our government and its agencies trying to do the right thing by assisting others and showing the kind of jeopardy our soldiers face on a daily basis while doing their job. The film I am referring to is director Peter Berg's ("The Rundown" and "Friday Night Lights") high-octane military thriller "The Kingdom", starring Jamie Foxx ("Collateral"), Jennifer Garner ("Daredevil"), and Chris Cooper ("Breach").<br /><br />"The Kingdom" is the story of a team of FBI agents who are assigned to assist the Saudi Arabian government in solving a mass murder of both Saudi and American citizens, and bring the vicious killer responsible to justice before he strikes again. As the team begins their investigation they find themselves hampered by the limitations imposed by the Saudi government officials, and that of their own superiors who wish for them not to get too involved in the proceedings. But, through their sheer determination the team manages to break through these barriers, but just as they do, they find themselves as the newest targets for the very madman they are trying to stop.<br /><br />I am very much impressed by the talent director Peter Berg has for crafting an extremely intense movie experience full of racial tension, wartime conflict, tense drama, and a little bit of political intrigue without resorting to the same old attack the President or the current war tactics used by so many other directors in Hollywood. It's also surprising just how realistic this movie is, and just how serious the subject matter is when compared to the somewhat lighter content in some of his previous films, primarily "The Rundown" and "Friday Night Lights". It's evident that Peter Berg has definitely come a long way as a filmmaker and his movies speak volumes to that sentiment, as does his ability to get A-list stars for each of his films from Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson ("The Rundown") to Billy Bob Thornton ("Friday Night Lights") to Oscar winner Jamie Foxx for "The Kingdom". This is one director whose films seem to attract some of the best talent in Hollywood, and have so far appeared to be worth watching.<br /><br />The story for "The Kingdom" is a very tense, action-packed thrill ride that was very well-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan ("Lions For Lambs"). He has crafted an emotionally charged story that could have been ripped right from today's headlines, in fact according to director Peter Berg the film was based loosely on a story about a team of U.S. government agents attempting to assist in some sort of investigation in the Middle East and the hardships they faced in trying to do so. Kudos must also go to Matthew Michael Carnahan, along with director Peter Berg, in regards to resisting the temptation to include as much political leanings in this film as possible, opting instead to keep the focus on the U.S. agents trying to do the right thing, and leaving the politics out of the equation. However, Carnahan must have needed an outlet later on for his pent-up political thoughts that he didn't use in this film, thus releasing them via his overtly liberal script for 2007's "Lions For Lambs" starring Tom Cruise, Robert Redford, and Meryl Streep.<br /><br />The actors were all very impressive in their individual roles, each cast member that comprised the main characters was fully prepared for their roles and it showed. They all went through training courses on how to properly hold and fire weapons, clearing rooms where hostiles may be present, and multiple other military tactics; all of this was done as a conscious effort on the part of the cast and the director to make this film as realistic as possible and to respect what the men and women of our armed forces must go through on a daily basis.<br /><br />In the end, "The Kingdom" is a very well done military thriller that gives us a glimpse at what life is like for our soldiers, and for the people that are living in that region of the world. A very good movie that shouldn't be written off as being just another piece of anti-war propaganda, but as a movie that tries to show our people doing what's right even when their lives, and others we may not agree with, are at stake.<br /><br />"The Kingdom" is rated R for violence and language.</p></body></html>

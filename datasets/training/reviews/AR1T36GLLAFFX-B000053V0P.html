Yep, when you've seen a film a half-dozen times, you know what's going to happen, but when you watch it that sixth time, you are interested to see how well you remember it.  And you get to enjoy the parts you liked before, again.  I'm waiting for the explosions, for the fighter vrs. alien dogfight (OK, it's hard to believe the aliens can conquer the galaxy, but can't hit the broad side of the barn with their advanced weapons), for President Pullman to fight back, and so on.  "Welcome to Earth" indeed!<br /><br />It's an entertaining flick that is enjoyable time and again.  I'm a big Jeff Goldblum fan, and he does his off-kilter bumbling genius schtick again, and really well.  Will Smith is a winning personality, though you wonder how his ego would fare in the modern military...And a positive nod to Randy Quaid, you turns a potentially hokey role into a pretty good performance.<br /><br />Yeah, it ain't Hamlet (big surprise) but compared with its action film cousins, ID4 comes off pretty darn well.<br /><br />Just remember, don't get on top of that skyscraper in LA and hold up a sign welcoming the aliens.  Might just irritate them!<br /><br />Recommended if you like action flicks that are a cut above average.</p></body></html>

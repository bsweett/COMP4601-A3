He is a skeptic, and his writings chronicle the lack of ghosts in these haunted places.  Next on his agenda is room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in New York.  The room  is a prime prospect for him.  The hotel has been around for almost 100 years and 56 people have died in the room.  The manager of the hotel (Jackson) strongly advises Enslin not to go into the room, but Enslin persists and soon finds himself in 1408 for the night.  Soon, he finds that he may have made a mistake, but my then the room will not let him go.<br /><br />"1408" is probably the best horror movie I have seen in a while.  It is even proof that a good horror movie can be made with a PG-13 rating.  This is all due to then fine acting provided by John Cusack, who must carry the movie all by himself for the majority of the film's running time.  Jackson is good in his small role as the hotel's manager, but this is Cusack's movie.  Based on the short story by Stephen King, this film is easily one of the best based on King's work.  I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

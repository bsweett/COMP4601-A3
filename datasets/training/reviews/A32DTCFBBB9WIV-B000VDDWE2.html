Emmerich has been (rightfully) backlashed for soulless stupidities like GODZILLA, THE PATRIOT, etc.... So, when he does a movie about a serious subject, where the action is a lot more slow paced, he fails again...<br /><br />Now, he fails not because of the patriotics, the stupidity, the cliches, whatever... he fails because he wrote a bad screenplay, and obtained half-hearted performances by his lead actors. Jake Gyllenhaal is the worst of them all, it will take some months (or years) to producers around the world give him another chance in something so "big-budgeted".</p></body></html>

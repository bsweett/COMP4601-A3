<meta name="summary" content="Interesting But Flawed Character Study"></head><body><p>Director P.T. Anderson has created a moumental but flawed film about one man's ambition as it comes into conflict with the concept of faith. Based on Upton Sinclair's novel Oil!, There Will Be Blood tells the story of independant oilman Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) as he struggles to get rich in turn of the century America.<br /><br />Day-Lewis,channeling John Huston, gives a career defining performance as a man totally alone in his ambition to become rich. This film is a character study more than an action narrative. Daniel Plainview is a complex man with no friends, no sense of history and presumably no morals as he attempts to control his destiny in the growing oil business. When he comes into conflict with an evangelical preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) true colors are shown and a fight to the finish is begun.<br /><br />The performance by Day-Lewis won him a deserved Best Actor Oscar. Also of note is the great camara work by Richard Elswit and the unique musical score by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead.<br /><br />I viewed the two disc edition which features the film on disc one and special features on the second disc. The special features include 15 minutes of stills and research to a Greenwood score, two trailers and some deleted scenes. These extras run for about 30 minutes. The main feature here is The History of Petroleum (1923-27) a silent black and white film produced by Sinclair Oil and the US Bureau of Mines. This short is also scored by Greenwood.<br /><br />This film is definately worth checking out but may be a better rental than purchase. One further note the packaging on this set is horrible. The discs are squeezed into cardboard sleeves that virtually insure scratching with repeated viewings.</p></body></html>

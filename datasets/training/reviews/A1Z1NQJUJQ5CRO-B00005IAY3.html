<meta name="summary" content="Stay away from this release"></head><body><p>The film  &quot;Close Encounters&quot; is one of the best Spielberg ever directed,some would argue THE best and I would be hard pressed to counter that assertion.<br />This is indeed a wonderful movie ,a film that works on multiple levels and on a grand scale that focuses on the people that have encountered UFOs up close and personal.Spielberg even gave the late Prof. Allen Hynek famed UFO researcher from North Western University a cameo role near the end of the picture to lend it an even more realistic touch.<br />However Spielberg has stated more than once that he would NEVER release the movie as it was originally shown and true to his word he has so far stubbornly carried out his promise.His reasoning on this point totally baffles this reviewer.It IS a wonderful film,what is the problem Mr.Spielberg?<br />Therefore if you  would like to see an uncut/original version of this film,NOTHNG at ths time of writing is available to satisfy your desire.Nor does it look promising for the forseeable future.What a pity.I have viewed every version released on video and DVD and each one changes the feel and direction of the movie in some way and none of them match the impact and intent of the original.<br />Be patient and stay tuned...but dont buy yet!</p></body></html>

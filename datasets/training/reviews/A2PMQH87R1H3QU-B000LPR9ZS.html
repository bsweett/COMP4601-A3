<meta name="summary" content="THIS *SAW III* IS NOT THAT SHARP  !!!"></head><body><p>U know the first SAW, was SCARY and SHOCKING in the end, Frezz me & people in the chair End of "SAW" in the theater!! Everyone  loved it &  shocked! Well everyone I know, I guess just hit the spot.! "SAW 2" was good, I liked it too, But not like the first SAW, But this SAW 3 is kind of looks like a lots flash backs and getting little lame and drama type the flick, I guess really wasn't all that like first saw & saw2, A bit downfall to me. The "SAW" series is kind of like "HOSTEL" scrip.  Well "HOSTEL 2" going to release in theaters soon, Hope they NOT going to screw it up like they did with this SAW3!!I bought first SAW & 2 on DVD ...But this "SAW3" is ok rental instead to Buy!!

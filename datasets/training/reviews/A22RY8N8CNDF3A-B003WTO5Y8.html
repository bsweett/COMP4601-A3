<meta name="summary" content="Chilling Classic -"></head><body><p>Silence of the Lambs is a thriller that only others can aspire to.  Much darker and deeper than most, the stars carry their parts with exquisite, chilling moments from the beginning.  You are reeled in as the beautiful FBI Trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) meets the psychiatrist Hannibal Lechter - "Hannibal the Cannibal" (Anthony Hopkins).<br /><br />The plot winds tight as Lechter is interviewed by Starling at his cell in a Maryland mental Hospital.  The give and take between them grabs your attention and from that point on you are emersed in the mind games and intelligent sparing for information between the two.  The FBI is hopeful that Lechter can go into the mind of a serial killer on the loose, "Buffalo Bill."  Lechter does, but only if Starling will give information about herself in exchange for insight and clues on the killer at large.  Buffalo Bill's current captive is a daughter of a senator and finding her is a riveting and breathless ending.  Through it all, Lechter is respectful of Agent Starling, and understands her own fears and dark secrets.  Oddly, through him she struggles out of her own sad, hidden issues.<br /><br />Silence of the Lambs is both disturbing and yet transformational with the caterpillar turning into a beautiful moth or butterfly theme.  Clarice fights her fears and finds her own strength and courage through Lechter in a odd way.  The film is an unforgettable classic.<br /><br />Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins were made for the parts they played, and they did it to perfection.</p></body></html>

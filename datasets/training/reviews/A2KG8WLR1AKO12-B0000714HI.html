<meta name="summary" content="Goldmember: a charmingly humorous experience"></head><body><p>This latest Austin Powers' film will not win an Academy Awards.  It will also not earn a place on anyone's 100 best movies of all time.  Nonetheless,  I heartedly recommend that you see this somewhat vulgar, scatological, and comedy loaded with never ending sexual double entendres.  The consumer product Preparation H is prominently highlighted.  Do I need to elaborate further? Goldmember will bring at least a smile to your face and has a number of really funny scenes.  Austin Powers must once again save the world from the nefarious Dr. Evil.  The plot doesn't make a bit of sense, but who cares?  No one in their right mind expects<br />Shakespeare or Victor Hugo.  Most viewers have almost certainly seen one or both of the previous Austin Powers' comedic slap stick adventures.  If not, try imagining Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costelo, and the Three Stooges making fun of the James Bond 007 series.<p>It is unfortunate that I mentioned earlier that Goldmember will not garner any major film award nominations.  Mike Myers is brilliant portraying Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard.  Unfortunately, actors specializing in comedy are routinely ignored.  This is not fair, but it is a fact of life.  Goldmember deserves 4 and a half stars.  Both religious conservatives and the politically correct Left will be outraged---but that's their problem.</p></body></html>

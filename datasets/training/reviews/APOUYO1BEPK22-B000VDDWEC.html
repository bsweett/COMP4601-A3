I thought I was going to be watching a zombie movie, but it's really not one (even though you can pretend they are, which a lot of people tend to do). In actuality, England has just been infected with a rage virus thanks to some PETA activists trying to rescue some test subject chimps. Ok maybe they don't work for PETA but you get the gist. And like the title says, within 28 days, all hell breaks lose and England is ravaged and destroyed by people who really should take a chill pill.<br /><br />After the outbreak we meet Jim (Cillian Murphy aka Scarecrow from Batman Begins) who wakes up completely naked (why completely naked I don't know) in a hospital room and it seems he's just been through some surgery. After calling for help, Jim comes to realize he's the last person alive on Earth. Ok not really, but it really does seem like it at first. They did a great job of showing deserted cities and roads and making it seem like he is legend (see what I did there?!).  After some walking, he comes across a church filled with what seems to be a mass suicide. This was definitely a scene I cant forget mainly due to when he says `Hello?' and two infected look up at him really quickly and just stare. CREEPY. Plus lets not forget the priest. As he runs away he comes across a couple of uninfected who help him out. Together they try to survive and come across a radio signal broadcasting help and safety. Together they try to make it to this so called safety.<br /><br />Some might consider the movie a little slow, but I enjoyed the pacing because I really did start to connect with Jim and some of the others. Watching it the first I thought there could've been a bit more action scenes, but after my second sitting, I believe I was wrong. I actually enjoyed just about every minute of it. Also the video quality is not great. Not horrible by no means either, but just not great.<br /><br />The special edition I watched had 3 alternate endings. The first 2 were really dumb and could've been easily just ONE alternate ending. The third though was really good actually. But you have to sit through a story board and not live action scenes, but I promise you it was still good. It basically picks up where the military comes in, but there is no military. Instead they head to a hospital with their little rag tag group and try to save one of their own since the person has been infected. They are told that to cure the person, you have to take out all of his blood and replace it. But this was the problem the director (Danny Boyle) had. How the heck do you clean out all of the blood when one drop could infect you. It was funny to hear how Danny says it though. Nice idea though.<br /><br />In the end I would say to definitely give this movie a shot, especially if you are a zombie fan (even though they aren't zombies) or an `end of the world movie' fan.<br /><br />P.S. - Anyone read `The Walking Dead'? Great, great, great read for us zombie lovers. I always wanted to see a movie for this series, but considering how in depth it's become, I'd much rather see a TV series for it. Like on HBO so we could see the gore. Plus I love how the story starts off in my home town back in Georgia. To cool!</p></body></html>

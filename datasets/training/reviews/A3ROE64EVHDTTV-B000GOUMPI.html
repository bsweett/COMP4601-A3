<meta name="summary" content="Heeeeeeere's horror!!!!!!"></head><body><p>At the height of the Overlook Hotels comes perhaps the height of Kubrik's work.  Of all of Kubrik's work, this so far stands as my personal favourite.<p>The film doesn't follow the story too closely to the book.  There are many scenes from the book that are missing ("Stephen King's The Shining" is a closer adaptation).  But it still follows the basic story about a family who takes care of the Overlook Hotel and confronts ghosts.<p>Kubrik's adaptation offers much to think about.  The way the scenes are established still makes me wonder if all the hauntings are real, or are part of the character's imaginations.  The source of the film's horror stems from a psychological kind of aspect and to me alludes to a greater kind of dark force.  That is to say that the horror of the film is not in the ghosts, but in the characters' growing insanity and darkness.  The madness of the characters is real, and is very well portrayed (especially by Jack Nicholson).<p>For all its brilliant acting and provocative cinematography, this film captures the sheer horror of Stephen King's original novel and shoves it deep in the human mind.</p></body></html>

The story begins as Sandra and dog are leaving the Lake House, a gorgeous all-glass house that is located on and over a piece of a lake, near the shore. Separated from land by a tiny bridge cross, she hesitates at her mailbox to place a letter in it, then drives away in what looks like my first car, a 1968 gold Mustang (except mine had a white convertible top). We next see Keanu pull up to the Lake House in a 1968 ? pickup truck.  Bits of snow are on the ground.<br /><br />Back in Chicago, Sandra reports to her new assignment as Dr. (Kate) Forster at Chicago City Hospital.  At a construction site, architect Keanu (Alex) tells us that he has bought the Lake House.  As Alex moves in, he checks the mail box, finding a letter from Kate, as the former tenant, providing her new address and asking the "new owner" to forward her mail if he receives any of it. A scraggy dog soon shows up and runs into the Lake House.  We soon see the same scruffy dog with Kate.  (What is going on here?)<br /><br />Kate is back at the Lake House, retrieves a letter from Alex to her, from the mailbox.  He tells her the Lake House was empty for years and asks if she meant her letter for someone else.  She writes back, placing another letter for Alex in the Lake House mailbox and she just happens to mention that it is 2006.  Alex shows up at the address Kate gave him to hand-deliver a letter, but there is an empty lot, with luxury apartments scheduled to be built.  He returns home (to the Lake House) and drops the letter in the mailbox, telling her it is 2004.  She replies with a dated photo, telling him of a freak snowstorm from April 3, 2004 when everyone got sick.<br /><br />When the snow storm appears on that date, Alex's interest is obviously peaked.  They begin to correspond regularly, by dropping letters in the Lake House mailbox, although both do not understand how it is possible.  The dog's name is Jack, and both of Alex and Kate seem to share Jack.  It is very interesting to see the play of how things work around time in the movie as Alex and Kate fall in love from a distance.  A sub-plot is Alex and his brother's relationship with their grouchy, cold, unaffectionate father, played by veteran actor Christopher Plummer.<br /><br />Is this romance just an impossible fantasy?  Can time be bent, somehow, to cross the paths of two people who are two years apart?  Is there hope?  Is anything REALLY impossible; or is it just highly improbable (as my brother used to say)?<br /><br />Personally, I think ALL things are possible.</p></body></html>

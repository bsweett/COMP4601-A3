<meta name="summary" content="Needed a Makeover, but the stylist never finished."></head><body><p>'Clash of The Titans' was one of those movies that came out in the zany 80s. Like most of those movies they were fun to watch, but if you wanted them to be these great epics you had to turn to very crude special effects. With where we are right now in film making we can do almost anything from Dinosaurs, to transforming robots. So, naturally why not take some of these old honky-tonk 80s epics and turn them into something amazing?!<br /><br />Clash of the Titans was a good choice to give one of these modern day makeovers to. The epic battles with mythical Greek monsters in this day and age would look incredible...and they did. Still, the guys who gave this movie a makeover sort of forgot to finish the job. The movie was lacking extremely of acting talent, character development and story. Now I went to see this movie in the theaters because the action sequences looked great and yes they were. During the softer points in the movie I was flat out bored. The acting was bland, and even though Liam Neason and Ralph Finnes brought all they could to the table and they did a decent job, it still just didn't seem to work. Also the movie while it paced quite well, it just went a little too fast. I thought that the battles with the giant scorpions and Medusa just went way too quickly I completely didn't know there was a fight going on. Don't even get me started on the Kraken battle...I don't even know if there was a battle with the Kraken because I think the movie ended right when it finally showed up on the screen.<br /><br />A great deal of film appreciators feel that re-making films is a bad idea, I say yes and no, because let's face it do you really think that a kid born after 1990 is going to ask his/her mom or dad to rent the 1981 'Clash of the Titans'? Odds are no, so why not bring some of these movies to the modern day, clean them up add some great effects and there you have it. Still, when you decide that this is a movie you want to re-do make you actually make it better than the original! Not the same and definitely not worse. 'Clash of Titans' is nothing but an epic of failure. Still, I am glad that I did see it and I am glad that the things I expected in the film to be good were and that's why I gave it 2 stars.<br /><br />Oh on a personal note, supposedly there is a re-make of 'The NeverEnding Story' in the works....GET GUERLLMO DelTORO ON THE PHONE....PLEASE!!!</p></body></html>

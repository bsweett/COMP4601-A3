When I finally viewed it, I felt cheated.  Not only was "Sum of All Fears" boring, it was also completely lacking of sincerity and depth.  After the bombing of the sports arena and the surrounding areas of Baltimore, the movie seemed to disregard the monumental tragedy, and trivialize it.  Of course the President's life was spared while all others had to perish.  Nothing was mentioned on any news footage about the attack, nor did they show the devasting effects of a bomb leveling a major stadium and how it destroyed an entire city, because the movie was too busy making Ben Affleck sooperhero!....to the rescue!!!!! Woohoo!.......I thought "The Sum Of All Fears" was going to be more of a commentary on terrorism and how this kind of tradegy would affect our community and culture, but it turned out to be an action vehicle for Ben Affleck.  And by the way, his girlfriend nurse at the hospital would have died in real life, they even showed her being blown away in one scene, but somehow, he meets up with her later, and she has a little scratch on her head....yeah right!!!!!</p></body></html>

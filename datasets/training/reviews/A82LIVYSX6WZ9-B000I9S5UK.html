<meta name="summary" content="the remake of John Carpenters classic"></head><body><p>Ethan Hawke (Before Sunset, Taking Lives) stars as cop Reddick or Rundick (one of the names) and he is spending his New Years at Precinct 13 which is gonna be shut down. Brian Dennehy (Tommy Boy) plays Jasper and Drea DeMatteo (Tv's Joey, Tv's The Sopranos) plays the hot secretary. These 3 get a surprise when two guards, Dorian Harewood (Sudden Death) and Kim Coates (Open Range, Waterworld), bring a bus load of criminals to their precinct for the night. The criminals are played by Ja Rule (Half Past Dead, The Fast and The Furious) and John Leguizamo (Romeo & Juliet, The Pest). Laurence Fishburne portraits gang leader Bishop who was caught in a shootout in a church. What the people inside dont know is that their are people on the outside trying to get in and kill them all because Fishburne has to testify at a case because he killed a cop but the real reason is, is that supposed good cop Marcus, played by Gabriel Byrne (Stigmata, The Usual Suspects) was partners with Fishburne but Byrne wants him dead so he wont rat on them and good hard working cops dont go to jail. A lively cast makes up for the rest of it...a solid beginning with Hawke doing his drug dealer speech and then it builds up into some nonsense but the action pays up and its cool to see Fishburne, Dennehy, Hawke and Byrne duke it out with each other. Leguizamo has his moments and Ja Rule is in a better role this time though he isnt impressive. Also starring Maria Bello (Tv's ER, Coyote Ugly) and Matt Craven (Crimson Tide, Masterminds). this remake of John Carpenter's classic isnt the best. It runs out of steam after the beginning but it picks up towards the end. More like 2 1/2 stars then 3.</p></body></html>

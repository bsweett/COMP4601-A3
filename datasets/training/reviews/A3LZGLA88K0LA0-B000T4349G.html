As I watched the first half of the movie, there were some compelling sequences and a couple of generally frightening scenes.  Julianne Moore and Dominic West were doing a great job in involving me in their plight.  One could sense sinister underpinnings from Anthony Edwards as Moore's husband and Gary Sinise as her psychiatrist.  Then, halfway through, the movie takes a strange turn and once you realize where it's taken you, you feel cheated.  It has one of the most anti-climactic and outright dull endings in recent movie history.  Even the alternate ending included on the DVD doesn't make up for the movie's lack of commitment to the viewer.  Who is doing this?  We are never really told.  Why are they doing this?  We are never really told.  And by the end of the movie, where are we timewise?  Before or after the fateful plane crash scenario?  It's a shame because it could have been a much better movie had the writer and director respected its audience a little more.  Writing a plot that is so open-ended and where everything is left to the viewer's own interpretation does not spell good moviemaking to this viewer.</p></body></html>

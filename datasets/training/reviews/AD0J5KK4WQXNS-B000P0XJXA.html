Scott (Val Kilmer) is a marine who doesn't wince at taking out a man's eye for not spilling the beans. As usual David Mamet's direction and screenplay leave the viewer's head spinning after the first three minutes with questions like, "how come a marine is shooting up the local police force?" Many tough as nails moments force the viewer to confront these cold case facts of a military underbelly that needs the guts to get the job done at any cost, especially when the President's daughter (implied as the President's daughter but never officially stated by the movie) has been kidnapped by a Middle Eastern prostitution ring that does not know what it has done. Queue various international espionage scenes including some cinematography work in Dubai and mix it with homeland security conspiracy and you have got yourself a drama that plants itself right on in there along side classics like "Marathon Man" and "3 Days of the Condor" and is not a distant cry from Clancy movies like "Clear and Present Danger".<br /><br />As a special ops squad leader, Scott does not plan missions; he executes them, with an iron fist conviction that expects complete obedience from his subordinates. In one scene he takes an old age pensioner madam and places her in a chokehold to get the information out of her. Knowing that the girl will be killed when the abductors figure out what they have, it is a race against the clock. Scott dawns a detective mind that is not afraid to whip out a blade when the going gets tough. A double cross sees Scott eventually planning his own mission in order to do the right thing. There is plenty of thinking, plot twists and characters to make it deeper than most thrillers, with still lots to do. This is ace entertainment through and through. If you like any of the movies mentioned in this review and know who Mamet is and appreciate Kilmer in comeback mode - then what are you waiting for? This could well be one of the best DVDs you could hook up with in 2005. It is certainly the best post 911 thriller that does a good spin on homeland security. Check it out.</p></body></html>

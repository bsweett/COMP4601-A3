Always in movies like these there is gonna be a scientist whose gonna give some sort of speech about the world being in peril and the government laughs at him saying " oh it isnt gonna happen" and then the next minute you know that guy is being impaled by a bus. This movie has different parts of the world being plunged into the end of the world and one city is New York where there is trapped son of Dennis Quaid (Frequency, upcoming Flight Of The Pheonix), Jake Gyllenhaal (Highway, October Sky) and soon after Quaid talks to his son about whats going on, he and 2 other guys, Dash Mihok (Dark Blue, The Thin Red Line) and Jay O. Sanders (Kiss The Girls, Daylight) rush out to go and save his son and the people trapped inside the library. Meanwhile, Gyllenhaal is trying to survive with the others till his dad comes. A movie like this should of been way more better and way more, just, awesome. Only some of the disaster scenes (examples being tidal wave scene, city being frozen scenes and the flock of birds scene) are pretty cool but Dennis Quaid cant quite save this, only Gyllenhaal rises above material. It would be scary to think this would happen in real life but on the big screen it isnt that scary or interesting. Glenn Plummer (Speed, The Salton Sea) is wasted playing a homeless man and Ian Holm (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, The 5th Element) as an old scientist. Also starring Emmy Russum (Mystic River, The Phantom Of The Opera), Sela Ward (The Fugitive), Nestor Serrano (Bringing Out The Dead, The Negotiator), Adrian Lester (Primary Colors), Austin Nichols and Arjay Smith. In other words folks this supposed thrilling fast paced ride is a frozen icicle of boredom</p></body></html>

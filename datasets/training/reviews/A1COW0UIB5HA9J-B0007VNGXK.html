<meta name="summary" content="Awesome Comic Book based movie."></head><body><p>In 1944, the Nazis and German scientists with the aid of legendary Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden) are conducting experiments in black magic. They have created a special dimensional portal machine that can summon a powerful demon god from another dimension to bring armageddon to the world but it failed. Paranormalist Professor Trevor Broom Brutterholm (John Hurt) and a band of soldiers discover a harmless baby devil-like demon with short non-sharp horns from hell as they raise him to be an avenging creature that defends people and destroys evil nicknamed Hellboy (Ron Perlman). Sixty years later, Rasputin has been resurrection as now he joins forces with zombie-like nazi soldier Kroenen (Ladislav Beran) and sexy Illsa (Biddy Hodson) as they must attempt to try to bring the demon god to create the apocalypse. Now it's up to Professor Broom's Beauru for Paranormal Research squad lead by Hellboy with the help of kind hearted, intelligent and telepathic merman named Abe Sapien (Voiced by David Hyde Pierce and played by Doug Jones) and gorgeous pyrokinetic woman Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) as they face off some deadly demons and try to save the world.<br /><br />Superb horror comedy fantasy adventure from the brilliant Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro ("Blade II", "Pan's Labyrinth" and "Cronos") and based on the popular cult Dark Horse comic "Hellboy" by Mike Mignola who was one of the producers of this movie. It's faithfully adapts the brilliant comic book to life thanks to the director's vision, Ron Perlman was born to play the title hero and just fits the bill the right way! Hellboy's make-up was created by Rick Baker ("An American Werewolf in London") and the creature effects especially on Abe Sapien are fantastic. The film co-stars Jeffrey Tambor, Rupert Evans and Brian Steele as the entire cast gives out wonderful performances and there's good action sequences. I love how the film has a mix of fantasy with H.P. Lovecraft-esque themes to it and of course some good timed humor mixed in, this is one of the greatest comic book movies in recent memory and a true must see! i can't wait for the sequel this summer.<br /><br />This 3-Disc DVD contains the unrated director's cut with never before seen footage not shown in the theatrical cut with hours of awesome extras.

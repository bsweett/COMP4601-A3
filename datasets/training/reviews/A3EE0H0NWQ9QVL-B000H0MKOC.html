As a smoking lobbyist, he must put a good face on the hated and waning tobacco market.  He is savvy and smart, making appearances on news interviews and daytime talk shows.  He creates spin in the cleverest ways.  (For instance, he must address a panel on "The Joan Lunden Show" and face an-ex smoker, a child who is dying from cancer.  He says that they don't want people to die of cancer because they would lose their customers, and he only recommends cigarettes when they are grown up.)  He must lobby "to pay the mortgage," but he also must keep his son's respect.  Eventually, like many others, his son is caught up in the spin of his father's saviness.  He learns to become as persuasive as his father. Yet, for Nick, persuasion is still a challenge: He must stand up to a back-stabbing boss and his two partners in crime, one (Maria Bello) the alcohol advocate, and one for firearms.  Although his biggest nemesis is the senator of Vermont (William Macy), a pompous politician whose attempts to squash Naylor seem futile.  His second biggest contender is a beautiful reporter who exposes him when he is oddly vulnerable.<br /><br />Based on a Christopher Buckley novel, "Thank You for Smoking" is a satire that hits the right delivery.  It is not subtle, but it doesn't really become self-righteous.  The movie is funny, yet obvious, without beating the viewer over the head.  Sometimes the tension of the plot wains, but it is seldom unengaging.  The performances are good--especially Aaron Eckhart as the smooth, conniving Naylor.  It should be said that the previews are excellent, but they do give away too many of the punchlines.  (For those who are uninitiated, plug your ears if they start to show this film before you see it.)  For others who are sensitive, there is a great deal of profanity and a sex scene (which does make a point, by the way) that may deter some away.  Overall, it is a solid comedy with fine portrayals and enough punches to go around (politics, entertainment, and the tobacco industry).</p></body></html>

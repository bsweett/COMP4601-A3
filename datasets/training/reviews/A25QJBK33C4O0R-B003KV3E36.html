<meta name="summary" content="Rambo lives on, his opponents not so much..."></head><body><p>It has been many years, and apparently nearly as many pounds, since Sylvester Stallone made a Rambo movie, but apparently the extra weight and time away from the role just made Stallone hungrier to earn a pay-day from the character he previously played.<br /><br />Rambo, the title of the 4th film in the John Rambo story, finds Rambo running a boat through the jungles near Burma which seems to be very convenient as there is a war going on there with rebels being rounded up and killed genocide style.  Even as those events are going on, John Rambo is apparently somewhat content to round up snakes and do his own blacksmithing, at least until a god squad of Doctors and missionaries comes to hire him to take them to where the action has been so they can help the victims there.<br /><br />Of course in Rambo's world help would mean changing the situation and change isn't possible if you aren't helping to even the fight between the rebels and the cruel and sadistic military that is abusing them.  Rambo asks the leader of the group if they'll be bringing weapons which is met by a 'we don't support violence' type answer that he follows with a tart 'then you aren't changing anything'.<br /><br />Eventually Rambo is convinced to take the group where they wish to go though the motivation for his doing so is an issue that isn't really resolved in the cut of the film that is on the disc.  In fact there are a few places where the film does a poor job of fleshing out why some things are happening and just what the relationship is between some of the characters, all of which actually seem much better resolved and more detailed in the handful of deleted scenes which are on the disc but weren't included in the movie as released.  Of the scenes on the disc at least 2 or 3 should have gone in as filmed, though in one scene there were obvious sound issues that cause the dialog to be garbled and nearly lost (perhaps explaining why the scene was cut).  Considering the films fairly short running time (just over 90 minutes), including the extra footage probably would have made for a better film.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me looking at Stallone carrying the extra pounds (even as I could point back at my own expanding mid-section) while wearing long hair and trying to portray an "I've lost interest in the world" type attitude just didn't work as well as I would have hoped.  Yes the movie is filled with plenty of action, plenty of blood and guts (and gore), and a message that deals with when there is or isn't a time for violence or peaceful approach to resolving problems, but having seen the film I'm left thinking an overweight Sly Stallone in the role of action hero isn't a good thing.  It may as well have been George Foreman (carrying a bunch of his grills) on the screen running through the jungle, as that would have been equally as believable really.<br /><br />This isn't a bad film, and the story is worth discussion, but I don't think it was the best in the Rambo series either.  Compared to the earlier films the story may be better, but the passage of time is obvious to the viewer and that doesn't help the illusion that should exist in the film world.  Plenty of violence, plenty of shooting and killing, lots of blood spurting.  Be aware going into viewing that the film is fairly graphic.  Solid 3 to 3.5 stars.</p></body></html>

It is also fair to describe the famous screen artist as a stereotypical useful idiot.  His production of The Motorcycle Diaries is a leftist whitewash of a very evil man, Ernesto "Che" Guevara.  The enslavement of Cuba is greatly due to his efforts.  In the final years of this monster's relatively short life, Fidel Castro's close friend and comrade murdered people without hesitation.  Sometimes for next to nothing. When in doubt, Guevara felt it was better to put a bullet into the head of a perceived enemy of the revolution.  Was he always such a despicable creature?  The short answer: no.  According to this film, Che was once an idealist who valued truth and interacted with other human beings in a very generous manner.  There seems to be little evidence to suggest in 1952 that he would ever turn into a blood thirsty Marxist ideologue.  On the contrary, one might have more readily predicted Che would invent a cure for leprosy.<br /><br />We observe Ernesto Guevara traveling through South America with his buddy Alberto Granado.  They have more time than money.  This is suppose to be their voyage of discovery before returning to the serious duties of earning a good income and fulfilling their career ambitions.  There are hints of their left-wing political leanings, but for the most part they seem like wild and crazy guys seeking adventure and a good time.  The Motorcycle Diaries fails to deliver.  I want to know what happened to Che immediately after his trip.  Who did he meet that pushed him over the edge?  What finally enticed Guevara to become a political extremist?  These questions are left unanswered.<br /><br />David Thomson<br /><br />Flares into Darkness</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Heroism or Humanism?"></head><body><p>Everybody's seen it. There are 650 reviews already. I don't need to recount the plot, do I?<br /><br />My take on this film is colored by my years of visiting and living in Spain, from the first time in 1965 until spring of 2007. The content of a film is what the viewer thinks when she/he watches it. I thought of Franco and of Franco's special church-haunted fascism. Does Franco rhyme with macho? Close enough. Franquismo was about masculine honor, including the very masculine honor of God the Father as conceived by the Franquistas. I carry a fairly passionate hatred for Franquismo in my conscience, as passionate as that of most Spaniards today. That emotion certainly colored my experience of Pan's Labyrinth.<br /><br />It's a film about the cost of heroism in terms of humanism. The two women characters are heroic in their loyalties and in their acceptance of suffering. The Communist guerillas are heroic in their stubborn and futile resistance to tyranny and brutality, but they are mere stock figures, scarcely individuals, scarcely at risk of self-doubt, mor eprops than characters. The doctor is a reluctant but unwavering hero, but he's a minor character. That leaves the girl Ofelia and the sadistic beast of fascist officer, Captain Vidal. The girl fantasizes heroism, and her fantasy is a story of its own. But the Captain is a flesh-and-blood human, the very worst exemplar of humanity at its most inhumane. Sergi Lopez is the star of this film, in my eyes, the masterfully acted embodiment of fascism in all its hatefulness. His concept of heroic honor, of the "real man's" heroic death, is the backdrop for every other character's actions, including the girl's fantasies. You out there in the audience? You want to understand fascism? Study Captain Vidal.</p></body></html>

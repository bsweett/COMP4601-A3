<meta name="summary" content="Not so secret "Window""></head><body><p>"Secret Window"<br />Release Date: March 12, 2004<br />DVD Release Date: June 22, 2004<br />Genre: Thriller<br />Studio: Columbia/Tri-Star Pictures<p>Directed by: David Koepp<br />Starring: Johnny Depp, John Tuturro, Maria Bello, and Charles Dutton<p>Based Upon the novella "Secret Window, Secret Garden" by Stephen King.<p>MPAA Rating: PG-13 (for violence/terror, sexual content and language)<p>Rating: C+<p>The Story:<br />Author Mort Rainey (Depp) is going through many problems in his life. He is in the middle of an ugly divorce with his wife (Bello) and he has terrible writer's block. So he goes to live in the middle of the woods in his cabin...alone...to try and write. Not with the arrival of John Shooter (Tuturro) claiming that Rainey had stolen his story, Mort's life slowly slides out of control.<p>The movie is based upon the Stephen King short story "Secret Window, Secret Garden" in his "Four Past Midnight" collection and does at times have the feel of a Stephen King novel throughout the movie. With a PG-13, the blood and gore level is not as high as some of King's other movie adaptations ("Dreamcatcher", "It", "The Shining") but there is not a lot of suspense and I called the twist 40 minutes in.<p>What Worked?<br />Well, the cast is great! Depp, Tuturro, Bello, and Dutton are all great actors and give the best performances they can. Like always, Johnny Depp ("Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl", "The Ninth Gate") is amazing and entertains. He really saves the movie. John Tuturro ("Mr. Deeds", "O, Brother Where Art Thou?") gave a creepy but not that menacing performance was John Shooter. Maria Bello ("Coyote Ugly", "The Cooler") gave an emotionally driven performance as Depp's soon to be ex-wife. And Charles Dutton ("Against the Ropes", "Gothika") was good as well. The cast is the high point of the film.<p>Next I loved the scenery and the music. Since the movie was not all that scary the creepy wilderness scenery and the great score by Phillip Glass ("Taking Lives", "The Hours") really made the movie a little scarier.<p>What didn't work?<br />Well... the movie was extremely predictable! I called the twist not even an hour into the movie! I was very disappointed that I was right! The way the movie looked from the trailer was a suspense filled thrill ride with action and plenty of scares. It was scary until Shooter kept showing up and making threats and then would not do anything! There could have been some freaky chase through the woods, lurking in the shadows type scenes...but there was noting like that. Shooter never jumped out of nowhere or anything, when he showed up he would just talk to Depp character!? <p>The worst part of the movie was the ending! Like I said anyone who likes murder mysteries, horror, thriller movies will be somewhat disappointed because if you know how to watch then correctly you can call this movie from a mile away! So this is a not so "secret" movie in the end. I am not going to tell you the ending because people will get mad. <p>Bottom Line:<br />I think this would be an entertaining movie to fans of Depp or anyone in the cast. Teens will flock to see this for a good scare but I recommend renting the DVD because its not that great of a movie.</p></body></html>

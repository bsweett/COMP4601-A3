<meta name="summary" content="Colin Farrell?"></head><body><p>"Alexander" has two major problems. The first is the fact that it is a two hour movie that they decided to extend. And they extended it, and they extended it, and they extended it, to the tedious three hour lenght that it is now. Why was it so long? Because director Oliver Stone had the urge to make every scene ten minutes long, and have Alexander the Great make his before battle speeches last for six or seven minutes. The second mjor problem with the movie was the casting. Angelina Jolie was actually the best part of the movie, and she is usually the worst. I hate Colin Farrell, and found him awful in "Minority Report," and "A Home at the End of the World," which is one of the worst movies of the year. He has no skill, and even though he is always playing a different character, he seems to act exactly the same. There's a scene in "Alexander" where he is riding his horse, and he should have a serious look on his face, but looks like he is about to break into the smile. Maybe the cameraman was making a funny face, but we will never know. Anthony Hopkins was useless, and he was the man telling the story to a scribe so he could put it into history. That was something that led to the extending minutes, and all the scenes that he was in was long speeches. That's how the movie starts as well, with a long speech that made me wonder when the movie would end.<br /><br />Alexander was born to King Philip II, and his mother is Olympias, who collects snakes, and always seems to have one around her neck. he is educated so that he is destined for being great, and his mother knows that he will one day be something special. Years later, one his parents are divorced, his mother wants him to marry a women that would ensure his place on the throne. His father is assassinated, and Alexander becomes the king. The only person that Alexander loves in his friend Hephaistion, but he still finds it neccessary to get a queen, so he marries Roxane, for hopes of having a son. As he goes on his quest, he wants to conquer the nations of Macedonia and eastern Asia. They go farthur east, men die in battle, and Alexander wants to be with Hephaistion. His mother continues to tell him that he is the "only Alexander of his kind. He is an Alexander the Great." Alexander continues to question his choices, and eventually he just becomes confused in his mind and his heart.<br /><br />The other historical epic that came out this year was "Troy" and the difference between "Alexander" and "Troy" is that "Troy" has a much better story. It is the story of a ten year war with ten thousand ships. "Alexander" is in the wake of "Troy," and even Achilles is mentioned many times. At least Colin Farrell was better than Brad Pitt was, but he wouldn't have been my first choice for Alexander. There were two major battle scenes in the movie, the first being following by a seven minute motivation speech, and the second involving elephants in Africa. The second is much more exciting, but the two battle scenes are too long. There is alot of blood, and like a French movie "A Very Long Engagement," I wish they could show battle scenes without that much blood. It is more realistic, but it sometimes is gratioutious, and could even be pointless. "Alexander" is not one of the worst movies of the year, but it's not one of the best. It is entertaining, but extended to the point where you want it to end. I didn't bring my watch to the theatre so I wouldn't look at it from time to time, but I did think about it sometimes. "Troy" was a better movie, visually and written much better. I was never bored during it, but "Alexander" had more useless scenes, even though the two movies are pretty much the exact same lenght. It's a shame that this couldn't have been better, because this had potential. Historical epics are great sometimes, and as "The Lord of the Rings" proved, a three hour movie isn't always suffered by its lenght.<br /><br />What I did like about the movie were the visuals. I gave "Vanity Fair" five stars, mostly because of the visuals, but the acting was also good in that movie, something that "Alexander" suffered from. This was a great movie to look at, and the last hour was also very exciting. From the last time Alexander saw his mother to the end, I loved the movie, and I wished that the rest could have been up to par with that. The music was good for the most part, even though historical epics all seem to have the same kind of music. I've heard battle music more times than I could count. I've never seen any other Oliver Stone movies, but I heard that alot were better than this, especially "JFK." The reason I liked "Troy" a lot better was because that was legend instead of mostly historical fact. The only things I remembered that were true with Alexander the Great was that he was a conquerer, he died of a fever, and he was a homosexual. This movie does use his homosexuality, but it doesn't use it againist him, or make it wrong to be it. "Alexander" would have been better as two hours, and with a different lead.<br /><br />ENJOY!<br /><br />Rated R for violence and some sexuality/nudity.</p></body></html>

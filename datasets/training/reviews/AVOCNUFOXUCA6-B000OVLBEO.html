<meta name="summary" content="Pointless mess"></head><body><p>Ultimately, "Ghost Rider" neither succeeds as a good movie or an entertaining bad movie.  The pacing is awful, and the story nonexistent.  What kind of movie wastes the gonzo talents of both Nicholas Cage and Peter Fonda?  This one.  What kind of movie wastes the comic genius of Donal Logue?  This one.  A great cast is squandered in a morass of senseless story.  "Ghost Rider" is badly written and badly directed.  If you must watch this, rent and don't buy.  And be prepared to nap in the middle.</p></body></html>

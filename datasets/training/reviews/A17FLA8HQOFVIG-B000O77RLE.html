<meta name="summary" content="Japanese perspective of this decisive battle blows away all stereotypes.  A masterpiece!"></head><body><p>This film blows away all the stereotypes that Americans have been fed over the last half-century about the Japanese.  Yes, Clint Eastwood is an American director.  But the film "feels" Japanese, and it's not only because, with the exception of just a scene or two, it is entirely in the Japanese language.  It's because the Japanese deeply-held tradition of dying with honor is so clearly depicted, so much so that it was easy for me to understand and identify where they were coming from.<br /><br />The film opens in the present day, as a cache of letters is discovered and carefully dug up.  I understand that some of these letters really do exist and had been published recently in Japan.  These letters form the narrative structure of the film.  It works very well.<br /><br />The rest of the film takes place in 1944, and  here we get to meet a full spectrum of Japanese soldiers.  We identify with them.  We feel their suffering as they all realize that this is truly their last stand and that are all going to die.  There is hunger, there is fear, there is discipline.  And, most clearly, there are their individual reactions to what is going on around them.  Ken Watanabe is cast as the General.  Kazara Ninomiya is cast as a young soldier who yearns to return to his wife and baby daughter.  And then there are all the other men -- the officer who was once an Olympic equestrian and had visited America, the young man who was sent to the front because he was too softhearted to be in an elite troop, and all of those who chose suicide missions or death by their own hands over surrender.  It is a huge and sad story.  I am glad it has been finally told in its entirety.<br /><br />The battle of Iwo Jima was a decisive one.  The Americans sent 100,000 men to rout out the Japanese soldiers who saw Iwo Jima as a part of Japan and were defending the Island.  Seven thousand Americans died, 20,000 were wounded.  And of the 20,000 Japanese defending the Island, only about 1,000 of them survived. The film seems to be shot in black and white and so, in a way, it seems like a film that might have been made during those early war days.  However, this is the year 2007 and graphic artists have mastered the techniques of working with colors.  And so, the color saturation varies scene by scene.  Some of the scenes inside the caves seem to have a warm red glow.  And during the battle scenes, the flames erupt in bright yellows and orange.  Other times, the faces of the men are in shadow or half shadow.  All of this certainly enhanced the realism and the mood.<br /><br />"Letters from Iwo Jima" is a masterpiece.  And yet, it is not for everybody.  The subtitles alone might dissuade some.  And inevitable sad ending will keep others away.  But students of history and human nature will applaud the genius of it all.  And a story that needed to be told is now available for world-wide audiences.</p></body></html>

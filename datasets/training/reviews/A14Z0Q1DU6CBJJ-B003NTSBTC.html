I wasn't scared, although I was completely compelled from top to bottom. Thank the lord that great Directors like Martin Scorsese are still around who prove that you don't have to do 'popcorn movie' stuff to keep audiences rivoted. You can capture an audience with perfectly timed scenes and haunting sounds of a lonely and secluded Shutter Island, home for hundreds of the criminally insane... or just with a great and subtle performance from a really good actor.<br /><br />When you think of Martin Scorsese, you think of Goodfellas, Casino, Taxi Driver & Raging Bull. With SHUTTER ISLAND, you forget about who made the movie, and that's a good thing. You get sucked in, you don't have expectations. From the quiet opening scene where you hear the horn of the fishing boat approaching the Island as the waves hit the side of the boat to the crippling finale, Scorsese paints a beautiful picture.<br /><br />SHUTTER ISLAND isn't gonna get the accolades that some of Scorsese's film have, but to be perfectly honest, it should have been nominated for best picture this year. DiCaprio should have been nominated. Scorsese, in my mind, proved this year that he's above and beyond the working directors today. He's still an artist. While everybody else is answering to their studios to apease the BLOW IT UP & NOBODY CARES ABOUT EMOTIONS crowd, Scorsese is still the great artist that he's always been.<br /><br />SHUTTER ISLAND is another great addition to Scorsese's long list of brilliant films.</p></body></html>

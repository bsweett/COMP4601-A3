<meta name="summary" content="Miss Short must be rolling in her grave over this one."></head><body><p>First off let me say I have never thought Mr. De Palma was that great a director. He has made some good films(Carrie, the Untouchables, and even Mission Impossible), but for the most part he seems to borrow (read steal) shots and ideas from Alfred Hitchcock(at least he steals from the best) and also likes to have a fluid moving camera to cover his lack of originality. Even with my feelings on him I felt he might be able to pull this compelling true murder case off and make it interesting. WRONG!!!!!!<br />  The film is lazy film making, he even allows the camera to just sit there for long stretches of time and builds absolutely no suspense to this tale. The actors seem to be trying hard but no one is able to raise above the weak and meandering script. The only one who turns in a great performance is the young woman playing the "Dahlia".  Seen in flashbacks and some sordid films, she brings more life to this movie than the others combined.<br />  I know this is based on a novel, but the thing i find the most unforgivable is they way they use Miss Short's horrible death as the foundation for the movie and then trash the poor woman's name by painting her out as a borderline Hooker/stag film star. Nowhere in the real facts was that ever found and in fact the true facts seem to be of little importance to the film makers. Miss Short died in a most gruesome way, why should she have her name pulled through the mud after the fact. This more than any of the other reasons is why I find the movie to be an insult to her, her family, and finally us. Look up the real tale and enlighten yourself about the case and see how they have done a disservice to her.<br />  I also find it iresponsable that they chose to "solve" this unsolved case, which is what Hollywood does best, Watch the film "The Zodiac(2007)" and see how a story about and unsolved crime can and should be handled.<br />  Once again Holly2wood rewrites history for it's own gain and lets a young woman, who may have been less than a saint, be turned into a "stag film" star instead of the real person she was.<br />  NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A GOOD MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!<br />  If you like it, well I'm happy for you and guess you will hate this review,, but this is how the movie came across to me.</p></body></html>

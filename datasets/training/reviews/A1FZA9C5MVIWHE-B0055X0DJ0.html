<meta name="summary" content="excellent movie"></head><body><p>this movie was fantastic. there was a ton of action. the desert fighting reminded me of the 1st Transformers movie. Megan Fox reprised her role as Mikaela Banes, Sam Witwicky's love interest. there was some funny moments in the movie. the two compact Autobots cracked me up, and when Judy Witwicky was eating hash brownies and revealed to the female co-ed students that Sam was no longer a virgin, and when Bumblebee fought back against the kitchen appliances that came to life when the shard came near them. this was an excellent summer movie and I hope Transformers 3 is good too. if you didn't like this movie there is something wrong with you. I recommend this movie to those that are kids at heart. there is a couple of moments where cuss words are uttered, but this is an awesome movie.</p></body></html>

When Vendetta came out, critics stomped it with criticism; they said the film had a shoddy conclusion and the decisions made by the protagonist were bought under scrutiny. There is no such protagonist in Children Of Men yet it is similar. Britain is a power in this movie again but then one might ask, what's the use when there is such a sense of uneasiness going on - around the world? Clive Own earns a lot of respect. His act is solid. There is no doubt that the action scenes in this film will make you wonder what hit you. To some, this film might appear  a bit "over the top" and to some, it might make perfectly skewed sense. CHILDREN OF MEN has a scene that stops your breath and makes your eyes go wide when your mind is telling you, "That's impossible" but yes, that where it sets itself apart.<br /><br />The best scenes in the film involves cars,on foot chases, men on the verge of insanity and utter dismay at one's helplessness. The direction tells us that power is ultimately sought. While Vendetta was based on a totalitarian form of government, Children Of Men takes a more conservative yet forward approach. Countries are fighting among themselves wondering why a woman can't give birth anymore. The storyline is good but the action and overall impact is quite staggering,really. The music of the film is worth remembering though not all tracks are found in the soundtrack. Why 4 stars, you might ask. I thought the film could have been longer (perhaps the editing could have been more generous) and I had difficulty understanding what was being said by a few characters.<br /><br />This is as good as Vendetta was, in my opinion, if not better. In ways best left home, it is also better than Vendetta whilst being a tad similar to 28 days later form of "run for your life"<br /><br />Give this film a chance, it will definitely leave an impact.</p></body></html>

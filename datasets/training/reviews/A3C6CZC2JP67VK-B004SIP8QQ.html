Everywhere I thought this movie was going to go....it didn't. Granted there are violent scenes, revenge filled rampaging fights and plenty of edge of your seat action. What I didn't expect was a lot of comedy. The actors never played anything for a laugh and I believe that's why it translated so well. The black and white cinematography ranks up there with some of the best ever, plus the camera movement was unreal. They used plenty of really neat pan shots. They always had the camera moving at very pleasing angles that went hand in hand with the telling of the story and at times the unfolding of the story as when the camera balances out other people or objects come into frame.<br /><br />The fight between Elle Driver and The Bride is one of the most memorable fight scenes ever, if not the best. Just really original concepts provided by the Yuen Wo Ping Fight Team who deserve some sort of award for their helping revive a rebirth in the genre let alone spawning movies such as the Matrix etc. Also deserving praise is Uma Thurman who easily gave her best performance to date. Wow is all that can be said. She was funny, vulnerable and [great action packed] all at the same time. I really see this as a female empowerment film.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino delivers an astonishing film. It's obvious he loves this genre way more then the hardcore addicts it's so welcome in today's film industry where producers call the shots. You can tell this series is his baby. This is a definitely a must have especially if you loved the first one.</p></body></html>

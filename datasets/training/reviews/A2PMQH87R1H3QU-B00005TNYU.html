<meta name="summary" content="BACK TO MY CHILDHOOD!!! AHHhh... MEMORIES.."></head><body><p>Every generation has certain movies that will always transport them back to childhood. "The Goonies" does that for alot of people in my generation. The cool thing about this flick is, not only does it take you back, but, once there, it captures so wonderfully what the best moments of being a kid felt like. Yes, the plot is mostly a fantasy-the ultimate wish fulfillment of having a great adventure, and saving the day. However, the soul of the movie-why it's still cherished today-is it's understanding of friendship and family. "Stand By Me" is the only other film that has so accurate a portrait of adolescent boys interacting with each other. The cast had such an amazing chemistry. Great direction by Richard Donner, and this is Spielberg magic in it's prime. This fantastic DVD presentation does the film justice. Some may think this movie is way too 80's, but to me "The Goonies" is an essential classic.</p></body></html>

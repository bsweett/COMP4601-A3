<meta name="summary" content="About as perfect a movie as you're likely to see!"></head><body><p>This is such a wonderful, joyous, uplifting movie! Normally one wouldn't say that about a film centering around teen pregnancy, a failed marriage and broken hearts, but in his case? Yeah!<br /><br />"Juno" for those of you who have been living in caves, is a film about a young girl who, after a night's indiscretion with her best friend, becomes pregnant. Initially planning to get an abortion, she changes her mind and decides to put the baby up for adoption. It goes from there.<br /><br />What I like about this movie is that all the characters are treated with respect, especially Juno's parents who, when she tells them her "good" news, don't respond with the sort of hysterics you'd normally see in a movie. No, they handle it like you'd imagine such people would; quiet disapointment, but slightly proud of her for handling it as an adult.<br /><br />The writing is sharp, though a little twee for the first twenty minutes or so. Then it settles down into a nice, intelligent screenplay that doesn't talk down to the audience. All the plot twists seem earned, and all the emotions seem real.<br /><br />The acting all around is great, particularly Ellen Page as the title character. She brings a real charm and charisma to the movie that would be absent with almost anyone else in the role.<br /><br />The movie isn't without flaws. Jason Bateman's character isn't handled as welll as I might like, but you know, otherwise, this movie has earned every single acolade and award it's received and then some. It's a really, really good movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A violent, thrilling, stylistic thrill ride"></head><body><p>The movie took place in Sin City, a city so corrupt and violent that a large section of the city was abandoned by the police  and was protected by scantily clad hookers. It was film noir at its finest. The movie consisted of several loosely connected vignettes. The heros were the following: an old, tough, but straight cop; an extremely ugly and extremely tough ex-con, with his own moral code; and a murderer on the lam, he had plastic surgery, but his sense of public duty led him into trouble. The villians were extremely evil and powerful, but there was a cosmic justice in this world, and the bad guys got a type of justice. The movie was extremely violent, but its surreal nature and its graphic novel type character buffered the viewer.<br /><br />The movie was a unique and fun experience.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A noble cinematic experience..."></head><body><p>Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), an ex-Army Captain, served in the Civil War and several battles against the Native Americans.  Years after the wars Nathan suffers from post-traumatic stress, which he struggles to smother with alcohol.  However, Nathan's past precedes him as his services are requested in Japan in order to squelch a rebellion by the few Samurai that holds on to the old traditions and who believe that the changes in Japan are moving too rapidly.  In Nathan's first battle with the enemy he is captured by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), the leader of the rebellion, who intends to study Nathan as he wants to learn more about his enemy.  This leads to a mutual respect and discovery of wisdom for both Nathan and Katsumoto as they both deepen their enlightenment of Bushido.  Nonetheless, the mutual understanding between the two warriors has set them on a path of righteousness and honor that has been challenged by the Japanese rule.  This means that the two men must live by the warrior code, which can mean certain death.  Last Samurai is a story that fuses Western values with Eastern values, but both value sets are still intact as they merge.  Zwick leaves the audience with a heroic tale about sacrifice, honor, friendship, love, and commitment that offers a noble cinematic experience.</p></body></html>

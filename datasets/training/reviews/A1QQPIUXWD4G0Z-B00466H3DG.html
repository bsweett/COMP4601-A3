A great film with creative cinematography and decent acting by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet.<br /><br />The plot line is too convoluted to explain in this review and to do so would spoil the story.  The story is however quite creative and explores some rather complex psychological/philosophical premises as to the function of memory and relationships.  Is the memory of a departed lover merely a nuisance to one's state of mind or is it a reminder about what our subconscious minds feel is best for us?  Can we truly erase memories or do they stay with us one way or another no matter what we do.  These are some of the themes the film seems to touch upon in its plot.<br /><br />This is an interesting film typical of Kaufmann's imagination found in other screenplays by him such as 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation.'  This is a fun film to watch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DREW IS UTTERLY ADORABLE."></head><body><p>This film has always been quite famous and i can understand why.Famous actors such as drew barrymore that played gertie and Director Steven spielberg a director of quite a lot of films. It is bought to life by a cute little alien E.T, 2 kids who befriended it and took him in to their home to keep. Little gertie is the last to find outabout him and literally screams at first. I think this film would be quite boring for some maybe because of the actors but i loved it.</p></body></html>

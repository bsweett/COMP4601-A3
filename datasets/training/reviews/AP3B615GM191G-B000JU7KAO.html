Night Predecessors"></head><body><p>When "Lady In The Water" first hit DVD/BluRay in December of 2006, I eagerly snatched it up in anticipation of M. Night Shyamalan's next masterpiece following "The Village".  After viewing it at that time, I thought it was one of the worst movies I had ever seen in my life.  Six years later, after watching the film again with a younger sibling, I finally was able to understand the overall concept and thoroughly enjoy the experience.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Lady In The Water" takes place in "The Cove", an apartment complex (complete with swimming pool) owned by Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti).  When a mermaid-like being named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) suddenly turns up in Heep's pool, an entirely new world (with completely new beings) is discovered, one that Story must get back to at all costs.<br /><br />If you try to compare "Lady in the Water" to M. Night's earlier fare, you will be severely disappointed.  This is not a "surprise ending" film, nor is it a psychological thriller.  Comparing it to movies like "Signs", "The Sixth Sense", "Unbreakable", & "The Village" is like comparing apples to oranges.  When I originally watched the film, I was expecting the past and missed what this movie really is all about.<br /><br />The real genius of this movie?  It is essentially a modern-day fairy tale.  Based on a bedtime story M. Night told his children that later took on epic proportions, Shyamalan adapted the story into a major motion picture.  As such, the story is incredibly original and quite fantastical, filled with imaginative characters and quirky real-life individuals.  This project is a labor of love for M. Night, and I respect him for making it and making it well.<br /><br />The only reason I can't give this film a full five stars is because some of the plot points do not exactly line up.  Yes, it is a fairy tale, but it is quite a bit fractured at that.  It contains nothing "worthy" of the multiple Razzy Awards it ended up winning, but a few points in the film are a bit confusing/nonsensical.<br /><br />Overall, upon second viewing (with a completely different frame of mind), "Lady In The Water" is inches shy of a truly classic film.  Once you understand WHY M. Night made the movie, you'll respect it in a completely different light.</p></body></html>

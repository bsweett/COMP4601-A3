This film doesn&#8217;t exactly succeed in doing so, but it does offer a few impressive set pieces as compensation. &#8220;What Lies Beneath&#8221; borrows heavily from movies like &#8220;Rebecca&#8221; and &#8220;Psycho,&#8221; adding generous helpings of &#8220;Rear Window&#8221; and &#8220;Wait Until Dark&#8221; to the mix for good measure. .... It does an effective job at the beginning when it is setting up the scenario, injecting just enough ambiguity into the proceedings to make us question whether Claire is truly seeing what she thinks she is seeing or whether she is suffering from delusions brought on by mental instability. Unfortunately, once that issue is decided for us, the film loses some of its intriguing quality and becomes a more standard issue horror film. Moreover, the major plot &#8220;twist&#8221; is one we can pretty much predict five minutes into the film. Given its weaknesses, &#8220;What Lies Beneath&#8221; delivers the goods for those who want nothing more than a relaxing, goosepimply good time at the movies. Director Robert Zemeckis, though he appears to be slumming here a bit, knows how to shoot an effective jump-out-of-your-seat suspense sequence &#8211; although he does tend to rely overmuch on the &#8220;false scare&#8221; technique that seems to be so popular in films of this type. As to the acting, Ford pretty much walks through his part, surely dreaming of better things to come in the role department, but Pfeiffer manages to bring a dignity and depth to a character that could easily have degenerated into the hysterical wife stereotype. &#8220;What Lies Beneath&#8221; is an effective time killer provided you realize beforehand that the answer to the film&#8217;s title is: &#8220;Not much.&#8221;</p></body></html>

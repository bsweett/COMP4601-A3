There were things about it I liked and things about it I disliked. Here is the lowdown on what I thought and why...<br /><br />What I liked: Stallone is in AWESOME shape and is an inspiration to people young and old. A healthy lifestyle pays off and here is your proof. He still has a great body. He still looks great shirtless even at 60 years old and I respect that a lot. It's not easy to stay in that kind of shape at any age. The acting, Stallone has matured as an actor and is a lot more natural and believable than in other movies. The cinematography was nice and really captured the essence of the first Rocky movie. The HBO PPV fight LOOKED like a real boxing match! The camera angles during the fight looked very authentic. Paulie was great, I loved his line about "People who skate on ice are stupid" (I am not a fan of the cold either) and I think he was a valuable and funny character in this movie. Paulie added some laughs in the somber beginning. The Champ, they picked a real boxer for the part of the rival and I think the authenticity really came through, he's not a bad actor and I hope to see him in other roles in the future. It's nice to see someone who is not just an athlete but has other talents too! He did a very good job of acting like the young, self-absorbed, arrogant champion. To see him interviewed in real life, he seems like a respectful, humble guy. I think this role was a good challange for him. He actually seemed to enjoy playing an ego-inflated star who everyone hates and I think it takes a lot of character for an otherwise nice guy to play such a role.<br /><br />What I disliked: The slow, sappy version of the famous "Rocky" music. I thought the music was a downer and really did not like hearing the formerly upbeat and inspirational theme song slowed down to the pace of a funeral dirge through most of the film! Yeah we get it, we are supposed to feel sad, depressed and it's meant to be nostalgic. It was overkill! The first half hour of the film is dedicated to showing how down in the dumps Rocky is, his wife is dead and he goes to all his old hangouts and there are too many flashbacks. The beginning dragged a lot and I almost fell asleep during the first 30 minutes. The son, a good actor who looked a lot like Stallone but the whole 'living in dad's big shadow' concept was cliche. I didn't like his character at all. I found it hard to believe that a 25-30 year old man would still have such an immature resentment of his dad. I was thinking "Dude, get over it, grow up and give your old man a break!" This attitude would have been more suited to the behavior of a teenager and not a grown man, though I did like Rocky's speech to his son about blaming people and making excuses. Way to go dad, I would have felt the same way if I had such a grumpy, ungrateful kid! I also thought it was unrealistic how the son suddenly was so supportive after being so distant for so long. It was painful to watch such a loving kind hearted dad being brushed off by his whiny, wimpy and disrespectful son! The girl Marie, they could have heated this part up just a little, it was too 'innocent' a relationship. Rocky's wife is dead, he's had a tough time, the guy deserves to hook up with a new lady and prove that he is indeed still the Italian Stallion! I would not have gone so far as a love scene but I found the one kissing scene was too 'vanilla' for my taste. I wasn't feeling any passion there. So, Rocky is not young anymore but he's not dead, geeze! The ending, ok so it was realistic but it was dissapointing, I much preffered the alternate ending on the DVD! I also could have done without the shot of Adrienne's grave, like we already SAW that 3 times during the film, why show it again and end a good movie on a sad note? We know she is gone, I want to see him move on with his life and stop wallowing in the past like he did for half the movie.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the movie but I didn't love it. Halfway through the film I was thinking "PLEASE lets get past the sappy parts and show him training, climbing stairs, drinking raw eggs and punching sides of beef!" I really liked how the other Rocky movies pumped me up and made me want to go work out. This movie did not have the degree of adrenaline that I would have wanted in an action-based Stallone movie.<br /><br />This movie showed a more human Rocky but it was so overdone it came off too sappy and slowed the pace of the film. There was a lot of emotion in the beginning but the end lacked emotion and fell flat. There was a big build up and it lacked a big ending to carry it. I wanted to see the tear-jerking ending where he triumphs over all odds after being beaten to a bloody pulp. The satisfaction simply wasn't there. It was a good ending to a great series but unfortunately I think this movie could have been better.<br /><br />The alternate ending on the DVD was stellar and would have been a much better choice than the original. If they had gone with the alternate ending I'd have given it 4 stars. If they had done that and cut down on the sap and sad music I'd have given it 5 stars. It was WAY better than Rocky 5 but that's not saying much because Rocky 5 was a one star movie as far as I was concerned. I am looking forward to the next Rambo movie and I hope it has a better ending than Rocky Balboa. I might watch this again one day but I think I will skip the ending and watch the alternate one instead!</p></body></html>

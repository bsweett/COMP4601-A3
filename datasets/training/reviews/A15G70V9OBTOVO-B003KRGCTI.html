<meta name="summary" content="Zero surprises but Denzel's always good."></head><body><p>Somebody drops the big one.  All that remains are rusty cars, broken freeway overpasses and matte paintings.  There are two groups of people, healthy and not so healthy and the usual assortment of bandits who look like the guy with the ammunition belts at the end of Raising Arizona.  The "twist", if you can call it that, is that the hero is carrying a book.  Now, in case you really cannot guess instantly what book it is, the title of the movie is "The Book Of..."  Still not sure?  Well, it turns out, the book guides Eli and shows him a path to follow.  So, is it (a) Playboy's Party Jokes, (b) How To Use Your Kenmore Washer or (c) the Bible?  I'm not going to give it away, sorry.<br /><br />Things plod along, and towards the end, Eli is forced to part with the book.  He reaches his destination without the book and then, you will never, never guess what happens, unless you saw Farenheidt 451, maybe 40 years ago.  So things really rest with Denzel, who as usual, is very good and how much you want to read into all this.  I suppose it could be very inspirational if you can avoid getting bogged down by having seen it all before.  Then again, maybe that's what the book is trying to say.  You may think you've invented something new but its all been done before.</p></body></html>

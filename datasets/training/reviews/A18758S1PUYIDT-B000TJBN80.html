<meta name="summary" content="Gore and silliness--rent it if you're into that."></head><body><p>There's gore galore, gallons of blood, lots of screaming and running, plenty of aerial shots, and an apocalyptic feel to this movie.  However, you can tell that the original director is not at the helm.  Also, much of the action is repetitious rather than necessary for the plot.  As well, the military does such stupid things that you cry out for a smart civilian (like a movie reviewer?) to give them some advice on what to do with these raging people and the innocent uninfected ones.<br />In a really stupid move, someone ends up spreading the disease to France by the end.  Dumb soldier!  Dumb! Dumb!<br />Too bad that the always-pleasing Robert Carlyle is compromised so soon.</p></body></html>

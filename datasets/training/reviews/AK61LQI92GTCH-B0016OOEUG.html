Gene Tierney is luminous as the title character (and she CAN act), Dana Andrews convincingly falls for a dead woman, and Clifton Webb threatens to steal the show as the brittle and acerbic newspaperman Waldo Lydecker.  Rounding out the major players are Vincent Price and Judith Anderson.  Oh, and the music includes the haunting `Laura,' by David Raksin, one of the most famous themes in film history.<br /><br /> LAURA stands up well under repeated viewings.  In the course of a month or so I watched it three times.  First al dente, second with the Rudy Behlmer commentary, third with the David Raksin and Jeanine Basinger commentary.  I haven't watched LAURA for years, and my memory, helpfully enough, failed to retain any of the major plot points, so the big surprises were surprises again, although I have to admit the `falling in love with the painting' stuff was lost on me until pointed out in the commentaries.  The Behlmer track was filled with the historical back story behind the making of this picture, valuable and welcome, although not always pertinent to what was happening on screen at the time.  David Raskin wrote the score for LAURA, Jeanine Basinger is a film professor at Wesleyen University.  Raskin died recently, in 2004, at the age of 92.  Raskin's contributions on the track are pretty slight, perhaps he was in declining health when it was recorded, and it seems likely Basinger is on the same track to fill in the long silences.  They don't sound like they're conversing, and Basinger doesn't add a lot of information that we don't already get from Behlmer's track.<br /><br /> Anyway, it's another feature on a feature packed dvd.  Two episodes of A&E's Biography series are included.  The first is titled `Gene Tierney - A Shattered Portrait.'  If you don't know much about Tierney's life, and I didn't, this is a bit of an eye-opener.  The strong impression is of a graced life beset by tragedy and tragedy-induced mental instability.  Among the talking heads in this 1999 production are Richard Widmark and first husband Oleg Cassini.  A much happier life is the subject of the second feature, the 2000 `Vincent Price - The Versatile Villain.'  Roger Corman, Dennis Hopper and others fondly remember the actor who bore the `irresistible air of wickedness.'  On its own LAURA is first-rate.  The extras don't add anything to its luster, but they make for a bountiful feast.</p></body></html>

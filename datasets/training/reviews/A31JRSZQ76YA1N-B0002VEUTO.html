<meta name="summary" content=""A MIDSLUMBER KNIGHT'S DREAM""></head><body><p>So, Judi Dench plays "Puck" in this semi-tribute to Bill's "Midsummer Knight's Dream". [or is it ARIEL?  No, that was Robbie the Robot - same thing].  Lord preserve us  - Vinnie the D. smiles rarely and should have his cinematographer shot [those Elmer Fudd moments ....]<br /><br />Karl Urban brings a 'somewhat' breath of fresh air [ala Liz Ashley in "The Carpetbaggers"]to this rather tired but overblown space saga that seems to consist of David Lynch's endless outtakes from DUNE ......ISN'T ANYTHING SOMEWHAT ORIGINAL HERE?  This thing smatters of Lange, Wagner [Lohengrin?]<br /><br />Thandie Newton, Linus Roach and Colm Feore apparrently have drifted in form the John Wilkes Booth roadshow version of Shakespeare's "MacBeth" [or possibly 'Titus Andronicus']production ala 1861....or am I giving too much credit to their thespian powers?<br /><br />Effects?  Interesting, quaint, interesting ... love the 'corpsophone' but isn't that 'typical' Lynch or his mythical mentor JEAN COCTEAU??  [Take a gander at "Orphee' then rewatch this one].<br /><br />Costume design?  [The boys must have feared for their manhood - as for those clompy shoes ... and primitive guns ...  Miss Thandie is appropriately reptlian close to Rambova's schmattes for Nazimova 'the deco Camille']<br /><br />Took me 3 sittings to get through it - plus 'liquid' refreshment ...<br />5 stars?<br /><br />For sheer balls!<br />Can't wait for # 3!</p></body></html>

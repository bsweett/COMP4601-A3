<meta name="summary" content="Both very silly and very smart"></head><body><p>Buddy has always been a little different.  As one of Santa's elves, Buddy (Will Ferrell) grew to well over six feet tall and never seemed to display the usual elfin preternatural gift for toy craftsmanship (while other elves knocked out a thousand Etch-a-Sketches per day, Buddy couldn't top one hundred).  His confusion ends one day when Buddy learns the residents of The North Pole adopted him many years ago.  With that new information, the full-grown adult with a perpetual child-like disposition sets out toward New York City in search of the father he never knew existed.<br /><br />Buddy's "fish-out-of-water" adventures in New York and his search for love and acceptance from his father (James Caan) make up most of the action of "Elf".  In NYC, Buddy discovers gum on the street isn't free candy and signs that read "world's best cup of coffee" aren't necessarily true.  The filmmakers make a bold and wise decision by refraining from having Buddy change (to grow up and lose his na?ve, trusting demeanor).  He remains the sincere, wide-eyed elf throughout the entire film, never forgetting to take time to enjoy himself by consuming copious amounts of syrup and making himself sick by going round and around in revolving doors.<br /><br />Not only does "Elf" refrain from re-cycling the same tired stories usually seen during the holiday season, it takes jabs at Christmas specials of the past.  The opening act is filled with witty, clever incidents that arise when elves raise a human and when the child grows up and returns to society.  The early comic set-ups seem to come from people who know and love the Rudolph/Frosty specials but still can't resist lampooning them a bit.<br /><br />As with most light-hearted comedies, the first half of the film provides more entertainment than the last half.  Most of the funny incidents help establish the character of Buddy and the conflict of his life in New York.  Thus, once that is established, the film becomes more about a clich&eacute;d plot where Buddy's father needs to learn about the true spirit of Christmas and blah blah blah.<br /><br />Even with an obvious and predictable ending, viewing "Elf" must be described as a wholly enjoyable experience.  Will Ferrell once again allows himself to play a character that audiences will want to laugh at (not with).  He is simple, ignorant, illogical...and utterly irresistible.  The film's appeal tethers itself to Ferrell's Buddy and is the result of clever, witty people (Ferrell, Director Favreu and writer Berenbaum) who have learned that "silly" and "smart" are not mutually exclusive traits.</p></body></html>

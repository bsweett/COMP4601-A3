And sadly, I think with his idealism was some sort of mental illness. I think he was bi-polar. He admitted he liked his emotional ups and downs. At times his rants against the government and civilization was funny, touching and sad all at the same time. Perhaps I saw a little of myself in him since I have had (and will continue to have) similar rants. Just pure anger and frustration at the world. His "salvation" in the long run killed him. Died by one of the bears he loved. Watching this movie, it seems bound to happen, I just wish that his girlfriend wasn't with him and shared his fate.<br /><br />He couldn't accept animals being themselves, the killing and torture that they inflict on each other. He had this view of the universe being in nature and harmony. The Director Werner Herzog of this film sees it differently. He sees the universe as in constant chaos. To me, it's a paradox. There is chaos in the harmony, harmony in the chaos. We are all one, yet still separate at the same time. An Native American museum curator said his people (Inuit?) lived there in Alaska for 7,000 years and knows that the bears and humans have their own worlds and left each other alone.<br /><br />I think Timothy had a good heart but I think trying to become one with the bears was foolhardy and sadly what happened was his ultimate destiny. He's not a hero in my eyes but a tender soul who didn't respect nature's boundaries.</p></body></html>

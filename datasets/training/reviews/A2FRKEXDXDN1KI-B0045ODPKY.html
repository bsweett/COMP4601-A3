<meta name="summary" content="Blu-ray: Awesome PQ/AQ/Special Features but you also get three versions of the films.  I am impressed by this release!!!!"></head><body><p>Move over James Bond!  Stand aside Jason Bourne! Welcome Evelyn Salt.<br /><br />If there is one formula in Hollywood that seems to work, that is having actress Angelina Jolie as your action star. The actress has appeared in several action-based films such as the "Tomb Raider" films, "Wanted", "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" and her films continue to be box office hits but her role as Evelyn Salt may just be what Hollywood has been wanting and needing, a femme fatale, a spy who literally kicks ass!  And there is no doubt about it, Evelyn Salt kicks ass and the potential of her character is fantastic.<br /><br />In 2010, Jolie's spy thriller "SALT" became another dominating hit film in the box office for the actresss raking in over $293 million worldwide and now the Blu-ray and DVD release of "SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition" will be released courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on December 21st.  And for those who love the film, will enjoy more of Evelyn Salt as you get three different versions of the film.<br /><br />"SALT" is directed by Phillip Noyce ("The Patriot Games", "Clear and Present Danger", "The Bone Collector") and features a screenplay by Kurt Wimmer ("The Thomas Crown Affair", "Law Abiding Citizen", "Ultraviolet"), music by James Newton Howard ("The Dark Knight", "The Sixth Sense", "The Fugitive") and cinematography by Robert Elswith ("Duplicity", "There Will Be Blood", "Michael Clayton" and "Boogie Nights").<br /><br />"SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition" comes with three different versions of the film.  While there will be two DVD releases of the film, one with the original theatrical edition and the other with a director's cut and extended edition.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release of "SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition", It is important to note that there are three different versions of the film.  The original theatrical edition and the extended edition are literally two different films in which the story of both films tend to go on different paths right after Evelyn meets up with Orlov.<br /><br />The director's cut has a few slight modifications to the original theatrical edition with a voice over that changes the ending of the original theatrical version of the film.  So, in essence, each of the three versions of "SALT" have a different ending.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />"SALT" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The picture quality of "SALT" is absolutely fantastic.  "SALT" is a film that looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray.  The colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and deep and plenty of detail galore.  The cinematography by Robert Elswit combined with the visual effects really make "SALT" look realistic.  From the scenes on the White House lawn to the visual effects to make New York look lively from high above to the detail of Angelina Jolie's hair and her teary eyes.<br /><br />I didn't detect any blurriness, compression artifacts, banding...no visual blemishes at all.  "SALT" looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"SALT" is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and an English - Audio Description Track Dolby Surround English Stereo.  Because this is an action film, you can expect a solid lossless 5.1 DTS-HD soundtrack.  From crowd ambiance, glass shattering, cars crashing into each other, bullets hitting metal,  bullets zipping to trains on the tracks and many instances of things blowing up, there is a good amount of sound being diverted to the surround channels and just enough LFE that makes "SALT" really envelop the soundscape in your viewing area.<br /><br />There is not one scene that I can say this is where the best sound is because these action sequences are so frequent and numerous that you can expect an active soundtrack throughout the film.<br /><br />Dialogue is crystal clear, as with the music soundtrack coming from the front and center channels.  "SALT" features a wonderful lossless soundtrack that compliments its wonderful picture quality.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"SALT" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Added Footage Marker - A marker that is activated during the viewing of the film and points out the differences between the unrated director's cut and unrated extended cut as compared to the theatrical version of the film.<br />  * movieIQ - If you are watching "SALT" on a Blu-ray 2.0 player connected to the Internet, you can pull up cast information and other information about the film.<br />  * Spy Cam: Picture-in-Picture - While watching "SALT", you get a picture-in-picture sequence in which the filmmaker, producer or talent talk about the various scenes of the film and you get to see the behind-the-scenes making of various scenes from "SALT".<br />  * The Ultimate Female Action Hero - (8:04) Director Phillip Noyce, producers and cast talk about how Angelina Jolie is an awesome actress who is willing to take on fearless role.

"SALT" was an awesome film and on Blu-ray, it's even better because you get three versions of the film.<br /><br />But there is so much that I loved about the film.  For one, it was great to see a female heroine (or is she a villain?) and Angelina Jolie did a magnificent job!  According to director Phillip Noyce, Jolie wanted a Bond-like character and simply, the character of Evelyn Salt fit perfectly.  Also, a wonderful job by actors Liev Schreiber, Chiewetel Ejiofor and Daniel Olbrychski.  But it's hard to talk about these characters without spoiling the film, also its even more difficult to even talk about the original theatrical version of the film now that the Blu-ray release has these different versions.  And dare I say, the director's cut and the very different extended version were much better than the original.<br /><br />So, I'm not going to even bother discussing what I liked about the original film as this is one of those rare moments for a Blu-ray review where the original theatrical edition may not mean as much as you may have a liking towards the other two versions of the films.  I have to admit that when I watched "SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition", I figured that this release would have wonderful PQ and AQ, especially since it was an intense spy thriller with so many action scenes, that was a given.  But I was not expecting a film that would literally feature a different second half and become a whole new different story.  It was wonderfully done and to be truthful, I kind of wished that the extended version was the original theatrical version.  But still both this and the director's cut of the film were well-done and a major improvement over the original.<br /><br />According to director Philip Noyce, the change of endings was the filmmaker trying to keep the focus of who is the ultimate villain to one character than the other.  He enjoyed both versions, I enjoyed both versions and I have no doubt that the viewers will too. Unlike other films which have various versions included on a Blu-ray disc. typically they don't exactly add much to the film but in the case of "SALT", these three different versions of the film included are quite substantial.  But for me, the extended version literally ends with a bang and has a memorable shot of Evelyn Salt.  A shame the extended version was not used for the theatrical version as it would have been a classic shot.<br /><br />And just when you think you have watched all three films and that you are done, there is somewhat of a fourth way to watch the film in which you can watch the film but have a picture-in-picture segment on the making of "SALT". You also get audio commentary for each of the three films.<br /><br />Granted, it's the same commentary but with additional commentary supporting those differing scenes or added footage.  You also get a good amount of special features, especially an interesting featurette by former spies from the CIA and KGB who talk about how life really was for a spy plus other featurettes such as radio interview, visual effects making of, disguises of Evelyn Salt and more.  And last, for the videophiles and audiophiles, "SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition" is fantastic!  Awesome PQ and AQ to literally round out this magnificent Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, if you enjoyed "SALT", you're going to love "SALT: Deluxe Unrated Edition".  Such a refreshing character and I am hoping for a sequel!<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

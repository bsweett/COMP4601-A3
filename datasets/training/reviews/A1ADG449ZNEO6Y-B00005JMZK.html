Anderson.I mean through the whole movie , there's a group of people being seperated in a giant underground pyramid.No matter how much I love the Predator , the movie just didn't take place anywhere else but a dark pyramid.Also another note.The Predator's faces look alot different.To me they look stupid.The mouths open up more , the eyes are bigger and one thing I like they are more smarter in a dumb way.One Predator lets a facehugger attack him and lays an alien inside of a Predator "which is at the end".The Aliens on the other hand kicks the dogg crap out of the Predators.I can never get enough of the whole character of the Predator , so I will be buying this movie.Also going back to the Predator's again , they have more weapons , armor and all types of gadgets.</p></body></html>

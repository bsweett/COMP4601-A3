<meta name="summary" content="A movie that profiles an anxious moment in space."></head><body><p>Ron Howard should be commended for directing the true story on one of the most anxious moments in the world. The crew of the Apollo 13 faced some agonizing moments during that week in April,1970. I enjoyed the work of Tom Hanks in this movie. To me it was one of his best next to Forest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and Cast Away. Hanks is an actor for all seasons. Good movie and a good price for this two set DVD collection!</p></body></html>

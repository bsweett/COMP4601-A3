His buddy is a black dude who claims to be JFK who survived the Dallas assassination.  After scientists uncover a mummy in Egypt and transfer it to the USA for a tour, the bus carrying it accidentally drives off a bridge into a river near the nursing home.  Leave it to Elvis and JFK to kill the soul sucking mummy who is out to kill everyone to survive.  Its complete camp and over the top.  At first reading, I thought this might be fun, but it?s a sophomoric attempt at gallows humor with some (actually) funny foul-mouthed humor.  For under age twenty-five only.  Enjoy.<br /><br />There are tons of extra features, but for the life of me I don't know why.</p></body></html>

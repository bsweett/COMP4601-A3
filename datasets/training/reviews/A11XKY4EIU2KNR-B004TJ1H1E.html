Some Like it Hot is a comedy that anybody can enjoy time and again. The reason it was shot in black and white (for those who don't know) was because Jack and Tony's makeup gave their faces a greenish tint on color film. The jokes, one liners, and slapstick make this a classic that will live forever. The last line of the movie makes a stand as one of the all time greatest gags.<p>You better believe Marilyn sings in this one too. 'I wanna be loved by you', 'I'm through with love', and my favorite 'Running Wild' show her singing talents that she was never appreciated for in her day. <p>In the tradition of the Three Stooges, Abbot and Costello, and Laurel and Hardy, this movie has withstood the harshest test of all movies, time.</p></body></html>

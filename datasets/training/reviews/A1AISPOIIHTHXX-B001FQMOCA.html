<meta name="summary" content="Music and talent coming together for one great movie"></head><body><p>The film is most likely going to get comparisons to Ray, the biopic about Ray Charles starring Oscar winner Jamie Foxx. That's unfortunate since personally I liked this film more. Granted you might find similarities with the films but only because the legend's lives just happened to go across similar paths. Ray to me would've fell apart if it wasn't for Jamie Foxx. Walk the Line meanwhile works with everything.<br /><br />After a quick clip of Folsom Prison concert, the films opens with Johnny Cash as a youngin living at home with his brother and parents. Johnny(called J.R) is out fishing while his brother works with a saw. An accident happens and his brother dies which only confirms that his father doesn't think much of him. The film then jumps to Johnny in the Air Force as he's starting to write music. He eventually starts writing and gets some popularity but the important part is he met June Carter, a divorced mother of 2. Johnny gets impulsive about his feelings which she rejects while trying to help him with his addictions.<br /><br />The film wins thanks to its 2 leads with Joaquin Phoenix pulling off a great portrayal of the Men in Black while Reese Witherspoon(who hasn't really done much well known dramatic work) brings a spunk to June. While you might listen to Ray's soundtrack which largely had Jamie Foxx lip synching, Joaquin and Reese did their own singing and while it's not dead on, it's quite impressive to hear them. Listening to "I Walk the Line" in the film was like wow, he's quite good.<br /><br />In a way it's probably one of the better examples of a real-life love story. Not big goo-goo eyes with the occasional fight, this has heartbreak, pain, anguish and everything else that goes along with. Johnny goes through so much to win her back and just as far when she rejects him. Unlike Ray which had multiple wives, here it's the affections for one while trying to deal with a less-than-happy other. We end up liking it more rather than just "wife #3".<br /><br />There's much to like about Walk the Line, from its performances to its rock music, it's a fascinating insight to a legend's life.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Amazing Classic"></head><body><p>It started with the gift of Harper Lee's magical book, a gift to literature., indeed. Then came the movie, a gift to cinema that withstands the test of time. <p>Just look at the opening credits, quite possibly one of the most ingenious and modern looking segments in cinema over the last forty years. It's simplicity absolutely captures the film, while setting the magical mystery on its course, the world of children in a box.<p>Then move on to Gregory Peck's most moving, strong, amazing performance; it's quite possibly the perfect match with role, actor, screenplay. His dignity shines through a dignified role.<p>And then there are the kids, two unknowns, who do their best acting by just being themselves. Mary Badham is absolutely charming and stunning in her innocent portrayal of a terribly difficult role.<p>But what shines most is the story... the story of a black man unjustly accused of a hideous act, the story of a spooky man who lives a life of hiding, ultimately, how we judge others is how we are judged. <p>And that is the lasting gift of this movie, and this DVD.<p>Note: the bonus documentary on the DVD is amazing, long, and very informative, worth all of your time.</p></body></html>

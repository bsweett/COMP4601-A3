Now we know that she finally believes his fantastical claim that the seemingly innocuous nearby apartment dweller (pre-Perry Mason Raymond Burr in a white wig)has in fact murdered his nagging invalid wife.<p>Stewart has been laid up for weeks in his apartment with a leg cast, unable to pursue his adventurous life as a daredevil photographer. Bored, he has taken to watching the antics of the apartment dwellers across the way. Things look a little strange about Burr and his now-absent wife, so Stewart's long-dormant imagination takes him into a cat and mouse game with dangerous consequences.<p>I like &quot;Rear Window&quot; quite a lot: the speaking actors are all first-rate, like the aforementioned Stewart and Kelly, and also reliable Thelma Ritter as the visiting nurse who has her own pet theories about where &quot;things&quot; might be buried. Then there's a  pile of non-speaking actors, the pantomine players comprising the apartment dwellers, whose skill makes the whole movie work. Costuming for Grace is great, too; there are numerous occasions for her to spin about in haute couture outfits while trying to tempt the wheelchair bound Stewart away from his voyeuristic habits.<p>If you've ever tried to piece together what the folks across the courtyard from you are doing, whether behind drawn shades or out in plain sight, throw open &quot;Rear Window&quot; and take a peek.</p></body></html>

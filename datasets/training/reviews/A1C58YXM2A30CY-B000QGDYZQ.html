<meta name="summary" content="Nothing But the Dead & Dying in this Little Town!"></head><body><p>I see plot holes sinking this ship!<br /><br />Premonition is about a woman, Linda (somewhat believably played by Sandra Bullock) who in some mysterious way is living out another time period where her husband dies about two weeks later.<br /><br />What gets me about Linda is how it takes her so darn long to figure out what is happening.  For example, she sees a bottle of lithium that was dumped down the drain in her sink and has no idea how it got there.  She looks at the bottle and it has a doctor's name on it, Dr. Roth.  Then later, when she falls asleep she reawakens in her new world, looks up Dr. Roth whom she has not met yet.  She tries to explain what's happening to her, where she believes her husband is dead but he's not really dead.  Dr. Roth thinks she's nuts and gives her a bottle of lithium.  Later in the day, she dumps it in the bathroom sink.<br /><br />Does she say to herself, "Wow, that's just like in my earlier dream!" Or say "Maybe since I've reliving this before I will see what I can do to change it."  Nope, no clue.  The audience (me) is frustrated that Linda is not figuring out any of this.<br /><br />The characters are very cardboard.  Her mom, for example, has her committed to Dr. Roth's care because of something that happened to one of her children (we don't yet know why at this point).  No real explanation other than implying Linda somehow was responsible for her daughter being cut up.  Later in the tale, when she relives the earlier time (yeah, confusing, and convoluted) her daughter goes through a plate glass window.<br /><br />Now, why would her mother call the psychs to lock up Linda if Linda had nothing to do with her daughter getting cut up.  Don't get it.<br /><br />Oh wait, gets better!<br /><br />Linda finally figures out (she's pretty slow) that she's reliving some other time.  She makes a calendar of sorts and starts to figure out what's going on, without telling her mom because of her predilection for locking up daughters in mental hospitals.<br /><br />Another throw-away scene tries to explain what's going on.  A priest she visits (not sure who or why) opens a book (which is not explained where he got it) that goes over people reliving other times and see them as warnings.  He then goes over how some people can't change this because "nature abhors a vacuum" and that if you don't have faith or love then you are doomed to your fate.<br /><br />OK, fine.  She takes this to heart.  She tries to love her husband and children more.  She tries really hard.  And then [SPOILER] the thing that she fears happens anyway, DESPITE her efforts!  Inexorable fate.  Can't change it, despite faith and hope.  Yuk!  [END SPOILER]<br /><br />Sandra Bullock walks through her part, a bit clueless and has a cheating husband on her hands who is also clueless.<br /><br />The script does not have that neat Hollywood polish of a happy ending which, frankly it really needed!<br /><br />Like Clooney's "Perfect Storm", you love the characters and yet they meet their end anyway.  The film makes you feel empty and lifeless.  Not suicidal, but almost.<br /><br />There are much, much better Bullock movies.  Skip this one.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002K0WBXW">The Proposal (Single Disc Widescreen)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VECM6S">The Blind Side</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NA1WE0">Miss Congeniality / Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous (Double Feature)</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Classic Rambo Action Film!!!"></head><body><p>The original is always the best! No one could have done it better than Stallone. Rambo comes to a small quiet town looking for his friend. After he finds out his friend has died, he goes looking for a place to eat, but the sheriff for some reason, doesn't like him. After Rambo escapes custody, he starts his one-man war against the town's police. It has the classic look of the 1980's. If you love action, you'll love FIRST BLOOD!!!</p></body></html>

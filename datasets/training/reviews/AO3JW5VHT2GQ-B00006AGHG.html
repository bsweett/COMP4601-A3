Jackson) just happen to meet when neither of them can really afford to, because when they do, all hell breaks loose.  Gavin is a high-powered attorney on his way to cheat a charity out of millions of dollars.  Doyle is an insurance salesman and a recovering alcoholic who is about to lose his children in a custody hearing.  When Gavin swerves into Doyle on the freeway while distracted on his cell phone, Doyle tries to do what is right by getting Gavin to exchange insurance information.  But Gavin is in such a hurry that instead he simply offers Doyle a blank check.  And even though they are headed to the same courthouse Gavin refuses to offer Doyle a ride.  As it turns out Gavin leaves the major document in his court case at the scene of the accident where Doyle picks it up.  Doyle, not having a ride, rushes to the courthouse but is too late to prevent his wife from gaining complete custody of the kids so she can move out of state and prevent him from seeing them anymore.  <p>Gavin, to save his job and prevent himself from going to prison, needs the folder with the documents from Doyle.  Doyle is upset with Gavin because if he hadn't run into him or, even then, if Gavin had given him a ride, Doyle wouldn't be loosing his kids.  What results is an hour and a half of two men vacillating between trying to kill each other and then trying to help each other for an a very long day. <p>My Comments:<br />First of all, the acting wasn't atrocious, which to me is surprising seeing as how Ben Affleck is, well, a mediocre actor at best (don't believe me? watch Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back).  And Samuel L. Jackson is typically only good when he is violent, which he does get to do occasionally in this movie; otherwise I don't think he can't really act (don't believe me? watch Star Wars: Episode I).  So, the movie was actually surprising in terms of the acting, perhaps because I didn't have very high hopes to begin with.<p>The story idea was actually kind of interesting, but only after they tried to really hurt the other person the first time.  After the five millionth time they tried to hurt the other person the movie lost my interest completely.  I was continuously staring at the time counter to see how long the movie was going to continue, and it just kept going and going.  What's worse, nothing is ever really resolved in a satisfactory way - Gavin is still a crook, but what's worse, he blackmails his bosses who are crooks (making him doubly crooked?).  <p>Which leads to the next point, the whole subplot of Gavin finding out that he is a 'dirty' lawyer was pretty [weak].  It was almost as though the director of the movie realized that the main plot was only worth about 50 minutes of screen time so he had to come up with some pretty [weak] subplots to fill up another 40 to 50 minutes.<p>After the movie was over my wife was convinced that she had just lost nearly two hours of time - time that was completely wasted.  When I pressed her for what she thought, her first comment was, "Do you really think people would behave that way?"  My response, "Well, would we really want to watch a movie where the people were normal?"  But, I must admit, the movie was remarkably far-fetched, at least from my perspective.  I'm not a New Yorker and I've never been to New York, so perhaps the portrayal of these two New Yorkers as vicious, almost homicidal, maniacs was accurate, but I highly doubt it.  <p>Anyway, I think you could possibly enjoy this movie if you watched about the first 30 minutes then about the last ten.  The repeated attacks back and forth are tedious, pointless, and tiresome.  I don't recommend this movie unless you enjoy road rage.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A SIMPLE PLAN..."></head><body><p>An entire family is annihilated after a desperate businessman named Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) convinces his weak-willed brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) to commit a robbery. Nothing goes according to plan, and everything that can go wrong, does. BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD is a story of total hopelessness. I kept wanting the situation to improve, knowing full well that things could / would only get worse. Marisa Tomei (Danika) plays Andy's frustrated, cheating wife. Albert Finney is Andy and Hank's tormented dad. BTDKYD has a delightfully bleak atmosphere throughout. I like the way it develops from a semi-humorous caper into an outrageous tragedy. Director, Sidney Lumet has certainly kept his sharp edge! Well worth owning...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's not about boxing. And it's not about the twist ending."></head><body><p>"Million Dollar Baby" is a great, no-frills, to-the-gut movie. It's not just about boxing, despite what you may think after seeing the trailer, and it's not about the twist ending, though the movie is better if you don't know what's coming at the end. It's tightly made, carries a hell of an impact and features some of the best acting you're likely to see onscreen this year.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood gives one of his best performances in years - if not his best ever - as Frankie Dunn, a grizzled boxing coach so beaten up by life that he refuses to allow his contending fighters to take any risks or any chances. Frankie counsels his fighters to approach a title bout with the sort of reluctance and pre-destined disappointment that he applies to his entire life. He goes to church every week, but he's a guilt-ridden skeptic, not really a believer. He wants a relationship with his daughter, but she has made it abundantly clear that she wants nothing to do with him. Given any number of opportunities, he's taken none of them. Frankie runs a gym with his closest friend Scrap Iron (Morgan Freeman), who used to be one of Frankie's boxers until he lost an eye.<br /><br />Into Frankie's life comes Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a waitress who wants to be a boxer even though she has no training, is a bit out-of-shape and is way too old to start a serious career.<br /><br />For the first half of the film, it does follow the formula of a "boxing movie;" however, these characters are fleshed-out and real, and the movie is more about following dreams that only you can see and rising above the circumstances that you're presented with. The last portion of the film is about how life, even when it's sweet, can be desperately unfair.<br /><br />The movie's heartbreaking, compelling and grand. I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

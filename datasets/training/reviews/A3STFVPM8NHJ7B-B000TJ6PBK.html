Samuel L Jackson has a great part but its a bit part. The movie starts basically with a few little giggles but dont expect to much horror. Its about a man dealing with the lose of his child. I thought the ending was cheap but alas, it wasnt the ending. Id highly recommend this movie. The real ending brought chills up my spine and that is something that never happens.</p></body></html>

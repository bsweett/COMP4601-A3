Fortunately, for us, he has a revelation and the result is no end of fun and good cheer. This low-life slacker comes to terms with his own ability to shape young minds burdened with the typical teen-angst, such as bullies, insecurity, non-understanding parents, self-esteem and the like (which he seems to naturally understand). Mr. Black is absolutely absurd in his approach, and it's the kids who inspire him to be a better person. The success of this film is largely due to wonderful direction from maverick director, Richard Linklater; "The School of Rock" takes off and flies high. The very able support of Joan Cusack is not to be forgotten. What I found most intriguing about the film is that each kid has a story to tell, and you find yourself cheering for the kids. The story doesn't say a lot about what happens to Black's character, but you know these once up-tight kids are going to be fine. Jack Black is the lead, but the kids are the real stars. This is a great feel-good movie. I'm glad I rented it. The DVD extras are fine.</p></body></html>

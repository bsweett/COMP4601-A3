<meta name="summary" content="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I"></head><body><p>In part seven of the Harry Potter series, we see great actors either returning to reprise their roles or showing up for the first time. Returning as a Ministry of Magic employee is former Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher and temporary Headmistress of Hogwarts Delores Umbridge, played by Oscar nominee Imelda Staunten. Joining the cast for the first time is the amazing Bill Nighy (Still Crazy, Shaun of the Dead) playing the new Minister of Magic (unfortunately too short- lived a role), as well as the brilliant Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill, and the underrated Human Nature) as Luna Lovegood's father Xenophilius Lovegood. In the end what really makes this movie great is the characterization. This film would not work were it not for Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint doing their jobs properly. In Deathly Hallows, it's Rupert Grint who really delivers. Rupert has always been the comedic relief of the group, but here he provides the dramatic tension and performs beyond admirably.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is all about character development. Yates, who's now directed more Harry Potter films than any other director in the series, does a great job of creating a film that maintains tension both between its main characters and the ever-present forces of good and evil that dominate the wizarding world. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is not about action or plot development; it focuses its attention largely on the people involved in these extraordinary adventures. J.K. Rowling gave us all a gift by creating such memorable figures to populate her books, and the directors of the Harry Potter films develop these well-loved characters against a brilliantly realized backdrop.<br /><br />[Spoiler Alert: If you have not read the books or seen the movie I recommend that you not read past this point]<br /><br />That said, Deathly Hallows is not without its flaws.  The changes that were made to realize this story in cinematic form are rather problematic. There's no full explanation as to why Dobby is around, so had you not read the book his presence might have been confusing. Kreacher's actions are also a mystery, as the troublesome house elf acquiesces too soon and easily to Harry's request without further explanation. Were it not for plot holes of this nature, this film would be much better. As the series has progressed, it seems that the Harry Potter films have strayed further and further from the source material. I'm a big fan of Order of the Phoenix and Half Blood Prince, both directed by Yates, but those movies left viewers ill prepared for this installment.<br /><br />The problem with converting this series into film form is the same as it is with any movie based on a book: the conflict that exists between the viewer's perception of the book and the director's. Most people would say that there has to be something wrong with either the viewer or the director when it comes to an adaptation of a novel, but in reality there's nothing wrong with either--they just sometimes differ. When it comes to Harry Potter, I'm a fan of both the books and the film adaptations, and one of the things that I like about the movies is the vision of the director. Yates has been brilliant at building these characters beyond what we've seen from them previously, and he continues to do just that in Deathly Hallows. There are things I would love to see in the movie adaptation, such as Kreacher's story of how he helped Regulus recover the locket, but would that detract from the story of Harry, Hermoine, and Ron? Most likely. That's why Yates is great. He knows where the real brilliance of the story lies, and that we can fill in the details by reading the books. He puts on film only what we need.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Yates is the fourth director involved in this series and the only one making these films with a knowledge of how Harry Potter's story ends. As a result, he's had to include things in this film that don't seem to make sense because of omissions made in earlier installments. Had Dobby been more involved in Goblet of Fire, his presence in this film would have seemed more logical and his death would have been more meaningful to the movie viewers who haven't read the books.<br /><br />[End of Spoilers]<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is a good movie, but not the best of the series. To a point it feels slightly episodic and ends quite abruptly. The acting is amazing, and the visuals are brilliant. One can't help but get the feeling that this is leading to something bigger.</p></body></html>

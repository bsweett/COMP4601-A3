<meta name="summary" content="Sean Penn Paves the Way In This Powerful Film"></head><body><p>Well, I can certainly see why Sean Penn took home the Oscar for Best Actor this year.  His performance in "Milk" was incredible.  He's one of those few actors who totally immerses himself in the parts he plays, much like Daniel Day-Lewis or Robert De Niro.  He's been doing this for quite some time now.  Even his fellow actors from "Fast Times At Ridgemont High" said that he was in character of Jeff Spiccoli during the entire shoot.<br /><br />I was just a kid during the time and events that this film covers, so I enjoyed learning about Harvey Milk and the influence he had in San Francisco poltics, California politics, and even the influences he had nationally as well.<br /><br />"Milk" tells the story of Harvey Milk, a gay man from New York who decides that it's time for a change.  He's just met his new love interst, Scott, whom he tells to "keep a lid" on their relationship.  They both move to San Francisco, and Milk quickly deduces that in order to effect the changes he wants to see, he can stay in the closet no longer.<br /><br />He runs for City Supervisor several times, only to lose each and every time.  However, he finds that he's quickly gaining support of the local gay community, and that the number of votes he's receiving during each election is on the rise.<br /><br />Finally, he wins the position of City Supervisor, and Milk finds himself in the middle of every cause he can think of...not just the rights of gays, but any discrimination that exists whether it be due to color, age, or race.<br /><br />Granted, each battle seems to be an uphill one, but Milk is filled with a resolve, and he won't quit, even when his partner, Scott, has had enough and leaves him.<br /><br />The pinnacle part of the film is Milk battling against Proposition 6, which repeals many rights for gay people.  He challenges his rival, Senator Briggs who feels that gay people shouldn't have any rights at all, and is even on a crusade to expose each and every one of them.  Milk holds several memorable and poignant debates with the senator throughout the state of California.<br /><br />I've always found it interesting that when there is a cause to fight for, a champion comes along to spear-head it.  Milk is that champion for gay people, even though he's actually fighting against all forms of discrimination.<br /><br />The movie is narrated by Milk who is recording his life story on tape, already seeming to sense that he won't be around much longer.  Ironically, Milk tells Scott that he doesn't feel that he'll live to be 50.<br /><br />There are great performances all around in this film, not only by Sean Penn, but also by James Franco (Scott), Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna, and Josh Brolin.  Brolin plays Dan White, a fellow City Supervisor and the instrument of Milk's death.  What I didn't forsee, was that Milk's assassination was politically motivated as White had lost his job and felt that Milk and the Mayor were responsible, rather than it being a hate crime against Milk's sexual orientation.<br /><br />What I enjoyed about the movie was that it focused on Milk's cause.  People who might be uncomfortable about the possibility of sexual scenes needn't worry.  The movie isn't "in your face" and nothing is depicted really, beyond some kissing. (Course, if that bothers you than you may want to take a pass on this film.)<br /><br />Gus Van Sant is a terrific director; one who brought us great films like "Good Will Hunting," and "Milk" is another testament to his abilities as a director.<br /><br />There are some movies that are simply important to watch, because they give us a sense of where we came from, where we are going, and how important it is to be tolerant and accepting of people, regardless of their differences.  "Milk" is such a film.</p></body></html>

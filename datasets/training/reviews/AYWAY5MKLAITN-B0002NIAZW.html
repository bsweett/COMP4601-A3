I admit that the sepcial effects were great but I have got to tell you something: CGI and WOLVES do not go together. Not in my book. If you wanna present danger than get real wolves. Don't toy with my emotions. Also, it's kind of hard to believe that the scientist would plead to death about dealing with the situation and no one listens. Believe me, after all the things that the earth goes through you'd think that someone would listen. Anyway, That's what I have to grip about.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Only a couple of suspenseful scenes + below-average special effects = Worth watching once"></head><body><p>There is very little suspense in this movie. One of the scary scene was when the old lady walked from inside a wall to the window and fell out in to the street. She silently disappeared when hitting the street.<br />Another one when John Cusack dropped the bed lamp to the street from his 14th floor suite to see if he's hallucinating. The lamp hit the street without making any nose. Then it disappeared. Meanwhile, John could hear people talking and car honking from the street.<br /><br />Most of  the other scenes have been done in other horror movies before. For example, the door automatically locked him up. He could not open it etc. The special effects look fake.<br /><br />The worst thing about this story is that at the end it suggested all John Cussack experienced was caused by his imagination! It's because nobody else saw anything. The room was perfectly in tact after John was rescued. How scary it was!<br /><br />This movie is worth renting not buying.<br /><br />"28 days later" is still on the top of my list of Horror Movies.</p></body></html>

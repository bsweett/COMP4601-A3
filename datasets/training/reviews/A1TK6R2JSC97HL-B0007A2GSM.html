Identities are secret, but heroes seem to keep them only for buying groceries, and remain perfectly at home when masked, flying and crime-fighting.  Unfortunately, the world is too comfy with heroes, and cavalierly finds itself needing their assistance.  When a spate of lawsuits proves too much for Mr. Incredible himself (Craig T. Nelson) to handle, he and other heroes are placed into a witness-protection program for ex-crime fighters.  Already married to Elasti-Girl (Holly Hunter) Mr. Incredible settles reluctantly into assumed suburban living (dead-end job working for an insurance company; ridiculous car; NO crime fighting), father's some kids and hangs up his suit.  Never forgetting his past glory days, or that they are in fact in his past, Incredible chomps at the bit for a chance to return.  He gets it when a mysterious beautiful woman offers him a ridiculous sum of money to help contain her latest invention - an agressive robot that, among other things, can learn from its mistakes and those of its enemies.  After a trip to the island of the robot's mysterious creator, Incredible learns a darker secret, one that will force him to enlist the aid of his wife and two of their three super-powered children.<br /><br />First off, does anybody remember the 80's comic "Watchmen"?  For those who have, the surprise is how much of that dark and mean-spirited comic novel has found its way into a fim that is completely unlike it in tone.  "Incredibles" is fun - though its loud and fast, and has some CGI relared viokence and may otheriwse scare some younger viewers (mine sat through the whole thing w/o problem).  With its Pixar-aniamted world, this is a story that can pick and choose when it will thrill or just go for the easy laugh.  Either way it goes, I cam out of this movie seeing something I hadn't seen in a while - a standing ovation.</p></body></html>

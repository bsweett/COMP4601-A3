I had expected one of those "mess with your head" movies where the viewer is never quite certain who was telling the truth and who was lying (or just blatantly wrong). So I was rather surprised and a bit disappointed when Philip Seymour Hoffman pretty much shows up in the first scene wearing an "Hello, I am a pedophile" T-shirt.<br /><br />Not that this was a bad call on the part of the movie-makers. Hoffman's recent roles have been enough of the "shifty, guilty, and terribly wrong" variety (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112S8RS">Before the Devil Knows You're Dead</a>) that it would be difficult for movie-goers to jump past that particular little type-casting long enough to give Hoffman the benefit of the doubt, particularly after a couple of decades of seemingly endless priest scandals and an unforgettable viewing of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJH2">Deliver Us from Evil</a>. So even though a token effort is made to make Streep seem unfairly mean and spiritually shriveled, and to make Hoffman seem like a "jus' folks" kind of guy whose love for kids is completely wholesome, it's always clear that this token effort is made to excuse the doubts of the ancillary characters only, never to seriously engender doubts in the viewer.<br /><br />Not that the ancillary characters need much coaxing to believe the worst of Streep and the best of Hoffman. Adams stars across Streep as her younger foil, and her character is simultaneously frustratingly naive and yet realistically plagued with doubt. Her animosity towards Streep stems largely from an ideological difference in teaching (Adams thinks children are all unique butterflies and Streep thinks children are all unruly ruffians), but even when she makes this animosity plain and clear, Streep merely absorbs the abuse without a blink and carries on as if nothing has happened. By contrast, Hoffman reacts violently and abusively (even going so far as to incorporate the incident into an abusive and twisted sermon on "his version" of the matter) towards the slightest hint that his behavior may have been inappropriate, and Adams fails to notice anything usual or vindictive about this behavior in her haste to exonerate the priest.<br /><br />And here is the crux of the matter: Adams doesn't want Hoffman to be exonerated because she likes him, so much as she NEEDS him to be exonerated so that something awful hasn't happened under her very nose. Streep, on the other hand, is convinced of the truth and will not turn away from her convictions, but she confesses, in the movie's climax, to being haunted by doubts. The question we are left with is: What does she doubt? I do not think she doubts Hoffman's guilt or her own rightness, but rather I believe she doubts either the benevolence/existence of god or the rightness of the Catholic Church she has devoted her life to, or possibly both.<br /><br />I deeply enjoyed this movie, if not as a "who's telling the truth" thriller, then at least as a dramatic depiction of one woman taking on the world, if not to save a child then at least to purge her school of a predator. As a treatise on faith and doubts, it yields no answers, but does provide many thought-provoking questions.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

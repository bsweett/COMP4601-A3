Matt Damon makes a great Bourne, even better than Richard Chamberlain, whom I really liked in the prior version.<br /><br />The bad news is the departures from the book.  I suppose I could get past the stock "CIA-assassination-team" theme, but what I can't get over is the way they turned Bourne from a good guy who lost his memory into a bad guy who lost his memory.  Ludlum (or his family agent) was executive producer, so there's no excuse.  Shame on them for doing that.  Actually, shame on them for underutilizing Julia Stiles too.</p></body></html>

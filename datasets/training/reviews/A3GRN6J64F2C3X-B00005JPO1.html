<meta name="summary" content="Indiana Jones and the Return of the Series We Missed"></head><body><p>Maybe I'm getting too lenient or forgiving in my old age, but I thought "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" was a pretty good time.  Some famous movie figure (I forget who) defined a good movie as one that had three good scenes and no bad ones.  Well, this movie has at least four or five good scenes (sequences, actually), and nothing bad.<br /><br />And the characters and their interactions actually move beyond just being fun and into genuinely memorable territory a time or two, as well.  A favorite moment was when Jim Broadbent's college dean character comments to Indy, during a conversation about the recent losses of Indy's dad and their friend Marcus, that everyone eventually reaches a point where "life stops giving you things and starts taking them away."  That's a sad, resonant line worthy of Hollywood's serious fall dramas.<br /><br />But, yes, this is an action movie primarily, and the action is very good... and it's aided by the most lavish, polished effects of the series.  Likewise the villains, the sense of mystery, Indy's cocky yet "am I sure I know what I'm doing?" attitude with the characters around him, all of it works.<br /><br />Somewhat annoyingly, Paramount, Lucasfilm or whoever is making fans choose between a bare-bones DVD of the film or a two-disc set with all kinds of special features.  I found the latter a bit pricey, so I bought the single-disc version.  However, even here I was able to enjoy a nice little mini-doc (about 17 minutes) about how the new film came to be and a short pre-production piece (about 9 minutes) about the actors' preparations prior to filming.  And that was actually perfect for me, as I enjoy special features on a DVD, but don't like when it gets to be a "tail wagging the dog" situation... you know, where a two-hour movie is accompanied by seven or eight hours of special features.  Maybe in some cases that's good (if the film is a timeless classic or if you're just a huge, huge fan of a certain movie), but mostly I think the film itself should be the centerpiece of its DVD version.<br /><br />Anyway, ignore the nitpickers and pick up this new Indiana Jones adventure (in whatever version suits you).  I can't imagine anyone who enjoyed the other movies in this series not liking this one, too, at least a little.</p></body></html>

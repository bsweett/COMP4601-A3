<meta name="summary" content="Matchstick Men-Cage steals the show"></head><body><p>Matchstick Men, is an immensly entertaining caper comedy from director Ridley Scott.  Nicholas Cage plays Roy, a con man who has obsessive-compulsive disorder works with a parter played by Sam Rockwell, also good here.  Cage and Rockwell are the best here, the pros at what they do.  Making cons successful each time, though when Cage loses his pills to an unforunate accident he must see a psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist advises him to see the past in his life and find out more about his earlier life.  Surprisingly enough a 14 year-old daugher is involved named Angela played by Alison Lohman.<br />  Angela soons learns of her father's profession and wants to learn how to actually perform a con.  From here the film takes on an even more interesting path.  Even though the film as a clever premise, Cage's amazing perfomance dazzles and really keeps you fully focused.  Based on the novel by Eric Garcia, "matchstick" is a slang term for con artists.  Diretor Ridley Scott continues to impress with another wonderful film here aside from his other good work including Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Alien, even Hannibal.<br />  Matchstick Men is rated PG-13 for Thematic Elements, Violence, Some Sexual Content and Language.  The violence includes a brief shooting, the profanity is rather occasional.  The film does have a pleasing, moral ending and the story of a father-daughter relationship really can be gripping.  Worth viewing in theares and possibly owning on video and DVD, a much more better film that you'd expect.</p></body></html>

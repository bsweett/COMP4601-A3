No surprise, it's been like that ever since he released 2 movies in the same year in 2005 (Charlie and Corpse Bride). And when I heard he was creating his own vision of Alice in Wonderland, I was really excited. I certainly couldn't wait, it sounded like it was going to be an excellent movie. However, of course, I got pissed when back in MAY 08, I find out that it would be released in 10 months. So I waited patiently, and when I saw it last night, I wasn't disappointing.<br /><br />Alice in Wonderland currently has a polarized audience reaction going on right now. Either you love it, or you hate it. I was well aware of this when I went to go see it. So that said, I stripped myself of all expectations, left them at the theater door, and just went in ready to take in what the movie was about to give me. And you know what? I wasn't disappointed. Was it Shakespeare-level? No. Was it exactly great? Maybe not, but I REALLY liked it, I have almost nothing (except for a couple boring spots and the ending) to complain about. Therefore, it was enjoyable for me.<br /><br />13 years after the events that Alice experienced, Alice is 19, and lives with her family. She is being pressured upon to accept an engagement from a man she doesn't like. So at the engagement party, after seeing the rabbit show her that she is very late for her important date, she runs to where the rabbit hole is and falls down it one more time. After struggles to shrink herself, she meets up with everyone she knows once again and is taken to The Mad Hatter, who reveals to her that The Red Queen is terrorizing wonderland once again. She must help The Mad Hatter and the white queen stop the Red Queen from eventually overtaking Wonderland before it's too late.<br /><br />So in total, that isn't exactly the best plot for a sequel, is it? Well, I didn't think it was, but that didn't prevent me from really loving the movie. The visuals are very gorgeous like we see in the trailer. The CG is well rendered, and in short it looks gorgeous. As for performances, Alice was portrayed very well by Mia Wasikowska. She really did a great job, she really nailed the role big time. Bonham Carter was great as The Red Queen too- she really has come a long way as her role as the junkie Marla in Fight Club. Of course, Depp never fails to entertain, and Alice in Wonderland is proof- his wacky performance as The Mad Hatter is certainly enough to keep your attention. The only performance that wasn't exactly great was Crispin Glover as Knave of Hearts- that may be in part due to his character, but he wasn't bad in the movie, he did quite good. Just he wasn't one of the better performances.<br /><br />I do have but two complaints- I thought the ending seemed really fanfic-ish, and the movie was slow in a few spots. And also, one more thing- if you're going to see it in 3D, it is really good. I definitely recommend it, as it is well used. That said, I really liked the movie and I can't really see why people are complaining. I guess people need SOMETHING to complain about. So guys, don't be a puppet of the critics, and DON'T let your expectations run away with you. See the movie and decide for yourself.<br /><br />Oh, and someone please tell me where I can learn some of the hatter's funky dance moves.<br /><br />IN TOTAL:<br />Entertainment: 8/10<br />Violence: 4/10- quite a bit in this movie<br />Depp: Mad as a Hatter indeed<br />Gorgeous visuals: A visual feast<br />Burton: May be getting unoriginal, but not declining in terms of directing<br /><br />***Recommended***</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot; is cool, hip, and hilarious!"></head><body><p>I saw &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot; the day that it came to the theater, and I though that it was a really great film from the director of &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;, &quot;Out of Sight&quot;, and &quot;Traffic&quot;. This movie had just about everything...action, great storyline, and laughs. George Clooney was terrific as Danny Ocean, a recently released ex-con who decides that it's time to go back into the thieving business by stealing over $1 million from a luxurious Las Vegas casino. He and Rusty Ryan (played with excellence by Brad Pitt) plan it all out, etc. But how are they going to pull it all off? Get 9 other guys, of course! Among the 9 are Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, and Bernie Mac. Outstanding job from all of them. Andy Garcia, who plays the ruthless casino owner, Terry Benedict, was superb because I haven't seen Garcia act in a while, and this is kind of a comeback for him. And last, but not least, Julia Roberts. What do I think about Julia? Well...Julia was absolutely great as Tess, Clooney's ex-wife! In conclusion, &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot; is slick, fast, and funny! This is George Clooney's best film since &quot;Out of Sight&quot;. Brad Pitt's best film since &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot;. Matt Damon's best film since &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;. Julia Roberts' best film since &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; and &quot;The Mexican&quot;. And Andy Garcia's best film since &quot;Desperate Measures&quot;. &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot; is, truly, one of the best action-comedies ever made in the year 2001. It is so hilarious, so hip, that you'll want to see it again and again!</p></body></html>

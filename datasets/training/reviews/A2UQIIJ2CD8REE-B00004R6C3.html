<meta name="summary" content="It's a John Carpenter Thing"></head><body><p>In the silent cold of an Antarctic wasteland, the United States National Science Institute's Station 4 team is about to encounter a horror from beyond our galaxy. Frozen for hundreds of thousands of years, dug up and released by a nearby Norwegian research team, and now, set loose in the confines of Station 4's isolated outpost, the life-form absorbing, perfectly imitating alien creature could be disguised as anyone, man or animal. Kurt Russell is R. J. MacReady, the helicopter pilot forced into the role of leader by circumstances out of his control. As the mysterious, faceless creature assimilates member after member, it's up to MacReady and the other survivors to discover who is really who they say they are. Paranoia is the order of the day, fear and tempers boil, and each friend and coworker begins to trust each other less and less.  Finger pointing and blame throwing are added into the mix, as the ever growing death toll begins to include victims of suspicion as well. It's anyone's guess how the confrontation will end, but this much is certain: It's a hell of a thing!<br /><br />In 1982, one heck of a year for Sci-Fi, John Carpenter graced us with yet another of his sci-fi/horror masterpieces, this one a remake of 1951's "The Thing From Another World," and simply titled: "The Thing." I use the term "remake" loosely, because in fact this new film was more strongly based on the original John Campbell short story, "Who Goes There?," than the first film had ever been. In "The Thing," John Carpenter achieves his objective of creating an alien creature that is never just a "guy in a suit." When not in disguise, this completely unknown creature is a hodgepodge of every life-form it's ever imitated, and the visuals are more than a little disturbing. Naturally, "The Thing" is chock full of special effects, mainly from FX master Rob Bottin, though Stan Winston kicked in some help too. For its time, the film pushed the boundaries of gore and horror. This movie isn't all about slimy alien invasions though. More than anything, it's about isolation, desperation, and paranoia. It's a fantastic, character driven story with an all male ensemble cast, featuring Carpenter favorites like Kurt Russell and Keith David, and other notables, such as Wilford Brimley and Richard Masur. John Carpenter's presence is evident throughout, but the haunting music is the dead giveaway. The collector's edition DVD is well laden with  informative extras, despite being a single disc. The effectively eerie slip cover is also a nice touch. Featured on the disc is an 80 minute behind the scenes documentary loaded with interviews and great footage. There are plenty of other treats too, including outtakes, deleted footage, galleries and slide-shows, and the expected theatrical trailer. There's also a great commentary with director John Carpenter and star Kurt Russell! Without a doubt, "The Thing" is a sci-fi classic and should be considered a necessary and welcome addition to any sci-fi/horror fan's library.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A High Quality Thriller"></head><body><p>Collateral offers a gripping storyline, excellent acting and direction and a lot of edge-of-your-seat excitement that doesn't falter in the least bit (although it's nearly a 2 hour movie which isn't common anymore.) Just from the moment Collateral started I was glued to the screen. This film's taut atmoshpere, great dialogue, and great acting from Foxx and Cruise makes this an extremely watchable thriller.<br />Jamie Foxx plays Max, an LA cab driver who inadvertently gets involved with the murders of 5 people from a hitlist being carried out by a contract killer named "Vincent" played by Tom Cruise. I won't go into details, but this storyline is executed very well and doesn't get confusing or complicated at all like what happens with a lot of films of this nature.<br />And there can't be enough said about the performances from Foxx and Cruise in this one. Playing almost parallel-like characters (Max a hard working man trying to make ends meet who values people and their company, Vincent a contract killer who values no one's life) made watching Foxx and Cruise on the screen a very interesting thing to watch. Plus to see Cruise playing a character such as this was a breath of fresh air in his career in my opinion.<br />Great thrills, a lot of excitement and some really great acting makes Collateral a film I would recommend.</p></body></html>

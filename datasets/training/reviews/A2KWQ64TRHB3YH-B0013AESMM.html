She is traumatized at first and even fearful of leaving her apartment. She gathers courage, finds out that the police are unable to help her, and buys a gun for protection against the many New York criminals. Several events follow in which she uses her gun and discovers the depths of her personality.<br /><br /> She is in a grocery store when a man shoots the clerk and wants to kill her so that she would not identify him. She kills him in self defense and leaves the store without letting anyone know what she did. She is surprised that she feels no anguish over the killings. Soon thereafter, on a subway, she is attacked by two men who she shoots and kills. She wonders if<br />She should have warned the men instead of shooting so quickly. What, she thinks, is this telling her about herself? Then, while out walking, she saves a prostitute from a pimp by threatening him with her gun. The pimp follows her and tries to run her down. She finds that she can calmly stand and shoot him through his car window as his car races to kill her.<br /><br />Police ballistics reveals that all the killings are related. Newspapers begin to speak about vigilante killings. Will she now seek revenge for the murder of her fianc&eacute;e? How will she do it? Will the police discover that she is the killer? Will they prosecute her?</p></body></html>

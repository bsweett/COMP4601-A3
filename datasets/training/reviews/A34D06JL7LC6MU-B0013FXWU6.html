It would be to bold of me to call this one of the decade's best films, but what director Paul Thomas Anderson has created with There Will Be Blood is a big, grand film rarely seen today with a towering performance by its star Daniel Day-Lewis.<br /><br />I do not need to divulge the plot to you. Day-Lewis plays oilman Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano plays fire-and-brimstone preacher Eli Sunday. I could describe the plot for you, but it's unnecessary, not simply because you likely already know about it but because this is a film that is not about plot...It's about evoking time, character, and emotions. No dialogue is spoken in the film for the first 14 minutes and it's remarkable what Anderson is able to express simply through images.<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson, never without ambition, was at his most ambitious with this film. Working with a vast landscape and a brilliant cinematographer (Robert Elswit, who won an Academy Award for his work here), Anderson easily evokes the early 1900s that a man like Plainview would inhabit and he doesn't mind taking a moment to linger on the vast setting he's working with. Jonny Greenwood's musical score is so unique and fits this film so well; it's larger-than-life, epic, and sinister. Anderson immerses his audience so completely into this time, this atmosphere, and it's Greenwood's score dictates the mood...It's masterfully made, but it's not just the workings behind the camera that made this film receive its acclaim.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis won his second Academy Award for this film and rarely has an actor delivered a screen performance of this caliber. This is a performance that transcends mere acting, where Day-Lewis is (and not for the first time) not just playing Daniel Plainview but becoming the man. It's much more of a transformation than a performance and it's one of the more fascinating performances I've ever seen. The voice, mannerisms, and the insanity he's capable of expressing with a single look is remarkable. Hardly anything Day-Lewis brings to this character suggests he's acting and it's no small feat to make such a towering, larger-than-life figure wholly believable and real. Who else could have brought such intensity and believability to the "milkshake" speech?<br /><br />Dano is effective too as both Paul Sunday and Eli Sunday and he stands his ground against Day-Lewis. There isn't a weak link anywhere in the performances, but it's Day-Lewis' show and he keeps his stranglehold on it throughout.<br /><br />There Will Be Blood is only three years old, but it can already be evaluated as timeless. There's such a grand scope of creative vision at work here that the film's faults (if it has any) can't be picked up on with the naked eye. The film is a masterpiece, one that grows richer with repeat viewings and it's one of the few films I know will still be watched and discussed thirty years from now.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

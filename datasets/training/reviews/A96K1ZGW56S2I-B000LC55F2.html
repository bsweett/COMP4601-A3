<meta name="summary" content="Which Witch is Which?"></head><body><p>Set mostly in turn of the 19th Century London, THE PRESTIGE is a magical movie about two rival magicians who become engrossed in a lifelong contest of one-upmanship between each that results in death and destruction.  Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Bordon (Christian Bale) are two apprentice magicians who work under the same manager, Mr. Harry Cutter (Michael Caine).  Angier and Bordon are both plants in the audience for a trick for another magician that involves tying his beautiful assistant up and lowering her into a locked huge container of water. The female assistant, Julia (Piper Perabo), also happens to be the wife of Angier.  Bordon has been instructed numerous times to tie the knots on her hands a certain way, but he insists on using a different knot that looks better, but is more difficult to unravel.  After one such performance, Julia is unable to untangle herself and ends up drowning in the tank.  As a result, Cutter, Angier, and Bordon all find themselves out of work and the friendship between Angier and Bordon becomes a hated rivalry.  Angier swears revenge, but after getting it isn't satisfied and goes on to steal one of Bordon's tricks.  Back and forth the rivalry rages.  It leads Angier to Colorado Springs and a meeting with famed inventor Nikola Tesla (David Bowie).  Eventually, Angier returns to London for the final showdown between the two magicians.  One is an illusionist, the other a true wizard.  So, which witch is which?<br /><br />I found THE PRESTIGE to be an enthralling movie that deserves multiple viewings.  Christopher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, have done an excellent job of adapting Christopher Priest's original novel.  Film is a different medium than a novel and the Nolan's know that well.  The movie is different than the book, but keeps to the spirit of the book, retaining all of the suspense and intrigue of the novel without giving anything away. Christopher Nolan uses some of the same filmmaking storytelling techniques he used in MEMENTO in THE PRESTIGE to keep the audience guessing exactly what is going on.  The Nolan brothers also did a good job of making the characters of Algier and Borden to be both sympathetic and despicable; there are times when you feel compassion towards each of the characters, but what they do in their obsession to out do each other shows everyone just how cold-hearted they really are.<br /><br />Bale and Jackman are at the top of their game as the rival showmen, while Caine gives a solid supporting performance as the man who assists both magicians during their deepest trials.  Piper Perabo doesn't have much screen time, but I felt she was perfect as Julia.  Scarlett Johansson portrays Olivia Wenscombe, the woman that both magicians fall in love with.  Johansson is a very attractive woman and one of the most-in-demand actresses in Hollywood right now.  However, I felt that out of all of the actors in the movie Johansson gives the most lackluster performance.  Olivia has a central (though unwitting) role in the plot, but Johansson seems to have approached it as she does most of her roles, as a vixen who seems more interested in sleeping with different men and breaking up marriages, and doesn't really do much acting.  The surprise performance in this film is that of David Bowie.  Bowie portrays Nikola Tesla.  David Bowie is one of the great rock musicians, but throughout his life he has acted in several different films.  His performance here is the best of his acting career.  I did not recognize Bowie at all and gives a perfect performance as the man who rivaled Edison.<br /><br />THE PRESTIGE doesn't really raise or address any socio-economic questions (though it does touch upon the ultimate science question, just because you can do something does that mean you should do it).  It's not necessarily a deep-thinking movie, though the movie does cause one to think.  It's a very entertaining film that doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't.  It is an incredible movie at what it does do and for that it's one of the best films to be released in 2006.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg's best since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"></head><body><p>A true story from director Steven Spielberg based on the autobiograpical book by Frank Abagnale Jr (Played here by Leonardo DiCaprio), CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is an entertaining, if somewhat overlong movie of the young con man who had successfully passed himself off as a pilot, pediatrician and Attorney General of Louisiana in addition to being wanted for fraud in 50 states: all before his 19th birthday!<br />The movie opens with Abagnale and two imposters pretending to be him on a TV game show, then the story begins in flashback mode (#1). FBI Agent Carl Handratty (Tom Hanks) had his first face to face encounter with Abagnale when Abagnale was imprisoned in France in 1969, after several years attempting to capture him. After being arrested and place on the plane Abagnale begins telling his story to Handratty which leads Spielberg to get tricky and start flashback #2. (Confused? I was at first). This starts the real story of Frank's escapades at Xmas 1963 with Frank watching his father Frank Sr (Christopher Walken) receive a doctorate. As it turns out Dad was also the one who taught Jr the art of scamming: The earliest example is when Frank successfully poses as a substitute French teacher at his own school! Of course along the way he assumes the identities of a Doctor, Lawyer and Pediatrician conning his way to immense wealth and throwing Hanratty off his trail numerous times- even posing as a Secret Service agent trying to help Hanratty!<br />But then as happens in life, Frank meets a wonderful girl and falls in love so soon he is grappling with the idea of telling her the truth about who he really is; and then risking being arrested and being separated from the woman he loves.<br />Sure, the story is pretty basic; but CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is still a highly enjoyable and fascinating movie which manages to maintain viewer interest for its full two hours plus running time. Though Leonardo doesn't portray a broad acting range at the best of times he's pretty good here. So is Hanks, but I found it annoying that he recycles his GREEN MILE accent for this character. That's my only quibble. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is easily Spielberg's best movie since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, although as I mentioned earlier his time juggling may confuse first time viewers. Martin Sheen plays Frank's future father-in-law.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The goal is to win the last game of the season!"></head><body><p>It's Oct 15, 2001 and General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) has just watched his Oakland A's team lose in the American League Division finals. That defeat hurts but now he is losing his best team players, the stars, to teams like the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Socks at salaries that his cash poor team cannot begin to match!<br /><br />The question is, "How do you beat big money?"<br /><br />While in meetings with his scouting agents, he listens to them about all of the prospects that they are recommending. While he hears about baseball skills he also hears about "handsome faces" and "ugly girlfriends". He realizes that baseball scouting is not the panacea to solve his biggest problem. How do you build a winning team with a limited budget?<br /><br />While out trying to trade players he meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) who is a Yale economics graduate working for the Cleveland Indians. He learns that young Peter is a man who has no baseball experience but is listened to by the management of the Indians. He hires him and finds out that Pete has developed a mathematical relationship between baseball players and their skills and how to match those skills to a team to win games. Billy's goal is to win the last game of the season! The World Series!<br /><br />What develops is that Billy and Pete rebuild the Oakland A's with a bunch of misfits that nobody else wants and tries to build a winning team. The team's field coach fights them every step of the way.<br /><br />This is based on a true story about how these guys' vision of professional baseball reworked the model that is used today to build championship teams.</p></body></html>

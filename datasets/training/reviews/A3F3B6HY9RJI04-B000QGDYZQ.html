So, the best I can say about this is that it is watchable.<br /><br />This isn't so much a time-travel movie, just a time-error movie.  Sandra Bullock plays a woman who lives one of her weeks out of order.  She wakes up on a Thursday and is told by the Sheriff that her husband is dead.  However, after grieving she goes to bed and wakes up earlier in the week only to find him alive.  She thinks she only dreamed the previous day and it takes a few days for her to realize that her days are out of order.<br /><br />This story could have been better.  The underlying story line is that the husband dies as he is headed out to have an affair.  So, does she let him die or does she try to save him?<br /><br />The biggest problem is that there are soooo many inconsistencies.  The biggest were some cuts on a girl's face.  This ended up occurring on the Tuesday of that week yet she lives through an entire Thursday where she didn't have cuts.  Sandra Bullock's mother is concerned because she doesn't know how the girl was cut but there were enough witnesses to the account to have told her the truth.  There was one day that started off repeating another day so I'm wondering if the writers were confused... tryng to write a new version of Groundhog's Day but instead changing it to a miss-step in time instead without changing the fundamentals of the story.<br /><br />And that is not all, but I think you get the idea:<br /><br />Flaws, flaws, flaws.  Some I can forgive but this movie was riddled with them and it just destroyed it for me and took all the enjoyment out of it.  There was so much more potential than a house-wife losing his man to another girl.  Come on!!  The writers could have come up with something better than this!<br /><br />Watchable at best, a complete time-travel flop at worst.<br /><br />Oh, it is beautiful in blu-ray.  If you have the option, watch it in that if you want to catch this movie.</p></body></html>

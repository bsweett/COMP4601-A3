<meta name="summary" content="well that was certainly a mistake"></head><body><p>Jeepers Creepers had so much potential but the director and I suppose, the producer blew it. What was that dialog about the mother all about at the begining? It went nowhere. The plot holes are just too big to forgive. If someone runs you off the road what do you do? You call the cops on your cell phone or you drive off and report it later. The brother and sister in this movie decide to go check the "guy" who nearly killed them out. You see the weird dude who nearly killed you stuffing what looks like a body into a pipe. What do you do? Get the heck out of there, right? No...these idiots decide to investigate.  Obviously the brother and sister had to run into the Creeper some kind of way to get the movie started but this was simply idiotic.<br />The Creeper does this every 23 years, so how come no one in town seems to have noticed missing loved ones? In fact, how come the folks in town don't just go on vacation during the Creeper's feeding time?<br />The Creeper himself is a scary creature until you see all of him then he becomes a laughable special effect. Okay, I'll admit that the last iamge of the movie was impressive but that's five minutes in an otherwise dopey movie.</p></body></html>

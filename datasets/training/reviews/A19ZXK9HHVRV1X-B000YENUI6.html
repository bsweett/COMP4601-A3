<meta name="summary" content="A Promise Largely Fulfilled"></head><body><p>For most of his career, cinema maverick David Cronenberg has been content to make films on the far-off, outer margins of the commercial mainstream.  It's only natural then that he would one day feel the need to come in from the cold (at least for awhile) and get a taste of what life is like for those on the inside.  He began that effort a few years back with "A History of Violence," a fairly straightforward movie that earned him a measure of success at the box office and a great deal of respect from both the critical establishment and his fellow directors.  Now, he continues the mainstreaming process with "Eastern Promises," a riveting but largely conventional crime drama that serves as a showcase for a half-a-dozen or so brilliant performances.  And if the movie feels as if it is lacking in the kind of originality, passion and uniqueness of vision we`ve come to expect from Cronenberg, well, there are certainly enough compensatory virtues to make the film very much worth seeing.<br /><br />Set in London, the movie takes us into the dark, frightening underworld of the Russian mafia.  Viggo Mortensen plays Nikolai Luzhin, a recent Russian immigrant working as a chauffeur for a mob boss who uses the respectability of a high-end restaurant as a cover for his nefarious deeds.  Naomi Watts co-stars as Anna, a local midwife who stumbles upon the diary of a 14-year old girl who has just died in childbirth, a diary that could implicate the old man on charges of rape, drug-dealing and child endangerment.  This knowledge puts Anna's life and the lives of her family at risk, so the question becomes will Nikolai side with his boss or with this innocent woman who is, ever so slowly, finding her way into his heart.<br /><br />In "Eastern Promises," Cronenberg abandons the over-the-top, absurdist elements that used to define the director's work, and settles for a more straightforward approach instead.  That is not meant to in any way denigrate the movie, for it is an intriguing tale that isn't afraid to take its time unraveling its story.  Cronenberg maintains a surprisingly low-keyed tone throughout, confident that tension can sometimes be achieved more effectively through understatement than through hyperbole.  Steve Knight's dialogue is flavorful and pungent, and he is blessed with a first-rate cast who clearly knows how to deliver the lines he`s written.  Mortensen, sporting a thick Russian accent, creates a menacing presence through his sturdy demeanor and stoic expression.  Yet, he allows glimmers of tenderness to occasionally seep out from the edges of his half-smile or the center of his piercing eyes.  Armin Mueller-Stahl provides a similarly discomfiting mixture of grandfatherly gentleness and steely-eyed ruthlessness as the Old World mob boss who is anything but the benign, kindly restaurateur he portrays himself as being.  Vincent Cassell as his overcompensating son, Naomi Watts as the compassionate Anna, and Sinead Cusack and Jerzy Skolimowski as Anna's concerned mother and uncle all deliver compelling, memorable performances.<br /><br />Thus, even though I prefer Cronenberg when he's stirring up trouble way out there on the fringe in cutting-edge movies such as "Crash" or "Spider," there are still many good reasons for checking out "Eastern Promises."</p></body></html>

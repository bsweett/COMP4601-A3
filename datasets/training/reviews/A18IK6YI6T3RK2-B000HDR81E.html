<meta name="summary" content="JEN AND VINCE FELL IN LOVE MAKING THIS MOVIE?!"></head><body><p>This movie had its moments, i thought Jennifer Aniston was very good in this.  Im usually not a big fan of hers, but I like her in this, granted, I just could not buy that a women so put together and hot would into shlubby Vince Vaughn, the guy looks like Frankenstein.  Some of the movie did not jive, like when she gets what she wants from him and her feelings have changed? It just seemed really abrupt, he had come a long ways with what he says to her..they also fight very nasty, I just dont think you can say the things that they say to each other and salvage anything, that's sorta slash and burn, and the end was sorta like..uh, ok..hummm...overall, not a great movie, but like I said Aniston is good and maybe worth a rent from netflix, but i would not buy it..i would not care to watch this again, once was quite enough.</p></body></html>

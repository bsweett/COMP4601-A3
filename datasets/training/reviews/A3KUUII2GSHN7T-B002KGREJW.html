<meta name="summary" content="Portrait of a quirky, loyal American family."></head><body><p>Here they come now. One is wearing a 'Jesus was wrong' t-shirt while his eyes burn with hatred for everything around him, another is a suicidal scholar who is still getting over a failed relationship, and their leader: a self-help guru who just can't seem to help himself. These are some of the faces that make up the Hoover clan as they attempt to get their yellow van moving back down the highway by first pushing it. Their destination  is the Little Miss Sunshine competition in Redondo Beach,  California.<br /><br />Olive, the young, slightly overweight daughter of the Hoovers who has earned a spot in the competition, is the principle character here. She seems to be the force that brings this eclectic family unit together, and it is through her that all the members of the Hoover family find commonality and loyalty toward once another.<br /><br />Perhaps the wittiest film of 2006, Little Miss Sunshine is at times vulgar and will make you squirm a bit, but the subject matter is all about the fine trimmings of family and the message is clear during the last, nutty segments of the film, "Family is family, and you've only got one, so get over your differences and DANCE, baby!"</p></body></html>

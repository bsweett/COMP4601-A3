The film has Tim Burton written all over it, but to my knowledge he had nothing to do with this sinister little film. I'm a sucker for Stop Motion Animation and 'Coraline ' delivers some excellent visuals that might put the little ones(under 10)in your bed every night for weeks after seeing it.  I bought the Blu Ray set and it looks and sounds fantastic, but the 3-D is disappointing as the color seems to be very off or washed out. I haven't seen any 3-D films that look right in my home, so maybe it's my home theater equipment? If you're a fan of stop motion animation and things that are macabre, then you should love the setting in this wicked little movie.</p></body></html>

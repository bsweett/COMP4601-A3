The story is a beautiful mix of reality and fantasy - the reality being the grim Spanish Civil War that was grinding on in the remote areas of Spain in 1944 and the secret world of fairies and the faun inhabited by Ofeila.  The story of the film has been well told by other reviewers so let me say how remarkable the performance of Ivana Baquero as Ofeila is.  She was described in an article about the film as being 10 going in 40 (she is 12) and her maturity comes through in her remarkable performance of a demanding role.  Doug Jones (Abe Sapiens in Hellboy) is spectacular as the faun and the menacing pale man who sees with his hands.  Mr. Jones has a remarkable ability to play creatures and imbue them with life; he was completely believable as a faun from the first moment.  Sergi Lopez makes an effective Capitan Vidal, the true monster of the story and Maribel Verdu makes a great heroine as Mercedes. The casting of the supporting roles was impeccably done with Alex Angulo (just to name one performance) especially good as Dr. Ferreiro.<br /><br />In the end, one is not sure whether to be full of joy or cry; the audience is allowed to decide if Ofelia has fulfilled her destiny and become a princess or if she has been senselessly murdered. Guillermo Del Toro has once again shown that is a great storyteller, and this is a story that can be explored at many levels.  Pan's Labyrinth is a feast for the eyes and a thought provoking story that will stay with you and one that I am looking forward to seeing again.</p></body></html>

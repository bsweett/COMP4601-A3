<meta name="summary" content="A Life in Parallel - or is it?"></head><body><p>SOURCE CODE (dir. Duncan Jones, 2011, 93 minutes AND I WILL POSSIBLY SPOIL THIS WITHOUT INTENTION) is an ocean of fun, Hitchcockian suspense and metaphysics, unbearable tension, extreme silliness - all this meant as a wrapping for some deep moral dilemmas.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays Captain Colter Stevens, an experimental subject (with an emphasis on the "mental"). He is meant to retrieve as much data as possible to find a bomber who is heading toward Chicago. The trouble is, he is supposed to find this bomber, if he can, in the past. This is a reboot of GROUNDHOG DAY, 13 MONKEYS, TRON and any other similarly great, silly films. A really good clue: this film is very reminiscent of an old "Star Trek: The Next Generation" episode called "A Matter of Perspective", episode 62, 3rd season, in which Cmdr. Riker is accused of murder, and a hologram reconstruction of the crime is carefully studied. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6303406378">Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 62: A Matter Of Perspective [VHS</a>])<br /><br />The problem as I see it is an immense, unnecessary flaw in the story and plot. The film seems like time travel. It isn't. It also seems like it's communication with the dead. Well, almost. The flaw is that this movie vacillates between two mutually annihilating stories/technologies. It is impossible to reconcile them unless you decide time's components themselves are parallel universes. Even then, better to avoid bogging the movie down with too much thinking. They even tell Capt. Stevens that in the film.<br /><br />No surprise, then, that this occasionally bass-ackward movie stands its manifold messages on their heads, which is the brilliant fun of it. From the uselessness of contacting the dead to help us, to the little value we place on our soldiers while asking them to sacrifice it all. From the hysteria of preventing terrorism to the hysteria of becoming the most famous savior of the world. From secret government projects to playing God. It's all here, and it is spooky. Hitchcock, Kurosawa and Gilliam did this kind of thing much better - yet they would never have dreamt of trying what SOURCE CODE accomplishes.<br /><br />With the brilliant talents of Jeffrey Wright as Dr. Rutledge and Vera Farmiga as Captain Colleen Goodwin, a PLANET OF THE APES soundtrack and non-stop action, this instant classic cannot be missed. In spite of the migraine I obtained by thinking out all the stupid things they did with the logic here, I loved it. Took away a star for the migraine, thanks a lot Hollyweird ....</p></body></html>

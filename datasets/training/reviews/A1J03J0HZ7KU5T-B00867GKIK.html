<meta name="summary" content="A Pixar Masterpiece"></head><body><p>Once in a while, a film emerges as an instant classic that cannot be disputed. Pixar's "Up" (2009) is such a masterwork - a gloriously imaginative adventure for viewers old and young. Colorful yet unpretentious, this animated feature puts Hollywood's brain-dead commercialism to shame. Senior traveler Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) remains an unforgettable creation. The finest Pixar production to date and a textbook example of great filmmaking.</p></body></html>

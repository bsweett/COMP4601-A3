"The Day After Tomorrow" is Sir Anthony Hopkins or "Gone With the Wind" compared to that.<p>The point of all of that is, much more than books, I believe we go to the movies just to be entertained. Pure and simple. Sometimes we are overwhelmed by the craft of the actors; sometimes a small film of which we didn't expect much rocks our world; color; cinematography; costumes; music. All of these things become food for our mind.<p>So what are we seeing "The Day" for? To be rocked. Special effects. Giant waves. Tornadoes on Rodeo Drive. It's a trip. Even the film that Mr. Emmerich is always complimented on, "Independance Day," is just a fun trip. That's why we buy into it. Because we don't have to take it seriously. It's like rock 'n roll. 100 years from now they'll still be listening to Bach and Mozart and Puccini. Do you really think they're going to be playing 'Stairway to Heaven' at Carnegie Hall? Do you think we'll be quoting the lyrics from Journey or Creed? <p>I enjoyed the heck out of this movie. It did everything it promised to do for me. It was a ride on the Roller Coaster at Coney Island when I was a kid. That's all it said it was going to be, and it delivered. Larry Scantlebury. 4 Stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="There's a reason you've never heard of this movie..."></head><body><p>Reading many of the one-two star reviews pretty much sums up my feelings. The character development just isn't there. Anthony Hopkins, my fave actor "ever" is barely seen and when he is it feels like "Instinct" all over again. The worst part of the movie is with the "tuh-duh" moment (such as it is) of the movie in which the writer and director made the absolute least out of the mathematical theory written in the notebook; it just wasn't presented in a way that made it the least bit interesting to the audience. *Spoiler: And the part about the father/daughter handwriting looking the same because they spent a lot of time with each other actually made me LAUGH!<br /><br />Thankfully I only rented this from Netflix, and I suggest you do the same. Proof is just a watered down version of a Beautiful Mind mixed with a high profile cast that prove sleepwalking and acting at the same time is possible.</p></body></html>

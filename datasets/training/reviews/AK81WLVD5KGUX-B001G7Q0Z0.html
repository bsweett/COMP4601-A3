<meta name="summary" content="Better than the book, the rest of the series, and the remake"></head><body><p>Pierre Bouelle's novel was good; the rest of the movie series ranged from okay to abysmal, and the remake was adequate (and arguably more faithful to the novel). But the 1968 version of _Planet of the Apes_ is just one of those _great_ moments in SF film history that nothing else can touch.<p>Charlton Heston is magnificent in the first of his three well-known 'last man' movies (the other two being _The Omega Man_ and _Soylent Green_, which are also nonrepeatable classics). The makeup is excellent, especially for 1968. But it's the brilliant script (for which Rod Serling shares a co-credit) that raises this film to its iconic status.<p>This is the sort of thing that 1960s cinematic SF (including the original _Star Trek_ series) tried to pull off and rarely managed to succeed at. This film is a carefully constructed drama, a meditation on human nature, and a two-hour morality play -- backed by a wonderfully evocative Jerry Goldsmith score. The 'science' in its science fiction is nothing to write home about, but its digs at human culture, religion, and species-centered pride work every bit as well today as they did in the latter portion of the turbulent '60s. <p>On the off-chance that there's somebody out there who doesn't know how it ends -- despite the fact that (duhh) a shot from the _final scene_ appears on the DVD cover -- I won't describe the Big Finale. But man, oh, man, even when you _know it's coming_, Heston still pulls it off. The closing moments _never_ fail to grab me.<p>And this mind-wrenching ending was specifically created for this film. It's not in the book and it's not in the remake.<p>The widescreen-format DVD is nicely done. If it's not in your collection already, get it at once.</p></body></html>

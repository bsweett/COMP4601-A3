<meta name="summary" content="Apollo 13  (1995)"></head><body><p>Director:  Ron Howard<br /><br />Cast:  Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Emily Ann Lloyd, Miko Hughes, Max Elliot Slade.<br /><br />Running Time:  140 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG for language and emotional intensity.<br /><br />Director Ron Howard's emotionally draining "Apollo 13" surrounds the near-disaster which surrounded NASA's Ill-fated 3rd Mission to the moon. After two landings on the moon the missions had become almost commonplace and public interest in the space program was beginning to wane. This changed at 03:06 UT on 14 April 1970 when a malfunction in a heating coil caused an oxygen tank to explode, severely damaging the service module. The damage was so extensive that it forced the abandonment of the moon-landing and the severely compromised the ability of Astronauts Captain James Lovell (Tom Hanks), John L Swigert (Bill Paxton) and Fred Haise (Kevin Bacon) to return home, a task they were able to accomplish only by jury-rigging their available equipment under the direction of Houston and suffering cold temperatures before they were able to successfully renter the Earths atmosphere in their spacecraft.  Using computer graphics, the infamous "Vomit Comet", and realistic sets, this movie conveys what it was like aboard an Apollo spacecraft. The liftoff is breathtaking, with multiple views of the size and grandeur of the Saturn V rocket. Inside the spacecraft one sees the benefits (and drawbacks) of weightlessness. There's even a simulator in which the astronauts train for maneuvers they must perform during the mission. The movie is a "behind-the-scenes" look at the NASA space program in the 1960's and 1970's, giving all those not present at the time an idea of what it must have been like.<br /><br />Tom Hanks makes for a very effective choice as Jim Lovell. The way he tries to keep up the spirits of his crew while trying to mastermind the success of getting back to Earth is tremendously entertaining. His best scene is when they are going past the Moon, and can't land on it. Haise and Swigert are by the windows craning to get a good look, but Jim prefers to use his imagination. His sadness is profound and moving.  Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon also put in some stellar support, especially the scene where they start arguing with each other about whose fault it is why the oxygen tank exploded. You could sometimes cut the tension of those scenes with a knife.  Back on Earth, we have Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, Ed Harris as Gene Kranz, and Kathleen Quinlan as Marilyn Lovell. Ken has to work around the clock putting together a procedure that will enable the space shuttle to reenter the Earth's atmosphere.  Ed Harris is almost pitch perfect as Gene Kranz and was robbed of a Best-Supporting Actor Oscar.  Although some of his lines of dialogue are very "all American", he is still very rousing as the head of Mission Control.  Kathleen Quinlan is a talented actress to be sure, but she doesn't get a great deal to do in this film. All she can do is watch and wait for her husband's shuttle to return home. She still gives it all she's got, and it would be hard to imagine the film without her.  Director Howard has assembled a superb ensemble cast, and has a decent script to work from. Everybody should know the basic story by now but this fact is impressively never allowed to destroy dramatic tension. No one with any sense would label Howard an auteur, and this works well for "Apollo 13" because it allows us to concentrate on the individuals in front of the camera rather than the guy behind it.  The moods in this picture are impressively judged, the historic build up (which admittedly does drag slightly), the perilous middle and the triumphant end. The effects are superb, but they aren't the only thing here, making this a true blockbuster with soul.  A true Hollywood feel-good production and one of the better films of the year.</p></body></html>

Now it was kinda sorta on my list anyway.  I do like Tim Burton, at least the Tim Burton films that I've seen, and I do like Johnny Depp in most things I've seen him in.  And I read enough Roald Dahl back in the day to know that this would likely be as dark a children's film as you were going to get.  So if it couldn't be said I was desperate to see the film, I was certainly intrigued.<br /><br />Almost as soon as the movie began, I remembered the key reason why it's always a good idea to try to catch Burton's films on the big screen.  The look of them is always impressive--grandiose actually.  And whether you're talking Willy Wonka's factory or Gotham City, you really want the full effect of those visuals.  They remind you of why it's such a shame that the word "awesome" has been cheapened in recent years and now just means something like "really cool."<br /><br />But there's still "awe inspiring" and Burton's visual sense is certainly that.  The initial scenes of Charlie's crooked, dilapidated house and the huge city that surrounds it are as Dahl-esque as you can hope for.  They're almost DALI-esque, in fact.  You almost wonder why such well regarded actors as Helena Bonham Carter, David Kelly and Noah Taylor would be so eager to take roles in a project in which they would be playing second fiddle to the special effects.  For his part, however, it's easy to see why Johnny Depp would be drawn to the Willy Wonka role.  One of our quirkiest actors reteaming with the quirkiest of directors, well, it's almost a sure thing.<br /><br />Depp, we read time and time again, loves to take chances.  I'm sure he and Burton realized that by playing Wonka so affectlessly, they couldn't help but draw the Michael Jackson comparisons.  "Creepy" may be rapidly becoming an overused adjective in describing his performance here, but there you are. It's hard to think of a better one (except maybe "eerie").  If Depp and Burton didn't set out to evoke Jackson, then current events have overtaken their intentions.  But I suspect they did model some of Willy's vocal mannerisms on the Gloved One.  The paleness, the hair-do, and yes, the gloves also evoke Jackson as well. The key question is just how far along in development was this film when the most recent Jackson case broke.<br /><br />The parallels are certainly there.  But there are key differencews. In the world of cinema, someone who lost his childhood,and who has never experienced the warmth of a loving family, can successfully become whole even in his (supposed) adulthood.  In real life, that's not so easy.<br /><br />And there are other key differences between the fictional Wonka and what we know of the real-life Jackson.  Wonka's lack of solicitousness towards children is almost jarring, particularly if you're new to the story.  He does not seem eager to win their affection: in fact, he seems to be almost deliberately alienating. The harm he incurs on them is viewed as being somehow justified.  He is, in some ways, something of an avenging angel, giving these brats and their awful parents a well deserved comeuppance.<br /><br />Interestingly, he is not much warmer towards the deserving Charlie until the very end either.  If he's aware of Charlie's specialness, he is not quick to let on.  It is more likely that h fundamentally misreads Charlie and cannot begin to comprehend the latter's love of family. It all leads to an emotional reawakening on his part, at Charlie's instruction. Child is mentor to the man, as it were.<br /><br />Since I did see the movie at a matinee screening, there were a lot of kids in the audience.  One thing I did not sense was any giddy excitement on their part over what they had seen.  It's only a random sample, to be sure, but I couldn't help but wonder.<br />Is Burton's vision too dark for the kiddies?  Is there any real demographic for this film other than dyed-in-the-wool Tim Burton fans?  I'm not sure.  I had a few queasy moments viewing this film--you know, the sense of having eaten too much ice cream.<br /><br />Or chocolate.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="4 solid stars for a great story !"></head><body><p>It's the best movie I've seen all year "so far" at the movie theater.I actually enjoyed it more than Robert DeNiro's "Hide and Seek".<br /><br />Constantine ~ is a good movie.No there's not alot of action but alot of explaining about what's going on with Heaven & Hell.<br /><br />If anyone ever seen The Prophecy with Christoper Walken then you should know alittle bit more about Constantine and you would know "Gabriel" the angel is a renegade only doing things for his or herself.<br /><br />With all the movies relating to Satin , Heaven , Hell and Demons.I'd have to say Constantine is better than all.It wasn't scary or anything ,just a great story for a movie.You can't stick this movie next to The Exorcist , Halloween or Friday the 13th.<br /><br />Constantine falls , between Van Helsing but in 2005 and maybe alittle bit of End of Days since the influence of evil spreads throughout humans "mentally".<br /><br />Go and see this movie , there's nothing else out there to see yet.Next on my list is Boogeyman.Can't wait for Batman Begins in the summer.Also Fantastic Four comes out too this year.</p></body></html>

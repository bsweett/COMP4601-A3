<meta name="summary" content="Classic Horror Film"></head><body><p>These days, all "horror" movies are just full of blood instead of actual horror.  However, "The Shining" is filled with horror and it actually scared me, which is rare.  It is about a writer, Jack (Jack Nicholson), who decides to live in a hotel during the winter, with just his son and wife, and no one else in the hotel.  Jack's son can read minds and sense ghosts, which comes in handy because the hotel is filled with ghosts and supernatural beings.<p>  As time goes by, Jack starts to grow crazier and crazier, developing writer's block, while Jack's family is starting to fear him.  During their stay at this haunted hotel, the family is constantly scared by ghosts of people that were murdered in the hotel.  Also, later on, Jack tries to murder is family with an ax!  I am not goin to give away any more of the film, I will let you go and rent it yourself.  Any horror fan will love this one.</p></body></html>

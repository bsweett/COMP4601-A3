<meta name="summary" content="Thank You For Smoking"></head><body><p>Nick Naylor (Eckhart) works for the Academy of Tobacco Studies as a spin doctor.  He is their primary weapon in defense of Big Tobacco, and that is not an easy job.  Bribing the cancer stricken Marlboro Man (Elliot), making smoking sexy in movies, and spinning an expose about him are all on his agenda.  Through it all, he has to baby sit his son (Bright) and show him what dad does for a living.<br /><br />"Thank You For Smoking" is a funny, edgy movie.  Aaron Eckhart is perfect as the somewhat soulless Naylor.  His reasoning will make you cringe, but he is hard to argue with.  The supporting cast is star studded, and all the actors do a solid job.  Those on both sides of the smoking issue can enjoy this movie as well, and that is perhaps the most impressive trick that the movie pulls off.  If you are looking for a thought provoking, funny movie, this one is for you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A suspect DVD release for a classic film."></head><body><p>GoodFellas is on top of my "best films of all time" list.  I was one of the people who had bought the previous DVD edition, the infamous "two-sided, no features" release that had been one of the first generation of DVD releases, before the medium evolved into what it is today.  I had been counting the days until they would re-release this film, so I was first in line to get this new edition.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though this edition is much better than the previous one, it very much pales alongside most modern DVD packages.<br /><br />The package aroused many suspicions in me that this was a rush job.  Among my dissatisfactions:<br /><br />- There's no booklet, leaflet, film histories, or printed material of any kind which generally supplements a two-disc release like this;<br /><br />- The film is long, but still under the three-hour mark, and the second disc has three short (eight to 20 minutes), unremarkable documentaries plus a storyboard-film comparison.  Wouldn't all this material have fit on a single disc?  Dragon:  The Bruce Lee Story had three times the media and was only a single disc.  If they didn't have enough material, why did they put up the illusion that there are two discs' worth?<br /><br />- There are only two commentaries, and one of them isn't even complete.  The "Cop and Crook" commentary is interesting, applying the great idea of bringing back Henry Hill (on whose life this film and its source book Wiseguy were based) and the prosecutor who had sponsored his Witness Protection Program, Edward McDonald.  It's not a very illuminating commentary, but it's still good to see what Hill is like today.  However, the "Cast and Crew" commentary is suspect.  Not only does it not cover the entire film, I actually suspect it was not recorded as a commentary, but edited from fragmentary interviews.  So rarely do the cast and director on this track comment on the specific scenes, the way a commentary should, that I don't think they were watching the film as they were speaking; I think the production company simply mixed the sound louder and created the illusion that this was a commentary track.  I don't know for sure if this is the case, but if it is, I consider it very dishonest marketing.  Don't call it a commentary unless it is one!<br /><br />- I found absolutely no new insights into Martin Scorsese or the film from the additional materials.  The "making of" documentary is the usual "heap praise upon the director" baloney.  Come on, do we actually *need* you to tell us that Scorsese is great?  How about giving some anecdotes and insight into the film instead?<br /><br />All of the above adds up to a very underwhelming DVD release of a film that's possibly the greatest American film of the last 20 years.  However, there is still one incentive to own it -- the entire film is contained, without interruptions, on one disc.  So unlike with the old DVD release, you can actually watch the whole film now without having to turn the disc over.  So this is still the best available version of the film out there.  However, I remain displeased.  After years of waiting, and being disappointed, why does this edition fail to satisfy?<br /><br />I can only hope that the impossible would happen -- that Warner Bros. would let The Criterion Collection take a stab at this film, and do it justice.  It will never happen, but the very idea does whet the appetite.</p></body></html>

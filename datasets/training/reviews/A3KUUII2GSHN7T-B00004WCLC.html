<meta name="summary" content="Oh my GOOOOOOOOOSH! The best film I've seen in years!!"></head><body><p>I'm not naive. I'm not unrealistic. I'm tedious and overly critical when I watch films, looking and searching for flaws and agendas. This film, this Magnolia, was a piece of heavenly humanity on film. We see a number of seemingly all-together folks who need SOMETHING in all their lives to fill their various voids, their pains, their yearnings. This something comes together in many realistic ways but under the umbrella of a miraculous event at the end of the film.  <p>Each character has demons to answer to in this movie. For one man, his grievances come in the form of pushy parents who took his boyhood by making him focus singularly on winning a boy genius competion. Years later, when he is grown, another young boy must grow through the process of a selfishly pushy father who is always makes sure to say, "I love you" whenever talking to his son, even if his actions say otherwise. <p>There is a woman who's married a man for his money but later falls in love with him as he dies of cancer in his living room. The man's son, Tom Cruise, is living with his own pitfalls and attempts harboring his pain by playing the daily role of a extremely confident sex guru. "Tame her" is his theme and his following involves thousands of men with voids themselves. <p>There is a Christian cop who has the heart of a lamb but the insecurities of a psych patient. He falls for a crack-head who has ancient scars of her own to deal with. It is their relationship, in my opinion, that steals the show. <p>There are others, of course; a talk show host who has three months to live; a compassionate male nurse who attempts the reuniting of two bitterly astranged family members; a young black boy who - for the briefest of moments - manages to steal our hearts in a handsome display of well-being for his fellow man.  Despite their confident smiles and tones, each person in this film is deeply frail. Each wanders aimlessly through stormy torments but, luckily for all of them, hope and resolution rises firmly on the horizon.  <p>A stirring film with raw emotion and deep compassion. This film has plenty of vulgarities so be warned; however, without some of it, the truly humanistic style would fail to be portrayed. WATCH THIS FILM!! Engrossing, intriguing, thought-provoking and beautifully graceful, Magnolia is an emotional powerful film if there ever was one.  <p>The acting in this film is TOP NOTCH and so if the music. If you have three hours to spare, give this film a chance! TWO THUMBS WAY UP!</p></body></html>

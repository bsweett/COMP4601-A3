Last week I also had the pleasure in purchasing the soundtrack, and upon listening I felt almost trained enough to finally watch the movie, in what I call the preferred order: first I read the book, then listen to the score and then savor the movie.<br /><br />I will have to agree that certain key parts had to be squandered or sped up to fit the 500 page story into a movie that didn't cause an embolism; a blot clot form sitting too long. For that purpose I must say that reading the book filled my nooks and crannies of any doubts and lack of information the movie might have left out, but as I say the movie can stand solid on the ground with its own right, for those who do not wish to read the book.<br /><br />Before I read Da Vinci Code I heard that Tom Hanks will be cast as Robert Langdon, and I must say I was pleased with the choice and pleasantly surprised how a character who plays well in romantic comedies  and war movies pulled out such a human, caring, intelligent and attention absorbing role. Tom was a great Robert Langdon, walking through the pages as I read the book with him in mind, solving world's oldest puzzles, traveling form continent to continent and back to search out in the name of science what he believed in. I think all the main characters such as sweet yet strong Tautou, Reno played Fache right on, Bettany's Silas was haunted yet you couldn't stop looking at him, Aflried Molina as brief as his role, was very good and of course Ian McKellen as Teabing almost stole the whole show! But I must say, that Langdon stood very strongly in front of my eyes on the big screen and  he was transformed through the role into a real scholar, a truth seeker traveling with Sophie at his side, forming a bond of more than friendship; a run for his and her life on a quest to find the Grail. And for those who did not read the book, the movie does a great job of setting up the guilty suspect because there are some bad guys in this movie and half the fun on the trail of the Grail is figuring who they are and what exactly IS the grail. .<br /><br />I thought the movie followed main plot very closely, it even kept the jokes and historical references right on point in order to enrich the experience. I must ad the music, especially when Langdon was in the church finding the code for the cryptex through his memory of the solar system, going through any word that was the answer was insanely gorgeous. The ending song, Kyrie for Magdalene at the very end make all the hair on my body stand straight and left deep satisfaction for coming out and seeing it for myself. I really loved the ending as it was right on and the music was just perfect, rich, romantic, haunting and opulent.<br /><br />Lovely movie, that needs bit of an open mind and as I just read about rights being purchased for part II and III, I am impatiently waiting for any future sightings of Mr. Langdon for where he is hidden trails of adventure loom not too far ahead.</p></body></html>

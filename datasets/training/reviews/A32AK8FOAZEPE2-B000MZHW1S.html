<meta name="summary" content="compare to other so-so movies still got 4-star ratings"></head><body><p>this movie deserves 5 stars, even the ending sucks big time. the whole story is very intense and thrilling, it kept the audience sitting tight in their seats, not too many people left for the restrooms in the middle. decaprio did a great performance from a soldier of fortune to a born-again humanist who sacrificed himself for nothing. i am very glad that he finally looked pretty mature and indeed with genuine star quality. he should do more like this character instead of playing the image of a playboy. great performance of the other supporting actors too. the stunt, the fighting and massacre scenes were done great. only the editing needs to be more generous in cutting, not much but definitely needed.</p></body></html>

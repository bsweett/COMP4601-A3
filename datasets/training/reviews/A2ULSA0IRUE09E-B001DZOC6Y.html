<meta name="summary" content="Underrated & Engrossing : A Science-Fiction Film before its' Time"></head><body><p>"The Happening", like M. Night Shyamalan's superb "The Village", is yet another underrated film from a director, who has consistently produced one spectacular film after the other. I remain in the miniscule minority of people who actually liked "Lady in the Water", so perhaps you might want to keep that in mind before reading the rest of this review. Granted, some of his films are better than others. "Unbreakable", according to me, was a gigantic mis-step (though beautifully made), while "Signs" was a true blue masterpiece, and a classic in the science fiction genre.<br /><br />Which is why "The Happening" remains rather elusive and abstract, when held up against his back catalog. Its certainly science-fiction, especially since he predicts a world where our botanical friends overtake the universe and start killing humans, but the real twist is that nature eventually makes man completely self-destructive - not that we aren't already - to the point of voluntary suicide. Many of these suicides appear on-screen in rather graphic fashion - people walking in front of lawn-mowers, car accidents, jumping off buildings, shooting themselves - but they all feel rather plausible given the context.<br /><br />The only problem is with the casting, as Mark Wahlberg is actually a great actor who has had to 'dumb down' for a role such as this. This particular lead role requires the character to look 'continuously perplexed', and Wahlberg does so, but with a hint of irony and sarcasm, which I found rather disconcerting, especially since it seemed ill-fit in a film with rather serious undertones. Perhaps a bone-dead actor like Keanu Reeves would have done better here. I would have gone with Joaquin Phoenix, who stunned us all in "Signs" with his acting prowess.<br /><br />The Deschanel girl, who plays the lead female character, is a fine actress otherwise (and a fine musician as well), but her relationship with the main lead feels contrived and forced. Thankfully, this relationship doesn't form the base of the story, so we are pulled into the real issue of environmental mishap and the fury of the plant kingdom. Many critics have said that the lack of a perceptible 'villain' in this film, makes the entire outing seem weak and meandering. Well, that is in part true. Every Shyamalan film has had a true 'bad guy' in some form or the other, but here, the only villain is nature itself, and thats too vague of a concept to present on screen anyway. So we are treated of trees swaying in the breeze, etc, in the hope that we'd find this vision 'menacing' (all set to some dark violin music, of course). At times, this works well, and at others, not so much.<br /><br />"The Happening" is certainly an acquired taste. Alongwith "Unbreakable", its the least 'developed' film in the directors cannon, but its also riveting. I personally feel that its a bit ahead of its' time because its talking about issues that people feel are silly and ridiculous, which is why many of the episodes here seem unintentionally comical. Not so. With the right spirit and with a better understanding of whats happening in the world around us, this is easily a horror flick with the best thats out there.<br /><br />Certain characters, such as John Leguizamo, seem 'added on' with no actual benefit, but their presence makes sense a little down the film. Between the long 'escape sequences' and the truly harrowing scenes where the leads are trapped with a group in a field, wondering if they're going to die next, this is a superb commentary on science-fiction possibilities of the future on our planet. The climax, set in France, was especially interesting because it served as a warning of sorts.<br /><br />While you might have heard absolutely loathsome comments on "The Happening", it really is a little classic on its' own terms. The director knew what he was doing. There is a slow, fifteen minute portion of the film where the leads are hiding out in the house of a madwoman (played to perfection by Betty Buckley), but the mood of depression, solitude and impending insanity is captured so well. Watch it just for this long segment - its truly affecting.<br /><br />Four Stars. Not for everyone, but it clearly worked for me.</p></body></html>

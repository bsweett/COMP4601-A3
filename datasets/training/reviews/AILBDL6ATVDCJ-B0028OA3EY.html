The action is way too missing, though the action scenes that actually happened were very good.<br /><br />I liked the special effects in the film.  I liked half of the cast, hated the other half.  I liked half of the script, hated the other half.<br /><br />Lex Luthor is going to create a continent that is going to so upset the environment of the earth that almost all of North America will be destroyed, yet he is sitting right there on the beginnings of the new land mass?  Please, what kind of shallow writing is this?<br /><br />And exactly how can Lex Luthor have been paroled less than five years into a double-life sentence?  A parole hearing in less than five years?  Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaassseeeeeeee!  It's called a script, find one!<br /><br />I expected so much more.  How about a Lex Luthor who surrounds himself with people who are a little interesting!  How about a plot that the audience care about?<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was given little to work with in this movie.  They even resorted to bald jokes from kids?  Good grief!<br /><br />Kate Bosworth (Lois Lane) tries to save this movie from her first appearance to her last, but there is just no way to pull this film from its watery grave.<br /><br />I realize a lot of people liked this movie, and I understand people are going to differ when it comes to commenting on an end production.  But I doubt there is anyone who truly believes that the script and the length of the film could not have been improved.  Be honest.<br /><br />I saw this movie in a FULL theater, and other than a few "something just jumped out at you" moments, I did not hear anyone laugh, clap, or even respond to a single scene in the movie.<br /><br />Sorry I didn't think much of this movie, but I really didn't.<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></body></html>

The similarly titled 1972 all-star disaster epic was, after all, the definitive cinematic statement on phantom waves that turn an ocean liner upside down in the middle of the ocean.  But ever in the pursuit of quick bucks, Hollywood decided that remaking a film with a tweaked screenplay was more cost-efficient than commissioning a brand new script.<br /><br /> "Poseidon" is not a terrible film.  It's just a ho-hum, predictable one.  As you watch, you know that almost everyone aboard the massive ship will die horrible deaths, a small group will reach temporary safety only to expire along the way, while a few will make it to the final credits.  Therein, I guess, lies the suspense.  When "The Poseidon Adventure" was made thirty-four years ago, the filmmakers depended on elaborate, upside-down sets and huge miniatures to suggest the topsy-turvy disaster that unexpectedly befalls a cruise ship on New Year's Eve.  It was quite an impressive picture with some beloved old-timers in featured roles and, in the era of the big-budget disaster film, racked up a fortune at the box office.<br /><br /> The cast of characters is different this time around, but still registers "generic."  There's the suicidal businessman (Richard Dreyfuss) whose dive into the ocean to kill himself is interrupted by an enormous wave bearing down on the ship.  Rather than let the wave finish what he started out to do, he retreats into the grand ballroom.  There's the overly self-assured ship's captain (Andre Braugher) who assures the survivors that they are perfectly safe in the ballroom, which is waterproof and air tight.  This is a clear signal that those folks are doomed.<br /><br /> There's  former big city mayor Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), the overprotective father of Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), who is in love with hunk Christian (Mike Vogel).  Rounding out the roster of characters are an obnoxious passenger (Kevin Dillon), a waiter who serves as a guide through the ship (Freddy Rodriguez), a pretty stowaway (Mia Maestro), and Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), a gambler who makes a living playing high-stakes poker on cruise ships.<br /><br /> Dylan, the apparent main character, musters his little group together and leads them through all sorts of danger in a hopeful attempt to reach the bottom -- now the top -- of the ship to safety.  Navigating the narrow passageways, elevator shafts, air ducts, and ballast tanks proves tough going as fears and tensions mount.  But there is never real concern for these folks, who are on hand simply to picked off by the ravages of water, fire, and heavy machinery.<br /><br /> Like "Mission Impossible III," "Poseidon" offers no surprises.  It is a well crafted movie whose special effects must have cost considerably more than the collective price tag for talent.  Digital technology makes anything possible, but we are at the point when we are no longer blown away by an obviously digitally-rendered shot.  The opening, uninterrupted shot of the Poseidon is an example.  The camera views the ship from the starboard side at water level, sweeps up and across the bow of the ship to port, where it rises to deck level, glides along toward the back of the ship, tracks into a jogging Josh Lucas, then continues its overview of the ship, winding up viewing it from aft.  Five years ago this would have blown audiences away.  Now, however, it doesn't register as anything special.<br /><br /> What is missed most in this remake is the aging Shelley Winters, who stole the original film with the scene in which she swims underwater to help her comrades continue their escape to safety.  No longer the svelte ingenue of "A Place in the Sun," Winters unashamedly swam like a whale, giving new meaning to service above and beyond the call of duty.  In "Poseidon," Lucas's Dylan dives daredevil-like through water blazing with a coat of oil.  Though more dangerous, perhaps, than Winters' feat in the earlier film, it pales in dramatic impact.<br /><br /> "Poseidon" looks more like a made-for-TV film than a big-screen effort.  Its second-tier collection of actors and its over-familiarity make it hardly worth adding it to your "Must See" list.</p></body></html>

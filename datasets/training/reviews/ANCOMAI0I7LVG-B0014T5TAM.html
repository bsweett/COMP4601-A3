I was surfing the web looking at upcoming `Oscar fare' and I stumbled upon a still of James McAvoy from this movie I had never heard of called `Atonement'.  At the time I was too wrapped up in another buzzed about film (one that eventually turned into disappointment) to really give this one all that much attention, but as the year progressed forward and the buzz for `Atonement' kept growing I decided to give it a look.  That's when I got my hands on Ian McEwan's novel; the source inspiration for this film.  A few days later I was in tears as I turned the final page of the novel and I just knew that this movie was going to be something special.  I just knew that if it was done right then it would be, quite possibly, the best epic romance ever filmed.  Then I got the opportunity to see the movie and I must say it was everything I dreamed it would be.<br /><br />The film (as well as the novel) follows a certain lie that destroys the lives of three people.  Young Briony Tallis is a very imaginative child.  At thirteen she possesses a maturity that is beyond her years, but it is also a false sense of maturity.  This is to say that Briony only thinks she is mature.  Briony and her sister Cecilia come from a very wealthy family and live in a beautiful home in England.  Robbie Turner, the family housekeeper's son, has pretty much grown up with them like a brother and has been taken under the wing of their parents.  While on the outset one might sense a sort of distain between Cecilia and Robbie it soon becomes apparent that that distain is in all actuality a grounded yet unexpected love.<br /><br />Briony doesn't understand this love.<br /><br />Through a series of events that are misinterpreted by Briony she draws some very unhealthy and inaccurate conclusions about Robbie and when a horrible act of violence is committed against Briony's visiting cousin Lola, Robbie is the first person to whom the finger points.  This false accusation stakes the base or foundation for `Atonement'.  As Robbie is imprisoned and then shipped off to war; as Cecilia writes off her family and begins working as a nurse awaiting Robbie's return; as Briony, stricken with guilt, forsakes her higher education to nurse wounded soldiers, we are always left with this impetuous lie hanging over our heads and lingering in the air.<br /><br />The acting on the parts of the entire cast is flawless, but like many of the critics have already noted, there are three performances that stand out above the rest.  James McAvoy turns in his finest performance to date as the accused; Robbie Turner.  What I love about this performance is the fact that the emotions seem to peel away from him to reveal a man raked by pain and suffering yet determined to find his way back to the arms of his one true love.  Keira Knightley once again proves that she is more than a pretty face (and what a pretty face) with her flawless portrayal of Cecilia.  Her performance is delicate and precise; a very mature turn for which is a stark contrast to her other lauded performance in `Pride and Prejudice'.  Both characters are drastically different yet similar in perplexity.  She wears both very well.  The character of Briony Tallis is separated among three actresses, one of which stands out among the rest.  Young Saoirse Ronan plays Briony at age thirteen, the Briony who starts this downward spiral.  Her performance is in a word `flawless'.  She brilliantly captures the danger that rests inside innocent wonderment and displays an almost cold demeanor that, when analyzed closely, gives way to the immaturity within her character that she cannot accept.  It's a marvelous performance.<br /><br />The other two actresses that portray Briony are Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave.  Both of them do a fine job but neither have the power that Ronan has.  This may have to do with the fact that Ronan's part is lengthier and much baitier.  Garai does a fine job in getting under Briony's guilt but she at times appears a tad lost, as if she's not sure what she should do next.  This could throw some off but once Redgrave comes on the screen she answers a few questions we may have and sheds some light on Garai's seemingly odd behavior.  Redgrave is miraculous in her very short scene but I feel that I can't really speak of it without giving too much away so I'll refrain from saying anything more.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast is on point throughout.  Young Juno Temple is memorable as the victimized Lola Quincey and brothers Felix and Charlie von Simson capture the innocence of Jackson and Pierrot beautifully.  Patrick Kennedy portrays Leon Tallis with great brotherly attention and Harriet Walter and Brenda Blethyn portray opposite spectrums of motherhood memorably.  Benedict Cumberbatch is noteworthy for his intense performance as Paul Marshall.<br /><br />The real star here though, is none other than director Joe Wright.  His attention to detail is miraculous.  What I love about his approach here is that it is epic in its broad scope and flashy visual grace but delicate in that it never overlooks the little things.  Sure, it's beautiful but it's also very intricate and cautious.  Wright works very hard to do his source material justice and manages to do so with flying colors.  Just look at the lauded Dunkirk tracking sequence; orgasmic to say the least; but more so, the library love scene is in my opinion the single best sequence in film this year.  The way that Wright was able to create such raw lusty emotions without shedding an article of clothing; the way Knightley's head, stiff and tense, arches to stare McAvoy in the eyes and whisper "I love you"; every single detail just creates this flawless experience.  Combine this with 2005's `Pride and Prejudice' and one can see that Joe Wright is setting himself up for a marvelous career.<br /><br />`Atonement' is truly a very beautiful film, visually as well as emotionally.  Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey superbly captures the beauty that surrounds this masterpiece while Wright and his cast drip such flawless emotional detail.  One can't help but absorb this films magnificence.  Truly one of the best films to be released this year; a complete and memorable masterpiece; `Atonement' has a place alongside films like `Titanic' as one of the grandest and greatest epics ever filmed.</p></body></html>

Predictable but great acting from Denzel Washington and Chris Pine. And the best part: the movie ran at just over 90 minutes breaking from what seems to be Hollywood's latest unwritten law that says movies need to run past the 2-hour mark. Thanks, Tony Scott.<br /><br />Scott likes the train business I guess and he brought Denzel with him again after they rode <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LMV7Q6">Pelham 1 2 3</a> together back in 2009. And it's funny....Either a major coincidence has occurred or Tony Scott said to Denzel, "Could you just play the same character that you played in our last movie?" Come to think of it, I think Denzel has played the same character in his last 20-something movies. Clearly the guy has just found a character comfort zone that he knows the audience will love every time. And indeed the Denzel character works. The last time I saw Denzel not playing the same character that he was playing in Unstoppable was all the way back in 1992's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045D3N3O">Malcolm X</a> (he played Malcolm X).<br /><br />I was definitely entertained by Unstoppable. Simple story: A careless accident causes a freight train to go on a runaway path unmanned and at full throttle. Washington and Pine are respectively engineer and conductor in the field who take it upon themselves to come up with a plan to stop the out of control train. And of course Denzel's corporate superiors, government emergency forces and the cops are all idiots (as Hollywood so predictably and consistently casts). Director Scott keeps the movie rolling down the track with some decent suspenseful action as the mild mannered combination of Denzel and Chris Pine attempt to save the day.<br /><br />All in all, excellent rental but far from worthy of purchase for your collection. At minimum check it out when it comes out on cable or satellite.</p></body></html>

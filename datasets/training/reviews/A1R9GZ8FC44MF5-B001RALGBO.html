<meta name="summary" content="Too politicaly correct, not enough disaster."></head><body><p>For being called a disaster film i expected more disaster.  All that happens is theres a few tornadoes, some water, it gets cold, then everything goes back to normal, o yeah and some people freeze in the process.  Wow i havent seen that before (the core, deep impact, its been done).  Sure its about global warming, but then why is it so damn cold... im not saying it wouldnt be cold, but if it is so cold then why do the wolves last so long out in the blizzard, and the people and buildings feeeze in a second, are the invincible wolves, NO.  The rest of the movie makes sense they did a pretty good job with science and explained what they needed to.  The visuals are good but not oscar worthy, i mean come on what was with those wolves, the hyenas from exorcist the beginning looked realer (and that was a much better overall film too, much better), and all those shots of NY covered in snow and ice looked hand drawn almost, the tidal wave looked the best out of them all, the tornadoes were alright but you only see them for 2 mins.  Overall the film is decent, decent performances (not good) decent, no intense situation of peril (all the disaster stuff takes up like 10 mins of the movie all together, not impressive), the visuals are pretty good, there is too dramatic of a score for the movie because there is no drama, we need more background info on the characters, ID4 and Godzilla are better, Rolands best film is the patriot, its pretty good.  Ill give it a 5 out of a 10 for the attempt at some good mayhem, but it falls alittle short.</p></body></html>

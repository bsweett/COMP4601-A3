<meta name="summary" content="Off with Alice's head"></head><body><p>I wish this film would have been more pyscadelic and trippy and less violent and boring.  I think they should have left out the battle sequence with the jaborwocky.  It reminded me too much of Lord of the Rings.  The only character I found interesting was Helena Bonham's character as the red queen.  Anne Hathaway totally overacted as the white queen and Johnny Depp was annoying as usual.  How could you mess up Alice in Wonderland?  It's not rocket science people.</p></body></html>

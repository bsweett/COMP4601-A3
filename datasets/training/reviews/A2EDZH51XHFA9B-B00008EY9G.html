Spend the film wondering how director James Mangold (who did manage to make one very good film previous to this in Cop Land, but has otherwise foisted such tripe upon the viewing public as Girl, Interrupted and Heavy) and screenwriter Michael Cooney (he wrote a script for Jack Frost 2: Return of the mutant Killer Snowman. Need I say more?) managed to put together such a startling, refreshing piece of filmmaking as this.<p>Ten strangers are stranded in the Nevada desert during a rainstorm. They start dying. As the deaths get more and more incongruous, the survivors begin to turn on one another. It's a very thin plot... or it would be without a twist that is, quite simply, completely different than anything you've ever seen in a thriller. It's a plot twist that ranks right up there with Fight Club, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, `Salem's Lot (the book, not the movie), fill in whatever you want that left your jaw hanging open. The setup is brilliant, the payoff even more so.<p>Much of the credit here is due to a stellar cast, headed by John Cusack (Max, Being John Malkovich), who has turned his eighties teen stardom into one of the best-managed careers in Hollywood today. His foil is played by Ray Liotta (Narc, Cop Land). Others at the hotel are John C. McGinley (Scrubs, Intensity), Amanda Peet (Igby Goes Down), John Hawkes (From Dusk Til Dawn, Playing God), Jake Busey (The Frighteners)... you get the idea. High-powered cast. Everyone has perfect timing throughout. Expect much; you'll get it.<p>Easily one of the best films of the year, if not the best. A must for any fan of intelligent thrillers, horror films, graveyard humor, John Cusack... oh, forget it. It's a must for everybody. **** ?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="'Angels' are Heavenly Creatures"></head><body><p>But are these girls real angels? Look at Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu. Decide for yourself... They are secret agents working for an unknown man named Charlie and their new mission has to do with a computer programmer whose been kidnapped. The guy is a complete dork. There's also a tall, skinny guy who likes to smell hair and you know he had an obsession with Barbies. One of the girls eats a lot and orders way too much at a drive-thru. One can't dance or sing (Soul Train has a bad reputation now because of this girl). One can't cook muffins, which are deadly and can sit as a rock in your stomach, literally. Yet, they're all supposed to be 'angels.' Even at the beginning, an 'angel' was disguised as LL Cool J. Can you imagine that? The movie is deranged. They even threw in Bill Murray for some reason. Oh well, it's just entertainment.</p></body></html>

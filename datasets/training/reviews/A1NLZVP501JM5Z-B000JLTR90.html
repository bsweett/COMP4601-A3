Paul Giamitti is one of my favorite actors and after this performance he needs an Oscar, he carries this whole movie on his shoulders and makes it great.<br /><br />I don't know why everyone is going:  Oh, it wasn't scary it sucks.  Name one other scary movie Shymalan has made besides the Sixth Sense.  None.  Signs was about faith and believing.  Unbreakable was about becoming what you were meant to be.  The Village was about realizing there is sorrow in the world.  None of those scared me, but I loved them all because M. Night Shymalan took me to that world and made me believe.<br /><br />The critics are way off on this movie.  I've read hundreds of reviews for differrent movies and the critics will say:  This movie follows the basic action plot, with no surprises blah blah blah.  Then this movie is made with originaltiy and style and the critics go:  What the heck this is stupid, I don't get it.  I don't put much value in critics anyway.<br /><br />Overall M. Night Shymalan has crafted a well made movie about loss and finding your place in life, you just have to be willing to believe.</p></body></html>

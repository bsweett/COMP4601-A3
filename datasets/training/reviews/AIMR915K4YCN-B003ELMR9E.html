<meta name="summary" content="Enter Sandman... ASAP!..."></head><body><p>INSOMNIA is a fantastic thriller, full of twists, turns, and arctic-cold atmosphere. Al Pacino (The Godfather 1 and 2, Scarface, Heat, etc.) is LA homicide detective Will Dormer, sent to Nightmute, Alaska to investigate a murder. Will has a lot of professional / personal baggage that complicates matters, causing him to hide his own secrets while trying to solve the crime. Add to this the fact that he's arrived in northern Alaska during it's season of perpetual daylight, and he's got major sleeping problems as well! Between the murder case, the eternal daylight, and Will's own conscience, he quickly becomes a mess! It's amazing that he can still function at all, let alone, well. Hilary Swank (The Gift, 11:14) is a young officer who assists Dormer, only to find her own loyalties and sense of justice challenged. Robin Williams (One Hour Photo, The Night Listener) plays a seemingly mild-mannered sociopath whose one frantic desire is to cover / save his own a$$! INSOMNIA succeeds at building tension while showing Will Dormer's mental disintegration. A classic crime drama w/ something extra. Loaded w/ memorable scenes like the chase-in-the-fog, chase-across-the-floating-logs, and invisible-oncoming-truck sequences, INSOMNIA holds up well after many repeat viewings. Highly recommended...  P.S.- Watch for both Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins from the GINGER SNAPS movies, as the victim's best friend and the eulogizer at her funeral respectively...</p></body></html>

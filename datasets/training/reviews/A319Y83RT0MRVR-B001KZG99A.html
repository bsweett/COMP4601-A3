This movie is the way films should be - entertaining, yet though-provoking; exciting yet educational; realistic, yet futuristic; and more importantly, well acted, well directed, and well written. Its main characters self-prophecies to have flaws, but this movie hardly has any. With superb special effects, amazing gadgets, and stunning visual effects - this movie was meant to be seen in Blu-Ray.</p></body></html>

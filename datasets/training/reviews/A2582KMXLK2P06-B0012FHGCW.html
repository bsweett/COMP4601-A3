This one is a little bit different from that.<br /><br />This movie is more about a loner guy who leaves his mom, dad, and sister and goes through life trying to survive without them as soon as college is over.  He travels all across America, meeting different people and going through new experiences each time.  Throughout the movie you can't wait to find out where he ends up next.<br /><br />This is one really good movie.  I didn't expect the storyline to grab me as much as it did.  The ending was incredibly sad, and was somewhat of a twist if you ask me because I did NOT see it coming.  I thought the story was going one way, and it went completely the other way.  In fact, there were a couple different things at the end that were sad to me.<br /><br />But sadness aside, the first two hours of the movie were pure excitement.  The acting was incredible from all the characters, and I think everyone can find something to like about the storytelling because it comes across in such an easy to understand, logical, and likeable way.  You just keep pulling for the main character and all the objects that get in his way to find out how he handles them.<br /><br />The only problem is that freakin' Eddie Vedder does the soundtrack for the movie, which means all the emotional scenes in the film feature Eddie's distinct style.  I'm not a fan of his music (or Pearl Jam) so I find his singing more of a distraction than anything.<br /><br />Great movie.  You won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

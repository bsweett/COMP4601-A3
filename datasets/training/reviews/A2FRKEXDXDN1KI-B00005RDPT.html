<meta name="summary" content="Talented people together in one movie!!!"></head><body><p>I have never seen the original movie but I will comment on this remake and the DVD.<p>First, it's nice to see a movie where talented people are together in one movie.  This rarely happens and it's nice to see everyone gel together quite well.<p>Second, I really enjoyed the characters especially the individual fashion sense of each character (explained in a featurette on the DVD)<p>But the one thing that has troubled me about this movie was the ending.  And to confirm how I felt about the ending, listening to the director's commentary, it seems many people felt the same way.  It blew me away to hear the commentary of what if we could of reshot the ending and talking of how they wish they could of done it.  Hmmm...<p>Anyway, the DVD has a lot of good features in it and the plot was interesting but I felt with so many talented individuals, I was expecting more from this movie.  Anyway, it's an ok movie.  Definitely not worthy of a perfect score but it's a good movie nonetheless.</p></body></html>

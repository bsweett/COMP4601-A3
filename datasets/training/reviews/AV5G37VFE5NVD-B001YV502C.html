<meta name="summary" content="Hope survives amidst bleakness and futility in Alfonso Cuaron's stupefying masterpiece"></head><body><p>Of all the cinema's many apocalypse films, never have I seen one so profoundly cynical and melancholy as Alfonso Cuaron's CHILDREN OF MEN.  Adapted from popular novelist P.D. James' one departure from her usual mysteries, the film is set in 2027, where the world is speedily falling into mass chaos.  Humankind can no longer reproduce, and as the lead character, Theo (Clive Owen), remarks, "All of this [humanity] will be gone in seventy years."  The one society that remains relatively kempt is Britain, where Theo attempts to evade the frequent terrorist attacks and assaults from savage bands of the homeless.  One day Theo is reunited with his old flame, Julian (Julianne Moore), now the leader of a terrorist organization.  Julian needs papers to escort a young woman across the border; Theo reluctantly agrees to get the papers and escort the young woman, but finds that his role is far more important than he could ever have dreamed when he learns just what the young woman is carrying.<br /><br />CHILDREN OF MEN is more than likely the finest of all apocalyptic films, surpassing even such classics as MAD MAX and its sequel, MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR.  While those films had impressive-enough craftmanship to give them considerable cult appeal, they lack the artistry of CHILDREN OF MEN.  This is due completely to Cuaron and the highly-talented cast, which also includes the surprisingly menacing Chiwetel Ejiofor and the always delightful Michael Caine as a gas-passing, pot-smoking Lennon-esque character.  Cuaron made a name for himself with the erotic Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN and the magical HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, but CHILDREN OF MEN is unarguably his masterpiece.<br /><br />Cuaron succeeds wonderfully in the dramatic sense, inspiring absolutely top-notch performances from all the actors.  Owen, as usual, is simply marvelous.  As the film begins, he's unquestionably the antihero, but by the film's end he has become a hero in the most sincere form of the word.  Moore is typically impressive, but her role is almost painfully short.  It's Caine who steals the show, as he has done in every film he's appeared in over the last four years or so.  His ridiculously aloof, rude, yet oddly charming performance provides some much-needed comic relief amidst a stupefying amount of bleakness.<br /><br />However, Cuaron is even more of a success in his role as a sci-fi director.  All too often an interesting concept is wasted on a pretentious filmmaker who uses big names and bombastic explosions to attract audiences.  Cuaron doesn't strive for greatness; it comes naturally through the effort he puts into his films and the amount of sheer talent he has.  In CHILDREN OF MEN, he fashions enough of a science-fiction film to make the audience think, enough of a drama to get the audience emotionally-involved, and enough of a thriller to make the audience panic.  It's how surprisingly down-to-earth the film is that makes it all seem so terrifyingly real.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, the most horrible aspect of CHILDREN OF MEN is its depiction of the near future.  This vision of 2027 isn't far-fetched at all - in fact, most of the film's scares come from how chillingly similar 2027 is to 2007.  It's a believable future, where newspaper clippings protesting the Iraq War still remain, the designs of cars have changed very slightly, and rock band Radiohead has finally received the credit it deserves.  The suddenty of humankind's infertility, and the speed at which humanity descends into sheer madness, is enough to keep anyone awake long nights dreading the seeming inevitability of so black a future.<br /><br />What keeps the audience from drowning under CHILDREN OF MEN's tidal wave of futility is hope, a white light that becomes progressively brighter as the film pushes on.  Hope that things are not as bad as they may seem, hope that things will get better, hope that we aren't helpless at the world's end.  But as strong as this hope may be, and even though the film does end on a relatively happy note, it's the fear that things will not get better and that we are helpless that will leave theatergoers trembling and pondering direly far beyond the end credits.</p></body></html>

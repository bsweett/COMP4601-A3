It's "so bad that's it good."  I'm not one of them.<br /><br />Because I enjoyed the original film from the 1970s.  That film had a mood, a point, an intelligence behind it.<br /><br />What does this film have?  Nic Cage mugging.  Some weird feminist cult.  And countless reasons that American cinema will totally screw up an original foreign film.<br /><br />In the original film, Edward Woodward is a devout Christian police officer searching for a missing girl on a creepy island of pagans.  He eventually falls into their hands and dies a martyr's death, holding onto his faith to the end.<br /><br />In this version...well...Americans are squeamish when it comes to the whole religion thing.  So Nic Cage can't have any beliefs of his own.  And Americans would also have a tough time reconciling themselves to a tragic ending for such a pious man.  So Nic Cage is...a jerk.  A moron.  A woman-beater.<br /><br />Of course, I don't believe any of this.  But this is the type of thinking that went into remaking this film: Hollywood's contempt for its audience.<br /><br />Looking at it that way, you can see this project twist and break and completely come apart to become the absolute mess that is THE WICKER MAN.<br /><br />Check out the original film and deal with it.<br />Watch this clumsy mess of a remake and shake your head.<br />Hollywood thought they were pleasing you.</p></body></html>

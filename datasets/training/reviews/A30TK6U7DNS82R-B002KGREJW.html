Like when the door falls off, people in the theater laughed a little bit, perhaps startled by the noise of the door's clang on the parking lot asphalt.  All in all it was a pretty glum affair, but a good one, sort of like the old-time New American Cinema movies of the 1970s like THE LONG GOODBYE or FIVE EASY PIECES.<br /><br />A family group tries to complete a roadtrip of 1000 miles West, mirroring an earlier voyage of discovery and colonial conquest by American empire builders and covered wagon pioneers.  And of ci=urse you can't take a road trip in the movies without learning a lot about yourself.  For an independent film, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE hits practically all the three-act plot points Syd Field and his ilk recommend.  Each of the actors undergoes his or her own trauma, revelation, and recovery.  Most of them were pretty well done, like Greg Kinnear's encounter with Bryan Cranston at the Scottsdale hotel.  It did seem a little coincidental that little Olive would happen to have brought with her a test for color blindness to use as a game.  That was hard to swallow.<br /><br />But what really threw me off was Steve Carell's encounter with the one person in the whole world he didn't want to see, at some kind of roadside 7-11 in the middle of nowhere.  Did the screenwriters ever pause to ask themselves if an audience would believe this?  It is to Carell's credit that he almost makes it work.  And the rival Proust scholar who takes over Frank's title and his boyfriend?  Isn't it the Canadian actor who used to play the gay son on Dynasty--Gordon Thomson?  Maybe I'm getting mixed up and his character wasn't gay, just seemed like it.  If so, it's great that Gordon Thomson has hooked himself onto a hit.  It's been a long time between engagements for the man who once replaced Lane Davies as Mason Capwell on the NBC daytime drama, SANTA BARBARA.<br /><br />It was just little things that prevent me from awarding this film four stars instead of five.  Little things like, the revelation of the nature of Olive's number, which she has been practicing all through the film, at the close of the beauty pageant, is it supposed to signal that Alan Arkin's character has been molesting her during their nights together?  I can't wait for the ten years later sequel, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE 2: MONSTER: THE OLIVE WUORNOS STORY.</p></body></html>

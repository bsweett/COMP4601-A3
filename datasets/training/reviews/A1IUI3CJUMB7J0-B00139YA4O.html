<meta name="summary" content="A great series one of the best series on tv"></head><body><p>In the fall of 2004 there was the breakout hit Depreste Housewives and thent here was the hit Lost. I have to say lost is addictive and keeps you wanting more. The show about plane crash survivors that are strandid on a mysterious island is a great premise. The show has good acting and good story lines. There are some flaws witht he show at times the show drags on and is boring and the show dosent reville lots t=so it might leave the viewer angrey. Overall one of the best shows on tv a must watch espesailly for the season finale which was really good.</p></body></html>

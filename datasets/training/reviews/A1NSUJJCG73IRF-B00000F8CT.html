<meta name="summary" content="Alien  (1979)"></head><body><p>Director:  Ridley Scott<br />Cast:  Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphett Koto, Veronica Cartwright.<br />Running Time:  116 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence, gore, and language.<p>Not too often does a film come along that changes the course of a genre such as &quot;Alien&quot;.  While &quot;Halloween&quot; transformed the slasher film category from an underground gimmick to the mainstream, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; made demonic cinema not only appalling by Oscar-worthy, and &quot;Jaws&quot; set the tone for all future summer blockbusters, &quot;Alien&quot; slipped under the radar and eventually become one of the most acclaimed science-fiction/horror films of all time.<p>The principle is basic (and used hundreds of times since its release in 1979):  a space crew has to emergency land on an unknown planet due to a ship malfunction.  While they are fixing up their craft on this mysterious world of LV-426, they encounter strange-looking parasites, yet think nothing of it.  One of the parasites latches onto a crew member and discharges a horrific creature inside--which bursts from the chest and proceeds to feast on the rest of the crew members.  Sigourney Weaver is brilliant as the unsuspected heroine, battling the acid-spitting, face-for-a-tongue monster with all of her grit and might.<p>Director Ripley Scott uses a gloriously constructed set to develop a tense, terrifying film that has lasted the tests of time to still be considered one of the best.  Weaver's performance was not only a chance to showcase her acting ability, but also a metaphorical stange for the entire female industry--proclaiming that men do not always have to be the heroes in film.  Good special effects, a passable script, and fine performances throughout.  Has lost its effectiveness over the years and was outdone by the stupendous sequel &quot;Aliens&quot;, but the original is still a master work of terror and is just as important as any film in the late 1970s.</p></body></html>

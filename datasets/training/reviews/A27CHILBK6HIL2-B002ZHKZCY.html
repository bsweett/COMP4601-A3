<meta name="summary" content="An Espionage Thriller That Is Riveting & Intelligent"></head><body><p>MOVIE: Today it's hard to find a movie that will actually thrill you without special effects or an absurd unreal plot. The Bourne Franchise does just that. This espionage thriller is based on the second of Robert Ludlum's trilogy of books. With one more left to go its getting down to the wire. I strongly recommend that you watch the first movie before seeing this one, even if you've already seen it. The plot of this movie is ongoing and in order to have the full benefit it would be wise to refresh yourself with The Bourne Identity. Jason Bourne has started over with young woman he met in the first movie, now in India, but when someone frames him for murder the government is back on his tail. He is now thrown back into the cat and mouse game that he once knew, but knowing this movie, the cat and mouse roles change constantly. New director, Paul Greengrass, brings a new realism to the franchise. Previous director, Doug Liman, had a more formal take to the story. In this movie the camera is constantly moving back and forth to give the audience that gritty realism that fits. The first movie was a lot calmer as well with the plot. This continuation is fast-paced and tense. The car chase in this movie was incredible. I can honestly say it was better than the Matrix Reloaded's highway chase because NO CGI's WERE USED! Movies are trying to create a new reality within the computer world and trying to make audiences believe that its really happening. Why not just take the extra effort and coreograph a real car chase that will have the audience on edge instead of crashing two CGI trucks head on? The climax of the chase in the tunnel was stunning. The movie overall was stunning. You will not find a modern day action thriller like this anywhere else .<br /><br /> ACTING: Matt Damon does a superb job in this role. I don't think I've seen frustration acted out as well as he does it. The other high point of this movie is Brian Cox (X2, Troy, The Ring) who plays the menacing Ward Abbott. I really like Cox as an actor because his roles seem so believable. Joan Allen (The Contender, Face/Off) makes a new role in this movie and does a decent job, but I found her performance a little forced. Almost as if she tried just a little too hard to be a top government bigot. Overall though the acting was superb<br /><br /> BOTTOM LINE: In a day where computers do everything for us, even entertain us at the movies, The Bourne Supremacy was refreshingly good. Nothing is overdone to point where you say &quot;oh, come on, yeah right&quot;. The Bourne Ultimatum is the next and final chapter in Ludlum's story and I can't wait.</p></body></html>

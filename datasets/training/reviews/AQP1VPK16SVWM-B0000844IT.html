<meta name="summary" content=""Gimme some sugar baby!" (Evil Ash)-Raimi's campy humor filled horror classic goes high def"></head><body><p>Placing tongue firmly in cheek (even more so than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IY48PS">The Evil Dead [Blu-ray</a>]and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005J9ZE5I">Evil Dead 2 (25th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray</a>]), "Army of Darkness" remains one of my favorite B-movies combining elements of The Three Stooges, horror flicks, The Marx Brothers, a healthy dose of Monty Python style silliness, the Dark Ages and cheesy movies from the 50's/60's. How could it miss? It has it all--severed body parts, witches that will "swallow your soul", a damsel in distress (who initially hates the hero), a chain saw replacing the hero's severed hand and an evil spirit that will arise if the hero doesn't save the day while saying "Klaatu verada nikto".<br /><br />Ash (Bruce Campbell)the ultimate idiot hero gets sucked through a vortex and ends up in the Dark Ages. Captured by Lord Arthur and believed to be an agent for the Scottish Duke Henry, Ash fights off a creature in the pit (they are being put to death). His only chance to get back is to help reclaim the book Necronomicon Ex-Mortis from a haunted forest. Oh, and there's THREE books to choose from one of which bites and the other has a vortex inside it. When Ash takes the book but forgets to properly say "Klaatu Verada nikto" the army of the dead are released led by Evil Ash. Yep. It's absurd, funny and gross--a very nice combination.<br /><br />The "Screwhead Edition" improves on the DVD edition but you'll see quality as broad as the humor in the film--it varies exceptionally good looking to so-so depending on the use of visuals, etc. Keep in mind this was shot pre-CGI using a variety of visual effects techniques so sometimes its really soft, grainy and sometimes not. The Screwhead Edition is also much brighter than previous, darker DVDs. Which one is right? I dunno but if you're used to the older DVDs prepare for a bit of a shock.<br /><br />Audio sounds pretty good remixed for six channels although it's not going to blow out your windows nor suck you into the vortex.<br /><br />The special features are...a bit underwhelming. There's no commentary track which was one of the delights of the previous editions (which had multiple commentary tracks that were different for each edition as I recall). We get a featurette "The Making of the Deadites" a pretty good retrospective glimpse back into the making of the film featuring the visual effects supervisors.<br /><br />We also get the original (alternate) ending which Raimi was forced to reshoot by Universal executives after a preview as well as the trailer.<br /><br />If you're getting this as an ultimate edition you'll be disappointed but if you can get this inexpensively as an upgrade, I would enjoy it for what it is--a fun, campy flick with Campbell in top form and a nice looking, lighter looking transfer.<br /><br />I'd love to give this edition five stars (hey, I love the film) but Universal originally was going to provide more extras (including commentary tracks). I'm not sure what exactly happened but hopefully we'll eventually see that edition released.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very Provocative"></head><body><p>The movie JFK was made 28 years after the assassaination of President John Kennedy and was an effective history lesson for people who were not alive at the time, like myself. This movie examines the event from the viewpoint of Jim Garrison, a New Oreleans District Attorney who takes a look at the case three years after the shooting and finds numerous inconsistencies with the given investigation. There are many stars in this movie that give great performances, among others Kevin Costner, of course, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau as a U.S. Senator, Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald, Kevin Bacon as a male prostitute, Joe Pesci as a principal part of the conspiracy, Donald Sutherland as an ex-CIA man who helps Garrison, Tommy Lee Jones as a conspirator with a few secrets, and Seinfeld fans will recognize Wayne Knight (Newman). This movie, although it is not a documentary and should not be regarded as one, does make the Lyndon Johnson coup theory seem more than plausible, but the only thing that makes sense. This movie will make amaze and surprise you until the end. It is too long, but it is worth your time.<p>Well, it's provocative, anyway, but pretty -farfetched-, admittedly.</p></body></html>

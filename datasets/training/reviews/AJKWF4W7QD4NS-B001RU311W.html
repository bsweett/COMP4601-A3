By and far, it is Penn's Oscar winning performance that propels Gus Van Sant's Milk, which manages to recount Harvey's struggle to lead the way for gay civil rights while also paying loving homage to the man as well.  While the film could have possibly gone a bit more in depth, Milk is nevertheless a powerful and often moving biopic that will manage to win you over, and with surprising turns from Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna, and an Oscar nominated Josh Brolin as Harvey's fateful opposition Dan White; Van Sant manages to coax the best performances from a cast that may be the best and most thoughtful work he's ever churned out.  Of special mention is James Franco as Harvey's lover Scott; who turns in the best performance of his career so far.  With his body of work so far, Franco is proving himself to be one of the best actors of his generation.  Other than that, Milk is purely Penn's show, and on that merit alone, the film is definitely worth seeing.  All in all, Milk is a more than worthwhile endeavor indeed, and is definitely worth your time.</p></body></html>

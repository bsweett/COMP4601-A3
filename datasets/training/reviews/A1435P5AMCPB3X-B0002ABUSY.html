<meta name="summary" content="Decent update on the old zombie film"></head><body><p>Based in Millwaukee, this film is a non stop thrill ride. Zombies popping out of all places.  This movie starts right out from start to finish with non stop thrills, and pretty good special effets.  I was not expecting much when I cought this flipping through the movie channels, but I found myself watching it all the way through.  Simple to follow, suspenseful enough, worth a rental, or even a purchase.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="INTELLIGENT HORROR MOVIE WITH AN AESTHETIC BRAIN. BRILLIANT!"></head><body><p>First off, 28 Days Later is billed as a horror movie but if you are expecting ghosts, quaint ogres walking at midnight dripping blood off their ears, or spirits in funny baseball masks, you shouldn't be looking here. The "horror" in this movie is crisp and intense, but emerges from the predicament of the characters rather than the usual gory antics of typical Hollywood genre films. <p>Rarely have I been so frightened and made to think at the same time, and I don't mean only in the cheesy "Night of the Living Dead" manner. This movie is a very visceral and scary harbinger of what may lie ahead for humanity, what with all the biological and viral threats that have become commonplace conversation starters these days. <p>The acting is tight; the musical score clearly shows passionate creation, hear out the samples here on Amazon itself under the Popular Music section to see what I mean; the reel is slightly pixelated/blurry with a colorful strobelight effect resulting from using a deliberately smaller-than-normal frame rate (the whole movie is shot in digital video btw); and the editing techniques sport a very stylized jerking/stroking (remember "Pi"?). You may relish the movie for just the aesthetics alone, if you are into that sort of thing.  <p>But above all, the film evokes some pretty leery thoughts in almost any person with common sense and a basic awareness of current affairs. It is almost an allegorical warning for things to come. <p>Edge of the seat stuff. Watch it!</p></body></html>

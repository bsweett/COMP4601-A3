<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg and Universal do it again...that is, RIP YOU OFF!"></head><body><p>Alright, if you've never got around to adding Jaws to your dvd collection then now is as good a time as any with this edition. But if you shelled out for the "25th Anniversary" disc, then STAY AWAY from this scam. It comes with the unabridged documentary that was found on laser. But does it have a commentary track? Are you kidding? What else is Universal and $pielberg going to lure you into buying this again when its released on HDVD? These people didn't even see fit to remaster the print with the latest digital technology. This is a shameful, worthless edition. Univeral / $pielberg deserve nothing less than your enmity and contempt for failing dvddom AGAIN.</p></body></html>

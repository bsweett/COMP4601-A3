<meta name="summary" content="WOW from Former Spy Honorary Hacker Critic of Corrupt USG"></head><body><p>This is not just a 5-star entertainment movie, it is a 5-star civic education movie.  As a former spy who is also an honorary hacker, a regular speaker at Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE) (the movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WXEGLO">Hackers</a> and a participant in Hackers of Silicon Valley and occasionally Hac-tic in Europe,  I consider this movie the infrastructure equivalent to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002MB7QW">The Day After Tomorrow (Full Screen Edition)</a> Bottom line: the US Government at the political level is totally corrupt and impeachable for betrayal of the public trust going back to 1975 when peak oil was ignored, 1985 when water scarcity was clearly understood, and 1990 when Winn Schwartau, Peter Black and I and several others warned of the vulnerability of all electronic systems.<br /><br />There is one MAJOR error in the movie: the SCADA systems that control all our utilities (electricty, natural gas, oil, water) are NOT isolated from the Internet, and the Homeland Security Committes in Congress are freaking out over this as I write this.  Everyone built computers and networks without considering either librarians or security specialists.  It is a hodge podge.  Every single system we have can be hacked, the Chinese brought Vice President Cheney down over Singapore as a demonstration of their ability to fry any US missile, airplane, tank, or destroyer.<br /><br />This movie is an utterly superb rendition of the incompetence and malfeasance of the US Government at the political level, and I am going to add it to my list of serious DVDs for that reason.<br /><br />The scenario, where the whistleblower gets crucified by the government instead of listened to, is all too familiar to me.  When I first sought to turn the secret world toward open sources in 1988, getting the Commandant of the Marine Corps to sign off on an article "Intelligence Challenges of the 1990's," the USG would not listen to the Commandant.  Four years later I published "E3i: Ethics, Ecology, the Environment, and Intelligence: An Alternative Paradigm" that essentially called for everything open and everything safe, the top female at CIA said "This confirms Steele's place on the lunatic fringe.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for the classroom.  This is Political Science 101, Economics 101, Ethics 101, Sociology 101.<br /><br />I especially liked the inclusion of ham radio in the movie.  Not only is the movie, the acting, everything superior, but someone really did do good homework here.  Ham Radio Operators were the first hackers, and the US Government, military, and law enforcement first attempted to drive them out of existence.  As the movie character says, "ham radio is end of the world insurance."  It will work when everything else fails.<br /><br />See also, in addition to the two above:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305047456">Hackers</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009RS0EM">Hackers - Wizards of the Electronic Age</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800141768">The Net</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K19E">The Matrix</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7CMRW">Syriana (Full Screen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471782661">The Art of Intrusion: The Real Stories Behind the Exploits of Hackers, Intruders & Deceivers</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0141000511">Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0962870005">Terminal Compromise</a></p></body></html>

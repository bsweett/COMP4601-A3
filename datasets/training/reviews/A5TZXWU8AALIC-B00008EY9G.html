<meta name="summary" content="Cuts Above the Usual Thriller"></head><body><p>Interesting thriller.  I knew something was unusual about it when it came out but I didn't see it until it showed up on cable.  I really like the cast and I think the writing/directing keeps the viewer on track throughout the Twilight Zone-ish ending.<br />Actually, I found two endings: there's the warm fuzzy ending where someone is spared the death penalty.  And then the final ending that says something about the nature of evil.<p>I'd recommend it for people who like big twists like those found in THE SIXTH SENSE or FRAILTY.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I liked it."></head><body><p>Let me get this out of the way first.<br />And I have a feeling many of you will laugh when you read this.<br />But....I have never read the original story.<br />All I knew was some girl named Alice fell down a hole and met a bunch of strange characters and that's about it.<br />Honestly?<br />I think that gave me an advantage to actually watch the film without expecting things to go a certain way.<br />I know a lot of critics are saying this version is too much like "Lord of the Rings".<br />I can't say if that's accurate or not but the ending hardly reminded me of anything out of "Lord of the Rings".<br />I was scared, I mean REALLY scared that Burton, even with Depp and the rest of the cast wouldn't be able to pull this off.<br />I was scared right in the beginning that the film would rapidly dissolve into something so bad and so corny it would be painful to watch.<br />It didn't.<br />In a sea of weird movies, this one has to be Burton's crowing jewel of weirdness.<br />If you thought "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was weird, you haven't seen ANYTHING.<br />This movie ups the weirdness factor by 100.<br />Is that a good thing?<br />It depends.....<br />Did you like "Charlie"? If the answer is yes, than you'll probably like this.<br />I liked "Charlie" but I though this was a hundred times weirder and better.<br /><br />Ok...."Alice in Wonderland".<br />What was good?<br />Masterfull acting from Depp, Carter, and Hathaway.<br />Burton's most visually stunning movie ever.<br />Great score.<br />The film was paced well and wasn't a second too long or too short.<br />I know a lot of people were worried that the CGI would ruin the movie. It didn't, it blends seamlessly with the human actors into a film quite like no other. Some may say Avatar, but I haven't seen that yet so I really can't compare.<br /><br />What was bad?<br />There really wasn't a whole lot of story to be had here.<br />It had A story just not a very deep one.<br />What little story was there was good and it wrapped up very nicely.<br />I'm knocking one star off due to lack of a more in depth story.<br />But considering I never knew what the original story was to begin with I really can't complain.<br /><br />Let's sum it up.<br />Burton's most visually stunning film ever.<br />The entire cast is amazingly good.<br />Everything is perfect in every way except the story could have used a little more work.<br />I saw the movie in 2D not 3D but I loved the 2D version. I may or may not go see it again in 3D but I'm anxious to read what others say about the 3D version.<br />All in all,<br />"Alice in Wonderland" comes....<br />Highly Recommended!!!</p></body></html>

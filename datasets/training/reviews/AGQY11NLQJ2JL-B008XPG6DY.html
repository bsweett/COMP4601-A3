<meta name="summary" content="Jennifer Aniston is a trade mark for good work...."></head><body><p>Aside from all suspense/mystery waves of movies with a stupid good looking actress, stupid plot, and a stupid twist at the end (i.e. lame movies like "deception")... This movie is an exception; Jennifer Anniston delivers on her promise of being a star again and again. I don't want to ruin the movie for the appreciative audience, so I will simply say, very much recommended!</p></body></html>

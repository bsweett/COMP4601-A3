<meta name="summary" content=""Black Swan" is brilliant!"></head><body><p>"Black Swan" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Nina is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother Erica who exerts a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy decides to replace prima ballerina Beth Macintyre for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily, who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.<br /><br />The cast led by Natalie Portman (in her superb, Oscar-winning performance as Nina), Vincent Cassel (as Thomas Leroy) & Mila Kunis (in a solid performance as Lily) is brilliant! The directing by Darren Aronofsky (he also directed "Pi" (1998, also wrote the story & screenplay), "Requiem For A Dream" (2000, also wrote the screenplay), "The Fountain" (2006, also wrote the story & screenplay) & "The Wrestler" (2008, also produced), he is also directing the upcoming "The Wolverine" (2011), he also executive produced "The Fighter" (2010) is brilliant! The story by Andres Heinz & the screenplay by Heinz, Mark Heyman (he co-produced "The Wrestler") & John J. McLaughlin is brilliant!<br /><br />The music by Clint Mansell (who, recently did the music to "Faster" (2010) & the upcoming "Source Code" (2011), he has also done the music to all Aronofsky's films) is brilliant! The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (who, recently did the cinematography to "Iron Man 2" (2010), its original (2008), the upcoming "Cowboys & Aliens" (2011) & "The Wolverine", he has done the cinematography to all Aronofsky's films, with the expectation of "The Wrestler") is brilliant! The film editing by Andrew Weisblum (who also did the film editing to "The Darjeeling Limited" (2007), "The Wrestler" & "Fantastic Mr. Fox" (2009) is brilliant! The casting by Mary Vernieu (who, recently did the casting to "The Killer Inside Me" (2010), "The Losers" (2010), "Predators" (2010), "Machete" (2010), the upcoming "Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark" (2011), "Spy Kids 4: All The Time In The World" (2011) & "Looper" (2012), she has done the casting to Aronofsky's films since "Requiem For A Dream") is brilliant! The production design by Th&eacute;r&egrave;se DePrez (who also did the production design to "Arlington Road" (1999), "Summer Of Sam" (1999), "High Fidelity" (2000), "How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days" (2003), "The Door In The Floor" (2004), "Dark Water" (2005), "Fighting" (2009), "Brooklyn's Finest" (2010), "Jack Goes Boating" (2010) & the upcoming "Premium Rush" (2012) is brilliant! The art direction by David Stein (who also did the art direction to "He Got Game" (1998), "Arlington Road", "In The Cut" (2003), "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind" (2004), he was also an assistant art director to "Enchanted" (2007), "Duplicity" (2009), "It's Complicated" (2009) & the upcoming "Mr. Popper's Penguins" (2011) is brilliant! The set decoration by Tora Peterson (who also did the set decoration to "A Prairie Home Companion" (2006) is brilliant! The costume design by Amy Westcott (who also did the costume design to "The Squid And The Whale" (2005), "Smart People" (2008), "The Wrestler" & the upcoming "What's Your Number?" (2011) is brilliant!<br /><br />This is a brilliant film that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat at the same time. This is a well-made and well-crafted film. Darren Aronofsky has got another brilliant film on his hands. Natalie Portman gives a superb, Oscar-winning performance and Mila Kunis is just as impressive as her exact opposite. This is one of the best films of last year and it will be remembered when the Oscars are eventually announced.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Such a Beautiful and Talented Monster"></head><body><p>I don't think the Academy Awards people have had any trouble in choosing the winner for the best actress in a leading role, nor I think they took too much time to arrive at their decision,despite the other wonderful performances of the other nominees.<br />Anyone who watches Monster, and the mind blowing performance that is so gritty, real and totally involved and involving would not flinch for a second in presenting Charlize Theron with a truly deserved award!<br />The story itself, a biopic of infamous serial killer Aileen Wuornos, has been filmed before,(I don't think such a 'meaty' subject matter for a movie would had to wait till now to be filmed),but there is a difference..<br />For one, all credit should go to writer/director Patty Jenkins for her totally sympathetic and unsentimental treatment of the Wuornos story.She was more than capable of handling the complexity of emotions, with very visual as well as character based approach.<br />Although the story is told largely from Wuornos's point of view, the success that Jenkins manages to achieve is to win the viewer's sympathy for both killer and victims: there are no real monsters in Wuornos's story..just a very tragic life, a woman who has been abused for so long by family and 'customers' and neglected by society at large when she tried to 'go straight', pushing her back into the ending that she could not avoid.<br />And while the loss of lives of the innocent men she killed was totally inexcusable, the feeling I got from the film was that Aileen Wuornos was also dead long before she was executed.<br />A very powerful scene sees Wuornos in the back of a corrupt cop's car, allegedly booked for some complaint but picked up for sexual favors. She tries to pretend that she is having a day off from a normal 9 to 5 job,but then the cop revealing that he knows what she does for a living, replies sarcastically, do you go to church on your day off?<br />I find this scene extremely important because it shows how Wuornos tried to maintain her dignity as a human being but failed..very sad indeed.<br />The relationship between Aileen and Selby (played so well by Christina Ricci in one of the best roles so far) which is central to the whole story,was very well written. We know that Wuornos was not gay but someone who craved affection and love and (as she says in the film)can 'train' herself to love a woman to achieve a most desperate need to love and be loved.<br />I thought the love scenes were very well filmed, with enough passion between the two women, yet never gratuitous.<br />Now a word about the acting again..<br />Charlize Theron is not only one of the most beautiful women ever, but she is equally talented..She reminded me a bit of De Niro, Hoffman, Kidman or Streep, that kind of actor/actress who totally dedicates him/herself to his/her role, not only emotionally but physically as well..and had I not known she is playing the lead role, I would have been be excused even for few seconds for failing to recognize her..this is how great the physical transformation and likeness to the real Wuornos is.I would also like to mention that I real loved Pruitt Taylor Vince, one of the best actors in American Cinema today, and although his role was short, he as usual excelled.<br />So Monster is a real gem of a movie, a tragic story about the life of one woman who from early on had all the odds stacked against her, and at a moment of weakness unleashed demons that slowly took control of her, and had to pay dearly for it. A Must Buy!</p></body></html>

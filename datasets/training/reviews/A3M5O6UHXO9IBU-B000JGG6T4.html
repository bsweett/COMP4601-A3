Is he putting a bomb up a man's jacksy while spread eagled on a car bonnet or is he poaching eggs on his buns? I don't know. Denzil Washington is rumoured to be a black man. I see something vaguely dark whizzing accross the screen but it could be a flying wombat for all I can deduce. In fact, I'm not even looking at the screen. I'm in the bathroom getting an aspirin.<br /><br />Those of you who thought 'The Bourne Supremacy' featured the worst direction on a major motion picture in living memory will be truly gob-smacked by this picture. Tony Scott is an experienced director so he has no excuse for this unmitigated disaster. Studios are moaning about the downturn in box office and then make a film that nobody can look at when they actually venture into the cinema.<br /><br />It appears Mr Scott is miffed about the reception his over-long revenge saga 'Revenge' got at the afore-mentioned box office and really wants to punish us this time. A man goes to a foreign country and murders a whole bunch of people for a crime it turned out they were not actually guilty of (sounds familiar?) and the writer wants us to get all sentimental about him. And could someone PLEASE allow Dakota Fanning to have a childhood instead of grooming her to act like a mini adult. It is really creepy.<br /><br />You have got to admire the sheer chutzpuh of the tribute to Mexico City tacked on at the end of this movie. It is also the only part of the film that is thankfully still.</p></body></html>

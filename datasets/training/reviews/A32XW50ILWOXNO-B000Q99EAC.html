It strains to be about a character and not the size of Stallone's oiled muscles.<br /><br />"Rocky V" treaded this ground, too, but crumbled under its overwhelming sentimentality. "Rocky Balboa" is a simpler creation, more of a meditation on aging than a boxing flick. I liked it. It's humble and sincere; Stallone seeks to give purpose to life after 50 but has stopped trying to butter up his own image. Rocky's not ending racism or slurring for an end to the Cold War. He's just a "yo" with an itch to box.<br /><br />Because actress Talia Shire refused to return to the franchise, the storyline reveals that Rocky's wife, Adrian, has died from cancer. Rocky mourns weekly at her gravestone. And he's named a restaurant after her. It's a cozy place where Rocky can tell stories and nurse wounds. Somewhat estranged from his son (Milo Ventimiglia), Rocky spends hours haunting South Philadelphia with Paulie (Burt Young).<br /><br />His routine changes when he runs into neighborhood girl Marie (Geraldine Hughes). Marie's a bit of a love interest, but more an opportunity for Rocky to reconnect with the outer world. Once he does, he senses a "beast" inside. It says, "Box."<br /><br />And he'll get his shot in an exhibition against the heavyweight champion. Stallone makes this ridiculous scenario borderline plausible - just look at the state of boxing, and you have to admit it might happen - by integrating ESPN and HBO TV personalities into the screenplay.<br /><br />The fight itself - against Mason "The Line" Dixon - is a schizophrenic mix of a HBO broadcast and "Raging Bull" choreography. But the rest of "Rocky Balboa" is crafted with restraint. Gone are the endless matching shots and music video editing from Stallone's earlier efforts. This is a decent and measured close to a series that deserved a little better</p></body></html>

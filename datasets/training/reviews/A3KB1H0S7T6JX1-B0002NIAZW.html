<meta name="summary" content="A movie worth watching!"></head><body><p>The Day After Tomorrow brings to the screen the likely scenario that the planet can no longer take the punishment inflicted on it by mankind and begins going through a process of rapid climatic changes, which threatens life on Earth.  The likelihood of such a phenomenon is presently great indeed and hopefully the film will get many people thinking.<br /><br />The movie has very good special effects i.e. very realistic, and a much needed message of the dangers of the Green House Effect.<br /><br />My only reservation is in relation to the plot, and specifically in relation to the "duty bound" mother/doctor and her unrealistic "devotion" to her patient at a time when the world is falling apart while her husband and son are out of reach (Has she no parents of her own/brothers-sisters?).  In addition, the top scientist/father (Dennis Quaid) with access to the high-ups in the White House and contacts across the world, drops everything in an instant and begins a trek walking from DC to NYC in search of his son...  (Has he no parents of his own/brothers-sisters?)  Moreover, people like that are usually kept under guard for "National Security" reasons, especially at a time when their services are of outmost importance to their country.  So it's plot-wise that I believe that there are some weaknesses.<br /><br />As a result, I am going to agree with a previous reviewer and quote him by saying "Good Effects, Bad Plot!"  It is a very good movie, it's an eye opener, definitely moving, and worth watching.<br /><br />In short, it is my belief that the movie deserves 4 stars for the top quality, entertainment and messages it provides, but falls short of 5 stars for the weakness in the plot.</p></body></html>

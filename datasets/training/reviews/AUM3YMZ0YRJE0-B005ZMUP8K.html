<meta name="summary" content="OK, but lacks its own magic"></head><body><p>While I love some of my kids' films, such as the Harry Potter series, Depp's Pirate series does very little for me.  It is very hard for me to get into it, to believe it while I am watching it with them.  They absolutely love the raucous nuttiness of it, the impossible feats, and the outlandish characters as they switch sides and pursue interests impossible to fathom.  I envy the way they scream and laugh as they watch it, so I am glad to have them put it on.  But the way we use it at home is to get them out of our way so that we can do things around the house rather than as a family viewing experience.  I find the battles tedious, the characters and situations unbelievable, and somehow lacking in spirit, like it was written by a marketing committee rather than conceived as a story.  I also find the acting rather flat and unengaging, which is unfortunate given the quality of the cast.  I guess this reflects the fact that the film idea comes from an existing ride in the theme park rather than a story that on its own inspired a new theme-park experience.  So my wife and I are willing to put up with this as background noise.</p></body></html>

The cast is strong containing several well known rising stars, the production values superior and the villians particularily unnerving. Of course all splatter films must conform to and ultimately be judged by the tried and true, time tested splatter essentials.<br /><br />Splatter Essentials:<br />1- Sex Factor: The six targeted young victims are equally divided into three attractive girls (Eliza Dushku, Emmanuelle Chriqui and Lindy Booth) and three good looking guys (Desmond Harrington, Jeremy Sisto and Scott Zeger) providing the viewing audience a nice selection of male and female favorites to root for.<br />2- Creep Factor: The backwoods cannibals are very high on the creep meter, especially Three Fingers (Julian Richings). You're certain to see that face in your dreams a few times after watching the film.<br />3- Gross Factor: There are some very graphic and violent scenes that score high on the gross meter, be prepared.<br />4- Predictability Factor: Yes, it is predictable but that's part of the beauty of this genre of film. You know who's going to die, you're just waiting to see who gets it next and what's the method of their demise.<br /><br />While this is not one of my favorite film genres I have to admit that I liked this one.</p></body></html>

She has a supportive husband (Edwards) and a capable psychologist (Sinise), and is making progress towards acceptance.  Then, suddenly, little things start to happen.  Her car is parked in a different space than where she left it.  A cup of coffee she is drinking disappears.  These events concern her, but it isn't until her son's things start to disappear that she really freaks out.  All of a sudden no one seems to remember her son, although the memories are quite clear to her.  Teaming up with the father of a girl who was killed in the same accident as her son, Telly sets out to figure out just what is going on.  And that is as far as I will go story-wise, because I don't want to give too much away.<br /><br />Moore does a good job as the grieving mother who is determined to get to the bottom of this mystery.  In fact, she gives the stand out performance in this movie.  The special effects, when used are very effective, especially the "snatching" effect seen in the previews.  The story is interesting, but fails somewhere along the way to really make sense.  When everything is revealed, it does not entirely support what has gone before, and the "happy ending" that is tacked onto the end really makes no sense at all...it just serves as a giant "reset button" that seems cheap.  The point of the story is nice though, and that gives it some points in my book.  All in all, I would recommend waiting for DVD on this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="BETTER THAN I EXPECTED"></head><body><p>As with the book, I had problems with the movie trying to explain the evolution of a monster. Sometimes, when the mystery is removed, especially when it is done in such a pedestrian fashion ( where all the pieces fit into perfect little boxes ) as is the case here, the plot doesn't thicken- it congeals. That said, the film moved along at a crisp pace, the acting was good ( though no one can replace Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal ), and the cinematography was quite good. It was far from boring.</p></body></html>

If you judge a film by the amount of copious fluids you excrete from your person then "Team America-World Police" is an outright masterpiece.  All kidding aside, this was the funniest film of 2004 and will inevitably achieve classic status.  This is probably the crowning moment of Parker and Stone's repertoire.  The beauty of this film is that I know both liberals and conservatives who are just as effusive in their fervor for this film.  The film's targets, global politics, Hollywood activism, high-voltage action films to name a few, are skewered brilliantly.  The puppets are stunning and expressive.  The miniature sets and visuals are breath-taking.  Like other Parker and Stone ventures the film has a great song score.  If you're not easily offended or have a slightly askew sense of humor "Team America" is the film for you.  Dirka, Dirka!</p></body></html>

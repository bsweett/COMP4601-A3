<meta name="summary" content="Eye Opening, Tragic -"></head><body><p>Model Charlize Theron plays an abused girl (Aileen Wuornos) who grew up to become a homeless, mentally-disturbed, slow-witted prostitute, and ultimately becomes a serial killer. Early in the film she meets Selby Wall, just beginning to accept her lesbianism. Theron tries to stop 'hooking,' but cannot get a 'regular job.' Returning to her prime expertise, she encounters a dangerous customer who severely beats her. Theron escapes her ties and shoots/kills him.<br /><br />Done once, it becomes too easy to repeat as an easier source of money. Eventually she kills a total of seven, is caught, convicted with the assistance of Wall (in exchange for immunity), and ultimately executed after 12 years on Death Row. While three psychiatrists concluded she was sane, her behavior suggested otherwise at the end.<br /><br />Further research establishes that Wuornos never met her father because he was in prison for rape/attempted murder of a 7-year-old girl when she was born. He subsequently hanged himself, Wuornos and her brother were placed in the custody of their grandparents. Both the grandfather and her brother had sex with her, as well as others in school. At 15 she was thrown out of the house. More prostitution, an armed robbery, forged checks, and a failed marriage to a 69-year-old followed.<br /><br />Watching all the violence was not enjoyable; however, it provided insight into the reality of those with severely diminished mental capacities.</p></body></html>

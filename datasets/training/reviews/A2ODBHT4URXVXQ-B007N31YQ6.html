Plus: I've seen it twice on cross-country plane trips, once in the local theater, and once on home video. Lordy!<br />Anyway...<br />This fact-based movie earned Julia Roberts an Oscar, deservedly. It captured her ability for slapstick, pathos, drama, etc. Twice-divorced and flat broke Brokovich forces her way into a job in the office of a lawyer who failed to win her a big award in a traffic accident injury case, then goes on to make herself indispensible in the investigation of toxic chromium contamination of the groundwater of little no-place, no-count Hinkley, California, where locals have suffered a plague of pain, death and disease. With her common-folk ways, she succeeds in winning the confidence of 100% of the distrustful and jaded populance - and a huge award in a personal injury case against big business.<br />5 stars for the movie, 5 stars for Brokovich and J. Roberts, 5 stars for the little guys of the world who triumph against the big bucks of corporate arrogance.</p></body></html>

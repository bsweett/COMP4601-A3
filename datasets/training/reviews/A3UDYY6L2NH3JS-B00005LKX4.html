<meta name="summary" content="Hannibal Lecter is profiling the FBI"></head><body><p>I was kind of disappointed by the film at first because it cuts off the second half of the book, the part I definitely preferred because it showed so well there is a real love affair going on between the criminal and the cop who is tracking him. Catching a serial killer is the story of a seduction : the seducing of the cop and the seducing of the killer by the other proponent in each case. But the film has qualities that are undeniable. It is a good thriller, though a little bit fast and consequently skimpy. The end is gross, even if the alternative ending is a lot better, because it keeps the main door open. The official ending closes all doors and locks them up so tight there is no escape from the horror this Hannibal inspires in Clarisse, respect, maybe or of course, but horror all the same. It explores a little bit the extreme culture of this man, his phenomenal way to impersonate practically anyone and charm practically any audience. He is a man who can be on the alert all the time and knows what his opponents are going to do next, even before they know themselves. It is funny how he is not at all disquieted by his being caught by his old high school or university gay offering to the God of death and style, because he knows this Mason has made a mistake : he has called him back by endangering Clarisse and she will know why she has been endangered and by whom, and she will react according to her instinct, she will come after him, Hannibal, because she cannot even doubt he is at stake and she was the bait, and she has to capture him alive, hence to go into the hornet's nest to get him free and then arrest him. That is not going to work exactly like that but the reducing of the rotten justice department offcial to a mumbling kid if not baboon is such a nice thing to see. A young promising man who cannot resist his fascination for easy money and endangers his own colleagues, even uses them as bait and nothing but trap-meat. That is what our system of containing evil instead of reforming it leads to. There is always someone who will take advantage of the situation. That is western corruption and we are experts at it. At the same time this film, for the second time (Red Dragon proved the contrary but The Silence of the Lambs went the opposite way), proves that the famous FBI profiling technique is just a gimmick in the technology of crime-fighting and nothing else. A real serial killer is intelligent enough to foresee what the police is going to do and thus to lead them along the way instead of being trapped by their profiling. A real serial killer is also able to check all computers and sites and know that someone has put their greasy fingers in some files that concern him. If he buys a certain perfume in some luxury boutique anywhere in the world, he wants it to be an indicator of his whereabout to get out of the police what he wants, because he knows there is a camera filming hom and a simple mirror will tell him he is being watched. And he always succeeds because teh police works serially too and very little creatively. He does not want to stay in hiding. He wants to come out and act, so he calculates the action he desires and wishes and he pulls all the strings. It is a shame that the film cuts off the second part of the book and makes it impossible for Hannibal to get out of the chase, but it is a good film and the book is quite different with a serial killer who finally wants to get out of it and tries, maybe succeeds, to do so. Watch and enjoy the film, then read the book and enjoy the difference. Then enjoy the second disk, the alternative or rejected scenes (probably not all of them), the making of, and many other elements. You'll learn a lot about filmmaking and that will give some depth to your pleasure. We are finally reaching the acme of visual art by being provided with the backstage scenes and the backroom discussions. The cinema with the DVD is becoming like the Bible with the fingerprints of Jesus and his full authentic biography certified by the Roman Emperor himself and at least two dozens of eye-witnesses testifying under oath in some Supreme Court of Historical Truth.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

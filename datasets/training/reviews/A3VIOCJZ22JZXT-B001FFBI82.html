In Black Hawk Down, the war action never ends, whereas in Jarhead it never seems to start. Thus Jarhead focuses on the preparation for war, the boredom waiting for war, and the irony of fighting a war at the fringe if the action.<br /><br />The film seemed to wish to make a statement about young male soldiers - what makes them tick. In this regard, the film succeeds. The film depicts these young 19 and 20 year old fellows as nieve about the world and yet foolishly cocky. These fellows were under educated and under achievers from rural areas or the inner city. They were not the sons of doctors and lawyers from the suburbs. They were influenced by a substance called testosterone that fuels aggressive blood lust and wild mood swings. They also are subject to the effects of alcohol, which we all know does not mix well with testosterone. Yet, they are also pack driven and eventually fall in line under the direction of an alpha male, played very well by Jamie Foxx in this film.<br /><br />The film also casts a jaundiced eye toward military leadership. These young men were not really prepared for war, despite their bravado. The malfunction of equipment, such as gas masks and communication equipment, was a constant running joke in the film. Those who know just how much tax payers must pay for such useless broken equipment to military contractors realize this is far from a joke.<br /><br />The story or plot involves a group of soldiers waiting to fight, always on the edges of the action, and thus they experience such adventures and finding thousands of burned Iraqi vehicles and charred bodies; or nomads complaining of shot camels; or a desert of black burning oil fields.<br /><br />I think that this is one of those films, like Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, that get better with age and distance. With time the film will be seen as a film about the young male Marine, and not a political statement about our conflicts in Iraq.  The title "Jarhead" should lead us to the real purpose of this film.</p></body></html>

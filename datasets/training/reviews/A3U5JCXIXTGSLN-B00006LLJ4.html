Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, a police captain who works for the &quot;Precrime&quot; division of the police department in Washingto D.C. in the year 2054. Because of the Precrime experiment/department, there has not been one murder in D.C. in six years. Three humans who are kept in liquid called &quot;precogs&quot; have visions of crimes that are about to happen. Anderton and his collegues then use that information to prevent murders all over the city. This procedure seems foolproof until Anderton realizes that he is next in line to murder someone. The tables turn.<p>&quot;Minority Report&quot; is a futuristic film that doesn't bore you with a lot of scientific jargon or far-fetched ideas. The thought of murders being prevented alone draws you into this film. Steven Spielberg does an excellent job of showing a futuristic Washington D.C. without it looking fake and silly. The story will also keep you glued. There is the obvious story of the precrime division, a backstory regarding Anderton's son who was kidnapped and has been missing for the past 6 years, and the story of Anderton trying to figure out why he is going to kill someone he has never met. Believe me, this movie will keep you glued to the screen!<p>I would highly recommend this film. Not only is is visually interesting, but the story and performances are incredible!</p></body></html>

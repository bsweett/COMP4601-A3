<meta name="summary" content=""The Gunpowder Plot" all over again..."></head><body><p>I have to say that I am not familiar with any of the comics, or had had any other contact with the characters apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" of V prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!<br />V for Vendetta brings to the screen the not-so-impossible scenario that in the future England (or any western country for that matter) has become a dictatorship.  Subsequently, a man idolizing a 1605 failed attempt by Guy Fawkes to blow up the English parliament takes it upon himself to start a revolution in order to bring down the regime.  What the revolutionary does not anticipate is to find love in the midst of it all...  It's a bit like the X-Files meets "1984" with a bit of Matrix, and all that in a Marvel Comics universe.<br />On the positive side:<br />Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea, John Hurt, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!<br />Moreover, the special effects are pretty good.<br />On the negative side:<br />The film is way too political and too radical for the comics genre.<br />In addition, as in the case of the Michael Moore films, there are good and valid points, but the approach used is so radical and extreme that to a certain extent it backfires and may have the opposite effects.<br />Ridiculing law and order by portraying frequent curfews and constantly stating that they "are for your protection," may encourage lawlessness and anarchy.  Furthermore, the film comes to the defence of certain groups and minorities that mainstream people and common folk do not feel close or akin to, thus scaring them away from pressing matters such as who controls the media (which is something that is presented well in the film).<br />In a nutshell, V for Vendetta may not be a terrible movie, but it's also not what they've made it out to be.</p></body></html>

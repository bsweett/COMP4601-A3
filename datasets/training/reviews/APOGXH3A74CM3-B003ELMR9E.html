To the point where his judgment is impaired by his lack of sleep and the line between right and wrong is blurred.  <p>Al Pacino is so convincing in his role, that anyone who has suffered insomnia should be able to relate.<p>To top off Pacino's performance was the brilliant casting of lovable Robin Williams as the antagonist!  Williams' performance is chilling!<p>Add the beautiful scenery and interesting story, and you get a thriller that's worth losing some sleep over!</p></body></html>

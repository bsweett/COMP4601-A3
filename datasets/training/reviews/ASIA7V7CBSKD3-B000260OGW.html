<meta name="summary" content="Good Western"></head><body><p>Being a fan of Westerns, Bob Duvall, and Kevin Costner, guess what?  I like this movie.  I had heard the movie was not that great and did not see it in the theatres.  I finally got it once it came out on DVD and very much enjoyed the movie.  If you like Westerns or any of the actors in it, then you will like "Open Range."</p></body></html>

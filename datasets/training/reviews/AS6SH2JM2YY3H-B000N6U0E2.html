<meta name="summary" content="Not a "feel good" movie...  a powerful drama"></head><body><p>In The Pursuit of Happyness, Chris Gardner (played by Will Smith) goes from being an out-of-luck medical appliance salesman to an intern at a major brokerage firm.  This happens while he is a single father, loses his home, and literally lives out of his suitcase.<br /><br />It is a movie that focuses on determination and perseverance, and love.<br /><br />I understand this is a fictionalized account of the real Chris Gardner, currently a multimillionaire philanthropist and motivational speaker.  His path to fame and fortune was rough, and that is what was portrayed by Smith in this movie.  As Gardner (Smith) faces challenge after challenge, his son, Christopher (played by Will Smith's own son), is right there with him, going from apartment to hotel to homeless shelter.  The personal agonies hit you in the gut, so that the viewer is left with an unsatisfying... guilt?  Fear?  Many viewers cannot understand the impact of seeing a five dollar bill leave your pocket, knowing that the bill represents food for the day, now gone.<br /><br />And when Gardner receives the competitive six month internship (yay), hears that only one of the twenty interns will be hired (brrrr), and finds out that interns are not paid a penny during that period (ouch), you will feel his angst.<br /><br />Watching Gardner's frustrations and trials was almost voyeuristic.  I wish there was more of a catharsis ("a release of emotional tension, as after an overwhelming experience, that restores or refreshes the spirit") at the end to give my stomach a chance to recover.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Adventure Film, Done Right"></head><body><p>What a magnificent adventure story, pure and simple.<br /><br />It's unusual in that there are only two action scenes over the 2 hour, 19-minute film, one near the beginning and one near the end. They don't go on that long, either. For a modern-day film, that's very unusual.<br /><br />However, that doesn't translate to infer this is too talky or boring. The film will keep your interest all the way. However, for any ladies out there looking for a bit romance in this tale, it isn't there. In that respect, unless you want to ogle at Russell Crowe, this a man's film with an all-male cast.<br /><br />This movie is a great demo on how to make an adventure film fascinating without blood and guts and explosions every two minutes. It's an heroic tale, right down a little boy who shows us what guts are all about. One tip for those having trouble with some of the accents or naval terminology: put on the English subtitles. You'll be glad you did.<br /><br />This movie won the Academy Award for both cinematography and sound and both honors were well-deserved. The creaking of the ship coming out of all the surround speakers is awesome, just in itself. I was so pumped to see this on Blu-Ray, but the transfer wasn't much better than the regular DVD, so save your money on that one.</p></body></html>

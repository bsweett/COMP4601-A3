<meta name="summary" content="The Bigest Piece Of Crap Ive Ever Seen"></head><body><p>Pitch Black was no masterpiece but atleast it had some mystery and maintained some moments of unpredictability. here in this suposed sequel we have an over blown big budget sequel that doesnt resemble the original in anyway.<br /><br />this sequel takes place some years after the events of the first movie. this time around Riddick is on the run from some mercenaries who want to capture him alive. Riddick in search of refugee finds help from one of the survivors of the first movie Abu "Imam" al-Walid (Keith David) it seems the refugee is futile, this is due to the unexpected attack by some outlanders known as Necromongers; their task is to conquer,conquer like the romans..funny thing is they are dressed in a similiar fashion.<br /><br />anyways the movie does have some good points,such as descent visual effects,nicely choreographed fight scenes. but the rest is stupidity beyond imagination. the acting is stale,the lines are that of someone with no experience. the ending is abrupt and tedious. Its beyond me how both Thandie Newton and Judi Dench acepted to work in this garbage. as i said the effects are cool,so is the designing of the whole movie...but thats it;the remaining of the film is just crap and more crap. the editing is also very cheap..which is wierd for a big budget movie like this one. just watch it if you are a fan of the first,dont exprect a masterpiece,expect a dumb sci-fi movie.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 1 OUT OF 5</p></body></html>

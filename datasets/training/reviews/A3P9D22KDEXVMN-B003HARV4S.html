<meta name="summary" content="Do Not Be Fooled; This Movie is Excellent"></head><body><p>The Illusionist features excellent performances by Edward Norton as Eisenheim, Paul Giamatti as the Chief Police Inspector, and Rufus Sewell as the evil Crown Prince Leopold.  The leads play off each other to extraordinary effect.  The plot is brilliant, and fascinating.  I was also very impressed with Jessica Biel who was radiant in the movie.  A supernatural feel permeates the film as Eisenheim captures audiences with his baffling "tricks."<br /><br />There has been much said about the fact that The Illusionist was released around the same time (it was released first) as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC55F2">The Prestige</a>; however, having enjoyed both films very much, I give the nod to this film.  I was very entertained and thought the time spent watching this movie was worth it.  The turn of the century Vienna scenery was visually pleasing. Edward Norton continues to be one of the finest actors in the industry.<br /><br />I highly recommend this five star movie.</p></body></html>

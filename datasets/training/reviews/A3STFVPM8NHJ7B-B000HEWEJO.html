I can understand people complaining about this little trinket, it's nothing really speical. If your a fan if this film you'll remember the angel saying every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings. That's the reason, I believe, for the bell. The package is wrapped in soft, red fabric but it can easily be ruined but it does look nice.<br /><br />The movie itself is considered a classic. My only problem with the film is it told George's story very well and Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey did a great job. The movie took over an hour to tell the story of Bailey's life but the angel comes in and the story rushes along. The ending was magical to say the least but I wish they took more time to do the ending.<br /><br />The movie is well worth the price it's an American classic. As long as dvd's and blu-ray and whatever comes after that exist, movie companies will always release the same dvds over and over again.</p></body></html>

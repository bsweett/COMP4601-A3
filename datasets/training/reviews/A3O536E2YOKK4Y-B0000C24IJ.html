They soon discover they are prey to inbred hillbillies who may be mutant and resistant to pain. Will they get out alive?<br /><br />My wife's response to the film was a disturbed "I'm never going in the woods again!" By contrast, I felt it was entertaining and compelling but not scary or horrifying. Why? Because, although the story is presented in a serious, non-campy manner it's not realistic. The reason "Deliverance" (1972) was so unsettling is because the story actually COULD happen. "Wrong Turn" starts out this way but becomes increasingly unbelievable as the story unravels. Hence, unlike "Deliverance," I could never buy that I was viewing a potential reality.<br /><br />Yet it starts out with enough believability that I was drawn into the story and the characters. By the time the unrealistic stuff starts happening it didn't matter because the film successfully captures and maintains your attention. It's not a great film by any means, but it's decent for what it is, a slasher-in-the-woods flick.<br /><br />I'm not usually a fan of slasher flicks in general, nor am I a gorehound, but I do love the "Friday the 13th" movies and films of the same ilk. I enjoy the youthful casts and the deep woods setting. It brings fond memories of my younger years (camping, hiking, etc.). The fact that there's a mad killer(s) on the loose just adds excitement and suspense. However, I never find these films scary. Fun? Yes. A little creepy? Yes. A few shocking moments? Yes. Scary or horrifying? No. But my wife obviously disagrees because, again, she never wants to go in the woods again, lol.<br /><br />"Wrong Turn" was filmed in Dundas and Uxbridge, Ontario, with additional footage shot in Toronto and Hamilton (which I'm assuming is studio work since there are no urban scenes in the film). This area of Ontario has deep forests but is largely flat as many of the geographical-overlook shots reveal, but there are a couple of shots where you'll see hills in the background (which I'm not sure are authentic or cgi). There's also some nice footage of cliffs and a waterfall at the 1 hour 5 minute mark that I really enjoyed. These locations are fine but it would have been better if they actually filmed in Appalachia (it's only about 500 miles south of Ontario, after all).<br /><br />As far as the cast goes, Desmond Harrington is a great leading male protagonist. He has character and isn't a smart-axx delinquent. He should go on to better things. Eliza Dushku is good as his main companion, not to mention easy on the eyes, although she has no booty (maybe if she ate more). Jeremy Sisto and Emmanuelle Chriqui are also good protagonists. It's just nice to have a group of people you can care about and root for, rather than a bunch of unappealing and crude punks, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />Another good thing about the film is it only runs an hour and 20 minutes before the credits role. Movies like this should't go on too long; it's unnecessary. Speaking of the credits, they feature a really good modern rock/metal song.<br /><br />One other aspect I enjoyed is a 10-15 minute sequence that takes place high up in the trees at night as three of the kids try to evade the hillbillies (which I'm assuming was shot in the studio, but I'm not sure). The sequence isn't believable at all but it is quite original. I wasn't expecting that.<br /><br />PERSONAL GRADE: C+</p></body></html>

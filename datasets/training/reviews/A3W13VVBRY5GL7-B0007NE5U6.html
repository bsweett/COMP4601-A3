Sad, then, that this movie adaptation of that novel lacks almost all of the warmth and wit of the book, replacing it instead with schmaltz and tired stereotyping, histrionic set-pieces and truly predictable comedy.<br /><br />Bridget is now in a relationship with Mark Darcey and the Daniel Cleaver affair seems to be well and truly behind her. Her career is going well and her friends are jealous. So far, so good. Suddenly, she and Mark break up, she and Daniel are sent to Thailand together, she's framed for cocaine smuggling, and unless her friend Shazzer can alert Mark in time, it'll all end in tears.<br /><br />Except after the first thirty minutes or so, the sugary sweetness and blind mundanity of the movie we just don't care how it ends.<br /><br />Zellwegger's accent and performance mannerisms are once more flawless in their British impersonation, and she does what she can with a truly uninspiring script. Firth as Mark Darcey is the same as before, except now almost totally one-dimensional, lacking any of the depth of either the novel or the original movie. Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver is now a totally transparent character, and the movie-invented TV show he hosts does not serve any purpose other than to showcase his soullessness - a trait which we were already well aware of, why underline it here? - and at the movie's end we do find ourselves wondering what the point of including him in the screenplay was.<br /><br />Not that these are bad actors, you understand - this is the fault of a lousy script that relies far too heavily on schmaltzy emotion and a gross underestimation of the audiences' intelligence levels. Devoid of all subtlety and warmth, the movie  rattles on to a cheesy and predictable close, but by that stage, you may well have switched off before the inexorable happy ending.<br /><br />One to avoid, read the novel instead.</p></body></html>

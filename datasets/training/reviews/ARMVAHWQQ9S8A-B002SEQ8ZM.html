<meta name="summary" content="Best Looking Stop-Motion Flick So Far"></head><body><p>CORALINE is by far the best example of stop motion I've ever seen.  While the look of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUOU">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a> wears with time, this is just perfectly smooth.  The colors are beautiful and the movement is gracious.  The film itself is disturbing in all the good ways, and the story is surprisingly dark and creepy considering it's essentially a children's movie.  The best way I can describe the feel of CORALINE is this.  Imagine if a creepier version of Pixar, known for making intelligent movies with strong themes that are thought-provoking for adults but still accessible for children, made a stop-motion flick.<br /><br />A lot of fans, ignorant to the fact that Tim Burton PRODUCED <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUOU">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>, not directed it, will be fooled by the "from the director of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUOU">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>" label on this film.  So it will definitely get the Burton crowd.  But, by and large, the story and visuals are superior to Burton's work.  Since it's adapted from Neil Gaiman's popular book, which I unfortunately didn't get a chance to read before I saw the film, you know you can trust to be told a delightfully creepy tale.  The movie does find a nice balance between keeping the visuals stunning and maintaining the integrity of Gaiman's story.<br /><br />So far, this seems like a glowing review.  It's coming out that way because the film definitely has a lot going for it.  The animation deserves praise, the script is good, and the voice acting (which I haven't mentioned) is also great.  But, even at one-hundred minutes, this film feels way too long.  I was bored in parts, and felt that the movie could have lost fifteen minutes without losing a shred of its complexity.  I still enjoyed it, and wouldn't mind seeing it again.  Not sure if it's worth owning on DVD unless you're a huge animation fan or really dig Gaiman's work, but it's at least worth a rent!<br /><br />7/10</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mindless Fun"></head><body><p>ACTUAL RATING: 3-1/2 stars (come on, Amazon, give us the halves!)<br /><br />This is like a dumbed down American Pie (star John Cho is an alumnus of that film). It's stupid, juvenile, about as deep as a puddle, contains loads of jokes recycled from other slob comedies, and will stick with you about as long as a Big Mac and fries from MacDonalds (sorry, White Castle). However, the film does have a undeniable spirit of fun and there are some genuine big laughs throughout. It's certainly never boring. The producers clearly didn't intend to make another Schindler's List. They set out to make an enjoyable, entertaining romp and, to that end, they succeeded in spades.<br /><br />NOTE: I really hope, for Neil Patrick Harris' sake, that this isn't the best role he can get these days.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Path to Adulthood"></head><body><p>What makes this film a classic is how the sterotypical settings of life are depicted in an originality devoid of stereotype; this is a path which truly can be seen, touched and felt.<br /><br />While tackling the topic of teen pregnancy, the exploration of the daily race and grind - the track metaphor in the film is fitting - in what actually leads to graduating into adulthood is very real.<br /><br />The trails in life are plenty and Juno is a wonderful portrait in motion.</p></body></html>

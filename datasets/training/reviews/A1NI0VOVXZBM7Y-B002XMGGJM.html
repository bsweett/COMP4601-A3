<meta name="summary" content="Law Abiding Citizen."></head><body><p>Law Abiding Citizen is in the Mold of Dirty Harry And Deathwish Movies(Although those are much better in my Opinion),Gerald Butler Did a great performance as did Jaime Foxx,but I think Butler stole the movie,I don't think the way he went about it,Instead of focusing on Just the evil he went all out and that wasn't cool, I don't condone the actions, I felt he should have just gotten the perp in the movie. Either way the movie's ending and just the way Butler's Character just gets out of hand I disliked,but the Idea itself behind the movie that The Justice System favors the Criminal's right before the Victims in most cases speaks volumes and there is truth to that,<br />When you have Liberals running the show,Activist judges and so fourth who want "Rehab" Instead of Minimum Mandatory Life Sentences for Violent Offenders/Repeat offenders. All In All the movie is worth watching as painful as it may seem,not exactly the best thing for Butler to have done.</p></body></html>

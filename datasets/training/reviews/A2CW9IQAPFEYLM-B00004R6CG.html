James Stewart plays a forced-to-retire detective (he has a fear of heights) who is hired by an old college chum (played by Tom Helmore) to watch his wife (Kim Novak); he's afraid she's living a life in the past, assuming the life of a woman who committed suicide in 1857 or so, with her own life in danger. Stewart falls in love with her and one night they re-enact a scene from her supposed past in the tower of a church. The twists and turns of the plot lead to a big surprise and a desire by Stewart for Novak to "become" again who she was in the past. (It's convoluted and hard to explain without spoiling the surprises.) It's here where Hitchcock is most autobiographical, and it has to do with Vera Miles who Hitch wanted to star in this movie, but who had married and become pregnant, with the role then going to Novak. Thus he attempted to recreate Novak in the image of Miles, similar to what Stewart does to her in the movie as the characters they play. Regardless of all this, it's a great movie. The story is terrific, with a great climactic ending, and the psychological complications are intriguing. The use of new technology to get that dizzying effect caused by Stewart's vertigo was invented and used for the first time in this movie. Definitely worth a watch.</p></body></html>

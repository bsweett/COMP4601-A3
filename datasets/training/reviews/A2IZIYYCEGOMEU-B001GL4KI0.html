True, the story is a rather pastiche affair, and the dialogue can sometimes be a bit over-cooked, but damn!- Milla is fun to watch! Oddly enough, I was apparently one of the few that viewed this pic without expecting it to be on a par with CITIZEN KANE ( though I am a huge fan of Welles' classic ). If you enjoy watching fun, somewhat over-the-top fight scenes, with a very easy-on-the-eyes, kickass heroine, good color, and non-stop action, this might be right up your alley. If, however, you're looking for Lawrence Olivier's version of HAMLET, this ain't it.</p></body></html>

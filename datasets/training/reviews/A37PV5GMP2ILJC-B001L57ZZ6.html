<meta name="summary" content="The eagle has landed"></head><body><p>... with a thud!<br /><br />While this movie gets high marks for almost non-stop action and cute lead characters, the high-tech plot is so outrageous that you'll have to catch your jaw before it hits the floor.<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. The President of the United States makes a hasty decision which causes a big backlash and many retaliatory casualties. (Okay, maybe some parts aren't that far-fetched after all)<br />2. Big sister is watching<br />3. Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) comes back from his brother's funeral to find that his bank account has been mysteriously enriched, and his apartment full of packages that didn't come from Amazon.com<br />4. Unlike Neo in The Matrix, he fails to heed a mysterious warning over the telephone, and finds himself answering to the FBI (Billy Bob Thornton) and the Air Force (Rosario Dawson)<br />5. Before long, he's running at breakneck speed to do the bidding of a mysterious female voice, and is joined by a single mother named Rachel (Michelle Monaghan)<br />6. Large stretching of the imagination required from here in<br />7. High speed chases and lots of computer hi-jinks follow<br />8. Lame ending signals end of movie<br /><br />This techno-thriller is just fine for action-junkies who can suspend disbelief in exchange for a fast-paced thriller with attractive young stars, but try not to stop and think about the plot too much.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 21, 2008</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Generic Alzheimer's framing device undermines shaky Thatcher biopic"></head><body><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />No matter how good an actor's performance is (and in this case, Meryl Streep's performance is excellent), if the script is weak, the movie as a whole, cannot work. And that's what's happened with 'The Iron Lady'. Director Phyllida Lloyd and Screenwriter Abi Morgan want it both ways. On one hand, they have a great reverence for Margaret Thatcher as a feminist pioneer who became Britian's first female prime minister. On the other hand, being liberals, they've got to be uncomfortable with Thatcher's conservative political stance (to many liberals, in her heyday, Thatcher was viewed as a modern day 'Marie Antoinette').<br /><br />On the surface, Lloyd and Morgan have produced a fairly standard biopic--a hagiography of sorts, touching on Thatcher's storied political career. But I would argue that because of their unease with Thatcher's belief system, they unconsciously attempt to disparage her. Lloyd and Morgan end up focusing on Thatcher in her old age, ravaged by Alzheimer's, and a shell of her former self. Thatcher is now transformed into a tragic figure, and whatever Lloyd and Morgan's underlying intentions, the net effect is to constantly remind us that a woman who once was a firebrand, has now been taken down quite a few pegs.<br /><br />It's one thing to deal with the reality of Thatcher's dementia, but to focus on it, as the main focus of the film, that's a big mistake. Why do we have to be constantly reminded of Thatcher's fall from grace? This could be a story about ANYONE with Alzheimer's! The Weinstein Brothers already covered the subject matter with their 2001 film, 'Iris' starring Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent (note Broadbent shows up here in virtually the same kind of role--the understanding husband who must cope with a wife in sad decline!) . And yes we know that Alzheimer's is a terrible thing but to knock us over the head scene after scene (with Thatcher experiencing hallucinations of her dead husband), that takes away from the material we're really interested in: Thatcher's rise to power and subsequent political career.<br /><br />Granted, it is a tall order to turn the story of Thatcher's political career into compelling drama; but Abi Morgan is clearly not up to the task. What the script lacks is basic conflict, with a recognizable external arc, culminating in a resolution to the protagonist's dark moment. 'The Iron Lady' works best when Thatcher battles her allies in the Conservative party, but those moments are fleeting. Her opponents are underdeveloped--on for such a short time that the film feels more like a History Channel biography than full fledged drama. Instead, we're treated to archival footage, chronicling the frenzied opposition to Thatcher's policies through the years, as well as realistic (but again, short) scenes in Parliament, where we never get to know any of the Labor opponents as fleshed out characters.<br /><br />Individual scenes do occasionally work. When a bespectacled Harry Lloyd (the young Denis Thatcher) proposes to Alexandra Roach (the young Margaret), the young actors capture the unbridled innocence of the young couple about to embark on their life's journey. The two scenes involving violence also work, which include Thatcher witnessing the assassination of a political mentor and surviving an IRA bombing with her husband, while staying a hotel for a political conference. The Falklands War is covered in the style of a standard biopic but we do learn interesting details as to Thatcher's reaction to the conflict (she writes personal letters to the families of each soldier killed). Finally, there's a powerful scene (albeit somewhat clich&eacute;d), as Thatcher witnesses her husband's death, as he disappears into white light.<br /><br />Despite Streep's bravura performance, one feels that she acts in isolation. Undoubtedly, Thatcher's rise was dependent on a myriad of relationships, which are only touched on briefly here. What's more, the film's scenarists avoid taking a stand on many of her controversial policies, preferring to retreat to the generic portrait of Alzheimer's victim.<br /><br />In the end, we find out it was Thatcher's obstinacy that led to her political downfall. She ended up alienating her very own conservative party members, who couldn't stand her lack of flexibility and harsh, demanding work habits.<br /><br />Somewhere, there's a story here but not in the confused recollections of a sad woman, plagued with dementia. The rich tapestry of British political life from 1979 to 1990 is glossed over as we're treated to The Iron Lady's career from the outside in, instead of the inside out.</p></body></html>

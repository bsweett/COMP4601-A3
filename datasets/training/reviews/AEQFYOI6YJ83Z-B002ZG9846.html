It chronicles the rise (if we want to call it that) of the titular hero, whose secret identity is almost a nonentity: Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), a nobody at his high school, pining after a girl who thinks he's gay.  When Dave dons his superhero costume (a green and yellow wetsuit) and starts kicking butt, he becomes an Internet sensation.  But other people take notice: Big Daddy (Nic Cage) and his daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz).  Most noticeably, there's crime kingpin Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), whose son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) just wants in on the family business, even if it means making a friend and subsequently betraying him.  All of these culminates in a bloody, brilliant show-down.<br /><br />At the heart of KICK-ASS (and there is a heart) is the notion that only social misfits and people unsatisfied with their lot in life would ever don a costume.  No one in this film is perfect; Dave is lost and looking for himself, and both Big Daddy and Hit Girl are sociopaths; they make D'Amico (who microwaves a guy alive) look tame.  But that's the genius of KICK-ASS: it never takes itself seriously, so you never get the idea that it's promoting (or condemning, for that matter) violence.  The film (and graphic novel) just IS: it's here for your entertainment, and make of it what you will.<br /><br />Matthew Vaughn's directing is solid, as is the script; but the film hinges entirely upon the performances, as most films of this kind do.  Graphic violence and dark humor will only get you so far--as evidenced by the fact that the film falls away in the middle, as the violence slowly overtakes the humor.  Thankfully, we have solid performances, mainly from the supporting cast; Johnson is fine, but he couldn't have carried this film alone.  We have Mark Strong as the villain, menacing and hilarious at the same time; Strong has a knack for sinking his teeth into this sort of role.  As D'Amico's son, Mintz-Plasse manages to break out of typecast; he's entirely believable in his role as (first) and ignored son, and then as the masked "hero" Red Mist.  But it's really the teaming of Cage and Moretz that will be remembered.  Cage is delightfully over-the-top, going from aw-shucks to Dark Knight and back again.  Moretz is a wonder; easily the most controversial part of the film (and that's saying a lot, considering the level of violence here), she spouts obscenities and slits throats with a grace that's rarely seen in these films (also in time with the requisite rock 'n roll soundtrack; Vaughn getting his Tarantino on).  It's Hit Girl this film will be most remembered for, but really, the whole cast deserves a round of applause.  Even with the stellar source material, even with a fine script and directing and choreography, this film could easily have tanked.  As is, it stands as a great entry into the superhero cannon, both parodying the genre and trying to explain some of its appeal.  It is dark, laugh-out-loud hilarious, and violent: everything you could want on a Friday night.</p></body></html>

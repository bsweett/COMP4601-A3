'The Journey' by Antonia Fraser is one of the best Marie Antoinette books I have ever read. When I heard who the director was for this film I was skeptical, but I finally had to buy the DVD. I like Kirsten Dunst.<br /><br />The film has some very small details and events that are historically accurate. Marie Antoinette did indeed have to strip down nude in order to cross over into France, Louis XV was indeed interested in her bosom, and Marie Antoinette did stand shivering as her clothing was passed from one lady in waiting to another.<br /><br />The French court and atmosphere was accurate on film, cold, haughty and uppity, and yes at times ridiculous. Du Barry was portrayed well as were Marie's close circle of friends. Louis XVI was played perfectly. In my personal opinion, I will believe to my dying day that Louis XVI was a homosexual. Seven years to consumate a marriage and the first king NEVER to have a mistress?? C'mon folks, it isn't hard to figure this out.<br /><br />The costumes are magnificent. Kirstin Dunst is breathtakingly beautiful, and the luxrious life she lead in her early stages of her reign are pretty accuratly portrayed. Some find this film boring, I will admit that those who do not appreciate what this woman went through or what her life was all about, would find it boring. However the stage had to be set for what was about to come.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that there is no mention of the infamous Diamond Necklace episode. That event is as significant to the French Revolution as the fall of the Bastille. Yet the final scene we see the royal family leaving Versaille never to return. The movie ends just as the adventure, drama, and heartache of Marie Antoinette's life begins.<br /><br />In my opinion this project cannot end here. It is a terrible waste to just leave it hanging here. What about the escape attempt in the Berlin? The September massacres? The Tower imprisonment? The war with Austria? The trial, and finally her long ride to the guillotine? If a part two were to be done correctly and with Kirsten returning to her role as the doomed Queen, Marie Antoinette part 2 could be as lavish, loved, and succesful as the movie Titanic.<br /><br />For what the movie was, it was very good. I can honestly say I was not disappointed neither as a Marie Antoinette fan or a student. I think Kirsten was superb. I think for the period of her life that this film covered, it was very good and accurate. Lavish and boredom was the theme of her life until the Revolution began. But again, this movie is only half the story. I would recommend to anyone whio saw this movie to read 'The Journey' or any other Marie Antoinette biography. What happened to that woman and her children is one of the greatest tradgedies in Western History.</p></body></html>

Problem is they are good films with a message but there's not a good enough film attached to it to really elevate it or it's just a good film whenever you put it on and whether you'd even put it on sometime in the near future or even remember it is another problem. While it does have very solid acting all around, it does have nagging problems in its script, rather unbelievable scenes and events and a rather inappropriate ending given its tone.<br /><br />Erica Bain is a radio host who walks the streets of New York City, recording its sounds and waxing poetic about the ever-changing atmosphere and the stories within it. Happily engaged to doctor David, her life completely hits bottom when, out walking their dog, they're brutally attacked leaving Erica out for three weeks while David dies from his injuries. Grieving and shaken, Erica can't seem to function much anymore and buys a gun to feel more secure but when she kills a robber who murdered the store clerk, Erica becomes a different person and fears who that is while giving in to it anyway.<br /><br />Detective Mercer is investigating the victims in Erica's wake where her actions speak of a vigilante who takes down the criminals cops don't have the manpower or time for. Mercer is not content at letting people take the matter into his own hands but with Erica becoming interested in the investigation, Mercer can grow ever more suspicious about Erica's involvement and their developing friendship.<br /><br />The film in the end has 2 messages: does it make it right to stop crime by righting the wrongs the wrong way and do we really understand who we are if not given the opportunity to find out. Like a lot of films, the premise and moral uncertainties end up being more interesting than the film that deals with them since the film, as impeccably made as it is, just falls into pitfalls it shouldn't. A cute radio host literally does not get anything resembling violence towards her the whole time she's lived in New York and one incident has her practically attacked on a weekly basis? Or the useless Mercer partner character? Or Erica's art gallery friend that is literally in 2 scenes? Or its tonally wrong ending which essentially shoots down any moral debates it was generating? It's things like this that drag the film down.<br /><br />That being said, at least the film has some great acting and Jodie Foster always manages to bring gravitas into a role even if it wasn't required in the first place (like, I don't know...Panic Room? Flightplan?) While she is given some bad B-movie dialogue during her Superwoman scenes, it's the struggle and humanity that seems to diminish is where her talent comes through. Also delivering solid work is Terrance Howard who helps flesh out a character that could've easily have been some speaking-wisdom-from-the-podium type role where he's just there to clarify that the world can indeed suck from time to time. Unneeded though is Nicky Katt who basically plays the wisecracking partner and is simply somebody Mercer can talk to in crime scenes without having to talk to himself (which to be honest, Howard could probably pull off).<br /><br />Awhile ago, I rented a movie for my mom which she quite liked when she first saw it. A recent trip to the video store, she came across the same movie and asked whether or not we saw it. Me having a good memory, I said yes and mom looked at me like "huh...weird I don't remember". That's kind of like the Brave One: you see it and it's good; let it sit for awhile and can't remember much from it.</p></body></html>

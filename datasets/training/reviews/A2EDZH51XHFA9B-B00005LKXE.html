Four-time Oscar nominee Julianne Moore, Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins, Oscar nominee Giancarlo Giannini, critical darling Gary Oldman (who should have already won at least two Oscars by now), and Golden Globe nominee Ray Liotta manage to embarrass themselves in front of the camera, while Oscar winner Ridley Scott and Oscar nominee David Mamet (of all people to adapt Harris' novel, why Mamet?) do the same in the rear. All of these people have proven themselves, in some cases many times over, as brilliant workers in film. I mean, Ridley Scott has directed both one of the finest horror films and one of the finest science fiction films of all time. Mamet's House of Games is one of the finest films ever made in any genre. The actors speak for themselves.<br /><br />I assume what they were all thinking is that Hannibal could be Silence of the Lambs II. The problem being that Ted Tally took Thomas Harris' almost aggressively mediocre novel and made something great out of it, and neither Tally nor Jonathan Demme was all too slavish about keeping things Harris-ized. Mamet and Scott, on the other hand, were slavish to Harris' even more aggressively mediocre novel in all the wrong places. Worse, they took the only part of the novel that really worked and destroyed it. I'd put off seeing Hannibal for four years because I expected it to be bad, but I certainly didn't expect the travesty that I actually got.<br /><br />There is, to be fair, some decent acting. All of it, every last bit, comes from Anthony Hopkins, who here still manages to keep Hannibal Lecter from being a complete self-parody (as he was in Red Dragon the year following). The rest of the cast can be written off. Had Hannibal been a one-man play, it would likely have been far more satisfying.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs. *</p></body></html>

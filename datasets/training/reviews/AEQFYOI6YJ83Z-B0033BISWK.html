<meta name="summary" content="Representative of what science fiction strives to be."></head><body><p>Lately, Hollywood has seen science fiction films as a way to show off: look at what we can do, look at how creative and imaginative we are.  DISTRICT 9, thankfully, follows in the tradition of what science fiction set out to be: thoughtful, deep, with resonance in our contemporary culture.<br /><br />The film follows a colony of roughly one million aliens (dubbed "prawns" due to their crustacean appearance) that have essentially crash-landed on earth.  Unable to go anywhere else, they have been restricted to District 9 in Johannesburg, a run-down shantytown typical of refugee camps.  After 20 years, the inhabitants of Johannesburg have become fed-up with their neighbors.  It is time for the prawns to be relocated.  However, in the midst of handing out eviction notices, Wikus Van De Merwe (an outstanding, Oscar-deserving Sharlto Copley) becomes infected with a prawn concoction, a substance that is slowly altering his DNA.  Wikus is suddenly forced to side with a people he has subjugated and ridiculed, and must fight to save not only his own humanity, but the existence of an entire species.<br /><br />It's true, DISTRICT 9 becomes bogged down near the end in special effects.  Still, the first two-thirds of the film are phenomenal, showcasing humanity's interaction with what we don't understand.  The effects alone are worth the price of admission; the effects are outstanding, with the aliens interacting flawlessly with the humans around them.  Yet it's the story, the emotional power behind it, that will help DISTRICT 9 stand the test of time.  This will go down as a science fiction classic, another in a long tradition of sci-fi films that dig deep beneath the human skin, that aim to shine a spotlight on our human foibles.</p></body></html>

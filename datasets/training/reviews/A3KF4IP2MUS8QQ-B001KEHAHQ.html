<meta name="summary" content="A very funny movie from start to finish"></head><body><p>It goes without saying that no one can ever take the place of Peter Sellers, who will always be the perfect embodiment of Inspector Clouseau, but Steve Martin - a legend in his own right - really takes this role and runs with it, leaving a steady train of laughter in his wake.  I thought the entire film was very funny - lots of slapstick stuff, of course, but also some more subtle humor that played well without becoming pretentious.  Martin's fake French accent was a definite winner, and - let's face it - a fake French accent is the funniest accent of them all (with the possible exception of the Swedish Chef from the Muppets, of course).<br /><br />If you're like me, you've probably wondered at one time or another just how the cartoon Pink Panther and the Pink Panther movies are connected.  Well, you're going to have to keep wondering because I'm still not sure myself.  Sorry about that.  Anyway, in this particular film (loosely based on the original movie in the series), the Pink Panther is an obscenely gigantic diamond that is stolen from the head coach of the French soccer team when he is murdered in the middle of a packed soccer stadium.  Inspector Clouseau is brought to Paris, made a detective, and given charge of the murder case - not because he is the right man for the job, but because Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) wants an incompetent boob to divert media attention while he goes about solving the case himself - thereby ensuring himself of his long-coveted Legion of Honor award (for which he has already been nominated seven times).<br /><br />Determined to finally prove his detective skills, Clouseau throws himself into the investigation, leaving no stone unturned.  Because justice is justice and France is France, he will not rest until the murderer is caught.  All kinds of hilarity ensue as he unleashes his unique good cop, bad cop interrogation technique on a witness, demands to question a murder victim, endeavors to lose his French accent for some undercover work in America, and generally goes around making a fool of himself without even realizing it.  It's a recipe for constant hilarity.<br /><br />Don't expect a lot from the story itself, as it's thrown together somewhat haphazardly; just sit back and revel in the comedic antics of Steve Martin.  He is at all times the center of attention, although I must say that the rest of the cast is quite good (although  I think Jean Reno's enormous talents are wasted for the most part as Clouseau's sidekick Ponton).  Beyonce Knowles acquits herself well in the role of the murder victim's girlfriend, and Kevin Kline seems to take great delight in his role as Chief Inspector Dreyfus.<br /><br />The bottom line is this: this new incarnation of The Pink Panther is an exceedingly funny movie, and Steve Martin proves himself to be the perfect choice to try and fill Peter Sellers' shoes for a new generation.  I'm not naturally a fan of remakes such as this, but I think even the most dedicated Peter Sellers fan can really enjoy the humor of this film.  It really is a funny movie from start to finish.</p></body></html>

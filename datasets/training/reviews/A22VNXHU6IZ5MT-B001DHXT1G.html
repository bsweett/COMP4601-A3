<meta name="summary" content="This IS The Incredible Hulk on Blu Ray!!! An awesome release!!!"></head><body><p>This is a great Blu Ray release!!! 2008's Incredible Hulk delivers in spades!!! It's been a good year for Marvel(This film,and Iron Man!) and DC too(The Dark Knight)!!! If you have a Blu Ray player than this is the version to get,these kind of films look freakin' awesome on the superior Blu Ray format,it also has a super cool 3D lenicular outer sleeve too,but this collectable packaging is for a limeted term only!!! Better than the 2003 version,which is also great!!! Very recommended!!! A+</p></body></html>

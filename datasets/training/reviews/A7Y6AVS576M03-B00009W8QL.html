At best this film could have been stretched into a taught half-hour TV show in the hands of a director like Alfred Hitchcock. However, those days are long gone. This is another example of a potentially good story premise poorly executed. The trailer says it all. Did I mention that Colin Farrell is thoroughly obnoxious and downright nauseating? Only Forest Whitaker and Kiefer Sutherland keep this from being a one star zero.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="New "Dawn" tries to teach an old genre new tricks"></head><body><p>Zach Snyder's remake of George Romero's 1978 cult classic is more of an update than a retread. Aside from its mall setting, a couple of cameo appearances from original cast members, and a few dialouge lifts, this movie is its own entity, which seems to ask why the makers would even release it as a remake? If "Resident Evil" wasn't a credited remake of "Day Of The Dead" then certainly this shouldn't be one of "Dawn". Though in Hollywood where it's much easier to market movies that are based off previously-existing films and TV shows, it's not that much of a surprise as to why the producers chose to go with the "Dawn" title. <p>I was one of the most skeptical of the idea of a "Dawn" remake scripted by "Scooby Doo" movie screenwriter James Gunn but the movie actually provides quite a bit of bang for your buck. The zombies in Snyder's "Dawn" are less the slow-moving creatures from the Romero world and more like the fast-paced infected terrors in Danny Boyle's "28 Days Later". While some Romero traditionalists might view this as "cinematic blasphamy", it does make the walking dead a far greater threat and adds a far greater deal of tension to the film. <p>Like the original, the new "Dawn" involves a group of people trying to survive a zombie plague who take refuge in a shopping center. Instead of only four characters, there are more than a dozen or so, the central being Sarah Polley's good-natured nurse and Ving Rhames' survivalist cop. Also thrown in the mix are a rag-tag trio of mall security guards, a drug dealer and his pregnant girlfriend, and a handful of other survivors. Snyder and Gunn never really explore the type of social commentary that many often associated with Romero's "Dead" films. The characters do argue and have their differences but it only becomes a problem in small portions. Where Romero showed society being ripped apart by its own inability to function in a crisis, Snyder chooses to go more for the "Assault On Precinct 13" approach. Mankind is being wiped out by the strength of its opposition, not by its lack of unity. <p>Zack Snyder's direction of "Dawn" is both hit and miss. The opening five minutes or so are a real poor start but the moment that Sarah Polley's Anna is thrown into the chaotic Wisconsin streets, we are bombared with amazing images of widespread terror. Similiar images involving amusing sight gags and fast-paced imagery prove rewarding but Snyder seems to also suffer from the "Michael Bay" snydrome of throwing in flashy shots for the sake of being flashy. One such case involves one of the film's only major human conflicts in which two characters are pitted against one another in a sort of stand-off. We're treated with all sorts of violent eye candy as blood spills, brain fragments erupt, and we're treated to close-up after close-up of empty shells hitting the floor. What should have been a powerful character moment is reduced to a loud gun battle with about as much emotion as a Super Bowl car ad. A concluding ode to the "Blair Witch Project" also smacks of a director more intruiged by cheap visual flare than good story-telling. Snyder is more or less the Michael Bay to Romero's John Woo. <p>James Gunn's script, while devoid of any of the real character interaction and social commentary that made Romero's "Dawn" such a powerful film, does have a good deal of fun with its content. Having the characters bounce golf-balls off their zombie counter-parts' heads and play a "shooting game" that involves celebrity look-a-likes adds a lot of humor to the film without down playing its intesity. If there is one thing that I can definetly say is done right with this new "Dawn", it's providing tense moments. As mentioned before, the zombies are not slow-moving so escaping from them is far more difficult. The humans aren't given the ability to play around with them like they were in other films. Aside from the quicker zombies, Gunn does his best to stay loyal to the Romero mytholigy though there are some instances where his attempts to create new shocks out of an old premise result in some awful ideas such as a predictable and thorougly cheesy "zombie baby" sequence. <p>"Dawn Of The Dead" is probably one of the better remakes to come out in awhile. While it isn't on the same level as say, John Carpenter's "The Thing", it does do an honorable job of making zombie movies both scary and fun again. It is far more of a stand-alone film than Savini's remake of Romero's "Night", which more or less played the same exact story with a different cast. It also outshines the handful of zombie films, such as Paul Anderson's "Resident Evil", which borrowed so heavily from Romero's "Dead" films. Only "28 Days Later" can really boast doing the job better. I think it would have worked fine on its own merits without using "Dawn" as its title but I'm sure that Richard Rubenstein is happy to get the check in the mail.</p></body></html>

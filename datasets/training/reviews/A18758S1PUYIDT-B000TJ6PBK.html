<meta name="summary" content="Looks cool, but has no point"></head><body><p>Very cool special effects and production design here, and John Cusack does his best.  However, it can be hard to translate King's work to the screen and this is an example of that problem.  Samuel Jackson is fine, but his role really could have been played by anyone.  I really couldn't see the point of the whole thing either.  The weak ending certainly does not help.  I'd wait until cheapo day at your local video rental place before getting this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great fun"></head><body><p>Fantastic four actually delivers what it promises- a film which is based on a comic book.  So if you put aside the negative reviews and watch it in a light and "popcorn" mood you will actually enjoy it.<br /><br />The film is about a team that goes into space to study a unique phenomenon which, in turn, alters their dna and they get special powers.  And the Fantastic Four are born.  Jessica Alba is gorgeous but Flame and Thing/Rock really spice the film up.<br /><br />The film is not really true to the comic book but it does not really matter as it is entertaining provided that you watch it in a relaxed mood.  There are some flows and the romance outcome is predictable but you will enjoy it.Moreover it sets it self up for more sequels and hopefully they will be as good.<br /><br />The blu-ray version is excellent and the special effects come out in a stunning form.  The picture is as sharp as it can be and makes the film even more enjoyable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, but a bit too silly to evoke the spirit of the comic book"></head><body><p>Ah, comic book movies always have a hard time of it.  How do you strike the balance of nostalgia for the older audience and still update the story enough to involve the young people.  Another aspect is deciding whether you want the film to feel to the older audience the way it felt to them as a kid (so you would have to step up the intensity of the story quite a bit) or do you recreate the story as it was (to put on film the stories we loved as kids).  Well, this movie tries to have it all ways and ends up a bit confusing.  It updates the story of how the Fantastic Four came to be and their emotional struggles, but keeps the struggle with Dr. Doom much like the way it was done decades ago; lots of flying around, banging around, but not much real threat or damage except to property.<br /><br />Still, I am glad to have seen the story and hope they do another, better, edition of this group.  Each of the actors is good for his or her role, including and especially Alicia (Kerry Washington) for Ben Grimm.  She can be developed and integrated into the story much more than she was in this film.<br /><br />BUT, please, stop with the comic book stupidities like the Human Torch risking igniting the atmosphere because he went to 4,000 degrees Kelvin (which is only 6,740 degrees Farenheit).  Nuclear reactions are magnitudes hotter and controllable.  Puh-leeze.  And calling that temperature Super Nova is dumber than dumb.  A Super Nova is an exploding star, not a temperature.  There are many more stupid statements in the film, which is something like the comic book, but can't we upgrade it a bit above the ridiculous?<br /><br />This makes for an ok entertainment, but nothing terribly memorable or moving.</p></body></html>

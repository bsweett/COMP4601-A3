<meta name="summary" content="SCREWBALL COMEDY FOR THE MILLENIUM"></head><body><p>The screwball comedy was a staple in theaters when movies first discovered sound. The antics of Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart and a ton of other actors made audiences laugh and weep and in general have a good time at the box office. This genre comes to life once more with the release of JUNO.<br /><br />Juno (Ellen Page) is a typical teen for the most part. As opposed to most films that center the attention around the cheerleader (face it, percentage wise how many teens are actually cheerleaders?), Juno is a normal student who has a strong attachment to her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). So much so that she seduces him and the two share their first intimate moment with one another. With, for them, unexpected results.<br /><br />Yes, Juno ends up pregnant. She lets her parents in on what has happened and the pair offers her support as opposed to verbal abuse. Visiting a local abortion clinic, she thinks twice and decides instead to have the baby. Their support helps her to locate a nice couple seeking to adopt in an upper middle class home.<br /><br />As Juno's pregnancy continues, she keeps in touch with the couple, letting them know what's going on. She also begins to bond with the husband (Jason Bateman) who she shares interests with in music and movies.  The wife (Jennifer Garner) just sees Juno as the mother carrying the child that she so desperately wants.<br /><br />As the film progresses, we are given a look at this young lady who is facing a crisis in a more level headed manner than we would expect, not only from those in real life but from film lives as well. Juno jokes about her pregnancy, sarcastically spills out about her less than supportive boyfriend and discusses life in general. She is one of the most well rounded characters seen on film in some time and it was a delight to glimpse this life.<br /><br />The film progresses to a point where we discover all is not well with the "perfect family" Juno has chosen for her child. It's a revelatory moment that affects not only the couple involved but Juno as well. It's a discovery that the world is a difficult place to find perfection in no matter how much you desire it.<br /><br />The ending of the film is fantastic. No quick solutions, no movie filled dream sequence where everything turns out the way a Hollywood writer would want it to be. No, this time we are offered a chance to see a real solution where there is a happy ending, just not the one you expected.<br /><br />This low budget gem arrived in theaters and was hailed by critics and fans alike and understandably so. It feels fresher than anything seen in months, perhaps years. The look of the film is great, the direction is top notch and the acting is some of the best seen lately. Low key when needed and abrupt at others, all of the actors involved deserve notices for a job well done.<br /><br />Outstanding from the rest is Page as Juno. Having made a name for herself in the revenge drama HARD CANDY, she shows a different side here in the smart mouthed, in over her head Juno. She carries off this character as if she were portraying herself rather than someone written. It is her performance that centers this film and makes it a gift.<br /><br />JUNO is not your typical pregnant teen flick. It's more than that. It's a glimpse of life as it is, life as it can be as opposed to the two options most Hollywood films offer of dysfunctional families of happy ever after marriages. The movie shows real life in a pleasant way, and isn't that what it's usually all about?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Million Dollar Baby  (2004)"></head><body><p>Director:  Clint Eastwood<br /><br />Cast:  Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, Jay Burachel, Mike Colter, Lucia Rijker.<br /><br />Running Time:  132 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for boxing violence, thematic material, and some language.<br /><br />Fresh off his success of the critically acclaimed "Mystic River", director Clint Eastwood embarked on "Million Dollar Baby", the "Rocky"-esque account of a near middle-aged, courageous individual who would give up anything just to follow the path in which she believes she needs to take.  What originally begins as a sports drama becomes much more:  a harrowing depiction of the despair that comes from the loss of a loved one, the tremendous valor of the soul that can be reached through the help, assistance, and dedication of others, and the ultimate sense of loyalty and care.  Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, an elder boxing coach, manager, and expert 'cut man' who runs a gym and is learning Gaelic on the side. He's a nice enough guy, but he can't seem to shake the guilt from ghosts in his past (he has lost contact with his only daughter). His guilt and ignominy is a constant just beneath the surface and gives him something of a cold exterior, sometimes frozen. Yet Dunn's aware of his own plight, but just doesn't know how to melt the ice or more importantly, if he's deserving of such a meltdown.<br /><br />Enter Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank in a wonderfully portrayed role), a thirty-something trailer trash woman from southwest Missouri. An unlikely hero for sure. Like many people, Maggie's dream (being a professional boxer) is always just out of reach, yet she cannot give it up. She works as a waitress to make ends meet (or at least the ends are almost touching), but spends all her spare time training. Like Dunn, Maggie has her own ghosts haunting her, and through these ghosts they bond tighter than super glue. The heart and work (incalculably huge amounts) that Swank put into becoming Maggie are unnoticeable. It's a silly phrase but it's as if she was born to play this part. It fits like a glove.  Morgan Freeman plays Scrape, Dunn's right-hand man at the gym, and reprises a role similar to Red from "The Shawshank Redemption". He also voices the omniscient narration to the story, a la Red. Like Dunn and Maggie, he's similarly bruised, but somehow less deeply. He's there when both of them need support and helps to bring them together.  Together, the three enter on a journey of courage, hard-work, and love, which eventually leads Maggie to the peak of accomplishment-a chance for fight for the woman's welterweight championship.<br /><br />Eastwood's performance in "Baby" is just the right anchor the film needs to keep it from sinking due to a heavy dramatic workload, and the clich&eacute;d material the script touches on from time to time. His gruff, weathered performance hits all the right notes, but also retains an unanticipated warmth that Eastwood rarely lets out. His co-stars are just as striking. Eastwood's "Unforgiven" partner Freeman is a treat in a supporting role (which he won an Oscar for).  The two enjoy easy chemistry and longstanding acting history and it shows winningly in every frame they share.  The elders are an excellent tease for "Baby," but it all hangs on Hilary Swank's performance in the title role. A chameleon performer, Swank inhabits Maggie both mentally and physically, breaking quite a sweat in both departments. Maggie isn't a lost soul, but her defiance in spirit and lack of guidance has led her into a dead end. Swank captures that lost but ultimately found emotional movement like a champ, and her pugilist skills seen in various boxing matches are just as believable. Swank isn't the seasoned acting pro like her co-stars, but her full court press in this difficult role is stunning, and her performance perfection because of her unwavering dedication to the character's flaws. Cinematographer Tom Stern crafts characters in shadow, shifting in and out of light. There is a grey area between the light and the dark where something approaching truth lays waiting, and this is where Eastwood takes us, and then leaves us there to ponder. "Million Dollar Baby" is a great American film, thrusting the audience into a realm of emotion and ambiance not often consummated on film. Even more accomplished than "Unforgiven" and "Mystic River", yet even more personal, this film is a triumph of human storytelling.</p></body></html>

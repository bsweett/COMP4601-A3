<meta name="summary" content="A great film with even better acting!"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood (Director/actor) takes his specialized filmmaking skills again to an Oscar level with Million Dollar Baby. Eastwood takes his years of acting, producing and directing experience to accomplish an emotional character driven award winning film.<br /><br />Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is lifetime, hard-nosed boxing trainer and manager. He started out in boxing as a cut man. He was in the corner of Eddie "Scrap-iron Dupris (Freeman) when he lost in the title match. Now, he just lost his best fighter to another trainer/agent because Frankie would not give the demands for a title shot. Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) asks Frankie to train her because he is the best. After some convincing Frankie agrees, but only if she follows his rules. A close father/daughter relationship is struck. Frankie's lack of relationship with his daughter will only bring out his fatherly traits. The ending explodes the heart like a emotional nuclear time bomb.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is a great film with even better acting. All deserve receiving awards for their outstanding acting work. Its is nice to see a film based on acting skills rather than special effects only to carry a film.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" received Academy awards for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor. This DVD will not disappoint any viewer. Sure you could pick apart or disagree with technical aspects of what YOU would do but Clint Eastwood shows why He received the Best Director Award from the Academy. (Scene: Frankie and Maggie driving home at night. Check out the lighting. Awesome! ) Eastwood also did the musical score for his film which only shows his brilliancy.<br /><br />This DVD is a must have for your collection</p></body></html>

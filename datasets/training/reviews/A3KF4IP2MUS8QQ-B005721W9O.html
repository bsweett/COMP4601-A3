<meta name="summary" content="By Grabthar's hammer, this is a funny movie"></head><body><p>I've never really been a fan of Tim Allen or Sigourney Weaver, so I put off watching this movie for a good while.  I kept hearing and reading about how funny it was, though, so I finally gave in and watched it.  The stories I heard are true because this is really an excellent comedy.  I myself have some natural tendencies toward the type of TV show fans being lampooned in jest here, but we geeks have an amazing quality of laughing at ourselves when what we are seeing is genuinely funny.  The idea is actually just short of brilliant; take the cast of a Star Trek-like science-fiction show cancelled twenty years ago and put them in a situation wherein they have to become the characters they played in order to save themselves and an entire civilization.  The script is excellent, introducing great characterizations of the characters early on, keeping the action and comedy coming fast and furious, and maintaining the comedy at a witty and fresh level.<p>Tim Allen plays Jason Nesmith who plays Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, an obviously Shatner-inspired character who continues to hog all of the spotlight garnered from the old Galaxy Quest series, not realizing that his fellow cast members hold him in some disdain for his egomaniacal antics.  A surprisingly blonde and very funny Sigourney Weaver plays Gwen DeMarcol who plays Lt. Tawny Madison, and she has always been unhappy about the fact her character on the show was never taken seriously.  Then there is Alan Rickman's character Alexander Dane who plays the reptilian-human Dr. Lazarus; this formerly successful British &quot;real actor&quot; despises his rubber-headed character and constantly laments the depths to which his previously distinguished career has sunk.  The other characters are also great: the fairly weird Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub) who plays Tech. Sgt. Chen, former boy actor Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) who plays Lt. Laredo, and even Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), better known as the expendable character whose lack of a last name makes him expect to meet death around every corner.  You absolutely have to love the odd alien Thermians who seek the help of Commander Taggart in a last ditch effort to save their people and culture from a ruthless menace, believing all of the Galaxy Quest shows they intercepted in space to be actual historical documents of the bravest ship's crew to travel the universe.  <p>The new adventures of the crew of the NSEA Protector, with the characters pretending to be the heroes they aren't, are rollicking good times interlaced with plenty of comedy and ruminations as to how our heroes ended up in this kind of unbelievable situation.  There are even a couple of poignant moments inserted into the story which complement the comedy quite well and provide further insight into characters who, quite impressively, never really become total parodies of themselves.  The special effects are also excellent, and that is another thing that Galaxy Quest has going for it.  In this type of comedy, the special effects would seem to be of secondary importance, so their impressiveness serves to keep the storyline from sinking into campiness.  Industrial Light and Magic handled all of the space scenes and some of the alien monsters, and the preeminent Stan Winston created some incredible aliens and monsters to fill this outrageous universe.  The DVD only makes a great movie even better, throwing in such extras as an enjoyably informative making-of featurette and a number of deleted scenes.  <p>You don't have to be a science-fiction fan to enjoy Galaxy Quest, although it will probably resonate more with those familiar with the Trek-like nature of the subject matter.  Underneath the laughs and thrills hides a decidedly human story that inspires as it entertains, and this kind of quality comedy should be easily recognized and enjoyed by just about everyone.  It would have been so easy to turn this kind of movie into something really silly if not insulting, but Galaxy Quest is nothing short of a brilliantly made comedy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A genre film with style and substance."></head><body><p>Going in I was expecting an Action film with two-dimensional characters and loads of gunfire caught on film with shaky camera shots to make them seem more violent than they already are.  Instead of adhering to conventional 'Action' film nonsense and one-liners, however, the makers of this film have created a story where the characters are either likeable or interesting to watch and the violence is both realistic and often incredibly brutal.  There are some cliche' plot twists that appear at the expected times, but to the credit of these storytellers they do not dwell on them as if the audience should somehow be wowed or shocked by the revelation(s).  Thus any predictability is overshadowed by quicksilver action sequences or character-driven moments that are equally intense.  This film has a strong cast of actors led by a very capable director and a fantastic production staff that give this film more style and substance than is typical of the genre.  The photography is excellent and elevates the look of this movie to a highly professional level, as do all the technical aspects such as stuntwork and gunfire during the many firefights.  The action is bloody, to put it mildly, with some gruesome kills that made even a seasoned Action film fan like myself cringe and wince.  What I especially love about this film and with very few other Action flicks is that all the characters either get hurt or mortally wounded at some point during the story.  No one escapes unscathed.  In most other Action movies it gets ridiculous to see characters running through a swarm of bullets and not getting hit; for that alone, "Assault on Precinct 13" should be raised above the average Action film fare and revered for its exceptional use of violence as a means to an end rather than as a flashy way in which to deceive an audience into forgiving a film for falling flat during the quieter moments.  Both Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburn lead the way with their star-power and the rest of the cast rally around them to help the viewers care about each and every one of them.  This film is a pleasant surprise and a solid addition to the Action film genre.  Thank you.</p></body></html>

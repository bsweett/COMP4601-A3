<meta name="summary" content="Good potential that goes unrealized"></head><body><p>Here's a movie from Oliver Stone that turns out to be very restrained, somewhat drawn out, and ultimately not that compelling.  There was so much more that could have been done here, but too much time was spent on W's daddy issues and his ballpark fantasies.  Also, there should have been some mention of W's bungling of the Katrina hurricane disaster.<br />That said, Josh Brolin got the inflections down just right, while Richard Dreyfuss virtually stole the show as Dick Cheney.  The flashbacks were not confusing, and the choices of songs were perfect.<br />A mixed bag.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Once bitten - you'll want even more"></head><body><p>For those of you (or should I say "us") who really got into Kate Beckinsale's azz-kicking gory days in Underworld, here's your chance for more of the same. Even though three years have passed in our time, Evolution takes up right where the first movie ended, but thanks to the magic of flashbacks we get some more background info on the blood feud and how it all began.<br /><br />Way, way back, Alexander Corvinus had two sons, Marcus (Tony Curran) and William. The first was bitten by a bat and became a Death Dealer with the fangs to prove it, and the second was bitten by a wolf to become the forefather and prototype for the Lycans who get all furry and howl at the sight of a full moon.  William however, was unable to control his blood lust, and made quite a nuisance of himself, until he was hunted down and locked away forever, much to Marcus's dismay and anger. Having been double crossed by Viktor (Bill Nighy), Marcus is out for revenge, and of course for blood.<br /><br />Back to present day, the war between Vampire and Lycan continues, and Marcus is awakened with some new tricks up his wings and a burning desire to set William free. Standing in his way is Selene, the hottest vampire action heroine in recent movie history (Beckinsale naturally) and her trusty sidekick Michael the hybrid (Scott Speedman).  Between them they unknowingly hold the key and the map to William's prison, and soon find themselves in Marcus's sights.<br /><br />In between the fighting and hiding from the sun and such activities, the two leading characters manage to squeeze in a little nookie time, which of course provides some eye-candy for us the viewers with its strategic placement between all the carnage.  The story line is a bit confusing if you haven't been making notes, and don't ever ask Selene her age, but as far as action, CGI and drama goes, this one is a non-stop thrill.  Recommended for vampire lovers and blood suckers everywhere.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 5, 2006</p></body></html>

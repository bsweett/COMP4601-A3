<meta name="summary" content="RIOTOUSLY FUNNY!!!"></head><body><p>DISCLAIMER: This review is based on my viewing it in the Movie Theater on Saturday, November 11, 2006.<br /><br />Okay, I did a preview before, about 6 months ago, but this is an EDIT of that preview, so the actual viewing of this movie happened on Saturday, November 11, 2006.  Therefore, the 7 of 34 helpful votes you see might be reflective of that prior review.  "Reviewers of reviewers" can be so cruel!<br /><br />I saw this movie with my brother in a packed theater!  I rarely see movies in the theater anymore.  I just don't see the point of paying $7 - $10 for the movie, than $15, three to six months later for the DVD?  What's the point!  But my brother generously invited me, and I have to say, I'm very glad I accepted his invitation!  This movie was absolutely hilarious!  I think it was 10 X funnier than any movie I've seen in the past 10 years.  I even joked with my bro, I told him, I think that was even funnier than "The Apple Dumpling Gang" it being one of those movies that we saw as a kid, and thought was so hilarious, but if we were to watch it as adults, would think it was pretty stupid!<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS:<br />But this movie, Borat, we saw as adults, and got to laugh as kids again.  Wow!  What a rush!  I think the whole "man on man" love thing, was possibly the most hilarious thing ever caught on film!  I think his obsession with Pamela Anderson was also very funny!  Question:  Did Pamela act, or was she surprised by his attack at the Virgin Records store?  My brother and I were discussing that for a while!<br /><br />If you want to laugh as kids, but over very adult material, than go see this one, or rent it!  But be warned:  the material is quite adult.  I'm surprised this was Rated R, and not NC 17.  It was pretty bad.  Trust me!  You won't be sorry<br /><br />MC White said:  I have a new favorite comedy!  Hilarious!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="powerful portrait of a mad ruler..."></head><body><p>Dr. Garrigan(James McAvoy) graduates from medical school and heads to Uganda to escape his overbearing father and fullfill his idealistic dreams of helping the poor. Through his eyes we see a nation in the grip of a military takeover under the powerful and mad despot Idi Amin. Forest Whitaker gives a stunning, mesmerizing performance. When Dr. Garrigan witnesses then helps Idi Amin after a car accident, Idi Amin is taken by the young doctor and offers him a job as his personal physician. Against his better judgement and against the advice of some more world weary Brits, Dr. Garrigan is taken in by the affable and personable dictator. Much like the nation is until the dark side of the man is revealed. In an incredible scene when he is first presented Forest Whitaker shows the persona, the danger and the monster of Idi Amin. You know this is road to danger but you can't help but follow the powerful story. Dr. Garrigan's naivety is sometimes unbelievable but this movie is wonderfully shot, told and written.</p></body></html>

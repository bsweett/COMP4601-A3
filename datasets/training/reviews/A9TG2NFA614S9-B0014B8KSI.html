<meta name="summary" content="Fast Pace, Razor Sharp Acting"></head><body><p>This flick is a very complicated, tense, intense, frenetic drama in which the fixer lawyer, a sleazy George Clooney, goes through the movie looking like a man who suffers from terminal constipation. He's always dressed in black, always on the go, trying to clean up messes made by others and himself (a failed expensive restaurant project).<br /> Film a huge office complex, a law firm, with hundreds of harried and stressed-out overpaid lawyers jumping through hoops, make Sydney Pollack the firm's lead partner, and move the camera through the offices with a dizzying pace. The movie proceeds at high speed, keeps you guessing so that you feel that portentous events are taking place.<br /> A giant conglomerate is a major client of the law firm. It has been killing people with a carcinogenic agent. The conglomerate's chief counsel, Tilda Swinton, will stop at nothing, including murder, to prevent the plaintiffs from winning their class action settlement case.<br /> The viewer has to put all of the pieces in the jigsaw puzzle together including the piece played by Tom Wilkinson who has  developed a case of the ethics and turns traitor to his law firm and its client conglomerate. He stopped taking his medicine, and he's gone round the bend, making him an honest man.<br /> Get ready for a bumpy ride. Yet, this is a brilliant movie with great acting, pointed and enlightening cinematography, and a hustle-bustle pace that keeps you absorbed. Clooney as Clayton often needs a closer shave, but his portrayal is razor-sharp.</p></body></html>

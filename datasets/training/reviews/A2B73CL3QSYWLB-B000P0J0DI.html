<meta name="summary" content="The Wild West  Was a Bad Place"></head><body><p>In the twilight of Clint Eastwood's career an epiphany came to him.  The western types that he played in most of his films were essentially bad people.  This film is something of an atonement for those films.  His character, William Munney, after a life as a killer, is amidst his new life following the death of his sainted wife as an unsuccessful farmer.  Word comes to him that in a nearby town that a prostitute was mutilated by a some cowhands and a reward is being offered by her co-workers for the murder of the cowpokes.  Munney rationalizes taking up this offer by thinking that these boys are vicious and deserve to die and that doing so would not make him a bad man.  Before Munney can collect his reward, though, he has to get through the peace-loving sheriff, Little Bill, who will make sure nobody collects on the reward no matter how many beatings he has to administer.  The cynic could say that Eastwood made his bread and butter off violent western types and this is an attempt to cater to politically correct types.  I give Eastwood the benefit of the doubt here because this may be the best performance of his career and this film is so well crafted.  Gene Hackman is more than his equal as the sadistic sheriff.  The beauty of the western is that it is always being re-evaluated and this film stands at the top of the list of great westerns.</p></body></html>

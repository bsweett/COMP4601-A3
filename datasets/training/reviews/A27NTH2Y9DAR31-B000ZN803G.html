McCandless was able to form quick friendships which were more deep and sincere on the parts of the other people, his were rather more superficial at that point in time. He was filled with the angst and implacable censoriousness of youth and none of the appreciation for the fallibility of people, e.g., his own parents. Ostensibly it was the revelation that his father had continued relations with his first wife while married to his second and this sin, in McCandless's eyes, colored his entire life including his education, a career and any and all "things" that were in any way reminiscent of his parents. He nursed a cold rage against his father especially and used this revelation to justify his extreme callousness and carelessness toward his entire family including the sister he was so fond of and the abandoment of his car, a vehicle he supposedly treasured. He planned to inflict the ultimate hurt against his family by plotting his own disappearance and was so focused on this goal he lost sight of right and wrong and only considered his own wants which doomed him to die of starvation alone in the wilderness.<br />His arrogant, brash nickname "Alexander Supertramp" was another symptom of his hubris which ultimately seared his family with sorrow and drove him to a cold and lonely death in the old bus with no one around to comfort him in his last moments. He had fun playing the adventurer, for a while, then when he faced the reality of the situation he placed himself in, the fun and adventure vanished and he was left only with his very bad decisions. He went into a cold, forbidding environment virtually unprepared and without any supplies to speak of; tiny changes to his venture would have ensured his survival but it was not to be. Something as simple as slicing thin strips of the moose he killed and air drying them as opposed to smoking the meat and ending up with a maggot filled mess. Carrying beef jerky and dried fruit with him would have helped, pretty much any common care would have resulted in life instead of death and I do not believe for one second he intended or wanted to die. But he chose to ignore wise advice from people who had successfully gone into the wilderness and tried to give him the benefit of their own experiences...he even refused one man who offered to take him to buy adequate supplies. McCandless refused. It is a waste, it is not romantic at all, it is a tragedy and all the young men and women who find this event adventurous and exciting and worship McCandless and deify him are all sadly mistaken. The film was excellent and the music and actors all superb, but ultimately it describes a vengeful, angry, selfish, self centered young man who harbored a horrible grudge against his family and never even discussed this with them, but chose to plot to wreak revenge on them instead, which he did succeed at, his only success in this doomed adventure.</p></body></html>

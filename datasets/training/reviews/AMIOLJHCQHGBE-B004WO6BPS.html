<meta name="summary" content="What a great series, and an excellent ending"></head><body><p>To those who boohooed the Blu-ray/ultraviolet set, GET OVER IT! Okay, the UV was crap, but post on the movie! Not the lack of extras.<br /><br />SPOILER!!!! SPOILER!!!SPOILER!!! If you do NOT know what happens, PLEASE STOP NOW!!!!!<br /><br />Everything you thought about Snape? Well, you were wrong (personally, I saw that coming). Dumbledor was more of a finagler that you EVER thought, even in death. The bad guys get there's BIG TIME. Harry has kids who go to Hogwarts 19 years after the end of the film.<br /><br />Okay, now to MY review. I know almost everyone knows what happens in this dvd by now. I am 58, and a huge fan of this series. Deathly Hallows 1 was a very very dark set-up to finish with DH 2. The CG effects in DH2 are way better than any of the other films. There is not ONE moment that doesn't have you on the edge of your seat/couch. The filming is dark when it needs to be, and bright when it should be. The characters are no longer young kids, they have arrived into adults, and play that role. The soundtrack...excellent. Subdued and used purely to accent the action. While the plot takes you to the inevitable end, you find yourself embracing it, and, even though it is the end of this fantastic series, accepting. You will bury your face in your hands at the sad parts (yes, I may have shed a few tears), but shout cheers at you tv for the victories. And after all, isn't that WHY we watch this series? My ONLY sorrow, is there isn't more. The world created in this series is a very special world. And I will miss it.<br /><br />As to the DVD set, there are NO extras. At all. At least on my rental from Redbox.</p></body></html>

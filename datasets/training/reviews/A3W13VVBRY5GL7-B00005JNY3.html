<meta name="summary" content="Tries way too hard, and ultimately disappoints."></head><body><p>"The Skeleton Key" starts off very, very promisingly: Kate Hudson, Geena Rowlands and Peter Sarsgaard are very fine actors, and director Iain Softley has proven himself with several behind-the-camera successes such as 'Hackers' and 'The Wings of the Dove'. It's got a compelling premise, a fine pedigree and next-to-no competition in the Haunted House Movie genre.<br /><br />What a shame, then, that after a very strong opening forty-five minutes, the movie wimps out and delivers a climax and resolution that could just as easily have belonged to any other substandard horror movie.<br /><br />Caroline Ellis (Hudson) is a jaded hospice nurse with a new job, caring for stroke victim Ben Deveraux (John Hurt, badly underused here) in his own home. She meets and befriends his wife Violet (Rowlands) and their attorney Luke (Saarsgard), and begins to learn something of the Hoodoo superstitions surrounding the house, as things start to go bump in the night.<br /><br />'The Skeleton Key' is beautiful to look at, for the most part - the rainy, washed-out colours of the Bayou remind you very much of horror masters like Hideo Nakata and David Lynch, and as the director, Softley creates a hugely atmospheric visual style with the claustrophobic and flashback elements of the screenplay. Hudson and Rowlands do very credible jobs in their respective roles as jaded young woman and superstitious wife, and the script, like the setting, is languid and slow, but never lacking in eventfulness. 'The Skeleton Key' starts great.<br /><br />And then, sadly, it all goes badly wrong. Without giving anything away, let me just explain that, had Violet never really explained the story of the house to Caroline, and just let events speak for themselves, we might have had some creepy ambiguity spun out of the atmospheric visuals and ambivalent script to create the fear for us. Instead, as with pretty much all the Hollywood horror movies of late, the script decides that no, the audience really must be stupid, so let's spell everything right out for them, just so's there's no confusion.<br /><br />And in a movie that propses to create fear and tension out of the hazy shades-of-grey between superstition and belief, this is a fatal mistake. The latter part of the movie, because it explains everything, pretty much holds up signs to the audience that read "Plot Twist Coming Soon!". It's disappointing, and made all the worse because of an essentially powerful beginning. Flashback scenes are showy and ring false, and the penultimate scenes could be seen coming from a million miles away.<br /><br />All in all, 'The Skeleton Key' isn't really worth owning, and should be thrown over at the video library if you see anything else you think you might like. Southern Gothic it is not, neither is it scary. A big disappointment, this one really could have been so much better.<br /><br />Avoid!</p></body></html>

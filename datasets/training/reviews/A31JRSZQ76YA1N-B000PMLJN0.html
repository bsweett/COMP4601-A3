It smacks slightly back to the good old days of "what you see, what you don't see", and it's a pity that the alternate opening and ending was not selected and that a character was 'slashed' from the original release [the grim doll faced gate keeper]...... anyhoo, IF you like adult twisted fairy tales this one's for you.<br /><br />Smatterings of "Silent Hill" and "Ghost Story" - very chilly with a fading grate fire, rain pouring down outside, and creepy old houses - throw in a moulting black raven or two .....a real tongue twisted sister.</p></body></html>

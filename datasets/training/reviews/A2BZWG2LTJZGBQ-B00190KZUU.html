<meta name="summary" content="A modern day Walter Mitty"></head><body><p>Tim Burton's "Big Fish" is one of the more interesting movie going experiences I have had in some time.  The movie is well casted and acted, with the pacing and direction perfect.  Don't look for a complex storyline or big plot twist, because this movie really does not have much of a plot.  What it does have is a lot of heart, and characters you will enjoy spending 2 hours with.<p>Edward Bloom(Albert Finney) is dying.  As his son Will(Billy Crudup)comes to visit, Edward recalls lots of stories from his youth, about how he met his wife, his son's birth, different experiences he had, jobs he held, and so on.  Edward as a young man is played by Ewan McGregor.  His son has heard it all before and is upset because it is all make believe.  He hates that his father continues to fabricate these lies.<p>But the stories are magical and captivating.  Will's wife soon falls under the spell as she hears the stories Will has endured his whole life.  Every fisherman can tell a story about the "big one" that got away, hence the title of the movie.  The end of the film is not so much a development of the plot as it is a confirmation of it.  We suspected what we see, and we are happy with it.  James Thurber would have been proud.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Good Action Movie"></head><body><p>This was a fine action movie.  The fight scenes were very good although at times you could tell that the film speed was advanced in order to make it look faster.  It was also a theme that has been explored before (with Jackie Chan's 'Who Am I') with some success.  With all that aside it was still an enjoyable movie.  A movie about assassins and the CIA.  About someone's personal struggle between good and evil and about a fledgling romance and wanting to be a better person.  It was also about betrayal.  This is a decent way to spend a few hours.  Watch it and enjoy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Denzel shines in this cop thriller"></head><body><p>Earning Denzel Washington an Oscar for his bad guy persona, Training Day is an engaging film examining the events of one day in the life of a crooked cop and his innocent prot&eacute;g&eacute;.<p>At the center of the film are the on-the-spot performances of Washington and Ethan Hawke. Clearly the change in role for Denzel energized him profoundly in bringing his bad cop character to life. Though not as celebrated, Hawke is also excellent, portraying an eager Narc in training. These two grab you right in and hold you for the duration of the film.<p>The powerful story, though, is just as absorbing. Without spoiling too much, the corruption that Hawke's character witnesses through the course of the day is shocking and lands him into a situation he may not get out of alive.<p>Though the film at times falls back on some standard movie devices, overall it's fully entertaining and hard to stop watching. It's definitely a character movie to see more then once.</p></body></html>

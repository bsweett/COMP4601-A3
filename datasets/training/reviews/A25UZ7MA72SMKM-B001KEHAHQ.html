<meta name="summary" content="Below average for a Steve Martin film"></head><body><p>Steve Martin has done so well in his original roles, I have to wonder why he felt the need to "cover" the Peter Sellers performances of Inspector Jacques Clouseau. There is no question that there is always a risk associated with following up on the performance of an iconic character and series of movies. I haven't kept up with Martin's box office, but perhaps his numbers were slipping and he felt taking this chance was justified in the hopes he would hit a home run. After all, many of Martin's roles bear a great similarity to many of Sellers' roles, so there is a foundation upon which to justify this attempt.<br /><br />I want to preface the remainder of the review by noting that I've been a Steve Martin fan for decades now. Martin was a comedy writer for the Smothers Brothers show all the way back in the late sixties, although he came to national prominence more in his own right ten years later on Saturday Night Live. He went from there to sold out "comedy concerts", and of course a string of movie hits that are always amusing, and more often than not brilliantly funny ("The Jerk", "Roxanne", "All of Me", and more). So I'm predisposed to like anything he appears in. I found this movie a bit bland, despite the HUGE benefit of the doubt Martin is going to get from a long time fan like me.<br /><br />In the original Pink Panthers movies (at least after the first, in which Clouseau was a supporting character that took off), the mystery to be solved is not really the most important element of the story, as would be the case with most mysteries. The mystery is just a framework upon which to hang a continuing series of scenes in which Peter Sellers cracks you up, again and again. This movie shares that philosophy. In the long run, you'll probably have trouble remembering much about the plot, as the movie banks on the ability of Steve Martin to keep you laughing. It works in spots, but in others the pacing just doesn't seem correct. Sellers could take on a scene with a slow boil to a laugh and keep pulling you in. In similar style scenes in this movie, it just looks like comedy in slow motion, and those scenes are a little painful to watch. Some reviewers have said that they don't think Martin was trying to recreate the Sellers' performances. I'm not sure I agree with that. The jokes and slapstick were clearly meant to follow up on the Sellers' films. If Martin was not trying to mimic Sellers, at least the character was written in a very similar style, forcing him to look like he might have been mimicking Sellers.<br /><br />All is not lost, as there are some very funny bits in this film, they are just fewer and farther between than I was hoping they would be. The much promo'd scene where Clouseau is trying to drop his French accent, and the overuse of the word "'ambuger" is indeed a pretty funny sequence, to my mind. There are indeed other slapstick and situational sequences that are funny. However, it is not as funny as Sellers' Clouseau when Sellers was in "the zone".<br /><br />I recommend this as a Netflix queue selection, or catching it on TV, rather than a purchase. I think only a minority of viewers will want to watch this again and again. There are Steve Martin movies I've watched a dozen or more times, but I have a hard time working up enthusiasm to see this one even a second time. And why should I, when I can fire up "Roxanne" and watch him do the 20 very amusing nose jokes (actually about 23, if I remember my count LOL).</p></body></html>

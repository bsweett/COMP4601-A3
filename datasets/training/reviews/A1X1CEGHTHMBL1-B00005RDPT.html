Danny Ocean (George Clooney) has been just paroled and he has a plan, but he needs a crew, to pull off one of the biggest heists ever done.  He plans to steal $150 million from the high security vault that holds the money for three of Las Vegas' largest casinos.  His key partner is Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) and they meet up with a former casino owner Rueben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) to bounce the plan off of him and get him to help finance it.  They recruit eight specialists to pull off the heist and they are all the best in what they do.  They are con men, mechanics, explosives expert, acrobat, an electronics expert and a pick pocket.  They all know each other and they begin the planning stage of the robbery.<br /><br />They are all in it for the money but Danny Ocean has revenge on his mind.  His beautiful ex-wife Tess (Julia Robert) is the casino owner, Terry Benedict's (Andy Garcia) girlfriend.  Rueben also has no love loss for the Benedict and anything that hurts him would make Rueben happy.....<br /><br />This is a funny and high action movie with top notch stars that just make the story better.  With all of the great acting personalities in the movie the interaction is just interesting to watch.  This cast doing this movie was just put together for pure entertainment and it works perfectly.  The entire movie is entertaining and a lot of fun.  I recommend it to you as a good movie.</p></body></html>

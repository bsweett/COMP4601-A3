<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable western and that's pretty much it"></head><body><p>To be honest, western "classics" such as Once Upon a Time in the West or the Good, the Bad and the Ugly always seemed too long for me. I'm all for pacing and character development but only when it seems necessary and if you can get away with it otherwise. But an epic film doesn't have to be super long, no matter how well-made it is (sole exception is Seven Samurai, 3 and 1/2 hours is nothing). Tombstone is one of those kind of westerns people mention almost because they run out of recent westerns to name. Yeah, Unforgiven was great but then it's like "now what"? Director's cut usually implies the movie the director wanted us to see in the first place so watching Tombstone my first thought was yeah it's a good movie but what's so different this time?<br /><br />Legendary westerner Wyatt Earp is retiring along with his 2 brothers, Virgil and Morgan and they settle in the town of Tombstone. Also there is Doc Holliday, Wyatt's friend and stricken with tuberculosis. Wyatt has no intention of becoming town sheriff but might have to since "the Cowboys", a band of red sash-wearing bandits are causing trouble. Wyatt decides enough is enough and basically tears the West apart bringing down the Cowboys.<br /><br />I have to say this is one impressive cast. In addition to the main 4 leads: Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer(who's exceptional as Holliday), Sam Elliot and Bill Paxton (kind of miscast though), we have Powers Boothe, Dana Delany, Jason Priestley, Billy Zane, Charlton Heston even as well as Billy Bob Thornton and James Cameron regular Michael Biehn. Big cast don't necessarily mean good performances all around except Russell and Kilmer though everyone does have a share. Wasted though are Billy Zane and Jason Priestley who don't really add much or even do much. It's got a bit too much of a more "modern" feel rather than truly feeling like a western.<br /><br />Is there enough to like about this film? Definately, there's plenty of shootouts and gun battles, I already mentioned Kilmer but he's just so good from mannerisms to lines, even that weird coin thing he does in his introduction. There's a couple noteworthy scenes and the whole thing has a very accessible quality to it, rather than being too long for its own good. In fact, it almost seems like a good stepping stone into other westerns such as the Leone ones, Unforgiven or the way-back-then ones with John Wayne and whatnot. It's probably not the most deepest or best western you'll see but it's enjoyable when you get down to it.<br /><br />If all you're looking for is a good western then Tombstone isn't as bad a choice as you would think. Is it those treasured westerns? Probably not but it's worth a look.</p></body></html>

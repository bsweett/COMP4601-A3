<meta name="summary" content="Fun, good cast"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this but after reading some of the reviews I think I'd better check out the original John Waters film---I might like that better.  Having not seen that nor the stage version I had nothing to compare this with so I just took it as it came, and I liked it.  The cast was surprisingly good.  Christopher Walken is always very watchable; here is he cast as a relatively weak man and that's sometimes hard to do and still have it be interesting.  His dance duet with Travolta as Edna on the back porch is really lovely.  I kept thinking how much fun they must have had.<br /><br />Much has been said, pro and con about Travolta.  Since I didn't see Divine or the guy who did such a good job on stage, I can't compare.  I really liked him and thought his decision to play Edna "straight" was a wise one...I found myself thinking that this was a real person, Edna, not a guy playing a woman.  It probably would be a lot easier to go for camp but I liked what he did with it...made the character genuinely sympathetic.  He was also very funny and I tended to watch him no matter who else was in the scene.  OK, his accent wasn't perfect but he was the only one who at least attempted a Baltimore accent and at times he got it.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer was beautiful in a thankless role as the stereotyped up-tight White ex-Beauty queen. Queen Latifah was also beautiful as the steotyped warm hearted Black woman. Allison Janney plays another steotype--the cruel White Bible thumper.  (egad...all these stereotypes!!)  I might be the only person on the planet who got a little tired of Nikki Blonsky's one-dimensional role and I was at least glad she didn't win the Miss Hairspray contest.  Another stereotype---the fat girl with the heart of gold who wins the cute guy...not very realistic and why didn't she fall for a nice nerdy guy?  No, she wanted the cutie...so is she superficial or what?  Well....if you don't get too caught up in all the Messages that the film is trying to force at you, and just enjoy the energy and dancing, this is not a bad way to spend two hours.  (I wanted to correct my rating to three stars but couldn't figure out how to do it.)</p></body></html>

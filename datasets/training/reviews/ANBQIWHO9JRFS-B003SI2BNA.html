Make no mistake, it's definitely another modern ghost movie, but it takes a more character driven and more purely dramatic approach, so much so that up until the very latest portions of the film the supernatural aspects are almost a subplot.  The film is actually primarily character driven, focusing on the central Dahlia character and her daughter most of all, but still leaving plenty of room for the various minor characters.  Honestly, from a purely practical standpoint, we don't need to know these people as well as we come to, but this, along with the slow plotting of the film, helps generate a greater sense of reality and an overall expansiveness. I don't think this formula would work if it were repeated, horror films simply need to be more horrific then this as a whole, but for a lone attempt it's a fairly different, quite effective experience.<br /><br />'Dark Water' is a remake of a Hideo Nakata film from 2002. This strikes me as a peculiar film to rework, as it is a fairly effective but ultimately unremarkable film.  Also, the original 'Dark Water' has cash-in written all over it:  It's a 'Ringu' rehash directed by the maker of said film, based on a short story by Koji Suzuki, who wrote the original novel on which 'Ringu' is based.  Of course, the remake has got cash-in written all over it too, as well as the mark of the various `Ring' films: Roughly 1/3 of the plot of this film is simply recycled from `Ring/Ringu' while the American `Ring Two' (also directed by Nakata) lifted about a third of `Dark Water's plot.  (And, perhaps more significantly they have most of the same themes and motifs i.e. Girl-ghosts, water, motherhood etc.)  Still, `Dark Water' manages to seem far less reiterative simply by reworking the focus, downplaying the supernatural and emphasizing the human.<br /><br /> The film opens with a meeting between Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) and her soon to be ex husband Kyle (Dougray Scott).  It's hard to think of any divorce being to pleasant, but things are obviously bound to get prett tough here.  This separation means that Dahlia needs to find a new home, and shortly after this meeting she and her 6 year old daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade) move into a nasty, ultra-bland and rundown apartment complex on Roosevelt Island.  (My brother said this place reminded him of the Soviet built apartments he'd seen in Russia and you can totally imagine that; it's designed to be purely functional and not aesthetically pleasing, though it frankly is something of a failure in the former respect as well.)  This place has got a load of problems, the most disturbing one being the dark, viscous looking water leaking from the ceiling, and strange sound emanate from the supposedly empty apartment above.<br /><br />The film essentially follows the day to day life of Dahlia and Ceci, as things get increasingly weird and difficult:  Ceci soon acquires an imaginary friend whom she vehemently insists is real; Dahlia, who  has an ill-defined history of mental illness, begins to have disturbing dreams and to hear distant voices;  the divorce grows increasingly hostile and Dahlia suspects Kyle is trying to maker her look paranoid, all while the apartment continues to fall apart around them.  This all eventually comes to a head, but not until the final half hour, and I'm sure plenty of people will  lose patience with it.  It kept me interested, though, through the fine performances and stylish direction.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly is the center of the film, and she does a fine job.  Salles wisely refuses to turn her into a saint, allowing her to be fairly flawed and human, and ultimately more sympathetic.  Ariel Gade is your typical cute Hollywood kid, but what can I say, she's legitimately cute and the bonding scenes between her and Connelly seem very real.  There are also three fine supporting roles from Pete Postelthwaite, John C. Reilly and Tim Roth.  Reilly is the best of them as the total sleaze ball owner of the complex.  He spends the whole film endlessly praising the wretched apartments and dodging Dahlia's complaints.  I couldn't help but like him a little; sure he's slime, but it's his job and he's good at it.  Pete Postelthwaite plays his standard role, the funny-looking foreigner.  He's Veeck, the apartment caretaker something, and Postelthwaite makes him a more interesting character than he has any right to be.  Tim Roth is perhaps the most inexplicable of all of them as Dahlia's lawyer Jeff Platzer.  He takes an odd personal interest in Dahlia's life, yet lies to her constantly for no apparent reason.  One can't help but suspect that he has a romantic in her (I mean who wouldn't, ehh [nudgenudge].... even if she is crazy, so what....) but this doesn't go anywhere.  Anyway, this film is a real testament to how committed acting can bring life and significance to minor roles.<br /><br />This is an extraordinarily depressing looking film, filled with perpetual rain and a color palette extending from dirty brown to rust red.  Roosevelt island is just such a great locale as it is a total industrial wasteland.  It's a block from `Eraserhead' somehow made real.  The film is shot fairly elegantly, though the camerawork and staging are generally fairly unobtrusive.  One major exception to this rule are the dream sequences, which have a bit of flair and choppy editing, alongside some neat effects, like melting walls and whatnot.  Again, the ghostly stuff is fairly by the book, but it's sharply executed.  The climax is somewhat underwhelming but perhaps this is appropriate considering the low-key flavor of the film.  The denouemont is too heavy handed, but it's not that big of deal.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a fairly interesting, well-executed movie.  It's not liable to blow you away, but it's interesting and immersive.  Definitely worth a look if you're into this kinda thing.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></body></html>

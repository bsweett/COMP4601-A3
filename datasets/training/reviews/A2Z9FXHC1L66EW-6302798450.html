For those of you looking for a superb quality version of Army Of Darkness on DVD, buy the Universal Pictures version.  It only  includes Bios of Bruce Campbell, Embeth Davidtz, Sam Raimi, Production  Notes, and the Theatrical Trailer as bonus material, but the sound and  picture quality of the film are 100 times better than the horrible Anchor  Bay version (either the director's cut or theatrical). Take it from someone  who owns every version available, the Universal DVD is the one you want if  good quality is your thing (I know it's mine).  The only good thing on the  Anchor Bay version are the extras: audio commentary (on director's cut  version which has added scenes that look even worse than the regular film  transfer.  That's right, even the normal parts look bad on this DVD  compared to Universal), a short making of featurette (on the Anchor Bay  theatrical DVD) hosted by Bruce Campbell, and a film/storyboard feature on  the Director's Cut that's interesting.  People upset that the trailer isn't  on the Director's Cut should know that's because when it was a 2 Disc Set  the trailer was put on the Theatrical Disc (which is still available as a  single now).  When I heard a special edition of Army Of Darkness was coming  out I assumed it would be released by Universal Pictures.  Their  Collector's Edition DVD's are very impressive.  I'll even tell you that  when I bought the Anchor Bay version I took it back because I thought it  was defective (it appeared as if their were blemishes on the disc, in fact  every copy I've seen had these blemishes on them) only to find out that  they were all like that.  Anyone defending Anchor Bay should know that  Elite Entertainment released the Special Edition of the first Evil Dead  movie and it looks great.  So if the first film can look that good there's  no excuse why 'Army couldn't recieve the same wonderful treatment,  regardless that it's a bigger movie with more locations, which means more  work creating a decent transfer.  Let me add that Evil Dead 2 is being  rereleased by Anchor Bay as a Special Edition, so lets just hope and pray  they do a better job with Part 2 than they did with Part 3.  Oh, and  Universal, if you're listening, I'm sure I speak for every Army Of Darkness  fan when I say we'd love if you'd release your own Collector's Edition DVD  of this great movie and show the little guy (Anchor Bay) how real Special  Edition's are made.  (&quot;Give Me Some Sugar Baby!&quot;)  5 Stars  for The Universal Pictures DVD  1 Star for The Anchor Bay Versions  (because of the extras)</p></body></html>

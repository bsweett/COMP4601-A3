Sound like a government we know?<br />  It's facist Britain in 2020. The United States has fallen into civil war & no longer matters.<br />This seems to raise faintly disguised satisfaction in Britain. There is a terroist in London. He on the side of the people aiming to overthrow the oppressive government. For purpose of this movie, he is the good guy. He is pretty brutal & kills without hesitation, those that he deems, deserve it. He is inspired by Guy Fawkes. He plans to blow up Parliament on September 5. On that day  in 1605, Fawkes was to blow up Parliament. Fawkes was caught, tortured & hung. V wears a mask throughut. Natalie Portman is Evey & she's never been better. V saves her life & shortly she is involved in his activities. Both her parents had been murdered by this government & she has little use for it in any case. He does test her in a way that is cruel but ultimately helps her know her limits. They love each other but it is chaste & borne out of mutual admiration. I really like the whole feel of this movie. It did not feel like a futuristic fantasy. The old newsreels & faux news report made it seem very real. One the best movies in the last several years & highly recommended.</p></body></html>

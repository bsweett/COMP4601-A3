<meta name="summary" content="Big green disaster..."></head><body><p>The Hulk, as a character, seems really intriguing.  I'll admit, I never read his comic series despite being obsessed with Marvel as a whole, and so I didn't know much about him other than the random times he popped up in Spider-Man or whatever.  I saw bits and pieces of Ang Lee's 2003 disaster of sorts while on vacation a few years back and fell asleep.  Visually, it seemed tight but organically it lacked depth.<br /><br />This 2008 abomination is just lacking everywhere.<br /><br />The visuals are cheesy and so cartoon like that it made me literally depressed.  I mean, we can't expect all of our superhero films to have the depth of character that Nolan or even Rami brought to their respective franchises, but we should expect that they are visually impressive.  `The Incredible Hulk' is just blandly created and looks so garish.  The Hulk himself looks awful, but the real sinker visually was that thing that comes of Tim Roth.  Seriously, that was a mess.  Other than the ridiculous use of CGI, the storyline is messy and the acting is terrible.  Edward Norton, who is usually VERY good, is wooden and merely a prop that leads to bigger and dumber things.  Liv Tyler first of all looks awful and her hushed voice is used desperately here.  She sounds like an idiot, and her performance lacks all conviction.  The makeup job on Hurt was great (almost unrecognizable) but the makeup on Roth was terrible, and his performance was atrocious.<br /><br />All around, this is a comic failure (pun intended).</p></body></html>

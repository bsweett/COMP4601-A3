<meta name="summary" content="Dynamic, Risk-Taking Film-Making that Pays Off"></head><body><p>Two years ago, we were all re-introduced to Spiderman, the Superhero with everyday problems that cramp his style as a day-saver.  In the opening munites of "Spiderman 2," the thrilling and deeper sequel to the wide-eyed original, Perter Parker (Tobey Maguire) loses his job, ruins his laundry, gets behind on his rent and finds he is still living in a low-rent apartment with a nosy tenant.  Life sucks, even for a revered Superhero.  All Peter Parker wants to do is finish his college work, meet with one of his idols Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina) and especially enter into a meaningful engagement with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and keep a devastating secret from his best friend, harry Osbourne (James Franco).  But of course, he must always save the world.  Soon however, he must fight Octavious as his demented alter-ego Dr. Octopus comes to the service with a vengence, and Mary Jane gets engaged to someone else.<br /><br />This is ambiguous and heavy stuff, especially for a big-budget summer action flick (and a huge action flick, with a budget of $200 million).  But director Sam Raimi and screenwriter Alvin Sargeant have higher goals.  They stick to the story and tone of the comic books,  giving the film has a sense of integrity and rich charcter development that elevate to the realm of greatness.  The quiet moments have tha same amount of impact has the big ones, but Raimi does not hesitate to pull out all the stops for the action sequences, seamlessly combining CGI, puppetry and Billl Popes' astounding camera work into one adreanalized package.  Spidey's battle with Doc Ock are breathtaking, climaxing in an above-ground train fight that leaves one absolutley brain-boggled.  But more imprtantly, the filmmakers put the focus squarely of the characters and their relationships (good, bad and ugly), "Spiderman 2" achieves nothing short of greatness and longevity, encompassing the best of what comic book films have to offer.</p></body></html>

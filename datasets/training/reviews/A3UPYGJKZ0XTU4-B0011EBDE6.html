Motivated to bond with his brothers after a near-fatal accident, Francis Whitman (Owen Wilson) arranges a trip to India for himself and brothers Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman). The idea is make a "spiritual journey" of a cross-country train trip aboard The Darjeeling Limited, following a careful, laminated itinerary. But the brothers don't trust one another, for good reason, and Francis has kept their destination a secret.<br /><br />The Darjeeling Limited is a functional train created for this movie, which was filmed aboard the moving train. There couldn't be a better advertisement for Indian tourism. The train is absolutely charming, with handpainted artwork adorning the corridors, colorful, tasseled chandeliers in the dining car, and a profusion of lovely cobalt blue everywhere. I have no idea if this remotely resembles a real Indian train. It seems like an exotic, whimsical version of a European train from the pre-World War II era. But the production design by Mark Friedberg is a true gem, not to be missed.<br /><br />"The Darjeeling Limited" has a low-key, slightly bemused, wryly comic, but good-natured tone, to which I attribute its success. It's familiar, but I have never seen a film able to sustain this tone for the duration. It doesn't slip even as the characters' situation vacillates from comic to tragic, or when they get off the train. Even the humor doesn't interrupt the flow, which is aided by a great soundtrack. I found it all pleasantly hypnotic. The visuals are beautiful. The odd characters seem utterly natural in this environment. This is the best role for Adrien Brody since "The Pianist". Wes Anderson's films are hit-or-miss for me, but this one is a hit.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2008): You have the option of viewing the film with a prelude entitled "Hotel Chevalier" (12 min). It concerns an encounter between Jack and his girlfriend in a Paris hotel room. It's superfluous and would create a hiccough in the film's pacing. I strongly recommend viewing the film without it. You can always watch it afterward. There is also a making-of featurette called "The Darjeeling Limited Walking Tour" (21 min). Production designer Mark Friedberg shows us around the train, and there is behind-the-scenes footage of filming. And there is a theatrical trailer (2 min). Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in Spanish.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Everyone Counts"></head><body><p>Nearly five years after the tragedies of 9/11, we get two remarkable films that skillfully focus on a certain aspect of that horrible day.  Oliver Stone brings us the survival story of William J. Jimeno (Michael Pena) and John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) in every explicit detail.  The events develop quickly.  The movie focuses on short little scenes that work like snapshots from two family photo albums.  The day is recreated with all its mundane details, just waiting for everyone to have the rug pulled out from under them.  The unbelievable slowly reached our consciousness, and so it did even for those closest to the drama.  Just like 'United 93' we are given a section of the horror as it unfolds.  Both movies are reinactments; both use news footage and narrative to frame the story.  We soon see the building collapse, and the two brave policemen are captured beneath the rubble when they wisely ran for the elevator shaft.<br /><br />Then, the movie moves slowly.  Their ordeal becomes our ordeal, and their waiting becomes ours as well.  Their interspersed memories fill the narrative as any life would pass before one's eyes.  It becomes unnerving as rubble and fire pass their way past both heroes as they cling to life.  A pistol goes off accidentally from a colleague who didn't make it out alive.  We go back and forth to the homes where the news is settling in, and it becomes more desperate as the hours go by.<br /><br />People should decide if they want to see movies like 'United 93' and 'World Trade Center'.  One should respect that for some it is too early.  (It was/is an awful reality.)  But, for the rest of us, these movies are well-constructed and ably focused.  The former is more of a reinactment; the latter is more of a movie.  Both are both, and each offers a worthy chance to assimilate the events and grieve once more.  The world after the Millenium has reawoken us out of a dream state after 9/11, and movies that are this realistic can be healing and help us cope to the realities 9/11 presented.  A story of survival can plant the seeds of hope, especially when these seeds of awareness can help thwart a near disaster, like the one recently planned at Heathrow.  Oliver Stone says he has no political agenda.  This is no rationalization, but the blunt truth.  He even has two short, courageous speeches presented by President Bush and Mayor Guiliani meant to help us through the crisis.  He does the men, the families, the survivors, and casualties justice in his rendering of that awful day.  He also shows that the best of us can shine through in calamity.  In the end, just like 'Schindler's List,' everyone counts.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Uncle Walt's Timeless Gift."></head><body><p>Nearly 2/3's of a century later, Snow White &amp; the Seven Dwarfs still has the power to enchant and amuse and beguile.  The restoration is fabulous, with clean, crisp &amp; clear picture and beautiful digitized sound.  It looks and sounds as it must have been intended, if not better, and this first full-length animated story still delivers.  Your children and grandchildren should love it.<p>There are two Discs just chock-a-block with goodies.  There are documentaries, background stories, features on animation, games for the kids, galleries of original drawings, deleted sequences and so on.  As much or more than you ever wanted to know about the making of this landmark film.  There is so much to see that more than one viewing is essential.  <p>I found the influences of European artists Disney brought in to create the overall look of the film, evoking German fairy tales, interesting.  Of course there is the inevitable Disney Co. commercial inherent in some of the presentation (they are a Marketing juggernaut in case you didn't notice), but that is to be expected and is minor.  The different Special Features are beautifully presented with new animation and different human guides.<p>If you are interested in what went into making a landmark of animation, you will certainly find something of interest here.  If not, you still have the marvelously presented feature itself. <p>After viewing most of all of the 2 discs, what struck me most was a renewed respect for Walt Disney's courage and vision.  He continually bet the farm (with brother Roy backing him) on his own gut instincts &amp; intuition.  That, and his absolute demand for craft and creativity and excellence.  I grew up with Uncle Walt, on TV and successful,  and it is good to remember that he had no safety net or guarantees when he layed it all on the line for what he wanted to do.  He was a true American genius, a crazy combination of savvy entrepeneur, craftsman, artist, visionary, gambler, and Marketing whiz.  He was one in a million.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Best Movie of 2002"></head><body><p>Without a shadow of a doubt, &quot;Insomnia&quot; is the best movie of 2002. Los Angeles detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) has been sent up to Alaska to investigate a homicide. In the small, quaint city, Dormer is on pursuit for a psychological killer and fights with a faulty past. While searching for the madman, Dormer loses sleep due to the atmosphere and his personal guilt. The movie does a good job with the setting and the lush scenery is perfect for the story's mood. The film centers around the characters and it's surprising to see Al Pacino not make so much noise. It was great. Robin Williams in a different role and Hilary Swank was kicking major buttocks. Kudos for the director Christopher Nolan with this follow-up to &quot;Memento.&quot;</p></body></html>

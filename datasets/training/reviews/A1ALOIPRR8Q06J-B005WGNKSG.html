<meta name="summary" content="Men Who Hate Women"></head><body><p>I guess I should have read the book.<br />Great acting, interesting location, some mildly compelling drama and suspense and lots of monstrous men raping and murdering. And watch the movie in the language it was made.<br />--SPOILERS--An 'empowered' genius female hacker with a big dragon tattoo teams up with an investigator to solve the mystery of a missing girl. She was abused as girl, then by her case worker handling her rehabilitation. She also gets assaulted by men in public. And it turns out the missing girl was repeatedly raped too and was just one victim among countless others of a murderous serial killer rapist Nazi relative and another rapist, serial killer relative. It isn't surprising when they're revealed. I was intrigued by the parallels between tattoo girl and missing girl. Lots of abuse. And a perfect finish to one villain repeats the fate of another. That's what you get when you mess with... The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo! You get burned, baby. Male pigs. I found out after watching the movie the book was originally titled "Men Who Hate Women" but was changed for marketing purposes. Smart move. But it can't be argued the author's chosen title doesn't fit his story.<br /><br />I'm curious to see what David Fincher does with this material because stylistically speaking this film adaptation has the feel of a made-for-TV film. Come to think of it, the story is of the sort that typically runs on the "Lifetime" channel in the U.S.</p></body></html>

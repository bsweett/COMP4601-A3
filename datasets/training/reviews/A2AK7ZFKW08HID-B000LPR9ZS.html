<meta name="summary" content="Great movie, this is where they should have stopped."></head><body><p>This movie was another great horror movie. This is just as good as the second one in my opinion. The brain surgery scene was one of the most disgusting scenes I have seen in a movie in a long time. This is where I believe the series should have stopped. This would have made a great trilogy, but unfortunately Hollywood doesn't know how to quit when they are on top.</p></body></html>

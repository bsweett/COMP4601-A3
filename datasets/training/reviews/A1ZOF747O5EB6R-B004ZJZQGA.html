<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Modern Drama"></head><body><p>"In Bruges" was an unexpectedly pleasurable film.  Its title really gives nothing away as to the film's contents.  Bruges, a wonderfully maintained medieval town in Belgium, serves as the backdrop for European gangster genre film with a slowly moving but compelling pace and an exciting denouement.<br /><br />The essence of the story is that two Irish hired killers are sent to Bruges by their English boss to "lie low" after a botched killing in England.  The killing of a priest has also caused the inadvertent death of a child.  To the boss, this is unforgivable.  Indeed, it is revealed that the only reason for sending his underlings to Bruges is that so they can have a pleasant holiday before the bungling killer is, himself, killed.  When this task is also bungled, the boss, played by Ralph Fiennes, comes to Bruges to do the task himself.  No more failures by incompetent staff.<br /><br />I'll say no more about the plot for fear of giving away too much.  However, there are fine acting performances by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as the killers.  There is also a captivating role played by newcomer Clemence Poesy as the love interest to Colin Farrell.  This girl is beautiful and excellent in her role.<br /><br />"In Bruges" will probably fail to gain a wider audience as it is deemed to be "art house".  So often, this is the kiss of death for a film.  It seems to imply no action and, therefore, no interest.  This is not the case with "In Bruges".  Guns and death form part of the story.  However, this is not to suggest that the film is a Hollywood action film.  Far from it. "In Bruges" is simply a very good modern drama with a number of fine individual performances.</p></body></html>

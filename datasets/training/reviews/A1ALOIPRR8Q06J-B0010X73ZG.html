But, I do enjoy survival thrillers or whatever the specific label is that applies to "The Mist". (I can't remember right now. There is a well used label for just about every type of movie.) Anyway, I like this type of horror flick where you have people trapped, surrounded by some sort of monsters, they struggle to survive, fight the monsters, and then try to escape. The most interesting thing is the fighting that goes on between the people trapped together. Now, that is what works best in "The Mist" to me. The scariest monsters ultimately become some of the people your stuck with. And the movie is ultimately about us and our society. Well it's human nature too, that we are faced with, perhaps just as much as whatever has to do with America. The made-up monsters and nightmare scenerio in which a diverse group of people, a cross section of citizens -sometimes from very different backgrounds, becomes an exploration of real world social problems. Honestly, put me up against the monsters unleashed upon the town anyday, over some of the townsfolk(or city folk, to be fair). (I'm serious. You do NOT want to be trapped with Jesus Junkies if you want to survive.)<br /><br />Why the 1 Star deduction: Rating systems like this are kinda silly anyway, but 5 stars only go to works of perfection like "The Shinning" which is a perfect horror film classic. CGI is abused like hell by filmmakers these days and it's a shame. If they're going to use it I wish they'd use it well. You can tell when they cut corners and did not spend that extra time (and money)fleshing out the details of a creature. If you ain't got the funds to do it right, just leave more up to our imaginations please. Our imaginations are not all ruined by countless hours of video game play. A great idea is to still use puppets and models with CGI which can have incredible results. In several years all this CGI cr*p (&lt;-I don't know what words we can use on Amazon)is going to look much worse to us than it already does, leaving films of this period as dated as 1950s adventure films that used stop-motion puppets.</p></body></html>

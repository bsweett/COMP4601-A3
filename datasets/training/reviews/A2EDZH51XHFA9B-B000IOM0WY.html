Gary Gray, 2004)<br /><br />Gray (The Negotiator) once again takes a top-notch cast and does something good with them. Not great, mind you, but good. But then, how bad can a movie be when your cast list includes Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, Mark Wahlberg, Seth Green, Jason Statham, Mos Def, Franky G, and two members of the Boo Yaa T.R.I.B.E.?<br /><br />Very loosely based on the 1969 film of the same name (the writers of the new script watched the original only once before writing, in order to not be overly influenced by the original), The Italian Job opens with John Bridger (Sutherland) and hs crew of professional thieves doing a hefty job in Venice, making off with a fortune in distinctive gold bars. Without revealing any spoilers, after the heist, one of the group turns on the rest, and the remainder of the film is about the rest of the group's attempt to get the spiols from the job back. As that small synopsis should tell you, this is an action movie, and it's pretty much neverending action (much like Gray's last feature before this, A Man Apart). There's not much original here, and you'll see the movie's twists coming long before its actors, but lots of stuff blows up, the actors all play their roles to the hilt, and there are a lot of one-liners to throw around at work the next day. A good turn-your-brain-off kind of movie. ***</p></body></html>

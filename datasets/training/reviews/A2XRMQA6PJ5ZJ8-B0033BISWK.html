<meta name="summary" content="An allegory about prejudice"></head><body><p>This flick is extremely imaginative, although I feel obligated to note that its basic theme has a fair amount in common with "Alien Nation." The film is done mostly in documentary form. A huge alien spacecraft comes to rest over Johannesburg, South Africa. Eventually humans board the ship and find about 1 million destitute and starving aliens. Due to their crustacean-looking appearance, they are derogatorily nicknamed "prawns." The film revolves around a scenario in which the South African government seeks to relocate the "prawns" to a reservation in the South African hinterlands, away from the big city.<br /><br />There is not much in the way of characterization in this film.  Part of this is because the aliens themselves are essentially portrayed mostly as ignorant slum-dwellers who mainly only speak their own language. The poor treatment meted out to the aliens is, unfortunately, all too plausible and this is the real point of this film.<br /><br />This one is worth a try for science fiction aficionados and given its limited budget and lack of big-star cast, it is impressive in its own way.

<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic powers, maybe, but film is merely okay"></head><body><p>As the current wave of digital special effects superhero movies go, the Fantastic Four doesn't match to others in the genre like Spiderman 2, the first X-Men movie, or the recent Batman Begins.  Like the X-Men, the F4 are a team, but what's central to the film is the personality dynamics and clashes that occur between its four members, Reed Richards, Susan Storm, her brother Johnny, and Ben Grimm, whose alter egos are respectively the elastic Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Girl, who can also generate force field, the Human Torch whose temperature can go up to a supernova, and the Thing.  In the movie, it's the bratty, arrogant, smart-aleck Johnny who comes up with their names.<br /><br />As the film begins, the four are working for Victor Von Doom of Von Doom Industries.  An outer space experiment goes awry as the team and their boss are caught up in a cosmic storm appearing earlier than predicted.  Back on Earth, everything seems fine, until they discover their special powers.  However, for Ben Grimm, who's transformed into the yellow, rocky behemoth, is less than thrilled, as he stays the way he is, coupled by his wife's leaving him.  He is thus the one most eager for Richards to find a cure to their condition, an eagerness than turns to impatience and frustration.<br /><br />Part of that is due to Johnny, who's carefree, insulting, bratty attitude grates on his nerves.  I know-it sure did mine, as I've never seen anyone as obnoxious since Tom Cruise's character in A Few Good Men.  In a scene where the Thing crumples Johnny's expensive red Porsche into a compact ball, I mentally raised a fist in the air.  "Well done, Thing!"  Johnny's the only one for the four who celebrates his condition, and the special effects of him as the Torch are actually laudable.  His flaunting attitude causes trouble for the other members, who want to be discrete so they can be left alone to find a cure, and for Doom, for whom the publicity causes his company's decline.<br /><br />Much of the film focuses on Richards' attempts to reverse their condition, meaning to recreate the cosmic storm in the Baxter building.  However, there's also a subplot involving Reed and Susan, who were exes, but Reed was too focused on his work, so Susan drifted off to Victor, who was more a take-charge kind of guy.  Their predicament unites them together, as they try to sort out why their relationship ended.<br /><br />Given Victor's last name, it's clear as to who he eventually becomes, but he too is affected by the aftereffects of the storm, and he turns darker as his stockholders decide to jump ships following the catastrophe.<br /><br />There is a feeling that too much was being attempted in F4, the romantic subplot, scientific experiment subplot, conflicts within the members, which I found the most interesting thing in the movie, and later with Doom, and the two major action sequences.  But at least the Thing's clich&eacute;d line "It's clobbering time" is used only once.  The ones to watch are Michael Chiklis (Ben Grimm/the Thing), Jessica Alba (Susan Storm/Invisible Girl) for obvious reasons, and despite what I said before, Chris Evans (Johnny Storm), with Julian McMahon (Victor von Doom) being a pale corporate head turned villain.<br /><br />At least it's better than Daredevil, and hey, in terms of action movies, I've seen worse.</p></body></html>

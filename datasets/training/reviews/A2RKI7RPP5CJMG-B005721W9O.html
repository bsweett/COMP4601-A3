It is dead-on with its parody of sci-fi television, the actors involved, and the herds of loving fans who, admittedly, do take their science fiction just a little too seriously.  If your a fan of shows such as &quot;Star Trek,&quot; &quot;Farscape,&quot; or &quot;Doctor Who,&quot; you'll definitely identify with this movie.<p>What makes this movie so unique, however, is the fact that it uses the sometimes fanatic behavior of sci-fi fans who take their favorite shows too seriously and puts that passion in actual aliens who believe the crew of &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; are real.  <p>It pokes fun at just about every stereotypical sci-fi fan.  From youngsters who argue over certain inaccuracies about the ship with the &quot;captain&quot; to average looking folks trying to mimic their favorite vixen from the show, it's all here.  Overacting, underappreciated and Shakespearian-trained co-stars fed up with miserable catch phrases, child-stars trying to break from the past, etc.  The stereotypes overflow.<p>As a science fiction film, &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; stands quite well on its own.  The special effects are brilliant considering this is plugged as a comedy.  The acting is superb, especially Sigourney Weaver, who pulls off being a dim-bulb blonde in great contrast of other characters she has played.  Tim Allen, Tony Shalhoub and the rest of the cast are perfect.<p>This is a fun film worth owning, especially if you love your science fiction with a great story and brilliant visuals.<p>Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

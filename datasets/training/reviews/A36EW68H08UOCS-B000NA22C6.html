<meta name="summary" content="Johnny Depp gives a fine performance in a serviceable story"></head><body><p>Stephen King may be the most prolific writer in the English language.  Just the number of films produced from his works is staggering.  And films made from his stories include sublime ones like "The Shawshank Redemption" and terrifying ones like "Carrie" or "The Shining". Along the way there have also been a few real stinkers like "Cujo", "Christine" and "Children of the Corn".<p>Secret Window ranks somewhere behind "Misery" in the story department, and it's easy to find comparisons between the two.  In both stories the main character is a writer - like King himself - and in both stories the writer finds himself in some remote location where they are threatened by someone who finds fault in their writing.<p>In this movie Johnny Depp's Mort Rainey is the Stephen King surrogate.  We meet his nemesis John Shooter in the first scene, where Mr. Shooter tells Mr. Rainey that he is very unhappy that Mr. Rainey has plagiarized an unpublished manuscript that Shooter has written.  Shooter is played by John Turturro as a menacing man from Mississippi with a broad-brimmed hat.<p>The suspense piles up as the threats from Shooter escalate to violence that no one in the movie thinks is under control.  At many times Rainey behaves with less sense than a teeny-bopper in Friday the 13th part gazillion, then in the final act his behavior is explained, sort of.  The ending, for some reason, reminded me of the ending of another King book/movie: Pet Sematary, and I won't give anything away by saying *why* it reminded me.  Let's just say I thought it a typical King fluorish.<p>Not a bad way to spend 2 hours.</p></body></html>

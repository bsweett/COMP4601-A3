The first time, I thought it w the perfect example of overblown avent garde, with redeeming visual factors. The 2nd time, I was drunk, so I liked it. The third time (gotta give everything a chance) I realized I liked this movie more than the second time, even with the flaws. I flat out found it intriguing. wanna get this? Okay. Close your mental eyes. You have no short term memory. I mean NO short term memory. Anything that happened 15 minute ago has evaporated from your brain. The only way you can identify (NOT REMEMBER!Only long term memories exist) with anything, is by the photos in your pocket, or the bold tattoos you've had inked on your arms and legs. each of these are a direction to solving the murder of your wife, and the bludgeoning that resulted in your memory loss. Now, don't trust anyone, especially those who proclaim themselves to be your friends. Not a bad premise eh? Now, live your life in reverse from a seamy hotel room you're not sure if you rented... The only clues other than the tattoos (they are new each time you wake up) are notes you've jotted down on the backs of polaroids you THINK you've taken. The result? You are basically (...)no matter what you do.<p>The actors? Don't worry about any big names other than Joe Pantelione He's the best of the bunch.<p>I can only tell you this, I was very weirded out. If you enjoyed Things To Do In Denver (Andy Garcia/Christopher Walken) you will count this as a film to watch three times.</p></body></html>

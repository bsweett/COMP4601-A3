<meta name="summary" content="One of the beset movies of 2004...Bring on the Oscars"></head><body><p>I went to see a matinee of Collateral show expecting a much different movie than I saw. I was expecting a lot of violence, over the top characters, and not to much of a story. What I got instead was possibly the best movie of 2004.<br /><br />Max(Foxx) drives a cab in Los Angeles for a living. He says it's his side job and his plan is to one day run his own limo service. He takes pride in his work in being the best cabbie in LA. He picks up Annie(Smith)who bets him her way to getting to downtown is faster. He wins the bet and charms over the girl. He's to shy though to ask for her number when she leaves. She comes back and gives it to him, and we see that Max really is a nice guy whose plans are taking him longer than expected.<br /><br />A man quickly enters the cab. He asks Max to take him to his destination and Max give him an ETA. After he makes the ETA the gentleman give him a proposition. He'll give him $600 to drive him around the whole night. Max reluctantly agrees to the man. He introduces himself as Vincent(Cruise) and says he looks forward to a great quick evening.<br /><br />Things quickly turn bad when a body falls from the second floor onto the cab. Max realizes Vincent just killed the man though Vincent just says "I shoot him, the bullets and the fall killed him." Vincent takes Max hostage and tells him he will drive him around town or he will kill him. Now Max is stuck with Vincent as he takes him to murder people. The ultimate target though is the DA Annie who Vincent just met and likes. Now he must stop Vincent and save innocent people before they die.<br /><br />The acting in Collateral is terrific. Jamie Foxx is great as Max. This is a different role for him. He's known more for his comedy and cocky characters like in Any Given Sunday. Max is an Average Joe kind of guy we can all relate to. His plans aren't coming as fast as he wants them to. Foxx plays the role to perfection and he has me really looking forward to seeing him play Ray in The Ray Charles movie later this year.<br /><br />Tom Cruise steals the show as the killer Vincent. It's a much different role for Cruise because he's the bad guy. He takes the bad guy and runs with it. Vincent is a cold killer who does it for a living. He has no remorse for the people he kills. He's confident in his abilities but not cocky. He'll do anything to achieve his round as he shows to Max in brute force. Cruise brings an intensity to the character. He's charming when he needs to be and we see that Tom Cruise we love. He becomes Vincent and is flawless. This is one of his best performance of his storied carear and is as good or if not better than some of his Oscar nominated performances. At this point he has to be the favorite for what should be a "Best Supporting Actor" nomination.<br /><br />Michael Mann directs this film to perfection. A lot takes place in a cab and he utalizes a a lot of different camera shots so you don't get bored during all the dialogue. He allows the characters to develop in the movie and thats what makes the movie drive. He shots the fight scenes to perfection especially the big one in the club.<br /><br />Steven Beattie wrote the movie and he has himself an Oscar caliber screenplay here. His only other big time writing was with Pirates of the Carribean and he exceeds that here. The script is beautiful. It's comical when it needs to be. The dialogue never drags and it isn't boring. He doesn't waste lines in the movie and it's why the characters develop so well.<br /><br />Collateral is a great movie. The critics nationwide have loved it. It's not some cheap action thriller. Michael Mann doesn't let us out that easy but puts together a great action thriller with character and substance. The movie is flawless. There isn't anything not to like. Bring on the Oscars because this movie deserves some and maybe Tom Cruise can finally get one because he sure does deserve it. You don't want to miss Collateral.</p></body></html>

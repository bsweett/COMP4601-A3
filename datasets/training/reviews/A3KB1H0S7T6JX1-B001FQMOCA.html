<meta name="summary" content="A movie worth watching!"></head><body><p>Walk the Line sheds light on the life of the well-known singer Johnny Cash.<br /><br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.<br /><br />The only major setback is in relation to Ginnifer Goodwin who is not that great as Vivian Cash.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="not the most outstanding of Sly's outings"></head><body><p>Having not remembered anything from the original Rambo trilogy other than  the films were pretty kickass (I was ten when I saw them), I can't be asked to compare the fourth installment to its predecessors. i can, however, tell you that I enjoyed the fourth movie. As a punch-them-up thriller with lots of explosions and gory, bloody scenes it works pretty well. Sly is a bit too old to be running around killing people, but the script gives him plenty of reason to stay in one place and puts a lot of action onto the other cast members. The action sequences are done decently, but the acting from the cast (not so much from Stallone as from everyone else) is subpar even for an action film. Also, Stallone must be a 24 fan because he freely steals Jack Bauer's conviction from season 6, "Live for nothing or die for something." Overall, this is a pretty high-paced action film but it feels mostly strained and the terrible acting weighs it down. But it should be commended, if ever so slightly, on bringing the Burmese situation (and, therefore, the situation of all ailing, fighting, and struggling countries) to the attention of the American audience.</p></body></html>

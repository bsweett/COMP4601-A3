<meta name="summary" content="If you ever considered knocking over a jewelry store, watch this first and reconsider"></head><body><p>An engrossing, extremely well acted, but very dark film.  For you fellow fans of old crime novels, this is the kind of story that would be at home in a Jim Thompson, David Goodis, or James M. Cain book.  Flawed characters, broken relationships, hopeless situations, it's all here.<br /><br />To paraphrase director Sidney Lumet in the well-done "making of" featurette on the DVD, "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a classic style melodrama, but with "melodrama" being meant in a complimentary sense.  That is, the film isn't meant to be campy or overacted, just "amped up", depicting people and situations at their various breaking points.<br /><br />Lumet also noted in his comments that good melodramas always have the situations driving the characters, not the characters driving the situations.  That may be true to some extent here (the characters certainly have to react to a lot of intense developments, which serve to reveal their innermost, hidden traits), but their basic personalities certainly influence the events, too.  For example, if Philip Seymour Hoffman's "Andy" character wasn't so cold and calculating, he never would have devised the attempt to rob his parents' jewelry store in the first place, and if Andy's brother wasn't so fearful and jittery (likely due to a lifetime of intimidation by his brother), he never would have brought in his loose-cannon friend to help with the robbery, which of course turned out to be a disastrous move.<br /><br />In any event, this dark, violent, sexy crime tale is strongly recommended for fans of tough crime tales.  Just don't expect hearts and flowers at the end and you'll do just fine.</p></body></html>

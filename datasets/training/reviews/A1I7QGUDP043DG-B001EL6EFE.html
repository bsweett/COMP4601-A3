<meta name="summary" content="Delightful!"></head><body><p>This is delightful family entertainment. There were more than a few chuckles, as well as a subtle lesson for children (and a reminder for adults), that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Our family especially enjoyed the antics of the penguins. The music is also well suited to the movie and compliments the energy of the animal characters. You'll be tempted to get up and dance. If you no longer have young children, buy and save this one for the grandkids...<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

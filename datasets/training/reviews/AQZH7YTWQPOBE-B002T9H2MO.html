<meta name="summary" content="Moon mystery"></head><body><p>Initially, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T9H2MO">Moon</a> might seem like a remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48SG">2001 - A Space Odyssey</a> - it even has a HAL-like computer called Gerty - but it takes a different turn. In fact, after the first half-hour, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T9H2MO">Moon</a> is more about lunar technician Sam Bell's mysterious origins than space exploration. The plot is surprisingly thick and takes some unexpected turns. I won't spoil it, but it's definitely pretty cool.<br /><br />I love the ambience of the movie. The sterile, white setting really does seem like a realistic portrayal of man's future in space. The eerie silence  (there's not much soundtrack) adds to the effect. Soon into the movie, you'll feel like you'r right there on the moon base.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended. This didn't seem to get much attention in theaters, but it's definitely one of the better and more original releases of 2009.</p></body></html>

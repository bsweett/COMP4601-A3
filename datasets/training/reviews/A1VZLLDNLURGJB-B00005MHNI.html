<meta name="summary" content="A Clockwork Orange - Kubrick has done much better"></head><body><p>I recently saw for the first time Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange and really feel that he has done much better work.  I know that I am going against the flow on this one but this movie was just not what I expected.  I rate it at three stars because of its technical quality, however, I can't see sitting through this film again and the experience improving one bit.  In fact, I think it would be more painful to watch with each viewing.  As always, I don't know what Kubrick was trying to tell us but I really don't think I will take the time to try to learn with subsequent viewings.  This is the one and only Kubrick film I did not love!</p></body></html>

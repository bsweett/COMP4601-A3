The words that were filled with sea tanged royal marine life, felt as if you were beside the men manning the deck, paving the way for a battle upon the high waves of the ocean, near some mysterious tropical island or remote tossing about like a toy on a world of water. The movie fills the screen with two excellent actors, one is Russell Crowe and the other his name forgotten, yet his skill in the performing arts shines. The movie reflects the camaraderie of the men and their well founded esteem for the capitan and the doctor. There are men of all ages, the youngest being pre-teen. They all are excited to be serving the crown, fighting against the French fleet. The movie is about the cat and mouse pursuit between the Surprise manned by the Brits and the Avature bespoken by the French. Russells ship or Captain Jack's ship is not as well made as the stronger faster rival. The movie shows the chase and their strategies in finally meeting and fighting for the prize. The images in the film are so beautiful with color and the desire to be in that moment. A sumpetious feast of symbolic brilliance. The crashing waves filled with dark mystery. The bounty floating below the wooden rails, ships brimming with perfumed fruit and lovely native men and women selling their wares. I loved the scene where the men share their dinner, young and old with anectadotes of their travels and meetings with important others. The crystal and the silver, the meals prepared by the grouchy cook. The nautical equipment was visually attractive to look at and creating imaginings of yourself in that experience. The music and the friendship displayed by Stephen the doctor and the captain. Their respect for one another, tested by the lessons of life. I especially liked the expeditions journied by the doctor learning about faraway lands and animals that had not been logged in books. His drawings and his discoveries plus his knowledge at doctoring patients, crusty with salt and young with beads of sweat. The sweltering heat when the sails sat still as did the ship upon the smoothed over wrinkles of the deep blue. The grand adventures that came from their voyages, like the Gallpagos Islands fed my yearnings for faraway places. Bon voyage.</p></body></html>

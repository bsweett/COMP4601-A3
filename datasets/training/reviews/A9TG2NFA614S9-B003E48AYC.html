"Alice in Wonderland" (2001 in 3D and IMAX) takes great liberties with Lewis Carroll's books, and drags them into the world of the surreal, the violent, and nuttsyland. There's a lot of claptrap and scary stuff in this one, and I think it will frighten some younger tykes. The bad Red Queen with a huge head literally and figuratively is played by Helena Bonham Carter. "Off with their heads" is her constant refrain.<br /> At the beginning of the movie when Alice is among ordinary people, she doesn't look well with those dark circles under her eyes, kind of a haunted look. Mia Wasikowska plays Alice. A young woman, she is at her engagement party, and she doesn't want to marry the foolish fop her mother is pushing on her. She wanders off and drops into the world she had been in as a child, Underland or Wonderland with its weird characters. Alice's father had told Alice all the best people are mad so she shouldn't worry about her fanciful imaginings.<br /> Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter, and he becomes a pivotal character. There's Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the fat roly-poly twins, the March Hare, the disappearing Chesire Cat, the hookah-smoking Blue Caterpillar (Abosolom), and the White Rabbit. At one point Depp recites part of Lewis Carroll's famous poem "The Jabberwocky" in which Carroll used some of his invented portmanteau words. The jabberwocky is a species of dragon that Alice has to slay on a Frabjous Day.<br /> If you are looking for a faithful rendition of Carroll's 1865 masterpiece, you best look elsewhere. This is kind of a mishmash with fantastic colors and special effects. Alice grows to giant size by drinking a potion and then shrinks to tiny size by eating cake. The Bandersnatch is a monster pursuing Alice, The aim is to depose the evil Red Queen and reinstate the good White Queen.<br /> On its own terms, disregarding fidelity to its source, this movie can be fun and also enlightening because of all the interesting vocabulary introduced. It's a deluscious treat. Carroll might turn over in his grave, but Disney would probably be pleased by the result though it's not as tame as his original stuff.</p></body></html>

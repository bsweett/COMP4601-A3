But, at second sight, the movie is a merciless metaphor that emblematizes the dark years after the WW2. it's not a mere coincidence the arouse of the Noir genre began precisely since 1946, in which the ghosts, phantoms and dragons nestled during these oppressing years got out from the Pandora' box. The dark experiments about genetics well known during the Nazi Germany (Do you remember QB VII from Leon Uris ?) didn't come at end when the War was over. Furthermore, these cruel exercises of experimentation continued with or without the total consent of many regimes around the world. Brainwashes, hypnosis, subliminal messages, induced behavior patterns intermingled with many needs of an emerging market that desperately needed to blossom -if you may- as cathartic device in order to forget the horrid memories of a recent past.<br /><br />Dark films like Stalag 17, Shock corridor,  Psycho,Invasion of the body snatchers, Them, The man with the golden arm, Bitter victory, Catch 22, The planet of the apes, The island of Dr. Moreau, Dementia 13 or THX 1138, were part of many films that explored and felt the necessity to express the dark side of the moon as product of a brave new world that now had to deal with the consequences of the nuclear issues, radioactive residues, contamination and pollution. But there was something more in the air, the political environment (the well known witch's hunt undertaken by then), was also at its most algid moment. Spies everywhere plus the tensions derived from the Cold War were motives far enough to forge a social corpus in which the insanity and the spiritual wounds made to blossom the birth of the rock, the cool jazz and the new rebel kids of the Literature as Alan Gingsberg, Jack Kerouac or Camus, Sartre, Andric, Hamsun on the other side of the Atlantic.<br /><br />These reflections are present and suggested in the film, through audacious metaphors and apparently coincidental facts.<br /><br />Kingsley as always steals the show (He is one of the ten greatest actors in the world); Max von Sydow is superb too in his brief cameo, Mark Ruffalo plays a sensitive but crucial role and Di Caprio exhibits punch and talent.<br /><br />A worthy to watch film.</p></body></html>

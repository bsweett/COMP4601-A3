<meta name="summary" content="Hilary Swank does the "guy thing" again."></head><body><p>Million Dollar Baby is my favorite Clint Eastwood film along with his Midnight In The Garden of Good and Evil, The Bridges of Madison County, and last year's Mystic River. Casting Hilary Swank as an aspiring female boxer is the best thing about this film, because she has the ability to go to the extreme musculine side like no other girls in Hollywood can. Just take her Oscar-winning role in Boys Don't Cry for example. It's very convincing especially she had gained more than 15 lbs of hard muscles as result of preparing for her role in this film.<br />Swank plays a cafe junkie waitress(Maggie) who sometimes eats left-over steak in order to save money to train at Frankie's gym. She grew up in a disfunctional family. Daddy died early, and her mother is fat, heartless, and her siblings are nut cases. To her, boxing was all that she loved and hoped to make it big if Frankie would train her. At first, she gets rejected by Frankie, because he doesn't trian girs, and also he has a dark past with his estranged daughter. Maggie didn't give up, and continued to train on her own. Meanwhile, she gets advice from the gym's janitor(Morgan Freeman), who used to be a professional boxer until he was brutally beaten and lost sight on one eye many years ago. He wanted to help her, and eventually convinced Frankie to take her. Frankie finally decided to train her when the guy that he had trained for 7 years walked out on him to find another manager.<br />After many months of intense training, Maggie had become a professional, and started to win in local matches. Eventually, she made it to international championships and won those matches as well. She used her earnings and bought a house for her mama, but she not only was ungrateful, she even said nasty things about her for being a boxer. Maggie was devastated and she became more determined to go further with her career. Then there's the world boxing championship to fight against "The Blue Bear", who was almost defeated at the end of the match and she punched Maggied when she wasn't looking. Maggie collapsed, and her neck hit the chair! She past out instantly, and was parallized afterwards.<br />Frankie fell very remorseful for having train her, and see her became a "vegetable". Then Maggie makes her ultimate decision about her life, and it was upto Frankie to help her one more time.....<br />It was very moving to see Eastwood breaking down in the church. He had a great deal of chemistry with Swank and it was wonderful and touching that they bonded and he was not only her trainer, he had became a father figure. He should get a best directing and acting nomination for this film.<br />This is Hilary Swank's career best performance since Boys Don't Cry, and she will probably get an Oscar nomination again.<br />I rarely watch movies about boxing, with the exception for Raging Bull, and Beautiful Boxer(a Thai film). This is  a very entertaining, moving, and uplifting film. It doesn't have the depressing tone like Mystic River.</p></body></html>

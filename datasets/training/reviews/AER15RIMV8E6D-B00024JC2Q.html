<meta name="summary" content="Starsky & Hutch For A New Generation!!!"></head><body><p>If you have seen the original series in the 70's, you may or may not like this version. Because it's more funny, and they get Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughan, Will Ferrell, Amy Smart, Carmen Electra and Snoop Dogg to be in it. So they wanted people that young adults and teenagers would like. Pretty much everyone from 'Old School' is in it. It's still very funny. It even has cameos from the original Starsky and Hutch! If you love comedy, and the original series, maybe you'll love STARSKY & HUTCH!!!</p></body></html>

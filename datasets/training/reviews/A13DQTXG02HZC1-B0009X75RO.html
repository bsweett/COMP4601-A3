Many of my friends went to watch this movie in the cinemas and they told me it's good.  Then, "Chicago" won six Oscars.  Still, I relented.  To me, a good movie would be that it's still watchable and enjoyable years after it's released.  The decision was a good one.  Catherine Zeta-Jones was simply spectacular in her role as Velma.  Her background in musical showed through.  Her experience and her confidence oozed through & thus, her personality suited Velma to the dots and tees.  Renee was also brilliant in her role as Roxie but one couldn't help noticing her cautiousness in doing the numbers.  However, her presence was so relevant to the twenties.  Richard Gere, Reilly, Queen Latifah were all excellent in their roles.  What made their performances even more admirable was that all of them sang and danced through "Chicago" and they were all amateurs before this.  The additional features let us have a better appreciation of the casts in their roles by tireless and countless rehearsals.  Whilst the razzle dazzle was impressive, the movie had a serious undertone, the analysis of the change of America's society.  We were brought to the attention of women's enpowerment, the power and people's vanity towards media's exploitation, greed, indiscretion.  "Chicago" was every bit a show-stopper and it's a DVD collection worth having at home.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Makes You Exquisitely Uncomfortable"></head><body><p>This is a great film.  By placing ethical and political dilemmas in pure and absolute "win-lose" terms, Chirstopher Buckley forced us to see clearly that our systems of justice and democracy demand forceful, effective advocacy.  If this makes us squirm with righteous indignation, well, then we should try to make a different system - and so far, no one has.<br /><br />Demagoguery can be found on any side of any issue.  If this movie draws a moral line, it is around how loyal a boss needs to be with a high-performing subordinate.  I found is fascinating that even the main character, himself, would fairly conclude that his employer had no option but to fire him for what he did.  Yet, from a moral/dramatic view, we must side with him when he "pays back" his former employer.<br /><br />It's complicated and I don't want to spoil the movie by revealing plot, etc.  However, you'll have a great, if unsettled, time watching it.  And the acting is great!</p></body></html>

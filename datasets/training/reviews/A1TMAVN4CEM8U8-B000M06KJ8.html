I had read about her saying "Let them eat cake" for years, when she asked why the peasants were rioting during the French Revolution and was told that they had no bread to eat.  What I didn't really realized until watching this movie was how sheltered and out of touch she was.  She was only 14 when she was packed off to marry Louis, who she had never seen before, was stripped and inspected for blemishes when she reached the hand off point( how embarrassing) and had something like forty people sitting around her bed watching on her wedding night.  "Nothing happened, apparently."  Well duh?<br /><br />Kirsten Dunst gives an excellent performance as the teenage queen, in this movie which starts off set in Austria in 1768.  She spoke German, by the way, not French.<br /><br />Highly recommended for students of History who want a better insight of this period of European history.

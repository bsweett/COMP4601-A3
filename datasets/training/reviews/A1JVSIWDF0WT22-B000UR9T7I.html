Pathetic sequel with character situations not that different from a bad "Three's company" episode. The dance sequence should be more than enough to lock Maguire a Razzie next year and personally I've heard more than enough advice from Pete's aunt to last me a lifetime. Even the action sequences, so similar to those in 1 & 2 are just not that exciting anymore. I can't believe the same great director and writers of #1 & 2 made this one. I would strongly suggest they hold #4 for a big while, at least until we are able to get #3 out of our system.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Sledgehammer of a Thriller."></head><body><p>Now, just a few years ago, the world was taken by storm by the Swedish-language film adaptation of this incredibly successful book (which I have not read yet), and the world was taken similarly by storm by Noomi Rapace, playing the intense, fierce and wholly independent Lisbeth Salander. It's a good film with a great performance by Rapace, and that has translated to high profile roles in English-Speaking cinema now, with a major role in the most recent SHERLOCK HOLMES film and the main character in this summer's upcoming PROMETHEUS.<br /><br />Now, aside from a few films (PANIC ROOM and THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON), David Fincher has always hit the mark (SE7EN, THE GAME, THE SOCIAL NETWORK, FIGHT CLUB), or came as close as he could (ALIEN 3). Like all of his great films, this is a film packed with amazing performances, and like all of his great films, there's one performance that over-shadows all the others, and with this film, it's Rooney Mara, again as Salander. However, the major difference between the Swedish film and the English film (other than the different languages) is the power of the film. Where I was left feeling somewhat empty after viewing the Swedish version, I felt totally fulfilled by Fincher's film, adapted by Steven Zaillian, one of Hollywood's premier wordsmiths, and performed with versatility and power by its cast, again with Mara at the forefront, but other than the rather forgettable supporting performances by the Swedish film's cast, such as Michael Nyquist playing a too-stilted Mikael Blomkvist, here for the part of Blomkvist, we have Daniel Craig, who is a far superior actor to Nyquist, and shows the versatility, charm and intelligence of the role. I feel that Craig was pretty short-changed as far as any of the acclaim of the film is concerned, as was Stellan Skarsgaard, playing Martin Vanger with great skill. Also short-changed is Fincher's skill as a director. While I didn't really care for ALIEN 3 as a whole, I felt that Fincher had an interesting enough vision, and he more than exceeded my expectations for that vision with SE7EN, which is strangely kind of a companion piece to this film. But if anything, Fincher's skill behind the camera has only grown since then, and this film shows him possibly as his height as he manages to make this a whole and complete film that can stand alone, despite the two other parts of Larsson's MILLENIUM trilogy. Hopefully, Sony Pictures will look at the eventual returns of this film that include home video sales and will conclude that Fincher, Mara and Craig should return for the sequels.</p></body></html>

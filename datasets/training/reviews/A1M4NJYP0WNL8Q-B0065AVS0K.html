The subject of this two-disk + graphic novel extravaganza is a film that dramatizes the Sin City graphic novel series written and drawn by Frank Miller.  Miller's storylines are archetypical noir set in a city where it is always night, and the darkest night at that.  People just plain don't come to good ends in Miller's work.<br /><br />The original release weaves four different Miller stores.  The Hard Goodbye is the story of Marv (Mickey Rourke), a not-quite-borderline psychotic, who finds a moment of love only to have the woman killed as she sleeps next to him.  Revenge is slow in coming and not the least bit sweet.  Then there is a tale about Hartigan (Bruce Willis), an ex-cop who takes on a child killer and goes to prison for it.  Years later he gets to wrap up the grim loose ends.  The Big Fat Kill finds Dwight (Clive Owen) pitted against a crooked cop (Benicio del Toro) who doesn't know how to stay dead.  Next thing you know all the women of Old Town are in a war. And The Customer Is Always Right is a short that offers little explanation but somehow brings the story together.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez's direction is brilliant.  Rather than remake Miller's artwork, he sets out to match it stroke for stroke.  This is one of those rare films where an adaptation of an artist's work is the next best thing.  Deft use of black and white with vivid splashes of color, capture the original's intensity, the framing and scene setting are inspired, and the casting is outstanding.  Even if you are put off by all the violence, sex, and harsh language, you will have to admit that as a piece of film work, Rodriguez has recreated Sin City perfectly.<br /><br />I prefer the original film to the recut and extended version though.  The original interweaves the stories, which gives the view not only a better sense of timing, but also highlights the connections between the stories.  In the newer version you experience the stories one at a time, and while this may make things easier to follow, the common threads in this film about the price of vengeance in a lonely world don't come through as effectively.  The interviews, commentary, and other extras are quite good, though, so this is definitely the version to buy.</p></body></html>

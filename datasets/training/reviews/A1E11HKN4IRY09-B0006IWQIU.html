With all of the above bad qualities ALIEN VS PREDATOR still remains decently entertaining.  This film will probably be a better view when released as a spec. ed. dvd with the vast ammount of footage obviously cut out restored.  Here's what it is; a cheesy sci-fi actioneer with some great fx and a heap of bad dialouge that caters to fans of both franchises that are just tuning in to see some battling space nasties.  That's it.  AVP is not a good movie.  It is satisfying in some strange manor, though, and would fair better if so much meat was not cut off.  Some disspelling; the acting isn't bad at all, it's the character development and lack of plot that suspends believable players.  The fight scenes with the Aliens and Predators are cool.  They don't resemble wrestling matches, but would benefit from some more limber Predators (they are, after all, giant stuntmen in heavy suits).  This movie is great entertainment on a Saturday afternoon when you don't want to use your brain and like to witness some halfway decent extraterrestrial carnage.  Sure, it could've been made ten times better, but at least it's ten times better than the lowest point in the series- ALIEN: RESURRECTION.</p></body></html>

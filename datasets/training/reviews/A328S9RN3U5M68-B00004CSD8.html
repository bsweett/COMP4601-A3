<meta name="summary" content="THE OMEN: A More Humanistic Approach"></head><body><p>Remembering the 1976 new film THE OMEN this viewer recalls someone making a dog growling sound in the parking lot at movie's end and how that effect sent gasps and chills through those who had just witnessed Damien and his dogs - a sign of a thoroughly successful thriller.  Now thirty years later (and having the original effect watered down by the subsequent three sequels) out comes a remake of THE OMEN and once again the story and production values of the film jolt even the more staid viewers.  Armageddon now seems frightfully at hand!<br /><br />Though the script is essentially intact form the original version, this OMEN is cast with actors who make the story more credible because they imbue it with more humanly drawn character interpretations.  Much of the power of the film lies in the superb performance by Liev Schreiber as the politically important father of a 'stillborn' son that was 'exchanged' at birth: he gives a warmth and honesty that were elusive in Gregory Peck's performance. Much the same can be said about Pete Postlethwaite's tormented priest who tries to alter the events threatened if the 'adopted' strange son Damien is allowed to mature, and to David Thewlis as the photographer who helps Schreiber's character come to grips with the decision he made about child swapping on the day of the birth of Damien.  Mia Farrow, cosmetically enhanced to look oddly young, is the smarmy nanny and Michael Chabon gives a bit of class to the priest with the dreaded secrets on how to end the impending destruction if Damien is allowed to live.  The weak link in the cast is Julia Stiles who here just can't seem to inhabit the role of the increasingly terrified mother of Damien: likewise the child selected to portray Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) appears more a makeup artist's vision rather than a child whose apparent normalcy could have made the evil within more terrifying.<br /><br />The special effects are used well as is a musical score by Marco Beltrami (though not nearly as memorable as that by Jerry Goldsmith in the original).  An interesting finding is that the original 6-year-old actor portraying Damien (Harvey Stephens) is cast in a tiny part here as a tabloid reporter, giving the feeling that the spirit of Damien is still pervasive.  Director John Moore gets most of right. Not a bad movie as many have stated and one that certainly could have been more powerful with some casing changes, but this film still causes the jitters in an otherwise tranquil evening!

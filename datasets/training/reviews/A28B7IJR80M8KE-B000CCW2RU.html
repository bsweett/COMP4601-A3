<meta name="summary" content="A serious cautionary tale about the dangers of cloning...."></head><body><p>With all the debate as to whether cloning should be done legally is still a question, but this film to me is a depiction of what we can expect if it ever becomes legal, there is no question that the rich & powerful would do just about anything to live forever, & this film depicts that very well, In this film Ewan McGregor is Lincoln Echo Six who is part of a underground group of people who believe the world has been contaminated & that the Island is free of this contamination & a lottery is a ticket to the island when in reality it is a ticket to death where your organs are harvested to your original host after a they become terminally ill, Ewan is experiencing dreams & starts to believe that everything is not what it appears to be, when he discovers a butterfly in the industrial area of the complex, his suspicion is futher aroused, the director of the instituion is played by Sean Bean(Hitcher) who tries to convince him otherwise, Scarlett Johansson is here as another clone who Ewan becomes attracted to & makes a desperate escape with her when he learns the truth, she has just won & he knows her terrible fate is at hand, they do get away & later meet up with Steve Buschemi who earlier befriended him, he explains the whole scenario to them, & Buschemi like always is just as funny here with his explaination with phrases like.."why do I have to be the one to tell there is no Santa Claus"...or when asked why the donors are unaware of these practices, he says..."just because you like a hamburger, doesn't mean you want to meet the cow"...as with most Michael Bay films, there is plenty of action set pieces & Scarlett & Ewan have good chemistry, their reaction to the real world is a bit comical at times, but Bay keeps the action at a fast pace, the first 45 minutes are a bit slow, but after that it doesn't let up, there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been said, but this one of Bay's better films that almost got ignored in theatres, why, I don't know, this is definately one to see.</p></body></html>

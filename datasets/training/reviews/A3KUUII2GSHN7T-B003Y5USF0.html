<meta name="summary" content="Helen Hunt in her most annoying role to date."></head><body><p>Is it just me or is Helen Hunt an annoying actress? As for the film, there is great action and solid special effects.  It's just that Helen Hunt is so obnoxious in her role in this film. <p>Bill Paxton does a solid job but one can't help but realize the nose dive his career took after this film was done. Oh well. Twister might have you wanting to become a storm chaser when it's all said and done. I know I gave it some thought.</p></body></html>

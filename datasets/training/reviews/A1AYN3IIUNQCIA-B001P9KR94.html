<meta name="summary" content="A Rousing, Thrilling, and Exhilerating Film"></head><body><p>A mix of kinetic energy, an undertow of suspense, and a dash of Dicken's, Slumdog Millionare has become the breakout indie hit of the year. I was drawn to the film after its win at the Golden Globes and after viewing it, I can see why there is so much fuss over it.<br /><br />The story is a familiar one, abliet with a refreshed, updated feel. Young Jamal has become an overnight sensation after his amazing streak on India's "Who Want To Be a Millionare?". With just one more question left to win big, the question on everyones mind is, how on earth did this kid from the slums, with no formal education, stable living conditions, and answering questions that have stumped dozens of contestents before. Slowly, we are taken back in time and shown Jamal's life, as each question he is asked pretains to a certain event in his life. All the while, he hopes to find the love he lost long ago, and maybe even come on top.<br /><br />The film literally crackles with intensity. The locations are awashed in a bright gold color, the camera is fast and moving (though no so much to make you dizzy), and the music is so lively and kinetic that it's almost like your actually in the movie with these characters, with Danny Boyle being the main person involved in this, injecting so much life and vibrancy that the film just pops off the screen. He also manages to equally balance the drama, humor, and tenderness of the screenplay without it coming off as to heavy handed.<br /><br />All the cast members do great, and while there is no particular standout, they all equally play of each other and hold their own scenes, with no one being overshadowed or underplayed.<br /><br />But what I really liked about the film was that (minor spoiler) unlike most other drama films, by the end of the film, you feel so happy and lifted that you just want to jump up and down as Jamal goes for the million dollars. I can't remember the last time a movie has actually made me grab my seat in suspense, baiting my breath, hoping and praying that Jamal actually wins it all and gets the girl. Plus, the Bollywood dance at the end was just so spectacular.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionare is definintly one of the best films of 2008, and whether your a Bollywood fan, drama person, awards seeker, this is the film that has everything for everyone. You do not want to miss it, Slumdog really is that one film you can't miss.</p></body></html>

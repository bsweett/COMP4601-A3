However, this movie's theme is about doing something about it, and to that end the film takes Jenna on a magical mystery time voyage which lands her right where she thinks she wants to be ---- 30 - COOOOOOL & HOT!<br /><br />But is that exactly what she wanted?<br /><br />THANKFULLY THERE'S MORE ---- IT'S ABOUT SELF-AWARENESS<br /><br />There is a price to pay for this jump to age thirty, and as the movie progresses, Jenna becomes more aware of that and more importantly; MORE 'SELF-AWARE' IN THIS LEARNING PROCESS!<br /><br />-----*- THE CAST<br /><br />Jennifer Garner  - Jenna Rink<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo  - Matt Flamhaff<br /><br />Judy Greer  - Lucy Wyman<br /><br />Andy Serkis  - Richard Kneeland<br /><br />Kathy Baker  - Beverly Rink<br /><br />Phil Reeves  - Wayne Rink<br /><br />Samuel Ball  - Alex Carlson<br /><br />Marcia de Bonis  - Arlene<br /><br />Christa B. Allen  - Young Jenna Rink<br /><br />Sean Marquette  - Young Matt Flamhaff<br /><br />Kiersten Warren  - Trish Sackett<br /><br />Gina Mantegna  - Gina<br /><br />-----*- THE FILMMAKERS<br /><br />Gary Winick  - Director [ also Directed the NEW -"Charlotte's Web" - 2006]<br /><br />Josh Goldsmith  - Screenwriter [also wrote - "What Women Want"]<br /><br />Cathy Yuspa  - Screenwriter [also wrote - "What Women Want"]<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD: GOOD VIDEO/AUDIO QUALITY AND WIDESCREEN TOO!<br /><br />There were featurettes about the making of the film, but they were much leaner than I would have liked since this, after all, is a fantasy film for girls.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: DEFINITELY WORTH SEEING - RESONATES STRONGLY AMONG TEENS: ESPECIALLY GIRLS<br /><br />Much in the same tone as "The Wizard of Oz","13 GOING ON 30" takes the thoughts and ideas of a disgruntled young girl, and plays them out in full fantasy form, with somewhat the same outcome. "13 GOING ON 30" is definitely one of the better teen flicks out there, and it nicely melds fantasy with a girls viewpoint into a somewhat familiar though original story.</p></body></html>

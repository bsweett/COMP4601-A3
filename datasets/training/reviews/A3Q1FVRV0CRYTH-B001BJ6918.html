<meta name="summary" content="Exacting sweet sweet revenge"></head><body><p>In this day and age when sequels like `Matrix Reloaded' and such pollute our cinemas and ruin the glory of their predecessors I am pleased to have found a sequel worthy of its name.  `Kill Bill Vol. 2' is really less a sequel and more a continuation, but call it what you may, it still works.<br /><br />Picking up where `Vol. 1' left off we have The Bride (Thurman) exacting her revenge against the men and women that killed her friends and family, but there's a twist.  The unborn child she thought was murdered was in fact preserved.  The question remains that will her child with Bill change her plans to kill him?<br /><br />Filled with brilliant acting on all counts, Daryl Hannah and David Carradine reprising their roles as Elle and Bill, each of them doing brilliantly to bring the right amount of emotion and character to their roles, this movie is raised from action blockbuster status to Oscar caliber.  My favorite performance though is from Michael Madsen who plays Budd; a man who knows what they've done is wrong but isn't prepared to die for it.<br /><br />This film is somewhat slower than the first and focuses more on The Bride's emotional battles than her physical ones.  That doesn't by any means take away from the enjoyment received from watching this masterpiece.  A perfect companion to the first film, Tarantino and Thurman deliver a great film that will be remembered as classic for a long time to come.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Starts off good, gains momentum"></head><body><p>Lots of movies I liked pretty well the first time I saw them weren't nearly as appealing when I see them again some years later.<p>I recently saw this movie for the third time on DVD, and darn if it doesn't get more delicious every time.<p>The writing is so crisp it snaps.  The acting is so pleasurable it's like being ring-side at a 3-ring circus.  The direction, photography, set design, art direction, etc.<p>I hear often in recent reviews that Jack Nicholson is given roles where he gets, essentially, to play Jack Nicholson.  This is not to imply that Jack is any flavor of heartless romance writer with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - but it means that the &quot;Jack&quot; we get to see in this movie seems a good guy to spend 2 hours with.  Helen Hunt, Cuba Gooding, Jr and Greg Kinnear make perfect stand-ins for our desire to &quot;hang out with Jack&quot;.<p>This is the movie that &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; desperately wants to be - yet this film exceeds that more recent work by pretty much every measurable marker.  <p>I'll watch this film probably once a year as long as I live.  The one time I saw Something's Gotta Give was enough.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fantasy and Squalor!"></head><body><p>Slumdog Millionaire is set in Mumbai (Bombay), India's slums focusing on a young boy Jamal Malik (Dev Patel)<br />He is a "slumdog", which is slang for street-kid.<br /><br />The first scene opens up on Jamal who has somehow been selected to appear on India's Version of the TV show, "Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"  Jamal is not expected to win because of his disadvantaged roots, but he has had some unique experiences as a kid that enable him to guess the answers correctly.  Many flashbacks are shown as he is interrogated by police on how he knows the correct answers to very difficult questions.<br /><br />The story flows and moves at a good pace.  The life experiences of terrible poverty and treatment of children in Mumbai are both sad and somewhat funny at times.  The children know no other life.  The movie is full of life experiences as we see Jamal growing up with constant challenges.  He falls in love, comes close to death and overcomes many hardships. Everything ends tied together in a neat little package.</p></body></html>

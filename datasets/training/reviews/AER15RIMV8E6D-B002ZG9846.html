<meta name="summary" content="Better Than I Expected!!!"></head><body><p>I saw this a few hours ago with some friends, and we all thought it was hilarious and incredibly bloody. I wasn't expecting too much, but I was pleasantly surprised. A dorky teen named Dave Lizewski begins wondering why people haven't decided to be real-life superheroes. When he buys a costume on the internet, he goes around and tries to help people and says that his name is 'Kick-Ass' He inspires Big Daddy and Hit-Girl to stop a drug dealer named Frank D'Amico. They soon decide to work with Kick-Ass because they are all on the same team. Will Kick-Ass, Big Daddy, and Hit-Girl be able to take down the powerful drug lord? I highly recommend KICK-ASS!!!</p></body></html>

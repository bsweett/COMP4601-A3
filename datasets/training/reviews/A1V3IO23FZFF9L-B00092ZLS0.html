<meta name="summary" content="Another DeNiro turkey"></head><body><p>This is a mix of bad terror cliches and a really bad plot. DeNiro has made another crap movie. Gone are the days of Taxi Driver, now we get this mediocre excuse of a movie. Fanning doesnt help the movie at all. All she's good for is to look in a catonic state.</p></body></html>

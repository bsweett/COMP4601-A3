When you can't find a plot, resort to the next best thing --- lots of explosions, special effects, and violence.  I remember when devotees to this &quot;epic&quot; anticipated &quot;Reloaded&quot; like it was the 2nd Coming.  Once &quot;Revolutions&quot; finally was released, the prevailing attitude was, &quot;well we wasted our time with the first two --- we might as well see the damned thing to the end.&quot;  It almost seemed as though the viewers were reluctantly performing a chore, like cleaning out the refrigerator of all of the old scary experiments nestled on the back shelf.<p>Now the marketers try and tell us this is the &quot;greatest cinematic trilogy of all time.&quot;  Uh-huh.  Sorry folks, that honor would go to &quot;The Godfather,&quot; even with the relatively weak 3rd installment of that series.  I can only hope that the Geekowski brothers keep their word and do not release a 4th Matrix movie, because this was more than enough.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="NOT BUYING THIS DVD VERSION!!!"></head><body><p>I liked the first transporter and I bought the DVD. After some months they was close to come out with "transporter 2" Came out with another version of the first transporter with more extras and DTS sound. And double dip us like most DVDS releases these days..I work hard for my money and getting smart of these double dip studios B.S these days!And suck up more money from us. This time for sure not going to get this version DVD and be a smart pants and wait for the DTS version, like they did with last one.  FOR SURE going to be another version of this one too! Yes I loved the movie was a lots action and was great.But if u want to see it just rent it for now. I guess better be safe then sorry.</p></body></html>

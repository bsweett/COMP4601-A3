(if the Griswolds had been vacationing in London during the Rage Virus season)"></head><body><p>Yet one more commentary on man's folly, 28 WEEKS LATER brings us back to that place of stark, stark terror and dead end fortunes: London. It's 28 weeks later, and things look to be safe now for the repatriation of a desiccated city. Fifteen thousand civilians have already been allowed to move in again, under the watchful eye of the U.S. Army. But one survivor turns up who is found to be immune to the rage virus, an immense discovery which could potentially lead to a cure. But it's a double-edged sword, as this survivor now also becomes an Infection carrier - as everyone soon horrifyingly finds out. So, 28 weeks later, it all begins again.<br /><br />No, this one isn't as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMA8">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>, which set a new and stylish benchmark for horror. 28 WEEKS LATER, while sleek and scary and shot with vitality, doesn't quite give off that same vibe of bleakness and hopeless inevitability. This one also has a faster pace and more action. But both 28 DAYS LATER and this sequel aren't about saving the world or finding a cure. No, they're about sheer survival, about getting the eff out of Dodge without getting mangled or bitten or gouged or snacked on. And it's about fighting as hard as you can for your loved ones and friends. Because of this, these films tend to affect us more on a personal, primal level. These panicky, desperate characters resonate more with us. We're no brilliant scientists or superheroes out to save the day; we're basic blokes trying to make it out alive. And these films, they'll slug you in the gut.<br /><br />The premise unerringly targets one fear within us all: fear of the virus, whether it's the flu virus or the plague or, heck, even a computer virus. There's just something so frightening and debilitating about an infection which leaves us helpless and which could spread so widely, rapidly, and exponentially and seemingly has no cure. The monsters here aren't really zombies in the old-fashioned sense. They don't crave to munch on your brains. Instead, they're fueled with an unquenchable and mindless rage. They'll run you down and catch you and inflict massive pain and intolerable violations upon your person. If they happen to munch on your brains, it'll probably be accidental. Another factor which punches up the horrormeter needle is that the Infected aren't slow or shambling like your grandfather's zombies. Instead, these are savage, bestial wackjobs who chase down their victims with electrifying alacrity.<br /><br />Don't look for the characters in the first film; they're not here. The focus instead is on a tiny band of folks, which includes a sister and her little brother (who also might be immune), a military medical officer, and an intrepid Army sergeant. As they struggle to flee to safety, they not only must elude the murderous Infected but also the military, whose mandate has been drastically elevated to Code Red, which basically means that the fit's hit the shan and now all civilians are considered lost causes. These kinds of films, I really hate it when I find myself pulling for a character. I know the odds are my favorite might buy it at any given moment. It's doubly chancy when you happen to like a lot of them. Those four I mentioned? I liked them all. It's a pity.<br /><br />You get caught up in the oppresive mood of the film. First of all, the chilling, driving score will make certain of that. And the very good and willing cast won't let you down, either. I started getting that edgy, crawling-under-the-skin feeling right from the opening minutes, and when that knock rapped on that door, brother, I was already yelling at the screen: "Don't you open that bloody door!" But of course they did. Then come the first bits of horror. But don't get the impression that it's all remorseless terror and jugular veins getting munched. There are let-ups and times for winding downs, fleeting though they are, and, admittedly, there isn't much respite in the latter half of the film. But juxtaposed with the bloodletting and -curdling are moments of serenity and sweetness, as when Andy and Tammy motorbike it back to their home and we get to enjoy the tranquil, eerily empty streets of London. But, of course, that's only to set you up. There are several disturbing and graphic scenes and a harrowing sequence staged in a pitch dark, subterranean setting, with a rifle nightscope as the sole means of vision.<br /><br />A bit now on the special features, which are actually worth spending time on: there's the pretty interesting audio commentary by the film's director and producer, both of whom share co-writing honors; 2 deleted scenes (a cafeteria scene and Andy's fractured subway dream) with optional commentary; the 13-minute-long "Code Red: the Making Of" featurette; "The Infected" featurette- (7 minutes long, and you get to meet the Infected movement advisor); the "Getting Into the Action" featurette (7 minutes); 2 so-so animated graphic novels: Stage 1 -"Development" (7 minutes long - featuring Warren and Clive, who, while attempting to invent a rage inhibitor, unwittingly give rise instead to the Rage Virus) and Stage 3 - "Decimation" (4 and a half minutes long - two humans in an Infected-populated London battle it out); and, naturally, the theatrical trailer.<br /><br />An expert exercise in evoking goose bumps and night chills, 28 WEEKS LATER might also leave you a bit depressed and maybe even wrung out. But in a good way.</p></body></html>

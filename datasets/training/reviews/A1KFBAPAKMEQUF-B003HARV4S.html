<meta name="summary" content="Romantic"></head><body><p>Although I prefered "The Prestige" (both came out around the same time), I must admit that this movie was well-acted and very romantic.  Simple story.  Boy meets girl. Boy is poor, girl is rich.  Romance is out of the question and the two are forcefully separated.  Boy grows up and meets grown up girl again and instantly the romance is rekindled. An evil prince stands in the way and an exciting plot ensues to free the girl.<br /><br />Two thumbs up.</p></body></html>

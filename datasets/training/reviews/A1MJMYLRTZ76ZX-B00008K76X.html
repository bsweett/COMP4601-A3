<meta name="summary" content="Decent movie"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. Morgan Freeman is always good, and Ben Affleck does a nice job as the young CIA analyst. The two picks for the American and Russian president are right-on--Ciaran Hinds as the Russian president is really excellent, as is James Cromwell as his American counterpart. And the guy who plays the CIA operative is good, too (unfortunately I don't know the actor's name). But anyway, he's a pretty cool cat in this movie, and just what you'd expect of an experienced field agent.<p>Also, the scene in which Affleck tells his fiance that he can't make their date because Morgan Freeman, the head of the CIA, wanted Affleck to jump on a plane to Russia with him is nicely done. It's short but provides perhaps the only moment of comic relief in the entire movie.<p>The scene where the fission bomb goes off has some realistic looking effects, too. Overall, I'd say this is a pretty good movie. Big Steve says go see it and don't Bogart the popcorn.</p></body></html>

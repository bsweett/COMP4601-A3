Bale stars as Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman, who is living the good life in the indulgent 80's.  By night, Bateman is a psychotic serial killer whose masterful routine is coming apart at the seams.  While it has uneven moments, Bale's star making performance is worth seeing American Psycho for alone.  No one else could have brought the character of Patrick Bateman to life better than Bale, and the rest of the cast, including Reese Witherspoon, Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Jared Leto, Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny, and Samantha Mathis; are great as well as supporting characters too obsessed with themselves to realize or care as to what Patrick is doing.  A spectacular satire and a showcase for Bale's talents; American Psycho isn't quite a classic, but it's pretty close regardless.</p></body></html>

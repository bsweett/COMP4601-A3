<meta name="summary" content="Ode To Familial Dysfunction"></head><body><p>A question:  What do you get when you mix a father who happens to be a self-help guru wannabe (Greg Kinnear); a foul-mouthed, lascivious (yet well meaning) grandfather (Alan Arkin); a sullen, rebellious teenager who refuses to speak (Paul Dano); a despondent, suicidal brother (Steve Carell); a cherubic, enthusiastic, young daughter (Abigail Breslin); and a frazzled mother trying to hold it all together (Toni Collette)?  Pick the daughter as a last-minute contestant for a preteen pageant hundreds of miles away, throw the family into a broken-down Volkswagon bus, and you've got LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, a delightful yet poignant comedy with a definite aftertaste.<br /><br />This is a film not for the faint of heart (there are some very adult themes that are vetted), and while the viewer is exposed to constant dysfunction and conflict and disruption, we do eventually learn that blood is thicker than water, as the Hoover family definitely circles the wagons when one of their own has her back against the wall.  The movie stays on track until the sudden flight from the hospital--when the metaphorical shark is jumped--yet for the most part LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is bawdy entertainment at its finest.  Special kudos to Carell and Arkin for terrific performances.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

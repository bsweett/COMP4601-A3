Seriously I thought this was a nice background on our favorite scary bad guy. Good acting and directing, great sets and costumes, and decent music make it worth at least a rental and probably a purchase if you are a fan of the other three movies. Seeing Hannibal from childhood gave us more insight into his psyche. Now here's the thing, most people will say that the cruelties Hannibal suffered were endured by many in Europe or Asia during WWII and they never tracked their tormenters down and ate their faces. They are right of course, but I still like the premise as to how Hannibal used his medical training to further cannibal cooking and the art of "How to Best Serve Man". So I recommend you rent it if you liked "Silence of the Lambs", "Hannibal", and "Red Dragon" or "Manhunter".</p></body></html>

The movie manages to hearken back to the days when every movie monster was pitted against every other, while retaining not a shred of the too-seriousness with which those movies took themselves.<p>The first thing to remember about Freddy vs. Jason is that this is in no way a horror film. Veteran action director Ronny Yu (probably best-known in America for The Bride with White Hair) tried that once, with disastrous results (Bride of Chucky). So he went back to doing what he does best: action flicks. This should be obvious in any of the big fight scenes; take away the makeup and put them in a big field of bamboo and you have Crouching Tiger, Over Hyped. Yes, folks, this is wire-fu, and probably some of the most amusing wire-fu you've ever seen.<p>Even though the big fight scenes between the two are the main focus, it's a Friday the 13th/Nightmare on Elm St. movie, so you have to have a complement of moronic teens as Jason/Freddy fodder. This time, instead of trying to break new talent (and really, how many of the Nightmare/Friday kids have gone on to stardom? Let me count them for you: two, Johnny Depp and Patricia Arquette), the crew racked up the body count with somewhat established stars. The Parade of Pretty Underaged Bodies is led by Lori Campbell (Dawson's Creek temptress Monica Keena) and her boyfriend Will (Joan of Arcadia's wheelchair-bound Jason Ritter, looking considerably less disabled here). The story goes something like this: Lori is part of a new generation of Elm St. kids, who are no longer afraid of Freddy Krueger. Since their fear drives him, he needs some way to get them scared of him again. So he raises Jason from his Crystal Lake grave and sends him to Elm St. in order to make the kids think Freddy's back (cue Alice Cooper music. Whoops, that was the OTHER series). Now (please ignore the giant plot hole) the last round of Freddy-inspired terror had happened four years previously, during which time Will thought he saw Lori's father murder her mother inside their house. The resulting trauma caused Will, and a number of the other near-victims (including Will's best friend Mark [Brendan Fletcher, who wisely disassociated himself with the Air Bud movies after the first one]), to be committed to a mental hospital outside town. (Lori knows nothing of this and thinks Will just moved away.) But after Jason commits his first murder inside Lori's house and Will catches a piece of a news story, he and Mark decide to escape and go make sure everyone's okay. Which, of course, they're not.<p>Perhaps the most inventive part of the storyline is the fact that you think you're being dropped into a Nightmare on Elm Street sequel, but (as far as I can tell from reading IMDB cast lists) this is a new storyline, created for this movie. Very subtle, and quite well done. But that said, everyone who's going to want to see this movie is going to see it for one reason: Freddy and Jason mixing it up.<p>Like I said, the fight scenes are wire-fu, so be prepared for Freddy and Jason bounding around in three dimensions like giant pinballs. (As Freddy says at one point during the first big dust-up, "oooooh... tilt. &lt;SLAM!&gt;) But then, expecting realism in a fight between two undead serial killers is kind of like expecting realism from a Monkees movie, so it doesn't really detract. Instead, you get the unstoppable object meeting the immovable post, and it's a lot of fun. And certainly a lot better than I thought it would be. ***</p></body></html>

The main characters in this movie are a quirky couple, Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet).  They have a wonderful relationship, yet time and familiarity slowly tears them apart through hurt and anger. A painful fight and cutting words cause Clementine to have a medical procedure so she can erase Joel from her mind.  Joel is hurt too.  The scenes flip from time to time and at one point we see Joel approaching Clementine in a book store where she works, and realizes she does not recognize him.  He  breaks doen in front of his friends.  As he becomes desperate with heartache and pain his friend sympathizes, and gives Joel a confidential card with the doctor's name that erased Clementine's memory of him.<br /><br />Joel then goes to Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) to get the same treatment as Clementine.  As his memories begin to fade, he realizes how much he still loves her.  He fights back in his mind as the medical technicians (Kirsten Dunst and<br /><br />Most of the movie is going inside Joel's mind during the medical procedure as memories of Clementine are erased.  The fantastic camera work showing memories coming and going, disjointed flashbacks and  eerie comedic tone is stunning to watch.  The cinematography and special effects throughout are utterly amazing, entertaining and truly communicate the happiness, hurt and strange unbreakable connections of true love.<br /><br />Carrey plays his part well, not his usual over-the-top characterizations, Winslet is wonderful as the free-spirited sprite and love interest.  There are excellent performances by Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo.  The actors give a topnotch performance, full of hip catchy youthful dialogue.<br /><br />This movie is fun and different.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a brilliant, thoughtful look at true love.  The acceptance of each others shortcomings, and forgetting and forgiving.</p></body></html>

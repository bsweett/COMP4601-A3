I went from `7' to `5', then to `8'; then the rating nosedived to `4' before finally settling on `6'. It's not that I didn't like the movie much but rather overwhelmed with too much happenstances that occurred during the film. In a certain way, the events that unfolded in Changing Lanes seemed to be over-the-top for me. The acting is not that bad at all, and I was at the verge of saying, "My dear Ben...you cannot act." before stopping myself, thinking that he was all right yet sleazy and so Ben Affleck-ish. Samuel L. Jackson holds his water. I think Changing Lanes is more of a story-driven film than by performances. Several moments during Changing Lanes seemed to be illogical to me. One particular scene where Gavin Banek pulls the fire alarm, resulting in activation of sprinklers, and goes to the boss' office to pull out a paper from a file cabinet. You know, at that point, the sprinklers are going off, the water is pouring around, and what are the odds that the water will not affect the document that Gavin was reading? Another scene where Gavin's car sees its tire go unhooked seems to be too good to be true. Normally when a car is left ditched, that car shouldn't have remained there for a long period of time. So, when Banek's car crashed, he gets out and walks past by the car. That's another fascinating coincidence. If Roger Michell had focused on two or three twists, Changing Lanes would have been more acceptable, but he decided to push the envelope too far. The ending wasn't all that satisfying for me, and I also got disgusted when Banek came to the school, where the black sons of the father attend, and made up lies about the father. That moment was unsettling and disappointing. Having William Hurt in a cameo appearance was a nice touch. Toni Collette, the lady from Shaft, looks like she is suffering from bone marrow cancer. All for its worth, Changing Lanes came off as a good, although provocative, film but could have been a lot better.</p></body></html>

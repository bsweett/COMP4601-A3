<meta name="summary" content="Yay! A comic book movie that [isn't horrible]!"></head><body><p>Let us pause to mourn the passing of the Kevin Smith script for Superman once more as we remember not so fondly the comic books to movies that have crashed and burned. It seems so easy to make a comic book into a movie. Comic books use frames and shots and the storyboards are already there, just adapt. Yet when they get to the screen, the tights look silly, the villains aren't what you expect and the whole thing seems to be an origin story even if you are familiar with these characters from long back.<p>This movie could have been horrible. There are so many characters in the comic book that the origin portion of the movie could have rivaled the original Superman for tedium. The cliched storyline running through the comic book has the theme of "oppression is wrong". <p>This movie gets it right by focusing on Wolverine and Rogue. Already the two most interesting characters in the comic, these are the ones you want to watch anyhow. Preserving the Wolverine loves Jean Grey and hates Cyclops storyline from early X-men helps to drive the story along. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are the best distinguished actors in Hollywood now that John Gielgud is dead. And there is a real plotline. Sure, it sufferes from the action movie problem of random bits thrown in for no reason, but you feel like someone actually sat down and wrote this. As opposed to most Batman movies where you think that a bunch of producers sat on the set yelling things at the director to do.<p>Of course there are problems and no comic book fan is going to love a comic book movie unconditionally. Sabretooth is supposed to be Wolverine's bigger and meaner double, but since they  hired a pro wrestler (and not a very talkative one) they didn't give him anything but a lot of grunts. Ray Park is a great martial artist which you can tell from his too-few-scenes. And a lot of the other X Men are just sort of there.<p>But still this is a fun movie and one that almost takes the bad taste of eitehr Punisher or Captain America out for only a moment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Actually, Three and One Half Stars"></head><body><p>Based on H.G. ("Buzz") Bissinger's book with the same title and directed by Peter Berg, this film focuses on the Permian (Texas) High School Panthers' 1988 season which ended in the state championship game played in the Houston Astrodome against Dallas Carter High School. Frankly, although I have lived in Texas for almost 30 years and am well aware of the passion which football at all levels generates throughout the state, I still find it difficult to believe the nature and extent of pressure which otherwise sensible adults place on the importance of winning games. Permian coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) is a case in point. If we are to believe Bissinger's account, Gaines was in real danger of losing his job if the Panthers lost the state championship game. (Interestingly, he and his team won it the next year.) The quality of acting throughout the cast is solid but several characters (e.g. Charles Billingsley played by Tim McGraw) seem stereotypical. For whatever reasons, Berg fails to develop any of the leading characters (notably Coach Gaines) beyond what would be revealed in a brief encounter at the local Dairy Queen. In fact, for me at least, the only sympathetic character (if there is one) is the team's star running back, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), and that's a bit of a stretch, given his peacock personality. The on-field action seems authentic, especially in the championship game. Among sports films, I rate Friday Night Lights comparable with Rudy (1993) and Remember the Titans (2000) but a notch or two below Hoosiers (1986), Varsity Blues (1999), and Miracle (2004). In terms of sustained suspense and dramatic impact, I rate it lower than, for example, The Last Picture Show (1991) with which it shares a few issues in common and Field of Dreams (1989) which, in contrast, celebrates innocence rather than denigrates it as Friday Night Lights does, albeit by implication.</p></body></html>

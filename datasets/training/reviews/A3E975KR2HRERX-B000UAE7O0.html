<meta name="summary" content="A decent "B" movie..."></head><body><p>but ol' roddy boy had to show his True colors in regards to (S)outh (O)f the (B)order problems, with the Murders, Kidnappings-leading to Murder after the monies recieved-, coyotes running up SOBs into America, drug running of CRACK cocaine, etc. That's barely mentioned in main Slime media and this happens like it does in france! Daily car burnings are only mentioned there in Traffic Reports now! Never mentioned here even in the a.p.~<br />_<br />He did finally showed his filthy colors with his newer flick called machete and Proudly backed the coyotes "right" to do what they do best. He Proudly stood behind the ILLEGAL ALIENS crying out to be US citizens like what happened in Reagans', clintoons' time to "correct" the problem.. did it work? apologies; that was rhetorical. This will be the Final time I'll ever buy anything from that scum for his #1 on the Flag of the United States of America!</p></body></html>

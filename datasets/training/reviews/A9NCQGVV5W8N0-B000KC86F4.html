<meta name="summary" content="Better Than The First Two..."></head><body><p>Although, lets be honest, it couldn't have been any worse now, could it?<br /><br />But let's not focus on the negative.<br /><br />Here's why it's a better film:<br /><br />- It has a better plot<br /><br />- It actually puts the mutants through some pain for a change (after two films of seeing them dance rings around humanity, they, like the characters from the truly awful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1MTZE">The Complete Matrix Trilogy (The Matrix/ The Matrix Reloaded/ The Matrix Revolutions) [HD DVD</a>], never really seemed to be in any great peril. Not so with this film. A weapon that can definitively rob them of their mutant natures levels the playing field).<br /><br />- It injects some moral ambiguity into the plot; you can tell that Ian McKellen (himself a legendary gay activist in the UK) relishes the chance to explore the concept of a cure for a condition (read 'orientation') that can mold one's identity whilst simultaneously making them a societal outcast in some quarters. Kudos to McKellen's performance - I actually found myself rooting for Magneto's brotherwood to prevail.<br /><br />Brett Ratner clearly feels less affection for the characters than Bryan Singer and in this case, that's no bad thing. I don't mind a director loving his characters as long he's not prepared to let that get in the way of the plot - something that Singer always did. I'll be honest, I wrote off the X-Men films after seeing the first two, but this one actually caused me to go out and hire <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCUO1Q">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a> the night after I saw this on television.<br /><br />Also major props to Ellen Page. She really is a talented young thing.<br /><br />Its not the greatest film ever made, but it is a road-sign to better things.<br /><br />Now can we have some proper "Sentinels" in number four, please?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Two of the great actors of our time.  But now they are old."></head><body><p>In real time & in this movie. Still in fine form. Jack Nicholson (Ed) & Morgan Freeman (Carter) meet in the hospital & become fast friends. Ed is lonely & fabulously wealthy. Carter is a scholarly mechanic with a large loving family & wife of 45 years. The movie may skew a bit to the older crowd but anybody can appreciate this movie. Besides, what over-50 guy has not composed a bucket list of sorts, things to do, places to see before death? Both men are given death sentences, months to live. They compose a list. Being asymphtomatic & having all of Ed's money to play with they begin, much to Carter's wife, Virginia's consernation. Beverly Todd cannot be 65 years old. A good looking woman. She wants Carter to die quietly in her arms. They do the things, racing a Cobra Shelby on a course, jumping out of a plane, visiting the pryamids etc. as they fly around the world (Ed has a private jet). It becomes a buddy/road trip. There are challenges that each has problems with such as Carter being faithful to his wife & Ed reconciling with his grown daughter. It is all done with humor & heavy doses of pop-philsophy. I can see director Rob Reiner fingerprints all over the place. It is all pretty entertaining. The ending of the movie is of course pre-ordained. Even that is amusing. Ed's words of wisdom that men over 60 can relate to: "Always know where the nearest bathroom is, never waste a hard-on & never trust a fart.</p></body></html>

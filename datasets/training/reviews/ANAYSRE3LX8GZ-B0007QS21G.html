<meta name="summary" content="Classic Example of over used CGI with no plot"></head><body><p>I cant write a reveiw on what the plot was about other then the world freezes over and it shows what might happen, with people trying to act around it.<br /><br />This movie is nothing but CGI overkill with no plot at around it except for a guy looking for his son. thats about all, oh and expect that romance crap around it that happens in every other movie.<br /><br />This is another excuse to use SFX and CGI in a movie without bothering to concintrate on a story line around it, the CGI might look good, but you do not have a good movie based on that alone, when are these people going to learn that CGI do not carry a movie?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Indy's back"></head><body><p>I was 1st in the door opening day for the first 3 Indy film.<br />I was unable to do this for this film.<br />The 1st film I waited to see since "Revenge of the Sith".<br />The last days of filming were done in my home town.<br /><br />It is a very good film but is the least favorite of the 4 films to me.<br />Why?  Could the audience follow these searches or understand what the heck was going on?<br /><br />Some of the script was not good.  How many of us got tried of Mutt & his old comments?<br />La  Beouf did NOTHING for me.<br /><br />Great to have Karen back.  The script between Indy & Marion on their relationship needed work.<br />I think Cate did a great job in her role.<br /><br />When a film starts out with the King that is good.  Still trying to figure out why Elvis's "Hound Dog" was not on the soundtrack CD.  They already had to pay you know a lot of money for use of the song in the film.<br /><br />Jim Broadbent, an Oscar winner, used in a TINY PART to make up for the death of Denholm Elliott & the Marcus Brody role.<br /><br />SEAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE FILM.<br /><br />The DVD package.<br />Man, nice but MISTAKES.  1.  It is 1 of those you have to open 1 end to get the package/DVD's out the other side.  TOO MUCH WORK.  2.  No chapter search list.  3. No bloopers or deleted scenes<br /><br />Good extras on it.  GUESS GEORGE WILL PUT THAT ON THE NEXT RELEASE OF THE FILM TO DVD.  YOU KNOW GEORGE, THAT WILL BE OUT IN A YEAR OR TOO.<br /><br />I am glad Indy is back despite the mistakes.</p></body></html>

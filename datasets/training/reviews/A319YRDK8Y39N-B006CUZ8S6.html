<meta name="summary" content="Builds on the strengths of the first film"></head><body><p>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets builds on what the first film did right and improves some of what it did wrong, providing an overall enjoyable, magical film for all ages.<p>With the opportunity this time to launch right into the story without the set-up and endless character introductions of the first Potter film, the Chamber of Secrets is able to focus on plot and improving the pacing problems of the Sorcerer's Stone. This one still, unfortunately, crams too much material from the novel into the film, proving that the filmmakers don't so much want to adapt it as recreate it verbatim (things that work on the printed page don't always work on the big screen). But what is plugged in this film does build a better cohesiveness then the Sorcerer's Stone.<p>The Potter kids are beginning to fill into their shoes the second time around, coming off as more confident in their popular roles. With deeper voices and early signs of becoming full fledged teenagers, the trio is becoming a group of talented youth. It seems that great things will come from them in subsequent films. The rest of the cast doesn't have nearly as much to do, and some talent, such as John Cleese's ghost of Nearly Headless Nick and Professor McGonnagall (Maggie Smith), seem wasted in what amount to cameo roles. But newcomers Kenneth Branagh as the ego-filled Gilderoy Lockhart and Jason Issacs as the evil Lucious Malfoy both vividly recreate two of the novel's great secondary characters. The late Richard Harris is also great in his small but important and final role as headmaster.<p>This second story in the proposed seven-book Potter series is considered the weakest by most fans and critics, and much of the problems of the book are nearly unavoidable in the transfer to film. The similar plot from the first book and movie sticks out most prominently here. But with much of the pacing problems cleaned up this time around, the end result is a better film.<p>What I find most enjoyable in Chamber of Secrets is the darker tone of the story line. There are moments here that promise the series will become more disturbing in subsequent films, a process that will help the films avoid becoming stale retreads of each other.<p>For those that enjoyed the first Potter film, this one will more than live up to your expectations, providing another wonderful look into this magical world. Those who didn't care for the original adaptation probably won't like what this one has to offer, despite the slight improvements in story telling and pacing. But to not be able to enjoy these magical films at least on some level would be unfortunate, as it has the potential to bring out a youthful wonder and exuberance in even the most hardened adult.</p></body></html>

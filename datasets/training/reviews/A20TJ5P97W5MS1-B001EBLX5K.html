This film was written, produced by, and stars the English comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. Cohen plays a journalist named Borat who is traveling through the United States from Kazakhstan. Borat travels through the American country side and interacts with what appear to be actual Americans. The results are at times hilarious and equally disturbing considering some of the thoughts and feelings of the individuals Borat interacts with. It is always questionable which element of the film is more funny: Borat's questions or the American's responses. This film could be viewed as a sign of the times. It attempts to uncover the mainstream American culture. Arguably the best part about this feature was the controversy surrounding it upon release in the theaters. Cohen did his homework and scored a hit.</p></body></html>

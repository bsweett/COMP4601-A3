Yes, I know that he writes horror stores but that is the extent of my knowledge.  So, I was surprised to find that I enjoyed "1408".<br /><br />The essence of the story is that Mike Enslin (John Cusack) plays a cynical writer who pens reviews of supposedly haunted hotel rooms.  And why wouldn't he be cynical?  Stories of haunted rooms are a dime a dozen and who believes in ghosts?  Well, certainly not Mike Enslin.<br /><br />After receiving some anonymous mail, Enslin books into room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in Manhattan.  He is implored by the hotel manager (Samuel L Jackson) not to choose the room.  There have apparently been countless largely unexplained deaths in that very room.  Enslin, however, is a persistent man and he will not be convinced of the dangers.<br /><br />At first glance, the room seems totally unremarkable.  But, after a short time, strange and sometimes chilling things begin to happen.  I can say that at times I was given goose bumps.  This film is largely able to find that delicate balance between schlock and horror.  This is a rare achievement as the film industry is littered with movies that are often trapped by the former whilst forgetting the latter.<br /><br />Without spoiling the remaining plot of the film, there is an explanation for much of the various unexplained events.  Yet, it wouldn't be a good horror story without a twist in its tail.  And this one also has a good twist.  Enjoy!  Best viewed in a darkened room.</p></body></html>

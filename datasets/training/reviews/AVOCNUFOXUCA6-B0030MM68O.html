<meta name="summary" content="OK movie but I don't see the "Best Picture" here"></head><body><p>"Hurt Locker" is a modern version of a movie that's been made dozens of times before for the plethora of conflicts in which the Federal Government has engaged.  The performances are great, and there is a lot of tension when it comes to defusing the bombs.  In a way, this is the old British WWII series "Danger UXB" (which is worth seeking out) tarted up with a big budget for the Second Iraq War.<br /><br />However, I didn't find this movie to be anything special.  When you get a title card that tells you how many days Bravo company has left on its tour, you know for a fact exactly what is going to happen to which member of the team, if you've ever seen a movie.  When somebody gets short, and they're in a cop or military movie, there's only one thing that can happen.  Sadly, that same cliche happens here.  The pace of the movie is overly slow.  I know they're trying to establish tension, but after 30 minutes there's no real story or plot and the audience is left wondering what exactly is going on.  We don't really get what the bomb guys are doing to defuse the bombs; they don't talk us through it or give any explanation, so you're also left wondering about the tension and when it's supposed to stop.  Hey, there's also the cliche "wildman" who breaks all the rules to do the job.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't hate this movie.  But, it's best watched with one finger on the fast forward.  I don't understand how this made "Best Picture."  I would recommend renting this before you buy it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great dialogue! Quentin Tarantino is brilliant!!!"></head><body><p>I have owned this movie for years, someone bought it for me as a gift and just yesterday I watched it for the first time.  I was completely blown away.  This film was so wonderful!  The dialogue was genius, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jakcson made a great on-screen team.  I can't put into words how great this movie was.  Go do yourself a favor and buy this, even if you haven't yet seen it.  You won't be dissapointed!</p></body></html>

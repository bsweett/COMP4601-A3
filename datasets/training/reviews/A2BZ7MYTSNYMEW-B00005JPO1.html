<meta name="summary" content="No expectations, No disappointments!"></head><body><p>First, I must tell you that as a child I loved the Indy series. They had action, adventure, light romance, and simply tickled the imagination. I also realize that in these times of "special effects", a simple story of action and adventure may not appeal to the masses. Here in lies my dilemma, I liked the series as a child (not to mention several others like Fantasy Island, Love Boat, Knight Rider, Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Murder She Wrote, Remington Steele, Moonlighting, The Goonies, The Gremins, Star Wars, and other 80S, 90s TV shows and movies...I could go on and on and on, but you get my drift) and therefore knew, when compared to what sells today, this would be a hard sale. A continuation of a much loved story, with an older star and special effects to an old theme. Compared to Matrix and the recent Star Wars movies, this seemed to be not as exciting, but for those who love the traditional action adventure movies, they will be able to watch it and have no other expectations but to be entertained. While I do not think this is the best Indy ever, I wasn't as disappointed as other reviewers seem to be.<br /><br />Now the review, which will be short and sweet. Indiana Jones (Professor by day, Adventurer by night) is still an adventurer who is able to use a whip better than those half his age. Captured by those "dastardly Nazi's" who are searching for the remains of an alien, who crashed in New Mexico, Indy must find the crystal skull which will lead to the Kindgom of the Crystal Skull and the City of Gold. Of course during his search, he encounters more Nazi's (including Kate Blanchett who sports a mean bob), double agents, old friends, old loves, a possible son, is the victim of nuclear testing, aliens and so much more. So, with all that said, I give this latest Indy adventure a "3". I wouldn't purchase it, but as a rental on a Sunday, with nothing else to do, I would give it a whirl.</p></body></html>

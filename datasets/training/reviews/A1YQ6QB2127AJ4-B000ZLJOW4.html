<meta name="summary" content="Full of sarcastic humor"></head><body><p>&quot;Ghost World&quot; is not a horror movie like the title suggests.  Rather, it's a comedy for all ages to enjoy.  Some may call it a teen comedy, some may call it an adult comedy, but none will call it an ordinary comedy.  None will forget its sarcastic lines and cruel humor.  However, some scenes become serious and inspirational, giving the audiences the realisms of the characters' behaviors.  This proves the cruel humor voiced by the characters, not the writers.  The writers combine everything wonderfully and uniquely.<p>Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi act her characters delightfully, receiving Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor.  Their chemistry perfects their roles as a critical teaser and an unpopular man.  She joking acts as the blonde from his newspaper ad, therefore standing him up on a date.  Unexpectedly, they meet days later in his record selling sale.  She buys one and soon becomes influenced by more than the music.  The scenes beyond this gives Thora Birch's character more conflict and backlash against all of her other aquaintances, especially her best friend.  All other character, major or minor, are unforgettably funny, making the movie incomplete without them.  Many unexpected events occur, leaving the audience anxious for the next scene.  Those who like &quot;Ghost World&quot; should buy the DVD.  It will be a classic years from now.<p>***Note: There is a scene after the credits so don't push &quot;stop&quot; quickly.</p></body></html>

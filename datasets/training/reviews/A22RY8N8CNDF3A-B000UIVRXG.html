<meta name="summary" content="Comedy or Horror Show?"></head><body><p>This 2007 British movie totally confused me.  It starts out slow and sets up a situation that is supposed to be funny.  Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is the star.  He acts and looks like the latest James Bond actor, a combination of Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood.  Nicolas Angel is an over-achiever cop in London.  His fellow cops are embarrassed by his perfection as it makes them look bad.  His arrest record is 400% higher than any of them.  He makes them all look bad, like they are not trying to do their jobs.  Angel's supervisors send him to a small remote village outside of London.  The name of the town is Sandford and Angel starts out doing trite and routine police work.  The feel of the movie is that it is a dry comedy, but you begin to wonder as Angel's crime sensing skills keep jolting you.  At first it is small crimes.<br /><br />He becomes partners with Danny (Nick Frost), the son of the the Police Chief, Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent).  Danny is a wanna-be gunfighter, action-oriented guy, and becomes fast friends with Angel.<br /><br />The story unravels from being fairly pleasant and tongue-in-cheek funny to a horrifying realization that practically the whole town is involved with murders, violence and sociopathic behaviors.  The blood and guts is not that funny and shocked and gagged me.  Many killings that were set up to look accidental were really murders planned by the town's "Better Good" shadow committee.<br /><br />As the mystery deepens, and grisly deaths continue through scene after scene, Angel and Nick work together to clean up the town - it morphs into a Western of sorts when Angel rides into town on a horse with enough guns to kill a platoon.  Some of the dark comedy gave me a laugh, but the last part of the movie dragged on and on, as one fight after another erupts, deaths mount and everyone that can double-cross another has had their scene.  It is supposed to be surprising but it only made me look at my watch - when is this overwrought fairy-tale hero going to win and move on?  He finally does, the town settles down, and it is a relief.<br /><br />If you like a lot of gun-totting frumpy villagers, car chases, bombs, back-stabbing, and grisly scenes this is for you.</p></body></html>

However unlike a lot of romantic comedies it doesn't leave me wanting to throw-up in a bucket. Bill Murray plays Phil Conners a TV Weatherman man destined to re-live the same day over and over, and from the way it is depicted in the film, this happens literally thousands of times. Sent to cover the Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney the very cynical Phil can't believe it when he wakes the next morning to find its Groundhog Day again.....<br /><br />Many of the characters will live on with you after you have seen the film. Perhaps best of all is Ned Ryerson (brilliantly played by Stephen Tobolowsky) who Phil Conners meets every day over and over. He was someone Phil new at school, but now he's the Insurance salesman from hell. This a very funny film, I saw it at the Cinema two or three times and have enjoyed it every time since. There hasn't been a better comedy since it was made. For that matter I can't think of many better before it was made.<br /><br />The supporting cast are all good, and the extras on the DVD include a directors commentary, documentary as well as the usual trailers etc.</p></body></html>

This difference must however remain a surprise, therefore I simply can not elaborate, to avoid the spoilers.<br /><br />The one thing probably everybody already knows is that this is a film about a group of people stranded in northern Alaska in the middle of nowhere, during a winter harsh even by local standards. The way they arrive to the place of departure of their ordeal is VERY well described! The group counts initially eight members - but without providing any real spoilers, I can say that of course not all will make it until the final credits. Another thing I can reveal is that guessing the exact identity of all those who will survive is not an easy task - I for one completely failed...<br /><br />Another thing probably known to anybody interested in this film, is that some wolves are involved. Here, the only thing that I can say, is that this film avoids both typical "wolf movie" wolf traps. First, there is absolutely NO fantastic elements - the wolves are simply a bunch of very pragmatic and down to earth (or rather snow) hungry fellows, who just happen to be well skilled in their trade... Second, there is no New Age/ecologist wolf worshipping - wolves are animals with all the wonderful and nasty things that it implies. And wolves will be wolves. Period.<br /><br />Alaskan winter wilderness is shown in an incredible way, in its full majestic, cruel and merciless beauty. Visually, this film is breathtaking and for that reason I advise to buy it in Blu-Ray rather than in classical DVD, as here every pixel counts.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is GREAT! There is simply no other way to describe his performance. His character is very believable and I found it really likeable. Without revealing too much I can also say that I felt for him a lot, as he is a man in lots of pain, from the beginning of film, as it is shown in the two first minutes - and nothing more will be said...<br /><br />Other characters are also rather well developped and actors play them well. Most of actors were completely unknown to me, with the exception of Dermot Mulroney, who clearly went a long way since his beginnings in romantic comedies in the 90s...<br /><br />You should not expect any "Rambo" or other "Great White Hunter" moments. The film is very realistic and all the "heroes" are just ordinary people, who found themselves in a very extraordinary situation. They begin their trek for survival already under big shock and are most of the time very tired, very cold and very very scared - and that means that they make mistakes, which people comfortably sitting in a warm cinema and having all the time of reflexion they want, would probably avoid... I found this vulnerability of all the characters, including the one who is in principle the most skilled in survival, a very realistic touch.<br /><br />But the thing that is the most impressive is the study of the approach of those people to their very possible future death. In the immediate proximity of death people start to see the world differently and understand things which remained for them a mystery previously. Now, there is no preaching in this film - here, there is no better or worse way to deal with the sound of approaching steps of the Grim (or here rather Grey) Reaper. But there are many different ways. And as far as I am concerned, that was for me the main point of "The Grey" - how scared, exhausted and suffering people face the high probability of a horrible death, when in the same time struggling with all their forces to live another day.<br /><br />Bottom line, I found this film a very excellent thing, I spend a very good cinema moment and I am going to buy the Blu-Ray as soon as it is available.</p></body></html>

This film dispels both of those commonplaces, and really is one of those films that a fan like me waits for, if only to remind myself why I go to the theatres.<br /><br />To set-up a basic introduction, first you need to know that this takes place sometime in the future, in the United Kingdom.  The world is very different, as the US is said to be in turmoil, while Great Britain indeed looks very powerful and strong.  Or so says their media, because in the movie's not too distant past Britain was controlled (through elections) by Sullivan (played by John Hurt) who is as much a 1984 Big Brother, as he is a president.  This is why we meet the 'terrorist' V, and Portman's character Evey, who together have both in their own way suffered under Sutler.<br /><br />Enough plot summary though, as I assure you that this movie will be worth your while.  Because once again, this film is smart and action-packed (thanks Wachowski brothers!); this is indeed too often becoming a rarity.  One more positive note, is that even though the situation is foreign (and not just by nationality), there is some commonality for all to relate to and dig into.  So, what can I say, except see it, like it, love it.<br /><br />I hope you do.</p></body></html>

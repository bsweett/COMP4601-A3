<meta name="summary" content="Monster Seeking Monsters"></head><body><p>Hellboy, when it was first announced as a film project, shocked me because I kept trying to figure out how it was going to be made.  First I pondered the budget necessary to make a film version of Mike Migola's insanely cool comic without making it look stupid and cheap.  Second I worried greatly about the director.  Last, I couldn't even begin to think about who the hell would play Hellboy.<br /><br />Amazing as it seems, the budget was more than adequate, the director more than capable (Guillermo del Toro), and the actor playing Hellboy (Ron Perlman) was, is, and always will be the film incarnation of the big red guy.  In fact, if I had my way I'd nominate Perlman for an Academy Award (and in doing so validate those frivolities very existence).  Betcha it don't happen though.<br /><br />This film is the grandest presentation of a fanboy project since The Fellowship of the Ring, made all the more amazing by the fact that the source material is a borderline underground comic.  Del Toro's genius is in proving that great film making can come from the semi-obscure.<br /><br />Every shot with Hellboy is eyecatching, and with the special effects teams involved it's no wonder.  From creature animation, to backgrounds the best of the best had there hand in this film.<br /><br />While Hellboy is bad ass, Abe Sapien is perhaps one of the most beautiful creature creations brought to film ever, kind of like the Creature from the Black Lagoon with a yen for book learning instead of white bikinis.  Liz, is a Firestarter that would roast Drew Barrymore like some leftover cocktail weenie.<br /><br />Throw in a tick tock man made of gears and cogs who was a nazi super assassin, the mad monk Rasputin, and several demon/gods from hell and you've got an action/horror hybrid that's enough to put any SFX junkie into joy riddled convulsions.<br /><br />The best part about this movie (aside from the reported sequel in the works) is that it increased the world's knowledge exponentially of the wonderful comic by Mike Mignola.  People are now seeking out the haunting artwork and surreal storytelling of Hellboy and I envy anyone their first glance into Mignola's imagination.<br /><br />Now for one last thing, apparently a director's cut is on the way, and while on the one hand I feel cheated, I also find myself curious.  I'm having a psychic moment, it involves the future and a willfull relinquishing of hard earned funds.  Hopefully it will be worth it.  I know the original theatrical release was.  One of the top 10 movies of 2004.</p></body></html>

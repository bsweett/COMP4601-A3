<meta name="summary" content="The Only Person That's Held "Hostage" Is The Viewer"></head><body><p>Bruce Willis continues his career slump with this mutated, watered down version of "Die Hard", with Willis in the Al Powell role, minus the twinkies.<br /><br />Willis (with a full head of hair and beard) is Jeff Talley a top notch hostage negotaiter who has one very bad day. Fast forward to a year later and Talley (now clean shaven and bald) is the Chief of Police of Anysmalltown, CA, where life for him & his family has slowed to a crawl.<br /><br />Talley's past is about to return to haunt him as three young teenagers follow a wealthy family home and try to steal the family Escalade for a joyride. When the three boys set off the silent alarm, the cops come calling, forcing the boys to hold the family hostage. After Talley lets the higher ups take command, Talley calls it a day and heads for home.<br /><br />Things change tragically when Talley gets held up by a masked man, informing Talley that their is a secret DVD disc inside the rich family's house and that if he doesn't return to the house and get the disc, Talley's family will die along with the rich family.<br /><br />It's up to John MacL - er, Jeff Talley to save his family and the day.<br /><br />"Hostage" is definitely one of those films that should be caught on "HBO" or "STARZ" , & thats only if there isn't anything else on.<br /><br />The problem with "Hostage" is that you can actually see the plotpoints from "Die Hard", right down to one of the teenage boys trying to channel the menace of Hannibal Lecter with "Die Hard"'s uber trash terrorist Hans Gruber(it doesn't work & the kid sucks).<br /><br />The acting is terrible. Willis seems to be in first gear & doesn't really take off, like he did in "Die Hard". Willis' real life daughter plays Talley's daughter in this film & comes across as a whiner (she has a few lines but nothing earthshattering). Kevin Pollock, who is usually funny, looks like he just showed up for his paycheck. The daughter of the rich family is pain in the a.s.s. The film is a bore.<br /><br />"Hostage" opened a couple of weeks ago in theaters & will most likely crash land on DVD near the end of June '05.</p></body></html>

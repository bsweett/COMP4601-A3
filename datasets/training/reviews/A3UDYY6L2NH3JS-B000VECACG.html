The intervention of extraterrestrials in our society starts a real panic among many people, and at the same type mesmerizes some who are invited in a way for the grand coming that is announced by this open show of power and benevolence. Then the film analyzes the reaction of authorities. Military authorities are obsessed by limiting the contact of these ETs with the population, hence they evacuate the area where the meeting is supposed to take place, they establish a whole fear and even fright process to convince the population that they must go away or stay away,and they constantly think of danger, instead of thinking of potential opening. On the other side the scientists, strangely dominated by a Frenchman, are jumping on the occasion to open their minds, to seize the day, the night and the new vistas that open up to them. <p>The capture of a child gives a tremendous sentimental and affective dimension to these contacts, because he does not know fear and only sees what it is for him : a contact with a new toyland, with new playmates. The whole deal is to surrender all the men the ETs have captured over the previous decades, and the equipment with which they had been captured, such as planes and boats, in exchange for a new batch of volunteers to go with them for exhanges and a visit to this extraterrestrial world. The suspense in the film is created by a man who was visited a couple of nights before on the road and who manages to go through all barriers and to impose himself on the trip, with the complicity of the Frenchman. <p>What is admirable in this film is that the ETs are shown as absolutely mature and our society, at a scientific level, as being ready to experiment, to take risks, to engulf in an adventure. It is a very positive approach to the problem and this is refreshing. Steven Spielberg manages to literally mesmerize us by organizing a real ballet of light and colors and music as the way these ETs can communicate with us (music and colored lights) and can demonstrate they power as well as their total un-agressiveness (the ballet of lights and beautiful movements  in the sky). He also evades the necessity to show the ETs by blurring their rather childish forms in a nearly blinding light. They are only shadows in this light, and this keeps some kind of mystery in the encounters.<p>This film is refreshing, optimistic and the perfect counterbalancing vision as opposed to the totally urban paranoid approach of many authors, the latest book on the subject being Steven King's Dreamcatcher. Here we understand we must not be afraid of them or their coming, because, and definitely more than us, they want to know, to exchange, to build together with us rather than destroy and annihilate.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.</p></body></html>

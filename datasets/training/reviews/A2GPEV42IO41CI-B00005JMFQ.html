<meta name="summary" content="Very adult comedy about Love"></head><body><p>Love Actually is a sparkling Christmas comedy about eight couples and the love in their lives.  Hugh Grant stars as the newly-elected British Prime Minister, who falls in love with his unsophisticated secretary.  The wonderful Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman play a bored couple whose marriage is on the rocks.  Handsome Colin Firth plays a writer working in France who is attracted to his Portuguese assistant, who doesn't speak English.  Bill Nighy nearly steals the show as an outrageously flamboyant  middle-aged ex-rock star who has a new hit.<br /><br />All of the actors are excellent in their roles.  Hugh Grant is my favorite, playing his usual, adorable, Prince Charming role to perfection.  Thompson and Rickman are compelling as spouses who have lost the spark, at least for each other.  The script is solidly funny, and poignant as well. (Note:  Bring your hankie.)<br /><br />The film would have been better if it had concentrated on just  three couples.  One of the unnecessary stories deals with a couple in the porn business, and there is a great deal of nudity.  For this reason, I think the film should be rated NC-17.  But it is a real feel-good movie and a genuinely funny comedy that will leave you smiling through your tears.</p></body></html>

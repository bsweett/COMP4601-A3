His successful efforts are numerous, some even garnering Academy Awards in varying fields, he's managed to launch many actors and actresses from Hollywood's B-list straight to the top of the A-list, and also launched many of Tinseltown's most lucrative film franchises.  From "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" to "E.T.:  The Extra-Terrestrial", from "Jaws" to the `Indiana Jones' trilogy, all the way up to "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World:  Jurassic Park", Spielberg is a movie-making force to be reckoned with.  With all of these hits under his belt, every once in a while he still suffers the occasional clunker, such as 2001's very expensive "A.I.:  Artificial Intelligence".  Audiences were disappointed with this film, and some wondered if Spielberg really had what it takes from a director to craft a successful futuristic sci-fi thriller.  In response to the public's doubts, Spielberg returned to the realm of sci-fi in 2003 with the smash-hit "Minority Report", successfully laying to rest any doubts and fears movie audiences may have had regarding the veteran director's talents.<br /><br />"Minority Report" takes place in the not-so distant future in Washington D.C., where for 6 years has been completely murder free thanks in no small part to an awesome technology that identifies a killer before the crime is committed.  However, when the chief of the Precrime Unit (Tom Cruise) comes under investigation for a future murder that will occur within 36 hours, he has to fight against time and his co-workers, led by an over-zealous investigator (Colin Farrell), to prove his innocence or fall victim to the seemingly "perfect" justice system he helped to create.<br /><br />With outstanding special effects (rumored at first, to have been taken directly from "A.I.:  Artificial Intelligence", the rumor was later debunked), gripping performances from the entire cast, and once again excellent direction from a critically acclaimed director, it's not surprising that "Minority Report" enjoyed great success at the box office and on DVD.  Roger Ebert summed up the movie best when he said, "It reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place."  I couldn't agree more with Hollywood's portly movie critic, "Minority Report" is one of those few science fiction movies that not only entertains with outstanding special effects, but the story actually makes you ponder certain ideas and notions; such as, is someone truly guilty of a crime they have yet to commit or is there a chance that maybe they intended to commit a crime, but may have not gone through with it, therefore making them innocent?  If that's the case wouldn't arresting that person on intent alone be unjust or merely stopping the inevitable evil that will occur at some point in that person's future life?  Who knows, but it sure makes one think, which is what all movies should aspire to, and what all good movies actually accomplish.<br /><br />This is definitely not a movie to be missed, and should definitely be watched by any sci-fi fan, and if you are a fan of Steven Spielberg but was somewhat disappointed by "A.I.:  Artificial Intelligence", then "Minority Report" is the movie to see, as it will help you to completely forget about that previous failure of Spielberg's.<br /><br />"Minority Report" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wow.  Brendan Fraser as an Indiana Jones stereotype....Works for me..."></head><body><p>Recipe:  The Mummy<br /><br />Ingredients:  Brendan Frasier, Rachel Wiesz, Stephen Sommers, decaying mummy, bugs, comedy, adventure, and just a dash of horror.<br /><br />End Result:  5 star movie.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much from this, I was actually expecting it to be more of a horror story, but its basically an action-adventure.  Some might not like that, but I do.  It brought back memories of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery, of course thats what it meant to do.  I loved the dialoge.  It was funny and a bit cheesy, but again thats how this was supposed to be.<br /><br />The effects are great for a 99' movie.  The mummy looked completely realistic.  The acting was great, especially from Fraser.<br /><br />Overall if you want a comedy movie get this.  If you want an action movie, get this.  If you want to have a great time at The Movies, get this...</p></body></html>

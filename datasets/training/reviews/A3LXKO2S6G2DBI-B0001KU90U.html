If the "I haven't figured out the right dose of Ritalin to take yet" presence of Tom Cruise grates on your nerves as much as it does mine, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that he at times gives a measured and even subtle performance as a shell-shocked cavalry officer prostituting himself to teach the Japanese military the brutally efficient techniques of Western warfare.  His supporting cast of talented Asian actors is better, though even Ken Watanabe, who at times resembles Lawrence Fishburne in expression and intensity, is no Toshiro Mifune.  Where the movie breaks down is with John Logan's shallow script, which like most Western films about the East, implies complexity mostly by making Asians esoteric and tight-lipped; but for all of the posturing, there is no real wisdom offered in a story meant to explore culture clash.  Instead, viewers are distracted by battle scenes that probably would have seemed grand had the aforementioned films (with corrected titles), as well as "Gladiator" and "The Last of the Mohicans," not beaten this one to the punch.  Zwick even plagiarizes his own film, the much better "Glory," and fans of Hans Zimmer's "The Thin Red Line" soundtrack will be pleased to note that some of it seems to make its way into this film.  All in all, "The Last Samurai" isn't a bad film.  With an attractive cast and nods to historical authencity, such as ill-fitting uniforms, it's also not bad to look at, even if some suspiciously modern looking powerlines turn up in one scene.  It's just that we've seen most of it already.</p></body></html>

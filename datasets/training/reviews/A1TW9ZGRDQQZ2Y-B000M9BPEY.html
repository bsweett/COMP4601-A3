<meta name="summary" content="My New Favorite Tim Burton Film!"></head><body><p>Just got back from this movie and let me just say it much better than I thought it would be. And I had high hopes! First of all, the visuals are some of Tim Burton's best to date. The multiple fantasy worlds he has created are some of the most unique ever put to film. The acting is extremely strong, especially Albert Finney(old Edward), Ewan McGregor(young Edward), Danny Devito, Steve Buscemi(very funny role), and even the little known Billy Crudup as Edward's truth seeking son. All the rest of the cast are great as well, but have much smaller roles. Even though this film is full of funny and amusing situations, it is still at heart a serious and moving film. My eyes actually teared up at the end sequence with Albert Finney's character being taken into the river with all his friends watching on. This film will be watched by many for years to come, and some have already called it Burton's masterpiece. While the visuals alone are not impressive enough to top Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands, or even the first two Batman films, it is the Father-Son story that breathes life and warmth into an already beautiful looking film. As the wisest people claim that true beauty is on the inside rather than the outside, is only but a half truth as with some of Edward's stories in this film. Because in this rare instance, Burton has made a film that is imaginative and beautiful inside and out.</p></body></html>

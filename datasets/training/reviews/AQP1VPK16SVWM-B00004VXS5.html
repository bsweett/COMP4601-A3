<meta name="summary" content="Classic  Western will hopefully be re-released on DVD"></head><body><p>While I still find Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time in The West to be his best and most morally complex western  (it's also the only spaghetti western that had footage shot in the United States in Monument Valley a classic John Ford setting), The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is certainly one of his most entertaining and interesting westerns. <p>I'm not going to recap the plot beyond saying that the trio of main characters featured here (well played by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach)form an unholy alliance to recover confederate gold. All three manage to cross and double cross each other and while Eastwood's Man With No Name character may be the "good" of the title, he's by no means the type of hero you would find in a John Ford or Howard Hawks western. <p>The picture looks very nice on this DVD single disc release but (I may have a disc that is flawed) the deleted scenes have no audio. It says it features the original Italian audio but, in fact, the sequences are silent (which would explain why Eastwood and Wallach went back to redub the restored version released this year). When you do hit the audio button on your DVD remote it does say the soundtrack is the Italian version but, again, there's nothing to hear. The sound is so-so and that's not a surprise given that the original soundtrack was in mono and it would be very difficult to locate the original source audio for a digital remix for true 5.1.<p>If you're a fan of the film and can find this at a bargain, by all means pick it up. If not, wait until the restored version that Scorese worked on is released on DVD. Since that will include the 16 minutes of footage missing from the film with redubbed dialog by Eastwood and Wallach, that version would be the must have for fans of the film. I'm hoping that MGM is planning on releasing this fairly soon (much like they did with the restored Escape from New York which which is being released in December of 2003)as a two disc set with all the extras the film deserves. <p>One of the criticisms about the film is that it doesn't capture the true flavor of the old west (don't recall who wrote the review). That's not a surprise given that the film was made by an Italian film director with a love of American westerns. Leone's films are self reflective--by that I mean they are films about other films [...] You only have to watch this film and Once Upon a Time in The West to get this sense; there's references to a number of classic westerns in either film including The [...]other major and minor classic films. <p>Leone was interested in using the American archetypes created by [...] and other American film directors and bringing a sense of irony and cynicism. The films exhibit a European flavor and that's to be expected. Most importantly, Leone helped spark the interest in reviving westerns by American film directors. The western had largely fallen out of favor. Without Leone's trilogy there would have been no High Plains Drifted, The Outlaw Josey Wales or any number of mid-60's westerns.<p>Eastwood later refined Leone's vision with a uniquely American perspective in the classic films High Plains Drifter, The Outlaw Josey Wales and The Unforgiven. This cross pollenation of European art western and American pulp western gave new life to a genre that had played itself out by the early 60's. Every so often a film director comes along to breath new life into a dying genre. Leone just happened to have the artistic ability and creative tenacity to pull it off.</p></body></html>

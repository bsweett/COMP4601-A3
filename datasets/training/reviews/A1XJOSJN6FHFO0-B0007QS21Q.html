<meta name="summary" content="Excellent"></head><body><p>I knew that any movie with Will Smith in it had to be a winner, and I was not disappointed. Set in the future, robots have been given many jobs and are being used to help humans.<br /><br />Will Smith, who plays Detective Spooner, dislikes robots for personal reasons and is not surprised when trouble erupts between humans and robots, after the death of their creator.<br /><br />The movie becomes quite intense as he finds out the robots are planning to take over mankind, for their own good of course!<br /><br />This is a great movie full of suspense and adventure and a really good storyline that holds your interest through the entire movie.  I recommend this one for the entire family.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie, Worth Watching More Than Once."></head><body><p>Regardless of what everyone here thinks, I thought the movie was pretty good. Even though there are movies out there with the similar ideas and plots as this, none of them are really like it. Constantine tells of this exorcist or whatever, trying to buy his way into heaven, later meeting up with this cop searching for answers to what really happened to her identical twin sister Isabel. As the movie goes on, she realizes that the stuff that she and her sister saw when they were little girls were indeed real, both holding psychic powers, which brings in her key part in the movie.<br /><br />Good acting by good actors and pretty nice movie to watch, quite a bit of action but doesn't go overboard but again a good thing because nowadays, younger viewers are all crazy for a lot of explosives etc, which I find now to be a bunch of bs and nothing that makes you think much, guess thats why the average IQ is so low now.<br /><br />Again, everyone should watch this instead of listening to a bunch of reviews of people on the net. I've watched good movies that people say suck and I've watched bad movies that people say are good. Only way to really find out...is to watch it on your own.</p></body></html>

Even if you are tired of Kun-fu movies you should be entertained by this movie. It has the style of an old black and white movie in some ways. It sort of reminded me of a Buster Keaton movie is some ways. I mean by the comedy, not the martial arts of course.<br /><br />  You have a lady with curlers in her hair that can run as fast  as  the road runner and who's main power is her screaming. Also scrawny looking guys who are really great warriors. One of the funniset scenes takes place when  Stephen Chow challenges some town people to a fight. He wants to prove himself worthy to a badass gang. Anyway each person he chooses that look wimpy turn out to be covered in muscles. Even a little kid that he challenges, is ripped. The movie is great fun and good for a laugh even if the final battle is overly silly and not as funny as it could've been.</p></body></html>

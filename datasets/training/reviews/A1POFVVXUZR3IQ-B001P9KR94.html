<meta name="summary" content="A Bollywood fairytale"></head><body><p>"Slumdog Milionaire" is definitely a feel-good movie - from early on,young Jamal [Dev Patel] wins our hearts as he desperately tries to find his childhood sweetheart Latika [Freida Pinto] by entering the Indian version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" Incredulous and sceptical of Jamal's intelligence [after all, Jamal is a 'slumdog'], the show's host [Anil Kapoor] gets him carted off by the police for interrogation. Faced by the cynical inspector [Irfan Khan of "Namesake"], Jamal proceeds to convince the policeman of his innocence by recounting his childhood experiences till the present that accounts for his almost miraculous run of good luck on the show.<br /><br />I loved the child actors in this show - the ones who played Jamal, his brother Salim and Latika as children were absolutely incredible and wholly credible as street children struggling to survive, falling prey to the most predatory and repugnant of criminals, those who maim children in order that the kids may 'convincingly' beg on the streets to fill the criminals coffers. One of the most horrifying scenes in this movie is the part where the criminal mastermind watches over the removal of a little boy's eyes.<br /><br />So why only 3 stars you may ask - I liked this movie a lot but I did find that it didn't truly explore the plight of street children which it purportedly aims to portray on-screen. The coverage somehow seems shallow, using the story arc of the child maiming syndicate to shock audiences instead. Perhaps this is due to the fact that I've watched too many Indian movies that deal more convincingly with such themes - "Nayagan" [Tamil, starring Kamal Hasan, a renowned South Indian actor], Thalapathi [Tamil, stars Rajni Kanth], the incomparable Salaam Bombay [1988,Hindi by Mira Nair], and also City of Joy [1992, English, starring Patrick Swayze] all are more credible in showing the plight of street children.<br /><br />"Slumdog Millionaire" on the other hand is a Bollywood fairytale with a predictably happy ending. It makes one feel good, and in a world filled with cruelty and depravity, most of us are happy to see the fulfillment of Jamal's dreams. But reality is very different, and the majority of street children in India will never experience even a fraction of the success that Jamal attains in this movie. Final verdict: excellent and visually stunning escapist fare.</p></body></html>

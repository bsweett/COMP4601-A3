I know nothing of the book, so I don't know if it is accurate or not, nor do I care! The film is well written and funny at times, but it is sad knowing that much of this insanity is so true! It did hold my interest and the acting is fine, so that is a plus. It's worth your time to watch, but I wouldn't buy it. One view will do!....hey I made a rhyme! ain't I clever?........I need a vacation!</p></body></html>

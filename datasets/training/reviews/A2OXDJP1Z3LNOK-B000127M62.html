Do you think Jason ever wandered into town to just get away from it all?  His hockey mask is now considered a throwback so he has the kids cheering for him.  Freddy has all the quippy one-liners and that snazzy hat.  How can you lose with this one?<p>It has everything you would expect!<br />Gratuitous shower scene<br />Girl falls down in woods, then just waits to get killed.<br />Bumbling town sheriff<p>Young whipper-snapper deputy that is all gung-ho<br />New inventive ways to kill and get killed<br />Jason still just walks - you could be a cheetah and he'd still walk and get you.<br />Freddy's make-up is still bad.<br />Yet another culmination on the same pier in Crystal Lake. You would think it would have dry-rotted by now.<p>It is what it is.  Not bad.  Not good.  Fun.</p></body></html>

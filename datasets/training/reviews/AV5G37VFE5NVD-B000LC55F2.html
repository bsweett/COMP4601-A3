Nolan has a history of following up good projects with extraordinary projects (FOLLOWING with MEMENTO, INSOMNIA with BATMAN BEGINS).  As BATMAN BEGINS was an extraordinary project, Nolan was due for a good project.  That's what I was expecting when I saw THE PRESTIGE: a good film.  What I received was far greater than what I expected, because as it turns out, THE PRESTIGE is one of the finest films I have ever seen.<br /><br />Trying to summarize the film would be a futile effort; the plot thickens immensely with each moment.  The plot in its simplest form is as follows: in London at the end of the 19th century, two young rival magicians (played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) compete to become the finest magicians alive.  Bale seems to accomplish this after performing the ultimate magic trick; Jackman becomes obsessed with finding out Bale's secret and besting him.  By the film's end, its beginning is a distant memory, and one may wonder how we, the viewers, arrived at its end at all.<br /><br />That's not to say that watching the film is strenuous, though.  Not at all.  Watching THE PRESTIGE is a thoroughly captivating and ultimately haunting experience.  What I am saying is that with a storyline of such depth, the film could fail miserably in the hands of a lesser director.  Fortunately, Christopher Nolan is an immensely talented director, one who is nearly cemented in my mind as one of the finest directors alive today.  He is a young master of filmmaking.  Every shot, every scene, every performance, every moment in THE PRESTIGE is flawless, and that's thanks in no small part to Nolan.<br /><br />Then there's the sensational cast, headed by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, two very talented actors who here are at the top of their form.  The on-screen rivalry between the two is delicious, and each character is just flawed enough so you never side with either of them for long.  The excellent supporting cast includes the consistently lovable Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, Peter Jackson favorite Andy Serkis, and an unrecognizable David Bowie, as well as Piper Perabo, who has very little screentime.  Surprisingly, Scarlett Johansson feels almost as though she's wasted and possibly being typecast in the role of "flaming temptress" (see also MATCH POINT).<br /><br />David Julyan's score is very subtle, but its subtlety actually works extremely well, especially when combined with Wally Pfister's typically murky cinematography.  Lee Smith, who also edited BATMAN BEGINS, has done a similarly fast-paced editing job.  The pace could, at times, throw people off.  At the beginning of the film, I was virtually clueless about what was happening.  Advice to those planning on seeing the film: sit it through and enjoy the ride.  It'll all sort itself out by the end.<br /><br />A film like THE PRESTIGE could wind up like a failed magic trick: interesting, perhaps, but ultimately silly and a waste of time.  THE PRESTIGE, however, is every bit as astounding as the "ultimate magic trick" performed within the film.  It's a stellar effort from everyone involved.  The film itself is the most delightful of cinematic magic tricks, the rare film that not only surpasses your expectations, but leaves you speechless.  Personally, I'm surprised that the film hasn't received overwhelmingly positive reviews; in fact, many have even been rather negative.  Maybe with all the cliched dramas and horror remakes that have emerged recently, film audiences are losing their ability to handle a well-made film, even if it is as complex as THE PRESTIGE.  Don't let its complexity put you off from seeing it, though: THE PRESTIGE is not only one of the finest films of the year, it's very probably one of the finest films I've ever seen.</p></body></html>

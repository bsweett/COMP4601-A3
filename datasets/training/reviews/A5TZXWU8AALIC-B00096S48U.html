<meta name="summary" content="One Big, Giant "HUH?""></head><body><p>The first film, THE OMEN, is one of my all-time favorite movies, but the sequels go from watchable (DAMIEN: OMEN II) to downright baffling.<br /><br />By the time we get to this film, THE FINAL CONFLICT, it appears that the filmmakers have completely lost touch with their source material and have no idea what they're doing.<br /><br />Did any of them bother looking at the Book of Revelations?<br /><br />I understand budget restraints and such, but how can you literally change biblical prophecy to fit their lame story?<br /><br />The people who saw the original film and were filled with dread understood the coming evil embodied in the demonic child.<br /><br />By the time they get to THE FINAL CONFLICT, they've got to be scratching their heads.<br /><br />The Second Coming of Christ is going to be a tad bit more cataclysmic than featured here.<br /><br />And the fate of the Antichrist is completely baffling.<br /><br />THE FINAL CONFLICT is like making a movie about Adolph Hitler and he's assassinated in 1936.<br /><br />Think about it.</p></body></html>

A young audience will for the most part find this to be silly, irrelevent and unrelated to where they are at the present time in life, while the older, fifty-five plus viewer (like myself) will view this as a wake-up call and cause one to re-evaluate what one deems important and worthwhile. This film is truly a reflection of real life, the young unconcerned with the inevitable and the questions it posits, the aging begrudgingly accepting and learning to deal with the allotment of time remaining.<br /><br />Yes this is a film designed to draw a specific audience and stars two of Hollywood's most respected senior actors to attract that target group. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are superb and play off each others strengths magnificently. If you're looking for something a little bittersweet and thoughtful populated with some of the most breathtaking scenic landscapes on the planet why not give this one a try. Who knows, it might just inspire you to compose your own bucket list.</p></body></html>

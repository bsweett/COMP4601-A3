<meta name="summary" content="1 STAR> NOT THE MOVIE,FOR  THE DVD RELEASE!"></head><body><p>Loved the first one, And like this squeal too ...Great action pack vampire movie. Is kind of like "blade" but whole lot better action with great sense. But this time NOT going be "foo" again and buy this DVD like I did with first one when released. Then after few months they came out with UNCUT version. Had to buy that one again!!  This time I am not going to be a  foo and double dip us like they did. If u DVD collector like I am wait!!...FOR SURE  gonna be  another UNCUT version in process soon enough!!!  Like most of the DVDs releases these days...tired of double dipping. I don't buy  DVDS like used to be,just rent more! Because of these studio's re-releases  B.S!!!!</p></body></html>

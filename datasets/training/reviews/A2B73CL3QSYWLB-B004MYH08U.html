<meta name="summary" content="Does Anybody Remember Bill Cosby's "The Brown Hornet"?"></head><body><p>My only recollection of the TV version of "The Green Hornet" is when they did a guest appearance on "Batman".  Robin(Burt Ward) fought Kato(Bruce Lee) to a draw(?!).  Kipnapped heiress Pinky Pinkston left an SOS for the Dynamic Duo in her alphabet soup.  The guest villain was the incomparable Roger C. Carmel as Colonel Gumm.  What does all this have to do with the price of tea in China?  Absolutely nothing but I figured I'd write some totally superfluous and extraneous remarks for the Hornet haters who'll get all over me for loving this movie.  I never read the comic books or saw the Tv series so I accept this movie for what it is and it's a total blast.  Star/writer/producer Seth Rogen took a character that is sacrosanct to many and fashioned it to fit his devil-may-care persona purists be damned.  The nocturnal adventures of the Hornet and Kato come off more as a fraternity pledge prank than as some altruistic endeavor and I thought that was a hoot.  What would Kevin Smith think?  Rogen is aces in my book but the real find is Jay Chou as Kato. Chou's Kato has a real alliance with the Hornet instead of just riding shotgun and displaying his karate moves.  Christoph Waltz extends his street cred that he established in "Inglourious Basterds" as the head of the Russian mob and he's as equally chilling and funny as he was in that movie.  James Franco has a terrific cameo as Waltz's "competition".  And how can you forget the cool cars and stunt work.  I love that Rogen took the material not too seriously but just serious enough.</p></body></html>

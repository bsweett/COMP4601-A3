This,however proves to be his undoing as Sophie and Eisenheim are not strangers to each other and they begin to rekindle a long lost romance.Chief Inspector Ull,(Giamatti) is drawn into the plot when the Prince,on hearing of their deception,orders him to charge Eisenheim with fraud.What follows is a tale of love and intrigue,tightly bound by the power of illusion.The illusionist is a well told story with clever use of imagery which consumes the viewer.The acting is of high quality with particularly strong performances from Norton and Giammati.This movie captures the imagination.</p></body></html>

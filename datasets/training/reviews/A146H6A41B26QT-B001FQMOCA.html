<meta name="summary" content="Witherspoon is great!"></head><body><p>Now I see why Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar. The story of Johnny Cash is in some ways a typical one-abusive father, beaten down child, escapes into the music world, tries to be a family man but the rigors of the road lead him into drugs and alcohol. Typical but for Cash's incredible luck in having run into June Carter, who, with her family, forces him to get off the pills. Witherspoon in this movie goes from being the silly, cute "Legally Blond"  type to becoming the most loyal of friends, but tough too. Apparently both Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing-Witherspoon is no singer, and I thought her first number was just a poor dubbing job, but this didn't ruin it for me for a second. If you don't like country music you'll find this drags in spots, but overall it's an engrossing story.</p></body></html>

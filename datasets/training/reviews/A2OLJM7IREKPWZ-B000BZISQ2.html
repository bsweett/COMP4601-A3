Arnold does great at playing a relentless, soldier if you will to protect Conner. I would of liked to have Furlong play the grown up version of Conner but Nick Stahl works just as well. he reproduces the way John Conner is like in T2. curious, smart ass mouth talker, dangerous, and smart all in one. I like that he can reuse what Conner has even if someone else plays his role. Kristanna Loken is sexy and scary as her role. she's the perfect female terminatrix as they call her somewhere in the movie or story. I can't wait to see the other movies she was in before this or after this movie. the whole cast is brilliant. Johnathen Mostow is just as innovative as James Cameron is with his first 2 Terminator movies. he adds just as much shock, comedy etc as Cameron did. both directors should be proud of themselves. wether Cameron would of made this or Mostow. I still would of seen it. all directors deserve a chance when they create something. so glad I got this on dvd. the Sgt. Candy scene is hilarious. and you really learn alot on disc 2 about the special effects, etc. quite a great movie. saw it 1 time in theatre. and 5 times on dvd. it will be seen more times played in my dvd player when I can watch it. rest assured people</p></body></html>

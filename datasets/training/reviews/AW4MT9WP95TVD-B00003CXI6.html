<meta name="summary" content="Great low key thriller"></head><body><p>Hitchcock comparisons aside, this is one tidy ghost story.<br /><br />Minimal gore and violence, some self-depracating humor, and losts of creepy, eerie moments make this one a winner.  Atmosphere is key here and the stunning lake house they built for this film is gorgeous.  Tranquil, beautiful. peaceful and just the right set-up to concince us it's all paranoia.<br /><br />Pfeiffer is absolutely excellent here and carries the film squarely on her shoulders.  If we don't believe her, the whole film goes out the window.  Her performance ranks among her best and she did deserve an Oscar nod for it.  Her expression change when she is momentarily "possessed" and the sees the house door open reflected in a mirror is alone worth a viewing of this quasi old fashioned chiller.<br /><br />A good fun ride, some nice chills, and Pfeiffer's perfomance make this the winner it is,</p></body></html>

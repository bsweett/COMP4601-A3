<meta name="summary" content="Quirky, outlandish love story"></head><body><p>The brilliant, creative mind of writer Charlie Kaufman and the able direction of Michel Gondry guided an all star cast in a totally unique type of romantic dramatic comedy.<br /><br />Jim Carey, again proves his versatility in portraying Joel Barish, a shy introverted guy who falls for a flaky extroverted gal Clementine who he meets on the beach in Montauk.  Kate Winslet does a terrific job playing the often times out of control wacko Clementine, who appears to be the diametric opposite of Barish.<br /><br />The fun starts when Winslet, tiring of their rocky relationship undergoes an experimental procedure to totally erase Carey from her memory.  Carey freaks out and in spite also seeks out Dr. Mierzwiak, the inventor of this technology, well played by veteran actor Tom Wilkinson.  He desires to have Winslet also purged from his memory.  During the procedure, Carey gets second thoughts and while bit by bit of his memory is being erased, he starts changing his mind about doing it.  Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo are hysterical as Dr. M's technical associates. While reliving memories about to be expunged, Carey decides that he deeply cares for Winslet.<br /><br />"Eternal Sunshine" was an exhilirating movie experience.  I particularly enjoy the effect of having Carey's character come out from behind the camera to observe the plot of the movie within the movie.  This appears to be a staple of Kaufman plots as in his also fabulous flick "Adaptation"</p></body></html>

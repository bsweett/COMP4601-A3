<meta name="summary" content="A visceral and bloody mind trip"></head><body><p>Tracy Letts adapted her off Broadway play with Bug, directed by the legendary William Friedkin (The Exorcist, The French Connection), and in his hands, Bug is a visceral and bloody mind trip that is sadly underrated.  Ashley Judd stars as a white trash waitress with a shattered past who is dreading the return of her ex-con husband (Harry Connick Jr.) and holds up in a cheap motel.  Soon enough, she meets a scarred Gulf War vet (Michael Shannon), and afterwards, he discovers a bug in her bed.  What happens next is a bizarre and often compelling mind trip that turns quite bloody as the ever growing paranoia escalates into territory you'll never see coming.  Without giving too much away, Bug is a twisting examination of mental illness that is made only better by the performances from Judd and Shannon.  Shannon (reprising his stage role) in particular is spectacular, and should become more well known thanks to his performance here, but alas, Bug has gotten a bad rep thanks to some sloppy marketing.  It's no secret that Bug isn't what you may think it is (I wouldn't classify this film as horror really) and that it's definitely not for all tastes, but make no mistake that Bug leaves a lasting impression.  All in all, if you're looking for something a little different and quite compelling in your viewing experience, you could do far worse than Bug.</p></body></html>

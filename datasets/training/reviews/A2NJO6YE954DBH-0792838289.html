<meta name="summary" content="The classic political thriller still delivers the goods"></head><body><p>"The Manchurian Candidate" was a legendary film when I was growing up. You have to remember that way back then, before cable television and video cassette players, that it was rather difficult to see many of the classic films. I caught "Gone With the Wind" when it was in what proved to be its last theatrical release, stumbled upon "Seven Samurai" on PBS one night, and say "Citizen Kane," "Frankenstein," "The Philadelphia Story," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "Dr. Strangelove," and other classics when they managed to make their way to local art or revival theaters. But back then there were two movies we knew we were not going to get to see, the Marx Brothers comedy "Animal Crackers" and John Frankenheimer's "The Manchurian Candidate." The former was tied up in some legal entanglement but with the latter the story was always that Frank Sinatra, not only the star but person who owned a controlling interest of the 1962 film, pulled it from release after the assassination of John F. Kennedy until 1988.  However, it appears that the film was shown on television in 1965, 1974 and 1975 (I must have missed it), and then when it was pulled by Sinatra is was because the thought United Artist was cooking the books.  Oh, well.  It was a nice story for all those years and you know the rule about legends turning into truth.<br /><br />Few films from that period hold up as well today as does "The Manchurian Candidate."  The story, adapted from Richard Condon's novel by George Axelrod, is complicated enough that a narrator shows up for a few of the early scenes to help us along.  In Korea in 1952 an American patrol is betrayed by their Korean scout and captured by the Communists.  They then return to the United States as heroes, with Sergeant Raymond Shaw being awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.  He is the step-son of Republican Senator John Yerkes Iselin (James Gregory), a Joseph McCarthy like figure whose brains are all in the head of his wife (Angela Lansbury), Raymond's ruthless mother.  But then we find that the leader of the patrol, Captain and now Major Bennett Marco (Sinatra) is having the same nightmare every night, and we have one of the three classic examples of montage in American cinema (along with the shower scene in "Psycho" and the baptism montage in "The Godfather").<br /><br />Marco dreams that he and the patrol are sitting on a stage attending a garden show in New Jersey.  A woman is going on and on about hydrangeas as the camera does a 360 degree pan, but by the time the camera swings back around to its original position the stage is a auditorium in Manchurian and the women on the stage are now communist soldiers.  The scene was shot in six different ways, mixing the two stages, the two audiences, and the two speakers.  As edited by Ferris Webster it seems as if virtually every cut is from one mix to a different one.  The end result is a powerful montage that captures perfectly the unreal sense of what is going on.  It is also a wonderful way of getting a lot of exposition into the scene and if you want a sign of how good this film is then consider how much exposition is worked into various scenes without you noticing that they are going on and on about the big bad plot and such.<br /><br />There are several other nice sequences as well, although nothing could top that particular tour de force.  When a black member of the patrol "continues" Marko's dream the women are now all black instead of white.  Then there is the scene of the press conference for the Secretary of Defense interrupted by Senator Iselin where we see it happening and on television at the same time.  Notice also how Frankenheimer balances these sorts of scenes with those that are done in longer takes usually two shots.  There is more style to "The Manchurian Candidate" than just its most famous scene.<br /><br />Ironically, the biggest probably with believability in "The Manchurian Candidate" is not that Chinese communists could come up with this plot to put their agent in the White House but that Eugnie Rose Chaney (Janet Leigh), would run into Marco on a train, see this shaking wreck of a man, and decide to give him her name, address, phone number, and dump her fiance.  I suppose it was seen as some sort of a red herring, because otherwise you have to wonder what is wrong with that girl?<br /><br />Sinatra considered this his finest performance and I am inclined to agree with his self-assessment, but the same can be said for both Harvey and Lansbury.  Sinatra wanted Lucille Ball to play the Queen of Diamonds, but it is impossible to think of anybody other than Lansbury doing this role and the scene in which she speaks to Raymond, kisses him, and sends him off to fulfill his mission is one of the most chilling in cinema history.  Lansbury and Webster were the only two Oscar nominees from the cast, which is surprising in itself given the film's reputation, but they lost to Patty Duke for "The Miracle Worker" and Anne V. Coates for "Lawrence of Arabia," a pair of votes that are certainly understandable.<br /><br />The DVD extras on this special edition of "The Manchurian Candidate" are definitely spartan.  There is a brief conversation with Frankenheimer, Axlerod and Sinatra, and the director provides some commentary on a special track.  My guess is that Frankenheimer talks for maybe half the film at best, but what he does have to say is worth listening to for the inside details on how some of the scenes got shot, production problems, what came from the original novel versus the script, and other fun bits of information.  With the remake of "The Manchurian Candidate" this summer there should be a renewed interest in the original, which will only serve to reaffirm its deserved reputation in the history of American cinema (#67 on the American Film Institute's list of top 100 movies of all-time).</p></body></html>

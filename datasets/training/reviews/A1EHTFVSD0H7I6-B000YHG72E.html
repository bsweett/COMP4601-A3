<meta name="summary" content="Way Too Fun to Take Seriously"></head><body><p>Elf is one of my all-time favorite Christmas movies.<br /><br />Will Ferrell fans fall into two camps: the ones that appreciate his raunchy side, and those who find his goofy innocence charming.<br /><br />I'm in the second camp.<br /><br />My children and I quote Elf often. "Does somebody need a hug?" is a favorite.<br /><br />But I know perfectly wonderful people who hated the movie.<br /><br />If you go for art or brilliant acting/writing, or a deep heartfelt message to take away with you -- you probably shouldn't go there with Elf. The logical will be annoyed with the elf adoption and flying sleigh logistics.<br /><br />But if you find it at all amusing when grown men wear tights and get sideswiped by taxis, Elf may be singing your song. Does excessive childlike behavior no matter how old the child, coax a smile? Then Elf may be a movie you'll add to your favorites list.<br /><br />Elf may fall into that category with Napoleon Dynamite...either you love it or you hate it. And I'm a Napoleon fan.  I even loved Nacho Libre, Three Amigos and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. Give me an excellent sight gag, some physical humor and a few great one-liners and I'm in.</p></body></html>

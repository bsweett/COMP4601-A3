While I enjoyed the first Ring somewhat, and thought the Grudge was creepy, this latest import didn't have any scares for me.  I didn't find it creepy at all, and the ending was rather sappy for my taste.  The Jennifer Connelly character did not invoke sympathy for me.  Decent performances from everyone, though I wasn't blown away by any of the actors.  I would save this for a rental or maybe even the showing on cable.</p></body></html>

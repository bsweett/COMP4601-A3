<meta name="summary" content="A missing child?"></head><body><p>"The Forgotten" is a forgetable tale surrounding the apparent death in a plane crash of a weepy Julianne Moore's 9 year old son Sam.  In the 14 months since the tragedy Moore has spent her time doting over her beloved son's memory, unable to let go.<br /><br />Things start heating up when items such as pictures, newspaper accounts and videos chronicling Sam's existence begin disappearing.  Moore, of course gets frantic because she's the only one that can acknowledge these vanishing items.  Her husband played by a gruesome looking Anthony Edwards is unsympathetic calling her delusional and claiming that there never was a son.  Moore's shrink played blandly by Gary Sinise agrees threatening hospitalization.<br /><br />Moore thinks she's psychotic until she hooks up with acquaintaince Dominic West, an ex-hockey player whose daughter also apparently perished in the same plane crash.  He unfortunately cannot remember his daughter but with prodding from Moore his memory returns.<br /><br />It soon becomes apparent that there is some sort of clandestine government plot as West and Moore are being pursued by federal agents.  This seems to be orchestrated by a mysterious stranger played by Linus Roache who is imbued with supernatural abilities.<br /><br />This flick represents 96 minutes of uninspired movie making.  The plot is never fully explained and outside of a few startling moments is boring.  The acting is unremarkable except for veteran actress Alfre Woodard who plays a sympathetic New York City detective.<br /><br />My advice is to pass on this one.</p></body></html>

As a child I both read and watched the movie versions although I only had a vague recollection of them going into this film. An excellent group of actors both adult and child wise. The set was colourful and very techno for the time period and the ompaas were hilarious although they might be scary for small children. Depp was an eccentric and somewhat egocentric Wonka but delightful to just look at. Other than Charlie the kids were perfectly deplorable and you can't wait to see what will happen to the next rotten child (no one is killed). I found it entertaining and would watch it again.</p></body></html>

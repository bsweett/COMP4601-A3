Being one of the longest books in the series, it was plainly clear to me that a lot was going to get cut out. In fact, pretty much all of the sub-plots are gone, making Harry (of course) the focus of the film instead of going into these pointless directions. For those who haven't read the books and have only seen the films, I don't find it necessary that we see Hermione preaching about the rights of house elves, Harry living at the Dursleys (I think after three movies, the audience gets that they're cruel to him) and the Weasleys taking him for the summer and the Quidditch World Cup. Much like my complaint about Ian Fleming describing eighteen excruciating holes of golf in Goldfinger and the movie version trimming it to the last two holes, you can't expect an audience to sit around and watch and still find the main story interesting. Another prime example of sub-plot cutting is Peter Jackson's adaptations of three LOTR books. If he had included Tom Bombadil's scenes, the audience would probably be still be watching Fellowship for at least another hour. Now that that rant's over, lets move on to the cast. Main cast is still excellent, and now they've finally discovered the opposite sex, which leads to some humorous moments and a stunning entrance by Hermione at the Yule Ball definitely made Harry and Ron's heads turn. Ralph Fiennes, who is practically unrecognizable under Voldemort's make-up (maybe he still feels ashamed for The Avengers), just oozes evil and I detect a hint of elegance in the character. Action sequences are some of the best though the dragon scene does drag a little but the fight with Voldemort is an exciting one. Patrick Doyle picks up the music department in this and, though ably picks up Williams' themes, adds his own touch to the franchise, making this a better score than the first two and just slightly better than the third.</p></body></html>

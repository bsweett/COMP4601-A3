It is rated R for a change, the way these films are meant to be shown. Ryan Reynolds shows a very good range in acting here, pushing himself further away from that "Van Wilder" role and that is a good thing. My only complaint was that the film was a little short, running just under 90 minutes. They could have shown more family interaction in the scenes that we didn't see from Day 1 to Day 15. It just seemed a little rushed at times, but the scares were there and they did not disappoint. Ignore the critics this time around and just read the reviews here on Amazon from people like you and me (who haven't had are brains burned out from watching 10 movies a week like Roger Ebert). This is one worth checking out on the big screen and I will be buying the DVD.</p></body></html>

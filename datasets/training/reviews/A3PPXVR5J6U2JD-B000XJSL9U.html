What made Die Hard so great wasn't just that it was an action movie, but that it was an old-fashioned tale of cops-and-robbers juiced with testosterone and lots of explosions.  John McClane (Bruce Willis) was an ordinary cop thrust into an extraordinary situation, an American-grown defender of justice given the opportunity to strike back against international invaders.  Or so it seemed; the joke was on us.  The original villain was actually just a petty thief, using the tactics of terrorists to cover his operations.  It was a stroke of genius and prescient insight into how the world really works.<br /><br />Part and parcel of McClane's "normal guy"-ness was his ability to withstand pain and keep functioning.  And for that to happen, McClane had to get beat up, stabbed, burned, and otherwise bloodied. McClane was cool in an old-school way; with his stubble, his mumbled asides, and his often-bewildered expressions, he was a fantasized version of every teenage boy (and adult) who didn't have leading man good looks or huge muscles. And he always had a personal stake; McClane was our National Guardsman, protecting his family from crime.<br /><br />As they say, the more things change, the more they stay the same, and so we're back to Die Hard once more.  This has to be the first action movie explicitly based on an article, John Carlin's 1997 "A Farewell to Arms" for Wired magazine.  Basically, the article details a "fire sale" - an attack that postulates the next major terrorist attack on America will include an electronic element, combining an electronic attack on the nation's infrastructure with a brute force physical attack.<br /><br />Into this mix is our pal John, escorting Matt Farrell (Justin Long, AKA the "Mac Guy") to a government safe house.  It turns out all the hackers who helped develop the codes to infiltrate the U.S. infrastructure are being eliminated, and Farrell is the only one to have escaped.  Thus ensues a new breed of buddy movie, "Boomer Meets Gen Y," and all the hilarity that entails.<br /><br />Live Free or Die Hard is as much about the consequences of cybeterrorism as it is about the differences in generations.  The dialogue between Farrell and McClane centers around these differences in understanding and accepting technology, and what it means to be a hero.  In the end, they discover they have a lot to learn from each other (awwww).<br /><br />The movie is not without its flaws.  The PG-13 editing is very noticeable; Willis resorts to grunting and groaning instead of swearing like he did in the earlier films.  He moans and groans so loudly that it starts to get comical.  There is not one but two unbelievable battles with aircraft that strain credulity, even for a Die Hard movie; I was willing to forgive Car vs. Helicopter, but Eighteen-Wheeler vs. VTOL Jet was just ludicrous.  VTOL jets are for taking off and landing, not having old-fashioned showdowns on bridges.  And yet, the special effects are so amazing that it's hard to nitpick.<br /><br />The other problem is the villain, Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant).  His disturbing actions are far more cutthroat and scary than his physical presence on screen.  As an actor, Olyphant just can't pull it off.  By the time McClane reaches him, you just want him to slap the kid upside the head and pull the plug on his computer. And of course, Gabriel's motives are no more noble than the villain from the first movie.<br /><br />In theory, there's a subplot about McClane's daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), but she doesn't have much to do here other than be a hostage.  On the other hand, there's the addition of Kevin Smith as Warlock, a superhacker, that's just hilarious.  To people who care about Star Wars and Kevin Smith, anyway.<br /><br />Live Free or Die Hard tries to have it both ways, appealing to the younger (PG-13 movie release) and older generations (unrated DVD version) and engaging them in a debate about what it is to be a hero. As a believable tale of one man saving the nation, it's often overshadowed by its big-budget special effects. As an action movie, it's a worthy entry in the Die Hard franchise.</p></body></html>

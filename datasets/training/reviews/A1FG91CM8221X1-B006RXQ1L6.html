<meta name="summary" content="The Best Film of 2002."></head><body><p>Every once in a while an unknown director comes along who serves notice of extraordinary talent, such as Orson Welles with "Citizen Kane" or Francis Ford Coppola with "The Godfather." It's hard to say how Rob Marshall's career will turn out, but he serves notice with "Chicago" that his name can be mentioned without embarrassment in the same sentence as Welles' and Coppola's. In a time when movie musicals are a nearly moribund art form, "Chicago" is one of the very few ever made that approaches the excitement and immediacy of a musical live on stage. Movie musicals notoriously offer myriad pitfalls for bathos, usually involving stars who can't sing or dance or directors who don't know how to stage a musical number. Marshall, a choreographer by training, wrings every inherent drop of excitement and pizzazz from every number, and he takes care to hire stars who CAN sing and dance--most notably Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones, both perfect for a musical set in the Jazz Age. They look like Clara Bow and Louise Brooks reborn, they sing wonderfully, they dance with elegance and panache, and they have more than enough sexiness and charisma to be proclaimed the "It Girls" for this generation. And what characters they get to play: Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, two murderesses sharing the same unctuous lawyer (Billy Flynn, played by Richard Gere) and the same uncanny instincts for survival and publicity. Coming less than a decade after the O.J. Simpson trial and in the midst of the "Reality TV" craze, this smart, funny, scaldingly cynical film has much of importance to say about the vicious triviality of American celebrity culture. If you can take your eyes off Zellweger and Zeta-Jones--and that is, admittedly, very hard--you will note the abundant excellence of Queen Latifah, as venal jailhouse matron "Mama" Morton, and John C. Reilly--perhaps this generation's finest character actor, and with an unexpectedly lovely singing voice--as Zellweger's sad-sack hubby, Amos. As for Richard Gere, much has been made in the press of his being snubbed by Oscar. No one besides Gere could have made the brazen dishonesty of Billy Flynn so engaging, and he acquits himself well in his song-and-dance numbers. But whereas Gere is very good and memorable, the others--Zellweger, Zeta-Jones, Latifah and Reilly--are mesmerizing and unforgettable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Could have been much more compelling"></head><body><p>I didn't hate this film.  I have seen plenty that are<br />much worse, and that were a greater waste of my precious time.  However, after seeing all the hype and all the award nominations, I came to this film with high expectations, and it simply did not deliver.  What could have been an extremely compelling story ultimately comes off as feel-good fluff much of the time.<p>Plenty of historical fact has been omitted from this movie, but that is no different than any number of movies that are &quot;based on a true story.&quot;  There is no big crime in this; if you want a faithful, comprehensive picture, go read a book.  This is a Hollywood movie, for crying out loud.  Trying to cram a person's entire life story into 136 minutes means that lots of details will have to be left out. <p>The problem is that the omitted details make for one hell of an interesting story!  Bisexuality, numerous affairs, an abandoned illegitimate child, a marriage that was much rockier than the film implied, rank anti-semitism...it all adds up to an individual who very complex and interesting.  The fact that the man has been a complete lout at times does not lessen the heroism of his struggle, or the significance of his achievements.<p>The fact is that just about all of us are equally capable of simultaneously being heroes and cads, but we prefer not to face the dualism of our existence. Here was an opportunity to confront that dualism, in one of its more extreme manifestations, and explore it.  Ron Howard could have done that, but he copped out and left us with a sugar-coated, pre-fab,<br />feel-good movie.</p></body></html>

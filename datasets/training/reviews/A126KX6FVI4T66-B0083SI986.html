<meta name="summary" content="a culture that has no respect for elders will pay for it"></head><body><p>Gang violence in cultural enclaves or ghettos has gotten pretty<br />much out of hand in many cities where the police have ceased<br />to be any real protection against drive by shootings<br />and rapes. Here an Asian gang in a formerly all white suburb<br />terrorized an young Hmong man and his family.<br />The Gran Torino was pretty much of a failure as a 70's muscle car<br />( much like the Edsel before it),<br />but thirty years later is has become a classic that the old<br />fellow cherishes who has just lost his wife and is himself dying of an<br />advanced lung disease. The young Irish Catholic parish priest is sort of a dead pan<br />comedy relief ( pretty much clueless in the middle of modern decay):<br />these Irish priests show up in Mexican American Catholic churches<br />without a clue about modern life of the communities they are supposed to be serving.<br />The martyr theme here is one that is faulted by the fellow already<br />being on the way to a painful death?</p></body></html>

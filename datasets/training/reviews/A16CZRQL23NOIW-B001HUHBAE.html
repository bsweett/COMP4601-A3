<meta name="summary" content="A MYSTERY INSIDE AN ENIGMA  !"></head><body><p>Zodiac is one these movies that from the very beginning one presents its enormous artistic ambition. Zealously narrated, with a visible documentary style and photographed in sepia and autumnal colors as obsessive frame that reaffirm and accent the puzzled, intriguing and mysterious set of events since 1966 of a compulsive but very smart murderer, who acted according patterns based on solar cycles, that literally commoved and made a true scandal, because of the effrontery and unexpected logic around their next victims.<br /><br />A hunter caricaturist - Robert Graysmith - and a scrupulous journalist - Paul Avery- decide by themselves to intend reconstruct step by step each one of the crimes, and investigate by themselves with an ethereal support of the assigned investigators for this entangled and complex puzzle.<br /><br />Leaving aside all the efforts displayed by this ceaseless caricaturist trying by all his means to find out any striking evidence that be considered as relevant and irrefutable to discover the identity of this vanishing and disturbed-mind assassin, the movie makes us to reflect around the multiple bureaucratic  barriers between the different counties in which the different massacres were made, as well as the smart legal strategies that froze and so many untied clues, that joined with such perverse and astute criminal mind, made of this sounded case a real unsolved enigma during 38 years.<br /><br />David Fincher once more astonished us through his zealous camera handle, the fabulous edition process in order to present us during more than 150 minutes, the most significant details of such case.<br />c entire cast and evidently the employment of the music as allusive reference to emphasize certain insights into the drama, the outdoor stages were carefully made, taking into account with admirable accuracy designs of dress and reconstruction of cars of those ages.<br /><br />Slow-paced film that demands from you your entire attention.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="X3-What would Bryan Singer do?"></head><body><p>When watching the third X Men movie, one cannot help but wonder if Bryan Singer was involved in the movie.Brett Ratner does a credible job on his contribution to a movie franchise that Singer defined.<br /><br /> The movie is loaded with great action sequences,new characters,plot twists and and resolutions.Unfortunately at 105 minutes it crams in too much when an over two hour screen time would better service under developed elements(The Phoenix,and the off-screen death of a beloved X-Men)and characters(Angel,Beast,Juggernaught,Rogue).<br /><br />  The endings leaves the door open for this not to be the "Last" stand of the cinimatic adventure of the X-Men.</p></body></html>

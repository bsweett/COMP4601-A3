<meta name="summary" content="Unsurpassed teenage theme movie"></head><body><p>I saw BC twice before, but many years ago.  U have always wanted to own it.  Unprepared to wait for the 25 Anniversary DVD, I bought this barebones DVD release.  To be fair, this DVD was released in 1998 when the format was quite new.  I'll get to the DVD issues later.<br />BC is a fantastic film focussing on 5 teenagers who have to do detention on a Saturday at school. The character development is brilliant as is the acting.  The narrative is simple yet compelling.  <p>DVD SUMMARY:<p>As mentioned above, this DVD came out in 1998.  It is a basic DVD with poor features (and some typing errors too). The movie is Widescreen 1:85 but not anamorphic - despite this, picture quality is ok.  The black bars are rather large though, if you have a 16:9 TV you may be able to minimise these.<p>The sound quality is the DVD's biggest let-down.  Mono city, and does it show!  Sounds so flat and can be hard to hear what characters are saying in some scenes.  <p>But even with these letdowns, the DVD is worth owning for the film alone.  It is a film you will want to watch over and over.  I'll also be buying the 25th Anniversary DVD if it eventuates.</p></body></html>

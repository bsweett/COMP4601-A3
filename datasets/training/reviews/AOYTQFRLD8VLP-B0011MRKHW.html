Elizabeth has been England's ruler for over a quarter century, and is now 52.<br /> She deals with threats of  invasion by Spanish King Phillip II(Jordi Molla), her ex-half-brother-in-law, and plots  against her that are a little closer to home by Scottish Queen Mary Stuart(Samantha Morton), her Catholic cousin, whose legitimate claim to the English throne is supported by Spain and Rome, but who arguably overplays her hand in dealing with her cousin.<br /> Meeting with her council members, her chief advisor Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush)advises her to monitor England's Catholic population more closely. While omitting her famous line, "I will not make a window on men's and women's souls", the Queen's(onscreen) actions reveal this. She vows to punish her people only based only on their deeds, not their beliefs (which in reality, didn't happen).<br /> The story omits  the Queen's most trusted advisor, William Cecil, as well as Robert Dudley, Sir Robert Cecil, and Robert Devereaux, and focuses on her relationship with Sir Walter Raleigh (the ruggedly handsome Clive Owen, with radiant charisma, but looking as though he stepped from the canvas of an oil painting), who has just returned from the New World, having named the colony of Virginia in honor of the Virgin Queen, with the bounty of the New World, a few Native Americans, and pirated treasure from Spanish ships in tow.<br /> One has to overlook many historical inaccuracies to enjoy the performances of the beautifully intelligent Abbie Cornish as the Queen's ward, and most-favored lady-in waiting, Bess Throckmorton, Christian Brassington as the Archduke of Austria ( whose appearance recounts an episode of the storied Queen's life that took place earlier than the 1580s), David Threfall as Royal Astrologer, John Dee, whose prediction  of a war between two Empires, and vaguary surrounding those details troubles Elizabeth, Eddie Redmayne, as Anthony Babington, the Jesuit's recruit to assassinate the English Queen, Rhys Ifans as co-conspirator and envoy to Spain, Robert Reston, and Adam Godley as Francis Walsingham's traitorous brother, William.<br /> We are led through sundry intrigues, and court rituals, as well as the Queen's dramatic response to a threat by a Spanish Ambassador in which she claims to have  an internal "hurricane that can strip Spain bare", before we come to the high drama surrounding the trial and execution of Mary Stuart, an incident which causes Elizabeth much distress and may well have made her re-live the similar scenario involving her own mother, although she may have been too young to remember the latter.Tom Hollander's Sir Amyas Paulet, presides over the Scottish Queen's demise.<br />  Under the observant eye of his  daughter, the Infanta Isabel (who was actually 21 in 1588, but here is portrayed by child actress Aimee King, decked out like a 16th century Wednesday Addams),a vengeful King Phillip, who supported Mary Stuart, declares Holy War on England.Elizabeth has to forgive Raleigh's seduction of Bess to appoint him as captain of her naval forces.<br /> The climax of the film is the dramatic confrontation of the Spanish Armada, where Henry VIII's once unwelcome daughter presides over an astonishing victory. The cinematography of this scene is particularly bold.<br /> Dealing with life and death matters among her closest subjects shortly thereafter, she settles into her role as mother of her people, and helps England close the 16th century on a golden note.<br /> The acting and the costumes are superb, and I have often felt the best historical dramas are ones that resemble moving oil paintings of the time they depict on canvas. Director Kapur succeeds in creating that effect here.</p></body></html>

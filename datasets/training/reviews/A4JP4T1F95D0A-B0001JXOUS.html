I know a lot of people don't think Cruise is a fantastic actor, but I think he does a great job in this film.  A lot of people don't think Costner is a great actor, but many think he did great in Dances With Wolves.  The Last Samurai is Cruise's Dances With Wolves.  It takes place in the same relative time period, and it involves a man taken into a new culture and learning to respect and love it.  Lots of tremendous Japanese actors, and great fighting and battle scenes.  It also features a terrific Ninja battle.  Give this one a try, it is worth the effort.</p></body></html>

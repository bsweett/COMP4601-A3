<meta name="summary" content="Effective British Horror Fim"></head><body><p>Where the best horror films succeed is not with gore but in establishing the mood of dread.  "28 Days Later" concerns itself with a virus that ravages the populace of Britain, turning those infected into flesh eating zombies.  The zombies depicted in the film are not the scariest aspect of the film.  That would be the sight of the desolate London streets where terror potentially lurks behind any corner.  The survivors in the film seek each other out and learn that sanctuary can be found in the North.  Sanctuary is found at a military base camp and this is where the film goes somewhat awry.  Give credit to director Danny Boyle for mounting an impressive, scary picture on what was probably a limited budget by U.S. standards.  As I have stated previously, the film begins ominously and maintains that tone until the sojourn to the base camp.  The DVD contains the film's original ending and an alternate ending that's quite different than the one originally in theatres.  Not to betray the suspense for anybody who has not seen the film, I prefer the original ending.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="No Country for Old Men"></head><body><p>I want to start by saying `No Country For Old Men' has one of the most menacing bad guys of the many films that I have seen. He is mostly eerily silent and when he does talk it is quietly and controlled, he is ruthless, unrelenting and with an almost psychopathic element to his nature. This alone would make for compelling viewing before you add in the storyline of the film. From the word go this film has a dark and brooding atmosphere to it and the tension is palpable and only builds as it progresses. Following one man who stumbles across a case full of money, another trying to track him down and the sheriff who is trying to protect and serve, provides the hunter and hunted plot that keeps you fully engrossed. This has amazing performances from all involved, Brolin, Lee-Jones and Bardem are all riveting to watch and this is probably Tommy Lee-Jones' best performance to date. You get the added bonus of Woody Harrelson in a minor role and yet he still manages to deliver another top job as he always does. At just under two hours this film isn't excessively long and I found myself intrigued and on edge the whole time. The ending kind of fizzled out after ratcheting up the tension (hence the four stars) but overall this makes for satisfying viewing. This is one of those films on Amazon that seems to be either loved or hated and it has to be said that it's not your Hollywood, all action blockbuster, but it's all the better for that. If you like well acted, slow burning, beautifully directed and tension filled films, then this is the place to go. Well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

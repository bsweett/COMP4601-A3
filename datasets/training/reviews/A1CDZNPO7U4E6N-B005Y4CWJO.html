<meta name="summary" content="This Movie Will Be A Horror Classic!!"></head><body><p>This movie is one of the best movies ever made, and definitely one of my favorites. This movies takes you down to the boundaries of "Hell". Clive Barker has most certainly made history with "Hellraiser", and I don't think there will ever be one like it again. I love when Pinhead goes "Oh Kirsty, I have such sights to show you". Barker took gore to another level because I was definitely creeped out by Frank walking around with no skin on his very bloody, and very fleshy skeleton. There definitely aren't too many scary and orginal horror movies today but, "Hellraiser" is one of a kind.</p></body></html>

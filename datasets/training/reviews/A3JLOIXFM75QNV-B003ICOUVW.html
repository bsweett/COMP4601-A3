While the gothic atmosphere surrounds the entire film, the poor editing and lackluster acting really demotes The Wolfman. Benicio Del Toro is actually pretty bad in this. I can't tell if he is acting at all, which in this case, is not a good thing. He just sort of snarls some times and attempts to emote at other times, but it just wasn't working. Anthony Hopkins does slightly better, but his role is sadly underutilized and he can barely make an impact. Hugo Weaving is completely wasted here, a shame really as his acting has a broad range and he really didn't exibit any of it in this film. Emily blunt is subtle and sweet and while I liked her character, again, she just felt out of place.<br /><br />I mentioned the editing and UGH is it terrible. It jumps from scene to scene, from plot to plot and from one geographical area to a completely unknown one in bursts that it's extremely confusing at various times. There is no proper path from beginning to end, no direction of any kind. They tried to mix a mythical mystery with a love story and in the end it turned out to be a jumbled mess. I loved the dark, sort of spooky, grainy atmosphere and the costumes are always nice to look at, but, combined with the weak, barely-there plot, it was just a huge let-down. You can't call this a horror since there is nothing frightening about it and it's not really a drama since you really feel nothing for any of the characters. Perhaps I'm being generous with my 3 star rating, if I could give it 2.5 I would. I guess I have seen far worse than this, but still, a HUGE dissapointment.</p></body></html>

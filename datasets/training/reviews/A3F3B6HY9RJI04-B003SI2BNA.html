Everybody, including the little girl, do a superb acting job.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that is the only good thing I can say about this film.  I can't even think of who WOULD like this film.  It tries to be scary, but it isn't.  It tries to be smart, but it isn't.  There is no tension and the only part with a little bit of suspense was just weird.<br /><br />The Ring was great!  The Grudge was okay.  But this addaption of a Nakata film really missed the mark.</p></body></html>

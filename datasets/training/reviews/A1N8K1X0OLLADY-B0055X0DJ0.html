The type that loves to hear the actors say things such as "Punk A**" and "P****". Yes, the P word (I thought I saw a ***** cat) is used to make fun of someone in this movie.<br /><br />Also, scenes with the boys pet dogs having sex, many sexual references to the female actress, and 2 "urban" transformer twins who kept cursing and fighting each other. I guess "urban" transformers love to curse and fight each other.<br /><br />If you have a "properly functional" brain inside of your head, then save your money and skip this worthless movie.</p></body></html>

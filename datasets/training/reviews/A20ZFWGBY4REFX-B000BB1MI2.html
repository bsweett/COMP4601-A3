<meta name="summary" content="A magnificent retelling of Roald Dahl's timeless novel; Johnny Depp's best performance since "Pirates of the Caribbean"!"></head><body><p>For anyone born before say, 1980, the following words are enough to strike fear and giggles into the hearts of lads and lasses everywhere: "There's no earthly way of knowing which direction we are going. There's no knowing where we're rowing. Or which way the river's flowing. Is it raining? Is it snowing? Is a hurricane a blowing?" This is the chant that a deranged-looking Gene Wilder uttered as his magic gondola sailed down the chocolate river in 1971's "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory". It is a film that has delighted and spooked children for more than 30 years. And I had the pleasure of going to see this wonderful retelling of the now-named "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" not too long ago. The direction of Tim Burton ("Batman", "Sleepy Hollow") was nothing short of extraordinary! The performance of Johnny Depp ("Secret Window") as Willy Wonka was top-notch and hilarious! Supporting players include Freddie Highmore ("Finding Neverland") as Charlie Bucket, David Kelly ("Waking Ned Devine"), Helena Bonham Carter ("Fight Club"), Noah Taylor ("Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"), and Christopher Lee ("The Lord of the Rings" trilogy), in which they all gave unforgettable performances!<br /><br />For those who don't know the story, then hop into my gondola, everyone, and I'll tell you a little about a guy named Willy Wonka (Depp). He owns a big candy factory, and nobody's been in it for 15 years. And yet, it's been producing candy all this while. But how, if nobody comes in or out, does the candy get made? Little Charlie Bucket (Highmore) would like to know. He's a poor boy living on the outskirts of the Wonka factory in a strange, dilapidated house where his four ancient grandparents sleep in one large bed (two at the foot and two at the head). One day, after years of silence, Wonka announces to the world that he is putting five "golden tickets" into his delicious Wonka Bars, and the children who get them will be treated to a tour of the Wonka factory and vie for a chance to win a special prize at the end of the visit.<br /><br />Needless to say, Charlie gets one of the tickets, as do a quartet of prepubescent horrors: fat and gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), spoiled rich kid Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), competitive gum-smacker Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb, "Because of Winn-Dixie"), and the video-game-obsessed brat Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry). Wonka doesn't like these kids. He has unique ways of expressing disdain for each. And, in fact, each of the kids leaves the tour early, picked off by their own excesses. (Augustus falls into the chocolate river, Violet becomes a giant blueberry, etc.) We know throughout the movie that Charlie, along with his Grandpa Joe (Kelly), will make it all the way based on his kindness and manners. But what is the special prize?<br /><br />While Charlie is more fleshed out and real than the moppet of the first film, Wonka himself is a bizarre amalgam of Michael Jackson and Oscar Wilde -- only more androgynous than Michael and dandier than Oscar (imagine that!). Whereas Wilder's Willy Wonka was mischievously wise, Depp's is neurotic. He has family issues -- he can't bring himself to say "parent" -- from a troubled childhood with an overbearing dentist father (Lee). Wonka is not merely whimsical here. He is weird.<br /><br />Some may consider Depp's creation a miscalculation. But what kind of person could create a factory of such imagination and craziness and not be somehow crazy and imaginary in the process? The factory is a marvel -- very much like the one of the earlier film at first but more expansive and magical as it goes along. There are special effects now that were undreamt in 1971, and they are put to enchanting use. What exactly Roald Dahl's book and this film promotes in terms of childhood virtues is elusive. Is it moderate appreciation of candy? Respect for imagination? This is unclear. Crystal clear, however, is this: Quibble as you may, besides "Batman Begins", this is the most imaginative and delightful film so far this summer. It is a feast for the eyes and ears. (The Oompa Loompas, Wonka's trusty and diminutive servants, all played by Deep Roy, engage in dazzling production numbers, each themed around the exit of a bratty child. The horn section really soars.)<br /><br />And the chemistry between the strange Wonka and the responsible Charlie is touching and, at times, heartbreaking. This is Burton's most complete and rewarding film in years, especially since "Batman" and "Batman Returns", and certainly in a year full of "Fantastic Four"s and "Bewitched"s, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" succeeds as the most reverential and enjoyable remake. See it, either right now in the theaters or on DVD when it's released!</p></body></html>

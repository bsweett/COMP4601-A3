<meta name="summary" content="The gimmick works, pretty much"></head><body><p>The movie has the gimmick, "the Graduate" going for it. The movie has engaging actors, Aniston and Costner are very good. I smiled rather than laugh through the movie. Aniston pulls off the character, who played by anybody else would be an unlikeable character. You still like Aniston even though she treats her boyfriend like trash for most of the movie. Costner plays it just right, handsome, charming, and a bit of a rascal. You believe the women of this family falling for him.<br /><br />The movie in the last analysis is cotton candy. You really don't care that much if the main character gets together with lawyer boyfriend. It was a pleasant way to spend two hours, but they should have played more Simon and Garfunkel music. It would have helped.</p></body></html>

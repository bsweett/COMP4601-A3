<meta name="summary" content="A wooden planet?  Com'on..."></head><body><p>A previous reviewer gave a brief description of the original Vincent Ward script for Alien 3.  In it he mentions that Ward had Ripley crash landing on a wooden planet inhabited by monks who rejected technology and therefore they had no capability to fight the alien.  The reviewer says that this script would have been &quot;amazing&quot;.  Yeah, amazingly stupid.  A wooden planet???  This idea not only sounds stupid but it physically impossible. As anybody that knows anything about celestial bodies is that there's only two types of planetoids.  Rock-based or Gas-based.  Even a water or ice-covered planet has a rock mantle.  If Alien 3 would have been made with this script, it would have been the laughing stock of an otherwise great franchise up to this point.<p>But as Alien 3 turns out with Fincher's eventual direction, it not all that bad of a film.  Yeah, the theatrical cut was a bit disjointed with loose ends and missing parts, but this is something that the new working print has supposedly fixed to some degree.  While still not a perfect film, anything is better than this original wooden planet idea.</p></body></html>

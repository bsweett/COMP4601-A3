<meta name="summary" content="Touching and Entertaining Movie With Two of My Favorite Actors"></head><body><p>Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) are room-mates in a hospital that Cole actually owns. He insisted he was running a hospital and not a vacation spa, and there were no private rooms. Two patients to a room, no exceptions.<br /><br />They both have cancer, and both have terminal diagnoses. So Cole, who has way more money than he knows what to do with, proposes they spend their remaining time doing all the things they want to do before they die. The term "Bucket List" came from a professor where Carter went to college who asked them to compose such a list as a philosophy class exercise.<br /><br />So they do it. Some of the scenes are pretty funny, such as their skydiving adventure, their driving race cars, and so on. But it is also very thoughtful as they sit in a classy restaurant over caviar and talk about family matters.<br /><br />I won't spoil it by telling you what happens, but one item stands out. While in India visiting the Taj Mahal, they talk about funeral plans. Carter says he wants to be cremated, his ashes put in a tin can and buried somewhere wild. "Like a Chock Full of Nuts can?" jokes Cole, "The heavenly coffee!"<br /><br />The last scene is Cole's assistant placing a second Chock Full of Nuts can in the cairn at the top of a snow-capped mountain.</p></body></html>

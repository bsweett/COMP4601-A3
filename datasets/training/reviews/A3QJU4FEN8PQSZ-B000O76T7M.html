I mean, where's the challenge? There's no skill involved in tracking or blowing them to bits with your super lasers, is there? Or stealth, even, since you have your invisibility gadget. I started to compare it to humans hunting deer, but upon reflection, there is much more patience, skill, and discomfort there on the part of the hunters, who also seek to dispatch their meal with the best shot possible.<br /><br />On to the movie. The director actually succeeds in giving it enough human interest and getting us to like the characters in a suprisingly short period of time. Unfortunately they get killed off pretty quickly, too. The endgame gives us an interesting partnership scenario, and there are some OK AVP faceoffs, but the human cat-and-mouse stuff is not particularly interesting.<br /><br />So ... it could have been much worse. I liked it better than the last two sequels. And everyone who watches this movie knows in advance what they're getting into anyway.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Giamatti and Haden Church go Sideways"></head><body><p>Paul Giamatti (American Splendor, Storytelling) plays Miles, a man whose passion is wine and writing novels and Thomas Haden Church (Rolling Kansas, George Of The Jungle) plays Jack, a soon to be married man. Giamatti and Haden Church go take a little trip for the week test tasting wine and many other things. Haden Church, a soon to be married man goes crazy and hooks up with a single wine selling mom named Stephanie, played by Sandra Oh. Giamatti falls for divorced single wine lover Mya, played by Virginia Madsen (Candy Man, The Rainmaker). Tensions flare, comedy insues and a bunch of wine is consumed in this hilarious and  dramatic independent film directed by About Schmidt and Election director Alexander Payne. Giamatti and Haden Church give two performances that are simply outstanding and are among one of their best. Madsen is simply gorgeous as ever (Virginia Madsen is sister of actor Michael Madsen) and Sandra Oh is hot and spicy. Wine jargon to last you a life time but hey, now you know what to drink and what not to drink...thanks Sideways (2 thumbs up). I basically know what to do. It's delicate.... Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor one Oscar for best original screenplay. It also one a lot of Independent Spirit Awards...Giamatti one Best Actor.</p></body></html>

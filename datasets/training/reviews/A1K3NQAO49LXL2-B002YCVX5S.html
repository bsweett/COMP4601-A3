A film of long dialogue-intensive scenes (very long - the opener, especially, lasts forever, as does the long "basement bar" scene), it really could have done with some trimming. But... apparently, there were deleted scenes and new characters aplenty, including one created for Maggie Cheung!  (Huh?! How could you get Maggie Cheung to be in your film and then not use the footage?!?)<br /><br />Nice use of German and French and Italian, which is welcome for people who are not monolingual, but the film lacks a main character. Who is the film's protagonist? It's not Brad Pitt, nor any of the people on the movie poster. If anything, it's Shosanna Dreyfus, who is central to the opening scene as well as the main plot, but she doesn't have much screen time. Sure, the Basterds are busy striking fear in the Nazi's heart, but do we really care?<br /><br />What is interesting about the film itself is how two circumstantial plots come together to ensure the outcome, which I don't think I've seen in a film before. The other thing that is interesting is that the film appears to be leading to a sequel; I would think that part two could be more interesting than part one. Altogether it's a bit of a rarity - a film with a good plot/ending that doesn't do a great job establishing (most of) the characters.</p></body></html>

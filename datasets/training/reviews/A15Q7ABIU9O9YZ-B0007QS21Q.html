I don't believe that the Directorial Staff and writers of I, Robot really wrestled much with the purity of Asimov, Bradbury and Heinlein. When you watch the credits of a movie based on a book like, for example, Lehane's Mystic River, you'll see a reference, ' . . . from the book,' or '. . . based in part on . . . ' And then there's '<br /><br />. . . from an idea . . .'<br /><br />This is even more of a reach then that. Will Smith is actually a remarkable actor growing from a humble, 30-minute humorous quips (Fresh Prince) TV background. Now you can even say, 'he's the man.' And additionally, going back to the Ali days, he spends a lot of time in the gym. Because he is most assuredly,  buffed.<br /><br />But that's it. Not a serious examination of AI, interesting dialogue (and that's all) between Moynahan and Smith, and a Lassie like slobbering grin from the Robot Character "Sonny" that we are left to assume (yes, theologians) has a soul.<br /><br />Great special effects. Boring, predictable dialogue. The usual tedious quips the writers force Mr. Smith to make instead of just letting him act. NOTHING ELSE. 3 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

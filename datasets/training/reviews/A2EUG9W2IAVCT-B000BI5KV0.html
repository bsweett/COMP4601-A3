<meta name="summary" content="Good documentary"></head><body><p>Documentaries are often touchy affairs.  They require an (admirable--I'd never want to go to the coldest continent in the world for a year just to cover a movie) amount of intrigue and beauty to indulge viewers' interest.  March of the Penguins is one such documentary; of course, at a shockingly short in film-terms, but jam-packed, 80 minutes it seems like more care could've been taken (in my opinion, at least) on the lifecycle of the chicks instead of leaving them after they take their first swims.  Still, March of the Penguins is a highly enjoyable, at times even "cute" in all senses of the word movie covering the life, love and death of the Emperor Penguin in the barren, frozen wasteland of Antarctica.  The music is done beautifully as is the narration by veteran actor Morgan Freeman (who also narrated the opening and closing of the summer blockbuster War of the Worlds).  Of course, Hollywoo-dizing such a project is inevitable; some of the sounds have been added in to make it seem like the penguins are more vocal than they probably are, but it only adds to the film's allure.  Good documentary, intriguing storyline and an incredible look at the lives of some of nature's most adaptive creatures.</p></body></html>

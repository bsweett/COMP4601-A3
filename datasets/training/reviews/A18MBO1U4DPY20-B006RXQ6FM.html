He was great in "Before the devil knows you're dead" even though the film had an average storyline. Then in 2007 we had "The Savages" which I dare say is his best film. So when I heard praise about "Doubt", I knew that this was the film to watch out for. He is absolutely brilliant in his character and his dialogue delivery while narrating to a room full of adults and adolescents was wonderful. Meryl Streep kept him company and her stern, obstinate character was a treat to watch. The dialogues were good but it was the acting that made this film truly remarkable. This is the kind of self-proclaimed film critics like me love. You have to watch this. It goes right down to the wire and even after the film is over, you will feel like discussing it with that friend of yours who wants to be a book-writer someday. Excellent film overall. I only wish it was slightly longer but then that would have made it somehow flaky. Worth renting at the very least.</p></body></html>

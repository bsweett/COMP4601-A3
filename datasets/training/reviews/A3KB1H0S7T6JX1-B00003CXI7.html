Things become a little complicated when she begins to feel a strong sense of paranormal activity inside her house...<br />The movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category.<br />Michelle Pfeiffer, Harrison Ford, and most of the rest of the cast carry out their performances well.<br />The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the music, and the special effects, are all good.<br />In short, What Lies Beneath is a movie worth watching if you are in the mood for a decent thriller as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.  4 Stars</p></body></html>

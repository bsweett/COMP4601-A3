I was a sort of comic collector from 1980-90 and the X-MEN comics were always chock full o' great characters, complex stories, and great action.  Both movies have delivered those qualities and more.  It would be nice to see a comic book turned movie actually start a series instead of a few haphazard sequels that get sillier as realeased.  This movie rocks.  X-MEN was a nice intro for XAVIER's gifted students, in X2 the mutants really strut their stuff, both dramatically and with a fine showcase for their uncanny abilities.  Some great action set pieces highlight this crafted flick as well as a story that unlike most super hero movies is engaging and intelligent.  I can't wait for X3 to see what will happen next, how many sequels these days can you say that about?  Not many at all.  HUGH JACKMAN was born to play WOLVERINE, one of the best movie characters in years.  A good new fashoned comic book film with it's head and heart compounded in good storytelling and style, to me that's a great movie.</p></body></html>

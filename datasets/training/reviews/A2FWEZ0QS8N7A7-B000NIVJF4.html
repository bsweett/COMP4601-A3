<meta name="summary" content="See It for Forest Whitaker"></head><body><p>There is not much new light that The Last King of Scotland brings to the tragedy of Uganda under Idi Amin.  This is not history, but fiction.  Young white Scot becomes closest adviser to a brutal dictator?  That's preposterous enough, but ladling on Dr. Nicholas Garrigan's naivete and philandering with one of Amin's wives brings Last King down near the absurdist level.  The Africa portrayed, and very richly so with close-ups and other careful cinematography, is new only to Garrigan and those who have never had contact with the continent.  To those who have, it hits all the cliches and not much more.  Still, Last King has two big pluses.  First, the story -- absurd as it is -- is absorbing throughout and, second, I now understand why Forest Whitaker won the Oscar last year.  He nails Amin, his appeal, his brutality, and his buffoonery.<br /><br />Be warned -- some of King is very rough going.  Two scenes in particular -- a dead mutilated body and torture involving grappling hooks  -- are among the most disturbing I've seen in a film.<br /><br />Bottom line -- Whitaker captures Amin, but Last King does not do justice to Africa.</p></body></html>

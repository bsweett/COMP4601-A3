<meta name="summary" content="The hero in everyman"></head><body><p>He was always Capt. America, at least in spirit. He started out as the classic 98-pound weakling, then had his body scientifically bulked up to match his spirit. It resonates with the little kid in anyone that wants to be looked up to.<br /><br />Then, it takes place during WWII, the last war that Americans generally supported. It becomes clear early on that the war isn't against Germans as Germans, but against a specific group out for world domination - something that appeals to today's more carefully targeted kind of enmity. From there, it moves forward in an utterly earnest way, as if no one had ever heard of irony. Or much in the way of humor, either - after the wise-cracking Tony Stark of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C08RHA">Iron Man</a>, this comes across a bit bland. Tommy Lee Jones does what he can to pull this one along, but the movie's sodden weight seems too much even for him.<br /><br />On the whole, it's a more than adequate comic movie, but not one I'll be coming back to.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the releast to theaters</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Demonstrates what the art of filmmaking can achieve."></head><body><p>This is the quintessential 'serial killer' film that other moviemaker's have been tirelessly attempting to emulate without success.<p>After viewing it again for the third or fourth time, there are aspects of the film that became prominent - subtle techniques in direction and photography, which has made the film a masterpiece. For example, take a close look at the camera's constant change in perspective: we are able to see the story from each character's point of view, adding to the film's many layers of meaning. From the start, we are introduced to Starling - a vulnerable and intelligent female fighting to compete in a male dominated environment. This, of course, creates an instant empathy for the character, and sets us up for the first terrifying meeting with Hannibal Lecter. We are also permitted to view the world from Hannibal's perspective, looking through the glass cage of his cell at the vulnerable, Clarice. We are also permitted to see the world through the eye's of Buffalo Bill - as he plays-out his fantasies of becoming a beautiful woman in front of the mirror in his home. These techniques in cinematography are meant to hook our attention and submerge our minds into its world. And it works beautifully.<p>The other significant ingredient in the film that contributed to its massive appeal, both critically and at the box office, was Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter. I've always been intrigued about Hannibal Lecter's appeal for so many people. What is it about this character that fascinates? He's educated, artistic, has good taste in the finer things in life - wine, music, and literature and exudes a feeling that he is one of those individuals that really knows how to live, and live well. The man has class. However he's also a monster, a killer who enjoys eating his victims. The appeal, I believe, is in the contradiction: we don't associate 'class' with calculated slaughter - it just doesn't make sense. Hopkins's interpretation of this literary character, too, is right on the mark. Hopkins has brought this disturbing character to life with such realism that we can't imagine anyone else as Hannibal Lecter. And any other actor attempting this role in the future would be doomed to failure.<p>This film won a score of Oscars, including best picture, directer, best actor and best actress. Jodie Foster has always been a pleasure to watch in her many performances over the years. Her performance as Special Agent Starling deserved the Oscar and all the critical acclaim she received.<p>~Silence of the Lambs~ has to be one of the great films of the twentieth century. I believe it out ranks its sequel and the prequel, (though these films are also well done) because everything from the screenplay to the soundtrack is first rate. This DVD should be owned and viewed at least once a year to demonstrate what the art of filmmaking can achieve. Brilliant.</p></body></html>

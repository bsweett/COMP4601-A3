<meta name="summary" content="A Darker and More Thrilling Narnia"></head><body><p>Prince Caspian is the second film in the Narnia franchise and definintly avoids a lot of the miss falls of sequels, becoming a very worthy addition to the franchise.<br /><br />The film continues on after the first film, with the Pevensie children returning to Narnia a year after their first adventure. But as they look around them, they realise that this is not the same Narnia of which they remembered. It turns out that over a thousand years have passed and Narnia has been invaded by the Telmarine's, who have pushed the Narnians into extiction and hold over the land with an iron grip. The children are now forced to take back their land, with the aide of the exiled Telmarine Prince Caspian, who seeks the throne from his murderous uncle Miraz.<br /><br />Like many fantasy films, this sequel is darker then the first, with a lot more action and battles then in LWW, which should appease fans who found that the action was skimping. The effects have also improved a lot as well and the addition of such characters as the mouse Reepicheep and Trumpkin the drawf adds some comic relief.<br /><br />While this is a good sequel, I still don't think it exceeds the first film and that although there is a good dose of action, the magic dosen't really feel that present. However, I still think fans of the books will love this installment and will be waiting for the next one to come.</p></body></html>

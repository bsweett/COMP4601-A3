<meta name="summary" content="INTELLECTUALLY DOOZY BUT A BRISK LITTLE THRILLER"></head><body><p>Red Eye might defy reality with ideas that border perilously on campy -- an airlines called Fresh Air for instance -- but it knows itself well enough to have its say in 90 minutes and move on.<br /><br />Our two protagonists face off in the claustrophobic confines of an airliner en-route to Miami. We manage to compress some gripping inflight suspense between a credible hitman sent to assassinate a government official and his family, and his grossly underestimated co-passenger and threat target, a young female executive of the swank Miami hotel where the official will be staying.<br /><br />I recommend not reading too much of the plot but this private little drama between hunter and prey plays out rather well as the plane careens towards Miami. Sadly, soon as we land, all the twisty onboard suspense culminates into a horribly pat wham-bam climax straight out of the screen writer's fantasy. The film is perhaps partially saved by a taut script, and some well delivered action.<br /><br />Decent rental if you are in the mood for a template psycho-political thriller. I enjoyed it for what it was worth, but this is one that cries out for suspension of disbelief.</p></body></html>

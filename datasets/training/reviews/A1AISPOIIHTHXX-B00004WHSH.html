<meta name="summary" content="Influential filmmaker's final film..."></head><body><p>1999 was a pretty big year for movies. From the groundbreaking effects of the "Matrix" to the phenomenon that was the "Sixth Sense" to the "Phantom Menace", the first Star Wars film in 16 years, it was quite an eventful year. In addition to that there was "Eyes Wide Shut", the latest film by influential director Stanley Kubrick, his first in 12 years and would end up being his final film. It of course got massive hype: from the fact he was finally making something new, to the star power of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman to its long shoot (400 days), excitement was huge and it can be fair to say disappointment was bigger. It's a fine film sure but it might not be everyone's idea of Kubrick's last hurrah.<br /><br />Bill and Alice Harford are a married couple of 9 years with a 7 year old daughter, Helena. Attending a party at a friend's place, the 2 of them separate and start to flirt with partygoers looking for a more intimate setting. They both decline and the next day, Alice reveals a truth: a one night stand she desperately wanted to have happen a year earlier that she didn't act on. This sends Bill on a journey through the streets of New York and exploring that possibility of being with someone that's not his wife but what he discovers is potentially more dangerous than just infidelity.<br /><br />The advertising made you believe that you were getting into some completely raunchy and X-rated with sex scenes and nudity running rampant. Turns out most of the nudity isn't played in scenes of sexual nature but just natural part of life and one's body. As for the sex, well, it looks explicity but you've probably seen worse. With this much press and speculation, you can practically see the audience's eyes giving a sense of shock; "that's it?" on their minds once the film's over. It's a slow, deliberately paced film with many characters chatting to each other with nary a mind-warping "Star Child" sequence or a hyper-edited sex scene to the William Tell Overture. This makes it more dreamlike but people might find it boring.<br /><br />With a star like Cruise in the lead role, some might find it distracting. He's gotten to that "superstar" level of acting where people see him less as an actor and more like a celebrity who just so happens to be an actor. While there is moments that seem "Cruise-y" in the film, it happens to be one of his more layered characters, along with Frank Mackey from "Magnolia". But it's Kidman who probably has the more interesting role to play since by the end of the film, you still can't get a handle on just what exactly this characters wants and whether what she says is the real thing. But this is the Bill show as we spend more time with him than Alice which is kind of a shame.<br /><br />Although it may not have that must-have status that a lot of Kubrick films have, don't think that it's a bad film because of it. It may not please everyone but it's at least a fine film on its own and a strange but fitting end to a long career.</p></body></html>

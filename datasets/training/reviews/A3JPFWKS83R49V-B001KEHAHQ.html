<meta name="summary" content="Another Remake, Another Disappointment"></head><body><p>This 2006 movie remake is a comedy film with plenty of slapstick, sex jokes, fart jokes, and physical- type humor. It offers Kevin Kline and Steve Martin in the main roles and having watched the original Pink Panther and one of the Pink Panther follow ups (Return of the Pink Panther), I can say with confidence that this version isn't very good. With the original Pink Panther, you had David Niven and Peter Sellers in the starring roles in a comedy movie that was fun, original, and entertaining all the way through thanks to the performances and the script. With this version, you have a movie that relies on fart jokes, vases stuck to Steve Martin's hands, bullets falling out of a revolver, and other assorted silliness for its entertainment value.<br /><br />In some ways, one can't help but laugh during certain moments of this film- even when the comedy isn't very mature or very original. Take for instance a scene near the beginning where Steve Martin's Inspector Clouseau character is trying to parallel park his small car between two other cars. There is plenty of room, but the idiotic Clouseau keeps backing the car and moving it forward, hitting the car in front and the car behind and causing the bumpers to fall off of each of the two vehicles. It isn't original and it isn't intelligent but you find yourself laughing anyway. Much of the comedy in the rest of the movie is of the same variety. It does make you laugh a little, but the humor is more the result of the comedy's goofiness than genuine funniness.<br /><br />Among the performers in this movie, the only one worth mentioning is Steve Martin and his portrayal of the French- accented character, the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau. Martin's Clouseau character is confidently incompetent- the type of person who thinks they are right about everything when they are actually right about nothing. Many critics have already attacked Martin because he isn't very much like Peter Sellers- the original Jacques Clouseau. It is inevitable that critics and viewers try to compare this movie and its performers to the original (I'm guilty of this, too), but I don't think it's fair to criticize Steve Martin for not being more like Peter Sellers. First, it would be very tough to match Sellers in playing the role of Jacques Clouseau. Second, Martin's character, aside from the accent, is really a character all his own- a new version, if you will, of Inspector Jacques Clouseau. If anything, Martin's character reminds me of the Clouseau from the Pink Panther cartoons. In fact, much of the comedy in this movie is like that of a cartoon. With the bumping, the banging, and the general physical nature of the humor, it reminds me of old Pink Panther cartoons with a touch of Bugs Bunny.<br /><br />Other than Steve Martin, I didn't find anyone else in this movie particularly memorable. Kevin Kline was ok, and so was Beyonce Knowles. But no one stands out in this movie as someone who has contributed a great performance. Martin is the only one who gets your attention. The goofy French accent and his wild and crazy persona are the only parts of this movie that make it worthwhile, in spite of the sub par script and the slower than average pacing.<br /><br />Overall, The Pink Panther is a comedy with few laughs, weak writing, and even less originality. It scores a few points for Steve Martin's zany portrayal of Inspector Jacques Clouseau, but other than that, the film is a wipe out. It's like a glass of American brewed light beer: Weak- bodied and wimpy but with just enough taste and ease of consumption to keep you from dumping it down the drain.</p></body></html>

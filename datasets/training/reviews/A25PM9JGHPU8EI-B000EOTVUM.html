This is one of the best horror films to come along in a long time mainly because of John Jarratt who plays his character VERY believably. Greg McLean did a terrific job ratcheting up the tension and I applaud his most effective use of violence to freak the kids and you, the audience, out. When I saw this, people were getting up and walking out - a sign that this film worked in its ability to shock and horrify. I truly hope the version I saw survived the MPAA and didn't have to be cut into a chopped-down edit. If it did, well we all have the "Director's Cut" dvd to look forward to. See it and feel the horror.</p></body></html>

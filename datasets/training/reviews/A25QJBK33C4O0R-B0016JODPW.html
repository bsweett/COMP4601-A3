<meta name="summary" content="Twists that are too predictable.  Not as good as I had hoped..."></head><body><p>I went into watching this film having remembered that it was talked about as a possible award winner for some of the persons involved, but was left disappointed in a film that was too predictable and relied too much on a story-telling device that just didn't work that well for me.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand, I enjoy non-linear story-telling when it makes sense, and I've thoroughly enjoyed some films that others felt went on far too long (see Taratino's Jackie Brown as an example in that area), telling the tale too many times and from too many different angles (perhaps), but this film, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, just isn't as good despite decent performance from the actors and actresses involved.  Where I should have been surprised by twists, I was left nodding my head at how things were just as I expected and predicted.  Seeing parts of the story told again and again, just from different perspectives, just seemed to be a waste of screen time for this film and that is disappointing to me.  I didn't necessarily expect more, but still felt disappointed by not finding it in the film.<br /><br />Sidney Lumet has done great work in the past and I don't think he did horribly here, but it's far from his best.  Though the product description calls this as a suspense thriller and it tries to deliver, it seemed lacking in that area for me because it was too easy to anctipate what was coming next.  Oh, there are a few twists, but those twists burn quickly and barely raise the interest that they should.<br /><br />The film is worth seeing, but it isn't a film that would be interesting to watch multiple times, leaving the value as a potential purchase lacking.  It is a dark film and is depressing.  A crime gone wrong with horrible consequences and a look at the events leading up to and after the crime all played out several times just so we can be sure we didn't miss something along the way.  When all is said and done, there are other films that do a better job for me (though I'm hard pressed to think of exactly which films those would be at the moment), and certainly other films that make good use of the actors that worked here.</p></body></html>

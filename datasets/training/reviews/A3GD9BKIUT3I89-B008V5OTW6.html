<meta name="summary" content="Not the First"></head><body><p>If no one noticed, Spielberg's movie is NOT the first filmed version of the Jonas book (and before that headlines in a series of articles by Jack Anderson).  That honor belongs to director Michael Anderson's (AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, LOGAN'S RUN) THE SWORD OF GIDEON.  It ran on HBO about 20 years earlier.  The cast included Steven Bauer, Michael York, Collen Dewhearst (as Golda Meair) and Rod Steiger in the role of the Mossad chief.  Search this one out and you won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Heores are superheroes in the modern society"></head><body><p>"The Incredibles" is another digitally animated hit from Pixar Studios. It's a spoof of the superhero genre, as well as a spoof on the audience that found it so amusing. It's one of the more clever movies of 2004.<br /><br />Suppose there was a superhero and his female counterpoint. They race around and do good. What would happen in America, the movie asks? They'd be sued as a consequence of their lawbreaking. They'd be retired.<br /><br />Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, who have married, are retired by law and sent into a relocation program. There they take mundane jobs and sire three kids. But you can't keep superheroes down. When a dastardly plot develops, the Incredible family is called upon.</p></body></html>

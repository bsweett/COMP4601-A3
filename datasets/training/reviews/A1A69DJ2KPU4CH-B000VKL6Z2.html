<meta name="summary" content="Another Worthless, Pointless Remake"></head><body><p>If you're going to remake a classic horror movie such as Psycho, Friday the 13th, When a Stranger Calls, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Amityville Horror, or Halloween you better be a masterful director, and you better have a new, unique, and interesting way of presenting the material. Unfortunately all of the Hollywood horror remakes of the past 10 or so years have failed miserably in all regards. Halloween is no different.<br /><br />Rob Zombie tried to add a unique twist by delving into Michael's childhood and what might have contributed to creating the monster he became, but it's so cliched and trite as to not matter. Boy grows up with abusive step father and his mother is a stripper with a heart of gold. This abusive environment leads to a boy who kills animals for fun and then moves on to humans. Yawn... Give me a break. In the original we didn't need to know about Michael's upbringing because it's very clearly stated he was born evil. It's the whole nature vs nurture debate and Rob Zombie takes the nurture route to ill effect.<br /><br />Rob Zombie also seems to have a fascination with white trash and excessive vulgarity. I don't know, maybe Zombie think dropping an F-bomb every few minutes adds authenticity to the script. Another fail!<br /><br />This remake is boring, lacks suspense, does not illicit a single moment of fear, and does not have a single character you care about. The original had all of that. Add this to the long list of Hollywood horror remakes that had no business being remade and are as forgettable as a fart in the wind (and smell as bad).</p></body></html>

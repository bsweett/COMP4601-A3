Multiply all those by two and you get the result: X2.  The characters are more developed, the action tighter and more gripping and the story more  compelling.  This is a truly statisfying thriller.  The best performance in the movie is a tie: I would have to give that honor to Hugh Jackman again for his evolution as Wolverine, Brian Cox as the sinister, mutant-hating Col. Stryker, Ian McKellan for the wicked Magneto and surprisingly Alan Cumming as the religious Nightcrawler.  The movie starts off with a bang as Nightcrawler attempts to assinate the President in a headspinning opening sequence.  The film moves from there, held together by the stern and tight direction of Bryan Singer and a meatier script where original writer David Hayter gets aid from two other wirters, who help develop the characters more and give the movie a healthy dose of humor.  The climax is an extended sequence at Alkalai Lake, where special effects and an atmosphere of  impending doom take over leaving you leveled from it.  Unless you have been living under a rock for the past month, you know X2 has been coming, and it was well worth the hype.  An action movie with a brain, X2 will leave in awe.</p></body></html>

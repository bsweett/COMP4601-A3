<meta name="summary" content="Special Edition vs. Collector's Edition"></head><body><p>So, if you already own the previous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305949980">The Nightmare Before Christmas (Special Edition)</a> is it worth double dipping for this new version and what is new? The good news is that with the exception of a DTS soundtrack and director Henry Selick's solo commentary track, everything from the previous edition has been included in this one.<br /><br />Disc one includes a new audio commentary by producer Tim Burton, director Henry Selick, and music designer Danny Elfman. They were recorded separately and then edited together. Burton talks about the classic animated holiday TV specials that made a huge impression on him. Elfman claims that this is his favourite collaboration with Burton and talks about how he got involved. There is a significant amount of overlap from the numerous featurettes included on this set.<br /><br />A new extra is "What's This? Jack's Haunted Mansion Holiday Tour," which takes you through a haunted mansion ride based on the film. The attention to detail and decor is fantastic, done in Gothic fashion. You can also take the tour with a trivia subtitle track imparting all kinds of factoids. Also included is a featurette examining how they added the Nightmare Before Christmas style to the classic Haunted Mansion design.<br /><br />Also new is "Tim Burton's Original Poem," narrated by none other than veteran genre actor Christopher Lee. This provided the original inspiration for the film. Lee's great voice narrates over evocative concept art.<br /><br />"The Making of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas" takes us through various stages of the production, including the music, storyboards, art direction, and animation. It provides a detailed look at all of the work that went into creating the film and the challenges of stop motion animation.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with "Frankenweenie," a short film Burton directed in 1984. He offers a new introduction and mentions that work has begun on a feature-length stop motion animated film. Shot in gorgeous black and white, it's about a young boy named Vincent (Barret Oliver) who decides to resurrect his dead dog Sparky a la Dr. Frankenstein. Shelley Duvall and Daniel Stern play his very Leave It To Beaver-esque parents.<br /><br />"Vincent" is an animated short film that Burton made early in his career about a young boy who idolizes Vincent Price, who, incidentally, narrates the story. It has a wonderful, Expressionistic look reminiscent of early silent horror films.<br /><br />Also included are three deleted storyboards and four animated sequences introduced by Selick. They feature sequences that didn't make the final cut, some were never animated. Selick explains that they were cut for reasons of time and pacing.<br /><br />"The World's of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas" explores the characters that inhabit Christmas Town, Halloween Town, and the Real World with all sorts of character designs, animation tests and concept art. It allows you to see the various incarnations of these beloved characters.<br /><br />"Storyboards-to-Film Comparison" takes a look at a scene from the film and allows you to watch it simultaneously with the corresponding storyboards.<br /><br />Finally, there are "Posters and Trailers," a collection of poster art, a teaser trailer and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you own the previous Special Edition, it's not really worth the double dip unless you really a devoted fan of this film. If this is your first time purchasing this film on DVD, then get Collector's Edition which has everything you could possibly want.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="8,000 Miles in South America: Portrait as a Young Traveller"></head><body><p>First, I must say 'The Motorcycle Diaries' might be off-putting for some of you as it is the portrait of 'Che' Guevara, the revolutionalist.  Thankfully, the film shows the young days of him in 1952, before he flies to Cuba.  There is a political undercurrent in the film, but it is no socialist message or whatever message from the director Walter Salles ('Central Station') or the co-executive producer Robert Redford.<br /><br />Back then, 52 years ago, Ernest Guevara is a medical student living in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who decides to travel around the South America, with his friend Alberto.  They ride on a big, old motercycle, and leaves the city to head for the north, without making any detailed plans for the travel.  They were very young -- Ernest 23, Albelto 30.  And they know that the experience would change their life, and as it turns out, is does, perhaps more than they expected.<br /><br />The film follows almost exactly the route of their 8,000 miles travel (and shot in the story's time order).  You know, the name of 'road movie' should be applied to this kind of film, which conveys the humid air of the rivers, the snowy road of Chile, and the moutanious land and the ruined city in Peru.  To watch the film is to feel the life of the places, and this is the best thing you can find in 'The Motorcycle Diaries.'<br /><br />During the travel, as you see, Guevara undergoes a spiritual change, witnessing the poverty of the exploited people.  As I said before, the film does NOT show much of this side, for considering the many facts about the complex history of South America, it is a tricky business to include politics.  The film basically remains personal -- personal accounts of the travelling, which changed one youth's mind.  As to the results of the changes, the opinions would naturally divide.<br /><br />Gael Garcia Bernal ('And Your Mother Too') gives a convincing image as Guevara while Rodrigo de la Serna from Argentina is equally effective as Albelto.  Though Mia Maestro plays the sweetheart of Guevara, and pretty impressive, the film is about the two men, one of whom is still remembered in the history.  What happened to the other person, you will see at the end of the film.<br /><br />The film, I am afraid, tends to admire these two travellers (who often talk like womanizers, but the film never shows their actual deeds).  And the film which exceeds 2 hours is very episodic.  But the sense of youth, exuberant all over, cannot be denied.  For that alone, 'The Motorcycle Diaries' is worth your time.</p></body></html>

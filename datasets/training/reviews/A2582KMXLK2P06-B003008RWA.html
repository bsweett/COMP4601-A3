I knew America's health care system was screwed up, but I had no idea it was actually THIS bad, especially compared to the rest of the countries around the world.  I was aware people were driving across America's borders to get access to Canada's better system, and I was even aware the good people of England had a government that was more willing to lend a helping hand to the people than the American one.  I also knew the relationship between America and France was never that great (though personally, I love the French and the people there even though I have no relation to the country).<br /><br />This "documentary" (or whatever you want to call it) did a really amazing job showing us, from many different views and sources, that America doesn't do enough to care about the peoples medical problems.  That's the main point of the movie, and I think you'll find yourself paying attention to everything the film has to offer.  In fact, I KNOW you well, because the film tells the problems and stories of each person (or family) so WELL that you can't help but keep watching it to find out what happens.<br /><br />The greatest part was the ending where a certain unique set of people got on a boat and travelled across the ocean to... I won't reveal this part, so you have something to completely shock you.  Just a great great job this film showed all of us</p></body></html>

My opinion is my own and I hold no ill feeling to those that enjoyed this movie.  In fact I enjoyed it myself for the most part, but in my opinion, I walked from this movie with nothing.  It was entertaining to see how the movie progressed.  The story that unfolded backward was ingenious, but rough getting started.  The performances were excellent, as was the script.  Guy Pearce, Cary-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano all carry the movie so well.  My problem is that the entire movie gets you to sympathize with the character and by the end, you're not sure what to think.  I don't want to give much away by saying anymore.  The movie is obviously leaning toward being artistic, and that's fine.  And I do know something about art, I was an art major in college.  I guess my beef is that the movie is dark and down in it's tone, and many people will not find it entertaining in that respect.  Movies in general are supposed to entertain and with that said, if you don't find dark, moody, twisted and surreal entertaining, you probably won't find this all that much fun to watch.  Myself, I tend to sit on the fence between artistic and entertaining and this movie leans too much toward artistic.</p></body></html>

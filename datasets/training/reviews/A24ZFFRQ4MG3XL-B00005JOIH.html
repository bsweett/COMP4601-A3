I don't want to sit and analise a movie through and through, so I'm not going to write about the direction or the score or stuff like that.<br /><br />I believe this to be very close to the truth (there were a few differences from what I can remember about what I learnt of this topic in history).  Several teams were sent within Europe for revenge killings, but anyway ... Eric Bana was excellent in this.  His accent was down perfectly, and you could see he was a conflicted guy.  He was glad to get revenge, but yet he did things he thought were beyond him as a human being and he worried for his family.  The determination in his eyes was obvious but there was sadness too.  When he heard his baby on the phone for the first time and he broke down, that was heart-wrenching.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic movie that doesn't go into major depth about the actual Munich games themselves, but the aftermath of Israel making those responsable pay.  From the real footage of coverage on news tv (with Peter Jennings voice) to the final scene, I really enjoyed this great movie and I barely noticed that it was in fact 2 hours and 40 something minutes.  I highly recommend this.</p></body></html>

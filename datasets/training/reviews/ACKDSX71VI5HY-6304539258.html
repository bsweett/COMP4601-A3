<meta name="summary" content="By any name or in any form, "Star Wars: Episode IV-A New Hope" is the best movie in the entire "Star Wars" series"></head><body><p>AUTHOR'S NOTE: Though this package includes an updated cut of the film, I will review the original version of it.  Spoilers will follow.<br /><br />REVIEW<br /><br />This is it.  The 1977 original film(paired with an 'enhanced' version of same).  Starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Sir Alec Guinness, "Star Wars: Episode IV-A New Hope" is a powerful and landmark film for generations.<br /><br />The story is a model of simplicity that suggests a multitude of intricacies and hidden meanings.  At bottom, the young man Luke Skywalker forms an uneasy partnership with a shifty ally named Han Solo to rescue a princess.  The galaxy is in the grip of a murderous Empire, led by a faceless and cruel master foot soldier named Darth Vader.  Vader is one of the great villains in popular film, in this film brought to life onscreen by two people.  James Earl Jones' voice is deep and rich, yet also icy-cold when and where it needs to be.  David Prowse wears Vader's immaculate black suit very convincingly.  Luke, Han, and Princess Leia  must manage their egos and grapple with individual responsibility and personal loss to hope to defeat the powerful dark forces, which also include a sea of white-armored StormTroopers and a ruthless evil bureaucrat played by Peter Cushing.<br /><br />The script carries a level of detail and maturity that is missing from every single prequel.  It is here that George Lucas massages the idea of lightsaber battles doubling as psychological revelations and exposition.  The dialogue between Sir Alec Guinness and James Earl Jones during a pivotal lightsaber battle is exemplary for dropping tantalizing clues at a shared past history between their characters.  The Force isn't an underdeveloped joke but an appropriate metaphor for religion and, most especially, spirituality.  Specifically, an intriguing rivalry develops between Obi Wan (Ben) Kenobi, and Han Solo.  Performances are uniformly excellent, with special mention for Sir Alec Guinness in an Oscar-nominated turn as Obi Wan (Ben) Kenobi.<br /><br />If at all possible, see this movie and its immediate sequels "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" before any of the prequel movies.  This is a legendary movie, telling an engrossing story buttressed by one of John Williams' finest musical scores. The movie also features Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Peter Mayhew as the robot twosome C-3PO and R2-D2, respectively, and Solo's large hairy growling co-pilot Chewbacca.  I love this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sometimes the life brings you strange surprises!"></head><body><p>Three previous references around the memories and the vanished youth have been made with remarkable success. The first one was the famous cult movie "The swimmer" in 1968 with Burt Lancaster, "The man who loved women" with Oskar Werner of Francois Truffaut of 1977, and  "The night of Varennes" of Ettore Scola with Marcello Mastroianni in 1981.<br /><br />This is every penetrating film to watch; it talks about absences, of vanished illusions and disappointments, a retrospective journey in search of certain clues in order to restore or rebuilt certain unfitted pieces.<br /><br />Back into our memories, there is not so much to find: the people we loved and ourselves change according the interests and the years.<br /><br />But perhaps, the most interesting aspect to remark is the visible existential boredom of this living wreck, who is forced to initiate a desperate and troubling search of a teenager, product of love affair.<br /><br />The urban jungle: airports, airplanes, buses and mails, filled of empty words without importance, seem to accent still more the vast silence underlined by inexpressive dialogues; trying to find a door exit that leads to nowhere; old love adventures: All those women of his past intend to live or survive and somehow represent an extension of his ego: Sharon Stone, a very attractive widow with a daughter named Lolita (a posthumous homage to Vladimir Nabokov' s novel and Kubrick's film); a mind reader of animals; an unhappy and  narrow-minded wife and an outlaw woman who lives in the suburbs conform a mirror image of himself.<br /><br />The incisive and corrosive shot is implacable: five intersections, five women, five fingers that represent the hand of fate. The film possesses a visible dark poetic flight; the process of edition itself is part of the narrative speech.<br /><br />Two points to remark: the central personage  was extremely flat; Bill Murray is simply an extension of the previous character in "Lost in translation" (I think about Jeremy Irons who looked perfect for this role) and second: Jarmush is not Antonioni. All of us who have watched his artistic trajectory know about his concerns in Mystery train.</p></body></html>

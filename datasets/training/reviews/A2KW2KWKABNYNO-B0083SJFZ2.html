Sure, the original was good for whoever watched it growing up as a kid in the 80s, but by today's standard the movie is little more than a joke. Fortunately, this film will be relevant for much longer than the original, and Sam Worthington does a much better job than Harry Hamlin.<br /><br />The story follows the same basic premise of the original, with a few tweaks, so it's still an ancient road-trip movie to save the local princess, except this time the film adds a heavy amount of more motivation for Perceus. This time, he's driven by revenge, and his desire to be more man than God. And in this sense, while the story take a little bit too much of the screen time, and there are lulls, the story does a serviceable job creating a cohesive narrative that moves from setpiece to setpiece. The characters are a bit less serviced, and by the time the movie is finished you only really get to know Perseus. Thus when a character dies, you're a lot less inclined to care, since there's a great disconnect between the emotion of the film and its audience. Thus, for me at least, it was simply about the action.<br /><br />And the action is pretty good. Since the larger creatures are just so fantastical it was hard for me to get into those scenes as much, but anytime Sam Worthington has a sword I'm happy. But still, the Medusa scene is one of the film's highlights, and apart from the fact that he looks like a sea monster version of Godzilla, the Kraken does provide a lot of great destruction. Plus, it gives the line that will forever live in the annals of film history in, "RELEASE THE KRAKEN!"<br /><br />Overall, Clash of the Titans is a mostly satisfying B-movie action matinee, and a great way to kill an afternoon. It may have its problems apart from the action, and I'm not exactly thrilled at a possible sequel, it was a mostly enjoyable two hours, and that's all I can ask from a movie nowadays.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A powerful real-time recreation of 9/11 and United Flight 93"></head><body><p>I watched "United 93" a week after watching "Flight 93" again and while I have no problem with multiple tellings of the same story, it is interesting to compare and contrast the two films to better appreciate what is happening in this one.  Both films begin with the terrorist hijackers saying their morning prayers, a grotesque irony that continues to fuel the conflict between radical Islamic fundamentalists and the West.  But at that point writer-director Paul Greengrass sets a different tone for this theatrical film because we do not see any of the passengers and crews at their homes.  Instead we get to Newark Airport and the pilots and flight attendants walk on board the doomed flight, while the terrorists and passengers gather in the terminal.  In "Flight 93" we saw the names on the tickets of the passengers as they went through the final checkpoint, but in this film Greengrass makes no effort to clearly establish names (unless you turn on the subtitles, then names are identified when characters speak off camera).  You may know enough about the flight to recognize which character is Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett, Mark Bingham, or any of the others, but their individuality is not necessary to the story being told.  Greengrass talks about it being a collective experience and that is clearly his approach to telling the story.<br /><br />For me the most memorable parts of "Flight 93" were with the family members on the ground who were giving information and support to the passengers on the plane.  In "United 93" we never see or hear those family members, so the two films compliment each other in that regard.  What Greengrass offers it is place is the air traffic controlling system dealing with the hijackings, focusing on the inability to comprehend what was going on and the confusion as the system tried to catch up with events.  While he hired actors and actresses that would not be easily recognizable to viewers for everyone on United 93, Greengrass got several of the people at the FAA, the air traffic control systems, and even with the U.S. military, to play themselves.  Of course we do not recognize any of them, but the verisimilitude is from their language and their reactions, because what is ultimately important here is that Greengrass is not trying to explain the events of 9/11.  Instead, he is trying to recreate them and to depict the confusion rather than indicting or excusing it.  I think Greengrass makes it clear that even as the bits and pieces of key information emerge as to what is going one, that there was nothing that could be done for the simple reason that events that were unfolding were beyond imagination.  It is not until the second plane hits the second tower that the obvious connection led to the ultimate realization.<br /><br />The use of nonprofessional actors, the refusal to even identify let alone establish key characters, and the improvisational nature of the production, all give "United 93" a documentary feel.  Actually, the more I think about it I would amend that to be that the film lacks a lot of what we would expect in a Hollywood dramatization, so that it does not seem like a movie.  There is a sense that we are there, which is certainly a key part of documentaries, but that the movie unfolds in real time gives it much more of a sense of immediacy.  Technical jargon is being bandied about my lots of people, without ever bothering to explain what it all means, adding to the sense of confusion.  But we know what is going to happen and so we understand the irony that minutes after United 93 took off from Newark, with the tops of the World Trade Center towers visible out the window past one of the terrorists, when American 11 disappears on the air traffic control radar what has happened.  Not that this intellectual knowledge makes the emotional impact any less, because it is out ability to connect the dots and be ahead of the people we see on the screen that provides a lot of the power of the narrative.  The final act of the film takes place entirely on the airplane, where there is a real sense of how quickly the passengers put together the information, decided to act, and then tried to regain control of the plane.<br /><br />In his commentary track Greengrass gets into much more of the details of what happened that day, as well as emphasizing what he was trying to do with these scenes.  So if you want more of an explanation for what was happening, Greengrass provides that to some degree.  The one new element that stood out for me was the idea that one of the passengers knew how to fly a single engine plane, so that there was the hope that with the pilots dead there was somebody who could land the plan, albeit with a lot of help from ground control.  I am not sure what I think of introducing that element of hope, because one of the key elements of the heroism of these passengers was that stopping the terrorists from their objective (certainly either the White House or more probably the Capitol building), was as important as trying to regain control of the plane.<br /><br />While this film does not show the families of the passengers, there is an hour-long featurette on the families and the making of "United 93," so they are present on the DVD as well.  There are also memorial pages for all of the passengers and crew, posted by family members (arranged alphabetically by first name, in another nice touch).  Finally, there is a trailer for the Academy Award Winning Short Documentary "Twin Towers."  What you will not find here are any deleted scenes, although Greengrass talks about an alternative opening sequences set in Afghanistan.  It makes sense that a film told in real time would not have deleted scenes, but we know that there were alternate takes because of the improvisational nature of the film, so I want to applaud Greengrass for putting together his final cut and sticking with it.</p></body></html>

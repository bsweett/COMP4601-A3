It's the opera buffs and the Mozart experts who get annoyed by what they see as the liberties taken with the facts. Which is understandable, but didn't bother me at all. Nor did I worry about the various accents, which didn't seem to matter in the slightest. What this fascinating and extremely interesting movie vividly conveyed to me was something of the life of 18th century Vienna, as well as the beginnings of an understanding of the divinity in classical music. The sound was uplifting, in a way I never really experienced previously. The script was intelligent, the acting excellent. I thought Elizabeth Berridge was extremely endearing in her role as Mozart's wife, even though it may well not have matched the historical reality. It was obvious that many of the characters were, in a sense, caricatures: eg the Emperor, the Court musicians, even Mozart's father, and of course Tom Hulce himself. This really did not matter, either. Murray Abraham's face spoke volumes, and I thought his performance was superlative in the part, as written. One of the main themes of the story, and I thought it was very well explored and demonstrated, was the essential inequality of man: the simple fact is that all men are NOT created equal. This is a truth which Americans, especially and self-evidently, find difficult to accept. Another theme is the evil nature of bureaucracy, and the inevitably devious politics of the salaried employee. Stay in with the boss, and eliminate rivals --- that's the message. A third theme is man's longing for immortality. Why is it conferred on only a select few? It's also a partial truth that those whom the gods love die young.  This film is a mind-opener, whatever the musical perfectionists may say.</p></body></html>

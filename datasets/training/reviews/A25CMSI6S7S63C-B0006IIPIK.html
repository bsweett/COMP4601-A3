<meta name="summary" content="Excellent retro science fiction adventure movie !"></head><body><p>I hadn't watched this in years & well I have to admit, this movie is right up my alley, I very much enjoyed it for many reasons. I love the visualization, the scenery, the atmosphere, the fact that it is a movie based on the Golden Era of movies, as if it was shot in the 1930s, it was like an action adventure film noir meets Jurassic park and the Iron Giant. I loved the giant robots & the dino creatures in this. The story has Jude Law as Sky Captain along with Gwyneth Paltow and Angelia Jolie trying to save the world from a mad scientist. Ok its a little deeper than that, but for me it was the action,all the great scenery of where this chase goes from the city to ice to underwater to the jungle. It was also like an Indiana Jones movie too. It had everything needed to entertain, had a lot of action, acting was fine but these movies are made for non stop thrills and this delivered. I do have a passion for giant monsters,robots and great atmospheric scenery,so if you are the same, I highly recommend this movie. It is a lot of fun and a good mix of genres.</p></body></html>

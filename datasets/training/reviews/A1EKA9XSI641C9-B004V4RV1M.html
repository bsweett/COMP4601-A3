<meta name="summary" content="The Top Zombie Film of All Time"></head><body><p>This is definately the best zombie film ever made, and set the scene for every contemporary zombie movie to come.  By contemporary I mean with zombies that aren't possessed by demons.  Anyway the tension between the characters is excellent, and totally beleiveable and the ending is incredibly realistic for the movie.</p></body></html>

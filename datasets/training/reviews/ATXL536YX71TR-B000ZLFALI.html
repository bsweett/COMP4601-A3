<meta name="summary" content=""Come Together Right Now",but it doesn't!"></head><body><p>Just like the Broadway shows of the last few years that string together songs from certain artists to tell a story (some successfully and many not!),Julie Taymor brings us her discombobulated  ACROSS THE UNIVERSE that is not as horrific as her first film TITUS,but once again,with music,she brings us the 1960's to the screen in only the way that she can;overblown and overstuffed with lavish "visionary" style and underinflated  characters and story.<br />This film sweeps through an Era with Beatles tunes strung together to tell the story of hippies,flower power,War,draft dodging with characters that are drawn from the songs,but not characters that have an identity apart from the songs.There are so many stories going on in Taymor's film and unfortunately,in my view,none of them,especially the love alliance of Lucy and Jude, is developed enough to make me care about anyone.For me this is another example of Taymor's style over substance.<br />As someone who was a teen in the '60's, I went into this film with very high expectations;but Julie Taymor is simply too overwrought with her own "coups des cinemas" that even the Beatles tunes couldn't "COME TOGETHER RIGHT NOW".Her work is a distraction  for which I have no affinity.<br />Many people will thoroughly enjoy this film,butI have finally come to a single conclusion that I do not care for Julie Taymor's work on Broadway,THE LION KING or no THE LION KING, and I do not care for her direction in film.She is a three-time strike out with me!You may all press your unhelpful buttons now.<br />To see a film that chronicles the following 1970's that show results of the 1960 time period I suggest Ang Lee's THE ICE STORM strongly.</p></body></html>

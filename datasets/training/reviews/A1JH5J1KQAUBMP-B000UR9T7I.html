This is a hugely disappointing film, especially after the first two, also from director Sam Raimi, were so good.<br /><br />It's hard to know where to begin.  The Venom subplot seems to have been thrown in as an afterthought, with no attempt whatsoever made to give the character a plausible introduction; it just happens to drop out of space near our hero.  The Sandman's character is wildly erratic; one moment he's a misunderstood man who just wants to help his dying daughter, the next he is vengefully joining forces with Venom to kill Spider-Man, an action that doesn't help his daughter at all.  Harry Osbourne's motivation flip-flops around to meet the requirements of the plot, Peter's dark side is played for laughs, and the angst between Mary Jane and Peter is childish and annoying, with the sadly undeveloped character of Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) merely one more contrived obstacle between them.</p></body></html>

I had a frightening bike ride home that night. I never forgot the opening of the movie, twilight in the graveyard. AMC or some station was showing classic horror films and I only saw bits of pieces of this but I found the crisp back and white and the shaky camera work very beautiful. I consequently purchased the millennium addition and enjoyed every second of it. I still like the beginning the best including the part when she first stumbles upon the house as she is running from the zombies. This movie is very special and has had a profound affect on probably every horror movie made since. Bonuses include 2 cast commentaries, scenes of There's always vanilla(another favorite of mine), commercials from the same production company, as well as some other stuff I can't remember.</p></body></html>

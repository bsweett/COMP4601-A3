<meta name="summary" content="Mulder and Scully would've fared better! *SPOILERS*"></head><body><p>As others have stated, there are too many similarities between this film and an episode of the recently departed "The X-Files": an alien with regenerative powers, mindless government agents, too many chase scenes, dimly lit streets, a cop (Alfre Woodard) that discovers "the truth" a little too late, all frequent elements of the show.<br /><br />Even James Horner's subtle score treads musical ground better covered by "Files" composer Mark Snow.<br /><br />And poor Gary Sinise probably needed to move to television ("CSI: New York").  It's become obvious, as of late, that whatever character he portrays in a film has a hidden agenda.<br /><br />The saving grace of the film is Julianne Moore, an actress that deserves better than this easily "forgotten" film.</p></body></html>

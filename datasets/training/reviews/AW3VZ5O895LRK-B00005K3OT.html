<meta name="summary" content="As Scrumptious as Chocolate itself"></head><body><p>First big suprise with this film was that it was filmed in English language, not French, so there are no subtitles.  I've read that more and more movies are being shot in the English language simply because the potential box office profit is so much huger. Put simply, this is a delightful film which many critics are probably grading downwards because it is &quot;just&quot; a simple story that is simply (but beautifully) told.  I am hardly ready to number myself among them!  Lasse Hallestrom, who first distinguished himself with the marvelous &quot;My Life As A Dog,&quot; knows his way around a film script and with actors and it shows.  Playing much like a fable or fairy tale, Juliette Binoche is a woman, Vianne, who wanders from place to place with her daughter, Anouk, setting up shop as a chocolatier. This time she sets up shop in a peaceful French village in the winter of 1959. Delightful as the love story portion is with the river rat, Gypsy-like Johnny Depp, it is the hilarious war waged on Binoche by the town's mayor, played by Alfred Molina, who will reduce you to complete gut-busting laughter. His wife left him and his inability to deal with that fact fuels a lot of his animosity towards Vianne and the general air of sensual repression he wishes to foster in the village.  All of the villagers are delightful characters and Binoche is pulled into relationships with them.  If you need to brighten up your day, this is the movie to get.</p></body></html>

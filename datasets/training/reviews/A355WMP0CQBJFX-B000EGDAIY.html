<meta name="summary" content="THE GRUDGE IS WICKED GOOD!!"></head><body><p>this movie was a different kind of horror. the kind that grips you and freaks you out a bit. i saw it and i loved it. what's better than a spirit bent on revenge and taking out whoever comes into her domain. takashi did a great thing here. the whole aspect and creating the woman who was to be the grudge. the whole makeup and the hair, and let's not forget that evil stare. her sound effect was memorable. you just can't forget it. sounds like a creaking door. excellent job, scary, and believable. sarah michelle gellar did very well on her part. she really brought this other side of herself out, to play this role. she feels this presence, but she doesn't know why this is happening or who this is. she's on a mission to find out, when she does she has to find a way to destroy it. the grudge is after her, and there's no getting rid of this woman full of rage. the scene where she's coming down the stairs all broken like, loved it. i thought it was a spooky one.</p></body></html>

It is plainly a horrifically done adaption of Christopher Paolini's book by the same name, slashing vital plots into nothingness, showing forced performances by some the best actors of our time (the most noteworthy being John Malkovich), and producing a main character (Eragon played by Edward Speelers) who grows too fast and is rarely sympathetic in the short 104 minutes of the entire film.<br /><br />Note that time: 104 minutes. Chris Paolini wrote Eragon as a sort of epic, brandishing derivative works such as Tolkien's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618640150">The Lord of the Rings</a> series and McCaffrey's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345340248">Dragonriders of Pern</a> stories. But Paolini was only fifteen when he started writing it, so quite a bit of leeway was given to him because of youthful inexperience. He did create an interesting world, but the book was lukewarm at best (in my opinion) yet sparked the imagination of younger readers. Perhaps his book could be considered a gateway to the more in-depth novels by Tolkien, McCaffrey, and the other great fantasy authors. Regardless, his "epic" was slashed to 104 minutes ...although the ending of this movie certainly leaves it open for a sequel even though there's NOTHING on the film radar/horizon to suggest one is coming. Which pretty much leaves this flick dead in the water. Dropping off plots in order to wedge the story into a certain time-frame for a certain audience has proved disastrous time after time. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings movies</a> (178 min., 179 min., and 201 min. respectively), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia</a> (143 min.) and many, many other lengthy films proved this. Although they did make alterations to the literary works, they kept almost all of the plots intact. Of course longer movies mean more costs for the production studio, too.<br /><br />So the first big strike against Eragon is its short length in comparison to the depth the novel gave us.<br /><br />The second is the acting. When the best job is done by a CGI character who's voiced by Rachel Weisz (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EU1PXM">The Constant Gardner</a>), you know there's a problem. Her Saphira voice-over is done well, leaving all the other actors/actresses in the dust. Although Jeremy Irons (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDWKXI">Casanova</a>) does a middlin' job as the old dragonrider Brom, it most certainly isn't his most shining moment on celluloid. Many of his lines are stilted and sound as if he's afraid to use more than five words in a sentence. From here, the acting takes a serious nosedive into oblivion. Newbie Edward Speelers as Eragon is rip-your-eyes-out bad. You can tell he's trying way to hard to make his character empathetic and interesting but the script wouldn't allow it. Sienna Guillory as the magical Arya is practically unknown to the viewer, never letting us know why she, of all people, is carrying something so important through such a dangerous land. Robert Carlyle as the dastardly Duza is probably the most forced evil character you'll ever see, making you laugh at him more than fear him.<br /><br />The best quality within the movie was the CGI. The images were rendered exceptionally well and the dragon Saphira has a very authentic look to her (which was good considering how much time she's onscreen).<br /><br />If you loved Paolini's Eragon novel, you'll probably screech in dismay at this adaption. If you didn't, you'll probably screech in dismay anyway.</p></body></html>

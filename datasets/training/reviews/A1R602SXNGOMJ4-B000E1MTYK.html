<meta name="summary" content="Well Worth The Wait"></head><body><p>I've been waiting a year and a half for this movie and I can tell you that it was Definitely worth the wait! Even though Daniel, Rupert and Emma are much older than 14 (it's pretty obvious) they are so convincing as they learn about their feelings of maturity.  The selection ceremony for the Tri-Wizard tournament was humorous. The look of shock on certain characters faces is unforgettable! The tasks are fun and exciting even though I already knew what was going to happen! I thought that the Yule ball was absolutely spectacular, and Ron's dress robes were awesome! The movie was so well done, I'd have to say that it is the best movie in the series so far!  For fans of the movies, you'll find this installment a little darker, a little grittier, and a little more involving. The characters are growing up and are now facing more adult situations with more adult outlooks.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that so much of the book needed to be cut for time and the movie is still nearly 2 1/2 hours long.  A lot of story and character development isn't there.  But what there is is a great visual treat.  The special effects and the music in the this movie were the best yet! The underwater scenes especially were very well done.  This movie, like many, does have its shortfalls. I believe that Dumbledore was portrayed as a little too intense.  Instead of the benevolent, kind, and good-humored old man I have always loved in the books. As someone that has read the books, I must say another shortfall is that this movie banks on familiarity with the story. Having read the books, I found it very easy to follow, but I could understand how one who has not read the books may feel a bit lost, as some important information was left out and some back-story was left mostly unexplained.<br /><br />All in all I would say this is definitely the best movie in this series so far, and if the next three are on par with this one then I would be content.</p></body></html>

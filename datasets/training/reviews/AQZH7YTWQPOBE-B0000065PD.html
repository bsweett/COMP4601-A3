<meta name="summary" content="Egyptians and Aliens make a surprisingly good movie"></head><body><p>On its face, a movie about aliens enslaving ancient Egyptians could seems more like a failed Sci-Fi Channel idea than a blockbuster hit. Yet, through a mixture of likable characters, exciting action sequences, and strong soundtrack, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000844I8">Stargate</a> is surprisingly good. I hadn't watched it in years, but was pleasantly surprised when I watched it recently that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000844I8">Stargate</a> has held up pretty well all these years. Moreover, I watched the movie with my wife, who is definitely not a fan of sci-fi movies, and she loved it. The movie and plot are pretty accessible to any audience.<br /><br />Some of the special effects look a bit dated. It's not too bad, but I do think it might be worth investing in a special edition and adding better graphics (especially for that desert animal in the beginning). By and large though, the special effects are more than adequate to make the movie work.</p></body></html>

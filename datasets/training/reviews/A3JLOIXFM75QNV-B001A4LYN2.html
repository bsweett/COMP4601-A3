I'm sure all the great and wonderful themes the critics were all raving about is in this movie somewhere, ie: Greed, power, family, etc...However, it's nothing that I haven't seen before.  The movie was longer than it needed to be. The musical score felt incredibly forced and ridiculously over the top. I felt as if it was trying to ring and emotion out of the viewers. Sort of like a horror movie that is only pretending to be scary because of the loud music. That is how I felt watching There Will Be Blood. Except it wasn't scary, or engaging. In fact, for the most part, it was quite boring. Yes, Daniel Day-Lewis is wonderful in this, no question. But a man cannot make a movie. Or at least, not one with a boring premise to begin with. I am not even going to comment on the ending as there are plenty of reviews that feel as I do. I am not going to say that this movie had no significant point, however, for such a long, drawn-out plot, it sure made it diffucult to even care about it.</p></body></html>

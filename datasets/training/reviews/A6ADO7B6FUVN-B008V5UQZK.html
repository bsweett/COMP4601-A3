In addition, he has raised his daughters and son to be well educated in Greek history and what comes from Greece.  His daughter Toula is 30 years old and she is supposed marry a good Greek man and have many Greek children that can carry on the Greek traditions according to Gus.  However, Toula has a different idea of what she wants to do--she wants to go to college and get an education.  In the process, she meets Ian Miller, a non-Greek man who is from an opposite type of family where silence is merry.  This presents some problems for their relationship, since it infuriates Toula's father.  My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a warm and humorous film that in the end provides a happy ending as well as food for the mind.</p></body></html>

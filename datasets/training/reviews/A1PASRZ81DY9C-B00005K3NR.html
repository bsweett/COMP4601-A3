Yes, I loved the build-up of the story from start to the "moment." Don't get me wrong, the build-up leading to the "moment" is skillfully and aesthetically done. But it was the "moment" where Carrie began to go wrong. In fact, I didn't like the editing work because I felt cheated when the "moment" shortly expired. Then, the next thing I know, Carrie walks out of the gymnasium and gets on road where she avoids a car by using her telekinetic powers. The rest of the film didn't help much either. It was hard for me to believe how the characters get dropped out like flies during the "moment." For me, if I had to do the editing work, I would have prolonged the "moment" a little bit longer and just end it right there. That's it. Why ruin a good thing? It's almost a Tarantino with some Peckinpah thrown in. Sissy Spacek gave a nice, soft performance although she was great much of time, but I wanted more screen time from her; I liked the gentle character of Tommy Ross played by William Katt; and the mother played Piper Laurie wasn't bad work, but I prefer Faye Dunaway's Joan Crawford. It was weird seeing John Travolta playing his character because mainly he acted like himself pretty much the whole time. Luckily, he shows real acting when he took on the iconic character Tony Manero. There are plenty of gratuitous nude scenes throughout Carrie, but I wouldn't go as far to say that they were anything that meets the word "sexy." All in all, although I never went to my high school prom since I find it a rubbish idea, Carrie substitutes for it with even acting and nice build-up, but the last fifteen minutes is pretty disappointing for me.</p></body></html>

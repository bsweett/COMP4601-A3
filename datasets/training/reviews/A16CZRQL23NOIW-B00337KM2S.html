<meta name="summary" content="A dramatic comedy!"></head><body><p>It's useless to state this year will not been reminded precisely as a fruitful one in which concerns the movies that have been nominated for the Academy awards. Moreover, if you take a glimpse around the last sixty years, you will be notice how modest has been this season in which the originality and creativity glitter for their absence.<br /><br />The personal record of this executive has been reached: Ten millions miles in the air. But beneath the curious anecdote, there's a lonely man who has wrought a peculiar life philosophy: to live without hindrances or emotional ties.<br /><br />Meanwhile, three facts will make its appearance in order to alterate his habitual way of life: he will meet another female executive who lives a similar life, on the other hand, a young woman tries to follow his steps as executive (but fails in her attempt) and besides, his own sister is going to be married and he is invited for her wedding.<br /><br />The emotional impact of this marriage will make think and reflect about his existential profile, far beyond all the successes and achieved goal.<br /><br />Two previous films have remarked and inspired this one: Lost in Tokyo and Amelie.<br /><br />In sum, a dramatic comedy that in honor to the truth has been overrated, due the proposed idea promised much more. To be honest, the film doesn't match the status to be nominated as Best Film.<br /><br />It's a pleasant movie but nothing else.</p></body></html>

This is not a story about elves, fairies, trolls or any other such mythological beings of lore and legend. It is a coming of age tale about a young boy and girl, Jessie (Josh Hutcherson) and Leslie (Annasophia Robb) who develop a strong friendship centered around a fantasy kingdom of their own making.<br /><br />Synopis: Terabithia lies in the woods adjacent to the homes of best friends Jessie and Leslie. It is just beyond a rushing stream which they traverse by swinging across using an old rope tied to a tree.  The two find this imaginary land a perfect escape from their daily problems revolving around school bullies, family difficulties and just growing up in general. Unfortunately even an imaginary kingdom can only hold out the harshness of reality for so long. The children are about to learn that some lessons in life are more difficult to accept than others.<br /><br />Positives: The cinematography, sets, special effects and music are superior as you'd expect from a Disney feature. The children are also quite charming, especially the talented Annasophia Robb. She will definitely be heard from in the years ahead.  Lest I forget, Zooey Deschanel plays the part of Miss Edmunds their music/art teacher. Zooey's always a plus to anything she's in.<br /><br />Negatives: Due to a rather dubious advertising campaign promoting this film as a fantasy adventure it has targeted an audience much too young for its slow pace and storyline. Further complicating matters, the characterizations portrayed in the movie are a little too stereotypical and one-dimensional to attract many adult fans. These two demographic miscues leave `Bridge to Terabithia' virtually a movie without an audience.<br /><br />Postscript: So if you're looking for a film in the tradition of `The Chronicles of Narnia' or `The NeverEnding Story' be forewarned, this isn't it. On the other hand, if you're in search of something more in keeping with the mood and message of `Pay It Forward' this film's for you.<br /><br />Rating: 3 1/2 Stars.</p></body></html>

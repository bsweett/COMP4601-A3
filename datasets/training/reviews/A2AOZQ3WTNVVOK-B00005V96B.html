While the plot sounds silly, the execution is hilarious.<br /><br />James P. "Sulley" Sullivan, voiced by John Goodman, and Mike Wazowski, voiced by Billy Crystal, are the leaders in obtaining the highest quantities of screams at the factory.  Life seems to be going well for the buddies.  Mike is in love with Celia, voiced by the sultry Jennifer Tilly.  Sulley is the favorite of boss Henry J. Waternoose III, voiced by classy veteran actor James Coburn in one of his last roles.  Life could hardly be better until co-worker Randall Boggs, voiced by Steve Buscemi, leaves a door in the factory and Sulley steps through it to find Boo, as he names the ultimately charming little girl that follows him through the door.<br /><br />What follows is one of the funniest movies of 2001, animated or otherwise.  Pixar Animation did an outstanding job of animated the monsters throughout this film, and the chase scene through the door factory has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Winner of 11 major awards, including an Oscar, and nominated for 29 other awards, this movie has a visual power that will captivate young and old audiences alike.  The two-disc collector's edition includes hours and hours of extras.  As with most two-disc editions, some of the extras were great, some were good, and many I skipped through because I was uninterested.<br /><br />"Monsters, Inc." is a rare family film that is suitable for all but the youngest members of the family.  The animation is superb, the acting is great, and the storyline is creative.  Movies such as these have made Pixar the current leader in animated films.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

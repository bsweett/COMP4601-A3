Bored married man and bored married woman meet; fatal attraction and, then the movie just derails. There is a semblance of chemistry between Jennifer Aniston and Clive Owen but it quickly evaporates.  Clive Owen is married, has a daughter with a chronic illness, bored with his job and his life, meets Jennifer Aniston; married wiht a daughter and too busy husband and an attraction ensues. They meet a couple of times and then one fateful night they go to a hotel. They start to make love when they are interrupted by a man with gun. A beating, a rape and then life starts to fall apart for both of them. Blackmail ensues and then Clive Owen decides he has to do something about this man who is ruining his life. All is not what it seems, and the twists and turns in this movie are out of line.  You become confused and begin to lose interest.<br /><br />The final scene is so out of character that you wonder if this is the same story line or was one juxtaposed to give this movie some life.  Whatever has happened, the movie has taken a final turn that does not make sense. Too bad, both Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston separately are fascinating people. Together they did not make a team. Disappointing.<br /><br />prisrob 7-22-06</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The guy deserved what he got."></head><body><p>This was a fascinating documentary about a nature lover who lived alongside grizzly bears for 13 years.  Although his life ended sadly, I felt up to a point, he deserved what he got.  To me, he seemed like a self-absorbed jerk throughout the entire movie.  He refers to himself in the 3rd person ("Timothy rules!").  That is one sign of a egotistical maniac.  His behavior was really immature and childish, and the more I watched the video, the less sympathy I had for him.  He did not realize that nature is indifferent to anything and everything.  Nature will try to survive regardless of who or what it has to swallow.</p></body></html>

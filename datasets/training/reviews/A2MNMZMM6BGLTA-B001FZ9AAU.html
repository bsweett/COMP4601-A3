Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark. It is the perfect blend of comedy, and a movie that stays true to the comic. The special effects are great! Jeff Bridges does a great job as the villian and I must say that the bald head looks cool as hell on him. Even Pepper Potts is good. I am not a fan of Paltrow but she is great in this part!<br /><br />GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!</p></body></html>

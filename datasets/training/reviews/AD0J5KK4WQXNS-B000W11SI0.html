<meta name="summary" content="The Robinson Crusoe of the Nazi Holocaust."></head><body><p>The Pianist is an amazing film on all counts and could well be the best film from Polanski and his most personal work to date. The best way to describe The Pianist is by sticking Robinson Crusoe in the middle of a Nazi Holocaust.<p>Holocaust films are always striving to get at you emotionally by creating good guy bad guy type scenarios. The truth is that The Pianist is not really concentrating too much on delivering a Holocaust movie. Instead it aims for telling the tale of a feeble piano player trying to survive Polish Nazi occupation. The premise is a simple one. The Pianist is not like his brothers, sisters or friends who are all actively seeking ways to rebel against the Nazis. Instead he is just trying to stay alive in order to engage in his one passion in life - playing the piano.<p>Basically the film starts with Wladyslaw Szpilman (An amazing Adrian Brody!) learning with his family that the Nazis are making decrees against the Jews. You see the elevating intensity of a rich family suddenly being relocated to a confined Jewish district and then the horrors start to build up from simple street provocations to full out mass murders in public view. The buildup is powerful and horrifying. The things you see in this film will make you angry and mad, but the Holocaust is not really what is at the heart of this film.<p>Wladyslaw is just a Piano player and can do very little to stop what is going on. He does not wish to join any revolution and tries to stay out of the way being hospitable and polite when he can. As the world collapses around him he finds his life spared from the concentration camps only to be catapulted from the frying pan into the fire as he tries to survive in solitary either with the help of Jewish sympathizers or by living among the rumbled ruins in search of food. Seeing the world through the eyes of Wladyslaw is what this film is all about and Brody gives his best performances when he is alone with nobody to talk too or anything to say. Just seeing him stagger around in search of food is like nothing you have seen before or will see again.<p>Sure the encounter with the Nazi commander at the end is a little hard to believe and it does border on the fantastic as if to create a musical plot twist for our pivotal character but then again it is based on a true story and these things did happen so it is believable in an unlikely sort of way. <p>At its core, The Pianist is a survival movie about one man trying to last among the rubbles and ruins. At times it is surreal and at others it is devastatingly emotionally potent. This is one of the best films of the 21st century and you should certainly not miss out on seeing this drama. The set designs, plot, script, costumes, acting and action sequences are all on top form. For realism it is simply unparalleled by any film of its kind.<p>Highly Recommended.</p></body></html>

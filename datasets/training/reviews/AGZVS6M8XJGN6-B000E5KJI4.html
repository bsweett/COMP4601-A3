<meta name="summary" content="The human side is the key of this handsomely mounted motion picture..."></head><body><p>In Wolfgang Petersen's "Troy," the Aegean Sea never looked so gorgeous and the clashing of swords and smashing of shields never have been heard so powerful and clear...<br /><br />The city of Troy is one of the few that has not fallen under Agamemnon's influence, a fact that irritates the fearsome commander to no end... From the part of the Greeks there is no love at all... Only ambition, revenge and conquest, with a yearning for power, wealth and victory... From the part of the Spartans there is King Priam (Peter O'Toole) who is seen old, powerless but kindly, not even blaming Helen for all his personal losses...<br /><br />Eric Bana as a noble Hector is the only truly compelling character of Peterson's epic motion picture... Not even his courage was enough to restrain the savage anger of his egotistic adversary... But his tormented loyalty to his country and to his family is to admire and contemplate... Hector is happily married, and he has just become father of a little son and would actually like to rest a little bit and enjoy his family...<br /><br />Orlando Bloom is lost as Paris, the prince and the lover... His passion has no limit... He is a free spirit with a love to beauty despite his admirable drive to pursue his dreams no matter the odds...<br /><br />Helen (Diane Kruger) escapes back to Troy and gives the tyrant Agamemnon (Brian Cox) the excuse he needs to reach the beaches of the city... She is the beautiful face of the odious Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) who swore not to rest till he destroy Troy once and for all...<br /><br />Achilles (Brad Pitt) makes a more human lover than a mighty warrior... He only fights when motivated but beware when he is furious and outraged... His hatred for the malevolent conqueror Agamemnon is deliciously to look at and consider...<br /><br />Rose Byrbe (Briseis), a priestess and cousin to Hector, is moving in her willing to give up everything as long as her deadly Greek warrior lives...<br /><br />Odysseus (Sean Bean) provides the Greeks enough soldiers to conquer Troy with terrible consequences...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kinnear and Carrell lead strong cast; Arkin's good, but Oscar should have gone to Murphy"></head><body><p>There's some very well-conceived and well-executed comedic moments in 'Little Miss Sunshine.'  I found myself laughing out loud many times.  I enjoy Toni Collette in pretty much everything.  She's good here, but the standouts are Greg Kinnear (his 'Nine Steps' Tony Robbins-wannabe shtick is great stuff) and Steve Carrell.  From 'Talk Soup' and 'The Daily Show' respectively, these guys have turned themselves into wonderful actors.  In fact, the movie's best acting comes from Kinnear, especially in the scene where he sits in the audience at the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant and realizes - with growing concern - the probable talent gap between the contestants and what he imagines his daughter Olive is about to bring to the stage.  [But even he can't imagine what Olive has in store, although her music choice - 'Super Freak' - and her grandfather's taste in reading material give a pretty clear indication.]<br /><br />Despite Alan Arkin's fine work here, I still think Eddie Murphy got totally jobbed out of his Oscar.  Arkin's role is rather abbreviated here (for reasons that are obvious to anyone who's watched the film).  In contrast, Murphy's take on James 'Thunder' Early in 'Dreamgirls' is a tour de force.  If you can't win an Oscar for that performance, there's just something wrong with the process.</p></body></html>

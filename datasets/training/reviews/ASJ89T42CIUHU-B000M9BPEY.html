His wife (Jessica Lange) remains humored by her husband's fantasy life but is troubled that her son cannot seem to warm up to this extraordinary man. Edward's son Will Bloom (Billy Cudrup) has grown weary of his father's inability to deal with reality and is sick of hearing about oversized fish, perfect Southern towns, spectacular circuses, Siamese twins, glass eyes that see the future, haunted forests and gentle giants who don't exist. But upon returning home for his father's final days Will warms up to the possibility of his father's life as he sees it. With flash backs to Edward's youth (played by Ewan McGregor) all the tales seem come to new life.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie that brings an intimacy back to a family torn apart by false hopes and scattered communication. It shows the despair a child experiences when shadowed from the truth and the distance a father creates by telling tall tales hoping to make himself appear more than he seems. But it also shows the ties of a family never quite severed and so close to the core. With brilliant imaginative scenes Tim Burton has created an adult fairy tale for the ages that can appeal to children as well. This is Burton's most mature venture and he rises to the occasion managing to combine sentiment beside fantasy with great ability. At times touching this film also contains a touch of horror and moments of comical relief while maintaining integrity to the original book written by Daniel Wallace. Only Tim Burton could have managed to bring this book to life. For anyone who has experienced that bedside chat with a dying loved one or anyone who wished for those precious moments this movie will tug at your heart strings and leave you weeping. But in the end what is a tall tale? In a world of differences trying to understand another's reality may seem blurry at times but imagine the possibilities if we allow others to envision our most precious dreams.....Tim Burton opens up that other world so grab your pole and go fishing!</p></body></html>

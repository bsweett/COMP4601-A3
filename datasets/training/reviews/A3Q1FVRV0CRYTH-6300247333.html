<meta name="summary" content="Sometimes shot-for-shot equals scare-for-scare"></head><body><p>For my 666 review I decided to take on the remake of `The Omen' which could turn itself into a horrible mistake for anyone who's the slightest bit superstitious, but luckily I'm not even remotely so I'll sleep more than fine tonight.<br /><br />This remake has received an awful lot of flak right off the bat for following a pattern similar to that of the 1998 `Psycho' remake, following the original script almost to the T raising the question, `why make a remake if it's shot for shot the original?'  Well, to answer that question it's for money.  A glossy new remake, regardless if the dialog is identical, will at least look far better than any film made in the 70's and in that respect `The Omen' succeeds with flying colors (one reviewer even mentioned his love of the colors used in this film and with that I must concur).<br /><br />As far as the complaint that young Fitzpatrick isn't quite scary enough, come on, we can't all be as creepy as say Cameron Bright (who I wish was younger and could have tackled this role...that kid is so freaking creepy).  But regardless, little Davey does a decent job at playing possessed.  Better suited for her role was the original Rosemary herself Mia Farrow who was excellently cast and proved to be the biggest highlight of the film.  As far as parents Stiles and Schreiber are concerned, I actually feel they deserve props for this, especially Julia who plays the troubled mother perfectly.  I really wish she would get the role of a lifetime that really takes her over the edge of stardom.  She's certainly talented enough.<br /><br />So bottom line is, while so many have already pointed out the un-necessity of this film, `The Omen' delivers enough scares and enough solid acting to warrant a watch through, and while it's not perfect and it may not be better than the original, it's no worse.</p></body></html>

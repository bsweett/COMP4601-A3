<meta name="summary" content="Shrek and Fionna grows with time"></head><body><p>Shrek the Third is not just an animation. It is a warm, hilarious movie that sees the growing up of Shrek and Fionna. While Shrek the original is about true romance, the Second is about meeting the parents and the Third is about getting ready to be a parent.<br /><br />In terms of characters, the duo of the donkey and the cat, royal to Shrek as always, is fun to watch. Prince Charming has a wicked voice (Rupert Everett) and such beautiful hair! The greater emphasis of the girl power and action scenes - Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty - produce even more humour and excitement. In terms of animation, Princess Fionna is more beautiful than ever. Somehow her green face, big nose and plus size combined exudes real beauty. Her frown, her gaze and smile grab attention. In terms of storyline, there are gripping moments that may result in a tear or two - the last words of King Frog, the bond between Shrek and a young King-in-waiting, the downfall of Prince Charming.<br /><br />I can't say Shrek the Third outdo the previous two. All I can say is that it is a natural extension of its predecessors, providing as much entertainment and warmth. It feels good to see how the characters grow up and bond together. In terms of technical development, it also evolves to be more advanced and fluid. Prince Charming and the Queen mother can pass as real people if one doesn't look closely. You won't come out of the cinema disappointed.</p></body></html>

He's tired of life in the Central Park Zoo and wants to see what life is like in the wild.  When he escapes, his three friends try to chase him down and bring him back.  And while Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) do catch up with him, it doesn't turn out quite as planned.  Instead, all four of them find themselves headed to Africa.  Will they survive when they get there?<br /><br />I normally steer clear of Dreamworks Animation movies because I find them pale imitations of the Disney Pixar films they are attempting to rip off.  But the previews for the sequel looked so entertaining, I had to give this one a try.  I should have stayed away.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few amusing moments.  I laughed at several of the movie spoofs.  But that was about it.  The story was boring.  The characters had so much potential.  Instead, they went with the easy joke (read bathroom humor) and didn't play out the jokes the premise could have set up.  As many have said, the group of commando penguins are the funniest things in the film, but they don't have nearly enough screen time to make much difference.<br /><br />Then there's the issue of voice casting.  Yes, most of the cast did fine.  But I couldn't get Ross from Friends out of my head whenever Melman had a line.  Trust me, that was very distracting.<br /><br />Many have dismissed Disney's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G75AZC">The Wild</a> as a rip off of this film.  That's a shame because, for my money, it is the far superior film.  Stay away from this one and get a copy of that film.  Instead of staring at the TV screen, you'll be laughing from start to finish.</p></body></html>

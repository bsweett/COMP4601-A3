<meta name="summary" content="Into a nightmarish vortex..."></head><body><p>"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is directed by Sidney Lumet (Serpico, The Verdict, Dog Day Afternoon). Lumet uses a structure of story telling whereby the events before and after a robbery are told like an eddy in time that swirls around the disastrous pivotal event of the robbery. Time is used like a net that entangles events together as we learn of the circumstances that lead the two brothers, played by Ethan Hawke and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, to plot the robbery. Through Lumet's mesmerizing directing we follow these brothers into the vortex of their greedy self created nightmare as it also drags those they love into this hole of despair.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A bad day at the office"></head><body><p>These two guys have one incredibly off day trying to best each other in Manhattan as they play out a struggle over conflicting goals and desires, each inadvertently sabotaging the other. Very smart script here. It builds as each incident combines to gather steam towards a finale that, while predictable, at least comes after some great dialogue by all concerned. No, it's not the least bit credible, if you stop and think about it. But it is a movie after all, so we suspend our cynical views and watch the steamroller go on to conclusion. The end is a little ambiguous. But this movie is about the journey.</p></body></html>

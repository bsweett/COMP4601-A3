Quentin Tarantino movies are not for the diluted sissys who'd rather watch a romantic comedy. All right? &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; started a new trend in Hollywood with the unorthodox storytelling and rich dialogue. Although there's enough violence in the movie, the blood is not glorified. Not every other scene has somebody doing something gruesome. Are you listening? The movie is a classic and is original. Who's the mole of the group? You'll have to see.</p></body></html>

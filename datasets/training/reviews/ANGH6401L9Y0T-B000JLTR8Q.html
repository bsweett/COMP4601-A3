Night Shyamalan in Wikipedia before I started this review. I found he has done some other films, only a couple were at all successful: The Sixth Sense, Signs and The Village. Apparently his style is not all that Hollywood (and especially Disney Studios, from which he has broken away) would want. But he's an Indian-American brought up in the Philadelphia Main Line, a wealthy suburban region I know something about from my life in Pennsylvania. Most of his films have been made in and around Philadelphia.<br /><br />The Lady in the story is a water sprite, not a mermaid. She has legs. Very pretty ones, in fact. As the opening legend (even ahead of the title credits) tells us, the water people have tried for years to contact humans, with whom they were once in close harmony, to help us with our spiritual development. They do this at great personal risk, but they feel it is essential.<br /><br />Our particular Lady, whose name is Story, shows up in the swimming pool of a rather odd apartment building, populated by a truly unique cast of characters. They are of different races, different temperaments, religions and lack of same, and so on. The manager stutters terribly except when he's in the presence of Story. Story's purpose is to be seen by a writer who has an important destiny. This writer is played by Shyamalan himself, who is a very charming young man. He has been writing a book which has not come together yet, but which is a series of fragments about life and philosophy and politics and such. When he sees Story, he is able to see clearly how to put the book together. She tells him about the future of the book, and his own personal future as well.<br /><br />It turns out Story's story corresponds to a traditional bed-time story remembered by the old Chinese lady who lives in the building with her extremely modern daughter. Using the daughter as interpreter, the traditional tale is told, with enough clues to realize that the inhabitants of this building did not come together by accident, but specifically because they are destined to help Story to get back home.<br /><br />How they figure out their individual roles in the drama needed to get Story safely back to her home, and what they each discover about themselves and each other in the process, makes a charming tale that makes a very important point. We all have a role to play, a purpose to being alive, and the people around us in our lifetime are there for a reason. We come together in order to support one another's spiritual development.<br /><br />As I was thinking about this, I got a message from one of my favorite people on the Internet, telling me she had just been thinking about the value of the circle of friends she has made through the Internet, and sounding very much like she had just been listening to my brain, or I to hers.<br /><br />Perhaps in the modern world these circles exist in hyperspace as well as locally, eh?<br /><br />I have to give this movie three stars. I'd like to give it four, but it does seem just a little too precious at times, and a wee bit contrived. Only a wee bit, but that keeps it from a full four stars.</p></body></html>

Everything is bright and sunny, with him riding around an isolated NYC with his dog.  After a while though, his alarm on his watch starts going off, and he heads home, while the dark starts creeping up he gets in and closes off his house, windows and all.  You then hear horrible, demonish sounds outside.  You get it that this is a nightly routine for him. You do get a couple of great scenes that are scary in this, but the movie really plays up on his sense of isolation and aloneness. I think the reason my husband didn't like it was because of the time it took to get established.  I don't think the story would have worked had he just all of a sudden started with the monsters, it had to tell what his life was to that point, and how it started to change.  Anyway, pretty good movie if you feel like seeing one!</p></body></html>

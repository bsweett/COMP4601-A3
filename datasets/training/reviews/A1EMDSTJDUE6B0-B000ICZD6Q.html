<meta name="summary" content="Good Values"></head><body><p>This is one of those films that reinforces good values and "what life is all about". I like the way it ended -- more realistic than most films. The acting is pretty good and it moves along at a pretty good clip. Quaid is exceptional and you really wish he was your dad, or you were him. Too few people like that in the corporate world.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Austin Powers in Goldmember"></head><body><p>Dr. Evil and Mini-Me have somehow escaped from a maximum security prison and the duo team up with Goldmember. Together they formulate a plan for world domination. And this particular scheme requires a large amount of time-travel, and kidnapping Austin Powers' father, England's master spy, Nigel Powers. As Austin chases Dr. Evil, Mini-Me and Goldmember through time, he stops in 1975 to "connect" with an old girlfriend, detective Foxxy Cleopatra, and requests her help to track the villains and save his father. I recommend you see this one. I found this movie hilarious and outrageous, with a lot of crude humor. Watch this movie if you love Austin Powers as there is plenty of energy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="YEAH!  I love The Fugitive.....wait.......I mean um......Firewall....WAIT!"></head><body><p>Ok, ok.  Here we go.  24 is a.......what the heck did I just watch!  Oh, The Sentinel.  Okay.  Sorry it just reminded me of all those movies(which are better bye the way).  I was thinking of seeing this in theatres, thank goodness I didn't.  Its not really a bad movie, its just seems like its been done so many times before.  It was kind've like a special 1 and a half hour episode of 24, with a cool helicopter blowing up added in.  I'm just happy that Harrison Ford didn't join up on this project, Firewall was misguided, BUT I enjoyed that more than this, of course Ford is one of my favorite actors so I'm biased a bit.<br /><br />The acting was good, like I said before it was a bit like a made for TV movie.  It would be great to watch it on the SCI-FI channel or FOX, BUT for a movie that came out in theatres it was bland.<br /><br />Overall only rent this if you want to see Michael Douglas or are a huge 24 fan.  I, personally would rather watch Jack Bauer for an hour than this, but thats just me.....</p></body></html>

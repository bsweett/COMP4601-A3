Also it has great star power with Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford.  The setting, with a beautiful lake and Vermont mountains in the distance, is breathtaking.  The negatives include some moments in which the film seems to fragment and go off on an unexplained tangent and special effects which are never explained other than as mental aberrations on the part of the characters.  Pfeiffer is very engaging as a woman who suspects that her house is being haunted by the ghost of a woman who has died mysteriously.  She first thinks that it is a neighbor who has been killed by her husband.  The viewer never receives an explanation for the neighbor woman's angst and anger towards her husband which has led Pfeiffer to suspect a murder.  The suspense sometimes goes on too long and the dramatic effect is a bit strained at times. Also the &quot;ghostly happenings&quot; are never really explained.  However, this is a reasonably entertaining movie and will appeal to a wider range of people than most suspense films.</p></body></html>

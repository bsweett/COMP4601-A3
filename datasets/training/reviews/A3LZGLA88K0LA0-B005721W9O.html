<meta name="summary" content="JOLLY GOOD SHOW"></head><body><p>This is a delightful movie, full of the kind of overboard heroics, histrionics and mayhem that made STAR TREK as popular as it was.  Seeing the conventions with all the GALAXY QUEST questies is so incredibly ironic.  But what makes this movie work is the superb direction and acting that manages to bring such wonderful life and credibility to its pedestrian plot.  Although the idea of having actors forced to do the real thing is far above pedestrian, so forget that comment!  It's a good plot.  <p>Tim Allen is wonderful as the Shatneresque hero who uses his egotistical bravado to commandeer the Thermian's ship.  And yes, it's funny how he loses his shirt to the rock monster!  Sigourney Weaver, a simply amazing and versatile actress, shines as Tawny, the blonde airhead who repeats everything the computer says.  (She's quite dishy too as a blonde!).  Alan Rickman is wryly humorous as the serious actor who abhors his role, but comes through solidly when necessary.  A marvelous performance.  Sam Rockwell as the only non-series persona is hilarious as the actor who knows he's gonna get killed because he's just a &quot;guest star.&quot;  Tony Shalhoub is great as Fred, too.  The entire cast of Thermians is delightful in their innocence and awe of the actors who they think are the real thing!<br />It's a fun out of this world comedy and one of the best spoofs in a long time.<br />Relax and enjoy!!!!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p></body></html>

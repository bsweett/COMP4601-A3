<meta name="summary" content="A Brooding Harry Potter Returns"></head><body><p>For fans of Harry Potter, reviews are beside the point.  They will adore "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," the fifth film in the lucrative Warner Brothers franchise based on the enormously popular J.K. Rowling books.  But for average, non-Potter addicted movie goers, this installment will have a strong sense of deja vu.<br /> The current film begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) concluding a summer among the Muggles.  As his cousin and his cousin's sneering posse taunt Harry and try to provoke a fight, they are set upon by a couple of Dementors.  Harry uses magic to vanquish them, a feat that lands him in hot water at Hogwarts.  He has used magic in the presence of a Muggle.  Put on trial, Harry is exonerated only by the intervention of Dumbledore (Michael Gambon).<br /> The theme of the film is established in this opening sequence:  The potential for good and evil exists in everyone.  The path to either is fraught with consequences.  The person you become rests with the choices you make.<br /> Harry and pals Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) discover changes at Hogwarts that are detrimental and destructive, and must covertly develop their powers to combat them.  The fascistic Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) has been sent to Hogwarts by the Ministry to fix everything that's wrong.  She installs a new, useless curriculum that contains no means for the student wizards to defend themselves against threats from the Dementors and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes).<br /> Unlike earlier Potter films, "Order of the Phoenix" devotes surprisingly little screen time to the Harry/Ron/Hermione friendship.  In fact, Ron and Hermione are more like supporting than main characters.  Director David Yates and screenwriter Andrew S. Walsh have streamlined the novel to avoid an overly long running time, but the movie suffers in the details, some visuals, subplots (especially of Ron), and character development.<br /> Radcliffe is lankier and with more of a brooding quality than in previous Potter films, and his acting has matured.  He keeps his Harry grounded, even though a world of fantasy is the film's milieu.  His ability to make Harry a young Everyman is a key element in the movie series' success.  Radcliffe gives Harry a darker coloring this time so that he becomes less the fun-loving kid, amazed and thrilled at every new experience.  As an almost-adult, he sees real danger in the world around him.  Rather than leaving these dangers to the adults to reckon with, he is at the fore in confronting them himself.  His sense of responsibility to a greater good is being tested in "Order of the Phoenix," and this growth of character draws us in.<br /> Next to Radcliffe, Ms. Staunton has the most central role in "Order of the Phoenix."  Her Dolores Umbridge is every child's nightmare of the authoritarian figure from hell.  Self-righteous, power-hungry, toadying to her superiors, nit picking and petty, she has been armed with carte blanche from on high to destroy all independent thinking and competence at the school.  Dressed in assorted suits of flamingo pink hues and chirping with ominous cheer, she is everywhere, sticking her nose in corners, taking notes on teachers' performance and evaluating the school's efficiency as one might check on a factory's assembly line output.  Ms. Staunton, nominated for her moving performance as "Vera Drake," gives a broad, over-the-top performance that sometimes renders her Umbridge a bit cartoonish, but it is nonetheless fun to watch this veteran chow down on the scenery.<br /> Gary Oldman, as Sirius Black, becomes Harry's ally in battling the forces of evil and comes off as a sort of young Ben Kenobi as he mentors and fights beside Harry.  Ralph Fiennes, in horrid make-up and prosthetics, is unrecognizable as Voldemort, but succeeds in infusing him with both stature and menace.  Fiennes' screen time is brief, but his Voldemort commands every scene he's in.<br /> Special effects are present in "Order of the Phoenix," of course, but they're not as frequent or impressive as in the earlier Potter films.  When we do have an effects sequence, it is welcome, and usually fits well into the unfolding story.  There is a sense of wonder, for instance, when the young wizards secretly practice their spells and apparition-like animals dart hither and yon.  There is also a wonderful sequence of winged creatures transporting Harry and his friends over the countryside, and one of the mysterious, shadowy centaurs grouped menacingly in the dark of the woods.<br /> The Catch-22 of the Harry Potter movies is the belief that if not all of the book's sequences are included in the movie, loyal fans will rise up in protest.  On the other hand, if every sequence is included, the movie becomes a three-hour exercise in bladder control.<br /> Director Yates understands this dilemma and has gone the route of a tight running time, though at 138 minutes, it could still stand some trimming.  I have always felt that a movie should stand on its own and not depend on every viewer knowing every plot turn or slavishly including every sequence.  No movie can provide the detail that a book can, nor do movies have the time to do it.<br /> "Order of the Phoenix" comes off as a less-than-stellar adaptation of the Rowling book.</p></body></html>

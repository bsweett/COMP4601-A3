<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good, but has some noticeable flaws"></head><body><p>This movie is different and interesting enough to be fairly engaging, so I had no problem staying focused from start to finish, and I often couldn't predict what would happen next (which is good).  And most broadly, the movie portrays the important lesson that, in our quest for meaningful lives, human relationships may be the best we can do.<br /><br />But I was bothered by a few things, so I have to drop my rating to 4 stars.  Most prominently, the main character Ryan strikes me as implausible: he's handsome, charismatic, can empathize with the people he lays off, and generally seems mature in many ways, yet he inexplicably goes to extremes to avoid close relationships; also, he likes to be pampered while traveling, yet he tolerates spending his relatively few days at home in a somewhat dumpy little place.  Similarly, I found it implausible to see how Alex, his female counterpart, was clearly sending him signs of romantic interest, yet in the end turned out to supposedly not be interested at all.  Likewise, I found the character of Natalie to be somewhat of a stereotyped cliche.  Last but certainly not least, I didn't find that the portrayal of the people being laid off effectively connected me with the distinct pain they must have felt at that moment.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, this is still a good movie overall, and many people will find it worth watching.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Second Best Movie of the year so far, behind Iron Man"></head><body><p>There's never a dull moment for poor old Indiana Jr. And I haven't had so much fun since...well last week when I saw the premiere of the phenomenal IronMan. The special effects are amazing. And I Expect the DVD to be a work of Art. Namely the Sound. Lucas and his THX, Dolby Digital EX and Spielbergs own DTS ES. And for those really lucky, and rich, people out there the Blue-Ray will be explosive! Try the state of the art Dolby True HD and the Spielberg equivalent DTS-HD Master Audio. I can't wait to see it on my own equipment.<br />  The Chrystal Skull has a great, and imaginative story. The ending is, Unpredictable to say the least. And Indie jumps and dodges like a younger version of himself. Professor Jones never looked so weary as he was in the scenes in classroom. Kate Blanchet is Gorgeous and is equiped with a saucy sword to go with her leather gloves and boots. Shia Labeouf as Mutt Williams works well along-side the battle, blood and guts Harrison Ford. Karen Allen wears the biggest smile I've seen in a long time, and I'm glad to see her because it's nice to reminisce in movies. If I were to rate the Four movies this would be last. But that doesn't make it a failure. Those movies are all legendary classics. This just doesn't beat them. The way the movie reveals itself to me isn't as effective as the original trilogy. There were times in the originals where I was dying to find out what happens next. I was more or less searching for the meaning more than in the pursuit of mystery. The special effects blew me away, but none more than the horrendous Mushroom Cloud. So close that I had to look up into it. It was beautiful at the same time, with the sun behind it! Not that it matters to me, but it had a monster memorial weekend, though Monday isn't quite up yet. Somewhere in the 120million range I hear, which is second behind Pirates for biggest Memorial Weekend take.</p></body></html>

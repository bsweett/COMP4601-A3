<meta name="summary" content="The First and Finest Political Thriller!"></head><body><p>This is said to be one of president John F. Kennedy's favorite films, and you can see he had good taste in movies. This film succeeds in being a good suspense film and a great psychological drama. Great for smart and  sophisticated viewers, even though it will entertain anyone. Laurence  Harvey and Frank Sinatra are great, but Angela Lansbury is Dynamite as the  cold-hearted mother of Laurence Harvey. Great movie, definitely a  Must-See!</p></body></html>

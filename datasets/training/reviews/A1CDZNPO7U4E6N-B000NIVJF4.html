All the blood, guts, and gore I heard people talking about was almost non-existant. I was expecting to see the real story of Idi Amin, something harsh and brutal, but what I saw was a disapppointment. I didn't get to see any of those things. This movie is about his pyhsician..NOT HIM! Frankly, I this movie didn't show me anything but the rantings of a madman, and you sort of have to use your imagination for the rest of it. It had just a few scenes that make you cringe. Overall, I think that it failed to capture the whole story. They told you about the killings throughout the movie, but they never actually show you him killing anyone. I'm sorry, I just didn't get the full effect that I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, Forest Whitaker is awesome as always, and he did a good job playing this role, I just wasn't impressed with this movie. Frankly, I'm not the type that gets easily moved by blood, guts and gore, but if you're gonna make a movie that is based on a real person and real events then you shouldn't hold back. I couldn't help but think they could've taken this a step further, but they chose not to. I think that it focuses more on Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, and how he was mezmerized by the person he thought Idi Amin was in the beginning, so much to where he even became his personal physician. Then, he slowly realizes that the man that he has so much respect and admiration for indeed a murderous madman that's corrupted by power. I think I was expecting this movie to go more into depth about the vicious tyrant Amin was, and show more of his tirades and massacres, instead of them just telling me about it. They never show him refer to himself as "The Last King of Scotland" the press said that's what they heard he was calling himself. The stories suggest that he was a cannibal. I saw nothing to support or deny that either.  This review is only an opinion, and we all know what they are like, but I just don't share the same feelings that a lot of other viewers did. On top of that, the documetary on the DVD "Capturing Idi Amin" doesn't make him seem so bad. In fact, it seems like despite the stories we have heard about the killings of over 300,000 Ugandans a lot of them still love and respect him, and some still consider him a good man and a hero.</p></body></html>

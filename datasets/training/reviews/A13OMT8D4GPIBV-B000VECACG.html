<meta name="summary" content="One of the best Sci-Fi movies ever."></head><body><p>This is definitely one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever.  Steven Spielberg has given us many Sci-Fi movies and his first is still arguably his best.  The "Collector Edition" of Close Encouters of the Third Kind presents us with the third version of the 1977 hit.<br /><br />This is an absolutely wonderful movie and DVD.  It is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio, although this edition was not the one originally in theatres.  On top of that, it is a wonderful Two Disc Edition, with features that everyone could love.<br /><br />It includes a feauturette, clocking in at 102 minutes, is a movie itself.  It is entitled "Watch the Skies".  It also includes a second feauturette and a beavy of deleted scenes, 11 in total.  I suggest you pick this up.  You could always wait for the Definitive Three Disc Edition, but if you're hard up on cash, I suggest this one.  You will not be disappointed.  It's an excellent film.</p></body></html>

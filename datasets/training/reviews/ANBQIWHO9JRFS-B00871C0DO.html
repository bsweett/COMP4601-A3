<meta name="summary" content="Strange Horror-Comedy"></head><body><p>'An American Werewolf in London' is one of the best horror comedies of all-time, and is also one of the very few ones which actually works as a horror film.  Overall the humor is perhaps more important than the horror, but most horror-comedies don't take themselves seriously at all.  The film has a bizarre, unsteady tone, and the humorous and horrific elements are often juxtaposed unexpectedly, which will doubtless aggravate many.  Frankly, it doesn't really have much particular drive much of the time either, but the individual scenes all play nicely enough that it all still works.  Also, it's got some of the most awesome practical special effects of all-time.  Definitely one of the most worthwhile werewolf movies of all-time.<br /><br />The film opens with two young American, David and Jack, hitchhiking across the English moors, and eventually entering a pub ominously named 'The Slaughtered Lamb'.  The locals are rude and distant, so they eventually wander off into the night.  Turns out this wasn't such a wonderful idea, and that the locals did indeed have good reason to be in a bad mood:  There is a werewolf on the prowl, which attacks David and Jack, and is then dispatched by the locals.  Jack is killed but David survives and is hospitalized.  That's just the beginning, of course, and we all know what happens when you're bitten by a werewolf.<br /><br />Again, the film doesn't have an overwhelming amount of narrative thrust.  We have the setup, then David basically sits around for a while and falls in love with the nurse, Alex, there are some  amusing and strange dream sequences and eventually David turns into a werewolf leading to the final climax.  Still, we've got some fun stuff going on.  The film is rarely, ya know, laugh out loud funny, but it's consistenly amusing and clevr.  The best humor involves the mangled, gradually desiccated corpse of Jack who comes to David repeatedly, telling him to kill himself.  He's got most of the best lines, and is very nicely played by Griffin Dunne.  He's a humorous character, but not with out a certain menace.  David Naughton is good in the lead, your standard average everyman type character, but likable and believable enough.  Unlike many horror movies, humorous or otherwise, Landis really tries to get you to like the major protagonist, and succeeds, so the film has got a lot more human interest than a lot of horror films.<br /><br />The movie becomes a fair bit darker and more violent in the climax, though they certainly don't abandon humor entirely.  The transformation scenes are still extremely impressive today, and I do not doubt that they would've caused your head to explode back in '81.  The werewolf itself is less impressive, but I've seen a lot worse.  The major stalking/killing scenes are sharply done, and, again, played almost completely straight.  The ending is, perhaps, slightly anticlimactic, though it is nicely chaotic, with numerous car crashes and whatnot.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done.  A weird movie, but I like it.<br /><br />Grade: B+</p></body></html>

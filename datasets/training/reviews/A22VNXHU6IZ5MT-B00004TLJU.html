This superlative 2-DVD set includes the extended version of the film in both English and Italian!!! Wow!!! It sports BOTH great picture and sound!!! It also contains a wealth of extras to enjoy!!! This great DVD set will keep you amuzed for hours!!! And to cap it off,it comes in a nice collector's case!!! A very well rounded package of a very superior western starring Clint Eastwood,Lee Van Cleef,and Eli Wallach!!! Sure, it costs "a few dollars more" than the standard single disc version but it's well worth the money!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+</p></body></html>

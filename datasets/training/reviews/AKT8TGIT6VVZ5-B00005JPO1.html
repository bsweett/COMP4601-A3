<meta name="summary" content="Not the Best Indiana Jones Film, But Still Pretty Darn Good"></head><body><p>Thankfully neither George Lucas nor Stephen Spielberg have ruined the Indiana Jones franchise, like the Star Wars prequels almost did to the entire series, with the "Phantom Menace" being almost unwatchable. Instead, in "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull", we get a rousing bit of popcorn entertainment, harkening back to classic 1930s and 1940s serials. It is definitely not the best in the Indiana Jones franchise ("Raiders of the Lost Ark" is quite far the best), but it is a credible sequel to the previous three Indiana Jones films, picking up the action nearly 20 years after "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade". Noted screenwriter David Koepp has wrought an occasionally clunky screenplay, but this one truly works with ample excitement in store for veteran archaeologist Henry "Indiana" Jones Jr. and his pals. Of course there is also yet another rousing film score from composer John Williams, though the Indiana Jones theme isn't heard in its entirety until the film's closing credits. And there's excellent cinematography too from Janusz Kaminski, who is probably best noted for his work on "Schindler's List".<br /><br />It's 1957, and the opening sequences open and close with a bang, as a kidnapped Jones finds himself and his pal Mac (Ray Winstone) as prisoners of a secret Soviet Red Army strike force who've sneaked into Nevada's secret Area 51 in search of extraterrestrial treasure. Led by the sadistic KGB Colonel Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett in yet another fine performance), Indy is forced at gunpoint to find this treasure, and he does, before escaping and finding himself the lucky survivor of a US nuclear blast near the Area 51 complex. Back in Connecticut teaching archaeology at Marshall College (which is set at real-life Yale University), Indy finds himself the victim of a FBI witch hunt and the target of several KGB agents. He also meets up with college dropout Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), the bearer of dire news; old graduate school friend and colleague, archaeologist Harold Oxley (John Hurt) has been abducted in Peru,  along with Mutt's mother Mary, after Oxley discovered a secret kingdom of the crystal skull. So it's off to Peru in search of Oxley, mother Mary (who is actually Indy's old flame Marion Ravenswood) and meeting up once more with Mac, Spalko, and more Soviet soldiers.<br /><br />There are laughs a plenty in store for anyone who fondly remembers the previous Indiana Jones films. Ford brings a fine blend of elderly wisdom and young derring do in his latest portrayal of an older Indiana Jones (There's a brief reference too to the "Young Indiana Jones Chronicles" television series.). Karen Allen is superb as the older, more mature, Marion Ravenswood, but frankly, I wish she had more dialogue and screen time. As her son Mutt, Shia LaBeouf comes across as a risk-taking fictional version of a young James Dean, complete with almost the same wardrobe and coarse slang as Dean's. Last, but not least, Jim Broadbent is terrific in his few brief scenes as Marshall College's dean and Indy's long-time faculty friend and colleague. The film's end may not surprise those who've anticipated correctly the fine chemistry between Jones and Ravenswood, but it is certainly a delightful sentimental touch, with potential promise for more adventures in store for both Indy and Mutt. While "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" isn't quite the cinematic adventure that "Raiders of the Lost Ark" was, it is still a pretty darn good Indiana Jones film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent!"></head><body><p>My only problem with the two Bourne movies has been that they seem to be too short and scream for sequels.  Matt Damon is excellent and convincing as the cool Jason Bourne, trained by a covert government agency as the ultimate assassin.<br /><br />Jason has retired with his girlfriend from the first movie and is leading a quiet life in India.  All of a sudden there is a bombing to cover up some covert crime and the bombers have placed Jason Bourne's fingerprint at the scene.  To make the frame-up complete with no witnesses, an assassin is dispatched to take care of Bourne in India.  Of course the assassin fails but kills Bourne's girlfriend in the chase that ensues.  Thus Bourne again (as in the first movie) forced to deal with people who are trying to kill him, that he has no memory of.<br /><br />Meanwhile a European CIA operative (played brilliantly by Joan Allen) starts investigating Jason Bourne's classified records and starts to ask questions about Treadstone, which brings the remaining characters from the first movie into the fray.  The CIA head that tried to bury the Treadstone project keeps warning Allen that you don't know what you're getting yourself into.<br /><br />Little by little Bourne starts to find out some things about those who are after him until he can turn the tables against them.  Julia Styles is excellent in her small role and could have been used more.<br /><br />The action and the car chases in this movie are equal to the best films around!  Damon's Bourne is one of the best government agent characters I have seen in any film.<br /><br />It definitely helps to see the first movie prior to seeing this. (also, excellent).  I saw it a few days after on cable and then saw this movie a second time and was able to more readily follow the plot.</p></body></html>

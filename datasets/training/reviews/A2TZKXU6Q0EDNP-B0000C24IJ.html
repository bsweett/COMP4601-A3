<meta name="summary" content="A hommage to Deliverance and the Hills Have Eyes"></head><body><p>&quot;Wrong turn&quot; might not be cutting any new ground in its genre but it succeeds in what it wants to achieve as a film. Being a film that actually pays tribute to classics such as the &quot;Texas chainsaw massacre&quot;, &quot;The hills have eyes&quot; or the 70s cult film &quot;Deliverance&quot; it will be inevitably compared to these and it will stand very well.<br /><br />  With the &quot;familiar&quot; theme of inbred humanoid-monstroid incest products living in the &quot;woods&quot; who hunt down a company of unfortunate teens who happen to be lost in &quot;their&quot; forest with the intent to use them as body parts for their gruesome collection, &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; is both edgy and entertaining with more emphasis on the latter.<p>  It doesnt degenerate in an unwilling parody nor does it become a joke of itself because it's paced very well (the director rarely pulls the foot off the gas pedal) and because the cliches are actually working in favor of the film.<p>  As the inbreds pursue their victims through the forest the characters that &quot;fall&quot; first happen (...) to be the most annoying. But the game is set before that when the lost teens find temporary refuge in the bizzarohouse of the inbreds and while hiding in there they witness mutilations, human parts in the fridge, and the brutal chopping-up of one of their own.<p>  Where &quot;Wrong turn&quot; succeeds most is at the combination of humor with gore. It's not exactly simple to maintain a balance between these two but the film does walk the rope succesfully.<br />  For fans of this genre this is more than a welcome addition.<br />  Edgy, fun, pacey, and not cheesy it's a cool option for those Saturday night horror-video sessions with pizza.</p></body></html>

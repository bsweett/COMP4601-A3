That runs a close second to the 1994 debacle when "Pulp Fiction" lost the award to "Forrest Gump."  People make mistakes, and I'm trying to forgive them. Anyway, this gem of a film was nominated for 9 Oscars, and the Academy members saw fit to give it 2, one for Best Supporting Actress(Basinger) and the other for Best Adapted Screenplay.  The script is so razor-sharp that it is no wonder director Curtis Hanson collected what I think is one of the greatest ensembles in film history for the cast of the film.  Every actor here is excellent.  If I were a teacher of film studies, I would show this film long before "Citizen Kane."  This is classic film-noir with a bevy of interesting characters, an intricate plot with twists galore, outstanding direction and cinematography, and brilliant acting everywhere.  I simply cannot recommend this film highly enough.  This is a genuine masterpiece.  "You heard it here first, dear readers.  Off the record, on the Q.T., and very...Hush-Hush."</p></body></html>

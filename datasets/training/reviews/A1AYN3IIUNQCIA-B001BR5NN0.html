<meta name="summary" content="my favorite 80's flick"></head><body><p>it was just another detention Saturday. the people? a jock, a rebel, a beauty queen, a brain, and a basket case. during that Saturday, they would break through social barriers and discover that inside, there all the same. it was then they became the Breakfast Club. this is definently a great film, not just because its a Hughes film but the movie just breaks down the bounderys that keep people apart in school and shows that everyone from the high and mighty to the small and tiny have problems like everyone else. the actos are also great, Ringwald, Estevez, Sheedy, Nelson, and Hall each bring there characters to life with vibrant results. the movie through out then turns these typicall stereotypes into regular people. watching it, i realized why it was so popular in the 80's and i wonder why arent more films like this? even if the movie is a little old, its still fresh when watching and it still can effect people today. so see in my terms, the best 80's flick (screw the oscar's)</p></body></html>

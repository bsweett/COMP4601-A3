<meta name="summary" content="I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE"></head><body><p>If you get the feeling you've seen this movie before it's probably because you have. In fact it was another Stephen King movie, done much better, Called, &quot;The Dark Half&quot;.<br /><br /> Oddly enough, that movie's star Timothy Hutton is a co-star in this movie. The movie stars Johnny Depp as Mort Rainey, a successful mystery writer who's holed up in his lakeside cabin trying to finish a novel even though his mind is on a messy divorce proceeding with his cheating wife (Maria Bello).<br /><br /> One day, a scary cracker (John Turturro, with a ludicrous Mississippi accent) appears on Mort's doorstep claiming the author has word-for-word stolen a story he had written years before and published it in the Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine.<br /><br /> He's innocent, of course, and tries to brush off the man, and even calls the police. But nothing works, and pretty soon the disgruntled amateur is stalking Mort, killing off his friends and making a most unusual demand on his literary talent.<br /><br /> Like so many Hollywood thrillers of the past decade, the movie's structure takes you along a certain path and then drops a revelation in the last act that's supposed to raise the hair on the back of your neck and force you to see the story in a whole new light.<br /><br /> But Koepp's script and direction is just not clever enough to make the trick work. The audience is way ahead of him on this one. When you add the usual thriller cliches and some graphic abuse of women and dogs to the predictability, it's altogether a bad trip.<br /><br /> Depp, who spends most of the movie in a ragged bathrobe and what looks like a blond fright wig, has some enjoyably eccentric moments as the tormented hero. But his shtick doesn't add up to a performance, and the film never kicks in as a character study or a star vehicle.</p></body></html>

So I watched it with a completely open mind.  I didn't even know that it was based on a true event, until the final closing credits.<br /><br />I was quickly drawn into the story.  Emile Hirsch is a very attractive, sympathetic actor and I was rooting for the hero early on.  His encounters with folks he met along the road underlined my liking for him.<br />He was kind to everyone, gave the old guy in the phone booth a quarter, refused to take easy advantage of the cute teenage girl, and read all the right books.  His adventures before Alaska make up the best part of the film, in my opinion and I understand that these were based on letters from folks who had actually met McCandless.  Apparently he was a charismatic guy who made a big impression on people.<br /><br />Once he gets to the wilderness and walks in, I had the feeling this wasn't going to end all that well for him.  But I hung in there, cheering him on, even as he kept taking in his belt.  Surely, such a sunny personality as his would find a way to triumph over adversity, one would think..<br /><br />So, when the end came...not a pretty ending, nothing heroic, I was left feeling strangely empty.  Not sad, no tears, just...nothing.  The fake "spiritual" scene of the guy looking up at the light in the sky didn't do it for me....I found that sort of a cheap trick on the part of the film maker.<br /><br />Reading the number of critical reviews here helped me realize why I was so strangely unaffected by what should have been an extremely moving film.  I am a multi-Kleenex movie watcher but I couldn't muster one tear for this guy.  I didn't really see him as inconsiderate and lacking in love, as a number of reviewers here did.  I really understood (I thought) how his background would drive him to such desperation.  It just seemed so pointless in the end.  Did anyone learn anything?  Well, maybe, as he wrote, between the lines in one of his books, that "happiness must be shared"...maybe that was it.  Too bad the lesson came too late.  Maybe, as the voice over of his sister claimed, that his absence had a positive effect on his warring, materialistic parents.<br /><br />The cast is very good, especially Katherine Keener and Hal Holbrook.  But I don't think Hirsch was the right actor for the role.  McCandless must have had a strong self-destructive nature and this doesn't come across at all in his character or performance.  Sean Penn, had he been younger, would have been great at showing both the darkness that must have been there and the charm that people spoke of.  Hirsch just looks like a really sweet kid who might live next door and whom you'd want to hire to mow your lawn.<br /><br />Mostly I think that the blame for the misfire of the film lies with Penn as the writer and director.  He may have attempted to portray McCandless in a neutral way but McCandless comes across as everyone's hero...the good looking, really kind, likable kid who is trying to live a pure moral existence.  It's sort of dangerous and even irresponsible, I think, to give his view of McCandless.  If Penn had aimed at a more accurate documentary style portrayal, we would have seen the character's fatal flaws earlier one.  If Penn had wanted to give us pure fiction, then a more satisfying dramatic ending would have been in order.  If the boy's death really did humanize his parents, maybe showing that would have given us some sense of resolution.  As another reviewer wrote, the way the kid dwindled away, even the bear didn't bother with him.  That's really sad, given all of the passion with which he embarked on his pilgrimage.  Reminds me of the line from  T.S. Eliot poem  about the world ending not with a bang, but with a whimper.  I would have wanted more for the real Chris McCandless.</p></body></html>

I've noticed his brillance in other films before such as "Heist", "The Spanish Prisoner" and "House of Games" but for some reason there's something about "Spartan" that made me pay even more attention to his words than I normally do. There's a scene when we first meet Ed O' Neill's character listen very carefully to the exchange betweem Val Kilmer and him. Pay attention to the rhythm of the dialogue. Sometimes it's as if they talk, but they don't say anything. Other times it's as if they understand each other, but the viewer don't know what's going on.<p> "Spartan" starts off exactly like that. We don't clearly know what's going on. That is of course considering you have not seen the trailers or read the film's reviews. I hadn't. I prefer to walk into a movie cold. I want to be completely surprised. I don't want to know one bit of information. And if you go into this movie that way "Spartan" starts to unravel like a puzzle. We don't know what is going on, but we know what ever it is, it's bad. Now this may bother some viewers. There is no personal involvement. We are constantly on the outside looking in, but if your familiar with Mamet's work, this is the way he operates. This should not come as a shock to you.<p> "Spartan" for the most part is an entertaining film. It has as I mentioned the usual fascinating dialogue, the clever characters, Mamet never looks down upon his audience. It has plenty of twist and turns but there is a problem with it. As much as I enjoy Mamet's work, I'm not a push over for him. I'll call it like I see it. And the final act of the film is slightly disappointing. It's hard to describe without spoiling the film, so my statements may seem vague, but after you've seen the movie you'll unerstand. The resolution to the movie is not handled in the manner I felt it should be. Here we have a film that deals with complex problems and has equally complex characters and yet the final moments seem all too simple. How could a movie that seems as "tricky" as this be solved so easily? It doesn't add up. As we watch it we think to ourselves "what! This is it?" We are almost expecting something more. We are waiting for one more final twist. Besides that though the film works.<p> "Spartan" is not about cons and con men. It deals with what seems to be the CIA or FBI. If anything its closer to "Homicide" then say "Heist".<p> Val Kilmer leads the cast and does some impressive work. Sadly he has kind of dropped out of the loop and is no longer a major Hollywood player. But now he seems to be doing some of his best work. Check him out in "The Salton Sea" as well. William H. Macy, a Mamet regular is quite good in this film, but has a brief part. To be honest, the whole cast works well together.<p> Bottom-line: Above anything else it's Mamet dialogue that steals the show. Doesn't rely on the plot twist so much this time as it does the people. Has some good performances headed by Kilmer. Has some great moments but slows down near the end.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="TEDIOUS & POINTLESS"></head><body><p>In heartland America, a plane crashes into a local water supply.  It carries a secret biological weapon and it's making the population crazy.  A couple - she's a doc and he's a cop - fight their way out of a government sanctioned quarantine that mandates total annihilation.  Not only that, the infected populace are acting like killer mutant zombies.  Our hero couple are devoted, fiercely protective and pregnant but we know nothing about them as human beings and their gory battle is tedious and pointless since the government is going to nuke them and whatever town the eventually flee to at some point.  Brent Eisner, Michael's boy, directed with a heavy hand.</p></body></html>

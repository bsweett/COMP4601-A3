And Thank You For Smoking really doesn't take sides if that's what you're thinking. This is not a documentary or a "Super Size Me" reality trip. It's entertainment in the purest form of the art.<br /><br />Whether you hate smoking or smoke like a chimney, Thank You For Smoking will make you laugh. It'll dazzle you with quick-witted rhetoric. It indeed will provide food for thought about how this country is not lead by leaders, but by those that can spin a tale in their favor with the cleverest amount of craft.<br /><br />And most importantly, Thank You For Smoking epitomizes the notion that you don't necessarily have to win an argument to walk away with all of the chips; all you have to do is make the pubic believe that your opponent is wrong.<br /><br />Thank You for Smoking is intelligent, thought provoking and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. Not a single boring moment.<br /><br />SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING:  Aaron Eckhart's (Nick Naylor) performance is killer.  Katie Holmes' precarious positions could cause blindness. William H. Macy's perfect reflection of the people that run our country could drive you to drink. Seeing J.K. Simmons portray a brash pompous jerk again could cause deja vu. The lovable Robert Duval telling you to smoke could cause you to smoke. And Sam Elliott looks so much like the Marlboro Man you could get whiplash from a double-take.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stanley Kubrick's Best Film"></head><body><p>Eyes wide shut is by far Stanley Kubrick's best film this film blows you away for the whole 2 1/2 hours. Its photographed extremely well the acting is brillent and the direction is simple amazing. The DVD is not bad either I just wish they had a unrated version for you can see the way Kubrick's hunting orgy sequence was suppose to look. But who knows when thats going to happen this film is just Kubrick at his best.</p></body></html>

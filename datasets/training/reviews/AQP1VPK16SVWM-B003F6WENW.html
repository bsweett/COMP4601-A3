The concept continues to elude many men like the idea of taking a shower after working out. Divorce mediators Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) and John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) have a most unusual hobby that allows them to pick up women seeking commitment but avoid the dreaded band of gold themselves-crashing weddings! This clever duo can masquerade as friends of the family regardless of who is involved. When Jeremy learns that the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury (Christopher Walken) he and John do the old Potomac Two Step and waltz right in as if they are close friends of the family. What they find is...love, desire and a family as nutty as a fruit cake. John is immediately taken with Claire (Rachel McAdams) while Jeremy finds her sister Gloria (Isla Fisher)attractive, frightening and a handful.<br /><br />A genre mishmash of a buddy/romantic comedy, "Wedding Crashers" works so well not necessarily because of how good the material is (and it is pretty good) but due to the deft talents of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in the lead roles. Both give charming performances and the marvelous supporting cast provides perfect counterpoint to these charming rogues. "Wedding Crashers" became the biggest comedy of the summer and deservedly so.<br /><br />Featuring a stellar transfer that looks as bright detailed as a designer wedding dress, "Wedding Crashers" looks and sounds marvelous in this edition. Using the seamless branching technique that worked so well for "Gladiator: Special Edition" and "Alien", "Wedding Crashers" can be viewed in either its original R rated format or unrated. The unrated edition runs a little over eight minutes longer and primarily consists of scene extensions. The images are vivid with bright lively colors. I didn't detect any sort of digital artifacts and analog defects are nonexistent. The 5.1 format isn't used as well as an action movie but there are nice effects placed all around the speakers. Dialogue is crisp and clear which is what you want in a comedy.<br /><br />We get some interesting extras here.  We get deleted scenes, two featurettes one that shows how the weddings were staged for the movie and the second featuring actors Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn discussing "The Rules" of wedding crashing. Likewise "The Rules of Wedding Crashing" are presented in text format with all the rules discussed by the main characters. The first featurette is the best and at under 12 minutes your attention won't wander. The second is a more traditional promotion piece. The third will make you wish you were dancing at someone's reception as your butt falls asleep. We also get trailers, a track listing for all the songs used in the film and music video by The Sights of the song "Circus". There's also DVD-ROM content allowing you to compare the script to the final film and some other goodies that will make your crashing experience perfect.<br /><br />We get two commentary tracks with stars Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn providing play-by-play on the film. Their commentary track is a bit less informative but funnier than director Dobkin's who focuses much more on the production challenges of the film itself. Together they represent the perfect commentary track with just the right amount of background information and irreverence.<br /><br />A delightful romantic comedy, "Wedding Crashers" took many by surprise earning its place among the top performers of 2005. Families should be warned, however, that "Wedding Crashers" isn't for everybody as it earned its R rating for sexual content. The unrated version features about 8 minutes of additional footage extending several scenes but honestly the theatrical version was just great the way it was.</p></body></html>

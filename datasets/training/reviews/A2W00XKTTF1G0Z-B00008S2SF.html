<meta name="summary" content="Bond Is Really Back In Action!"></head><body><p>DIE ANOTHER DAY is the 20th in the bond series. It has a nice twist in that in the beginning 007 fails and becomes a POW. It the twists in the story that make this film very interesting. Pierce Brosnon (Remington Steel, The Thomas Crown Affair, The World Is Not Enough) does a great job in this film and seems to play vulnerability well. The story is that of a terrorist and diamond collector wanna-be that develops a device that could - you guessed it - destroy the world. Directed by Lee Tamahori (Mullholland Falls) this is the technically finest of any of the Bond films. Score by David Arnold ( )<p>This film has action and gadgets like you wouldn't believe. The star prop in this film, is, as in most of the Bond films, his car. This one is invisible. Not to mention his high tech watch and incredible stunts like you haven't seen before. The effects and technology have changed so much that you can't tell what's real and what is digital. Oh, and did I mention that James Bond always gets the girl? Or, "Girls" rather?<p>Now the cast is very cool. Halle Berry (X-men, Monsters Ball, Bullworth) is really good and an American Agent and she can really strut her stuff both in the bedroom and when she is dodging bullets. There is swordplay and fighting, chasing, car crashes, airplane explosions, laser destruction, high-speed ice battles and so much more. The villains are played by Toby Stephens (Space Cowboys, Orlando) and Rick Yune (The Fence, Fast and Furious) .  <p>And, you could expect nothing but the best from British Secret Service Leader - Judi Dench ( Shakespeare In Love, Iris, The Shipping News ) as "M" and the ever and always funny John Cleese (Holy Grail, A Fish Called Wanda ) and "Q".<p>Overall this film had action and adventure and an extreme adrenaline rush from beginning to end. The only thing that was a little "out of place" was the opening titles. They were not as "Bondish" as they usually are. Not as interesting and more abstract. However, who could be the title song sung by Madonna - who also makes a cameo appearance as a Sword Play expert. She looks good. If you are a bond fan, you'll enjoy this experience and if you are not or never seen a Bond film - you are in for the ride of your life. The film is for the whole family. (11-22-02)</p></body></html>

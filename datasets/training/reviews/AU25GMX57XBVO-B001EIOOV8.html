<meta name="summary" content="Very entertaining but just too much violence and blood"></head><body><p>The storyline to Casino is well written and very entertaining, but thought the graphic violence, blood and language was just too much. Especially the ending scene with Pesci, I mean there are other similar movies like this I have enjoyed but for some reason thought it went too far here.  This is by no means a family movie or one for kids.  If you like mystery/crime movies then think you will enjoy it and even though it's a very long film, should keep your attention well from beginning to end but if you don't like a lot graphic violent blood scenes like ones from horror films, then you might want to skip it.<br /><br />Peter J.

<meta name="summary" content="A Missed Opportunity..."></head><body><p>1962's "The Manchurian Candidate" was an outstanding classic of an earlier era of movies, crisply shot in black and white and featuring a talented cast and a tightly wound, haunting plot firmly embedded in the tensions and paranoia of the Cold War.  2004's remake also features a talented cast in Denzel Washington, Liev Schrieber, Meryl Streep and Jon Voigt, but misses badly as a movie.  Produced for an audience that might only dimly remember the Cold War, the substitute premise of a rogue corporation selling arms fails the plausibility test, while a major change in the plot undercuts the credibility of one of the principal characters.<br /><br />Major Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) is a veteran of the Gulf War, suffering from nightmares that seem to present an alternate version of a fire fight in which his life was saved by a Sergeant Raymond Shaw.  Shaw, played with disquietingly detached deameanor by Liev Schrieber, is now on a greased path to political stardom, coached by his ambitious and prominent mother, played by Meryl Streep.  Marco's attempts to resolve his nightmares lead him to contact Shaw and to suspect that his experience in the Gulf was an illusion.  Marco's quest for the truth will lead him into a nasty conspiracy involving brainwashing, with a shocking outcome for Marco and Shaw.<br /><br />"The Manchurian Candidate" has a good build-up, as Marco relentlessly seeks the truth of his experience in combat.  However, the movie loses its way in its closing stages.  An effort to be original by introducing changes in the basic story makes for an incoherent and implausible ending.  2004's "The Manchurian Candidate" may well be a perfectly acceptable movie for someone who had never seen the original.  For those who saw and appreciated the original, this remake is a missed opportunity, worth a look mostly for the outstanding cast.</p></body></html>

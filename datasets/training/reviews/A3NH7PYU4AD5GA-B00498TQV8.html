<meta name="summary" content="Home of the Brave"></head><body><p>Life is harsh for 17 y old Ree. She lives in a cottage in poorest Missouri with two little siblings who depend on her, and a mentally ill mother: mom has given up, she did not have what it takes to face this life. Dad has run away. He is out on bail. If he does not show up for his court date, his bail will be lost and the cottage will be owned by the bail agent.<br /><br />Ree starts looking for her dad. She has nice neighbors who don't let the family starve. She has a good friend and an uncle, unfortunately a dope head. She runs into people who don't want her to go around asking questions. The social world of Ree's dad is about drugs and sheriffs and snitches and bail agents.<br /><br />Ree is a brave girl, she fights for her home and her family, but the world looks depressing and hopeless. Nevertheless, this little movie with no stars and no props and minimal budgets is truer than most Hollywood productions.<br />The story leaves you at a dead end. Ree wins a victory of sorts and her little brother is happy that she does not have to enlist in the army for the sign up money, but we know that this is a Pyrrhus victory. There is no hope to break the cycle. And yet, the film leaves us in an amazingly uplifting, though totally illusionary mood.</p></body></html>

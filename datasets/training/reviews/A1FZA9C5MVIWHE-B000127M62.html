<meta name="summary" content="it would be better if Kelly Rowland wasn't in it!"></head><body><p>seriously, way better! one thing I didn't expect to see was someone from Destiny's Child trying to act. Kelly Rowland comes up short. don't get me wrong, she's pretty, but Destiny's Child sucks! it was fun to watch this movie and see Freddy and Jason kick each other's rumps. i would have liked it better if a chick that was into metal played Kia.</p></body></html>

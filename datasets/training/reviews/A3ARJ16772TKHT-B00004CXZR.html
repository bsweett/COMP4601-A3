<meta name="summary" content="Star Trek: The Almost-No-Motion Picture"></head><body><p>This one will only really satisfy the real fans, if even them. The story used here comes from a script that they had worked out for "Star Trek Phase II", the sequel series that Paramount considered producing in the seventies. As an episode in a long running series, it would have worked. In fact, it largely resembles the basic story for the original series episode "The Changeling" from the sixties.<br /><br />The bad thing, though, is that, in order to take a story from an episode and make it a 2hr+ movie, they added several long scenes of people waiting and looking at ... something. It's never clearly explained, though it's easier to understand the geometry of V'ger's ship in this Director's Cut, with better special effects. It doesn't help the slow plotting, but it eliminates a bit of the confusion.<br /><br />In the end, there are some classic Trek moments here and there, but you have to wade through this plodding movie to get to them. Basically, the best thing to come out of this movie is that it proved that people still had a desire for more Trek. It did monster business when it came out, but people soon realized it wasn't all they'd hoped. The studios wised up before making the next one, but they could see that there was a market.<br /><br />More specific to this DVD release, the special features are quite interesting if you like understanding how movies are made.<br /><br />Just remember, this movie is really best viewed by those who already love the series and can forgive a misstep here and there.</p></body></html>

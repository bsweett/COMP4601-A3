<meta name="summary" content="Hellboy Movie."></head><body><p>Was able to see the movie a while back. Pretty good, I don't follow this character much so I am not a huge fan, but I like the movie. and I never heard of him til' now, Of course I wish hollywood wouldn't ruin comic books by making a movie out of every one of them! Good movie, good special effects and action.</p></body></html>

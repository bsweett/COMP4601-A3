<meta name="summary" content="I LIKED IT!!"></head><body><p>First of all, let me just say that I watched this movie once, and even though I liked it this isn't something I would wanna see over and over again. With that being said, I knew, (just like I'm sure you all did) the subject matter of the film, so I don't see why some viewers (no matter how few) act so offended by what they saw. Secondly, you must take into account when this movie takes place (time and era). Thirdly, It seems that instead of dewelling on the superb acting and storyline people are more so effected by the fact that it's about homosexuality between "gay cowboys". I guess the point flew over their heads that this is indeed a love story, and as with most love stories (except for teen movies) they all end in tragedy. It's usually in that tragedy that the person realizes what they lost. It actually took Ennis losing Jack to realize that he was the love of his life. I liked it because it was a realistic and very delicate look at love between 2 males. If I wanted to see gay guys sleeping around I could've sat at home and watched "Queer as Folk". Another thing is that people seem to be more disgusted at 2 guys than 2 women. I guarantee you if it had been 2 women the guys would've been cheering them on. Anyway, this sort of thing this has been apart of films for as long as I could remember.Let's not forget, Hilary Swank.."Boy's Don't Cry" or Charlize Theron..."Monster" it's just that "Brokeback Mountain" is sooo in your face. At any rate, to stay on topic, Heath Ledger made his character so believeable that he deserves an Oscar for this. Ennis' inner struggle with his own purpose, identity and sexuality is one that some of my best friends have had to endure. Prejudice is another. Jake's character Jack was also believable, and he deserves an Oscar as well. Even though I may be a straight woman, I could still relate to those feelings of love and hope for someone that you love, and only getting feelings of isolation, regret, shame and embarrassment in return. My only gripe is that I wish they would've explained the ending a lot better. I kinda keeps you guessing about what actually happened to Jack. I think they should've talked more about that. Like, Was he murdered in hate crime fashion because he was gay? Did someone else besides their boss see them on Brokeback Mountain? Did he come on to the wrong guy? I guess I just want to know..Why did they kill him? Also, I'm a little curious because at the end when his wife was talking to Ennis about Jack's death she didn't seem grief stricken like a wife who just lost her husband would. Did she find out about him like Ennis' wife did? or Did her father have something to do with it after Jack stood up to him? I had tons of unanswered questions by the time the movie was over. Which, by the way, this film was way too long come to think of it. However, you have to watch it with an open mind to like it.</p></body></html>

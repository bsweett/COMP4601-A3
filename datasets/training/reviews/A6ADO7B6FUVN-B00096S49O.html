<meta name="summary" content="Will Smith as Cupid in Terrific Comedy..."></head><body><p>Cupid flutters around spreading happiness with his arrows of love and affection.  These arrows strike each target with one single attempt, as the person falls in love after the single moment when the arrow strikes them.  Love changes everything, as it means commitment, trust, and mutual affection when the love is answered.  Hitch (Will Smith) is the human cupid, as he works his magic as a partner consultant that helps men get noticed by the woman who is the target of their love.  Everything around Hitch oozes of class as nothing is cheesy, cheap, or corrupt. He is a true gentleman that helps others find their opportunity with love by shooting his arrows of affection.<br /><br />Hitch ended up becoming a love consultant due to an incident in college when he suffered from a broken heart.  Now he focuses on helping guys like he once was, as he helps them strategize their upcoming encounters and dates.  Carefully Hitch helps the men with how to approach the women, what to say, and how they must behave around the woman they love.  Everything is thoroughly planned, as it all comes down to one moment - the first kiss.<br /><br />When Hitch meets his freshest client Albert (Kevin James) he senses a disaster.  The problems increase when he finds out that Albert loves Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), a famous and incredibly rich woman.  Nonetheless, Hitch believes that he can pull it off by creating a masterpiece.  Simultaneously, he meets Sara (Eva Mendes), a relentless gossip columnist, with whom he falls in love.  This affair turns into a greater mess than expected for Hitch who finds himself kicking women, having severe food allergies, while Sara finds it difficult to combine personal life and professional life.<br /><br />Hitch is a warm comedy about love, affection, and the connection between people.  Will Smith is perfect for the role as Hitch, as he easily drifts into the gentle and cool character.  His performance is well balanced with the supporting cast, and Kevin James complements Will Smith by making the two look like contemporary Laurel and Hardy.  In the end, Hitch will offer an easy comedy with some great laughs, but also an interesting notion in regards about the opportunity of love.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Groundhog Day" meets "Quantum Leap""></head><body><p>Source Code is a suspenseful, surprisingly intelligent, occasionally touching, movie that's far better than I'd expected it to be. With tight pacing, great editing, good acting and fine directing by Duncan Jones, best known for Moon, it's a very good sci-fi action film released outside the usual summertime area for such movies.<br /><br />The film tells the tale of a man (Jake Gyllenhall), who wakes up on a train. He has no idea why he's there or who the woman across from him is. As he's trying to get things sorted out, an explosion goes off, killing everyone. He then comes to inside a capsule where it's explained to him that the train was blown up in a terrorist bombing. The terrorist was kind enough to do a practice run and apparently plans to detonate a dirty bomb in Chicago. Due to some sort of "quantum" effect he can "leap" into the body of a man who died on the train and live out his last eight minutes of life. Doing that will, with luck, enable him to find the bomber.<br /><br />If it's a premise that sounds familiar, that's because it is. It's perhaps no surprise that Scott Bakula's voice turns up in a cameo during the movie, since it clearly owes a lot to his most famous work. In fact, it's basically Quantum Leap mashed-up with Groundhog Day while managing to be better than the first and at least as engaging as the second.<br /><br />There was really nothing I disliked about this film. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's the best film I've seen so far this year, and, sadly, will likely be the best science fiction film for quite some time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Half a Great Movie"></head><body><p>Grindhouse - the art of making movies without a budget - seems to have fallen into the lexicon of movie-watchers again and that seemed great at first. It basically aid that independent film, really independent film, could have a platform if something like this succeeded. The format would be one that allowed for all types of terrible things to happen, and it didn't have to apologize for it. Over-the-top action, horrid effects just for the sake of shock, acting that can be questionable or beautiful; everything funny in the world of movies could live under one roof. It sounded so beautiful. Sadly, there are some downsides to that as well and they dealt with making a film like this just to do it: fake problems with the film, fake missing reels, false problems hoping to mirror working with only a master. This creates some problems, too, and those problems were self-inflicted injuries on what could have otherwise been a great movie.<br /><br />As far as Planet Terror goes, it is funny and builds a surprisingly good movie for the first half of the film. I was actually caught up in it, enjoying the chemical problem the town had and the over-the-top characterizations showcased on the screen. I didn't really like the fact that the movie came with cigarette burns that were placed in the movie on purpose, that the film was grainy and that was also on purpose, but it helped the movie as I watched half of it. Then a little segment called " Reels Missing" came up and, after that, the movie kind of dragged on.<br />If it would have continued with the tale, not doing that to try and be like something old-school, it would have been a lot better.<br /><br />I'm not saying that Planet Terror didn't have anything to offer or that it wasn't entertaining. I liked a lot of it and it had some funny things happening. The problem here, the gimmick, was one that wasn't subtle and wasn't needed and ending up hurting the movie. It took the linear interaction between the audience and the people in the film and made them that and that alone; had the gimmick not been the primary kicker I think it would have been noticed more.<br />Watch if bored but don't think that the box office bomb was because of anything save a lackluster execution on what was an otherwise entertaining outing.</p></body></html>

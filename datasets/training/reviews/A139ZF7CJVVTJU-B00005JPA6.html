<meta name="summary" content="A Beautiful Maze"></head><body><p>A lush and viciously visceral film, "Pan's Labyrinth" twists together the brutal realities of post-war Spain with a vibrant and equally frightening fairy tale land, filled with dangerous quests, helpful faeries, and one questionable, bark-skinned faun.  The end result is as visually decadent as it is emotionally compelling, a harsh but gorgeous and richly-filmed fable.<br /><br />Most of Guillermo del Toro's (Hellboy) story centers around the young Ofelia, a tender-spirited girl who spends much of her time with her nose in a book.  Her mother -- who has recently wed (and carries the unborn child of) the heartless Capitan Vidal -- remarks that it isn't healthy for a girl to read so many fairy tales.  It doesn't seem to occur to her that it is far more unhealthy to move that child to a sawmill-cum-Fascist military compound, especially when that compound is filled with spies, surrounded by rebels, and commanded by a cold, paranoid power-monger.<br /><br />The tension between the light of childish innonce and the dark dredge of men at war is what the movie balances on, like a colorfully creepy Cirque de Soleil performer executing gorgeous cartwheels on a tightrope of razor wire.  Ofelia's fantasy world (real or not, who's to say?) offers some kind of escape, but it's not necessarily the comforting kind.  Perhaps she is reacting to a normal child's helplessness (her pregnant mother grows sicker as the Capitan's struggle with the rebels grows more out of control), perhaps she is just embracing a world with contours that are easier to read, where good and evil are not so hazy or hard to confront.<br /><br />Whatever the case, it makes for entrancing viewing.  The parallel stories turn around each other, unfolding against the drama of righteous resistance, unflagging faith, and hope in the tenuous strength of truth.  A soldier on the verge of death has a gun thrust in his face, and he weakly but defiantly slaps the barrel away several times, knowing that his is a largely symbolic act.  Death isn't the point.  The freedom to fight is.<br /><br />Ofelia fights with equal measure, and to many viewers, it may be hard to watch.  Like the old fairy tales of yore (before Disney cut out the spiny parts and added childish treacle), this is a story that is as creative, imaginative, and weird as it is horrifying and gut-wrenching.  At one point, Ofelia tells a story to her unborn brother about a special flower that, if it is plucked, will give eternal life.  The catch?  Its thorns contain a poison that will kill you instantly.  Because of this risk, the flower remains forever untaken and unused, its potential eternally lost.<br /><br />Ofelia takes risks and so does this movie.  Some may find it hard to stomach, but others, wading through its crisp, uncompromising imagery and its tragic but redemptive telling, might find something to hold onto and remember.  This movie is a gorgeous flower, one worth plucking and saving, but just like Ofelia's fairy tale rose, this is one blossom with bite.<br /><br />(Note: this is a Spanish film with English subtitles.)</p></body></html>

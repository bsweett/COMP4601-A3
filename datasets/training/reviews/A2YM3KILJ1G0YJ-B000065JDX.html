<meta name="summary" content="I honestly don't understand how someone could dislike this movie"></head><body><p>If you want a movie with a great cast, this is it: George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, consistently hilarious Cheech Marin, Juliette Lewis, Fred Williamson, the gorgeous Salma Hayek, Quentin Tarantino, Danny Trejo (who, like Luis Guzman, always makes a movie better), legendary makeup artist Tom Savini (aka Sex Machine), and Kelly Preston even has a bit part!  Some may not be fans of Tarantino as an actor, but there is no denying that the power this cast has easily overshadows Tarantino's limits, and would probably even cover for Keanu Reeves.  Maybe.<br /><br />If you want a visceral gore-fest, this is it: vampire parts fly in gory, green explostions; whole people explode, arms and next get gouged, stakes get rammed, and there's even a scene where Fred Williamson literally rips out a person's heart.  This is a graphically violent film for the lovers of over the top violence.  If your primary reason for watching CSI is SPECIFICALLY to see blood spatter (read: blood showers), then this might be up your alley.<br /><br />If you want a surreal, exploitative movie made explicitly for the thrills, this is it: a Holy Water super-soaker, vampires of all shapes and sizes, a penis-revolver, a shotgun/table leg cross, perhaps the most attractive collection of hookers and dancers ever seen (especially in a grungy P.O.S. bar just over the U.S. - Mexican border), and a corpse guitar are enough to cause a laugh-riot and sensory overload, sure to satiate even the most impatient movie-goer.<br /><br />If you want action-adventure, this is it: Psychopathic and violent, Brothers Seth (Clooney) and Richard (Tarantino) Gecko are wreaking havoc on their way towards a rendezvous with their contact in a run-down Mexican strip-joint/brothel/bar.  Along the way they murder and pillage, then take a family - Jakob Fuller (Keitel), daughter Kate (Lewis), and Jakob's adopted son - hostage to add the tension.  Determining who will survive the ordeal is difficult as is, but when the group finally descends upon the "Titty Twister" (the bar), and the vampire strippers and truckers begin to show their teeth, the action goes to eleven almost immediately after pulling up a barstool.<br /><br />Add in Tarantino's famous tongue-twisting dialogue and nearly perfect screenplay, direction from Robert Rodriguez that keeps the movie rocking, superb camerawork, extras pouring out of the DVD case (commentary from Tarantino and Rodriguez, music videos, deleted scenes, bios, etc.), and THE most seductive table-top dance scene in movie history (courtesy of Salma Hayek), and the result is one best guilty pleasure movies ever made, and just a great time overall.  I actually pity you if you can't shut the critical analysis portion of your brain off long enough to enjoy this movie.</p></body></html>

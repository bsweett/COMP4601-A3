<meta name="summary" content="Artistic but soulless film"></head><body><p>This movie got all the looks but totally void of soul and substance. Strictly made for little kids or little kids at heart, the stardards are set pretty low here and I wondered what kind of a person would throw money away after they read this humble review.<br /><br />The special effects are pretty good, acting proves to be above par and since most of the film were shot in front of blue screen, I would say that the acting proves to be more decent then I expected. Anglina Jolie get one of the top billings although her part is quite limited. (She more like an Lara Croft in uniform.) I loved the two seat P-40 super duper fighter that become a submarine and flies forever. Its seem to be this movie version of the flying Batmobile!! The other leading actors, Gwenyth Paltow and Jude Law are likable but their characters have much substance and soul as stuff panda bears!<br /><br />Where the film failed lies in the actual plot and script. The plot is so thin that it probably won't even make it as a comic book story. The dialogue proves to be so lame that they won't even used it in the comic book!! I must respect both Paltow and Jude Law for saying some of their lines with such professionalism since its really required real acting to say some of the lamest lines with a straight face. It also pretty sad that some of the lines seem to be borrowed from other films. I kept thinking to myself during the film, "I think I heard this line before!!" The actors kept referring to "First World War", are they in the second during the movie??? (No, I don't think so but its a good example of such attention to detail this movie seem to lack - even for a science fiction movie.)<br /><br />While some of the previous reviewers called this a comic book on the movie screen, I would have to say that its less then a comic book and more like a children book overblown into a movie.<br /><br />Its without a doubt, this film got all the trappings of a bad movie. Smart characters doing dumb things just to advance the story. Silly humor spread out throughout the movie. This movie, overall, is a super lightweight science fiction flick with very few redeeming value. The appreciation level is basically along the sixth grade level. Probably make a great DVD babysitter in the future.</p></body></html>

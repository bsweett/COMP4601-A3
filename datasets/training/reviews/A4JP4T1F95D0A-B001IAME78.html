Though it is a do over, it is also really a continuation of the story.  Bruce is on the run from a very determined General Ross who wants the Hulk for military purposes.  Leading the charge is a very mean Tim Roth who is destined to become the abomination.  The action scenes are great and between the two super powers, there is lots of destruction.  I liked Norton a lot in his role.  I really would have loved to have seen more of him.  It is my hope that they will one day put out a Norton edited version of the movie(which would be much longer).  Maybe if they make nice with him, he would be willing to come back for another round.</p></body></html>

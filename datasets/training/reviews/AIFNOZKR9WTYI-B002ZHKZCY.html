The consistent rhythm of the movie is one cut every three seconds, more if there is anything actually happening.  Bourne could be sitting on a beach.  There's a cut of his profile, the seascape, the unwashed travellers parading the strand, back to Bourne, lets get an X-Ray of him so we can look at him from inside as well.  Ok, so the director is a total piece of rubbish, I say to myself.  So I have to "watch" the movie by looking away from the screen.  So  the fight scenes are covered in such a disjointed way as to make it impossible to tell who is doing what to whom at any point in time ("he's... he's got his leg... no, wait, that's not Bourne... he's... its some kind of joint lock... no, that's a lamp...) so the movie is unwatchable trash, in other words... so what? Weeeeel, it also turns out that the writing is utter drivel.  The CIA is apparently an organization with no chain of command whatsoever.  In any "meeting" - which is a loosely constituted group of three or more employees, everyone just mouths off and says the first thing that comes to mind, regardless of rank.  Nobody is in charge.  It is just a free-for-all of self-expression, with people basically just getting hot with eachother and getting emotional, saying things like, "You act like you're reading this out of a book!" and then stalking off.  I guess liberals think the entire world operates like they do.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This Movie Had It All."></head><body><p>In a lot of ways, this film was like 'A Beautiful Mind' where he lived out his spy fantasies.  The Brothers lived through all of the scary fairytales they enscribed into book form.  Some describe it as just a story to scare children, but it was much more.  There was a lot of witchcraft with the symbols involved.<br /><br />Once upon a time, in 1796, the Grimms not only wrote those scary tales, they lived through and researched them.  Many were pranks which turned dangerous, and others were full-fledged nightmares.  The peg-legged man was like the wood figurine I have had for a long time.<br /><br />Matt Damon was fabulous as Will, the good-looking Grimm and looked the part exactly.  The owl moving its head around is like the false one here near Krutch Park.  Eat your heart out, Arthur Friend.  The frisky brown mare was like those they use at the Civil War re-enactments here in Tennessee.  They lived all that stuff they wrote -- it was not a figment of their imaginations.<br /><br />In the tower in the middle of an enchanted forest in Germany, they found the Book of Spells where the ancient Queen awaited the last (twelfth) girl's death to make her young and beautiful again.  As the revived Queen, she was exactly like Poe's Ligeia.<br /><br />The French General's statesman looked like our Admiral Farragut.  Unemotional Mark Hairr of KAT fame, was at the formal dinner as they authenticated the enchantment.  The lively music for the executions as entertainment was like James Cameron's.  The ferocious wolf with the blue eyes which turned into a werewolf was Angelina's father, the suitor of the old Queen.  He seduced the young girls to a point where they were entranced by a horse who entraps them in a net and swallows them.  Sasha is saved from having to end up in the twelfth crypt which encircles the tower (looked like a lighthouse) in the German woods.<br /><br />The French Revolution was in full swing (Merci) and the boomerang axe which was enchanted, as well, was a good touch.  I liked the monkey jumping around on the mantle as they played "Lullaby and Good Night."  The ravens eating the bread crumbs of Gretel was cleverly done.  The old man with the long beard and lantern looked like Tommy.  The white horse was fab.  The German march music as we see the beautiful landscape and countryside was stirring.<br /><br />The woods were heavily populated with all kinds of fowl, snakes, toad (with his white frog's legs).  One thing I didn't like was when the trapper skinned and deblooded the skinny animal which could have been an alley cat.  Jacob did some good acting at the grass-covered spring house in the dark forest of superstition.  The strange catapalts were overcomplicated.  They used a divining fork, which they considered as sophisticated technology.<br /><br />Will contemplates life without Jacob as he struggles to reach the peak of the tower.  They find treasure in the tower room as in the Egyptian tombs.  The General's "dummy" assistant was a good actor.  Viva Revolution! Mark Savage.<br /><br />Will tells Jacob, "We can give it a happy ending."  The eclipse was the time when the Queen was rejuvenated.  The ending was overdone a bit.  They'd used cannons to set the woods on fire, and the old Queen's magic put out the fires.  They used a French flag to defend themselves against the General's sword.  Too bad it wasn't the fighting Confederate flag.<br /><br />Farewell to your tales, they will not be remembered.  Wrong!  You know the end of the story.  It was most entertaining and the special effects were nice.  We had quite a diverse audience at the showing I attended.</p></body></html>

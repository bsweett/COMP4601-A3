<meta name="summary" content="Cold War Retro Thriller..."></head><body><p>When we first meet Evelyn Salt (Angela Jolie), she is being tortured in a North Korean prison.  The CIA, thanks to the efforts of her boss (played with deadpan charm by Liev Shrieber), and her German-born boyfriend, makes a trade to get her home.<br /><br />Flash ahead two years.  Salt is married to her boyfriend, and working at an unadvertised CIA location.  A walk-in Russian defector named Orlov claims that an old Soviet KA program of deep cover assassins has been activated to kill the Russian President on a pending visit to New York City.  When the defector names Salt as a KA agent, she goes on the run, triggering an action-filled thrill ride of quick but decisive physical confrontations, nifty improvisation, and narrow escapes.<br /><br />Salt will try first to reach her husband, then the defector Orlov, before pressing on to New York City and the assassination plot.  That plot turns out to have an unexpected sequel.  Evelyn Salt is not who she seems, but neither are several other major characters.<br /><br />Under Philip Noyce's steady direction, the non-stop action and Evelyn Salt's Jason Bourne-like sense of cool keep the audience moving past some significant plot holes to a thrilling, Mission: Impossible-type finish.  "Salt" is highly recommended as an entertaining throw-back to the era of Cold War thrillers.</p></body></html>

Quentin Tarantino's clout is so noticeable in all of his movies, but he really hit it big with this one. The movies that he writes and directs (True Romance, Jackie Brown) all have such dynamic characters and actors that portray them. It is truly fascinating to watch a Tarantino film. This one took the cake though. The resevoir dogs really were tough. Steve Buscemi stole the show as Mr Pink. Tim Roth also did a fantastic performance. All of them did though. It was just an amazing movie that is probably most enjoyable (as all Tarantino films are) in a college group of friends. This is not a kid movie at all. Its R rating reflects strong graphic violence and pervasive strong language. If you can overlook that however, you're in for a real treat with Resevoir Dogs.</p></body></html>

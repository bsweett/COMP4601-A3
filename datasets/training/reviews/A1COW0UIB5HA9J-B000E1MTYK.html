<meta name="summary" content="Another great installment that soars in beautiful High-Def!"></head><body><p>It's the fourth year for Hogwarts, Harry Potter (Daniel Redcliffe) with Heromine Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grin) just saw the Quittich World Cup Finale tornument during their summer vacation until Lord Voldermort's Death Eaters trashes the place and giving a warning to the wizards and witches of the magic world. As Harry goes back to school, an upcoming TriWizard tornument is at hand soon for three schools of wizardary known as Hogwart's, Beauabatons and Durmstrang but only people who are 17 can join the tornument. A magical object called The Goblet of Fire choses who can be in the competetion as Harry has been chosen luckily to be the youngest member of the TriWizard tornument, with the help of not-so-trust worthy Professor Moody (Brendan Gleeson) with fellow student Cedric (Robert Pattison) to do 4 important task in order to become part of the match especially if he has to battle Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes).<br /><br />Co-starring Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman, Maggie Smith, Warwick Davis, Robbie Coltrane, Katie Leung, Jason Issacs, and Tom Felton  this is another outstanding installment of the Harry Potter fantasy epic saga. Sure it takes some liberties from the book as it's not as good but still great in it's own right, the acting is very improved here from the cast and here you can see Voldermort finally show up which was teased in Sorcerer's Stone. Here it gets more complex yet full of mystery and suprises galore, the special effects are very improved as well making them more belivable and there's darkness abound in this sequel. It's also about becoming mature and learning of themselves even if they have to face their own fears like Harry for instance, it's a another winner.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers the movie in sharp and perfect theatrical quality picture and wonderful sound with extras like deleted and extended scenes, featurettes, interviews, games and trailer.</p></body></html>

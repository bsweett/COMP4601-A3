The story begins with the son, William Bloom, who has moved to France with his expecting wife, Sophie. and after three years he is forced to return to the US to see his dying father, Ed, with whom he has not spoken in three years.  William is determined to find out the truth behind his father as everything that he has heard since childhood about his father has been fantastic imaginations about giants, miraculous adventures, and big mysterious fish.  However, as William returns to his childhood home the fairy tales told by his father continue, and the question is whether William will have time to find out the truth before the old man dies.  Big Fish is a powerful cinematic experience as it combines the traditional and contemporary manners of storytelling and as the tale unfolds it leaves the audience with both entertainment and notions to ponder.</p></body></html>

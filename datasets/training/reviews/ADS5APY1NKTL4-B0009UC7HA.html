"Sahara" has everything (action, romance, drama and adventure).  Matthew McConaughy plays a swarthy treasure hunter, and Steve Zahn is his delightfully goofy sidekick.  People are mysteriously dying of a disease nobody has been able to diagnose in Mali, and Dr. Rojas (Penelope Cruz) is the doctor out to get find the source.  The trio ends up brought together, running for their lives from the evil masterminds behind the infection.<br /><br />I love this film because it has the combination of droll humor, great action scenes (yes, if you love watching things being blown to smithereens, this is definitely for you!) and gorgeous cinematography.</p></body></html>

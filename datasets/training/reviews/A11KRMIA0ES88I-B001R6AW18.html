<meta name="summary" content="King Kong 1933"></head><body><p>Most classic movie of all. Movie maker Robert Armstrong hires Fay Wray to be his star. They sail to Skull Island in Indonesia where evolution has gone awry. Dinosaurs roam, and a gigantic ape rules. Natives have built a wall to contain King Kong. They capture Wray and offer her as a sacrifice. Armstrong and his crew rescue her and transport Kong to Manhattan's Great White Way as a headliner. He breaks loose and terrorizes yet another island. He climbs the Empire State Building with Wray and is riddled with bullets from planes. He falls to his death. King Kong is a film which touches modern consciousness. It shows man clashing with the nature of which he is a part. There are interracial overtones. Armstrong declares, "It was beauty killed the beast." Fay Wray lived with the film and finally accepted it as a classic.</p></body></html>

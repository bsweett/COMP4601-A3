<meta name="summary" content="Iron Man Strike Box Office GOLD!!!!!"></head><body><p>This is one of the best comic to film adaptations produced based upon a literate script, terrific performances, solid direction, and special effects that aren't over-the-top!<br /><br />I don't want to take this kind of entertainment too seriously, so I will not go with the long summary of the plot and simply give a quick recap of it and what I liked best and least about this totally fun-filled film.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr. is NOT the kind of person anyone would expect to play a superhero and that is precisely why this film works so well in casting him as one as his character is the total opposite of a superhero at first.  Downey, as Tony Stark, is a self-absorbed jerk who lives for fast women, fast cars and fast money while profiteering off of war.  He is the living example of why we don't want unmanned aircraft bombers.  We want the human element.  We don't want war to be reduced to a video game and have lives reduced to a blimp on a screen, but this is how Stark lives when we first meet him.  He creates weapons of mass destruction without ever understanding or caring about his weapons' impact on the world, let alone who ends up with them.  It's the all mighty dollar hidden under the cloak of patriotism.<br /><br />This all changes when Stark is kidnapped in Afghanistan and sees how his weapons are falling into enemy hands and how the lives of innocent people are affected by his "toys."  Once he escapes, he slowly becomes a new man, in more ways than one and it's nice that he's a hero by choice and not some experiment gone.  Stark is assisted by a number of people from his glorified secretary well-played by Gwenyth Paltrow to his military connection nicely acted by Terrence Howard.  Of course, it is no secret at this point, and very highly predictable anyhow, that his family's best friend and second in command at his company is out to circumvent Stark's efforts to stop bloodshed.  Jeff Bridges hams it up some in this role, but he's convincing and fun as the eventual villain.<br /><br />The Misses:<br /><br />1) This material, as entertaining as it is, is beneath Paltrow who is a very serious actress and should be doing things far worthier of her talents.<br /><br />2) The plot element of the family friend running the business for personal gain is far too reminiscent of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNJV">Batman Begins</a>.<br /><br />The Hits:<br />1) There are only two significant "misses" with this film and, to be honest, they aren't all that significant (just enough for me to note them)<br /><br />2) The casting is perfect and inspired.  While I believe that Paltrow is better than this kind of film, she gives a very spirited performance.  Downey is just down right perfect for the this flawed hero and Bridges is just plain fun in his juicy role.<br /><br />3) The special effects DO NOT take over this film, as they did in the equally fun, but over-the-top <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR0570">Transformers</a>.<br /><br />4) The direction is confident and unobtrusive which I can't say for a film such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UR9T8C">Spider-Man 3</a> which was directed well enough, but Sam Rami just tried a little too hard to put his stamp so-to-speak on it.<br /><br />5) This film is entertaining, but not in the kind of mindless way that other superhero films have been.  This film has some heart and soul.<br /><br />6) I can't say enough about the literate script for this film.  It can be funny one moment and cerebral the next.  That is tough to do in this comic book adaptation genre.  It usually goes too much one way in seriousness as with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICM5W6">Hulk</a> or too slapstick silly as with too many moments in Spider-Man 3.  This film finds a comfortable balance between serious and humorous.<br /><br />This is an outstanding film and I look forward to the two sequels that are currently planned for this new comic book hero to make it to the silver screen.</p></body></html>

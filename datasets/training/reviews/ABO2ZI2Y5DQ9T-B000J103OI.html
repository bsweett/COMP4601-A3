<meta name="summary" content="My Boss Is Meryl Streep -- Great Acting But the Film Is Average Otherwise"></head><body><p>The title of the film (based on the bestselling novel which I have not read) refers to a New York fashion magazine editor named Miranda Priestly. This devil, I mean, Miranda, is played by Meryl Streep who is in top form, bringing the film itself one or two notches above other Hollywood comedies. Whether or not you like her dragon-lady character, you will be impresses with her turn, one of her best in a decade. or maybe two.<br /><br />I must add that Anne Hathaway is also very good as Andy, a na?ve career girl in New York who scored a job as the second assistant to Miranda. For Andy it as only a stepping stone to be a journalist, but while doing the thankless jobs for Miranda, she is gradually attracted to the world which she initially despised.<br /><br />Miranda never misses a chance to reveal her (perversely) cynical view on everything which she dislikes, and the way she makes her acid comments on them has a certain kind of unforgettable taste that is either repulsive or irresistible, or both. The sado-masochistic relations between her and Andy keeps you interested in the film's otherwise predictable story, even though anyone with level-headed mind (like Andy) would not usually turn down the opportunity to learn at a first-rate law school in order to be ill-treated by Miranda. As Stanley Tucci's fashion director says, why not quit?<br /><br />In spite of superb acting from Streep and Hathaway, and the critical praises heaped on the film, I find `The Devil Wears Prada' left much to be desired. The script is almost auto-pilot when the main characters do not share the screen. In fact the career success of Andy (if I may call her `success' that way) owes much to incredible luck; she is lucky to have a capable fashion director Nigel (Stanley Tucci) at hand when she wants it, and an entire wardrobe for them to use for that matter; she is lucky to know a writer working for another prestigious New York magazine Christian (Simon Baker) who can help her out when Miranda asks Andy to obtain something very rare (actually, no one but J. K. Rowling can). There is something cosy and (if I may so) superficial about the film's attitudes to the works Andy is trying to do, something that prevents the film from becoming a really biting comedy that it could have been.<br /><br />There is one impressive scene showing why Meryl Streep is a great actress who is not afraid of being truly in character. I do not say when and how she shows it because it is the only surprise I got while watching `The Devil Wears Prada.' The film is enjoyable with the great performances of the two leads, the beautiful locations of the city and the fashionable costumes, but it could still have been better with just something more than another take of success story, and some more scenes looking under the surface of the people working for this fashion industry.</p></body></html>

Since then the comic books have become enormously popular, but I've not kept up or knew much about it at all.<p>I have fond memories of the clever, creative series and it quickly took the place of the mid 60's Superman, Batman, DC Gang comic books. But I grew out of comic books and I've not been overly nostalgic looking back at them. Oh sure I've wandered into comic book collector stores and peaked at a few old issues, stuff I remember having as a kid.... <p>  X MEN <p>I'm sure not having a strong recollection of any story line and barely recalling some of the characters was a plus in my enjoying the 'surprises' of the film. I found the film wonderfully cast. Patrick Stewart makes a great Professor Xavier. Though Wolverine I understand is basically a dwarf in the comics, I don't think much is lost by having him full sized in the film. Ian McKellan plays a pretty old Magneto (but whow cares? he's having a good time and so are we).<p>They did a wonderful job with it I thought. At times the film was almost touching, and without slowing down the fast pace of its character introductions, plot mechanics or action.<p>Unfortunately, when you come to the end you realize the huge hurdle that any of these movies face. You want to end a movie like this, satisfying the audience but leaving them wanting a little more. <p>Of course there's no mystery about the wanting a little more part. The movie was done well, it will do good box office and so there will of course be a sequel. The lead actors have agreements in place to be in a couple of sequels, though director Singer isn't a sure thing. There will be another X Men movie,probably within a couple years. So the movie isn't exactly complete because unlike a movie where you aren't sure if there will be a sequel or not, you already know not only will the film  continue, it's already in several of the actors contracts. So they don't have to wrap everything up, they can have characters rush off to find themselves and not show us or tell us a thing about it, because there's gonna be a sequel. <p>I enjoyed the humor, the relationships, the special effects. The darker parts of the story I thought all were well balanced and the film didn't stop dead as we explored some disturbing revelations (as happened in the Batman films for instance). Because of the intelligent script and good acting the film isn't as shallow as most comic books to the screen conversions have been. <p>The film has some drawbacks. It was pretty much the Wolverine story, and several characters were given short shrift. Halle Berry was given almost nothing to do with her character of Storm. The reaction of the character to situations was also very slow. Berry's casting and performance may be the weakest thing about the film, but the script gave her so little to do it's impossible to determine if she would have been good were the part better written for her. <p>Some of the wire work stunt scenes were fairly obvious, but I much prefer this style of filmed stunts than CGI. I get a sense real people are doing the action scene and acrobatics at least part of the time, rather than most of it being computer generated.<p>It was a real drawback that we never see Cyclops and Jean interact as a couple to know how 'special' their relationship is. If we had, the triangle would have worked much better.<p>Bruce Davison who plays the Senator is usually very enjoyable in whatever he does, and he's quite good here and deserves a mention. <p>Bryan (Usual Suspects) Singer has directed one of the most  enjoyable, comic book movies I've ever seen and I anticipate many successful sequels (particularly if he agrees to direct another).<p>Now give me 80 or 90 mil, and a collection of Green Lantern books to refresh my memory and I'll turn it into a great 2 hour and 20 minute movie. C'mon...<p>Chris Jarmick, Author (The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder-a steamy cyber- thriller ...)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Morally Deranged Film."></head><body><p>_Mr. Brooks_ is a film which glorifies killing.  The killing in this film is not done for a higher purpose, it is not done in self-defense, it is done purely "for pleasure".  Kevin Costner, who plays the killer, is made to appear cool and suave.  His character is made to appear likeable and noble.  As such, I cannot recommend this film because I find its general premise disgusting.</p></body></html>

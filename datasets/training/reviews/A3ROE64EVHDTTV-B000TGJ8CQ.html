<meta name="summary" content="And Then...?"></head><body><p>The Good Things<br />*Very cool action and special effects.  The movie's main concept makes for some very interesting, memorable scenes.<br />*Camermanship is very smooth, slick, and use some very cool colors.<br />*The storyline generally works.<br />*Characters are not bad.  Jessica Beil's character stands out very well; she is awesome.<br />*Good, original production design.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*The ending!!! What happens next?! Are they going to make sequels or what?!<br />*Not sure if it's accurate to the original story (then again, every adaptation of PKD tends to be different for some odd reason...).<br /><br />I didn't expect much, but this film turned out to be very slick.  The action and effects are smashing, and jive really well with the central idea.  The whole movie is engaging, but not hyper or overdone.  The only bad weakness is the end (don't you just hate those endings when the main character wakes up and it turned out to be a dream? Ugh).  However, if they intend on making sequels, this would be a promising start.  I would gladly reccomend this to action or sci-fi fans.</p></body></html>

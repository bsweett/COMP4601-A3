It gave me the feeling like I was sitting down with good old king and reading a short story. His original short story is about 200 pages but I was really thrilled when they signed on john tuturro and johnny depp. Perfect method actors. I swear, I watch this one over and over again. It's another one of those writer's block movies that turns into a psychological thriller. You'll love the ending. "The only thing that matters is the ending. It's the most important part of the story, the ending. and this one is very good. This one is perfect."</p></body></html>

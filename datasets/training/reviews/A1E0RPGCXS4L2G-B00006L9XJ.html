<meta name="summary" content="Another Classic Western"></head><body><p>Any movie starring Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris has got to be good.  But I must admit upon first viewing of this movie I was initially a bit let down.  As I watched I had trouble coming to terms with my childhood western hero Clint Eastwood being an old broken down, retired killer that couldn't even mount his own horse.  The plot is the normal revenge plot in two different ways. <p>First, the aging killers (Eastwood & Freeman) team up with a young kid who is all talk to collect a bounty on two cowboys that cut up a local woman of the night.  But when Ned (Freeman) loses the stomach for the killing he rides away.  And his caught by the Sheriff Little Bill (Hackman) and beat to death.  Upon hearing this news William Money (Eastwood) decides that it is time to get drunk and revert to the his old ways.  <p>It is here where we see the Clint Eastwood of old and the revenge style, lone wolf, western movie that made his career as he takes his revent on Little Bill and the town.  <p>The movie picked up pace about mid way and my initial let down faded fast as I realized where the movie was heading and the fact that the beginning was needed to set up the great ending.  Once again Clint has turned in a classic western. <p>The characters portrayed in this movie feel very real.  You can connect with them and sympathize with them, even when they are killing folks or being killed.  <p>A great movie and classic western!</p></body></html>

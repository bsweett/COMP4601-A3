<meta name="summary" content="Excellent shocker, very effective"></head><body><p>A good Stephen King adaptation can make for a great film and while this is no Shawshank Redemption, it stands as a strong horror movie and one with a very creepy atmosphere and some great, jump in your seats moments.<br /><br />John Cusack's performance holds this film together and he is very impressive as a writer whose job involves exposing haunting as fake. His cynical hack attitude makes the rising tension that much more effective. We see someone doubting his sanity and beliefs as the things he sees appear increasingly impossible.<br /><br />Samuel L Jackson gives strong support as the hotel manager who tries to persuade him against staying in the cursed room. This is a very good shocker, strongly recommended.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></body></html>

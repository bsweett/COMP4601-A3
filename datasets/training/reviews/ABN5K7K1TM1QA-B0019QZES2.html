<meta name="summary" content="Fockerizing the CIA?"></head><body><p>So as I left the theater I was thinking, how funny you think this film is depends a lot on how old you are, and who you are, and who you identify with in the stratified society.  If you are a couple of New Aging hippies nostalgic for the summer of love and your lost libido, you gotta love it.  But if you are Oliver North or Dick Cheney, welding loose cannons or loose nukes--whatever--this has got to be some kind of insult to American manhood.<br /><br />Anyway, there was this carnival guy in the lobby with a pink top hat and a big red nose and a microphone getting comments--for publicity I guess.  "DID YA MEET THE FOCKERS? he says, eyes wide.  Most people ignore him but some guy in a NASCAR baseball cap says:<br /><br />"Yeah, I met 'em and the Byrnes too.  I wasn't too impressed.  They're kinda gay and touchie-feelie.  So fock off, would you?"<br /><br />He and his bud crack up.<br /><br />An older woman says in passing, "Bobbie De Niro used to be such a fine actor.  And so handsome.  Now look what they've done to him.  Oy ve!  But Bah-bra.  Wasn't she divine!  She is sooo good at comedy.  So funny, so natural."<br /><br />"Perfect casting," her friend says.<br /><br />One teenaged boy says, "Yeah, dude, just like Frankie's parents.  You know Frankie Rigotelli...I mean crack me up like wow it was so, so identical, I mean identical.  Dude, like when he f..in' kisses him on the neck like he wants blood or something.  I mean, dude, it was bogus."<br /><br />His buddy says, "Teri Polo is hot."<br /><br />"Yeah, I'd like to--."<br /><br />Never mind.<br /><br />A pregnant woman with her husband, beaming: "We loved it. So funny and the little boy was just adorable, wasn't he, honey?"<br /><br />"Adorable."<br /><br />An old guy in a World War II red hat with gold scrambled egg on the bill, snarls, "No retired CIA operative would stand for that.  It's just not natural.  That's not the way he would act.  He'd, he'd...take control of the situation.  Dustin Hoffman's a p--y.  He can't knock Robert De Niro down.  That's as phony as a three-dollar bill."<br /><br />"'Meet the Parents' was better," a woman says to the guy she's with.<br /><br />"Yeah, but the kid was adorable."<br /><br />"Adorable."<br /><br />So I thought, what did I think of the movie?  Well, you have two of the most outstanding actors of our time, De Niro and Dustin Hoffman in it (totally miscast, of course).  But they do a good job anyway.  You have a really fine performance by Barbra Steisand.  She is just perfect as a sex therapist for seniors.  Seems like she was born for the part.  And yes, Bradley Pickren as the boy whose first spoken word is "a--hole" is as cute as cute can be.  And what is more, they did a great job of getting all those expressions out of him on film and then splicing them in at exactly the right spot.<br /><br />But I wonder if this is director Jay Roach's best work.  My laugh-o-meter says no.  I understand the prequel Meet the Parents (2000) which also starred De Niro and Ben Stiller (but no Dustin Hoffman or Barbra Steisand) was funnier, but I haven't seen it so I can't say.  I did see one of the Austin Powers movies that Roach directed and it was very funny.<br /><br />A warning: some straight-laced types might find this movie a bit creepy.  After all, the Fockers are parents who have a trophy wall for their son showing off his ninth or tenth place ribbons for whatever along with his jock strap, framed.  On the other hand, I think young people might get some chuckles laughing at people who remind them of their parents.  And, for some aging hippies this might come off as a very warm movie.  There's a happy ending in which the uptight learn to loosen up a bit, and they did, as Barbra Streisand's character says, "Fockerize" De Niro's Jack Byrnes, who is a retired CIA agent.<br /><br />So bottom line is chill out.  This is a comedy and if you don't feel Fockerized, well, then you can just--<br /><br />Never mind.  But remember, "If it's yellow, let it mellow, and if it's brown, flush it down."</p></body></html>

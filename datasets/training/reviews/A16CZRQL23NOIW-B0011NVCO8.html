<meta name="summary" content="The raise and fall of Frank Lucas"></head><body><p>"American gangster" is a zealous and well detailed chronicle about the slow spark of a cold blooded gangster, whose chess player mind and terrible childhood makes of him a ruthless boss.<br /><br />On the other hand we will have an ethical agent whose bullet proof honesty simply is out of range respect the 75% of his colleagues in the anti drugs office.<br /><br />In fact, Scott makes a breakthrough respect the previous fast paced thrillers of the genre to focus in the interiorities of this unknown citizen who builds a true empire of his illegal business thanks to his contacts in Bangkok.<br /><br />Evidently, you will realize there are previous traces of similar films like " Serpico", " French connection ", "Prince of the city" and a smooth breeze of " The Godfather I " .<br /><br />The fine performances of Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are by far, the main pillars of this absorbing and overlong movie.</p></body></html>

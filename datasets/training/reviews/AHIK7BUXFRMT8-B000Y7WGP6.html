<meta name="summary" content="An Action Film with Insight"></head><body><p>This is an out and out action film; my wife walked out after the first few minutes and didn't come back. I'll agree that it is violent but in the situations this film addresses, violence can and should be expected.<br /><br />The film provides some interesting insights into life in the Middle East; although I've never been there, news reports and video clips over the past several years seem to confirm the use of violence as a negotiating tool. Life in the Middle East, and especially in Saudi Arabia, reflects a worldview that is diametrically opposed to Western thought.<br /><br />The film is fast paced and moves toward an ending that even increases the pace of the action. As the film closes one is left with statements from both sides that indicate the struggle will continue; it is not just the individuals that are in opposition, but two opposing worldviews.<br /><br />Historians who address this struggle are quick to point out the fact that the battle has been going on for centuries with greater or lesser intensity. It appears that the level of intensity has been increasing again for several years now.<br /><br />The confrontations described in "The Kingdom" will not be going away any time soon, sadly to say.</p></body></html>

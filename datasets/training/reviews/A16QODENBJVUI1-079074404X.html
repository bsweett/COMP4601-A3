<meta name="summary" content="Fun = Freud, Shakespeare, and Space"></head><body><p>As is well known, this is a Sci-fi film loosely based on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST meeting Freud's theories of the Id.  But this would count for nothing if the film weren't so extremely well done in other ways.  <p>Although not working with an especially large budget, the makers of the film combined a good story with amazingly innovative set design and clever special effects to produce what is possibly the most satisfying film set in outer space film made during the 1950s.  Shot entirely on a soundstage, the exterior shots of the planet manage to avoid looking at all hokey, and the house in which Dr. Morbius and his daughter Altaira live, despite looking pure 1950s, manages to somehow seem right at home.  The shots of the interior of the former inhabitants' magnificent structures are some of the best model shots in film history.  Even with today's special effects and CGI scripting, they are impressive.  And Robby the Robot has to go down as one of the great screen robots of all time.  Also among the all time greats, the invisible but nonetheless detectable "monster from the ID" is one of the most satisfying monsters one could imagine.  Almost all movie monsters from the fifties disappoint, at seem to some degree a bit silly, but not this one.  <p>Part of the reason the movie works so well is the cast, which is a cut above average for a fifties Sci-fi flick.  Leslie Nielsen was thirty years away from his debut as a comedian, and plays what was his usual character for the first half of his film career:  a solid if a bit too serious lead.  Walter Pidgeon turns in the strongest performance in the film, as the brilliant Dr. Morbius.  His voice alone makes many of the key scenes in the film work beautifully.  Anne Francis is simply beautiful, and it doesn't take much imagination the effect she would have on a ship full of men who haven't seen a woman in several months.  She manages to be incredibly sexy and completely innocent as successfully as any actress I have ever seen.<p>One can overstress the Shakespeare and Freud connection, but this film does get my vote for the best use of psychology ever made in a Sci-fi film.  It along with the extreme care given to every aspect of this film make it to this day one of the most durable Sci-fi films ever made.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kids Can Be Cruel"></head><body><p>Now you want to talk about kids being cruel?  This would be the type of movie that would make a parent want to homeschool their daughter.  I got quite a kick out of Stephen King's creation with this one. I shook my head through the "plug it up" scene and the pig's blood screaming scene. This horror movie about an outcast girl who just could not manage to be accepted by the popular kids held my attention through the whole thing.  Do I think it was scary? Not even remotely.  Entertaining? Definitely.</p></body></html>

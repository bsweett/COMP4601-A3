<meta name="summary" content="American Gangster"></head><body><p>Based on a true story 'American Gangster' takes us on another gangster style journey, but made refreshing as not based around the Mob or Italian stereotypes. As other reviewers here have noted, this film stands out by the great performances of both Washington and Crowe and they both add depth and flair to their respective roles. I was hooked in the first ten minutes and although Washington plays a flawed character, you can't help but like him. Excellently directed and with great supporting actors as well, this film managed to hold my attention for the duration. If you like crime and gangster films then this rates pretty highly and is well worth a look and even if you're not a fan of these films this has enough on offer to appeal to everyone else as well. A solid four star film.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

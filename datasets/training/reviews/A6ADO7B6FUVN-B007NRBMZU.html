<meta name="summary" content="Chaos Theory and Time Traveling in Ok Cinematic Experience"></head><body><p>The theory that a butterfly's wing in Asia can cause a Hurricane in the Caribbean is called the Chaos Theory.  Butterfly Effect is based on the Chaos Theory and time traveling, which has been introduced in several other science fiction books and films.  Nonetheless, Butterfly Effect is not a science fiction film as it incorporates these two fundamental elements of philosophical thinking that are often connected with the future and progressive philosophy.<br /><br />Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) has memory lapses as a child through some severely distressing moments. Evan's mother becomes very concerned as she finds out that he has begun to display some bizarre traits in school and at home.  The mother is also concerned as Evan's father is institutionalized in a highly secure clinic and she is worried that Evan might begin to show the same traits as his father.  This leads the mother to contact a psychiatrist, who instructs Evan to begin to write a daily journal.<br /><br />Years later when Evan attends college as a psychology honors student he begins to have flashes of his past.  Evan returns to his childhood town to find out more about his past and he finds that his friends also suffer from the past traumatic events.  It troubles Evan that he and his friends endure deep emotional pain, which leads him to read his old journals in order to find a solution to the problems.  The reading opens Pandora's Box as he realizes that he can return to the past and change the future.<br /><br />Butterfly Effect has interesting premise, however, it falls short as it gives a serious attempt to depict two interesting philosophical notions.  The reasons for its shortcomings are the numerous plot holes and blunders in the story.  The film, at times, seems rushed and hurried as appropriate channels were not consulted before shooting several of the scenes.  This results in several awkward moments that are enhanced by the lead in the film.  Butterfly Effect begins extremely promising, but lands far from a great cinematic experience as the end credits roll.</p></body></html>

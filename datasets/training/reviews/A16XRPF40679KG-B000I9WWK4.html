<meta name="summary" content="five star movie without blu ray extras"></head><body><p>This is a classic movie that really looks great on blu ray.  The only problem is that Universal decided not put deleted scenes and other extras on it. There is no excuse for not putting the same extras that a special edition has on a blu ray because the price is the same.  SO the movie gets five stars, the transfer looks great but you just don't get any extras.  At this price you should get all of the extras that a special edition has.  This flick though remains one of the best sci fi movies ever made and it's just too bad that they decided to remove any decent extras.</p></body></html>

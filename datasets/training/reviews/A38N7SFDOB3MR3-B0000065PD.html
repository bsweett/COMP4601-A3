<meta name="summary" content="Ultimate Edition? Review of DVD features only"></head><body><p>I love Stargate, and give the movie 5 stars. I own a VHS copy, and have watched it many times.<br /><br />With that said this "Ultimate Edition" is not ultimate at all. There are no real special features. The documentary is a cheesy one that explores if there is a real stargate, but there are no...NO...behind the scenes/making of Star Gate insights at all. This documentary has nothing to do with the cast/crew/design/production of the movie. This does not, by any means, make this DVD ultimate. This DVD edition isn't ultimate at all, but extremely mediocre.<br /><br />The only special feature on this disk is a producer/director audio commentary that can run during the movie. That's it. Really. No kidding.</p></body></html>

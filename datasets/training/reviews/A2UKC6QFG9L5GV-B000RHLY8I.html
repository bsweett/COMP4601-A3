I don't know whether to feel for Cage's character or resent him. Anyway the movie leaves an uneasy feeling after itself which seemed a bit strange and not usual for a relatively big-budget, major hollywood film. You can't even tell if it has a happy ending or not.<br /><br />"Lord of War" is totally truthful, maybe some things were slightly exaggerated, but in general I think noone will have doubts that all shown in film is exactly the way it is in real life. Being myself from Russia I can tell all the parts about selling Russian and Ukranian arms are true, after the Soviet Union fell to pieces there were immense amounts of tanks, cannons, different weapons and ammunition stolen and sold nobody knows where to. Well, not only 15 years ago - there are lots of weapons being stolen and sold nowdays in Russia. In every country that's at war (and Russia now is at war with Chechnia) there are many possibilities to earn money selling guns.<br /><br />The only thing that was not truthful in the film is HOW Russia and its people were shown. It just made me laugh, I recalled old American movies of a cold-war period that depicted Russians in a very funny way. Actually noone talks like that and behaves like that. But if you've never been here I think it looks just fine. I've never been to Africa, and African scenes looked fine to me although now I think they might also have some flaws.<br /><br />Generally speaking "Lord of War" is about choices we make, and it demonstrates vividly how these choices affect our lives on business and personal level. About acting I have to say Nicolas Cage is doing his usual work, nothing extraordinary, Jared Leto - the same story. But I was blown away by Ethan Hawke - he's totally believable, seems like he's a real interpol agent put on screen.<br /><br />I think it's difficult not to like this movie - it's too serious, thought-provoking and powerful. Definately worth a look.</p></body></html>

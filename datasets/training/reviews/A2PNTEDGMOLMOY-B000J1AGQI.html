<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie; Good Extras"></head><body><p>&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; is a U-turn for American films about Vietnam.  For years, the best flicks about the war highlighted the nation's disillusionment and cynicism about our involvement in Southeast Asia -- &quot;Apocalypse Now,&quot; &quot;Platoon,&quot; &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; and &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; leave the viewer bereft, wondering how to deal with that ball of ice in your stomach.  But each of these films looks back with regret, wtih &quot;if we only knew the truth at the beginning, we wouldn't have gotten involved over there in that hideous war.&quot;  <p>&quot;We Were Soldiers,&quot; on the other hand, captures the America at the beginning of the Vietnam conflict.  Most of the soldiers are the earnest, happy-go-lucky young guys we got in the John Wayne war films . . . before they go off to war, they sing and dance with their wives and girlfriends, and they show an innocent heroism under fire.  Only the senior officers, played by Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott, know the truth about war and how savage the Vietnam conflict will be. Mel, as the senior commander, gets a bit jingoistic at times, but that his depiction is apparently dead-on for those who know the real-life commander (who was a consultant on the film).  Sam Elliott, as the grizzled second-in-command, is a wonder -- he stalks the movie with a barely concealed fury, terrifying his own soldiers, but has a moment of exquisite tenderness and leadership with one of his boys.  <p>Like the young soldiers, the audience gets its education on how the conflict will be -- the Vietnamese, who are given a humanity rarely seen in Vietnam movies, still charge with near-suicidal determination.  We see napalm in its hideous applications.  We see the terror of a unit cut off from the main force overnight.  We are stunned by seeing what men can endure and we despair because no man should have to experience the hell of that battlefield.  <p>The movie truly shines with its parallel storyline of the wives and girlfriends back in Georgia who wait for news of their loved ones in combat . . . or, more accurately, pray that they do not receive news.  The movie's most touching scenes revolve around the delivery of the &quot;We regret to inform you . . . &quot; telegrams announcing the death of another soldier to their families.  Anyone who can watch these scenes without heartache has not heart.<p>The DVD also contains some nice extras, including deleted scenes with director's commentary.  It's always interesting to hear why certain scenes didn't make it into a good story, and while some of the deleted scenes were quite good, it's hard to quibble with the explanation.</p></body></html>

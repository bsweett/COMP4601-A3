<meta name="summary" content="What a strange film"></head><body><p>I've seen this film a zillion times in my local shop, and finally decided to get it, due my Dad showing an interest in it. I'd never heard of Pinhead before - just knew of his face due to seeing it on the DVD! <p>I actually enjoyed this film, but I doubt I would ever watch it again. It's a one-time only film I thought. I found it extremely dated, but that's only to be expected. It was quite hilarious looking at Julie's (Clare Higgins) outrageous makeup, multi-coloured eyeshadow right up to the eyebrows! Oh, the 80s. What a decade.<p>I didn't really find it that scary - gory more than anything. There was a certain scene (where Kirsty's - Ashley Laurence - character is in hospital, and starts playing with the box) that reminded me of Labyrinth slightly. She was running through a seemingly endless corridor, whereas Jennifer Connolly was running through a maze. <p>Clare Higgins was extremely familiar - she had one of those faces. I've looked at what she's done, but she hasn't done anything I recognise, so I guess she reminds me of someone from Neighbours/Prisoner, or some other Australian show! She had that kinda look about her!<p>For all you film score fanatics out there, Christopher Young (Sweet November) does a brilliant score to this. It's not that intrusive, as any good score should be, and it highlights all the good parts of the movie.<p>So I liked this film - that means someone out there is removing it from their wishlist right about ... now!</p></body></html>

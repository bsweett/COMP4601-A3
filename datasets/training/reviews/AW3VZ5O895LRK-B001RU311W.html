<meta name="summary" content="I Liked MILK but I Didn't Love It"></head><body><p>Sean Penn does his usual first class acting job playing Harvey Milk.  He is also given great competition by Josh Brolin playing Dan White. Directed by Gus Van Sant, this film is the biography of Harvey Milk, a gay rights activist decades ago in San Francisco, who rose to considerable political power.  Milk and the mayor of San Francisco were assassinated by Dan White, a conservative straight man who was also on the board of supervisors along with Harvey.  I couldn't help compare this film with the documentary made about Milk in 1984, "The Times of Harvey Milk." The problem is that the film does the same job as the documentary.  It covers in literal and linear fashion, the ascendance and destruction of Harvey Milk.  The film does not try anything new and visionary in telling a biography like Oliver Stone did with "The Doors."  Still, Van Sant does nothing wrong telling the tale and also has first class actors to play the tale.  One thing the film does convey is the hope that Harvey Milk brought to gay people for gay rights in this country.  It seems in retrospect a lot more innocent time for gays, a time when there was hope for coming out and being accepted in the not so distant future.  One cannot say that about present day.  It is amazing  how close California came back then to being the first state to fully accept gays. Today California just rejected these very same gays in a statewide proposition on the ballot.</p></body></html>

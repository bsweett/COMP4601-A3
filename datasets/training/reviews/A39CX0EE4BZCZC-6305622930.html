<meta name="summary" content="Scott Delivers Memorable Performance"></head><body><p>This is a long but interesting character study of a real-life person: General George S. Patton, probably the most famous military men of World War II.  Over the years, better DVD transfers of this film keep coming out and now we have a great Blu-Ray version. It just gets better and better!<br /><br />How much of this story is fact and how much is fiction, I don't know. Knowing Hollywood and knowing when this was made - during the heyday of the anti-war (Vietnam) movement - I have my suspicions but  WWII buffs I've talked to pretty much  back up this film.  Whatever political bias a filmmaker might have, Patton made for a good movie subject anyway and the story is interesting all the way, thanks to the acting of George C. Scott, who was astounding as Patton. He gives us one of the more memorable performances ever by an actor.<br /><br />Not only is Scott's acting superb, the widescreen photography is also good. Thank goodness DVDs came out so films like this could be seen in the aspect ratio in which they were filmed.  As for special-effects, the explosions and machine-gun fire was realistic, especially for a film that is now approaching 40 years old.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if you enjoy character studies, this is one of the best. Patton's opening 6-minute speech before this huge American flag is a famous scene in movie history. That, and the rest of his performance and this movie in general, is one you won't forget.</p></body></html>

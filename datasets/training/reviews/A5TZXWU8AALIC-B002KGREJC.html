It delivers on nothing.  No laughs, no nudity, no fun.  The scenes in that movie only insult the viewer as it plods along in excessive bad language and mind-numbing pointlessness.<br /><br />Then I watched JUNO.  Quirky dialogue, interestingly apolotical plot, genuine characters, refreshingly involving scenes.  Wow, what a difference.  It's a fine Indie-styled comedy-drama that just happens to center on a teenage girl.  I'm definitely not a fan of the minimalist folk soundtrack but...it fits this movie.  And didn't keep me from enjoying it.<br /><br />Worth seeing.</p></body></html>

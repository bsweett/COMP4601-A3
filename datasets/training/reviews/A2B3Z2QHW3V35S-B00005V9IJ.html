And you never know where the airplane will crash. Specially if it crashes in the water. I don't know how to swim. But either way this movie was interesting on all the way's he came up with to stay alive for four years.  But once he was found and went back home it is real sad that his long time girl friend, Kelly, was now married and they had a child. Kelly is the one thing that kept him alive for four years. Now that he is back you can see in Kelly eyes that she wishes she could leave her husband for her true love. But it wasn't going to happen. In the end it seemed he was going to find love in another woman.</p></body></html>

In some parts of the world, they don't even have that much.  The title of Eastern Promises relates to people who know happiness doesn't exist in their neighborhood, people whose only hope for a richer, fuller life (or even simply one of content) lies in the West.  The future of promise of those from the East (Russia) grows from stories of America, London and the other major cities of the West.  But all too often, the promise is unfulfilled, as played out in the latest David Cronenberg/Viggo Mortensen collaboration.<br /><br />The diary of a fourteen year old sex slave haunts Eastern Promises.  Her last action on earth was to deliver a child to an idealistic midwife (Naomi Watts), who takes it upon herself to see the child is cared for and to understand more about the young mother.  The more she searches, the uglier the truth becomes, as the pages of her diary recount her plight in the underground prostitution trade from the poorest parts of Russia to the seedy communities in London controlled by Russian mobsters.  Stories of beatings, rapes and forced abortions pale in comparison to the heart-breaking dreams she had about the West, and how those romantic notions were crushed by the ugly truth of her life in London.<br /><br />The girl's diary directs the nurse to one Russian mob family in particular, lead by a charismatic fatherly figure who feigns compassion for the dead girl.  Watts has an encounter with the old man's driver (Mortensen), the central figure in Eastern Promises, a man who quickly becomes torn between the life he knows and what he knows to be right.  When faced with the opportunity to do right by the dead girl, Mortensen distances himself from all responsibility.  As he says, he's just the driver.<br /><br />The resulting story contains tricky twists and dramatic (often brutal) encounters.  As with the last Cronenberg/Viggo film, Eastern Promises is so much more than the violence on screen or even the story it tells.  The film speaks to larger issues about the state of the world, and the responsibility of people in the West to continue being more than just a "promise" of a brighter day and a new tomorrow.</p></body></html>

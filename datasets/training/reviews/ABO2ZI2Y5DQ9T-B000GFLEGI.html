<meta name="summary" content="Real Come Back of George A. Romero (And It's Major Studio): Slick and Gory Entertainment"></head><body><p>And gorefest.  George A. Romero has come back with a slick horror film with some clever ideas in it.  Though the story itself is not original, Romero successfully gives several twists to it, making the whole film good, solid entertainemt with his trademark satires (which are greatly helped by dark humor).<br /><br />Unlike the last year's remake of 'Dawn of the Dead,' the film avoids the humans vs the undead formula.  Instead the humans are living in a sanctuary city 'Fiddler's Green' where Dennis Hopper's magnate Kaufman virtually reigns (like exectives in black suit), and mercenaries are hired to 'pillage' food, drink, and other things from the towns outside where the zombies roam in the traditional way (oh, and this time, they don't run.)<br /><br />[REVENGE OF THE ZOMBIES] we learn that one zombie 'Big Daddy' couldn't stand it.  Believe it or not, he starts to learn how to use weapons, and leads a troop of fellow zombies to Fiddler's Green. Besides this gory battles between humans and zombies, there is a conflict between humans (well, that's the new part) between a hard-nosed mercenary Cholo (John Leguizamo) fed up with the life of doing dirty works, Kaufman (with Hopper's usual mannerism as baddie), and another mercenary and our reluctant hero Riley (Simon Baker).  Asia Argento and Robert Joy also appear, offering help to Simon Baker's character.<br /><br />The script is fine, if not superb, but anyway Romero is a great storyteller, so this story will do.  He also knows how to entertain and surprise us with timely editing and occasional sly humor, so even when the familiar gimmicks are employd (like a zombie hiding somewhere and coming out suddenly, or the camera panning to and fro suggesting something is hiding there), the results are different, mostly better than imitators' tricks.<br /><br />Prodution designs and photography are both good, and some scenes are really memorable (my favorite: 'scared' zombies). But probably the success of the film is due to the good acting from Baker, Joy, Argento, Leguizamo and Hopper.  Considering the numbers of the people (or extras) eaten by the zobmies, surprisingly many main characters survive in the end, and this may suggest the studio is considering a sequel.  If so, I heartily welcome the decision, and am ready to see it.  And thank you Mr. Romero, this is what we wanted to see.</p></body></html>

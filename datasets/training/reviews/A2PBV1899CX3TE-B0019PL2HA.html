<meta name="summary" content="The Triumph of Will (Ferrell)"></head><body><p>Will Ferrell and crew are really firing on all cylinders here. Anchorman was funny in bursts and spurts, same for Old School, but this one keeps up the fevered comedic pace up to the checkered flag.<br /><br />It makes fun of the French, Jazz Music, and friends of Dorothy, but also makes fun of NASCAR, Rednecks, KFC, Taco Bell, and Applebee's, but in such a way that even the people or things being spoofed would enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Dennis Miller has not been funny for a long time, and I remember he tried to make a joke about the Dixie Chicks, and how their criticism of the War and W wouldn't go over with the NASCAR dads. But hey, Dennis your Agememnon references ruined Monday night football for those same NASCAR dads, and you will never go over with them.<br /><br />Will Ferrell will go over with them, even as he parodies them, they will love him, and he will slip some Steve Earle into the soundtrack, and it will sound redneck but will actually be very subversive. Will Ferrell will totally get away with all of it.<br /><br />I watched this movie at Christmas with my dad, and he loved it, and my nephew also received a copy of it for Christmas, and he liked it too. There is a very touching father/son back story, and it appeals to all ages and socio-economic backgrounds.<br /><br />I just realized that the French driver was played by the guy who made Borat. I hear he is funny in that movie, too.<br /><br />Let's all get thrown out of Applebee's!!!</p></body></html>

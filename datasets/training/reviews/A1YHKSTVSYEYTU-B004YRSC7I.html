<meta name="summary" content="INTELLIGENT AND CLEVER"></head><body><p>Guy Pearce gives an excellent performance as Leonard Shelby, a man trying to find the people who brutally raped and murdered his wife and left him unable to make new memories, in this complex thriller told backwards by writer-director Christopher Nolan.<p>Because of his condition Leonard has to continually keep notes, on paper, with polaroids but also with tattoos and notes written on his body, as his only ways of retaining any new information. From day to day he has to rely on his notes to remind him of his progress and trust that they are correct. His life is permanently lived in present-tense and his only purpose is to find those responsible for his wife's murder.<p>What makes this movie really intriguing and keeps you on the edge of your seat is the fact that the story is told from the end backwards, each segment of the movie revealing a little bit more of what has previously happened. Who is a friend who is an enemy? This is what keeps you interested, this what keeps you guessing. I saw this movie at the theatre and what made it a great movie first time, apart from the excellent story and excellent acting from all concerned, is the surprise element and whilst if you are watching this movie for the first time it really is a rewarding experience, my concern with buying it on DVD, is that like many great thrillers it's maybe not so good for repeated viewings. Despite the fact that it is undoubtedly excellently crafted and has top notch performances from Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Anne Moss, it's the intrigue that holds the movie together and hold it together it does very well, for this is an excellent, very intelligent movie. I just feel that once you know the end of the movie (the beginning of the story) it might not hold the same allure (or your attention) second or third time around. If you haven't seen it though and you like slow-burn, complex, intelligent thrillers, this comes highly recommended and will hopefully bring Guy Pearce an Oscar nomination. If you are looking for something upbeat or fast paced this wont be for you...</p></body></html>

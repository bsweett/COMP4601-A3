<meta name="summary" content="A totally amazing adventure!"></head><body><p>'Little Miss Sunshine' is an extremely well made film and its just like witnessing a family living right next door to you, and you are even more surprised when you find out how down to earth the charecters in the family are and are so genuine that you may even compare some of them with your close neighbors or people you may or maynot know. Abigail Breslin simply steals the show, she is beyond words! and an extremely flamboyant performence by Steve Carell, Toni Collette and the rest other cast. The film will surely entertain you, carry you along with its emotion. Witness every inch of this unforgettable adventure of a family, you wont be dissapointed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bad, BAD movie!"></head><body><p>I didn't care much for the first "Bridget Jones" movie, and the second one was just plain awful.  For the life of me, I cannot figure out what is supposed to be appealing about Renee Zellweger's character.  She's not a BAD person, but she's annoying and is a social disaster, and I don't understand how these two fabulous British guys (played by Colin Firth and Hugh Grant) could possibly be interested in her.<br /><br />The plot of "The Edge of Reason" also leaves a lot to be desired.  There really wasn't anything else to tell about Bridget Jones, but since the first film made so much money, they decided to make a second movie (regardless of the fact that it was so crappy) in hopes of making even MORE money.  Sadly, the plan worked, but I wasted two hours of my life in the movie theatre that I'll never get back.<br /><br />I really tried to like this movie.  I love Firth and Grant, but they weren't enough to save the film.  (Grant is only in the movie for a grand total of about ten minutes, too, so moviegoers who haven't read the book version will likely be disappointed.)  By the time the Thai prison scenes rolled around, I was thoroughly disgusted.  How could they have made this movie more ridiculous?!  I don't think they could have.<br /><br />The only "good" thing I can say about this movie is that it supposedly sticks pretty close to the plot of the book, but that should tell you something about the quality of that particular novel.  I haven't read it, but I'm guessing that it sucks.  Don't waste your time or money on this crappy, crappy movie.</p></body></html>

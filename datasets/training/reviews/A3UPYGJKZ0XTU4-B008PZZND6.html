Annie Proulx about two men who, young and poor, meet in 1963 when they tend a herd of sheep for the summer on Wyoming's Brokeback Mountain. Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) is laconic, introverted and plans to marry shortly. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an outgoing rodeo jock, estranged from his family, who dreams of better things. Isolated and increasingly attracted by their mutual differences, the two men have a passionate affair. When the summer is over, Ennis marries his sweetheart Alma (Michelle Williams), and they start a family. Jack moves up in the world by marrying Lureen (Anne Hathaway), the rebellious daughter of a well-to-do farm equipment distributor in Texas. Ennis and Jack see one another sporadically over the next couple of decades on fishing trips where they rekindle their relationship, and Jack becomes increasingly frustrated with Ennis' resignation that their association can never be more than occasional and secretive.<br /><br />"Brokeback Mountain" is a story of cowboys, but it is not a "Western" genre film. It's an "epic love story" genre film in the sense of being a stock story of 2 people who fall in love in their youth and are kept apart by social conventions. We've all seen this plot a thousand times, but "Brokeback Mountain" fails to convince as either "epic" or "love story". Annie Proulx's short story is intimate and focused. The material isn't suitable for an epic. The film doesn't have the production values to pull it off anyway. The 1.85:1 format doesn't flatter the Wyoming landscapes, and attempts at grand vistas undermine the core tension in the plot. As to the love story, I don't see it. There is no chemistry between Ennis and Jack and no evidence of undying love. Ennis and Jack seem like buddies who get the hots for one another now and again. Their fishing trips come across simply as nostalgia for a time when they were young and happy, not stolen moments of desperate love. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, the short story gives the same impression. But it's clearly not what the film's screenwriters or director intended.<br /><br />The filmmakers intended a love story with a message (so they've said). For that, the actors needed help from the editor and cinematographer. The short story has no such agenda. Annie Proulx's story succeeds precisely because it focuses on the intimate relationship between these 2 men to the exclusion of everything else. The film shows us a lot of open spaces and wide angles. Poorly chosen lenses and landscapes make it difficult, if not impossible, for Jack and Ennis' alleged frustration and desperation to come through. Poorly chosen cuts and excessive length dilute the main storyline. Forty-five minutes should and could easily have been cut from the film to focus its emotions. Screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana intended to "flesh out" Annie Proulx's story. But instead they stretched it out and watered it down with extraneous material. Alma, who is a credible, embittered character in the short story, has been made weak and weepy. Her acrimony is transferred to Lureen. Ennis comes across simply as someone who can't decide what he wants, and Jack as someone who always wants things that are out of reach. The trouble is that the movie is about two men deeply in love. Supposedly. "Brokeback Mountain" is excessively long, unfocused, and unconvincing.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2006): There are 4 featurettes. "On Being a Cowboy" (6 min) includes interviews with the cast, director Ang Lee, stunt coordinator, and animal wranglers on how the actors learned to ride and rope. "Directing from the Heart: Ang Lee" (8 min) includes interviews with the cast, producers, and cinematographer in which they speak about Ang Lee. Lee himself talks about the film's dramatic themes. In "From Script to Screen: Interviews with Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana" (11 min), the screenwriters talk about adapting Annie Proulx's story, which takes up only half of the screenplay. No kidding. (A bit of sarcasm there.) "Sharing the Story: The Making of Brokeback Mountain" (20 min) is a "Logo Movie Special" documentary made for television about making the film, from preparing the actors to filming in Canada, to audience reactions. Captions are available for the film in English, subtitles in Spanish and French, dubbing in French.</p></body></html>

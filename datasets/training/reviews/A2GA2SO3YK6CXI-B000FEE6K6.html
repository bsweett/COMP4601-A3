<meta name="summary" content="Nicolas Cage at his best"></head><body><p>This movie surfaces the subject of illegal arms dealing. Yuri Orlov, played brilliantly by Nicolas Cage, finds his one true talent and with the assistance of his brother he sets out to purchase and sell weapons of all sorts.<br /><br />From the depth of Ukraine immigrant status, Yuri Orlov reaches the top of his trade, supplying weapons to anyone and everyone interested in making a deal.<br /><br />The movie is simply amazing. The cynicism of the dialogue leaves us pondering on, as Mr. Orlov says, the fact that a decent, honest job is done by too many people, with very thin margins, and yet, there are large fortunes to be made selling every kind of weapons he can get his amoral hands on.<br /><br />Since childhood, Mr. Orlov has been in love with a beautiful model and wherever he travels, as he sees the tabloids displaying her image, he focuses in someday possessing this "trophy wife" played by Bridget Moynahan.<br /><br />At first, she is unaware of what he does for a living, and he convinces her that he is a millionaire in his own right, even though he has rented the plane he uses to take her away from a hotel where he had lured her under the disguise of photo opportunity.<br /><br />Orlov's brother, played by Jared Leto, helps him to achieve his goals, but he is disturbed about the consequences of the trade they are in. As he sees countless victims die under the fire of the very weapons they sell, he finds refuge in his cocaine drug addiction, to mask the fact that he is an accomplice.<br /><br />Yuri's cynicism is brilliantly played by Nicholas Cage, as he traffics in the death of thousands, the way other salesman might push vitamins or something good for humanity.<br /><br />Some of the very cynical statements are left for the audience to ponder on the fact that "automobiles, alcohol and tobacco kill more people than weapons of all sorts."<br /><br />Yuri Orlov travels all over the world, visiting a ruthless Liberian dictator, played by Eamonn Walker, who acquires weapons to eliminate any citizen who opposes his oppressive regime. The son is riveted in obtaining Rambo's weapon and even this, Yuri Orlov is able to acquire for him.<br /><br />In the end... when Yuri is put in jail, as he discusses his life with the man who has been after him throughout the film, he says... "My parents disowned me, my wife and child have left me... members of my family are dead... yes... I understand my situation." The reply is priceless... for the persecutor says... "I would send you to hell, but you already live there!"<br /><br />While incredible dark humor is at play with this movie, I would highly recommend this film, for it surfaces the dangers of the arms race, and the high price we pay as nations continue to build arsenals of destruction.</p></body></html>

There's not a moment of entertainment to be found in any of its self-indulgent 150 minutes ... unless, of course, you find mindless action sequences and inconsequential plots entertaining. It follows the tradition of its equally God-awful predecessor by bombarding us with tangled images of destruction before pausing to be funny, although I use the term loosely since I never laughed, although I did smirk once at an outburst from one of the Transformer robots. I won't spoil it for you, seeing as there would no other reason to go see this film once you know what it is.<br /><br />The plot: Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is ready to go to college. Before he leaves, he discovers a broken piece of the cube from the first film, the one that can turn any inanimate object into a Transformer. Instantly, his mind is filled with bizarre symbols that somehow relate to the ongoing war between the Autobots and the Decepticons. Once he's in school, he occasionally has severe mental overloads, causing him to talk incoherently and write out all the symbols in his head. With the help of his techno-geek roommate, Leo Spitz (Ramon Rodriguez), and his girlfriend, Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), Sam tracks down the flustered Agent Simmons (John Turturro), who now works behind the counter of his mother's deli. Simmons has reason to believe that the Transformers have been among us for thousands of years.<br /><br />The Autobots, meanwhile, have since allied themselves with Earth armies to track down and destroy any Decepticons that have been in hiding. But it's a very shaky alliance, especially now that Decepticons are arriving from outer space and destroying major cities all over the world. A highly distrustful government official named Galloway (John Benjamin Hickey) seems to believe that they're only after the Autobots, not only because the remaining shard of the cube is under heavy lock and key, but also because the evil Megatron is slowly decaying at the bottom of the ocean. The leader of the Autobots, Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen), knows that Galloway is wrong and turns to Sam for help.<br /><br />Up in space, there awaits the malevolent Decepticon known only as The Fallen (voiced by Tony Todd), who, as the title suggests, wants revenge against Earth and the Autobots. Why? Who cares? Let's just leave it at this: If he didn't want revenge, there wouldn't be a movie.<br /><br />Back to Sam and his pals. They end up in the Egyptian desert for one reason or another and make a remarkable discovery in one of the three Pyramids. This, in turn, leads to the climactic battle between the Decepticons, Optimus Prime, and the American military. Funny how the Egyptian military (or any random Egyptian, for that matter) fails to notice that the Pyramids are being blown and smashed to smithereens. No matter; we're only supposed to pay attention to the action, and boy, is there a lot of it. I will say that I kind of liked the Transformer that used its mouth as a gigantic vacuum cleaner, sucking up sand as if it lived off of the stuff. Naturally, its throat is nothing more than a series of metal gears meant to grind whatever it sucks up into fine fragments.<br /><br />But wait--I haven't even gotten to the "funny" parts yet. In the course of this movie, we see a mini Transformer ravishing Mikaela's leg like a dog, Sam's beloved Bumblebee Camero SS crying at the thought of being abandoned, and Sam's mother (Julie White) accidentally eating a marijuana-laced brownie, after which she acts like a reject from a vaudeville slapstick routine. As if this weren't bad enough, two Transformers in particular cross the fine line between satire and insensitivity; disguised as a pair of compact hatchbacks, twins Skids and Mudflap (voiced by Tom Kenny and Reno Wilson) constantly argue with each other using slang-heavy ghetto street talk. The filmmakers take the stereotype one step further by giving one of them a gold tooth. This isn't funny. It's not even mildly amusing. It wouldn't be appropriate in any movie, let alone the sequel to "Transformers."<br /><br />I enjoy escapist entertainment as much as the next person. But my God, something went horribly wrong when Michael Bay decided to make two films based on action figures. "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" is such a miserable experience, so loud, so visually unappealing, so terrible at finding a balance between action and humor. The story is jam-packed, but not with anything of interest or value. Absolutely nothing about the plot sinks in; it's a two and a half-hour exercise in storytelling without actually telling a story. The next time I want that kind of experience, I'll read a book with the TV on while playing a CD of exploding sound effects on my stereo system. I'll make sure to turn the subwoofer all the way up, because goodness knows feeling the sounds is just as important as hearing them.</p></body></html>

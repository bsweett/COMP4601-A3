<meta name="summary" content="From a Grown-Up Muggle's Perspective"></head><body><p>I haven't read any of the books so far--although a book discussion group (adult level) I sponsor in my library has opted to make the first book in the seriew their April selection.  I caught the first movie in the series several months after its release, and although I was in any hurry to see it (or to see it again for that matter), I did find it enjoyable and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to most viewers.  Ditto this second entry. As far as family fare goes, in fact, the series is turning out to be just that--something the entire family might enjoy on various levels. These are films that parents (or other caregivers) can actually discuss with kids at some length, and parents, older siblings and other older Muggles are likely to get hooked enough to pick up the books as well. (OK, OK, as I said, I haven't as of yet, but I work in a library, so I know it happens!)<p>THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS has even better special effects than the first film, and the child actors seem more comfortable in their roles. And the distinguished adult cast members are all fine, and look as though they're having a ball. As others have noted, the film may be a little too dark for the very youngest viewers. It's also a bit on the long side, so younger children are likely to get antsy and older viewers, like me, may find themselves getting a little sleepy.  But it wraps up well. If I may be alowed one cynical observation it would be that, in the future, fantasy writers and screenwriters might want to ease up on the cutesy humanoid figures who refer to themselves --and others-- in the third person all the time.</p></body></html>

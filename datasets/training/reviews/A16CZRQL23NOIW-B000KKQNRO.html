<meta name="summary" content="A terrible disappointment!"></head><body><p>Here we have!. An intriguing and hyper interesting novel converted by the greedy concessions of the market in another cheap thriller where many important details are simply ignored in order to convey and worst still to disorient the great audiences about the relevant dramatic core.<br /><br />Audrey Tatoo did not get the expected chemistry with Tom Hanks and worst still with  the director. Her personage looks extremely flat; she is much better actress than you think in case this is the first time you have watched her on screen.  The only actors who really shone in this stranded mess were Ian Mac Kellen and Jurgen Prochnow.<br /><br />I try to fit the hat of all viewers that did not read the book, and frankly I understand them. There are many holes in the script, that you necessarily must complete reading the book.<br /><br />I really would like to remark ten fundamental inconsistencies I the script; the first one: How did Langdon get to obtain the secret code to open the criptex at the end? (It is too artificial and you may observe it in the book); second, how could the screenwriter to forget the invaluable information about the integrants of Zion's Priorate? it's really unforgiving, third, the sequences in the Ritual I which Sophie saw his grandfather are not enough explained, and that causes a profound distortion on the whole understanding process; four the crucial message around the Virgin of the rocks is simply ignored; five the presence of the watchman at the moment they enter at the temple searching for the graves? ; six: it is not well explained the distorted and brutalizing existence and late conversion of Silas, seven: the final ending in the book suggest us a probably reencounter of Langdon and Sophie, eight: the rivalry between both police officers is not carved in relief; nine there two criptex nor just one; ten what about the enromous significance about the letter V?.<br /><br />In order to adjust certain characters I would have suggested those actors:  Sean Penn,  Tim Roth, Jude Law, Daniel Day Lewis, Robert Downey Jr. or Joseph Fiennes  in the role of Tom Hanks who looked overacted and out of context respect the character of Robert Langdon;  Audrey Tatoo is OK,  and Daniel Auteil as Fache, Gary Oldman or Edward Norton as Silas; Chris Cooper, Tom Wilkinson, Harvey Keitel or Aidan Quinn  as Aringarosa, with a director of more penetrating vision ; four directors come to my mind: Jean Jacques Anaud, Oliver Hirshbiegel, Sam Mendes or Jonathan Demme.</p></body></html>

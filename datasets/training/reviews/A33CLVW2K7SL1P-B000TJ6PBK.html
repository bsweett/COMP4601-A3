I rarely like any of the movies made from his books (Misery is an exception), and have only truly been satisfied from his shorter works, of which The Shawshank Redemption and Stand By Me are perfect examples.<br /><br />1408 - hasn't it's premise been done to death? A strange hotel with a stranger general manager, a haunted room, mysterious ghosts and figures appearing and disappearing, rarely in a pattern that makes sense? Yeah, it has. And all of the good acting and top-notch special effects end up being nothing more than cheap window dressing, and window dressing has never saved a film.<br /><br />It's probably true that there are no more original stories to be told, but I need a more distinctive stamp of novelty before I'll buy into listening to, reading, or watching another take an age old concept.<br /><br />The ending was supposed to be shocking. Really? It was as predictable as an ending can be. Although I should admit that I kept expecting aliens to pop out of nowhere and take credit for the haunting. But he's done that, already, in how many movies?<br /><br />I have to admit that I feel strange criticizing the work of a man who has written more books than I could contemplate writing, but in his book On Writing, King said that he essentially follows tangents and lets them lead him through his work. It's a formula that has sold tens, if not hundreds of millions of books for him, but not a formula that any student of writing should consider. To blindly follow a tangent without stopping to ask yourself questions like "Does this make sense?" can only lead to ruin.</p></body></html>

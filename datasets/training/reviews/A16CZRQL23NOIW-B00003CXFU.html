But few times, we had had the opportunity to watch with such boldness the ferociousness, constancy and dedication like this one.<br /><br />We should be back to the times if Silkwood or The China syndrome to feel with such powerful intensity the importance about the magnitude of the ethical limits of the industrialization and the preservation of the environmental health; that degenerated in an unpredictable scandal of majuscule proportions<br /><br />On the other hand of the coin, (and I must confess I have never been a special fan of Mrs. Roberts) she displayed by far,  the best of her repertoire and gave us a very real portrait that deserved her the Academy Award that year.<br /><br />One more thing: in order to the fairness, I would personally would have stated decreed an equal number of votes with another superb and perhaps never equaled performance: Ellen Burstyn and "Requiem for a dream". And that I keep this statement taking into account that famous double prize between Barbara Streisand and Vanessa Redgrave in 1967, where the difference in what acting concerns was even major.<br /><br />Excellent edition and magisterial direction of Steven Soderbergh.</p></body></html>

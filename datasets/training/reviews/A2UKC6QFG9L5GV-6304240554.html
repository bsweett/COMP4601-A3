So it's obvious that you'd like to buy this one. And I won't tell about film itself - just a couple of words about this edition. I'd call it "All You Ever Wanted To Know About 'Dawn...'". Because here you have everything you could possibly desire. Commentaries, documentaries, galleries, trailers etc. EVERYTHING on 4 discs. The edition has three versions of the film - U.S. theatrical, extended and European. Extended is rather longer and has some bonus scenes but U.S. theatrical is what was prefered by George Romero himself so it's the one what this film was supposed to be from the very beginning. The European one was edited by Dario Argento and is slightly shorter than the others but it's not because Argento just shortened it - he cut out some footage but he inserted some more - some gory stuff. So it's not like this version is cut, don't be confused, it has some footage not available in other versions so it's interesting to watch anyway. They say there is some German version which is the extended plus Argento's footage but it was not possible to edit all this in potable way so this version is a total mess and is not necessary to watch. Anyway you have all that's needed here.<br />I don't think there will ever be some edition to top this one so buy it without any doubts. It is definately worth the money.</p></body></html>

Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a retired CIA special ops man who has recently moved so that he can be closer to his teenage daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) who is living with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and her wealthy stepfather (Xander Berkeley).  Bryan loves his daughter deeply, but feels disconnected from her and because of the posh lifestyle she is currently living. He is concerned that she might be loosing her way.  When Kim is presented with an opportunity to travel with a friend to Paris for the summer, Bryan is against the idea.  His work with the CIA have taught him how dangerous it is for young women to be traveling alone across Europe. Besides that, Kim is underage and her protective mother and stepfather have been overprotective and sheltered her from any knowledge of the real dangers of the world.  However, after being reassured of Kim and her traveling companion, Amanda's (Katie Cassidy), supervision by a family in Paris, that there would not be any globe-trotting alone, and Kim's promise that she would call her father every day, he consents to let her go.  It is only later that he learns the girls aren't going for any sort of educational reason, but to be a band groupie following a particular group on their European tour.  Bryan is furious, but is still trying to reconnect and against his better judgment allows her to go.<br /><br />Upon arriving in Paris, Amanda & Kim are met by a handsome, young Frenchmen who invites them to a party later that night and rides with them to the place where they will be staying.  Kim is a bit unsettled by the many, but Amanda is smitten with lust. Upon arriving at the residence Kim is shocked to discover that Amanda wasn't being completely honest with her either because the family they are to stay with are gone for most of the summer and the girls will be left on their own.  Shortly after, while talking to her father on the phone, Kim watches Amanda being abducted and sees the men coming for her.  It turns out the man at the airport was the frontman for a group of individuals who make a fortune from kidnapping young foreign women, addicting them to drugs, and then selling them as sex slaves.  Bryan tells Kim what to do and she obeys his every command right up until the point she is taken herself.  Knowing that he has right around 48 hours to find his daughter before she is lost from him forever, Bryan begins calling in some favors and takes a personal jet of his wife's husband to Paris and begins looking for his daughter and hunting down the criminals who have taken her.<br /><br />TAKEN is an action-packed movie that doesn't really stop once it starts.  The first 15 minutes or so of the film are expositional in nature to introduce the audience to the characters, but from the moment that the kidnappers break into the Paris home until almost the very end of the picture, the movie is non-stop action.  Liam Neeson is a wonderful actor and I have yet to see him give a bad performance.<br /><br />Besides just being a good action movie, TAKEN also examines some subject matter that most Americans are unaware but should become more familiar.  There are some coincidences in the movie used for dramatic purposes, but the portrayal of how the women in the movie are abused and victimized isn't just startling, but is also quite accurate.  The kidnapping and selling of women as sex slaves is something that does happen and in some parts of the world has almost become common.<br /><br />Overall, I found TAKEN to be a very good movie. There are certain parts of the plot that are predictable, but the movie is action packed and makes for an afternoon or evening of enjoyable viewing.  It's also a movie that any parent with a daughter should watch.<br /><br />The two-disc version of the movie includes both cuts of the movie (PG-13 & Unrated versisons), two commentary tracks, a making of featurette "Le Making Of", a video of the movie's premier entitled "Avant Premiere", a featurette that illustrates how some of the action scenes were made, and some trailers.</p></body></html>

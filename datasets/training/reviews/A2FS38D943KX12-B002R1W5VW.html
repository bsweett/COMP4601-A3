<meta name="summary" content="It's nice to see that Nicolas Cage & Ridley Scott can still make a good film"></head><body><p>"Matchstick Men" may not have been a box office success (compare it to the total gross of "National Treasure" [Cage's next film] and "Kingdom of Heaven" [Scott's next film]), but it certainly is one of the better-crafted & better-acted films to be associated with either of these men.  I was beginning to wonder if Cage could ever repeat a performance like what he did in "Leaving Las Vegas."  While his obsessive-compulsive con-man may not be the disaster along the lines of a suicidal alcoholic, he comes close with the impact he makes on the viewer.  This could easily have veered into caricature, but Cage creates a creditable & believable obsessive-compulsive.<br /><br />Perhaps this could be classified as a comedy, but it has an awfully bittersweet quality to it which makes the movie difficult to categorize with any ease.  The characters of Roy & Angela (a very very good performance by Alison Lohman, who is entirely believable as a 14-year-old) are real enough to cause the viewer to have a vested interest in their ultimate fate, as the movie takes numerous twists & turns.<br /><br />Ridley Scott did quite a good job at crafting a movie that avoids being too obvious, and which flows along nicely, maintaining viewer interest throughout.  This was a very satisfying film, through & through...I wish these two guys could make more like this.</p></body></html>

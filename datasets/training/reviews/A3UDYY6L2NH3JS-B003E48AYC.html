<meta name="summary" content="Enchanting magic"></head><body><p>A beautiful film indeed. Beautiful because of the images themselves. Systematically light, colorful, very dynamic, surprising in all kinds of way, frightening a few times but most of the time enchanting and magic. Beautiful because of the actors who play so well and are so well adapted to their roles. Of course the Mad Hatter is the best in that line, even in a way better than Alice who is more standard, more exactly the way we imagine her. The queens are fine too but the White Queen does not have the charisma she should have to be able to inspire a struggle and revolution of the type she leads. The Red Queen is just hateful and odious. She is perfect in her role there but she has no charm and no appeal. She is repellent from the very start. Then you have the animals that are so lovable, even the big monstrosity that flies and is supposed to be some kind of distorted and out of shape dragon. Of course this one is most lovable when his head is down on the ground. Beautiful too because of the simple story, though it is deeply political. A good queen, fights for the crown that has been confiscated by a bad queen. It is the story of a liberation, though it is very simple, nearly na?ve and the transporting of the crown from one head to the other at the end by the invisible cat is kind of too simple to be true. But of course it is a tale and it is clear that freedom is not possible without a fight, though the fight is reduced to very few people, heroes in a way, not real people fighting together to bring the future to life. The original story is of course responsible for this naivet&eacute; of the fight between two sisters, a good one and a bad one. But all is well that ends well, and it ends well. Alice will not marry her promised Lord and will become a navigator, for commerce of course and with China mind you. We will forget that at the time the story was written the English managed to manipulate China into opium wars and some other horrors of the type. Let's just consider that today opium does not come from China and China is our future.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A crime classic!"></head><body><p>Al Pacino plays as Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant whom arrives in Miami Flordia to become the cocaine king of the city and the most successful one at that. However, it becomes a living hell when he fights against the other mobs of the city, his sister having affairs with other men and his relationship with a beautiful woman named Elviria ( Michelle Pfeifer) is mixed when he's going out killing for Coke ( the drug, not the drink).<br /><br />This happens to be Al Pacino's signature role! this 1983 crime drama is a definite epic of the genre, it was trashed by some critics but made a decent box-office success and a huge cult following even among today's hip-hop stars. This is a brutal, gory and entertaining 3-hour tour-de force from director Brian De Palma that is definitely not for everybody but it's a must see movie and one of my top 109 favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />The new 2-Disc anniversary Edition DVD has awesome picture & great sound quality. It has a second disc which contains very good extras like featurettes on how the movie got from remaking a classic 1932 gangster flick, the casting, the controverseries on getting the movie a "R" rating instead of an "X" rating and how it became a cult classic, it also has a interesting documentary on how this movie inspired the lives of the popular rap artists in the music industry and a funny montage of how the theatrical release compares with the censored TV version.<br /><br />This movie is strongly recommended, definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience.<br /><br />Also recommended: " Leon The Professional", " Kill Bill series", " Pulp Fiction", "L.A. Confidential", "Gangs of New York", " Reservoir Dogs", " The Godfather trilogy", " Goodfellas", " Assault on Precinct 13" ( original and remake), and " Se7en".</p></body></html>

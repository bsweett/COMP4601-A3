<meta name="summary" content="Brutal (If Predictable) Storyline Leads To Great Character Growth"></head><body><p>After nearly 20 Rambo-less years (1988-2007), I was a bit skeptical about what to expect from this film.  Sylvester Stallone seemed a bit old to be playing the lead role, and the character had been "on the shelf" for so long that his viability in American culture was very much in doubt.  Fortunately, though the writers/producers didn't get everything right, they pleasantly surprised me by providing a film that is quite enjoyable and worthy of the Rambo title.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, this film explores a much darker side of the John Rambo (Stallone) character.  Found in the deepest regions of Indo-China, an emotionally lost and severely conflicted Rambo reluctantly agrees safe passage to a group of missionaries bringing supplies to the war-ravaged region of Burma.  When the peace mission goes awry and the mercenaries are called in, Rambo feels compelled to once again enter the war zone he has tried for so long to avoid.<br /><br />Really, the only glaring problem with this film is that the plot is very predictable.  You know that things will get screwed up somehow and that Rambo will be called in to fix the situation, so some of the Burmese-territory exposition is a little tedious.  If you can get past this, though, it truly is an entertaining film.<br /><br />The aspect that stands out the most is the brutalness of the entire picture.  What the film loses in predictability it makes up for with some brutal scenes that will really make you despise the Burmese war force.  The slaughter of women, children, animals, and the complete burning of villages are shown with no detail spared.  Plus, it isn't as if the brutality is just being played for bloody special effects, either.  Stallone did his research this time and tried to replicate the shock value of civil warfare/genocide, and the result are some very shocking scenes.<br /><br />What really sets this movie apart, though, is its focus on the John Rambo character.  Whereas parts II & III of the series were just shoot-em-ups, this installment actually tries (like the original) to delve into what makes Rambo tick.  In fact, a lot more time (the film is only 91 minutes long) could have been devoted to the inner-workings of the Vietnam Vet and it wouldn't have been boring.<br /><br />Thus, if you are at all skeptical about coming back to the Rambo franchise after such a long layoff, please dispel those notions and see this movie.  It is easily the best effort in the franchise since the original First Blood.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good In Its Own Right. 59 out of 100."></head><body><p>So many reviews of re-makes rip the film apart because it was not the original. The new Amityville Horrow is not the original, but it is a darn good film in its own right.<br /><br />I found the film sexy, scary, well-acted, and very entertaining. Ryan Reynolds as George Lutz, and Melissa George as Kathy Lutz, put in very believable performances. Their surrounding cast of children add to the film's immersion and intangibles as well.<br /><br />I know I have seen the first Amityville Horror, and to be honest I don't recall much other than a lot of flies (I am nearly 40, and was 12 when it came out), but I can't imagine how it could be much better than the remake. Don't get me wrong, I am sure it is a great film, but this version is pretty darn good for a horror film.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it because of the critics who say "It isn't the original", you're missing out.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 59<br /><br />31 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />9 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br />5 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br />8 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br />5 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br />1 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?</p></body></html>

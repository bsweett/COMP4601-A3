That bites"></head><body><p>"Jaws," which debuted on DVD five years ago in a silver anniversary edition, circles back with a 30th-year effort that chums the marketplace with upgraded extras and packaging. There are no noticeable improvements in audio or video quality.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg, as usual, provides no commentary. But the director has plenty to say in Laurent Bouzereau's fine documentary "The Making of Jaws," created for the 1995 laserdisc. In 2000, Universal gutted the 125-minute docu to under an hour, so it remains basically unseen. The film launched Bouzereau's triple-threat career as a making-of specialist, now with more than 130 titles to his credit.<br /><br />The hard-luck shoot's history gets a full review, including the myriad problems with mechanical sharks. Spielberg recalls "Jaws" as a "fun movie to watch, but not a fun movie to make."<br /><br />Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Scheider vie for camera time, spinning terrific stories. For the record: Scheider insists he never referred to the great white as Bruce, and never will. (Spielberg named the killing machine after his lawyer.)<br /><br />New to DVD is "From the Set," a 9-minute British TV piece hailing from 1974. The 26-year-old Spielberg, hot off "The Sugarland Express," is interviewed in the waters off Martha's Vineyard. He looks like a pop star but talks like a savvy pro. ("Young, courageous and stupid," he later calls himself.) The high concept was "Duel" at sea.<br /><br />The anamorphic widescreen video (2.35:1) comes ported over from the older DVD, not really a bad thing. Images are reasonably bright and enjoyable, but typical of the era they're soft and grainy. Minor speckling surfaces throughout, a defect that will have to wait for the 35th year, apparently.<br /><br />Universal released two "Jaws" DVDs in 2000, one with Dolby Digital 5.1 and the other with DTS. The new DVD features both formats as well as mono for old salts yearning for the bad old days of 1970s movie audio. The surround tracks sound great, especially John Williams' thumping shark theme, its menace amplified by watery-grave lows from the subwoofer. Go with DTS if you have it.</p></body></html>

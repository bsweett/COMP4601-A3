<meta name="summary" content="Ben-Him"></head><body><p>First released in 1959, "Ben Hur" is one the grandest, if not the most courageous exploration of sublimated hoe-more-sect-chew-all love between men. <p>The film takes place in Judea during Jesus Christ's lifetime. It begins when boyhood friends, Messala (Stephen Boyd) and Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) are reunited in Jerusalem as young men. Messala is now a Tribune in command of the Roman legions that occupy Judea and Judah is both a prince and a wealthy merchant who objects to the Roman occupation in principle but does not overtly oppose it. Under the pretext of discharging his duty as a Roman soldier, Messala urges Judah to inform on any friends or acquaintances that refuse to accept Roman rule. When Judah refuses to comply with this request, Messala turns it into a demand stating that Judah is either for him or against him.<p>In reality, Messala is sublimating his repressed sect-chew-all desire for Judah and expressing it in consciously acceptable terms. Messala and Judah spent their boyhood together until the age of fourteen when Messala was sent to Rome. Undoubtedly the separation was difficult for both boys but for obvious reasons it traumatized Messala much more. In the first place, Messala was separated from Judah during the advent of his sect-chew-all maturity and before he could resolve any burgeoning sect-chew-all feelings for him. But at the same time, Messala was also transposed from an environment in which he enjoyed relative physical and personal freedom (He and Judah hunted together, and men in Judea are cool about crying when they are upset.) to one in which he underwent rigorous, depersonalizing indoctrination as both a Roman citizen and as a military officer. <p>Few things could have produced a more disastrous result since Messala now not only repressed his feelings for Judah, but also lacked adequate emotional tools in which to resolve them. As a result, instead of returning to the lost paradise of youth (One he references when he asks Judah if he still hunts jackals and wolves.) Messala attempts to indoctrinate Judah in the same way that he was. On the surface Messala is commanding Judah, but on an emotional level he is actually pleading with him, essentially saying "Look, I can't go back to what we were so let's love each other by having you become what I am." If Judah could properly identify the emotional process at work then he could possibly avert disaster. For example, he could say, "Forget about all this governing Judea stuff, let's talk about you and me." But because Judah fails to recognize the emotional process at work, he inadvertently rejects Messala's emotional advances with catastrophic results. Messala's identity is now trapped in an in-between state since he cannot return to his youthful past and Judah will not join him in his adult present. As a result, in order to prevent his own psychic annihilation, Messala must now destroy Judah-not so much because he rejected him but because his continued presence reminds him of what he has lost forever. For this reason, Messala has Judah condemned as a galley slave and imprisons his mother and sister in the local dungeon where all three face certain death.<p>After three years in the galleys, Judah is partially freed by a Roman Consul who identifies him with his own dead son. Judah subsequently saves the Consul's life and as a result, the Consul adopts him and trains him to race horses in the Roman circus. <p>The Consul's relationship with Judah is partly paternalistic and partly sect-chew-all-iced. In liberating Judah and training him to ride in the circus, the Consul unconsciously provides him with the sect-chew-all mentoring he requires to resolve his conflict with Messala. After all, in order to race in the Roman games, Judah must think and behave as a Roman, which means that he has now become indoctrinated in the same manner as Messala. This is apparent when Judah returns to Judea and confronts Messala, who can barely conceal his pleasure toward the fact that Judah has come back not as a Jewish prince or galley slave, but as a Roman aristocrat. <p>The sect-chew-all conflict between the two men is ultimately resolved during the film's climactic chariot race whose sect-chew-all symbolism is all too apparent.  The chariot race takes place in a public arena in which men dressed in scanty, flashy costumes drive powerful horses from chariots mounted behind them. <p>At first Messala dominates this conflict in several manners. Messala has won this race during all the years of Judah's imprisonment and exile, which means that in a sense he has publicly declared his hoe-more-sect-chew-alit-E. Judah is popular as a hometown boy, but his racing skills (in other words, his sect-chew-all prowess) are unknown here although, ironically, they are well known in Rome. Messala acknowledges this during the start of the race when he smiles at Judah and says, "Hail Jupiter, grant me victory today." In doing this, Messala references the fact that they are now competing together in a Roman environment. In this sense, they have fulfilled Messala's original wish that, having lost their childhood bond, they at least become the same type of man. In referencing Jupiter, Messala subtly reminds Judah that the chariot race is a pagan conflict that recreates their lost youth. Messala is saying to Judah, "Good, you're finally here, let's play."<p>As the race progresses, Messala realizes that he cannot defeat Judah and begins to whip him furiously, which is essentially an open expression of his sect-chew-all feelings toward Judah. At first Judah is indignant, but then he seizes the whip and lashes back at Messala for the first time acknowledging his own sect-chew-all feelings toward him. This sect-chew-all expression literally overpowers Messala who is mortally injured. Shortly before his demise, however, Messala attempts to destroy Judah's hope of finding his imprisoned mother and sister (and thus of returning to their pre-sect-chew-all past). In the throes of death, Messala declares to Judah that "the race" (their sect-chew-all dance) "goes on."</p></body></html>

Brad & Angelina are two high-priced contract killers - practically superheroes.  The biggest and baddest in the business, neither has any idea of the other's true identity.  It was only a matter of time before they crossed paths, but even odds that they would do so under circumstances that allowed each to stay secret from the other.  The joke is that neither of the two has a real life besides meting exotic forms of execution, so it's no surprise that their marriage is as sexless as the movie.  Eventually, they learn the truth, and become each other's highest-priced targets.  After they've destroyed just about everything else of their lives but each other, they realize that their own bosses aren't happy about their pairing, and will eagerly finish the two of them off if they can't oblige themselves.  Thus, we've got some car chase, lots of gunplay, and too many sub-machinegun-men-in-black to count.<br /><br />In varied parts, you can see that the producers of "Smith" intended to make a romantic comedy thriller - or parts of such movies rolled up into one.  Unfortunately, "Smith" fails at each juncture.  The action is canned - lots of obvious stunts that the script telegraphs or sometimes fails to telegraph at all.  (There's a raid on a courthouse in which it's virtually impossible to follow the action.)  Also, the screenplay has neglected to supply a convenient villain - the "Hans Gruber" that puts the human face on all those black-clad & sub machinegun-armed toadies.  All that inaction wouldn't hurt the story that much as the backdrop to a romantic comedy about the Smiths, but the leads have absolutely no chemistry - in fact, most of the time, it's hard to tell what they're even saying. They don't so much as speak their lines, but deliver them - which we can probably blame on a script that's already obviously in need of the leads' star-power.  In fact, "Smith" is so dependent on who's starring in it, that the whole thing begins to look like one of those movies that indie-moviemakers have been warning us about for years, the overpriced, over-cast, overproduced pure-Hollywood production about nothing.</p></body></html>

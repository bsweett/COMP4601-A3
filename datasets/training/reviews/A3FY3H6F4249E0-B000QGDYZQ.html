<meta name="summary" content="What emotions would you experience if you had one?"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed this movie, and I like Sandra Bullock's movies anyway. This movie was about a woman who has dreams about her husband's (upcoming?)death. The dreams are in between dreams and reality. It's like she is flipping around between 2 dimentions. In one, he's dead. In another, he's alive. They are somewhat chronological. Each "dream" seems so real. Some seem to be visions of things that COULD happen, IF things progress on a certain track. As you expect, she goes through "am I nuts?" She tries to get help, but she is getting confused herself as to what is reality and others are not really able to help. Once she begins to track things on a calendar, she begins to get a handle on the situation. Then she starts to ask herself IF this is going to happen, can I stop it? Am I guilty of killing him if I don't? What the heck do I do?<br /><br />Some people may not like the way this movie seems to flip around a bit, but many people who have premonitions or visions do not have them like a movie.  They are often fragmented and full of symbolism.  This movie spared you the symbolism.  It does jump back and forth in the dream world part, but I believe it is realistic.  Sandra does a great job in portraying the emotions her character would probably have, including people's disbelief, and her own, too.<br /><br />I found it a very interesting movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. I loved the end, too.  And the movie leaves you thinking. . .</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Watch Again"></head><body><p>This is a smart, well made thriller.  A take on the 10 little Indians theme, 10 strangers find themselves at an old motel being bumped off one by one.  In the middle of this, we are shown scenes of a madman who is about to be sent to his death being defended by reason of insanity.  How does this fit in to the movie?  Well the twist ending explains it all.  What raises this movie is the all star cast of young and older stars.  Nothing was obvious, and I was left guessing through much of the movie.  It is worth watching again to see if you can pick up any clues you might have missed the first time around.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Do you believe in Heroes?"></head><body><p>Before the superhero genre became really popular with X-Men, Spiderman, Hulk and Daredevil, Unbreakable slipped onto the scene with a truly fascinating look at the possibility of Superheroes and comic books being a form of modern mythology.<br /><br />Now before you completely discount this movie for being anything like the other Superhero movies, let me reassure you that the approach on this subject is so strictly geared toward being realistic you could very much believe the premise.  The best part is that the `hero' doesn't even know he is a hero.<br /><br />In an intelligent move on his part, M. Night Shyamalan reveals almost nothing about the movie except for the phrase stated in the trailers, `There is a train wreck, there is one survivor, and he is miraculously unharmed.'  With this statement we are intrigued.  How did he survive?  Not even a scratch?  How?<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays the survivor, David Dunn, a seemingly normal individual with a bad marriage and non-communicative relationship with his son and wife.  Immediately after the wreck he is approached by a strange individual; Elijah Price, superbly played by Samuel L. Jackson.  He states his case to Dunn, revealing to him his lack of illnesses in his lifetime and the fact that subconsciously he chose a profession as a security guard.  He lays out everything with dead on seriousness and conviction.  Intrestingly, Price has a condition of brittle bones that causes them break in even the mildest of impacts.  This is what made him seek out Dunn, their stark contrasts.<br /><br />As events unfold we find out along with Dunn as he discovers he can do things he never dreamed or tried.  Shyamalan smartly tones it down in order to keep us on board.  Dunn doesn't go out and suddenly lift a car over his head.  He finds that as he works out, he can add more and more weight to the bench press.  He struggles a bit, but eventually manages to lift over 900 pounds.<br /><br />This kind of realistic discovery about himself and the enlightenment of his own abilities starts to change his own life.  He seems to find purpose, or at least importance in what who he is.  The dichotomy of his character and Elijah truly comes to a head in the finale.  This movie is slow paced thriller, with a dramatic story and a twist that is worthy of the Sixth Sense.  There is nothing in Unbreakable that would make you predict the ending of this one.  Highly recommended, a great movie.</p></body></html>

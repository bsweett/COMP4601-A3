Alas!  After reviewing the case, I must conclude the bloke was duly consumed.<br /><br />Yes, folks, this is a movie about one of the stupidest mortals to ever walk the earth in recent years.  Regardless of how you feel about Timothy Treadwell, you'll be completely dumbstruck -- enthralled -- by this movie, masterfully wrought by Werner Herzog.<br /><br />Perhaps you'd like to know:  the audio file of Timothy and Amy being eaten appears nowhere in the film, after the credits, or anywhere on this DVD in the special features.  The woman who possesses this tape (and you'll see her in the movie) hasn't released it to the public.<br /><br />I mention this because many people, I think, might buy the DVD thinking it's going to be on there somewhere.  No, the special features are crud:  no director's commentary, and a 50-minute documentary on the recording of the film's music, which is pretty much snoresville.<br /><br />There are no other special features whatsoever.<br /><br />And I love how Amazon makes it look like Amie Huguenard is "starring" in  it.  Sheesh.</p></body></html>

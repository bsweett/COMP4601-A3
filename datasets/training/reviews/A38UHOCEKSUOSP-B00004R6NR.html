<meta name="summary" content="Welcome to Jurassic Park"></head><body><p>While I loved almost every aspect of the movie, its the dinosaurs that steal the show, naturally.  And it's not just because we see a T-Rex in full form or a pair of ruthless Raptors, but this is the first time something is presented in glorious CGI.  Jurassic Park made a huge impact with that for its time, just like Terminator 2 did in 1990 and the Matrix in 1999.  Jurassic Park had its place too, at bringing to life dinosaurs that look wonderful and real, and hold up even today on the screen.<br /><br />Based off the book by Micahel Crichton, one can't expect the over all feel of the film to be as good, but honestly the whole thing worked just fine.  If you compare this original to the sequals, its even that much better.  The cast is quite decent, and though huge amounts of dialouge are not shared as well as deep in depthness to most of the characters, its ok because this is about the dinasours and the park on the island.  The first hour is spent much like one would feel taking a trip to this park, almost a vacation if you will, though already the park has its glitches.  A tropical storm comes, and combined with a sneaky worker named Dennis (Wayne Knight - that big nerdy guy in Animal House) who is just too funny sometimes, all heck breaks loose - including the dinosaurs.  Thus begins the last hour thrill ride of chases and survival tactics.  There are two scenes that are very action filled.  The first is the T-Rex attack on the two park vehicles in the rain at night.  The other was just down right scary, the pair of Velociraptors hunting the two children in the dark kitchen.<br /><br />In addition to the dinosaurs, I enjoyed the characters and their acting was fine.  The story was excellent too, and though a bit slow at first, it works out well.  Time is taken to appreciate and learn the mesmorizing truth about these creatures and how they have been recreated.  Thanks to the directing of Spielberg and the outsanding score by John Williams, every scene is a good one.  And thanks to Williams usual impressive composing skills, he creates not just good music, but a theme for Jurassic Park that is easily recognizable whenever heard.<br /><br />Though this went down as a great film, I think it deserves even more credit.  It was created before its time, and holding up very well for today's standads.  The sequals can't even compare.  The story is fascinating and the dinosaurs themselves - breathtaking, and scary.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 5<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 5</p></body></html>

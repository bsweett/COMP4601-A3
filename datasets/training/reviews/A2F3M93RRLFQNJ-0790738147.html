<meta name="summary" content="Film noir at its best"></head><body><p>L.A. Confidential is the movie that should have won Best Picture for 1998 over Titanic.  Titanic is good, but this movie is easily superior, with the intelligence and depth to be great not just once, but after repeated viewings.<p>I have watched this movie four times since it first came out and have always been totally wowed over by it.  The depiction of the dark side of 1950s Los Angeles is vivid, the characters are multidimensional, the story complex but not confusing.  <p>Despite the way this movie is marketed, the two principal actors are not Kevin Spacey and Kim Basinger, but relative newcomers Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce who have both gone on to do other great films.  (Ironically, Titanic star Leo DiCaprio - the two movies are linked to me- despite his elevated prominence after that movie, has had his career come to almost a dead halt).<p>A way to measure the difference between a good movie and a great movie is what you are thinking after watching it.  Do you think, "It was good, but it had this flaw or that flaw" or "It was good, and I especially liked how it did this or that"?  In other words, after viewing it, do you start catching flaws or catching subtleties?  L.A. Confidential fits into this latter category, a movie in which you can always find new and great things, and if you enjoy crime movies at all, this has to be on your viewing list.</p></body></html>

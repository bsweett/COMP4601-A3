There really isn't much of Tan Dun in HERO, but the sound track is extremely artful and effective as a counterpoint to the spectacular cinematography. The visual splendor of this movie is what carries the action (or lack of action) and the actors. The "story" is complex, intellectually provoking, almost a cultural essay rather than an action flick. The acting is less than subtle -- do I dare say "wooden" -- except when the computer-assisted ballets of combat erupt. The whole narrative ends in a way that many non-Chinese may find uncomfortable, if they choose to analyze it. Next time I watch, I'm gonna kill the English subtitles (if it's possible) and treat the whole thing as a symphony of sounds and colors.</p></body></html>

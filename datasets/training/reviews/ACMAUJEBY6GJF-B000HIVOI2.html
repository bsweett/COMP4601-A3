The special-effects are rather impressive, costumes and acting as well (Kurt Russell as always delievers with a certain style).<br /><br />There's an Indiana Jones-feel to "Stargate", mostly because of the fabolous music-score of course (very similar to the Indiana-score I think) -but there's also just as much adventure to the movie, perfect for a day you spend indoors because of bad weather or such.<br /><br />Recommended!</p></body></html>

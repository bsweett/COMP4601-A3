<meta name="summary" content=""Almost" hits the mark"></head><body><p>As I was born in the 1980s, I can only check out the era of blossoming rock'n'roll (Rolling Stones, the Doors, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin) through books and movies. "Almost Famous," a semi-autobiographical movie about the 1970s rock scene, gives a glimpse of the life of a young reporter (based on Crowe himself). A must-see for music fans!<p>When William's sister (Zooey Deschanel) left home, she gave him her collection of records: the Who, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, and many others. When William (Patrick Fugit) is fifteen he manages to get a writing assignment with Creem, and then with Rolling Stone magazine to write about the rising rock band Stillwater (think a mixture of the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin). William falls in with the Stillwater guys and their circle of adoring groupies, including an effervescent blonde, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).<p>Despite the displeasure of his controlling but loving mom (she claims adolescence is a marketing ploy), William accompanies Stillwater across the country. He keeps trying to get an interview with guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), but Russell is too busy partying with Penny and diving off rooftops (literally) to give William his material. But some alarming incidents show William that the drugs, sex and rock'n'roll are only a veneer for what really matters.<p>"Almost Famous" is a fantastic mixture of expose and tribute -- there's music, there's romance, there's comedy. There isn't a lot of pratfall humor, although there is some (Anna Paquin running smack into a cement wall); the scene on the airplane where everyone confesses their sins is fantastic (Ed's only line is hysterically anticlimactic). We get to see inter-band conflict (who's the star?), groupies, rock journalism, and the unfortunate aftereffects for groupies. Yet the sort-of-romance between Penny and William is very sweet, rooted in genuine affection. <p>Both the glamour and the grit is shown here. The dialogue sparkles ("Last words: I dig music... I'M ON DRUGS!", "Forgive me Father, for I may sin tonight," "I'm about to boldly go where... many men have gone before"), and the direction is superb -- it cuts forward just when it needs to; the camera follows people out onto the dizzying stage and then zooms in for intimate close-ups. Nowhere else could a stomach-pumping scene actually contain an element of romance.<p>Patrick Fugit is a surprisingly solid lead, with a sort of wide-eyed innocence that contrasts sharply with everyone else. Kate Hudson plays a sweet groupie who doesn't practice what she preaches ("Never take it seriously, you never get hurt.") and falls in love with Russell -- only to get tossed away. Her fragile "why doesn't he love me?" is one of the best lines in the movie. Billy Crudup has disarming charm and selfishness as Russell; Anna Paquin is very funny as one of Penny's groupie pals ("Don't worry, he's still a virgin"); Jason Lee is likably grumpy as Jeff Bebe, and Frances McDormand is fantastic as Fugit's weird mother.<p>Music lovers and rock aficionados will love "Almost Famous," a bittersweet coming-of-age comedy/drama/music movie. A rare treat. When and where does this "real world" occur?</p></body></html>

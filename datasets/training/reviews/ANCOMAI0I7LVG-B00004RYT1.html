Part of loving film is finding solace in the technique used to create film, and truly there is no other director who possesses the technique Hitchcock possessed.  The famed director was truly a master of his craft, able to generate genuine emotion from his audience, always using every advantage at his disposal and creating authentic and moving pictures that are still unmatched even today.  While he has delivered many masterpieces, in my humble opinion `Psycho' is his finest work.<br /><br />When you watch `Psycho' there are many techniques Hitchcock utilized to the superlative degree to deliver to his audience perfection.  First, and maybe foremost, we have the brilliant score.  Music can be a key to creating the perfect mood and tone for a film.  Think back to the ominous baritone that bubbles from the depths of `Jaws' and even recently, films like `Atonement' and `There Will Be Blood' have utilized the power of music to elevate scenes and cement themselves into our memories.  `Psycho' has probably the most memorable of all film scores for I can still hear those screeching violins every time I step into the shower.  Secondly, Hitchcock shot the film in classic black and white, even though color was an option.  Now while his initial reasoning for the decision may have been to save money, the end result leads the audience down a much more fulfilling path than had he opted for a color film.  Having seen Gus Van Sant's remake (which really isn't as horrible as critics labeled it) I can honestly say that color works against this film.  The rich grays and blacks help stir the feelings of imminent danger, helping to solidify feelings of fear even when nothing frightening is taking place on the screen.  The editing is also ferociously engrossing, especially when concerning the famous shower scene.  Hitchcock knows how to keep the audience on edge throughout the entirety of the film; thus the publicity campaign `No One Will Be Seated After the Picture Begins'.<br /><br />And then you have the plot, filled to the brim with mystery and surprise.  Hitchcock takes advantage of these plot twists in order to create a film that is genuinely shocking and unexpected (the first go around) and manages to still deliver shivers upon multiple viewings.  I have not read Robert Bloch's novel which served as inspiration for the film (I don't hear many good things about it) but Hitchcock's masterpiece shines brightly from every outlet.<br /><br />The film revolves around Marion Crane, a young woman who has a lot of things going wrong for her; most notably her affair with a married man.  Desiring to find a way to make their lives easier and enable her lover Sam to divorce his wife and marry her, Marion steals a substantial amount of money from her boss's client and flees town.  In her haste she stumbles across an old run down motel and decides to stay the night.  The manager Norman seems like a nice young man.  He's thoughtful and considerate, offering her some dinner and keeping her company.  He is a tad skittish and defensive, but nothing too alarming.  Then Marion attempts to take a shower, and we all know what happens next.<br /><br />I can't for the life of my conclude that anyone reading this review doesn't already know the brilliant twist in this film, for even those who have not seen this movie are certainly aware of it, but for the sake of that one person who genuinely has no clue I will remain silent with regards to the plot from that point onward.<br /><br />Aiding Hitchcock are the phenomenal performances by the cast, especially Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh.  There is a pivotal scene when Norman Bates and Marion Crane are eating dinner together that truly reeks with talent.  These two actors embody the souls of their characters and ooze forth with such commanding presence.  I am shocked that Anthony Perkins was denied even an Oscar nomination for his brilliant performance, creating the perfect villain who is not only fear inspiring and genuinely chilling but also honestly sympathetic.  Janet Leigh, who did receive a much deserved Oscar nomination, is also flawlessly enticing as Marion Crane.  She commands your attention and draws you into her dilemma masterfully.  The remaining cast is superb as well; John Gavin, Vera Miles, John McIntire and Simon Oakland especially delivering strong performances that support and elevate those of the two leads.<br /><br />When all is said and done there really isn't any fault to be found with Hitchcock's masterpiece.  The final frames of Norman Bates' silent madness are forever locked into my subconscious and still haunt my dreams on occasion.  Sure, there are films that are scarier and more gruesome than this classic but rarely has a film of this genre been able to reach the levels of truly sustained dread that Hitchcock captured; a dread that never leaves, only lies dormant, waiting for the right moment to unleash itself its victims once again.</p></body></html>

Ron Livingston plays corporate drone Peter Gibbons who has a totally unhappy and stressed life. Thanks to the only partially intentional assistance from a therapist using hypnosis in the single funniest scene in the film, Peter relaxes and reaps the rewards of sloth. The films makes a legitimate point about promotion up the corporate ladder in the most humorous manner possible.<br /><br />The characters in the film are all caricatures of idealized cubicle dwellers, and remind me of a cross between "Dilbert" and the cast of "The Office." The film is well acted, and you will see favorite actors from several favorite sitcoms: John C. McGinley from "Scrubs" is brilliant as Bob the consultant; Diedrich Bader from "The Drew Carey Show" is brilliant as a blue collar neighbor, and Jennifer Aniston shines as Joanna, a waitress with flair!<br /><br />The film deserves five stars save for one misstep in postproduction: the soundtrack. The soundtrack is filled with extremely violent rap music, which not only fails to enhance the film, it actually detracts markedly from it.<br /><br />If you are willing to face life in a cube farm, you need to face up to "Office Space," and check out the extras, too. The deleted scenes are, in several cases, absolute highlights: the scene where Peter confronts the receptionist is absolutely priceless, and justifies the cost of the film alone.</p></body></html>

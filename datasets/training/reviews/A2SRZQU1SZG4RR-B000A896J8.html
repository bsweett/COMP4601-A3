<meta name="summary" content="Sweeping Epic Story of  Survival During the Crusades"></head><body><p>Unfortunately this film did not become a major hit at the box office. Yet, it has many fine points which makes it a worthwhile viscerally intense viewing experience. Likely at the time, the public was inundated with sexually appealing epics such as "The Gladiator" and "Alexander". "The Kingdom of Heaven" deserves a closer look for its presentation of the historically important Crusades,  which is the clash of Christianity against Islam in a very volatile region of the world, Palestine, now modern Israel. In the end, the Moslems show mercy on the Christians after a long and bloody battle. There is a very wise and universal message here presented by Saladin, a Moslem leader, which is important for modern times for all of humanity.<br /><br />This rich and deeply moving epic film shows the magnitude and impact of the Crusades on the lives of specific individuals, countries, and the world.  Orlando Bloom is cast as Balian, a French blacksmith, who's wife committed suicide after the death of their child. Per the Catholic religion, she is not allowed proper burial. Her wrapped body is placed at the crossroads as an example to all. Balian is enraged and exacts his revenge upon the clergy when he sees her necklace (with a crucifix) on one of the priests. These events shake his faith in God. In despair, he leave his homeland ...<br /><br />On the road, Balian encounters Crusaders, among whom is the injured knight named Baron Godrey of Ibelin (played by Liam Neeson). Balian learns Godfrey is his father, who is now dying. The scene where Balian prays on a mountainside, entreating God for guidance and to strengthen his faith is very powerful and moving. In another very emotional and solemn ceremony, Balian is blessed by his father and is beknighted not long before his father succombs to battle wounds. Liam Neeson's performance is magnificent, he is totally believable in the role).<br /><br />Priot to arriving in Jerusalem, Balian encounters the enemy in the desert, a Moslem,  with whom he fights and on whom he shows mercy, by not murdering him, instead he takes his horse. Balian learns of the political differences which exist bewteen the Crusaders who are divided into two camps of how to win Jerusalem for Christianity. On his travels in the city, he meets a beautiful Moslem woman Sybella (played to perfection by Eva Green) on horseback. Learning she is the sister to the king, who has leprosy, and is the wife of one of the more influential Europeans whose closeness to the king, gives him an advantage during the political unrest in the region -- their destinies are sure to cross again ...<br /><br />The battle scenes between the Crusaders and Moslems are immense in scope and depth. Balian becomes the leader of the Crusaders against the major battle with Saladin, the Moslem leader. Balian also has a secret liason/ relationship with Sybella - despite her married status and unique position ... Overall, this film has much to offer the viewer interested in an exciting emotionally engaging viewing experience. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bob Marley still rocks the apocalypse"></head><body><p>Interesting mostly for the haunting view of an abandoned New York City, "I Am Legend" follows Will Smith as he tries to redeem himself for his part in unleashing a devastating plague on the world. For the first 2/3'rds of the movie, it's very affecting. Dr Neville (Smith) and dog Sam prowl an abandoned Manhattan, sharing the space with deer, lions and other critters.<br /><br />It's those other critters that amp up the middle of the movie, as Smith does a major boo-boo and grabs a female zombie-mutant plague victim who happens to be best gal pal to the alpha zombie. Seems Dr Neville needs to run tests on muties if he will find a cure and save mankind, yet for some romantic reason, alpha zombie wants his baby back. This conflict made for the best part of "I Am Legend," but the film did not have the good sense to leave it at that. After three years alone with the dark-seekers, another pair of real live humans make it to NYC, and then the film stumbles.<br /><br />I won't go beyond this point, because all other plotlines follow from that moment. What was a strong lead character to this point suddenly gets muddled up, and all the cool CGI in the world can't make drama from stale pudding. However, for the scenes of Smith grooving on Bob Marley and the meditation on "Shrek," this is a pretty good mid-level Science Fiction movie. Frankly, he was better in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN0T">I, Robot</a>, where the CGI didn't overwhelm the real people.</p></body></html>

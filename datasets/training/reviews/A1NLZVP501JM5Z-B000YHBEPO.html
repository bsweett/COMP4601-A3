<meta name="summary" content="What Summer is all about"></head><body><p>Mission Impossible 3 is the perfect summer movie.  Things get blown up, its got a great villain(Phillip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as one of the biggest jerks in a movie since Denethor in the Return of the King) and its got a great twist at the end I did not see coming!  Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise and the other actors are pretty good.  I am going to buy this when it comes out.  It gets summer off well, very well.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A very original and rather clever psychological thriller"></head><body><p>A lot of people didn't really know what to think about this title. The  name American Psycho made it look rather like a  slasher flick which is  what many people expected it to be. I live in Australia and the original  novel is rated R in Australia which means that anyone under 18 can't buy  the book. When I first heard that it had been made into a movie I was a bit  shocked. If a book was bad enough to earn an R rating then I was wondering  how could they go about screening it. But it turns out that they did a  rather good job. The movie still has the same story and a lot of the  bizarre sex and voilence, but it is not nearly as graphic as the book is.  This does not, however let the movie down in any way. Definatelly a worth  see and a fan of the book may be disappointed because of the lack of gore  but will still probably like it. As a DVD, it was given a fairly ordinary  treatment. Although it has stuning picture and sound quality, the extras a  fairly limited. It has the usual theatrical trailer, a five minute  interview with Christian Bale where he tells us how he became involved  in  the film and how he personally feels about the film, a very short making of  documentary that doesn't really reveal all that much, productions notes and  biographies of the cast and crew. It would have been better if it contained  a commentary track by director Mary Harron and Christian Bale, a longer  documentary and also have a section that tells us how Bret Easton Ellis  feels about the movie. Above all, it is a terrific movie that as an ok DVD  release but it required more extras.</p></body></html>

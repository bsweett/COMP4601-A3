Far from a pale retread or an empty star vehicle, "Let Me In" may be the most intelligent and thought-provoking vampire movie ever.<br /><br />The film is set in Los Alamos, New Mexico, in the early 1980s.  Not only does the name "Los Alamos" set an ominous tone from the outset, but the time period is a good one for alienation and abandonment (as well as some pretty good tunes on the soundtrack).  Divorce was growing more and more common, but it was still one of those issues that carried a fair weight of shame.  Naturally, our hero is a kind, meek boy named Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee of "The Road") whose parents are divorcing.  Owen's mother appears to be the short straw in the broken marriage as she's a bit of a religious nut who drowns her agony in wine before she falls asleep on the couch.  Owen's dad seems decent, but he never gets closer to Owen than a concerned phone call.<br /><br />Owen is alone in a cold world.  Friendless and an only child, he's bullied at school by three bigger boys.  The bullying scenes are handled extremely well - they are just as uncomfortable and riveting as the more bloody action scenes the movie has in store.<br /><br />Alone, that is, until the mysterious Abby arrives.  Abby (Chloe Moretz) is either attractively mysterious or mysteriously attractive - she walks through the snow without shoes and doesn't get cold.  Her melancholy dad (Richard Jenkins) is a melancholy, tortured soul, for reasons the movie makes painfully clear.  Jenkins, one of our most under-rated actors, does a magnificent job with his few lines, including his weighty admonition to Abby, "Please stay away from that boy."<br /><br />Owen eventually learns that Abby is a vampire, but he doesn't care - she is kind to him. In a weaker movie, Abby would become Owen's guardian angel, dispensing comeuppances and one-liners while allowing Owen to become his school's alpha dog.  "Let Me In" has another message - there is a high price to be paid for being a vampire's friend.  Indeed, Abby's dad really isn't her dad, but instead someone who knows all too well what's in store for Owen should he get too close to Abby.<br /><br />Violent without being a bloodfest, scary without resorting to the "jump-out-from-behind-the-door" cliches that the "Scream" franchise mocked so well, "Let Me In" is a true horror movie.  The movie's final scene, innocent enough on its face, sends chills down your spine as you realize the lifetime of horrors that await.  It's not perfect, but after the years of "Buffy," "Twilight," and other campy vampire stuff "Let Me In" represents a triumphant return of horror to the vampire genre.</p></body></html>

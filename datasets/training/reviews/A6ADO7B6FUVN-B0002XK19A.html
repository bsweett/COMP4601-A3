Quickly the film jumps into action as Spider-Man a.k.a. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) must save the day as he struggles to keep his job as a pizza delivery boy while maintaining good status as a science student at Columbia University.  This is a difficult balancing act for Parker who also works as a freelance photographer for the Daily Bugle where the owner, J. J. Jameson, does everything possible to make life sour for Spider-Man.  Moreover, the most difficult issue for Parker to tackle is what his uncle once taught him, "with great powers comes great responsibility", as he must withstand his love for Mary Jane in order to protect her from his enemies.<br /><br />The balancing act performed by Parker is catching up with him as it causes him great stress, which in the end begins to negatively influence his life.  Parker's grades are slipping, as he must write a paper, which he has decideds to write on Dr. Octavius (Alfred Molina), a prominent physicist.  It happens to be that Dr. Octavius works for Harry Osborn (James Franco), Parker's friend and father of the late Green Goblin, as he is developing fusion in order to provide the world with free electricity.  However, the experiment goes wrong and it creates the monster Dr. Octopus, which soon becomes Spider-Man's new archenemy.<br /><br />Internally Parker struggles with what most people face everyday, choices and the stress brought upon him through his choices, as they influence those around him.  However, his choices have a slightly grander influence on people as he saves lives and fights against evil.  Parker also envies the normality of humanity, which he feels that he cannot have, as he must use his great powers responsibly.  This struggle produces an overburden of stress and seems to weaken him in all aspects of life, as he also finds himself pushing away the people for which he cares.<br /><br />Spider-Man is a roller coaster that brings the audience through the high and lows of Parker's life, as he struggles with his existential identity.  The director Sam Raimi projects this internal struggle onto the silver screen through popular psychology and a heavy dose of scripted dialogue, which is at times a little awkward.  The method in which Raimi portrays Parker's difficult position in life comes across to the audience a little too straightforward.  This straightforwardness makes the internal struggle seem slightly absurd, much like our contemporary pop culture's need for instant gratification.  The notion of instant gratification ushers thoughts to ponder that the making of Spider-Man 2 was hastened, as the film does not leave anything for the audience to ponder.  However, Spider-Man is a superhero and it is expected that he will win as he brings his justice to evil.  Nonetheless, it is intriguing to see Raimi depict the human side of Parker.<br /><br />Sam Raimi does a great job telling the story of Parker and his endeavors as he goes about to find a solution to his problems.  The detailed computer generated images and cool special effects provide spellbinding action as Spider-Man attempts to win over evil.  However, the sequel does not deliver the same caliber of work as the predecessor did, which offered more for the audience to reflect upon as Parker had to learn how to live with his gift.</p></body></html>

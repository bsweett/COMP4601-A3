<meta name="summary" content="This movie is HALF-RIGHT because: ORIGINAL PLOT + Good acting of the acctress portraying Eli +  SLow Pace"></head><body><p>WARNING! SPOILERS, please do not read further if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the movie.<br /><br />This movie is HALF-RIGHT because of the reasons listed below.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />- The plot is ORIGINAL. I've never seen a movie where a girl of 12 years old was a vampire. She killed and sucked the blood out of people.<br /><br />- The movie brings up a social dilemma. That is if a child of 12 years committed a murder, should he/she be tried as an adult or a juvenile? What makes some people angry is juvenile punishment is like a slap on the wrist.<br /><br />- The acting of the actress who portrays Eli is fascinating. She makes me keep watching and watching.<br /><br />- There are some very bloody scenes that will keep gore fans happy.<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />- The pace is slow compared to Hollywood movies.<br /><br />- The main actor who portrays Oskar does not show emotion on his face.<br /><br />- There's no suspense. Curiosity is what made me watching this till the end, not suspense.<br /><br />- There's one scene which is very disturbing. In my opinion, it borders child pornography. That is the scene where Eli visited Oskar in his apartment. Oskar had her changed in to one of his mother's dresses. Then he accidentally saw her private part. Why did the director have to include that scene? It does not have anything to do with the plot at all.<br /><br />Overall, it's absolutely worth watching.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still my fav. King adaptation to date!!"></head><body><p>"Carrie" from the mid 1970's remains among the very best in horror cinema even today! The atmosphere holds a solid chill in my bones from start to finish. The performances by the two leads Sissy and Piper are Oscar worthy! The rest of the cast fall right in order with perfection. The films finale in the gym and to the closing credits is shot with brilliance by the superb Brian DePalma. "Carrie" "may" be the best Stephen King adaptation ever.. it differs from the book in ways but, it still holds true to the just of the novel enough for me. Both the movie and the book stand on their own.. you can watch the movie and be surprised by things that arent in the book and vice versa. Of course with all book to movie films, there is always things from the book that do not make it to the motion picture. This film is a true tale of revenge and, deserves to be hailed as the masterpiece it is!<br /><br />Other good King adaptations: "Stand by me", "The Shawshank Redemption", "Misery", "Dolores Claiborne", "The Green Mile", "Pet Sematary", "The Shining".</p></body></html>

Jaws is one of them. This is one of those old thrillers that you simply CANNOT miss. Yeah yeah, everyone knows that not all sharks are dangerous (we scare them more than they scare us), but this is a MOVIE. And boy is it a movie! It's not only the classic scares that make the film, but the characters Brody and Quint and Hooper are all equally interesting. It's almost a spectacle when these men of different backgrounds try to take down the big one in the second half of the film. Plus, the dialogue is easily recognizable ("I got no spit."). The one thing that bothers me about this film is that the shark kills my favorite character near the end. What a shame.<br /><br />But other than that, this classic remains a classic. The sequels . . . meh. Part Three was good, but Parts Two and Four are the weakest.<br /><br />A-</p></body></html>

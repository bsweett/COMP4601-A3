<meta name="summary" content="Very good remake"></head><body><p>It was with this movie that I found out that Johnny Depp was such an adept actor. He has acted in my movies and they are all very different characters that he has played previously. I enjoyed this movie because it gave a whole new spin on the old version of the movie. I really liked and enjoyed the new spin with new music and a new Willy Wonka character. You will really enjoy this version. It is for the whole family!!!</p></body></html>

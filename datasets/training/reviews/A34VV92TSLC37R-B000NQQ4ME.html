<meta name="summary" content="Mayan version of Braveheart, but with an inherent message that only Mel could deliver"></head><body><p>Whether you like Mel Gibson or not, one has to admit that he, as a director, is one of the few names that will grab your attention completely when attached to a film.  I guarantee that both those people who love Mel and those who hate him know all there is to know about Apocalypto whether they have seen it or not.  And the sad thing is that a lot of people will not see this film simply because of who the director is, and that's a shame.<br /><br />I love Mel Gibson.  Braveheart might be the best film of the '90s.  Passion was one of the most raw, gutwrenching, unflinching films I have ever seen.  And Apocalypto follows those two films with another obscure yet applicable tale that only Mel Gibson could tell, and tell it so unbelievably well.<br /><br />At the beginning, we are introduced to Jaguar Paw, who lives in a small, peaceful village seemingly apart from the rest of the Mayan world.  On a hunt one morning, Jaguar Paw's group encounters a group of "refugees" in an extremely haunting sequence.  These refugees have obvious fear in their eyes, and only want to pass through the grounds to make a new beginning for themselves far away.  Shortly after this encounter, Jaguar Paw's village is attacked by a tribe of ruthless Mayans who seek to capture most members of the village for who knows what.  During the melee, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and son in a hole on the outskirts of the village before he is eventually captured.  Once Jaguar Paw is captured, we go on a journey with him to a disturbing, captivating vision of what the Mayan civilization had come to at its end times.  The journey to the Mayan city takes up most of the film, and encompasses most of the film's message, which could be taken many different ways.  After certain events have occurred in the city, the film turns into a massive chase sequence through the  Mayan jungle, and a final payoff/ambiguous ending that once again speaks clearly as to why Mel Gibson must be respected as a filmmaker.<br /><br />Apocalypto is a film that is not only drenched in its director's vision, but it is also helped immensely by the presence of that vision.  The brutality of some Mayan tribes must be present here to help us understand how bad it was, and the violence in the film does a lot to help us understand it.  By no means is the violence pointless, but it is extremely graphic and brutal; what else would we expect from Mel?<br /><br />I've read reviews about the film that say that Jaguar Paw is Jesus.  Some have said that it is Mel's statement against the war in Iraq.  Others have said it is a statement about our social culture.  The bottom line is that every viewer can have their own interpretation of the film, and that is what makes it so great.  Mel Gibson, as a director, demands that we think and interpret for ourselves.  As a viewer, you are being asked a lot to sit through this film.  It's all in subtitles to Mayan dialect.  The violence is brutal and disgusting to some.  The film is long, as is necessary for it to resolve its story through its own volition.<br /><br />One of the film's sequences will haunt me for a long time to come.  On the journey to the city, the captors and captives encounter a small girl who is infected with "the sickness."  As they pass the girl, and treat her like they would a diseased animal, her appearance/demeanor changes and she proceeds to give them a long, detailed, doom-filled prophecy.  This sequence is stunning, and absolutely haunting, for many reasons that can't even be explained.  It just needs to be experienced.<br /><br />So whether you like Mel Gibson or not, enjoy the experience of watching one of his films while you still can.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jigsaw Tells His Twisted Tale"></head><body><p>Saw was and still is an amazing movie, and to me there is no movie killer more genius than Jigsaw, with the exception of Hannibal, of course. His unique traps and his twisted altruism just attracts you to his character. It's virtually impossible to hate this man, especially after the twist in the last movie. Not only that, but he's capable of fulfilling that old saying "Fool me once..." blah blah. Saw II is the "fool me twice" part of that saying.<br /><br />Though since Saw ended by revealing the identity of the killer known as Jigsaw, Saw II obviously had to go in another direction. And surprisingly, the twists in this one are as convincing as they were in the last one. It's just difficult to talk about them in the review without spoiling the movie. So I'll say this straight off: If you loved Saw then there is absolutely no reason why you can't love this. And if you hated Saw, perhaps because of the gore, then obviously stay away. Saw II did everything good (depending on your interpretation of "good") that the first movie did and adds some.<br /><br />Since good horror films are so sparse (is this even a horror film, or a suspense/thriller), I can't recommend this movie enough. Saw II achieves what only the best horror movies are able to achieve. It gets into your skin. You'll jump, you'll turn your head, you may even gag once or twice, but either way you feel the effects of this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A classic horror tale with a definitive "Hey, it's that guy!" cast, plus Kurt Russell"></head><body><p>John Carptenter's mastery of the horror genre needs no exposition from me - he's established himself a dozen times over.  His remake of 1951's "The Thing" may not rise to the legendary heights of "Halloween," but it remains one of the ten best horror flicks of the 1980s.<br /><br />Set in Antarctica in "Winter, 1982," the movie feels very modern thanks to the rumpled machismo of the cast - Kurt Russell and his band of roughnecks would be equally at home in any horror movie set today (with the limited mention of some dated '80s ethnic slang and boom-boxes).  Indeed, the only big miss with the movie is the idea that the movie was filmed during the Antarctic winter - anyone who has seen "March of the Penguins" knows that Antarctica can be a much more violent place than the sunny, bucolic vistas Carpenter often uses.  This is a minor quibble.<br /><br />The movie opens with a bizarre scene of Norwegians shooting at a racing Husky from a helicopter.  The Husky arrives at an American scientific outpost and fares much better than the Norwegians there.  All too soon we see that there is something incredibly different about this Husky and that the roughnecks realize it far too late.<br /><br />What ensues is a nasty bit of body-snatching that is the perfect bit of hell for a bunch of guys trapped at the bottom of the earth.  You're literally cut off from the world down there - what are you going to do when it's possible that the guy next to you is actually an alien replicant striving to infect the planet?<br /><br />Terrific special effects, strong performances, and creepy-as-all-get-out scenes fill this movie - a must-see for all fans of horror movies.</p></body></html>

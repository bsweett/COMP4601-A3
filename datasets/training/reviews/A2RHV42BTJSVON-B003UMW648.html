Chronicles of Narnia, for me, is almost worse than watching a Harry Potter movie because I am so familiar with the story and mythology behind the movies.<br /><br />  The story begins with a birth, the birth of Prince Caspian's uncle's first son, which means he can kill off Caspian so that his son can have the throne.  Prince Caspian then runs off on horseback and goes into the forest of Narnia where he runs into a badger and two dwarfs, and blows a horn to summon the kings and queens of old.  Of course, we also see Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan as they are going about their daily lives wondering whether or not they will ever go back to Narnia.  It is, of course, just as they are wondering this that they are pulled back into to Narnia.  They soon find that quite some time has passed since they were Kings and Queens in Narnia and things are not as peaceful and pleasant as they were when they left.<br /><br />  Overall, I would give the movie a 4.5.  It is sad to say that this almost seems like a lesser version of Lord of the Rings, but it does.  This does not make it a bad film at all, it is just that the battle sequences are not bloody at all, but the film still has almost just as much violence as Lord of the Rings.  One of the major things that keeps it from really feeling like its own movie is the fact that they left out fair amounts of elements of magical creatures from the books, and brought in Aslan far too late.  Aslan comes into the books much earlier, and it never fully explained why Peter, Susan, and Edmund couldn't see Aslan at first either.<br /><br />  This movie almost could have earned a PG-13 rating because of the adult themes of power struggles within in the family and murder conspiricies.  This is not light stuff, and I would not take anyone under ten to see it, it is quite violent, but there are so many redeeming qualities that I wouldn't throw the baby out with the bath water.<br /><br />  These were the most frustrating points for me, but overall, the movie was well-acted, well-filmed, good script, good effects, and was fairly evenly paced.  Part of the problem of filming these books is that in general, not a whole lot goes on.  The books are very casual in tone, and not quite as engrossing as say Harry Potter.  Although, I would probably say that Chronicles of Narnia is much more original than Harry Potter.<br /><br />  I would defnitely go see it again because I believe I will enjoy it more than I did at the midnight showing I saw.  I definitely hope that they continue filming these because it would be marvelous to see all seven books filmed. I very much enjoyed seeing the children moore grown up, I do hope they come back for "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader" as that is probably my favorite book. Next time Disney, cash in more on C.S. Lewis' wonderful world, and make sure to include the Dufflepods! :D<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More like theater than a movie"></head><body><p>Although it's a tough call to say which of the John Hughes movies had the most heart in them - as he did choose a medium of completely vain and self centered teenagers - I believe The Breakfast Club was probably the most artisticly inclined and showcased the most talent of them all.<br /><br />A bunch of kids from the same high school from different walks of life and social casts have come together for a Saturday of detention.  They are an unusual mix of people (a Weirdo, a Delinqent, a Nerd, a Princess, and a Jock) all put together in one room for a day.  Here they are forced to look at each other which contemplating their detention assignment - writing an essay about what makes them them.  This was obviously meant to punish, but turns them into talking about themselves in ways they otherwise wouldn't and the play unfolds.<br /><br />It was odd to see Molly Ringwald here as the snotty popular girl when she is perhaps more famous for being the outcast.  Here she will only speak to the Jock as she considers him to be her equal and not the others until the Delinquent Judd Nelson bullies his way into cracking her shell.  And eating sushi for lunch with chopsticks?  That's a little strange.  Ally Sheedy, however, stole this movie in my opinion.  She is the sullen, twitching creep in the back.  The sandwich!  Who can forget that?!  And using her own dandruff on the drawing of the snowy day!  And we find out she wasn't in detention, she just didn't have anything else to do that day!!!  HA!  Anthony Michael Hall reappeared as the drooling Nerd once again, but he was probably the most dangerous of them all as he was in detention for bringing a gun to school.  And the Jock, Emilio Estevez, which is a sort of bad guy is actually pretty likable.<br /><br />Why not 5 stars?  Judd Nelson.  Judd Nelson as the Delinquent was just exactly that.  He was annoying, obnoxious, insecure, and proved nothing except that his bad behavior earned him the next six months of detention Saturdays.  He was a rebel without  a clue.  Know what's really scary though?  I remember my first real boyfriend used to look and dress like him, he even had those gloves with the fingers cut off if I remember correctly.  *Yikes!*</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Implausible Pieces"></head><body><p>Signs of trouble:<br />(1.) English subtitles and audio don't match which indicates a lack of attention to detail by the producers; foretelling more issues to follow.<br />(2.) Heavy reliance on rape, incest, bondage, religious and Nazi fanaticism that didn't really seem plausible and were so disjointed that these pieces failed to meld together in a plausible manner. The writer/director know that the more controversy you can toss into a pot (plot) the more it sells.<br />(3.) Intellectual detective work seemed like pure imagination and lacked any believability especially the degree to which a low level sophisticated hacker easily and conveniently found obscure non-database linked information either on his/her computers or in their searches. It would take a lab full of CIA hackers/programmers, with the most sophisticated technology, months to get most but not all that was shown in this movie.<br />(4.) The story lacked depth and with only tidbits of history behind each character the story seemed like piecework. The result is that the viewer never feels as if they are a part of anyone's story. Just a viewing rabbit jumping from scene to scene.<br />(5.) The investigator and tattooed assistant made insights and connections between events that barely seemed plausible even to an omniscient viewing audience. Taping photos to a wall looks good on film but barely works in real life.<br />(6.) How does a hooded, overly pierced and overly dragon tattooed girl contribute to the storyline other than writer/director has an obsession with the bizarre and it sells to a sedated audience. The tattoo means?</p></body></html>

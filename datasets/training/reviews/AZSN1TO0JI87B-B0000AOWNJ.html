<meta name="summary" content="It's Just Not Scary..."></head><body><p>"The Ring" is yet another in a long line of movies that just can't live up to it's own hype. Hearing stories about people freaking out in theaters and odd things happening at home during viewings made me think I was in for one hell of a thrill. Despite the fact that I had my own eerie experience while watching this -- my phone started ringing at exactly the same time as the phone in the opening scene -- I still couldn't feel any intensity, any chills, or any entertainment. I don't ask much of my horror movies, not much at all, they don't have to be scary or full of gore (afterall, this is the guy who LIKED "Open Water"), just as long as I can make some sort of connection and they entertain me for the 90+ minutes they run in. "The Ring" doesn't do that. Instead, we are subjected to a very good looking, but pretentious picture as done by "Pirates Of The Caribbean" (another movie that had way too much hype) director, Gore Virbinski. Virbinski is no doubt a skilled director, but there is just too much eye candy here, as opposed to actual plot. Not for one minute did I really feel any characters were in danger, and the pace just kept going up and down so much that it just got annoying. Each time I would start to engage myself in the happenings, the movie would just let go of me. The overall story leaves much to be desired, and the ending makes absolutely no sense. I honestly don't understand how this movie could become such a phenomenom. Maybe it's just me. I know I need something a little more visceral to scare me or at least entertain me. "The Ring" is just a whole lotta nothing. There is one scene where a horse commits suicide that might arouse the sleepy haze that will most likely come over you, but it really has no other purpose to the story, and much like everything else in the movie, it was put there just to make you uncomfortable (it made me giggle uncontrollably). Towards the end of the movie, my dog barfed up a considerably large amount of food on my bed. Now that, my friends, is scary.</p></body></html>

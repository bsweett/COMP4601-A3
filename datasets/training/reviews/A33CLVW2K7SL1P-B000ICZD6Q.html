<meta name="summary" content="Not what I expected"></head><body><p>This was a movie that I expected to be light, funny, romantic, and above all, formulaic. I was right on all but the last assumption.<br /><br />This wasn't a deep movie: it's classified as both drama and comedy. In other words, this isn't Million Dollar Baby. There are extremely funny moments in the film. When Quaid, playing fifty two year old Dan Foreman, tries to dunk during a basketball game, the ball gets stuck between the rim and the backboard, and Foreman takes a wicked fall, hurting his arm. That type of physical humor is always good for a laugh.<br /><br />There's the obvious comedic element, of course, of Carter Duryea (played very convincingly and impressively by Topher Grace) taking Foreman's old job after a corporate take over, being Foreman's boss. (It's a bit strange referring to someone as "Foreman" when that person isn't Topher Grace; especially when Grace is in the film.)<br /><br />There's romance: Duryea falls in love with Foreman's daughter, Alex (Scarlet Johannsen) in an interesting twist on falling in love with the boss's daughter. Here, he falls in love with the former boss's daughter.<br /><br />Here's what we expect.<br /><br />-Foreman's wife is pregnant. He is excited, and asks if it is a boy. He wants a boy, and this generally means it will be a boy, in the very final scenes of the typical formulaic movie.<br /><br />-Duryea and Alex fall in love and have a secret romance. Alex breaks up with him after (another hysterical moment) her father catches them. There's the typical boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl setup here).<br /><br />-When Foreman catches his daughter with Duryea, he decks Duryea. One would imagine that a boss would automatically fire their employee.<br /><br />As I'm writing this, I realize there are several others that I could outline, and then say: some happen, some don't. But the others give away much of the fun of the movie, and I don't want to spoil that for anyone.<br /><br />I expected to walk away from this film enjoying it mildly, giving it perhaps three stars, but walked out liking it much more because it didn't do what I expected it to do. Not that the plot twists are going to knock your socks off like the ending of The Sixth Sense, but they're still fun.</p></body></html>

This really is a shame, because Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris' debut feature is second only to Rian Johnson's "Brick" as the best American film so far this year, and a more surefire crowd-pleaser than Johnson's more stylized film. But "Little Miss Sunshine" is not a movie that wows you; it sidles up to you, tickling your ribs gently at first, then gradually turning up the laugh meter as it progresses until, before you realize it, you're covered in popcorn and spilled Coke from rolling in the aisles. Like other recent quirky comedies--"Sideways," "Garden State," and "The Squid and the Whale"--"Little Miss Sunshine" mines unforgettable humor from the lives of desperate characters who are lovable despite their glaring character flaws. The plot is simple: The six members of the Hoover family pile into a decrepit VW bus for an 800-mile trek to California so that daughter Olive can compete in the "Little Miss Sunshine" beauty pageant finals. All of them are smarting from separate, painful insults to their egos and their hopes, and along the way each one suffers a final, crushing blow--in one case, with extreme prejudice. The beauty of "Little Miss Sunshine" is that it overcomes all this sorrow to become a joyous experience. No other recent film has demonstrated how thin a line there is between tragedy and comedy, or the crucial difference between embracing life and despairing of it. The buoyancy of the screenplay is matched by the absolute perfection of the ensemble cast. It's virtually impossible to single any of them out, they are all so good. I have to admit a predilection for Alan Arkin and Steve Carell, but I don't want to shortchange the shining, sparkling contributions of Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear, Paul Dano and little Abigail Breslin, an almost frighteningly gifted child actress. All I can say is, at the next Screen Actors Guild award show, when the "Best Comedy Ensemble" award is announced, they had better read these names, in alphabetical order: Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano, and Greg Kinnear. If they do not, rioting in the streets will be completely warranted.</p></body></html>

I too thought that the story was lighthearted and entertaining as well. We both had the simple desire to be entertained, on a Sunday afternoon and "Journey to the Center of the Earth" fit the bill.<br /><br />Sean, a young teen who has lived most of his life without the benefit of a father (an adventurer gone missing), is being forced to spend time with his uncle Trevor (his father's brother, a professor).While going thru several items belonging to his missing, yet presumed dead father, they discover a book that yields clues to his possible whereabouts and could unlock the mystery to a magical world. Jumping on a plane to follow the clues, Trevor and Sean try to build a relationship that they both can benefit from, while deciphering clues. As they arrive in Iceland, the adventure begins with the addition of a beautiful mountain guide Hannah, whose father and Trevor's brother were ultimately connected because of similar beliefs. As all three struggle to believe in the impossible, we are dazzled by glowing birds, amazing, waterslides, angry dinosaurs, large attacking Venus fly traps, and other moments of wonderful special effects.<br /><br />"Journey to the Center of the Earth" is a wonderful family drama that had everything you could hope for. You had romance and comedy (uncle and nephew argued over who would get the girl), there were tender moments (when Trevor finds resolution to what happened to his brother 10 years earlier), and very entertaining special effects. So, if you want to watch an easy going, light adventure, this is the movie for you.</p></body></html>

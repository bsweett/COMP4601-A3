<meta name="summary" content="A surprisingly endearing love story"></head><body><p>When I first saw the previews for the Lake House I thought the plot was completely implausible and that there was no way I could possibly enjoy such a far-fetched romance. I was wrong. Sandra Bullock plays an overworked doctor at a busy Chicago hospital who finds solace on her time off by visiting her lake house. Keanu Reeves plays an architect whose father build the lakehouse, and who lives in it at the same time as Bullock, though two years earlier. The two correspond through letters placed in the mailbox and develop an affection for each other that transcends time. After awhile they begin to make plans to meet each other in Reeves' future and Bullock's present, but their plans just keep falling through. They begin to wonder if time is a barrier that they can't overcome.<br /><br />So while the two-year time difference may seem like it would make the love story hard to follow, it completely makes sense within the context of this film. These two people are living completely different lives and the only thing they have in common is this house, which for both of them is a source of solace and peace in their otherwise hectic lives. The way they fall in love is completely believable and I couldn't help but hope that they would be able to overcome the distance that time placed between them and find a way to be together in the present. Even if you don't typically like love stories, I'd suggest giving the Lake House a try. I was skeptical, but I'm glad that I gave it a chance.</p></body></html>

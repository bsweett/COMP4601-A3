<meta name="summary" content="Past glory in high tech world"></head><body><p>Disbelief might be an understatement. A single sloppy employee could cause such colossal havoc by his mere inability to run, walk, or climb stairs? In a modern high tech world, a train company has no remote access to the engine of an unmanned train? It sounded like 9/11 revisited, where simple human failure could cause such immense loss of lives.<br /><br />It starts with a heavy weight, unfit, and apparently semi-dead employee who was entrusted to drive a freight train. The moviemaker would put that poor guy in many spots along the scenes in order too invoke anger on his miserable human condition. Aside from such petty display, the photography of the scenes was mediocre at best with poor angling and zooming that made things unreal.<br /><br />Even though the action was unstoppable, it was shocking to see the dismal technical failure of a train company where no one seems to know how to stop an unmanned train. With the millions of dollars spent to build such vast resources, a remote control from Toys-R-Us would sound a perfect solution to kill the engine of fright train that ran loose from a sleazy employee.<br /><br />The first attempt to slow the train, with another leading train, sounded foolishly stupid according to any law of conservation of momentum or energy. The second method of shooting at the fuel tanks of the train with police guns sounded equally stupid. Then came the derailing blocks that shattered on impact. Dynamiting the rails have been played in movies for many decades and would have stopped the unstoppable train in a safe location. It is hard to imagine that the state of Pennsylvania lacked such expertise in explosives similar to those deployed in Yugoslavia and Iraq where structures were hit from hundreds of miles away with GPS technology and laser guided missiles.<br /><br />The third attempt to pull the train from its rear end did not differ much from the first one. So, where did all the brains migrate? It started with an attempt to land a man on the train from a Helicopter.  Yet, somehow all the Helicopters that were shown in the movie could not catch up with the 70 mph unmanned train. Who did? an off duty worker chasing the train on parallel roads in his pick up truck?<br /><br />It all sounded like some heroes from the far past have come to live to save a freight company that could not afford to hire a high school pupil knowledgeable with the laws of motion. What started with dropping a man into the train cabinet, ended by accomplishing that with twists of cursing, heroism, and plenty of bureaucratic red tapes. Every police officer shown in the movie appeared miserably overweight and could hardly breathe, let alone think or act.</p></body></html>

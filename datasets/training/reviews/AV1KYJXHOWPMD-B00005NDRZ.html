But this DVD just sucks. The Shinning was shot in full-screen, so this DVD is cropped. Also this DVD is missing over 20 minutes of footage. I repeat: Steer clear of this crappy DVD.<br />Stick with the last release, because it does the film justice.<br /><br />P.S. The only one of these 5 new releases of Kubrick's films that is worth buying is 2001: A Space Odyssey. The rest are not worth buying.</p></body></html>

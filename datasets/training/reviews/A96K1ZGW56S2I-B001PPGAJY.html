X-MEN gave a nice introduction to some of the basic characters and set the stage for what was to come later. X2 begins not long after X-MEN ended. Wolverine is searching for his past; Rogue and Iceman have started a relationship; Magneto is still in prison; and so on and so forth. The film steadily builds leading from one critical moment to the next, until we finally reach the film's climax at a Canadian dam.<p>X2 is a far superior film than X-MEN. The first movie was basically a live action cartoon, moved by action rather than character. X2 is the opposite, it is an action film, but one with substance, moved forward by character and motive rather than action and special effects. Watching the film, I felt as though I was watching a modern Shakespearean play set against the backdrop of a comic book. There aren't very many action films that can do that.<p>This is a movie that all people will enjoy, whether they know anything about the X-Men or not.</p></body></html>

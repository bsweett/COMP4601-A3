In Waitress, Keri Russell plays Jenna, a small-town Southern woman stuck in a loveless marriage. Her control-freak husband won't buy her a car (he doesn't want her to go anywhere), and he systematically collects her paycheck and tips each week so she won't have enough money to leave him.<br /><br />In addition to waiting tables at Joe's Pie Shop, Jenna creates a daily special pie. All of her pies are delicious (her co-workers call her a "pie genius"), and they all have quirky names like "Spanish Dancer Pie," "Bad Baby Pie," and "Kick in the Pants Pie." Jenna loves making pies, and it's her dream to attend a pie cook-off and take first prize.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie, Jenna learns that she's pregnant. And though she's keeping the baby, she's pretty miserable about it. When she goes in to her obgyn to confirm the news, she discovers that her staid old doctor has been replaced. Her new doctor is a young, hot, GUY. Dr. Pomatter (played adorably by Nathan Fillion) is immediately attracted to Jenna, and before long, the two are enjoying a torrid affair.<br /><br />As her relationship with Dr. Pomatter develops, Jenna begins to understand some things about herself and her life. She realizes that maybe she doesn't have to be stuck with her abusive husband. And that maybe her pie-making isn't just playing, but her own unique form of artistry.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film. Great performances throughout. And though the plot is not an original one, the treatment of it is beautiful. The ending is satisfying, and nearly all the characters are rounded, likable, relatable people. I loved it. Did I mention I loved it?</p></body></html>

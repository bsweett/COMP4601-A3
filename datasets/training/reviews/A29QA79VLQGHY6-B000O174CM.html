<meta name="summary" content="What's on the DVDs"></head><body><p>Paramount just announced "Dreamgirls" for May 1, the campaign starring a double-disc "Showstopper Edition" with a glitzy package of extras. The title also is coming out with in two-DVD sets for both HD formats (unusual) and a single-disc DVD version with some deleted scenes.<br /><br />The box art mentions Jennifer Hudson's Oscar, but the big type goes to the film's Golden Globe for best picture. Smart marketing since the movie didn't make the cut to get into the Academy Awards' best pic race.<br /><br />Par promises "12 extended and alternate scenes including a DVD-exclusive, never-before-seen performance by Jennifer Hudson of 'Effie Sing My Song,' a feature-length documentary entitled 'Building the Dream' presented in nine chapters, behind-the-scenes featurettes on the costume design, editing and lighting of the film, cast member auditions and screen tests, previsualization sequences and more." Most but not all of the extras come formatted for HD.<br /><br />Specs: Widescreen enhanced for 16:9 TVs (single disc also available full screen) with Dolby Digital English 5.1 Surround, English 2.0 Surround and French 5.1 Surround with English and Spanish subtitles. Sorry, audio buffs, no DTS. It's a real shame to see a musical this rich come out without the superior audio format. Perhaps the HD formats will get to show off their superior sound abilities, an upgrade that by and large we're still waiting to experience. Guy can dream, right?</p></body></html>

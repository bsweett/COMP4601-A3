I can't imagine what Spielberg was thinking when he threw this film together. It's a long, long way from the previous installments in the franchise.<br /><br />Harrison Ford looks bored out of his mind and who wouldn't be. It's not that he's too old or anything it's just that there is nothing much for him to do apart from spew loads of exposition (the previous films kept this to a minimum). Up until this installment every Indy film had several key, iconic scenes. Be it a tumbling rock or a mine car chase there was something standout and memorable about all of them. There's nothing like that here, nothing.<br /><br />The pre-release hype reminded me a lot Bruce Willis talking-up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VNMMQ6">Live Free or Die Hard [Blu-ray</a>] the previous summer. He assured that the film would be 'old school' and was 'the best one yet'. And then when it did finally come out it was a PG-13 family movie filled with CGI effects. So much for old school. Spielberg tried to hype Indy IV with the same logic. He'd be shooting in Panavision (sadly not as common as it used to be), editing the old-fashioned way and using as many non-computer-generated effects as possible.<br /><br />Well, that turned out to be a lie. Crystal Skull looks far too slick to be in the same category as Douglas Slocombe's fantastically dark photography of the first three. Not only is CGI prevalent throughout there is also extensive use of digital mattes which look totally out of place in an Indy film. In no way does this look or feel like either of the three movies that preceded it.<br /><br />I have read that Frank Darabont wrote the original script which both Spielberg and Ford loved but George Lucas (who has been flogging his one long-dead horse since 1977 for all it's worth) hated it. I have no idea what that script was about but I have no doubt that it was miles better than what we finally got. Aliens simply do NOT belong in an Indy film. Lucas can force that nonsense on us in his endless Star Wars series as much as he wants but not here, Sir. And on top of that the plot doesn't even make sense and is very poorly delivered to the viewer, excessive exposition or not. Indy IV feels more like a rejected Mummy 3 script than anything else.<br /><br />Karen Allen returns as Marion but has next to nothing to do apart from drive a car-boat and tag along with the already bloated cast. Indy, Mutt, Mac, Ox and Marion all searching for an ancient treasure while being pursued by (a gorgeous) Cate Blanchett. My God is this friggin' ain't <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QFW7UA">The Goonies [Blu-ray</a>], man. And despite the PG-13 rating it is probably the tamest Indy film yet. Look at the final scene in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)</a> with the exploding heads and melting faces. How brilliant and timeless is that? It's pure imagination mixed with great make-up effects and it's a finale that everyone remembers. Irina Spalko (who does not one evil thing in the whole movie) meets an altogether much lazier fate. I won't ruin it for you despite already having given most of the ending away but I will say that it's quick and unaffecting and looks like it came out of a video game.<br /><br />When all else fails you could usually turn to John Williams for comfort. Sorry folks, but Williams (along with everyone else, it seems) is strictly phoning it in for this one. His themes are lazy, boring and instantly forgettable. Don't expect anything as awesome as 'Parade of the Slave Children' or 'Desert Chase' here. The Ark of the Covenant theme can be heard near the start but all the new material is as bland as it can get.<br /><br />Indy IV should never have happened. If the series MUST have been continued then a big-screen Young Indiana Jones adventure would have held so much more potential. The Young Indy series is exactly what you need to watch if you feel let down by this time-wasting potboiler. Though I did appreciate the Young Indiana Jones reference about half an hour into it. I wonder how many people picked up on that.<br /><br />Spielberg has lost it. Plain and simple.</p></body></html>

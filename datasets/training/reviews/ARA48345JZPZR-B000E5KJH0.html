<meta name="summary" content="The conceit is better than the execution..."></head><body><p>I enjoyed the idea that The Graduate, both book and movie, was really a disguised true story of a friend of author Charles Webb's who actually did sleep with an older woman, the infamous Mrs. Robinson, and later fell-in-love and slept with her daughter who then married another.  That the grandaughter of the former and daughter of the latter discovers it might be her family that was being written about and sets out to discover the truth was a clever conceit and might have made a pretty good movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this ain't it.  While it has all the elements, including Jennifer Aniston as the young woman, a nicely laid-back Kevin Costner as Beau Burroughs the real-life model for Benjamin Braddock in the book and film, and what should have been an easy homerun for Shirley Maclaine as the prototype for Mrs. Robinson, ends up being flat-footed comically, awkward romantically and just off-kilter in direction, performance and tone.  The comedy is forced and unfunny, the sentimentality and emotion un-earned.<br /><br />I don't know what has happened to Rob Reiner whose early work was marked by such superb manipulation and timing of all these elements of comedy, emotion and sentimentality, but none of it works here.  It's not that this is a bad film, it just isn't a real good film.  It's so-so and it should have been more.  Maybe add a 1/2 star for the likeable cast.</p></body></html>

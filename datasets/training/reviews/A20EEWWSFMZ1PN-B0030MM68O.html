<meta name="summary" content="Love among bomb techs (EOD)"></head><body><p>This movie is repetitive and boring. The same cowboy (Jeremy Renner) rushes in where wise men never tread to dismantle bombs, dismantle people, and dismantle our time. All the characters are one-dimensional. The story does not have any redeeming social value. There is no rhyme or reason; there is just a bunch of explosions and more explosions and more explosions.<br /><br />They did borrow a tad from "All Quiet on the Western Front" by sending the dissenbomer home to an environment that did not understand him.<br /><br />I would give you more details about the film but that is all there is. Okay takes place in Iraq 2004.<br />Actual filming Locations are "Amman, Jordan", "Kuwait", and "Langley, British Columbia, Canada."<br /><br />The Blu-ray has a voice over commentary. This explains why this looks like one long commercial for a film by people that were just reporters.</p></body></html>

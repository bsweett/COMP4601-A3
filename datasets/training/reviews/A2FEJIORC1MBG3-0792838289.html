For serious fans of the original version this is actually a good thing, for two reasons: 1. The new anamorphic transfer, and the audio track are a VERY noticable improvement over the first edition. 2. MGM has admirably avoided the usual trick of jacking up the list price-it is the same as the first edition (let's hope this signals a new trend in the industry!). As for the film itself-fellow reviewers have already done a fine job of plot synopsis; just suffice it to say that this one fits snugly into your &quot;Conspiracy A-Go-Go&quot; section right next to &quot;The Parallax View&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;The Conversation&quot; and &quot;Three Days Of The Condor&quot;. And you wanna see something REALLY scary? When &quot;Farenheit 9-11&quot; is released on DVD, try it on a double bill with &quot;Manchurian Candidate&quot;. Pleasant dreams!</p></body></html>

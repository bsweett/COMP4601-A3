<meta name="summary" content="The truth behind the Munich massacre revealed - 4 1/2*'s"></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg again strikes a raw nerve in his somber tribute to his Jewish heritage in "Munich". He recounts the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics by the Palestinian terror group Black September.  Using archived film clips from news reports of the terrorist attack he creates a graphic portrait of the horror generated by this event.  Using a clever cinematographic technique his color film appears to be more a colorized black and white, a washed out, toned down version of the vibrant color schemes seen in todays films.<br /><br />Eric Bana, previously seen playing Hector in "Troy" gives a career defining performance as low level Israeli Mossad agent Avner Kaufman.  Bana is recruited through the highest channels of Israeli government including prime minister Golda Meir to administer revenge for the Olympic attacks.  Bana is separated from his family and made head of a five man assassination team to execute 11 Palestinians identified as being responsible for the attacks.  He is officially made a non entity in Israel so that his actions can have deniability.<br /><br />Included in his team among others is Daniel Craig playing British accented Steve.  Bana is handled by his Mossad contact Ephraim played nicely by Geoffrey Rush.<br /><br />The plot lead us through the machinations Bana and his team have to go through to accomplish their mission.  They are assisted by a family of Frenchmen lead by the distinguished Michael Lonsdale who provide information for exorbitant fees as to the whereabouts for their targets.<br /><br />Spielberg presents a fairly unbiased view of these events also evoking sympathy for the Palestinian cause.  Bana's character in the film, Avner goes through a metamorphosis. his psyche ultimately in turmoil due to guilt and the paranoia of his position. He and his family leave Israel to settle in the U.S..  We realize that although he is beseeched by Rush to return to his homeland, things can never be the same for him there.</p></body></html>

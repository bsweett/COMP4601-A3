<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful, Intelligent Film"></head><body><p>This is a wonderful film for upper elementary/middle school students and up. Though it deals with imagination and fantasy it is definitely not a fantasy movie but a coming of age film that addresses the difficult subject of the sudden death of a young person.  I have to agree  with another poster that the young music teacher showed ridicuously poor judgement in taking Jess to the art museum without any other people present but do not let that spoil this wonderful movie for you.  The two young actors playing Jess and Leslie are amazing and the whole thing is well acted and beautifully executed.</p></body></html>

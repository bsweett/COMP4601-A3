<meta name="summary" content="POOR DVD package, film better than expected"></head><body><p>OK, I had my doubts about this film.<br /><br />I will STILL watch the 1951 Disney classic above  this one.<br /><br />I had doubts when "Pocahontas" was released in 1995.  Turned out to be a great film.<br /><br />This film is good NOT GREAT.  I have never read the Lewis Carroll book, just know the 1951 film.<br /><br />Of course, we do NOT have songs in this 1.  You can always listen to the songs in the 1951 film.<br /><br />Depp, he has done this type of role before, so this was no stretch for him.  Carter, Burton's girlfriend so that is how she keeps getting these parts in his film, good as the Red Queen.  The big head bit....with special effects the way the are today this effect should have been done better.  Hathaway needs Disney to get hit films.  OK job as the White Queen with no screen time till 2cd half of film.<br /><br />Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum were a let down compared to the 1951 film.  All the animated characters NOT even close to the classic film.<br /><br />The ending was bit of a let down.<br /><br />NOW, I find myself having to say this with recent Disney DVD releases.<br />A line on the back of this DVD case describing the film "The extraordinary characters you've loved come to life richer and MORE COLORFUL THAN EVER".  OK, Disney, if you are prompting how the film looks then why are you guys resorting to PLAIN SILVER DVD' LIKE WHEN DVD'S CAME OUT IN THE LATE 1990'S?<br /><br />No chapter search list or any information on film inside.<br /><br />Disney has gone CHEAP & I just hate this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Total Recall - One of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best films!"></head><body><p>"Total Recall" is, quite simply, one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best action flicks and quite obviously, one of the ones that helped build his super star status at the time of its release.  When this outstanding Sci-Fi action/thriller was released, it was right in the middle of Arnold Schwarzenegger's run of films where he could seemingly do no wrong.  After watching the "Imagining Total Recall" documentary, it's even more surprising to find out that the original director wasn't Paul Verhoeven and the original Douglas Quaid wasn't to be Arny but Patrick Swayze; now that would've been an almost entirely different movie.  Despite the exceptional script, I doubt Patrick Swayze would've garnered the attention that Arnold did for this memorable flick.<p>One of the most interesting aspects behind the script of this film is the overall theme behind it, was it "real" or was it Douglas Quaid's Total Rekall experience?  Another highly interesting aspect of this film is its supposed sequel which may have been scrapped for Arnold Schwarzenegger's bid for and election as the Governor of Kalifornia!  If you pull up the Cast and Crew Information under the Special Features section and click on Arnold's screen, you'll see a listing for Total Recall 2 (2002), something that obviously hasn't happened but who knows what will happen in the future!<p>Credit goes to Arnold for his performance in this film, which was an exceptional display in that his acting skills were only getting better and better; granted, he's not the best actor in the industry, but for his type of movies, he was at the top when this film was released.  Sharon Stone puts on a wonderful performance in this film and this film can most certainly be directly attributed to being the one that led to her super stardom and being cast for some of her bigger roles.  Ronny Cox also does another superior job of being the villain in this movie, a role he has always done well in.  For Star Trek Voyager fans, it's interesting to note that Robert Picardo does the voiceover for the Johnny Cab.<p>"Total Recall" is just another in a long list of outstanding and somewhat gory action flicks for director Paul Verhoeven.  In this genre, he can most certainly be counted among the best directors to ever take up the mantle.  Phillip K. Dick, the author of the short story "We Can Remember it for You Wholesale," the story that "Total Recall" is based upon, also wrote the story that "Blade Runner" was based upon and many more; just showing what a talent this writer has been.<p>The Premise:<p>Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) wakes up to find himself lying next to Lori (Sharon Stone), who he believes to have been his loving wife for the last eight years.  Quaid expresses that he wishes to go to Mars but Lori doesn't want anything to do with it.  As Quaid is coming home from work, he sees an advertisement for Total Rekall where he can take a virtual vacation and decides to try it.  Not long after his virtual vacation begins, this action flick takes off on a breathtaking wild ride that doesn't slow down until the credits start rolling...<p>I highly recommend this film to any and all who're interested in seeing one of the best Sci-Fi action movies ever made.  One note of caution though, this film is not for the young, faint of heart or weak of stomach as is the norm with a Paul Verhoeven film.  To achieve the film he's looking for, he doesn't spare the gore at all!  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-Audio Commentary with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Director Paul Verhoeven<br />-"Imagining Total Recall" Documentary<br />-Rekall's Virtual Vacations<br />-"Visions of Mars" Featurette (This is especially interesting considering we have a rover on Mars right now)<br />-Visual Storyboard Comparisons<br />-Conceptual Art<br />-Photo Gallery<br />-Production Notes<br />-Theatrical Trailers and TV Spots<br />-Cast and Crew Information</p></body></html>

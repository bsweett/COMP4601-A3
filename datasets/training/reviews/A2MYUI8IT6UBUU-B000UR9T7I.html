<meta name="summary" content="Spider Man 3 Movie Review"></head><body><p>In the final chapter of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, we find Peter Parker finally reaching a fulfilling equilibrium between his normal life and his crime-fighting one, as he readies a proposal to childhood sweetheart Mary Jane. But such serenity is not meant to last, and our masked hero is attacked by foes both old and new. Parker's best friend Harry has again risen to avenge his father, a man made of sand terrorizes New York, and a gooey symbiotic life-form threatens to destroy Spider-Man entirely. With plenty of fantastical action, a heart-wrenching storyline complete with love and revenge, the funniest Bruce Campbell cameo ever, and a special effects-laden final showdown the magnitude of which hasn't been witnessed before, Spider-Man 3 may be the best installment yet.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 is undeniably an entertaining film. But Sam Raimi, perhaps pressured by the huge fan base or studio executives, has tried to cram too much into the third chapter of this hugely popular franchise. One of Spider-Man's best designed and admired comic book villains, Venom, makes his big screen debut, but it feels awfully small. Focusing mainly on New Goblin and the Sandman, Venom is left to relish in only the last half of the film. His design is greatly lacking from the enormously muscular and grotesque look of the comics. His large teeth-laden mouth and flicking snake-like tongue are drastically toned down and instead he is equipped with a high-pitched shriek. While Topher Grace's acting is adequate, his scrawny stature just doesn't seem to fit with how Venom has been drawn for so many years. The character development for this character is greatly stunted, and by the time Eddie Brock becomes Venom we don't really hate him and his motives against Spidey seem somewhat trivial.<br /><br />On the bright side, Sandman is an astonishing villain to behold and his human side is developed with much more care. Thomas Haden Church portrays Flint Marko with a tender demeanor and an honesty that makes you believe he's merely a victim of circumstance. The premise that leads to Marko becoming a powerful manipulator of sand is a bit hokey, but relatively accurate to his comic book origins. Spider-Man even comments: "where do these guys come from?" The special effects are flat out jaw-dropping. The realistic particle effects and transformations of dirt and mud forming into Church's statuesque face are unbelievably impressive and toward the conclusion when Sandman becomes a giant monstrosity of earth and cement, his roar of utter awesomeness echoes his appearance.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 does contain the most involved and complex love story of the three, and is a perfect culmination of all the loose ends and various plotlines started in the first two films. The story arc of Harry Osborn and his demented alter ego finally concludes and Spider-Man must try once and for all to mend their fragile friendship. Mary Jane and Peter plan to marry but jealousy and misunderstandings constantly impede their struggling love, and the appearance of Gwen Stacy (the gorgeous blonde Bryce Dallas Howard) further complicates their already murky love affair.<br /><br />Raimi divides the suspense in a few key spots with some truly inspired and outrageous dance numbers. Tobey throws around a few riotously funny moves after Venom's poison takes effect, giving him a cocky self-confidence and the desire to appear a bit "emo". These bits of humor perfectly supplement the tone and help ease the breakneck pacing of the film's action. And let's not forget Bruce Campbell's signature cameo, which easily outdoes the other two in comedic value.<br /><br />With near perfect special effects, interesting new characters, and an intensely complex storyline that converges and concludes every plot point and loose end from its predecessors, Spider-Man 3 is both a fitting finale and colossal blockbuster no Spidey fan should dare miss. Again shattering the myth that sequels can't be better than the original, this final chapter in the Spider-Man trilogy sends off our web-slinging superhero with an adventure befitting the expectations the legion of loyal fans hold for the series.<br /><br />-The Massie Twins</p></body></html>

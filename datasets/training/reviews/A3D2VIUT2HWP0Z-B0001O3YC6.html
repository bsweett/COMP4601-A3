Not even if you compare them to the re-edits that come out in Quadrilogy.<br /><br />Anyways, the film is quick to start, and races at a great pace. Don't be fooled by the reviews panning Vin's work ... he does a great job, and conveys a superb feeling as the hero ( or "anti-hero" if you wish).<br /><br />As it is, the film is a great watch. If only some of the stylistic film stock changes could be reversed ...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Franchise spotlight  Die Hard 9/10"></head><body><p>If there's action star I've not mentioned it would be Bruce Wills I've loved this movie since 96 or 97 Die Hard is an action classic that stars Bruce Wills as New York City Cop John McClane Bonnie Belinda stars as Holly Genero McClane his wife & Reginald Vel Johnson as LA cop Sargent Al Powell. The Plot is straight forward & brilliant at the same time. John McClane is going to see Holly cause she accepted a job there which has a lot of h?** in the marriage. So there's a party going on at the Nakitomi towers where Holly works at some Terrorist's led by Hans Gruber & they really crash the party take some hostages & send The Police & FBI on a wild goose chase making them think it's about political prisoners. Meanwhile John doesn't go in guns ablazing he outsmarts them taking them out 1 by 1. I like how the characters are developed the fight scenes are great effects are too as is the stunt work. Some cool facts Bruce Wills & Demi Moore got marred during filming. Richard Gere was considered for the role of McClane that would have been terrible so was Richard Dean Anderson & Don Johnson. So was Burt Reynolds seriously!? This was also planned to be Commando 2. Ok Die Hard is a great movie if you don't have it don't rent if buy it & put it in your collection.</p></body></html>

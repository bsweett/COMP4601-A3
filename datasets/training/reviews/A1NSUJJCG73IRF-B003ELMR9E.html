<meta name="summary" content="Insomnia (2002)"></head><body><p>Director:  Christopher Nolan.<br />Cast:  Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hillary Swank, Maura Tierney, Martin Donovan, Nicky Katt.<br />Running Time:  118 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.<p>As if Hitchcock woke from the dead and decided to make one last film so his soul could finally rest, he would have made a film very similar to &quot;Insomnia&quot;.  Although Christopher Nolan is certainly no Hitchcock, this intense suspense-thriller possesses the some of the qualities that make a true classic.  The story winds through the nightless town of Nightmute, Alaska, where LAPD detective Will Dormer (played by Al Pacino is an only par performance) investigates a troubling serial killer case.  When the investigation takes a sudden, twisting turn, Dormer not only is in pursuit of a killer, but is up against the sleepless psychological trauma that is disrupting his every move.<p>As Dormer gets closer and closer to the truth, he comes across a startlingly eerie author (Robin Williams), who happens to have vital information about concerning one of the victim's death.  As Dormer becomes more involved with the author, his paranoia grows increasingly unstable.  Williams steals the show throughout the second half of the film, portraying the role with ease; a haunting character that must have crept mightily out of his soul.  Hillary Swank is a some-what misused rookie officer who is one step behind Dormer in solving the case and her peformance is only fair.<p>Director Nolan uses the excellent Hilary Seitz to his advantage, plotting Dormer's fears and ambitions, tooling Pacino and Williams's characters in a battle of good and evil, yet the good and the evil are presented in an enigmatic, vague fashion that will keep viewers guessing.  Entertaining, thrilling, and moderately scary--Hitchcock would have been pretty proud.</p></body></html>

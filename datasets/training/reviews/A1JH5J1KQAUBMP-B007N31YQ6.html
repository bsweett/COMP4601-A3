Though not in the same league as a great film like the similarly-themed "Silkwood," I found this to be an entertaining and satisfying tale of the little guy triumphing against the system.  Roberts is very good as a tough, tired, disappointed woman who flaunts what she sees as her only asset--her physical beauty.  Albert Finney fleshes out the underwritten role of Brockovich's boss, Ed Masry.  The character of George, however, is a misstep.  He is some kind of working woman's fantasy man--a tough, good-looking biker who is also sensitive, domestic, and good with kids.  He comes across as a blatant plot device--a convenient way to show that Brockovich's kids are being cared for while she works overtime as well as provide a love interest whose only real purpose is to be neglected so we can see the impact of her job on her personal life.  Aaron Eckhardt never really figures out what to do with the part.  Nevertheless, it's an entertaining film.</p></body></html>

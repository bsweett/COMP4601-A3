<meta name="summary" content="A truly awesome film"></head><body><p>If there's anything in this world that interests me less than boxing, I don't know what it is. Plus, this movie is burdened with a very stupid name. But it's a Clint Eastwood film about a female boxer, played by Hilary Swank, which received rave reviews from a large number of my Advanced English Writing students back in China. I bought this maybe two years ago, or maybe even longer ago than that. Finally, I watched it.<br /><br />First thought. Clint has the ability to portray so much with an economy of effort that you can forget he's a damn fine actor.<br /><br />Macho philosophy in quotable bite-sized nuggets. Okay, we have those.<br /><br />Understated humor. Yep, got that.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood as a gruff misfit who's really a soft touch. Yep, got that.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman as the sidekick you wish you had. Yep, got that.<br /><br />Whenever something really interests Clint as a movie maker, he will make you see why. We have an analysis of boxing that makes me say, "Welcome to the gym." You feel it on a level where words fail to express it. I almost understand why people are interested in participating. Almost. Why people watch a damn bloodsport will always remain beyond me.<br /><br />And then, even though I knew from my students' writing that this was going to wind up raising the question of euthanasia, and that Clint shares my sentiments about it, I was wholly unprepared for the way it broke my heart. This has got to be the saddest movie I've seen in... well, maybe ever. If it doesn't break your heart, you don't have one.<br /><br />It deserves every award it won or was nominated for, and I'm glad I saw it once. I don't think I've got the guts to see it twice, which surely means boxing isn't for me. Are you ready for some football?</p></body></html>

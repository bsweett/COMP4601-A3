<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining fright feast!"></head><body><p>Two young adults ( Gina Philips and Justin Long) are driving their way through a sunny day on springbreak week until they witness a house that has a strange person dumping a body down a pipe. They get suspicious as they investigate that hole on what that odd person dumped down there, it appears to be a body but also a collection of stitch taxidermies made of human bodies. They head out to a local town to contact the cops, but soon the odd man from the house who has the bodies begins to stalk the two and cannot be stopped until the two are dead as he is really a monster.<br /><br />Entertaining and quite different horror thriller that harkons back to the 70's horror movies of it's era, there is some decent acting, fine gore and scares to go with it. The opening sequence is quite terrifying and it's twist ending is definitely disturbing as well, i think it's the one of the better horror offerings in recent memory.<br /><br />The Special Edition DVD is very cool! an informative audio commentary by the director, crisp picture & Sound, Deleted & extended scenes especially an alternate ending, featurettes, Photo gallery, and Trailer.<br /><br />Also recommended: House of 1000 Corpses, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974 and 2003), Re-Animator, Final Destination 1 & 2, From Dusk Till Dawn, Demons, Friday The 13th series, Nightmare on Elm Street series, Stephen King's IT, The Shining, Cannibal Holocaust, City of the Living Dead ( a.k.a.

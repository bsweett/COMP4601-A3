<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic Special Effects...Pity About the Plot"></head><body><p>There has perhaps been no other film that has the quality of special effects as seen in "The Day After Tomorrow".  The vision of tornados venting destruction upon Los Angeles or monumental floods seeping across New York City are truly spectacular.  Few will forget the scene of a cargo ship floating aimlessly down a flooded Manhattan street until it is stopped below the surface by the debris of wrecked cars and buses.<p> Yet films cannot rely upon special effects alone.  Indeed, it is on this point that the film fails.  The plot is flimsy at best.  The "facts" are so implausible as to be ridiculous.  It would take a particularly gullible mind to accept that the world's climate can change to a monumental degree in just a few days.  However, it is this line that the film's makers want us to believe!<p>I must state now that I am no greenie so there may be some who claim my views are jaundiced.  Be this at may, the film's undertone is very preachy.  If only we stopped using cars and so forth and the world could be saved.  Oh really!  Take a reality check!<p>In spite of my criticisms, the film is worth seeing...but only just.  Special effects can only take a film so far.  At some point, plot and acting ability must raise its head.  Unfortunately, this film never quite reaches that point.</p></body></html>

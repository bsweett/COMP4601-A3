<meta name="summary" content=""The Core" Review!"></head><body><p>It seems like every summer, the world is about to be destroyed by a disaster of epic preportions and the plots seem to get more ridicilous every year. If you sat through Michael Bay's "Armageddon" in 1998 then you've probably seen this one before. This time, trade an asteroid the size of Texas for a whole bunch of solar storms that are being caused by a top-secret government project that has caused the planet's core to stop rotating. The Earth's only hope is a mixed bag of geophysiscists, astronauts, and other super-nerds who plan to drill into the Earth and restart the core with a bunch of nuclear weapons.<br /><br />The script from "Core" seems like it was ripped right out of Michael Bay's recycle bin. We've got all these picture perfect know-it-alls who seem to be both smarter and more clever than their government counterparts. We've got countless CGI disaster sequences. Hell, they even shamelessly steal the "drawing straws" concept from "Armageddon" as well. Unfortunately, it never manages to "borrow" the most appealing aspect of a Bay film which is the over-the-top honky tonk melodrama. Jon Amiel uses his share of big special effects pieces but it all seems more for show than anything else. Maybe it's the fact that I've been treated to more apocalyptic disaster films than I can count on two hands but "Core" just seemed far too predictable. The sense of dread that comes with an "end of the world" event like this seems noticeably absent.<br /><br />"The Core" is more of the same generic junk food that Hollywood loves to recycle. If you still haven't had your fix of disaster movies with overqualified ensemble casts then by all means, give this one a whirl. It makes "Armageddon" and "Volcano" look like National Geographic specials in comparisson.</p></body></html>

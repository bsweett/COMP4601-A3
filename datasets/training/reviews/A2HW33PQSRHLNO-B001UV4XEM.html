<meta name="summary" content=""She only hit me once, and I was out of line.""></head><body><p>Director Todd Phillips has done that rarest of things with this film--made an actually hilarious comedy, not one that is a corny embarrassment to both oneself and the people around them.  Example:(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG97XI">Hot Tub Time Machine</a>.<br /><br />Four guys--Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper), Ed Helms (Stu Price), Zach Galifianakis (Alan Garner in an eccentric turn of brilliance as a sage-like manchild), and soon-to-be-married Doug Billings (Justin Bartha) decide to hit Vegas and have a wild time before their friend gets hitched. Not before encountering a very angry Mike Tyson, a sociopathic gay Chinese gangster, and a bunch of Indian guys who run a compromised church for intoxicated men looking to get "married".<br /><br />Nearly every turn of dialogue in this movie is an exercise in self or-other deprecating black humor punctuated by strange moments of compassion.  If he works it right, Phillips could be the future of contemporary comedy.  There is a sequel in the works.  This just about hits the mark of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAV">Kids in the Hall - Brain Candy</a> and of course <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04L0">Office Space - Special Edition with Flair (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  Not just recommended, this is a MUST SEE.<br /><br />(I've heard rumors that actor Bradley Cooper is going to star in a remake of "The Crow".  I sure hope that's not true, disrespectful as that would be to Brandon Lee's memory.)</p></body></html>

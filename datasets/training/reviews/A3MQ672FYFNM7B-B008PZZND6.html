<meta name="summary" content="It's still an awesome movie"></head><body><p>I don't really care about bonuses or extra scenes, especially when the picture is top notch like "Brokeback Mountain." The movie was really awesome because it is such a beautiful tale of love and loss between two very complicated men (Heath Ledger played Ennis Del Mar, and Jake Gyllenhaal played Jack Twist. There has not been a love story (released in the US) in the past thirty years that compares to "Brokeback Mountain." Anyone that appreciates classic cinema will totally enjoy "Brokeback Mountain" because it is emotional, heartfelt, and very thought-provoking. It's like watching The Titanic, " "The Wizard of Oz" and, "Johnny Guitar" all rolled into one picture, but even better.</p></body></html>

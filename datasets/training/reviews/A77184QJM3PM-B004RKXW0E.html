The first two films were funny, endearing, and original masterpieces, and I could only hope and pray that A. they would make a third, and that B. it would be at least half as good as the first two. Well bless those geniuses at Pixar, they went for a third movie with our favs from the toy box, and they gave us a film that can proudly stand alongside the first two. Some of the original toys are missing in this one, and a moment near the beginning settles the fate of those missing toys, but the main characters are here, and most of them are freaking now that Andy is about to start college. Gloom, doom and despair, they're headed for the attic, or worse, the land-fill. Due to a mix-up, the toys find themsleves donated to a day-care, which is what you would think that toys would consider heaven. It turns out to be just the opposite, and that's when the interesting stuff really starts. The pace is kept tight, with only a slight drag here and there, with lots of adult nods and winks, and laughs galore. The animation is superb, as is usual with Pixar. I am of the very firm opinion that Pixar is the real and true home of the computer animated film, and all others are just wanna-bees ( yes, even the Shrek series). How Pixar continues to turn out quality film after quality film each and every time is amazing. As I said, the pace is good, and gets more intense towards the end. Actually, I noted several people squirmed a bit in a key part in the land-fill, so the intensity was a bit surprising. However, the ending was pure magic. There is a fine line between heavy-handed sentimentality and pulling the heart strings enough to get a reaction, and Pixar has it down pat. The ending is just right, and leaves the door open for a possible fourth film (which would be GREAT). All in all, this movie kind of surprised me. I knew I'd like it, but it was better than it had to be. That's another thing Pixar is good at.</p></body></html>

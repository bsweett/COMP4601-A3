This perfomance is, I think, his best. But, this is no action-packed, thrill-a-minute movie.  In fact is is sometimes dull and really quite depressing.  In fact, I think the film lets smith down as it becomes a bit clunky as it goes on.  Otherwise, he would have been considered award worthy.  And that german shepherd - wow!</p></body></html>

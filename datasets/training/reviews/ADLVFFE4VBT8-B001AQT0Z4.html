<meta name="summary" content="Blu release - significantly improved video, spectacular sound, poor packaging"></head><body><p>Pulp Fiction, besides (arguably) being the best Tarantino movie so far, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068DBC">Pulp Fiction (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> was/is one of the best packaged DVDs ever. I didn't hesitate for one second when I noticed that the poorly packaged Blu edition was selling for about eight dollars. I placed the order, the plan being to simply replace the DVD's movie disc with the Blu and get the best of both.<br /><br />It was a gamble because not all Blu re-issues are noticeable improvements over the original DVD releases but this edition of Pulp Fiction is. Very much so. Anyone who's watched the Blu issues of '2001' or the Blu James Bond Collection or The Godfather probably knows what I'm talking about. Its like someone washed the camera's lens and everything that was to be sharp is even more so and all shades are nuances are now perfectly rendered. Add to that the spectacular Loseless DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio soundtrack and, especially at this price, the Blu Pulp Fiction should be a must buy.<br /><br />As for the extra content, this one-disc release carries almost everything (DVD resolution) that the Collector's edition has, minus the DVD-ROM features and adds 2 new featurettes containing more recent interviews with the cast and some critics discussion on the movie's role in the history of cinematography.<br /><br />The presentation is in line with this edition price: done cheaply: cheap looking blue plastic case with cutouts to reduce the costs by a couple of pennies and... nothing else. But, again, my intention was from the beginning to take the Blu disc and place it in the beautiful DVD case.<br /><br />I am happy with my purchase.</p></body></html>

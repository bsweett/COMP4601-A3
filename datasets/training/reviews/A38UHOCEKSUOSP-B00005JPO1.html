Indiana Jones is certainly one of my all-time favorites, and I had been looking forward to ths 4th installment since the news was released years ago it was in works and even cancelled for some time (boy was I dissapointed).  I was too thrilled when I learned about its come back and I knew with Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford on the project it had to be a winner.  Funny thing is, it never felt quite like what I expected out of these guys.<br /><br />Ok, so Ford is older and just wasn't the same.  But he really was not bad either, in fact he held up pretty well in some of the action scenes (and he did do a few stunts himself).  Karen Allen is definelty a returning treat as well, who was always my favorite of the three original Jones ladies.  Shia Lebouf, surprisingly, made a stronger impact than I thought possible (though Im not sure I can see him taking over the role of Indiana Jones as has been rumored for a sequal).  Cate Blanchet, despite being an excellent actress, never stole the show as a memorable villain.  She definelty has a few strong scenes (mainly her sword fighting in the jeep chase scene) but her part never came close in comparison to previous Jones villains.<br /><br />The story suffered a bit I thought.  Though I appreciate that once again the Crystal skulls artificats are real world artifcats that contain mysterious powers, the plot got a little carried away on this one I thought.  Now I won't give away the ending (though I'm sure one way or another the secret is already out) but it just didn't fit into the Indiana Jones realm in my humble opinion.  However, the adventure, action, laughs and thrills are all there along the way, with some scenes (the beginning warehouse scene and the jeep chase) brining some Raiders nostalgia back.  Things do slow down quite a bit and get a bit boring about mid-way through, but overall its a fun ride.<br /><br />Kingdom of the Crystal Skull surpasses Temple of Doom, but that's about it.  This one is nowhere as good as Raiders or Last Crusade, but that was kind of to be expected.  Considering its almost 20 years since the last film, there is more good to this one than bad.  Fans will enjoy it and should see this, but it will leave you with a bit of a bitter taste in the end.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 3<br />Overall - 4</p></body></html>

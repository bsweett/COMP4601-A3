<meta name="summary" content=""The Greatest Horror Film of All-Time!""></head><body><p>"The Exorcist" came out on Boxing Day, 1973 and immediately became a boxoffice phenomenon. Highly regarded by critics and fans as the best thriller ever made, "The Exorcist" tells of a true story in which a 12 year old girl is possessed by satan. The movie is also one of the best movies ever made, with amazing performances by all the leads, especially Ellen Burstyn who plays the mother, and Linda Blair who plays the little girl. The movie also won 2 Oscars, one for sound and the other for the screenplay. I also believe both Burstyn and Blair were robbed of Academy Awards for their roles, as some had a hard time with the posession that took place in the story. The movie is about the forces of good and evil in the world and the eventual outcome of that battle. There have also been other sequels and pre-quels to "The Exorcist", but they are all inferior to the original. The follow up "The Exorcist 2" is regarded as one of the worst films ever, although Linda Blair is in it. Ellen Burstyn refused to be a part of it as she felt the script was awful.<br /> This DVD release also features 11 minutes of extra scenes that were omitted from the original release, which also contains the horrifying "spider walk" sequence.<br /> Not appearing on this disc, unfortunately, is the amazing BBC documentary on the making of "The Exorcist", that was featured on the 1998 25th Anniversary Edition of the movie. If you can find that edition grab it as the documentary is informative and interesting.<br /> Also, Ellen Burstyn's autobiography called "Lessons In Becoming Myself" is a wonderful read and she goes into detail on how she got the role of Chris McNeil and the trouble the cast and crew found themselves in while making it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Forget about camera angles... It's just boring !"></head><body><p>THis is one of the worst movies I've ever watched. It doesn't matter if it has new camera angles, new techniques. The plot is plain horrible, the narrative is boring, lazy and slow. I can't figure out why the so-called  critics say this is &quot;the best movie of all times&quot; ! They must be  joking! The dialogues are terrible, acting is poor, image is old.I prefer  Chaplin !</p></body></html>

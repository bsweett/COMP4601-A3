<meta name="summary" content="Witty Thriller"></head><body><p>Inside Man is a Spike Lee directed "Joint" starring academy award winners Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster as well as academy award nominee Christopher Plummer.<br /><br />This is a story of a successful bankrobbery by a wiley criminal (Clive Owen) and a New York Police negotiator, Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington). The robbers are always one move ahead of the Police Department and keep control of the situation. Not only have they taken over the entire bank, they have about 30 hostages to bargain with. It is a tense situation, and the robbers have the power. During the negotiations the bank chair (Christopher Plummer) brings in Madeline White (Jodie Foster), a tough, cold, yet pleasant power broker.  He needs her discretion to get something out of his safety deposit box to save his reputation. She has connections with the Mayor and asks him for access.  He owes her a favor so she is allowed to meet with the robbers in person to present a "deal".  After she leaves, Detective Frazier also talks to the head of the heist and threatens him.  Before Frazier leaves the robber says "I will walk out of here".<br /><br />As Detective Frazier continues negotiations there are flashbacks of hostage interviews  (so we know they are saved at the end) and witty scenes where the robbers are ordering pizza for hungry hostages.<br /><br />Overall the movie is an energetic, witty, enjoyable thriller that weaves throughout Spike Lee's familiar touching on race, power and class issues.</p></body></html>

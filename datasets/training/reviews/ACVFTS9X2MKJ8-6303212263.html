<meta name="summary" content="It's really no great improvement over the standard DVD, in fact, I'm rather more partial to my regular DVD of the film"></head><body><p>Today, I bought my first Blu-Ray disc player.  And the first of my 22 Blu-Ray discs that I already bought that I played today was this movie of "Superman: The Movie."<br /><br />Well, I just watched this Blu-Ray version of "Superman: The Movie", and then watched my old DVD of this film.  I'll have to say that buying the Blu-Ray disc of this movie proved to be a waste of money.  The Blu-Ray disc looks no better than the DVD.  In fact, I'll even say that the DVD had it's colors more in check than this Blu-Ray disc did.  On Blu-Ray, the flesh tones were rather too pink where on regular DVD, everyone's flesh tones looked more natural.  So, for this being my first Blu-Ray disc to watch and compare, I'm rather disappointed, but then again, greatly relieved.  Perhaps I won't bother buying Blu-Ray disc replacements for the DVD's that I already have and believe look quite good as the standard DVD's that they are.  I really do think that Blu-Ray is getting far more hype than they're really worth.</p></body></html>

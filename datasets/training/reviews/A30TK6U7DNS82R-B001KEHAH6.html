He's extremely skilled with actors, and I remember him way back when making a little movie with Michael Imperioli, the fellow who plays Christopher on The Sopranos, and Mira Sorvino from ROMY AND MICHELLE's HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.  In addition I believe his previous films featured the very last screen appearances of both Gregory Hines and George Plimpton, so you know he's used to working with the best.  Most of all, we remember Gary Winick for making TADPOLE, which if you remember was all about a very young boy who wanted to date a 40 year old woman, and how our bodies are wired to pick up romantic signals from even the most unlikely people.  Winick finds a sweet brand of comedy from all this, and you can see it in the might-have-been troubling scene in 13 GOING ON 30 in which Jennifer Garner goes over to pick up a 13 year old boy in a restaurant and is only stopped when Judy Greer tells her, "Do you want to go to jail!"<br /><br />Both Garner and Greer make great impressions.  Garner is all over the place with her acting, but most of the time she successfully channels an adorable young girl.  The scene where she sings LOVE IS A BATTLEFIELD at a slumber party is worth the price of admission, and you'll like the end credits in which the slumber party girls' singing is mixed into Pat Benatar's robust MTV version of the number.  Judy Greer has a difficult part to play too.  Everyone loved her on TV, playing Kitty on ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, Jason Bateman's secretary who despises him, and she is lovely here and you can see how she has a great future playing the girl you love to hate.<br /><br />But most of all you will come out of this fantasy feeling a little bit better about yourself and about the choices you have made and have yet to make.</p></body></html>

The twist is that neither of them knows of the secret life of the other. This complicated their lives (imagine the lies that each must tell the other) but also puts a strain on their marriage. Their day lives are vastly more exciting than their very polite and very perfunctory after-hours existence.<br /><br />This tension and complexity makes the first half of the movie fun and unpredictable. But as soon as the assassins learn of each others' identity, the movie bogs down into a standard shoot-em-up with lots of acrobatics, close calls, impossible escapes, big guns and loud explosions.<br /><br />The extras include somewhat interesting material about problems encountered during shooting, including a couple of "mistakes" (Pitt running into the wrong section of a breakaway fence) that made it into the film.<br /><br />Still, the writing in the second half could have been less predictable. Too bad. The first half had so much going for it.</p></body></html>

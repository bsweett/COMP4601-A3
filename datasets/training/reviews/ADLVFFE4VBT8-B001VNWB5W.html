I do :)<br /><br />Watching Watchmen - it was a different experience for someone like me who never heard of them until the movie, probably because I live on a 'third' thread of reality, different from Watchers' own and what most people view as 'ours'. But this is not not scope of my review. Hundreds have been posted, discussing meaning, content and artistic skills. I will focus on the Blu-ray release because it's difficult to find a Blu-specific reviews when the DVD and Blu editions reviews are bundled together even though they are distinct products.<br /><br />_________________________________________________________<br /><br />Common content:<br />==============<br /><br />This version of the movie is labeled 'Director's cut' It's 186 minutes in length which adds 24 minutes to the theatrical version.<br /><br />There are several extras that, in the Blu version come on 1080P resolution, 2-channel stereo. The common 'extras' include:<br /><br />- The Phenomenon: The Comic That Changed Comics - the Original Graphics Novel's Groundbreaking Impact. The actors, writers, DC Comics people discuss the Watchmen, their meaning and their impact in the world of comics. About 30 minutes.<br /><br />- Real Heroes, Real Vigilantes: a marginally interesting discussion of the meaning of vigilantism complete with advice from experts (don't do it) with some focus on New York's Guardian Angles featuring Curtis Sliwa and the case of Bernhard Goetz, the New Yorker who shot 4 attackers in the subway back in 1985.<br /><br />- Mechanics: Technologies of a Fantastic World. A professor comments on whether the Watchmen's gadgets and Dr. Manhattan were possible in our 'real' world. 16 minutes.<br /><br />- My Chemical Romance Desolation Row Music Video - a very energetic music video.<br /><br />The digital copy disc - which WILL expire in July 2010 - is common to both editions. They are meant to be run on a PC or a Mac (needs iTunes 7.7 or later). I don't believe they could run on an Xbox, PS3 or PSP.<br /><br />On release date, Amazon emailed me a link that would have allowed me to download the movie and watch it on my PC but I was out on vacation at the time and by the time I was back home the actual movie on disc was delivered. I don't know the current orders would get the same treatment.<br /><br />Blu-ray specific:<br />================<br /><br />Video: 1080P<br />Audio: DTS-HD Master Audio (English), Dolby Digital surround (French)<br /><br />Maximum Movie Mode with Zack Snyder<br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />This is where Warner Bros., not known for putting a lot of extra effort into their BD editions threw everything and the kitchen sink at us, trying to take full advantage of Blu's capabilities.<br /><br />The Maximum Movie Mode (3M or MMM?) is watching the movie with Zack and a bunch of other people involved in the making of the movie cut in inside a PIP window and discuss or explain various topics ranging from personal views and what the movie meant to them and should mean to us to 'how we made this' talk.<br /><br />When Zack is on, he appears in the foreground while the movie continues to run inside a window and additional windows displaying related material run in parallel behind Zack's back.<br /><br />But this is only the beginning. On and off, while the movie is running, little windows pop up to show us:<br /><br />- Stacks of storyboard sketches synchronized to the movie scene.<br />- Frames from the original Watchmen graphic novel showing how faithful the movie makers were to the original content.<br /><br />Several dozen 'Press enter now' prompts will stop the movie to allow for<br /><br />- Browsing through content-related galleries of 'stills' each stack with its own background music<br />- Viewing 3-4 minute long featurettes on various topics. The featurettes can be accessed individually from the Menu.<br /><br />Of course, the MMM can't replace actually watching the movie because, half of the time, the soundtrack volume is lowered to allow for Zack or his associates to express their views and the picture is overlayed with the various visual inserts. Given the movie's length and the several dozen optional featurettes and galleries of stills, the 3+ hours could turn into double that. Having watched the movie once, I found it helpful to run the MMM at 1.5 speed. This cut the viewing time to a reasonable length and made watching the MMM worthwhile.<br /><br />BD Live<br />-------<br /><br />The ability to connect to the Net from the menu is a nice technological capability but it doesn't look like anyone was able to make good use of it yet. I did access the feature but I did not find the Net excursion to be time well spent.<br /><br />First of all, Warner wanted me to register: user ID, email address, 'strong' password. It's a process that's initiated from the movie menu and continues on one's PC after a confirmation email from Warner is received. Each studio would want their own registration/password/email, it seems. Pretty awkward.<br /><br />Once in, a Watchmen trailer began to run on a small 'screen inside the screen' - I've watched the movie already, thank you very much and having to wait for this feature to actually load was annoying.<br /><br />Warner's BD Live house for Watchmen allows for posting personal video comments on the movie. 4 were posted of which 3 had the word 'test' in their title. One of the 2 I watched had someone looking and sounding embarrassed for what he was doing. The other one was in German.<br /><br />In addition, it's possible to link 'something' to Facebook but I didn't find it worth pursuing.<br /><br />There is also a Warner Bros. 'store'.<br /><br />Blu-ray evaluation<br />------------------<br /><br />I understand that some don't see much of a difference between BD's 1080P resolution and DVDs or upconverted DVDs but I do. All my new movies are Blu-ray now because I prefer the better picture resoulution and soundtrack quality. This alone, make the Blu-ray product - enhanced image and sound - different to me.<br /><br />I found the Maximum Movie Mode a great addition to the package. The content was informative and the presentation was innovative. I was amazed that the main 'movie' disc had sufficient room to host a 3+ hour movie plus what appeared to be at least one extra hour of hi-res full screen video and all the little windows content.<br /><br />The BD Live I can live without it (see above) but, to be fair, no one that I know came up with a really interesting BD Live extension to a movie. It's unlikely that I will access it again.<br /><br />Overall, I will grant this WB's Blu-ray release 4.5 stars rounding up to 5 for quality, effort and innovation.</p></body></html>

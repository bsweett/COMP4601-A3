Now for the fortieth anniversary of this enchanting movie, it's been rereleased with a slew of bonus features -- and for lovers of this movie, it's worth every second.<br /><br />Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) have a tendency to drive their nannies crazy. So when their strict father (David Tomlinson) puts out a call for a new nanny, he's startled when only one woman comes -- and Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) answered the request letter his children gave him, which he threw away. Mary Poppins's magical talents and offbeat pals soon endear her to the kids, especially when they romp through a chalk painting and have tea parties on the ceiling.<br /><br />But things take a darker turn when Mr. Banks takes the children to the bank where he works (get it? Banks? Bank? Yeah, whatever). After the kids inadvertantly cause a riot, they are taken along by Mary Poppins' friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a goodhearted Cockney. And then things take an unexpected turn when Mr. Banks is in danger of losing his job, forcing him to realize what is really important in his life.<br /><br />Walt Disney (the man as well as the corporation) was at his peak when "Mary Poppins" debuted, starring rubbery comic Dick Van Dyke and Broadway star Julie Andrews. Even though the film was made forty years ago, the special effects and blend of animation and reality are remarkably fresh and undated -- from the cartoon foxhunt to the rival nannies being blown down the street by a strong wind. And the story is a timeless one -- family should come first.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the movie's more sober, melancholy second half makes it more palatable to adults. A spoonful of sugar may make the medicine go down, but you don't want too much sugar (ex. the cartoon chalk drawing, the goofy Uncle Albert who acts like he's on ecstacy) The fluff is toned down with the threat of unemployment and parental estrangement.<br /><br />What makes the bonus DVD worth getting? It seems to be mostly aimed at the target group (kids) rather than nostalgic adults -- there is a rather peculiar animated short, based on one of the Mary Poppins novels by the original author. There's also the "I Love to Laugh" game, which is basically answering questions to get Uncle Albert off the ceiling, a singalong, and a reconstructed concept-art song that was deleted from the final product, "Chimpanzoo."<br /><br />Fun for kids, but adults will skip right over to the audio commentary (Andrews and van Dyke) and historical reminiscing, which include a making-of featurette and a look at the musical creations in this film. A particular bonus is a reunion with Andrews, van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman around a piano -- it's just very relaxed, laid-back and well-made.<br /><br />One of the best things is that the entire film has been remastered. Half of "Mary Poppins'" charm is in the visuals and songs. So it's great to see the color and sound cleaned up and sharpened -- it has the slight fuzz of a film that needed a bit more work (or maybe that's my old TV), but overall the work is good.<br /><br />Forty years have passed, and "Mary Poppins'" charm is undiminished. So in celebration of that, the anniversary edition with all the bonus material is definitely worth getting.</p></body></html>

If the recorded version was great, of course the DVD was even better! I watched the special features and was intrigued by the comment about how all it really was was a shot of an apartment window, Jimmy Stewart reacting, a shot of an apartment window, Jimmy Stewart reacting, a shot of an apartment window, Jimmy Stewart reacting... etc. The film was so compelling I had actually never realized it was that simple!<br /><br />Of course, there was a little more to it than that, such as Grace Kelly climbing fire escapes, the little dog sniffing the flower bed, the scenes in Jeff's apartment, and the final scene. But for the most part, that's all it was. And you know a movie is excellent when it keeps your attention for that long when it's simple dialogue, seemingly simple shots, and relatively few special effects. It must have actually been very difficult to film. Jimmy Stewart was actually reacting to NOTHING. And yet, each reaction had to be subtly different. What a challenge!<br /><br />I remember watching the movie Disturbia a few years ago. I couldn't watch it without thinking of this movie. I don't know if they intended it to be an homage to Rear Window or not. But I do know that I might have liked Disturbia if only I had never seen Rear Window!</p></body></html>

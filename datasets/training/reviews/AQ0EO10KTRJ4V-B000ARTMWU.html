<meta name="summary" content="Does not live up to the hype"></head><body><p>This film was hyped everywhere as "the best horror movie of the year".<br /><br />Perhaps that is indeed an accurate statement if 2005 was a weak year for horror movies.<br /><br />As bad as Hollywood seems at times these days, it is still good to see the one business where the USA still leads the world is film-making.<br /><br />Most European films simply don't cut it, and this French film was worse yet.<br /><br />Yeah.. yeah.. there was some good gore scenes, but the "people stranded in the wood with a mad killer" plot basis is getting old and overdone.<br /><br />I suppose films must only be made by big city dwellers since they always portray the wilderness as a scary eerie place.<br /><br />Personally, I would rather spend the night in the woods with a psycho killer than walk down a back alley in New York or LA at 3:00 am in the bad section of town!<br /><br />It's hard to get worked up or too excited by horror films of this type.<br /><br />The key to a good horror movie is when you place yourself in the potential victim's shoes and realize it would be VERY hard to get yourself out of that situation.<br /><br />By contrast, horror movies get irritating fast when the story only continues due to the ineptness or stupidity of the main character.<br /><br />You know a horror film is missing the mark when your wife is picking up a book to read during the movie because she has gotten irritated at the movie after yelling at the screen 10 times... "Come on already just whack the slow fat redneck over the head and be done with it, that guy is not threatening... heck even I could kick HIS ass".<br /><br />When your wife is making those comments you can definatley tell the film-makers missed out on the scary part !!<br /><br />Now in the case of this movie, there was a "surprise" ending that may explain some of the above, but honestly as many reviewers on here commented, it seemed like an illogical "cheap shot" surprise ending thought up as a last minute rewrite...... kind of like those murder mysteries there you can't figure out who the murderer is (and for good reason), when at the end of the film they introduce some brand new character that was never part of the first 119 minutes of the movie.</p></body></html>

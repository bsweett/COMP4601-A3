In the DVD bonus commentaries, the actors and director take exception to the impression some people had that this movie must have been adapted from a stage play. They protest that, to the contrary, this movie is supremely cinematic.<br /><br />I DID think this material looked as if it might have been adapted from a stage play. But to me, that isn't a negative. You get the best of both worlds here. You get the personal immediacy of a play, without a clutter of special effects and extras. But unlike being at a play, you get a telling close-up of the actors' faces. And that's everything in this intense game of cat and mouse.<br /><br />The acting is gripping, although I think that Patrick Wilson looks a little too nice to be a sexual predator. Not that all predators have to look seedy and suspect. But Wilson lacks that glinting, concentrated quality that comes of having a hidden agenda in every encounter. However Ellen Page is brilliant as his intended teenage victim. She blazes with genius, both practical and philosophical, as she counters each one of the predator's self-justifying arguments in turn.<br /><br />The movie looses some logic towards the end. I don't see the inevitability of the end in the same way the characters do. But that's a relatively small flaw in a generally realistically noir film.<br /><br />Neither of the two bonus DVD commentaries is very good. Listening to them tends to detract from the impact of the movie you've just watched. The actors' commentary is slightly better than the writer's. However you probably do need to listen to at least one of these running commentaries in order to pick up on a key point in the movie's action. I, apparently like a lot of viewers, didn't realize a pivotal element in this interplay until it was explained in the commentaries.</p></body></html>

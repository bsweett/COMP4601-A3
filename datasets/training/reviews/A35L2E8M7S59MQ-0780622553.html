<meta name="summary" content="The city without light - the director's cut"></head><body><p>A $28 million budget art house film that features several actors who have now ascended the ranks of stardom beat The Matrix to the punch in presenting many on screen concepts that questioned what it is to be human.  Very underrated, constantly drifting on the edge of obscurity, Dark City is a magical film that transcends many levels of modern filmmaking with questions of human nature and interactions.<br /><br />The story follows John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) who wakes up in a bath tub at the scene of a murder where he soon finds himself pursued by a mysterious group of black clad, pale fleshed men lead by Richard O'Brien (you may know him as the creator, writer, and co-star of the midnight screened, all-time cult favorite musical The Rocky Horror Picture Show) and John must receive aid from a man claiming to be his doctor (TV's 24 star Kiefer Sutherland). Discovering that the black-clad men (referred to as Strangers) control all that is within the city it is up to John to discover the secret of the city, the Strangers, and why the city never sees daylight. To do this he must discover the location of Shell Beach; the place everyone knows about, but no one seems to remember the directors to.  In the process he'll have to face the strangers, discover the secret to the eternal night, and the true extent of the Stranger's plans for the inhabitants...then he must find the strength hidden within him to free everyone from the stranger's hold.<br /><br />Dark City has over the past 11 years become a cult-favorite, starring actors who have risen in status in recent years, starring film-cult-figure Richard O'Brien, and being the immediate follow-up of director Alex Proyas' critically acclaimed adaptation of The Crow (which starred the late Brandon Lee who died from a technical accident during filming) and Proyas continues to dazzle with low-budget visual flair in this film-noir masterpiece that earned the title of being Roger Ebert's top film of 1998. Alex Proyas may be used as a corporate tool now, having his style severely cut back by studio control (see: I'Robot, and Knowing, both of which are severely different than Proyas' original ideas) but Dark City remains a great film that shows what a dedicated director can do with limited budget and limitless imagination.<br /><br />DVD to watch: I strongly recommend the director's cut over the theatrical cut, not so much because of content, but because the pacing of the director's cut is infinitely superior to that of the theatrical cut.<br /><br />The director's cut DVD also comes with commentary tracks by director Proyas and film critic Roger Ebert (essentially the last audio track the critic did before cancer took his voice) both of which are very insightful into the story of the film (okay both gave commentaries for the theatrical cut as well, but these are even better).  Proyas of course gives more technical facts when commentating while Ebert (as the critic) is more on noting Proyas' visual choices and story points.  Both are must sees for fans of this film!<br /><br />"Sleep now~"</p></body></html>

In THE TRANSPORTER II, director Louis Leterrier presents Jason Strathan as Frank Martin, who as in the original TRANSPORTER, contracts to deliver the goods without fail, regardless of the goods to be delivered. In this sequel Frank Martin has the more mundane job of bodyguard/chauffeur to a cute little boy.  Frank lives by only a few Golden Rules, one of which is that he will never promise what he cannot deliver.  He promises that no harm will come to the little boy, who is promptly kidnapped by a cocaine cartel druglord.  The bulk of the film is a non stop series of action sequences that occur so breathtakingly fast that the viewer does not have time to ponder their believability.  There is one sequence in which Frank drives (flies?) a superturbo Sports Coupe from one building to another in a manner that left me wondering whether any stunt driver would have risked his neck in such a fool stunt.  Then there are the fight scenes that bring to mind Jackie Chan, who when battling the usual gang of thugs, uses whatever props are handy.<br /><br />Part of the problem I had is that TRANSPORTER 2 continues the cinematic tradition of presenting police as walking sitting ducks who act only as straw men to be knocked down both by the hero and the bad guys.  In this case the bad guy is a bad girl, well played by Katie Nautea, who uses a twin set of Uzis to slaughter cops whose only job is to preserve law and order.  Frank is no less guilty as he manhandles a half dozen U. S. Marshals who get in his way.  The distinction between celluloid fantasy and reality is often blurred by films like the TRANSPORTER series.  When Hollywood decides to make a more realistic film about martial arts experts who either enforce or break the law, then the interest level of the resulting film may rise above the superficially glitzy to the level of realistic cinematic violence that marks movies of enduring fame.  Can you imagine Gary Cooper slugging it out with the bad guys in HIGH NOON while swinging a fire hose at them?</p></body></html>

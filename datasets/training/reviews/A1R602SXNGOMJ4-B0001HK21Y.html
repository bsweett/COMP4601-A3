A set of grisly murders brings FBI Agent Will Graham (Norton) out of retirement and puts him in search of "The Tooth Fairy" (Fiennes) who's driven by the image of a painting. Yet his only means of survival and success are to seek the help of another madman, whom he himself captured, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). Marked by past scars and quickly running out of time, Graham finds himself tangled in a heap of madness, sacrificing his work, his family, and above all his own life, to put an end to pure evil.<br />The biggest problem with Red Dragon is Edward Norton as Will Graham; he just doesn't fit the part. To the films advantage, Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson both give outstanding performances. Anthony Hopkins plays the part brilliantly! Unlike Norton, these three actors seem totally natural and don't seem out of place at all.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Xmen decimated"></head><body><p>I love the Xmen comic books and I have to say the characters are really finely done in all three sequels. My all time fav is Wolvie and H. Jackman makes you believe he IS Wolverine. Rogue is just as annoying in comic book as she is in the movie. F. Janssen EXCELLENT Jean Grey.<br />All in all CASTING is best thing about all three films.<br />Xmen 3 - now I won't be recanting the story or giving my views on how idea of treating mutations as sickness relates to discrimination in our societies, just give my views in short (as always).<br />Story is decent, effects are reeallly nice but TOO MANY XMEN die! Well for my taste anyway.<br />Cyclops dies stoopidly. Jean Grey dies by Wolvie - why couldnt he just stuck the "cure" needle in her and turned her "normal human" instead of impaling her on his claws??? Arrgh!!!<br />The "other", low level mutants are depicted as disgusting transgressions of natural law and dont do much for likability of the mutant "cause".<br />Blah.<br />Who cares.<br />Good fun. If you liked first two, you will like this one too.</p></body></html>

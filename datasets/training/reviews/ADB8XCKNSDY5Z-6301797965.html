<meta name="summary" content="Gene Wilder At His Best"></head><body><p>Even though my favorite Gene Wilder movie is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, his performance in this film is much, much funnier.  "That goes without saying."<br /><br />I think my favorite scene takes place at the very beginning of the film where Wilder gives a lesson on involuntary reactions.  Unnecessary vulgarity and abuse of an old man has never been funnier.<br /><br />The Putting on the Ritz perfomance is pretty good too.  But it may never have happened if the doctor's assistants in the castle would have opened the door when he was alone with the monster.  "No matter how terribly I may scream, do NOT open that door!"<br /><br />In no way is this movie a failure.  "In science we must learn to accept our successes as well as our failures, with quiet dignity and grace."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="it ain't happening"></head><body><p>*The Happening*, while entertaining in some parts, was, overall, a disappointment.<br /><br />En masse, people are killing themselves, using whatever methods are available whether it be walking off a tall building, driving into a tree, impaling, or stepping in front of a moving vehicle.<br /><br />A small group of people (including Wahlberg and Leguizamo) soon realize that it's a toxin coming from plants defending themselves.  However, this angle is never really fully developed.  So, from the scenes, you could infer that the plants are protesting against overpopulation, overbuilding, global warming and whatnots.<br /><br />However, there are just things that do not make sense.  Plants are everywhere and everyone would be dead within minutes.  Why only in the Northeastern states?  Plants aren't isolated in that region.  When the movie is over, everything is back to normal as if there wasn't even a dent in the population.  Just unbelieveable.<br /><br />In addition, there was no "Oh, my God!" moment as was seen in *Sixth Sense*.  In hindsight, I'm starting to believe that *Sixth Sense* was just a lucky movie for M. Night Shyamalan because all his succeeding movies (except *The Village*) aren't quite the same...in fact, they've gotten progressively worse.  So, I think it's time to stop expecting Shyamalan to pull off another jaw-dropping movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More Style than Substance? Maybe, But with this Much Style, it doesn't Matter!"></head><body><p>I was gifted this movie and my first thought was, "What the hell is a Slevin?", but thanks to its clever dialogue, tongue-in-cheek humor, and excellent actors, Slevin quickly made it onto my short-list of favorite films.<br /><br />This is a film that savors contrast, both in visual as well as narrative terms. Almost everything, from the wallpaper and floor tiles, to chessboards, and especially the central characters, suggests duality, light and dark, good and evil. The film itself goes from clever comedy to brutal revenge tale in the space of a single scene.<br /><br />Cool visuals don't make a movie, but Slevin has plenty of cool in other places as well. Hartnett and Liu are charming and have some of the best on screen chemistry I've seen in a long time. Freeman and Kingsley are fun to watch in roles they don't usually get to play, and Willis delivers his usual steely-faced assassin bit with just the right amount of humanity.<br /><br />DVD has no extra features - nada, zilch. So if you dig that stuff, you'll miss it here. Dolby Digital is available though, so you can at least get that theater quality audio.</p></body></html>

But anyhow...<br /><br />So many good reviews of this movie have been written about the plot, etc.  I just want to give my evaluation and opinion of various things.<br /><br />The Shining (1980) is based on the novel by Stephen King.  Director Stanley Kubrick gave us a masterpiece.  I like nearly everything about this movie.  I remember seeing it on cable TV around 1980 and 1981.  This is a different kind of horror movie in that it is not over the top with LOTS of blood and gore and LOTS of killing.  Instead, it's a movie that has a moderate amount of blood and killings (with the exception of the scene with the tidal wave of blood), but it's greatest strength is its reliance on atmosphere and the gradual buildup of tension and horror.  Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) gradually becomes a madman over time.  Wendy Torrance (Shelley Duvall) becomes increasingly terrified.  Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) is effective as the son that possesses psychic abilities.  The story and setting are very simple.  The hotel itself seems to be a character itself.  The atmosphere in the hotel is eerie with a sense of emptiness, but frightening.  There's a feeling that strange and horrifying things are bound to happen in this huge vacant hotel.  Again, the buildup to all-out madness is the movie's strongest point.<br /><br />The camera angles that are used at times are very innovative.<br /><br />The best acting performance in this movie was by Shelley Duvall, in my opinion.  She was totally believable.  Jack Nicholson also gave a great performance.<br /><br />The electronic musical score is great and very memorable.  It's the kind of music that crawls under your skin and adds to a tense atmosphere.<br /><br />My favorite scenes are the bar scene where Jack is having a drink and talking to the bartender, the scene where Wendy discovers what Jack has been typing all along, and the chase around the maze during the snowstorm.<br /><br />This movie is a classic that has stood the test of time.  It's definitely one of the all-time great horror movies.  Stephen King himself actually hated it, but horror movie fans generally like it.<br /><br />This two-DVD set contains commentary by Steadicam inventor and operator Garrett Brown and historian John Baxter, the theatrical trailer, Vivian Kubrick's documentary called The Making Of The Shining, and featurettes called View From The Overlook: Crafting The Shining, The Visions Of Stanley Kubrick, and Wendy Carlos, Composer.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Shining to all horror fans.</p></body></html>

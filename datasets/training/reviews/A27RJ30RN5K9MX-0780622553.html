To make matters worse, there is a dead woman next to him, and he soon discovers that he is the prime suspect in a murder investigation involving prostitutes. He is being chased on both sides of the law. Inspector Frank Bumstead ( William Hurt) is a skilled cop that never gives up. He only believes in what he sees, and in his eyes, John is a murderer. But things are about to get a lot worse when John discovers his other pursuers. &quot;The Strangers&quot; are a mysterious group of beings that possess the ability to stop time and alter reality. John is now determined to solve the riddle of why the city is always different day after day, why it's always dark, and why they are after him. The only problem, is that the truth could be fatal... <p>&quot;Dark City&quot; is one of the best Sci-Fi films that you will ever see. The story is in a gotham like city set in the 1940's. All of the costume and building designs are outstanding. Next, the story is extremely original. The idea of being able to alter reality, and keep it from an entire city is actually interesting. Alex Proyas did a great job with how he worked the characters into the story. All the main characters play an important part, and help to further develop the plot. Rufuss Sewel was outstanding as John Murdock. His determination to find out why he's so special is unreal, and when you find out why the &quot;Strangers&quot; are targeting him, you will be very surprised. Jennifer Connelly is great as John's wife. The emotion that she shows is very realistic. Nice chemistry between her and Sewell. Kiefer Sutherland gave my favorite performance. He is the wild scientist that helps &quot;The Strangers&quot; with their mission. It was definately a different role for Sutherland, but still great. William Hurt was great as Frank Brumstead. Plays the typical cop who only believes in rational explanations. &quot;The Strangers&quot; themselves were excellent and actually frightening. <p>&quot;Dark City&quot; is one of my favorite films. The settings, acting, and extremely original story make it a masterpiece in the Sci-Fi genre. The DVD does not have much in the way of extras, but it still the best choice because of the quality and the fact that it is extremely affordable. Definaley a must own!</p></body></html>

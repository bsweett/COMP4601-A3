<meta name="summary" content="Not One of Fincher's Best but Good"></head><body><p>It was exciting news to discover that David Fincher, director of such films as Fight Club, Panic Room, The Game and the masterpiece, Se7en was the director of the film Zodiac, the serial killer (publicly claimed 13 victims, police pinned him to five) who sent codes and frightening notes to major newspapers during the late sixties and seventies and, strangely was never apprehended. Zodiac is a very good film but unfortunately not one of Fincher's best.<br /><br />The film is based on the best selling book by Robert Graysmith and the author is played in the film with skill by actor Jake Gyllenhaal. The character of Graysmith is portrayed as a bookish, stumbling nerd-type though as the film progresses; the character becomes obsessed with solving or identifying the Zodiac killer, and with this growing obsession becomes much more confident. Gyllenhaal (Rendition, Jarhead, and Broken Mountain) is a fine actor and played this character with subtlety and believability - a great performance.<br /><br />Robert Downey Junior as the chain smoking hard drinking rebellious journalist, Paul Avery, seemed to be a step down for this fine actor. If this isn't type casting, then I don't know what is...Downey's personal life has been rough, some would say unfair, but as his agent, I would have suggested he turn down this role merely because he has played this "type" many times, however he does it very well and to work with Fincher would be hard to resist.<br /><br />The role of Inspector Toschi was superbly played by Mark Ruffalo (Collateral, In the Cut) and was certainly up to this actors high standards.<br /><br />As said many times, it is a mistake to walk into a film with any expectations, because one way or another, they'll be dashed in some respect.<br /><br />David Fincher is famous (some would say infamous) for his attention to detail, this film is no different. But it lacked, for me, that intense atmosphere which most of his other films have: Se7en, Fight Club and Panic Room. That said, Zodiac moves quickly riveting one's attention and overall very entertaining.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent"></head><body><p>Definitely by far the best of the Pirates movies.  Funny, witty dialogue, interesting villain, a fantasy romance between a mermaid and a missionary and a race to the mystical Fountain of Youth -- what more could you ask for?<br /><br />Wasn't going to watch because I was so disappointed with the 3rd movie, but this one brings the fun back to the series.  Looking forward to the next one.  Penelope Cruz did an amazing job.  She and Depp have great chemistry together.</p></body></html>

It wakes the senses, makes you think and keeps you entertained. There's enough going on to keep your mind active, while impressing the viewer with superb special effects. The acting and writing take the film above the typical eye candy found to be the focus of many sci-fi movies. The Ultimate Edition includes a second DVD that's well worth watching. It contains many interesting, entertaining bits that make The Fifth Element experience that much better. I highly recommend the film. Even if you're not a sci-fi fan, the movie has mass appeal that anyone can find to be a fun theatrical ride.</p></body></html>

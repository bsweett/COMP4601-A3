<meta name="summary" content="ARTIFICIAL  AND  EMPTY"></head><body><p>Too scary for children and too childish for the adult audience, Terry Gilliam's THE BROTHERS GRIMM is a huge disappointment. Of course, the special effects are very well made, of course, the German countryside and its disturbing forests are on the screen, of course the costumes and the scenery are superb. But I didn't find in the movie the pleasure I had listening to the brothers Grimm's fairy tales or reading their collections of stories. Everyone knows by now, thanks to Bruno Bettelheim's "The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales", that fairy tales are narrations filled with a symbolic meaning destined to children; you may watch the movie as often as you want, there isn't an ounce of allegory or second degree in it. This is only pure first degree entertainment, a wild ride through a dozen fairy tales of which the screenwriter kept only the exotic and hair-raising flavour. Too bad.<br /><br />A DVD zone disillusion.</p></body></html>

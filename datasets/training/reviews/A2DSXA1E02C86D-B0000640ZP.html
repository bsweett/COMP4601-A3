<meta name="summary" content="An objective lesson in perspective"></head><body><p>Have you ever been offered the stale advice that one's view of the world depends on where that one is standing? Well, quite right, and THE OTHERS is an effective illustration of that truth.<p>Grace, played by Nicole Kidman, is the mistress of a gloomy old pile of a mansion on the British island of Jersey very soon after the end of World War II. Her husband, of His Majesty's Army, was, or maybe wasn't, killed during the conflict. Grace's children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), ostensibly have a fatal hypersensitivity to sunlight, which means that heavy drapes must always be drawn over the windows of the rooms they're occupying. To make matters worse, the electricity isn't working - the effects of the war and German occupation, you know - so lots of candle wax gets burned.<p>The movie opens as three former servants of the house, employed there before Grace's ownership, gain re-employment. They're led by the kind and imperturbable Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan). The three are witness to the family's increasing awareness of mysterious household "intruders", which open curtains, play the piano, and rumble about in upstairs rooms. Ghosts, perhaps? They remain unseen to Grace and Nicholas, the epitome of a frightened young boy, but are regularly observed by the sassy older sibling, Anne. And there's more than just a little mother-daughter friction, not helped by the fact that Anne is not shy about telling the help that Mom recently went crazy.<p>The trepidation that builds in this very atmospheric film is not due to any overt horrors. There are no skeletons or mutilated bodies falling out of closets. No ghastly spirits go "boo" from around dim corners, and no razor-sharp knives flash from behind curtains to carve up unsuspecting flesh in the middle of the night. Rather, the suspense builds slowly in the flickering candlelight, in a house surrounded by an interminable mist, and in the mind of an increasingly agitated Grace. Both she and the audience know something is amiss, but what could it be? And what's with those old pictures of posed dead people lying about?<p>Kidman is superb as the edgy Grace, and Mann, a new face to this moviegoer, is great fun as the feisty Anne. Despite that, THE OTHERS is one of those movies about which I felt ambiguous up until the end, at which time I suddenly became a big fan and said "Wow!" I would pay to see it a second time just to revel again in the delight of watching the perspective suddenly flip. This is clever scriptwriting.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A decent hit for X-MEN Fans"></head><body><p>Brett Ratner does a good job of delivering an action packed third entry into the comic series with the X-MEN III The Last Stand. I really don't understand the stupid bellyaching against the movie. The special effects were great, the acting was good, and the dialogue while nothing sophisticated fit the movie perfectly.<br /><br />The plot is similar to the other movies, the X-MEN do battle against Magneto's mutants and himself once again. The twist here is that an anti-mutant gene or antidote is being made from one mutant. This will turn the mutants human. Of course the moral tale is brought here once again for the mutants being a "disease".<br /><br />Ratner like Singer does a good job of setting up the action and tension as well as one director can having directed the profitably successful "Rush Hour" movies Ratner really didn't disappoint whatsoever with the exception of perhaps giving a deeper profile of the Sentinels.<br /><br />The Dark Phoenix, Jean Grey's alter ego comes to life and destroys everyone in her path, Magneto seizes the opportunity but even he doesn't realize the dangerous powers she has.<br /><br />It was also great seeing the other new X-MEN in here including Kitty Pryde , Beast, Archangel and other mutants like Juggernaut. Famke Jansen is very good here and sexy as always, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine again knows hot to hit the mark as Wolverine and Ian Ian McKellen in his last stint as Magneto is terrific<br /><br />This is a good old smashmouth action comic book film like the last one and I have to say if this is the last movie that I was pretty satisfied with the work everything did on the movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The epitome of the classic Hollywood film"></head><body><p>Just as "Gone With The Wind" raised the costume drama to new heights, "Casablanca" defined the Hollywood romance, with a touch of film noir thrown in.  What's remarkable is that all the contributors to this film did solid work before and after this, but for some reason they only gelled like this once, here.  Or, as Rick might say, "All the productions of all the movies for all the studios in the world, and they walked into this one."  Casablanca has become more than a movie.  It's an icon for 1940s Hollywood.  Or rather, it's full of icons: the trenchcoats, the fedoras, the fog and cigarette smoke, the starry-eyed closeups in half-shadow, the exotic locals and transport planes that whisk our heroes to safety.  Many films since have tried to duplicate the mood of this movie, but none has really succeeded quite the same way.<br /><br />Somehow the role was perfect for Bogart: famous for playing gangsters (he once said he worked his way up from third gangster to second gangster to first gangster), here is is playing a character who is in even more danger, and I think that's largely reponsible for the film's success.  For as a gangster the danger was self-evident; here, as a cafe owner, Bogie had to juggle corrupt police chiefs, cheating gamblers, angry Nazis and fleeing refugees, all while remaining calm, keeping his business open, and, as he so famously puts it, sticking his neck out for no one.  It's not an easy task, but Bogart's Rick makes it look easy; that's the key to his charm and allure.  There's much pleasantness on the surface in Rick's cafe, but there's always intrigue boiling just underneath.  It probably mirrored how a lot of Americans felt during the time.<br /><br />Ingrid Bergman is...well, I hate to use the cliche, but she *is* luminous.  She manages to suggest so much with a glance, a shrug, and both she and Bogart have long pasts that are wisely not dealt with in detail.  (Thirty years later, the creators of "Chinatown" did a similar wise thing with the J.J. Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray characters, leaving much of their past as pieces in a puzzle.)  We can fill in the blanks, which just makes the characters more alluring and appealing.<br /><br />The supporting cast hits all the right notes, with special kudos to Claude Rains for what might be the best acting job in the film.  (Ebert says this in his commentary, and I agree.)  I'm constinually struck by how short Peter Lorre's part is.  I find his lack of screen time a little unbalanced, frankly.<br /><br />Some people call Casablanca the "perfect" movie, whatever that means.  That's a sentimental pronouncement--the film has its share of flaws.  There are some ridiculous plot holes--why would Nazis who put Victor Laszlo in a concentration camp allow him to roam freely in Casablanca once he escaped?; why would letters of transit--mere pieces of paper--stop Nazis from allowing wanted people to flee?  Ebert says we shouldn't dwell on these questions, and maybe we shouldn't, but the fact remains that the whole situation is improbable in the extreme.  The virtuals of the film are such that we don't worry too much about these details however: we just enjoy being invited into Rick's Cafe, and as long as we are in its cozy and fascinating interiors we will forgive certain transgressions of logic.  And the ending is about self-sacrafice in a way that will be lost on much of the younger generation, who oftentimes just see it as a sappy love story.<br /><br />This DVD release is excellent, with a superb print (hardly a nick or speck of dust), bountiful supplements and interesting commentaries.  Ebert's enthusiasm for the film bubbles over, and he dispells many of the myths that have cropped up regarding Casablanca over the years.  The documentary on Bogart's life and career is interesting, especially when the films he produced with his own company are discussed--many of these should be more highly regarded than they are.  People today remember Bogie as the great commercial Hollywood icon, but few realize he was also one of the first "indie" producers, and just like many of today's independent filmmakers he tasted frustration as less-commercial projects floundered.  An interesting bit of trivia: he developed and starred in a now relatively-obscure film about a mobile army surgical hospital in Korea in the early 1950s.  The title he wanted for this film--a title vetoed by the studio because it was too odd and obscure-- was MASH.<br /><br />The Warner Brother's cartoon, "Carrotblanca," is the lowpoint of the extras.  Warner Bros. made thousands of inspired cartoons during its heyday, but this isn't one of them.  On the whole, though, this DVD set has enough extras to satiate even the biggest Casablanca fan or Bogart buff.  Buy this release: it will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="30 Days"></head><body><p>Just imagine - you and your buddy have the chance of a lifetime: to soak in the local ambiance of the English countryside.  You don't have much money, and when you can't hitch a ride: you walk.<br /><br />The road on the moor is muddy, the air damp and chilly.  The barren hills seemingly go on forever.  As the gloom is descending into night, you enter a village.  You are cold and hungry, so when you see the pub, you hurry into the "Slaughtered Lamb."<br /><br />The clientele hush, gawk, and then turn back to playing their games and tipping their pints.  The barmaid takes your order, a man tells a joke, and as a man is about to throw a dart, you ask, what the pentagram and candles are for?  The dart misses.  The pub's atmosphere darkens with clouds of fear and unwelcome winds blow you out into the night.<br /><br />You press on, surely there is another place you can stop.  To add to your misery, a cold rain begins to shroud you in its clammy wetness.  Thankfully, it is short lived; the clouds part, moonlight bathes the mist.<br /><br />To your consternation, the full moon doesn't reveal the road; where is it?  Time to go back!  You try to retrace your steps, but then - from just beyond the blowing mist - comes a hair-raising howl . . . .  Before this night is over, your buddy will join the undead, and in 30 days, you will create pandemonium in Piccadilly Circus . . . .<br /><br />Blu-ray experience:  When you select "pause", "slow motion", or "fast motion", a nearly useless menu intrudes at the bottom of the screen.  Picture quality: 3.5, grainy.</p></body></html>

Ever since, the day it was announced that Fox was going to produce and release it. There were a lot of critics, who even doubted the movie make it to number one at the box office. But, when Fantastic Four came out. This movie prooved everyone wrong, including myself. The prouducers of the movie picked a truly great cast. The special effects are just super!!!!</p></body></html>

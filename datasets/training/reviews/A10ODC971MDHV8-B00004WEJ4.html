<meta name="summary" content="Casablanca"></head><body><p>No film has embedded itself more firmly in the collective imagination than this captivating, still-unparalleled romance adventure, which epitomizes everything that Hollywood filmmaking--at its very best--strives to be. Was there ever a more unlikely yet perfect pairing than the radiant Bergman and the world-weary Bogart? Portraying the twilight of civilized society in a foreign place, and the rising menace of new world evils, director Curtiz masterfully juggles tragedy and humor, intrigue and action to tell a timeless story rich in personal and political detail. And what an indelible, heart-catching finale! "Casablanca" won Oscars for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay, and continues to mesmerize on repeat viewings.</p></body></html>

As a whole, this was not an entertaining movie for me.<br /><br />The film certainly has an interesting concept: The Brothers Grimm (Matt Damon & Heath Ledger) are con-artists who go from town to town exorcising witches and demons and such from the local townsfolk. When they are recruited by a constable who forces them to battle the haunted forest of Marbaden to rescue several missing children (i.e. Gretyl, Little Red Riding Hood) they have no choice but to accept or be punished.<br /><br />The performances by Damon and Ledger are good, and the cinematogrphy is nice "eye candy"  throughout the picture. The movie looks decent, but then it turns into crap less than halfway through.<br /><br />Clumsy direction, a weak script, faulty editing, & bad French accents, turn "The Brothers Grim" into a mess of a movie.<br /><br />Besides a few short but fleeeting comedic lines, the "Brothers Grimm" was a real disppointment; and as far as summer films go, this was a total let down. You would think that after delaying the release of the film for a year (a clear sign of trouble) , they could have put something better together.<br /><br />Many people applauded in the theater after the movie had ended. I am not sure if they were applauding beause they liked the movie or they were just glad to see it finally come to an end.<br /><br />In the case of this reviewer, I'd definitely have to go with the latter of the two.</p></body></html>

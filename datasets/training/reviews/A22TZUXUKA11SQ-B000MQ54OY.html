<meta name="summary" content="An endearing story about a kid who isn't like everyone else"></head><body><p>In the tradition of Finding Nemo, Happy Feet is the story of the kid who just isn't like the others. Mumble is the son of two emperor penguins that both have beautiful singing voices. The emperor penguin uses song to find a mate, so it's important that they learn from an early age to sing from their heart so that they can find their one true love. Unfortunately for Mumble, he can't sing. Not just can't sing well, but can't sing at all, to the point where the penguins' vocal coach--who has never turned down a case--throws up her hands in defeat when he tries. Instead, Mumble has another talent. He likes to dance. His "happy feet" make him stick out like a sore thumb and cause him to be an outcast in the penguin community. Like Mumble's father says, dancing "just ain't penguin." Happy Feet is the story of Mumble's struggle to find a way to fit in with the rest of the crowd.<br /><br />Having just watched March of the Penguins, Happy Feet was such a welcome change from the sad tale of how harsh life is for these animals. The entire time I watched MotP, I kept wondering what in the world sustains these male penguins as they stand in the freezing cold protecting these eggs. In Happy Feet, the answer is song. The male penguins huddle together for warmth, singing their heart song, and wait for their mates to return. It's romantic and endearing at the same time. I think anyone who liked March of the Penguins will enjoy Happy Feet. I would also recommend that the people who enjoy this movie see MotP.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Second only to "Apollo 13" among Ron Howard's films."></head><body><p>It's an odd thing: Ron Howard is undeniably a fine director, yet it's seldom that he delivers a totally satisfying movie. Howard is extremely adept technically, he knows how to keep a story moving, he has an excellent sense of humor, and his level-headed, humane approach to his material is reminiscent of the late William Wyler. But he's also a sentimentalist, averse to real tragedy, compelled to tidy up messy or overly quirky emotions and situations, both comedic and dramatic. "The Grinch Who Stole Christmas" and "Far and Away" were unmitigated disasters; "Backdraft" had superb fire scenes and a few solid performances, but also an over-reliance on ancient movie cliches. There is only one kind of script that really spurs Howard to make a masterpiece: a true-life story of complex yet admirable, courageous people who overcome adversity against overwhelming odds. (And even that is not always surefire; "A Beautiful Mind" just missed greatness because of Howard's unwillingness to face the seamier implications of John Nash's insanity and narcissism.) So Howard has only two authentic masterpieces to his credit; the first is "Apollo 13" and the second is "Cinderella Man." "Cinderella Man" speaks to all of Howard's strengths, and draws in none of his weaknesses; the story of Jim Braddock, down-on-his-luck Depression boxer who ends up World Heavyweight Champion, is a genuinely moving, uplifting story of triumph over poverty and despair. It doesn't hurt at all that Russell Crowe, an actor of genius, is rapidly becoming for Howard what Brando was for Elia Kazan. Whatever one might think of Crowe's offscreen behavior, on screen he is a nonpareil at portraying simple human decency and making it not only touching but fascinating. With Crowe, you must always watch the eyes; they and they alone tell us the desperation behind Braddock's upright moral character and constant self-sacrifice. It's the same gift Jimmy Stewart and Spencer Tracy had. (Tom Hanks--another Howard favorite--also has it.) There's a whole squadron of fine actors behind Crowe in "Cinderella Man," including Renee Zellweger, a specialist in smiling through tears and feisty courage, as Braddock's loyal wife, Mae; Paddy Considine as a mate of Braddock's who hits the skids; Bruce McGill (unrecognizable as D-Day from "National Lampoon's Animal House") as a cold-hearted fight promoter; and Craig Bierko, playing Braddock's rival Max Baer compellingly (if perhaps inaccurately) as a boastful, vindictive clown. But the real winner among the supporting actors is Paul Giamatti as Joe Gould, Braddock's fast-talking agent. Giamatti is one of the very few living actors who can match or even exceed Crowe scene for scene, and their scenes together are by far the best in the movie, better even than the meticulously staged fight scenes that Howard plays for maximum suspense. Exquisitely shot by Salvatore Totino, superbly edited by Mike Hanley and Dan Hill (who won an Oscar for editing "Apollo 13"), "Cinderella Man" is second only to "Apollo 13" among Ron Howard's films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is one of the worst movies of all time."></head><body><p>I could not believe how bad this movie was!  Paul Anderson made AvP a bad movie, but I didn't know he could possibly write something this bad.  He even goes as far as stealing the "We are assets, expendable assets" line from Predator and "Newt, I like that" line from Aliens (although it's "Angie, I like that").  There is no reason for the audience to care about any of the characters as there is only one returning from the original movie and the rest are just thrown in for thrills.  Jill Valentine's inclusion is absurd and pointless as the first movie had nothing to do with the characters from the games, so why include them in the sequel?  Alice from the first movie is equally two-dimensional as she has suffered a complete pointless personality change.  She protested killing people after they were bitten in the first movie, but the first thing she does when that happens to someone in this is point a gun at them and prepare to fire.  Yeah, I know it's terrible.  This is the most illogical movie of all time.  Why would Alice drive her motorcycle through the stain-glass window of a church instead of walking through the door, and how did she even know how to get in there?  Why didn't Alice simply kick the villain's butt when he said "Fight him" and she said "no".  Moments earlier she had killed several guards with relative ease, but now she couldn't do it?  I don't think so.  I cannot believe that this story was bought and actually green-lit to be made into a feature film.  That's the most ridiculous thing of all time and after Ghosts of Mars and this movie Screen Gems' credibility has just fallen to rock bottom.  No wonder Paul Anderson didn't direct this, he must have known that it was one of the worst films of 2004 before it was even made.</p></body></html>

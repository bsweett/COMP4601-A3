One thing that really bothered me was how they don't explain why Louis and Marie did not consummate their relationship at first, so the movie just made it seem as if he was disinterested at first and then bam, one night he gets horny, so if you don't know the real story (there are several versions. One is that Louis was just very shy, since the marriage was arranged. A second is that he was afraid that his bride might attempt to manipulate him, since courtly intrigues were the norm at the French court. Another was that Louis had a medical condition that made having an erection painful, it is not until after a operation that he was able to finally consummate/enjoy sex) you wonder what is going on.<br /><br />The movie is just fluff, and in real life, in the 1780's, Marie Antoinette gained weight due to having children and indulging in treats, yet this is not shown in the movie so even at the end of the movie she is still slim and pretty. It may be nice to look at, but if you're a history enthusiast, it is painful to watch, and even if you're not, the story has little substance.</p></body></html>

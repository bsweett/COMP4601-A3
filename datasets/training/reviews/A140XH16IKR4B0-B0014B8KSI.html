<meta name="summary" content="Great drama about lawyers that is not about law"></head><body><p>Michael Clayton is a legal "janitor," a  law professional who cleans up messes, like those made by high-profile clients involved in hit-and-run accidents. But his own life is full of complications, both personal and professional. He works for a large law firm that is defending U/North, a chemical conglomerate, against a class-action suit with several hundred farmers whose health has been damaged by one of its products. Clayton's friend, the firm's top legal mind, is behaving erratically. To the dismay of the chemical giant, he is inexplicably in contact with the injured plaintiffs. Meanwhile, the restaurant Clayton owns has gone out of business, leaving him with a huge debt. His family has fallen apart and he is struggling to be a good brother to his working class family and a decent Dad to his precocious son. The pressures on the man are nearly unbearable, yet he soldiers on.<br /><br />The film's writing, acting and directing are top notch. The film is told as an intersecting jigsaw of actions and scenes, starting near the end of the narrative then circling back four days to give context to the action. Though it deals with the law, this is not a legal drama in the usual sense, but a personal drama dealing with people in the legal business. George Clooney is solid as the sympathetic title character. He is perpetually exhausted, unshaven and on guard.  Tilda Swinton is magnificent as U/North's driven legal counsel, Karen Crowder, leavening her nastiness with the just the right touch of vulnerability and desperation. Tom Wilkinson hands in another fine performance as the off-his-meds lawyer, Arthur Edens, and Sydney Pollack is completely believable as the beleaguered firm's chief, Marty Bach.<br /><br />Michael Clayton was not a movie I would have chosen for myself (the wife and kids were interested) but I found myself absorbed in its gritty realism, plausible characters and surprises. Not a movie I would run to talk about to my coworkers, but real enjoyable, smart and intense.</p></body></html>

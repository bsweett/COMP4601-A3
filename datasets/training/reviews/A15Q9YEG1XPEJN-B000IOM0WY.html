<meta name="summary" content="Really fun film with actors obviously enjoying themselves!"></head><body><p>The Italian Job is a remake of a British film of the same name.  I doubt there is a great deal here that is reminiscent of the original except the Minis.  That said, the actors in this film are quite obviously having a great time and it shows.  These actors are up to the task and then some.  Mark Wahlberg, Donald Sutherland, Seth Green, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Mos Def and a few others are here chewing up the scenery, milking the fun for all it's worth.<p>The plot is relatively simple:  Thieves who don't use guns steal 37 million in gold bricks - they get double crossed and have it stolen themselves - then they attempt to retrieve their ill-gotten gains.<p>What my synopsis doesn't tell you is there are all sorts of fun Bond-like devices and screwy situations that will keep you laughing and amazed at the same time.<p>Mark Wahlberg amazes me.  He earned my respect in Boogie Nights, but here he shows he's got longer legs to stretch as he tackles the straight man role in a comedic film.  He is really up to the task.<p>Seth Green is hilarious in his role, Norton, suitably creepy, Mos Def - unknown to me before - really a contender, and of course, Charlize Theron as the ingenue, is believable and engaging.<p>Nah, this film isn't great, but it's really good and it's almost good "clean" fun.  There is no sex, plenty of violence (but none graphic and none that is any worse than you'll find on TV), and only a few four letter words (to suitably secure a PG rating).<p>I think you'll have a blast watching this film.  I know I did.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="My favorite coming of age movie!"></head><body><p>The movie started with Thora Birch dancing to a East Indian music video, and it was wierd and captured my attention simutaneously. It's a good intro to a different kind of teenage dramedy.<br /><br />Thora Birch gives her very best performance in this film that had won her the best actress award at the Seattle Film Festival, but failed to get an Oscar nomination just like her equally amazing co-star Steve Buscemi. Her character is like a rebellious version of Carrie without telekinetic power. She and her best friend(Scarlett Johanson) will do anything but be normal.They like to act and look wierd and original in school, and she loves vintage music that was also in Buscemi's collection.<br /><br />In high school, she's a gifted artist, and her work impressed her funky and essentric teacher(Illeanor Douglas), who was a total comic relief in this movie. She's very supportive to Birch, but her work was too provocative that she was not accepted for the scholarship.<br /><br />After graduation, Birch find it hard to maintain her friendship with Johanson, because their interests and ideals are different. Ultimately, her only friend left was Buscemi, but he was being pressured by his new girlfriend to stop seeing her. So she's feeling like a ghost in her world, and she wants to leave her environment. She eventually headed to the bustop that she previously saw a old man got on an "imaginery bus" that goes to other worlds. She got on the bus and off she goes away from the ghost world.</p></body></html>

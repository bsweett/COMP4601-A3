It has some unique avenues to explore (not the least of which is the profession of the main character) and it does so with a visual sense of flare and excitement.<br /><br />This is a happy movie, believe it or not.<br /><br />The film centers around a hit man and a business man filled with desperation who happen to make an unlikely partnership.  They meet in Mexico, at a bar, and seem to hit it off; both men seeking out a sense of companionship (or intimacy).  Six months later Julian (the hit man) shows up at Danny's home, seeking out his help with a job that he just can't seem to complete.  What happened in Mexico plays a large part in Julian's uninvited visit (trying to figure that one out before they tell you can lead to some pretty strange ideas), and it is because of those `events' that Danny agrees to help.<br /><br />Forget about the `hit' though, this movie isn't really about that.<br /><br />Thanks to some extraordinary (and unexpected) performances from the two leads, this little character study tends to make the most of its plot to create something that feels poignant and engaging.  There are moments where it doesn't quite work, or it doesn't feel as powerful as they want it to feel, but overall it is a very engaging and entertaining ride, from start to finish.  I love they way that they weaved an unexpected mystery through the plot, leaving you wondering almost constantly just how everything was going to a) tie together and b) wind up.<br /><br />That's called smart.<br /><br />The biggest reason to see this movie though, is none other than Pierce Brosnan.  I like him, and always have, but he's never really done anything that made me go "wow".  I first saw this movie back in '05 and I still remember him like it were yesterday (well, I rewatched it a few nights ago, but still).  He is just fantastic here.  His comedic timing is outstanding, and the way he paints a very real, very relatable presence, despite the outlandishness of it all, is totally commendable.  His ease with each scene, chewing scenery without ever appearing over-the-top or baity, is something rare.  While I can't really fault Oscar's lineup that year (I have not seen `Good Night and Good Luck' but Phoenix, Hoffman, Howard and Ledger were all very good performances) I would certainly have given Brosnan a nomination had I had the power.  His seethingly hilarious performance is the stuff of comedic dreams (and the layers of dramatic intensity are just as effortless and believable).<br /><br />Kinnear is great too, but Brosnan really just takes the cake for me.<br /><br />In the end I give this an enthusiastic B grade.  I really liked it and would readily watch it again.  It is funny and suspenseful and carries an odd form of charm that makes this film thoroughly entertaining.</p></body></html>

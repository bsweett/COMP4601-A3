<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Film That Spawned A TV Series"></head><body><p>Not many films can say that they have spawned a television series. None that I can think of other than Stargate can say they've spawned a series that's lasted as long as Star Trek: The Next Generation. That's a feat in my book!<p>This film takes the viewer to Egypt where an ancient device is unearthed. The device, the Stargate, has the power to hurtle a traveler to distant parts of the universe almost instantly. A team consisting of Col. Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell), his team of soldiers, and Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader), an Egyptologist go through the gate to explore the world on the other side. They find the planet populated, and learn that not all the beings they meet are friendly.<p>The action and special effects in this film are first-rate. The actors are all excellent, and play very believable parts. Spader in particular does a very good job playing the geek. Russell, similar to his role in 'Soldier', plays a stone-cold military robot, only so because of extenuating circumstances you'll see in the film.<p>The special edition DVD is filled with extras such as deleted scenes that have been put back into the film. These scenes add to the overall experience of the film and help the viewer to understand the characters better. I particularly enjoy the 'making of' featurettes.<p>Pick this one up, it's a keeper!</p></body></html>

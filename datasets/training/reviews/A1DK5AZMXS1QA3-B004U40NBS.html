<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing"></head><body><p>The movies I see basically fall into two categories.  First, there are the movies that I am genuinely interested in viewing because I found the trailer, the source material (i.e. comic book, historical character), or the previous incarnation interesting.  These tend to be science fiction films, Pixar films, and movies derived from comic books.  Then there are the movies I watch because they are highly rated by critics and have been nominated for key awards.  Examples of the latter include the various Alfred Hitchcock films, the Godfather franchise, and the film Black Swan one starring Natalie Portman.<br /><br />I expected a lot from this movie seeing that it got Natalie Portman her first Best Actress award at the Oscars.  I was disappointed.  Yes, this movie's content clearly took considerable skill and talent to pull off.  But the movie itself was neither good nor enjoyable.  This film was not enjoyable to watch because there were too many disturbing scenes.  Whether it be the imagined lesbian love scene, or the scene where Ms. Portman's character masturbates, or the various scenes where she confronts her mother, all of them were disturbing scenes that made the characters revolting.  Nothing was exotic, or even lurid, just revolting.  This film was not good for various reasons.  First, it was not original; there are other movies about individuals going crazy due to an obsession or obsessions.  The Aviator is a good example of such a film.  Second, I could not empathize with any of the characters, and any good movie should generate audience empathy for one or more characters.  Third, there was no comedy, no irony, no romance, or anything else in the film to complement the emotional and physical tragedy.  Great films should hit different notes with the audience, and this one was one note only - tragedy.  And last, for a movie built around the beautiful Swan Lake, the set design, costumes, cinematography and overall visual feel was subdued.  Outside of the 5 seconds or so of the movie when the main character imagines herself transforming into a black swan, I did not find any of the scenes memorable.  Overall, quite disappointing considering the quality of the director, Darren Aronofsky.  Even more disappointing was that this film was actually nominated for Best Picture by the Oscars when other, much better films from 2010 were ignored by the Oscars, films such as Kick-Ass, Harry Potter, Shutter Island, etc...</p></body></html>

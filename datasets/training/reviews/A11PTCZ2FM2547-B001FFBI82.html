Leave out any one of the three, and the recipient of the story--even though he or she may be impressed by the authenticity, grit, and determination of the components portrayed--walks away from the experience with feelings of ho-hum indifference, at best.<br /><br />Such is the case with director Sam Mendes' JARHEAD ("High and tight, Soldier, high and tight!").  This movie depicting a Marine Corps unit's adventures during the 1991 Gulf War has a solid beginning, when we are introduced to several characters as they crawl and grunt through basic training before deployment to Arabia; and it has a middle, the subsequent "waiting game" the soldiers must endure prior to conflict--waiting that entails boredom, hydration, fighting amongst themselves, hydration, lamenting when their wives or girlfriends in the States dump them, hydration, going desert bonkers, and more hydration.  And then. . .nothing.  The unit marches through a barren wasteland, punctuated by burning oil wells belching hellfire into the sky, yet never encounters an enemy to engage.  Before a shot can be fired, the war is over; the unit gets shipped back home.<br /><br />There's no ending.  Granted, there is an "ending," but nothing to make us wonder, understand, or even give a darn why we were subjected to the antics of this bunch of soldiers--other than an underhanded agenda to gig the Marine Corps (duly noted by the narrating character).<br /><br />JARHEAD is a well-made, very visual, often intense film.  Lead character Jake Gyllenhaal turns in a gritty, sometimes over-the-top performance, and he's complimented very aptly by Peter Sarsgaard, Lucas Black, and several other young actors.  Jamie Foxx gets tapped on the shoulder to portray the stereotypical staff sergeant who yells and barks and admonishes and punishes and so on.  Mendes shows us the dirt, grime, sweat, comedy, drama, fear, insecurity, and immaturity of a group of males little more than boys out in the desert, augmented by an absolutely fantastic musical score; but he doesn't give the viewer an ending to match the story so diligently put in place.  It's dry.  I'll have a bottled water.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, WALK-ON</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Something's in the Air": Good Thriller, Preposterous 'Plot'"></head><body><p>'The Manturian Candidate' has two great things to offer, and one of them is the cast, Densel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber plus many supporting actors whose names you might or might not know -- Jon Voight, Kimberly Elise, Jeffrey Wright, Miguel Ferrer, Ted Levine, Simon McBurney, Dean Stockwell, singer Robyn Hitchcock, and wow! Bruno Ganz of German cult classic 'Wings of Desire'!  And I though I saw the face of Roger Corman.  And is that Walter Mosley the original book writer of 'Devil in a Blue Dress'?<br /><br />Besides these faces, the film effectively presents the paranoia suspence story with very brooding, atomospheric touch.  The results are often unnnerving, and almost successful in making us forget the plots and gimmicks that look no longer fresh and convincing as before.  Still, the film is worth your time.<br /><br />The film is about Ben Marco (Denzel Washington good as always) who keeps on dreaming wierd dreams since he came back from the Gulf War.  Back in Kuwait, Ben, knocked down by the emeny attack, was saved single-handedly by Sgt. Shaw (Schreiber), who beat the Iraqi army.  So America hailed Shaw as war-hero, and with Shaw's fiercely power-hungry mother (Streep), Shaw is nominated for vice-president.candidate, while Ben is still tormented by the nightmares.  And going to therapies does not help.<br /><br />But because of curious things, like a 'tiny sliver chip' Ben Marco finds in a strangest place, Ben starts to suspect that there is something going on within himself, within America's political system, or within America itself.  Is there any conspiracy going on around presidential campaign?  But is that possible?  And if so, how can Ben prove that when he knows his words would not be trusted anymore?<br /><br />The film's premises are no longer fresh and intriguing as used to be, and director Jonathan Demme knows that.  Instead of the straight-forward approach, Demme uses his unique camera works (like frequent close-ups or characters staring into camera) to establish the brooding sinister atmosphere, which prevails the whole picture with downplayed but shrewed use of such props as news flashes.  And if a character experiences hullcination in Demme's film, he does not see the so-called 'dream sequence.'  Instead, he walks on, right through the wall of the room, and quietly accepts the 'reality' of the next room.<br /><br />[WAHT'S MANTURIA?]  The original 'The Manchurian Candidate' starring Frank Sinatra (1962) has been thought one of the greatest political and paranoia suspence films ever made.  As it's classic status will not be likely to be replaced, Demme changed the meaning of 'Manturia' to something else.  The Korean War is now the Gulf War, and when the soldiers play cards, they just play cards and that's all.  Well, don't compare the original and the remake, and that's all I want to say.  You may think some changes are pointless, but Tina Sinatra (Frank Sinatra's daughter and co-producer of the remake) said OK, so it's OK.<br /><br />Not as great and unsettling as the original, 'The Manturian Candidate' is still a well-made thriller with good acting and the dark and effective tone.  But don't try to think about its John Carpenter-type story or its scientific accuracy.  The film is interesting in the same way as the famous story about Coke and the subliminal message.</p></body></html>

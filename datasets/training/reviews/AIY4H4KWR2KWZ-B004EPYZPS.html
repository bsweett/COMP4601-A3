<meta name="summary" content="For The Kids In Us All"></head><body><p>Occasionally, I get challenged by someone about a review that involves a children's movie - as if there were some magical demarkation between that and crap. There isn't. If you can't see that simple fact, then you have my sympathy for having blunt perceptions and an apologist mentality.<br /><br />A good film is a good film - period. There isn't a golf handicap for movies; a special pass for marginal, ineffective or failure.<br /><br />There are numerous fantastic productions that are specifically geared toward children that are simultaneously amazing films. Think about it for a second.<br /><br />'<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KQVDH8">The Goonies</a>', '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZCLH5S">Explorers</a>', '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VBJEFK">Ratatouille</a>', '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000031EGV">Jumanji</a>', '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055B7IPE">Up</a>', '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034G4P4O">The Adventures of Tintin</a>', and the list goes on and on and on. And consider budget conscious or sublime productions which sacrifice nothing when it comes to quality storytelling: '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K00NN0">The Sandlot</a>', '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005AUJS">Hope and Glory</a>', '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012Z361M">The Red Balloon</a>', etc.<br /><br />Again, funding isn't the issue. Quality in filmmaking is the key discussion every...single...time.<br /><br />So this question/challenge isn't about my adult perceptions. It's whether or not a film is a winner, middling, or just bites. It's not a fault for pointing out that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001I5628">The Emperor Has No Clothes</a>. Why attack the messenger?<br /><br />This amazing and completely engaging film is a perfect example of quality with no discounts for being geared toward younger audiences. Just a flat out enjoyable, fully constructed, and deftly performed production that just happens to be a kid's flick. In the vein of 'E.T.', a movie whose magic of storytelling, childhood adventure and personal sacrifice will hopefully embed itself deep into the hearts of youths everywhere. A hopeful prediction: Thirty years from now and all those new middle-agers will fondly reminisce about Super 8 and how it affected their lives, changed it even. Very much like Star Wars did for many of my generation. Well, a hope anyway.<br /><br />The story opens with a gang of misfit teens and the tragic circumstances that begins a summer that no one will ever forget.<br /><br />It's 1979 and the small town of Lillian, Ohio is about to undergo an unimaginable trauma. Joseph Lamb is one of a quirky group of kids whose big dream is to win an amateur movie contest. But their innocent days end suddenly with the death of Joe's mother at the steel foundry. Now an only child, along with his devastated deputy sheriff father, they struggle to go on without the heart of their lives.<br /><br />Still, as kids will do, they try to forget. Not with malice, but because we all know that children are children for a reason. For them, life goes on. And Joe finds comfort helping his friends with the film project. So it comes as a double shock when he learns that his buddy, the conspicuously boisterous director, has finally found a girl to play the co-starring role in their zombie flick. Shocking not only because he found a girl, by itself a noteworthy miracle, but because of who she is, or rather, who her father is in relation to Joe himself. He's the man indirectly responsible for his mother's death.<br /><br />But Joe is insightful enough to understand that Alice wasn't at fault and smartly holds no ill feelings. That she's also the most beautiful girl in school also softens the surprise. So, newly installed as the lone female to the troupe of goofy buds, the gang rolls on, both literally and figuratively as the film becomes their summer adventure. Guerrilla moviemaking, using standing sets without permission, is pretty common for young directors and the gang is no different, taking advantage when and where they can - including an opportunity to film one night at the rail station. But it will be a night like no other.<br /><br />Collectively, they nearly all get killed in the process of accidentally capturing the spectacular train crash near the town limits. Having been so close to the explosive wreck, they're amazed to be alive. They're even more stunned to realize that someone intentionally crashed the millions of pounds of rolling steel stock. Bizarrely - it's someone they know - their school science teacher. And he's still alive.<br /><br />Soon the local authorities like Joe's dad are quickly supplanted by the military, and US Air Force personnel carrying assault weapons and various strange gear appear on the scene.<br /><br />Something is terribly wrong.<br /><br />Things quickly spiral as more and more odd events start to occur. All their dogs go missing. The power grid fluctuates with no explanation. Miles of transmission lines and microwave ovens disappear; even entire car engines are torn out of the bodies of vehicles. Worse yet, there are reports of people who have just vanished. As the town begins to realize these events can't be easily explained away - panic sets in.<br /><br />Yikes.<br /><br />An incredible film - period.<br /><br />Movie Note:<br /><br />- When anyone challenges me to explain great acting - this is now the film I reference. The train sequence, as young Ellie Fanning switches 'on' her character. That is *exactly* what it means to be an actor.<br /><br />Personal Notes:<br /><br />- This was a reward for my hard work. I literally spent a solid year completely avoiding any review, comment or notation regarding this film. Trust me, in this Information Existence, this was no easy task. Quickly clicking off pages or even shutting down browsers to avoid the unavoidable pop-ups and hot links; changing the channel or muting whenever a story or advert hit the screen. For me, a serious endeavor that ate up a good portion of daily mental energy. So that when it finally came time - this was as fresh and clean as the driven snow. Had absolutely no idea what the film was about, who it starred, or even what theme the film could be categorized in. Pure ignorant bliss. (a more appropriate term would've been 'flick virgin' - but that somehow seemed vulgar) &lt;g><br /><br />- "Just so you know - I'm massively stoned right now."<br /><br />- "Drugs are so bad!"<br /><br />BWHAHAHAHA!  X-D</p></body></html>

An American writer of western novels arrives here to visit of friend of his. He finds him dead and buried. But he asks many questions, too many actually, and finds out that the police report of the accident that killed his friend does not know about a third man on the accident scene. The film is a masterpiece of suspense and plot with a touch of romance. Yet this film is also very political playing on the rivalry between the western allies and the soviets who jointly occupy the city. The immoral businessmen use this rivalry to navigate freely in the city. Yet the International police and the austrian police will find out the truth and will bait and catch the main ringleader. The question asked in the film is a comparison between the Borggias who produced the Renaissance with intrigue, plot and blood, on one hand, and brotherly democratic Switzerland that produced only the cuckoo-clock, on the other hand. Which one is better ? The question is not answered in the film because we are big enough to make up our minds alone. Let say that the ending is moral.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Not so Golden Age"></head><body><p>While this sequel to the 1998 film Elizabeth pales in comparision, it still finds some nice moments in a film that seems more content on the film more as a work of moving art, with its lavish costumes, gorgeous sets, and stunning cinematography, and yet human development somehow gets lost beyond all the pretty pictures and lovely costumes.<br /><br />Elizabeth's reign as queen is once again in peril. King Philip of Spain plans on Holy War against England and the protestant queen that rules it and plots of assaisination begin to form under the control of Mary Queen of Scots. All the while, Elizabeth finds her heart once again caught in the battle, as she takes notice of a dashing pirate, Sir Walter Reiligh.<br /><br />What's the film suffers is its seemingly vacant story line and the near absent soapy drama that made the first film so entertaining to watch. the director has all this great history to go upon and yet he seems more intent on the look of the film then the actual feel of it. As for Geoffry Rush, his character is reduced to nothing more but a side note that does not carry the same effect as he did in the first film.<br /><br />But the good thing is that on aspect of the first film did not change and that would be Cate Blanchett's performence. Still just as fierce as in the first film, she brings back all of the aspects of our Queen that we knew and love. With a bitting wit, steely determination, and the ability to show weakness at just the right moment, Blanchett is able infuse just enough life into a film that, without, would probally be entierly dead.</p></body></html>

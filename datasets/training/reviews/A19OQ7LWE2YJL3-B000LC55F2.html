You have to watch or you'll get confused, and it's not easy. But it's extrememly entertaining, artistic, and the acting of Caine, Jackman & Bale is just exquisite. Not like any other movie you will see this year.<br /><br />See also highly recommended: THE ASYLUM w. Natasha Richardson & Sir Ian McKellan</p></body></html>

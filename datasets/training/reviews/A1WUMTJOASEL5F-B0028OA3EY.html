That is the main problem with this world, Superman should be Captain Marvel, Dick Van Dyke, Hamlet, and Orson Wells all wrapped into one for our amusement and entertainment into believing there really is a Superman. That is the problem with legends throughout history, they are just people with extraordinary circumstances. They are not stand up comedians or grand philosophers. Superman is the last son of Krypton. He's at a point of struggling to find himself as well as be himself, a not so easy journey even for a man of steel. He is really an ordinary person with out of this world superpowers, and that's what makes him a Superman, not his lighter than air quips or fast talk, or gift for gab. That is why Brandon makes a fine Superman, not only does he look good, but he is a simple down to earth level headed soul. Just the right touch from Mr. Rough who leaves the stereotypical macho schmuck behind.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MUCH Scarier The First Time Watching"></head><body><p>The first time I watched this movie, I was scared out of my mind. It was sickening, I almost couldn't handle it.<br /><br />However, I rewatched it a few minutes ago and it's not half as scary as it was the first time. It actually became rather humorous since in the end there's a lot of irony to be had. So not so scary or horrific the second time watching it.<br /><br />I'm very sure what's shown in this movie has happened and is still happening in some parts of the world, maybe even in some parts of the US for all we know. People go missing all the time, in many countries it's not even a big deal. "Oh you lost your daughter? Just have another one..."<br /><br />The human species is more naturally prone to violence and negativity, we have to actually work hard to not be.<br /><br />Re-watching this movie, I noticed a ton of flaws I didn't notice much the first time due to being so scared. Do guys typically act this watch around each other? I hope not, I'm a guy and I find the typical a bit insulting.</p></body></html>

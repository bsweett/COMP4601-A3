Although, I wouldn't recommend this movie for children. It is for ADULTS ONLY due to the content of the film.<br /><br />You can read the description of this movie's storyline above, so won't rehash it here. I will however share my impressions of the movie below: The cinematography is brilliant & so was the computer graphics in this movie. I also enjoyed the acting and storyline of this movie as well. It was all so captivating. I found myself wanting to know how the story was going to unfold/end. No Hollywood ending here. This movie is anything but predictable, which is quite refreshing!</p></body></html>

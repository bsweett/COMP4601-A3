If this role doesn't convince you of his great skills, I don't know what will. He plays a hired killer named Vincent, with 6 hits to carry out. When he first hires a cab driver named Max played by Jamie Foxx we think he seems like an average man. As the story unfolds and Foxx and us realize what he is capable of doing, we are in shock and awe. Foxx is excellent in this role. Typically he has been type cast in comedies, but he shows he is quite capable of dramatic roles as well. He does a great job of playing an average man that is caught up in something he can't escape without taking drastic measures.<br /><br />I am a fan of Michael Mann and I am glad to see him direct another great movie. Scenes such as Max stopping for a Coyote, show how he is humane. While Vincent shows us how cold blooded he can be killing a Jazz club owner after talking to him about jazz. Any fan of movies like "Manhunter", "Heat", or Tarantino movies will definitely want to buy it. The style that Mann uses to show the dark side of the city and human nature is excellent. The quality of the DVD is first class and the extras include documentary, deleted scenes, cast, filmakers, and production notes, and more. Well worth getting for yourself or a friend that like crime dramas.</p></body></html>

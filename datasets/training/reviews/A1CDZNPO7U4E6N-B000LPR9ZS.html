<meta name="summary" content="the 3rd Sequel Curse!"></head><body><p>It never fails. If you somehow manage to get through the first and second film it's always at this point in most franchises where it usually goes down in flames. They manage to flush all the ideas that made the first 2 films so good right down the toilet. First of all, I wasn't crazy about the first "Saw", but "Saw 2" was really good, and most importantly for me the 2 tied in together. I hate it when they make a sequel and it has absolutely nothing to do with the first film. Not to say that this movie has nothing to do with the first 2 films, I'm just merely stating that I hate when they make movies like that in general. Anyway, deep down inside I knew this would stink, I guess I was just curious, and I had a little extra cash to splurge. Anyone who is familiar with the "Saw" movies know that you can expect a huge twist at the end. However, in this film, the end is where it fell flat. I guess if you like endings where everybody dies, and nothing is solved, then you'll like this. I felt like it was sort of cliffhangerish (if that's even a word). I don't see how there can be another sequel, but we all know they'll find a way even if it's a copycat to carry on the Jigsaw's work. At any rate, I think another sequel is pretty much a guarantee. This movie is just meaningless gore and unecessary violence with a horrible ending that managed to destroy the first 2 movies for me. American filmakers need to understand that you can't rely on showing a whole bunch of gory, nasty, and bloody scenes to the audience everytime you run out of ideas, and you know the movie blows. I notice they tend to do that quite often these days. They replace  the plot and storyline for blood and violence. That's not entertainment, that's a distraction, and it's plan-B just in case plan-A doesn't work. Distract us from the fact that the movie is so bad and show us a lot of scenes to gross us out instead. They know that our society is based on so much violence that's enough to satisfy a lot of people. However, I'm not so easily impressed. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate some of the concepts though. I do think it was pretty sick to do brain sugery on someone with power tools while their still awake. That was a good scene for me, but that's about it. Needless to say, don't waste your time waiting on the big payoff because you'll be disappointed.</p></body></html>

A parody of the Universal Frankenstein series of the 1930s and '40s, it features a brilliant performance by Gene Wilder in the title role, supported by British comedian Marty Feldman as a humpbacked assistant (a cross between Dwight Frye's Fritz and Bela Lugosi's Ygor), Kenneth Mars as Inspector Kemp (an homage to Lionel Atwill's Inspector Krogh), Peter Boyle as the Monster, Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher, the housekeeper, and Teri Garr and Madeline Kahn as a naive laboratory assistant and Frankenstein's fiancee, respectively, both looking utterly sumptuous. The cast have a riot with a great script. Look out for Gene Hackman's irresistibly funny cameo, too.<br /><br />The expressionistic shades and eerie tones of Gerald Hirschfield's lighting and photography capture perfectly the mood of the Universal series, and Wilder and Brooks's screenplay draws wittily from every aspect of the original films. While hilarious, it pays respectful homage to the Frankenstein films rather than getting cheap shots at their expense.<br /><br />This edition comes with a documentary and Mel Brooks commentary that will only enhance your appreciation of the film. There are some amusing outtakes/bloopers, although admittedly the rather longwinded deleted scenes reveal just how wisely the finished product was edited!</p></body></html>

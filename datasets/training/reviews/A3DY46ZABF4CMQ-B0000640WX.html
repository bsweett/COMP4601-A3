Rambo who upon arriving back home is greeted with the disgust and disrespect of his own people in the classic motion picture First Blood.<br /><br />It's not until Rambo passes through a small town in the heart of America and gets harrassed by the town's sherrif Teasle, played by Brian Dennehy, that he finally snaps. Rambo escapes the clutches of the town's law enforcement officers into the nearby forested mountains where he feels right at home considering that he was a green beret. The officers are in for a surprising all out war as Rambo takes them down one at a time and singlehandedly brings havoc to their tiny city that they call home. The only man who can possibly bring him in is his former trainer, Colonel Trautman, played brilliantly by the late Richard Crenna (the role was originally offered to Kirk Douglas but he eventually turned it down).<br /><br />First Blood is an extraordinary film that reveals how mistreated the veterans of the Vietnam war were. The film also reveals Stallone's action movie star abilities, something he would later be typecast with, and in addition to the Rocky role, the film gave Stallone his second most popular onscreen character as Rambo.<br /><br />First Blood also began a series of Rambo movies: 1985's Rambo: First Blood Part 2, and 1987's Rambo 3, but neither sequel came close to the brilliance of the original.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A-</p></body></html>

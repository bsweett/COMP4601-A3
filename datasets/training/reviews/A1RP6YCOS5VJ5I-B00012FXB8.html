<meta name="summary" content="Just Doesn't Live Up To The Second Film-Aliens"></head><body><p>An interesting entry for sure. This movie has all of the makings for a good movie, highlighted by the new CGI alien. I really like the movie but after the high that is Aliens, it just doesn't rise to the same level.<br /><br />The end is emotional but felt a little forced. It was interesting to see Bishop, the real person who invented the Bishop cyborgs. He being on here means that this movie must not have taken place that long before Alien vs. Predator, since we see the return of the real Bishop in that movie.<br /><br />Overall good, wonderful story, but it just doesn't come off as good as what preceded it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Pleasant Surprise, Including The Price"></head><body><p>Before I begin, let me state that this Blu-Ray is of decent quality; not sharp the entire picture but most the time and good overall.....and a steal at the current price here at $9.99.<br /><br />When I saw this at the theater three or four years ago, I was surprised how good this movie was, not stupid as I figured. Apparently a number of people agreed as a sequel was spawned. In other words, this turned out to be a popular film and subsequent DVD.<br /><br /> It's another one of those based-on-a-comic book hero films that seem to be sprouting up all over the past few years. Some of these guys are pretty dark heroes. This is an example. It was more of a pretty brutal revenge-crime movie. It's a rough movie, pure and simple......not the sweetness of Superman and Lois Lane.<br /><br />Some of the action is ludicrous but the most ridiculous of all - the fight against the huge Russian, is actually the most fun of the action scenes. The rest is just plain mean as the hero's entire family gets wiped out by gunman and "The Punisher" (Thomas Jane) goes after them after almost being killed himself.<br /><br />A smart aspect of this film was inserting a bit of humor in it, such as the two nerds down the hallway who befriend "The Punisher."<br /><br />The sometimes-juvenile but interesting action scenes, the diverse characters in here and the humor all combine to make this much better than anticipated.</p></body></html>

My wife and I watched this for the second time last night (first was in the theater) and we had forgotten how great this movie really was.  The chemestry between all the charactors is perfect.  Will and Kevin have real presence together, but the scene stealer is always Kevin James.  He just has a way of making you laugh at EVERYTHING.  He's the reason 'King of Queens' is one of my favorite shows (next to 'Yes, Dear')  Anyways, 'Hitch' revolves around Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens (Smith) who is a dating consultant for men who want to sweep the woman of their dreams off their feet.  His next job is poor Albert (James) who is in love with Alegra Cole, some rich high society sociallite, kinda like a soffisticated Paris Hilton.  So he enlists Hitch to help him get the girl.  And it works.  Now the real story here lies with Hitch falling in love with Sarah (Mendez) who is a gossip collumist who believes that the 'Date Doctor' is just an urban myth.  The problem with Hitch is that his own medicine doesn't seem to work on him and he just seems to screw everything up with the girl.  The great thing about this movie is that no matter who your watching your going to be laughing.  The movie as a whole is just really entertaining and very well put together.  Will Smith is always a good actor, very funny and he has that charm that makes you watch him.  But, as good as Smith is here he lacks that 'everyman' quality that makes Kevin the highlight of the film.  Watch this movie with that special someone, it's the perfect date movie and is a movie you can recommend to pretty much EVERYONE.</p></body></html>

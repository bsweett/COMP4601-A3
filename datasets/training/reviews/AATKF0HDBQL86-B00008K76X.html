<meta name="summary" content="Way to go, Ben!!"></head><body><p>I've long been a fan of Tom Clancy's novels, and when The Sum of All Fears came out as a movie, I had to go see it because I hadn't seen a Jack Ryan film in a long time (I'd watched The Hunt for Red October once in the theater and numerous times on video, but Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger were just plain boring).  Let me tell you, from the first minute I was HOOKED!  The Sum of All Fears had everything that the last two movies lacked--a good potboiler of a plot, lots of action, and an awesome new Jack Ryan in Ben Affleck, who made the character very believable and human.<p>This movie had a great cast of supporting actors as well.  I loved seeing Morgan Freeman as Bill Cabot, Ryan's boss at the CIA, and James Cromwell as the President.  Liev Schreiber as Clark was terrific--he has matured quite nicely as an actor since playing Cotton Weary in the Scream trilogy.  Bridget Moynahan did a nice job as Cathy Muller, Ryan's girlfriend, and it was nice to see actor Michael Byrne as Grushkov.<p>One of the things that I really like about the DVD release of The Sum of All Fears is the fact that instead of releasing a &quot;bare bones&quot; version (in other words, no extras) like they usually do, Paramount went all out and included stuff that provides a fascinating look into the making of the film as well as the thoughts of those involved with it.  There are 2 tracks of commentaries--one with director Phil Alden Robinson and the cinematographer, and one with Robinson and Tom Clancy, as well as a 2-part making of documentary that goes into some of the reasons they decided to restart the franchise and cast a younger actor in the role of Jack Ryan (for those of you out there who didn't like Ben Affleck as Ryan, blame Sherry Lansing, CEO of Paramount's movie division--it was her idea to cast him) and a visual effects section with commentary on how they filmed some of the scenes.  There is also a theatrical trailer.  While the extras aren't as abundant as on other DVDs, this is a nice surprise from a studio that is normally loath to put extras on their DVDs at all because of the cost of including them (as a matter of fact, Paramount usually won't include extras unless the director insists on it).<p>IMO, The Sum of All Fears is a great film, and a nice way to revitalize the Jack Ryan franchise.</p></body></html>

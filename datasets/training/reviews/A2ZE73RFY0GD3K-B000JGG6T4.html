<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Tale, Curious Behavior"></head><body><p>This is a good action tale if you relax and suspend disbelief, just going with the flow.  It's curious, though, how the protagonast reacted to the murder of his client.  He did not ask, "Why did they hate her?"  He did not sit in the corner and do yoga.  He did not form a coalition, dispatch inspectors, or levy economic sanctions.  He did not seek any routes of compassion, inclusion, diversity or tolerance.  He acted unilaterally, and merely set out to kill the murderers.  Shouldn't he have at least attempted some sort of non-violent appeasement, a more civilized, European approach?  Isn't that the best way to deal with savage murderers?  It's NOT ??</p></body></html>

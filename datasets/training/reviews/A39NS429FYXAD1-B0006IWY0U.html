<meta name="summary" content="Rousing Period Adventure at Sea"></head><body><p>Even better than the novel on which it is based, this rousing period adventure traces the nautical adventures of Lucky Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew.  Near flawless special effects combine with a solid story, cinematography, soundtrack and performances...most efficiently led by the great Russell Crowe.  The supporting performances and production design are also beyond reproach, especially an Oscar-worthy turn by Paul Bettany as the ship's doctor.<br /><br />A wonderful movie to enjoy.  Too bad there are no special bonus features to compliment the great movie.  Available for a low price, so who's to complain!?</p></body></html>

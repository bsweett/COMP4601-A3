<meta name="summary" content="I had no idea what was going on."></head><body><p>Normally a movie that leaves you with no idea what is going on is terribly annoying.  Not this one.  It's brilliant.  It hails from the era when detective movies were making the transition from sophisticated plots and sharp thinking heros like Sherlock Holmes to the furious action of gun toting thugs and hard-core cops.  The Maltese Falcon pioneered film-noir by introducing a small amount of action and mayhem with the hard-nosed hero performing several aggressive moves.  But on the whole the murders and action are simply the background to the psychological question of whodunnit and the movie is unburdened by profanity or graphic violence.<p>There are several main characters, notably abrasive Humphrey Bogart as tough guy private-eye Sam Spade.  He must sort out the mystery behind the murder of his partner, and untangle a complicated web of intrigue involving the beautiful Brigid O'Shaunessy, the mysterious Joel Cairo, the gunman Wilmer Cook, and the obese "Fat Man" Kasper Gutman.  In the quest for the fabled and priceless Maltese Falcon, there are several corpses that need to be accounted for.  Whoddunit?  For 99% of the movie, I had no idea, and was led on a wild goose chase of plot twists and possibilities.  The superb plot (based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett) had me well and truly baffled.  <p>But the deception of artificial tears or false stories does not easily fool the perceptiveness of Sam Spade, nor does opposition quickly repress his confidence.  Even the tinge of romance that is present is not overly sappy, because Sam Spade's determined moral principles easily overcome any passions for love or money that have conquered the villains he is pursuing.  The hero of The Maltese Falcon is in this sense quite unlike the hero of the legendary Casablanca.  His pursuit of truth and justice and immunity to the vices of girls and greed is completely inspiring, and so very unlike the movies of today.  When the solution finally came at the end, I was amazed, but quite satisfied.  Armed with the solution, I was ready to view and enjoy the whole movie again in a new light.  The Maltese Falcon is renowned movie from 1941 that ranks among the greatest detective movies ever, and is a real treat to lovers of mystery today.  Like mystery?  Go watch it.  You'll enjoy it more than once!</p></body></html>

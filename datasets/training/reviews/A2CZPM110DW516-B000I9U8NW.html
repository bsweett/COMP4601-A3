Trying to make even one hero with superpowers believable is a challenge, as is creating the necessary special effects, so imagine the task facing the makers of "The Fantastic Four"?<br /><br /> The long awaited big screen debut of the quartet that made Marvel Comics a force to be reckoned with succeeds where other comic book films have failed by being true to its original source. Unlike the "Batman" films, which owe as much to Frank Miller's reinvention of the Caped Crusader in the "Dark Knight" graphic novels as they do to Bob Kane's original creation, "The Fantastic Four" is faithful to the original comic book created by Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby.<br /><br /> With five major characters to deal with (the incredible foursome of the title and the villainous Doctor Doom), the result isn't head-spinningly impressive, but it has a charm that most comic book films lack. The movie doesn't waste time on exposition. It introduces the characters, well played by an excellent cast, and gets on with the show.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks</p></body></html>

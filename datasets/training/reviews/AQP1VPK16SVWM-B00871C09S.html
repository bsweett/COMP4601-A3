All of that said, "Rear Window" still stands tall as a film classic because of the themes, artistry of Hitchcock, the performances and the witty dialogue that we hear in the film. Unseen except for rare TV performances in the early 60's and rare revival house showings, "Rear Window" looks extremely good in its DVD presentation although clearly no complete restoration was done here like was done for "Vertigo" (but "Rear Window" wasn't in as bad a shape as "Vertigo" either). This edition looks better than the previous DVD (although it should be noted it's the same transfer as what was in the Hitchcock boxed set release four years ago)with a nice anamorphic transfer. Some people seem to think that film grain is a bad thing--it's not it's just how the film looks and "Rear Window" is no exception. Expecting this to look like a film produced in 2008 isn't realistic and it won't--but it still looks darn good.<br /><br />Extras are as follows: The extras that came with the boxed set as well as those from the previous single DVD release have been ported over to this release as well. We get two new delicious extras--a theme appropriate episode of "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" with the Hitchcock directed episode ""Mr. Blanchard's Secret" and also excerpts from the interview Traffaut did with Hitchcock for his book in the early 60's.<br /><br />Other extras: Audio commentary by author John Falwell, "Rear Window Ethics", Interview with Writer John Michael Hayes", "Pure Cinema: Through the Eyes of the Master", "Breaking Barriers: The Sound of Hitchcock", production notes, theatrical trailers, photo gallery, audio interview excerpts from Truffaut's interviews with Hitchcock,<br /><br />A plot synopsis is below for those intereested:<br /><br />Spying through a glass darkly (his camera lens), L.B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) believes a neighbor (Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. His evidence is circumstanial at best and the wheelchair bound photographer has to convince his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly)of the crime. In the process he puts his friends in harm's way. Hitch laces his film with more than a touch of humor and irony pulling this thriller together as it's L.B.'s peeping that reveals the ugly underneath--revealing something unsavory about himself as well without him truly realizing it.<br /><br />Hitchcock manages to do more with less than just about any director out there. Using a single soundstage, a small cast and the witty script by John Michael Hayes, Hitchcock crafts one of his classic films. "Rear Window" has aged yes but it looks, sounds and plays remarkably well fifty four years after it's original theatrical release. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

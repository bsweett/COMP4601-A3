<meta name="summary" content="WARNING:BAD MOVIE"></head><body><p>The Rock is great on WWE wrestling, but he is not "The Great One" in this movie. I was very disapointed by this bad movie. I expected that is was going to be good. It turned out to be very cartoonish. When one of the bad guys is hit with an arrow, their bodies fly backwards as if they were hit with a shotgun. How is an arrow able to propel someone's body into the air ? I also must complain about the special effects. The special effects are very poor. I expected great special effects like what I saw in The Mummy Returns. <p>If you want to get a movie with The Rock, then buy  The Mummy Returns instead. The Scorpion King should be erased from all movie history. It should have been produced as a one hour TV special, like Zena or Herculees.</p></body></html>

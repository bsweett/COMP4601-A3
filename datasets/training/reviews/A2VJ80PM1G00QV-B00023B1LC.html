<meta name="summary" content="Bang-Up  Action Thriller"></head><body><p>Creators do a nice job cutting through the multiple, often murky strands of Ludlum original, to give a clear, clear plot and lots of action. We need no more than to know that a Government Agency has a network of agents who can be used for black bag missions often involving "taking out" some person(s) to protect the nation. Bourne is one such agent, who has been shot and has, thereby, lost his memory, has become, to himself, a man without an identity. The Agency knows his identity, however, and when he surfaces in his search for who he is, they (for very vague reasons of security for the Agency from prying Congressional eyes), set out to liquidate him. He meets a girl along the way, and, of course, they fall in love. With a simple plot to work with, the film produces a series of dangerous situations and heroic feats of combat.<br />The film carries no intellectual baggage to weigh down the action, which is brief, sharp, and, satisfying. The lovey-dovey stuff is kept to a neat minimum, the brief scene showing him to be a killer with a heart, takes no time at all.<br />In short, this is a fine, well played, thriller, which makes two hours melt away to a seeming nothing. No boring scenes here.</p></body></html>

The last film was 15 years ago and John is still a tough as nails cop. Justin Long is pretty good as well, nice comic relief, always liked him on the t.v. show Ed. The stunts are pretty outrageous (that's a good thing), and the plot is intense, great music as well. I am not a huge fan of action flicks but this one is pretty entertaining, Die Hard 2 is the best in the series but Live Free or Die Hard shall make your aderaline pump profusely, enjoy!</p></body></html>

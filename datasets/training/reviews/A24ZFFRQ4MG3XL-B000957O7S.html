After hearing so many people saying how much they thought this was funny and great, I looked forward to seeing this movie.  I saw it last night and almost fell asleep.  I think I laughed once throughout the whole movie.  I love Kevin James and he's always funny in the King of Queens, but this wasn't the way he should have broken out into film.  Will Smith was way too smooth and Amber Valeta should stick to modeling while she still has half her looks.  Even if this was truely funny, all the funny parts have been shown on TV Trailers for so long, that the semi-good parts weren't new to me.  I'm sorry to disagree with you all, - this was a big waste of time.</p></body></html>

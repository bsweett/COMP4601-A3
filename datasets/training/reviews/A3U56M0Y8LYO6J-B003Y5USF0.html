<meta name="summary" content="A Fun Movie Even With One Twister Too Many!"></head><body><p>Twister is one of those goofy fun movies filled with colorful characters that you wish you could hang out with. The special effects are mesmerising but the one element that makes the film work is its well-developed characters. Helen Hunt's JoAnne Thornton-Harding and Bill Paxton's William 'Bill' Harding take up most of the spotlight but its Philip Seymour Hoffman's Dustin 'Dusty' Davis, Lois Smith's Aunt Meg Greene, and Jami Gertz's Dr. Melissa Reeves who have the best lines. All of these performers bring a natural grace to their roles and each time I watch their performances, I feel like I'm being reunited with old friends. I wish all my dinner table conversations were as fun as that one at Aunt Meg's. Kudos to director Jan DeBont who does a wondeful job following up his previous film Speed (1994) and to composer Mark Mancina who writes the best musical score of his career. I would have preferred seeing the movie end one twister before it did but that's a small nitpick with an otherwise entertaining movie.  Twister is a film you can watch again and again.</p></body></html>

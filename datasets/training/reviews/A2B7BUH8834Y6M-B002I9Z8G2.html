<meta name="summary" content="The best Star Trek film of them all!"></head><body><p>If you're a &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; fan, this is the film for you. The Federation's most deadly enemy, the Borg, are en route for earth --- and in &quot;Terminator&quot; style, they're headed to  earth's past to assimilate earth while they've still got technology worth  assimilating, but are too vulnerable to fight off the Borg's superior  firepower.<p>Excellent performances by the entire cast including the  awesome Alfre Woodard and Oscar nominee James Cromwell.<p>Relationships  among the crew (especially between Worf and Picard) are explored and  developed further. The friendship between Picard and Data is also put to  the test when the Borg Queen seeks to seduce them both with her promises of  power and perfection.<p>The DVD is lacking in that it just has a couple of  theatrical trailers and that's it. It would have been nice to see some  behind-the-scenes footage, special effects, out takes, etc... it's almost a  waste of the medium.  I first bought this on VHS, which included an  interesting motion photo of Picard, the Queen and Data (who morphs into an  assimilated Data when you tilt the image)... the DVD doesn't have this cool  motion photo on the box/case.  I definitely prefer DVD to VHS because  (unless you set it on fire or let your dogs play frisbee with them) DVDs  essentially last forever and tapes are not a permanent medium and are  subject to skipping, tracking errors and eventually, decay.  It's nice that  you can quickly jump from scene to scene w/ a DVD and there is never a need  to rewind before you eject... but other than the inherent advantages of the  DVD medium over tape, the DVD offers nothing else you can't view on the  tape. The tape version is also in letterbox format.<p>Other than the lack  of extras, this film is awesome. I sat on the edge of my seat when I saw  this in the theater and I see it at least once a month now that I have it  on DVD. It is exciting and entertaining and definitely the best Star Trek  film yet.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ONE WARRIOR WINS"></head><body><p>I have long been a fan of the films of David Mamet, except perhaps the one he is most noted for, GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS. While that film explored a number of ideas and concerns, focusing on the lives of its characters, I just could never get involved in it properly. Rather, I found his film HOUSE OF GAMES to be one of the most surprising films I had seen in years, holding my in it's grip until the end.<br /><br />That being said, Mamet's film SPARTAN offers no major surprises and many have claimed that it is clich&eacute; ridden, riding on the backs of spy films past and present. I found this not to be true. While some scenarios might seem that way, the whole plot beneath what is really going on for one, I found that movie fresh and interesting, in no minor part due to the work of Val Kilmer.<br /><br />Kilmer plays Scott, a career special forces Ranger who has worked covert ops and is now helping in training a new set of recruits. On his way home after completing this mission, he is called in to help with a delicate situation. It seems that the President's daughter Laura (Kristin Bell) has been kidnapped due to the bumbling of her Secret Service protection. Scott is one of those do anything no matter what kind of action heroes. He does not feel compromised when torturing a suspect nor taking out anyone deemed necessary by his commanders.<br /><br />Bringing in the latest recruit Curtis (Derek Luke) to help him, Scott sets out to find just who is responsible. The trail leads him to a group of foreigners who are part of a group trafficking human beings. The pair raid a house where Curtis sees the sign that Laura draws to sign her name. A situation arises where the suspects draw weapons and are killed before they can offer any information.<br /><br />Several leads direct Scott and Curtis to a Middle Eastern country where the traffickers are based. A Special Forces team is about to raid the location she has been taken to. As they are about to go in, the call comes for them to hold off as the girl's body has apparently been washed ashore back home.<br /><br />This leaves one problem. Curtis tracks down Scott and tells him he saw the sign. He knows that the girl WAS in that location. So who was the body that washed ashore and where is the REAL Laura?<br /><br />As the pair investigate, shots are fired and Scott finds himself on the outside, running for his life and the life of the President's daughter. Calling in old favors, he relocates to the house where the raid was to take place to rescue Laura. But there is more at stake than the life of this girl. A conspiracy to leave her behind is in play and no one save Scott seems to want her found. Can he save her and his own hide in the process?<br /><br />Toss in the fact that those trying to get Scott are in the employ of the President and you have an odd situation. It seems that those Secret Service men who were responsible for watching Laura were taken off that detail to watch out for the President who was visiting his mistress at the time. Being an election year, there is no way that they can allow any of this to become know.<br /><br />The action scenes are played well, complimented by the fact that there is some heavy duty acting going on in their set ups. Kilmer is fantastic as the cold killer who begins to have pieces of his armor chipped away showing the real man beneath. And Mamet, known for his dialogues, backs off of the over the top wordage in favor of a more direct approach to the conversations among these characters.<br /><br />The film looks clean, well cut and tells a story that absorbs the viewer from beginning to end. Some may not have been particularly fond of this film, but my guess is they were expecting the same old Mamet. Instead look for a story that keeps you waiting for the final revelation.</p></body></html>

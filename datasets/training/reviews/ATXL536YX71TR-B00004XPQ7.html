<meta name="summary" content="In remembrance of Ledger I gave THE PATRIOT a go!"></head><body><p>I love Revolutionary War movies.With Heath Ledger just dying,and he being a favorite in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDWKXI">Casanova</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JSI7AI">Brokeback Mountain (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>I decided to finally watch this 1776 film that seems to always be running on TNT or TBS!<br /><br />The screenwriter was obviously aware of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VEG24S">Williamsburg The Story of A Patriot</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790741970">Revolution (1985)</a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008CMT3">Shenandoah</a>(Civil War script),so much so that I knew everything that was going to happen next;not just because I know history, but because THE PATRIOT, in story, has been done before and IMO so much better.John Williams' soundtrack was only average.The direction of Robert Emmerlich was as static and staged as it comes.I found all of the performances to be very "overdone" and predictable as if this was a made-for-television flick; and at 163 minutes of this I am now glad I can say I have seen it,have seen better, and Heath you went on to so much better things.You were too young....We will miss ye!<br />For all of you who adore this film,start hitting the unhelpful button!</p></body></html>

The movie tells the story of prisoners of war forced to build a bridge for their Japanese captors. However the British commanding officer will have none of this and instantly puts up a fight.  Later the movie follows the prisoners efforts at building the bridge as well as the story involving Allied commandoes who are attempting to destroy the bridge.  <p> This classic is full of great performances that should not be missed.  Alec Guinness, who won an Academy Award for his role, plays Colonel Nicholson, the stubborn British officer.  His conflict with Colonel Saito(Sessue Hayakawa) provides much of the plot for the first hour of the movie.  William Holden is Shears, a man who escapes from the prison camp only to return with Force 316 as they try to destroy the bridge.  Jack Hawkins gives another good role as Warden, the team leader, who will do anything to complete the mission.  Also worthwhile is Geoffrey Horne as Joyce, the youngest member of the team.  This is not one of those action packed fliks that is so prevalent today.  The movie is really more of a character study than anything else.<br /><br /> The limited edition DVD is perfect and should not be missed by any fans of this classic.  The documentary on the making of the movie is very good.  There is also a widescreen presentation with many other worthwhile extras.  If nothing else, at least watch the last twenty minutes of the movie.  It is one of the most tense scenes in movie history.  You can just feel the anxiety as the end draws near.  Do Not Miss This Classic!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="...Still A Rose..."></head><body><p>I remember when THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE first came out.  I was highly suspicious of yet another girl-gets-possessed movie from hollywood. I mean, hadn't Linda Blair pretty much embodied that idea ever since 1973? Besides, EMILY ROSE? Isn't that a bit too much like AUDREY ROSE? So, I put off watching it. Silly me! After having just watched EMILY last night, I can admit to being totally wrong, mistaken, and pleasantly surprised. It's a well-told story, played out as a courtroom drama, w/ most of the demonic happenings shown as flashbacks. Both Tom Wilkinson and Laura Linney are superb as the priest and his defense attorney respectively. Of course, my favorite scenes were those of Emily herself, played w/ violent glee by Jennifer Carpenter (QUARANTINE, tv's DEXTER). While the prosecutor hammered away w/ cold logic during the trial, Emily's plight was played out in a beautifully tragic fashion, allowing Carpenter to swing wildly between calm, lucid moments, and animalistic frenzy. I was impressed! It was also fun to see "Deb Morgan" in such an unrestrained role. All done without 10,000 F-bombs, puke, or a single 360 degree head-twist! Amazing!

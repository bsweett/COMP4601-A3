Then I read the seriously critical reviews, and they began to explain why this show didn't satisfy. There was something empty about it, although I had a sort of advantage, in that I'd seen Silence, but not Manhunter. With this fine cast I thought I couldn't go wrong, but it became obvious that it was mostly just a cash-cow, milking the crowd-pulling Hannibal. Actually, I didn't think Silence was all that marvellous, either. The idea is that one homicidal loony can understand the mentality of another homicidal loony; but that's the only real idea, and after that it's just play it again, Sam. Oh, I suppose underlying this is that we're all loonies, since we can understand the other loonies. Then we can thrill to the sight of the handicapped, hare-lipped and blind, and the thought that happy, healthy, normal, nuclear families are getting massacred. It's all fairly sick, really. Richard III is better.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Independence Day"></head><body><p>After the sucess of Stargate, director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin did the old "bigger is better" modus operandi with Independence Day. Upon it's release, critcs bemoaned the film's over-the-top jingionism, cheesy heroic antics and disaster movie cliche staples- "Oh, quick, save the dog before the giant fireball destroys the city!" And to be fair, the film did deserve it's critisism, but as a cheesy, sentimental sci fi action blockbuster, it's one of the best.<p>For all Will Smith's jibes and Bill Pullman's heroics, it's Jeff Goldblum who comes off as the main man, pulling the same shtick as in Jurassic Park ("Must go faster!"). The film does get very silly at times, but never takes itself too seriously, creating a feel-good tone that works well within the caveats of the genre. Emmerich's ham-fisted direction gets tiresome at times, with so many sci fi cliches, you start to wish someone had thrown in an original idea or two. But the film gets four stars for action, visuals and some well-timed humour.<p>The SFX utilised are astounding, with some truly breathtaking visuals, and that now-famous shot of the white house getting blown to smithereens by aliens! It's good-natured, brainless fun, that while predictable and silly, is still one impressive movie that is a must-have on DVD. The extras are great, with commentaries on the first disc, and on disc 2 a wealth of extras including that famous Superbowl trailer "Enjoy the Superbowl, it may be your last", tons of "making of" docos and lots more production info.</p></body></html>

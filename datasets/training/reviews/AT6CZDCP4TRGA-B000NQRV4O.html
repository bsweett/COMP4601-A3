<meta name="summary" content="Interesting, but degnerates into soap opera..."></head><body><p>The 4 central characters are well played esp. Clive Owen and Julia Roberts, but this film just goes way over the top, opting for cheap fireworks instead of more examined fullness.  Way too many melodramatic reversals, too many histrionic fits and staged confrontations between the characters, until finally it just becomes repetitive and dull.<br /><br />The language is raw yes, but if you mind hey that's how most people talk under stress so grow up and get used to it.<br /><br />Julia Roberts does have probably the most "real" role of her career as opposed to her usual Barbie doll roles (excepting "Erin Brockovich"), but Jude Law and Natalie Portman are doing their usual familiar bits here, nothing remarkable.  Clive Owen egregiously overacts in the Al Pacino style but he's still fun to watch, like Pacino.<br /><br />Oh well, this still beats the pulp on TV at least.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Saw gets the saw......a good premise but it doesnt add up"></head><body><p>Two men wake up in a scuzzy and awful looking bathroom with chains and ankle bracelets on them attached to pipes. They dont know why they are there until they find 2 tapes and a recorder on a dead guy in the middle of the room. So, there's a sadistic loony killer called The Jigsaw Killer out there who loves to play games with his victims and has them play in dangerous scenarios involving barbwire, bear traps and fire. Soon. Doctor Gordon, played by Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride, Robin Hood Men In Tights) and the other man Adam, played by Leigh Whannell find out why they are there....they find 2 saws and to get out they cant saw threw the chains, but their legs to get loose. Some very creative moments with the suspense a very creepy looking clownlike doll on a toy bike and the surprise ending is the only thing that keep this at bay. The acting in here is subpar with Danny Glover (The Lethal Weapon Movies, Bopha!) wasted as a cop on the case, Monica Potter (Along Came A Spider, Head Over Heels) as Elwes' wife and Cary Elwes is so-so though he kinda gets ridiculous at the end where he saws threw his leg. Not for the squeamish and it's really dumb to see some scenes where they go into fast motion (example...car chase scene). Also starring Tobin Bell (THe Pelican Brief), Benito Martinez (TV'S The Shield) and Ken Leung (Rush Hour, AI:Artificial Intelligence).</p></body></html>

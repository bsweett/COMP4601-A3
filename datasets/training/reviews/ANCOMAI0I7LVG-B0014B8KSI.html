<meta name="summary" content="Needs no fixing; `Clayton' surpasses all expectations..."></head><body><p>I can honestly say that I didn't expect to like this movie, not in the least.  The only drawing factor for me was Tom Wilkinson, an actor I adore (his performance in `In the Bedroom' alone is iconic to say the least) but I had heard early word that his performance here was too loud and abrasive and screamed "give me an Oscar" and so I shrugged it off as unworthy.  I've never really jumped on the Tilda Swinton bandwagon.  Sure, she has some good performances under her belt but the cult status she has received is beyond me.  Clooney; well all I can really say about Clooney is that a long time ago I loved him so much he could do no wrong, and then the rest of the world fell in love with him and suddenly he lost my interest.  That said, the points for `Michael Clayton' weren't nearly as strong as the points against it and so I passed it over.<br /><br />Then Oscar nominated it for like everything and I thought; "maybe I need to give this a try."<br /><br />So give it a try I did and I can now honestly say that it was well worth the time.  `Michael Clayton' is one very well constructed legal thriller that nails the intensity and the chaos that circles events like these.  It reminds me of `A Civil Action' to a degree, yet `Michael Clayton' actually works.  I felt like `A Civil Action' was trying to accomplish something that was out of its league.  `Michael Clayton' does exactly what it sets out to do.<br /><br />Tony Gilroy makes his directorial debut here, working with his own original screenplay.  He's already proven himself a great writer (thanks to the impeccable `Bourne' series) and with `Michael Clayton' he proves he's soon to be a very accomplished director.  He portrays a sense of vulnerability here that suits the film very well, almost contrasting beautifully the states of the main characters.  There are single sequences so startling here you can't help but be drawn deeper and deeper into these people.  Shots of Swinton wrestling her emotions in a bathroom stall or Clooney staring mystified at a group of horses or Wilkinson lying in the fetal position chatting up a little boy; they all add layers of emotional depth to these complex and commanding characters.<br /><br />The film revolves around a `fixer' by the name of Michael Clayton.  Michael is the go-to-guy for messes his law firm wants cleaned up quickly and efficiently.  Michael ends up biting off more than he can chew when he is sent to clean up a certain mess left by his colleague and friend Arthur Edens.  Arthur has recently suffered from a mental breakdown and embarrassed the company by stripping nude during a legal proceeding.  Turns out that Edens has been reviewing a certain case in his head for some time and has come to the realization that his company has single handedly murdered many innocent people.  He just couldn't play party to the crimes anymore and is now determined to set things right.  The problem is though that there are many who want to keep him quiet.<br /><br />`Michael Clayton' manages to keep the viewer glued to the edge of their seats in anticipation for the next scene.  This has a lot to do with the amazing performances given by the cast.  We'll start with Clooney; an actor who I feel is a little over praised as of late.  His performance here is his finest performance since his turn in the Coen's `O Brother Where Art Thou?'.  He shows strength masked over by his vulnerability.  We can see all of Michael's personal demons yet we see his courage and determination that make him the man he is.  Swinton, or should I say `Oscar Winner' Tilda Swinton, is a force here.  She has limited screen time but she manages to work beautiful wonders with the character of Karen Crowder.  I was astounded by her range here, her ability to completely control a scene, and her final breakdown is pure magic; watching her character crumble under the knowledge of her inevitable exposure is so natural, so strong.  When she hits her knees, while only a background and blurred image, she is the only thing you can focus on.<br /><br />Tom Wilkinson doesn't show up for nearly thirty minutes yet his presence haunts the screen long before his figure does.  His voice over work which permeates the first twenty or so minutes of the film is pure brilliance.  I have heard his performance noted as hammed up or eccentric but I for I feel that he gave this film exactly what it needed.  He was convincing and mesmerizing to watch.  Watching his character explode with over confidence and determination and then shrink back in depressive fear and self pity was an astonishing feat.<br /><br />In the end `Michael Clayton' is one of the best films of the year.  I'm astounded at the impeccable lineup presented by the Academy this year; it's a rare treat when they actually nominate worthy films.  If you have been wary about watching this film, fearing that it'll wind up being `Law & Order' light and thus be unsatisfactory, please wipe those fears away and dive in, for `Michael Clayton' is one of those rare treats that delivers on just about every level.</p></body></html>

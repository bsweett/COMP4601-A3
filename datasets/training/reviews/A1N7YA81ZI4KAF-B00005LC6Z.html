<meta name="summary" content=""You Don't Know What Death Is!""></head><body><p>The second chapter in the never-ending series starts off where the first film left off. After her scuffle with the ever powerful and relentless Michael Myer's, a wounded Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to a nearby hospital. Myers follows her there with the determined Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasance) hot on his tracks.<br /><br />The original "Halloween" is a classic of the genre and is held in high esteem not just by horror film fans but by movie buffs in general. The sequels on the other hand are not. But that hasn't stopped the "Halloween" series from being one of the most popular of the horror film franchises. "Halloween II" in my opinion, is the best out of all the sequels and definately one of the grisliest. The original used suspense to terrorize its target audience, "Halloween II" goes straight for the jugular. Although it's not always gory, the deaths are violent and gruesome. One disgusting highlight involves a beautiful young nurse sans clothing and a scalding hot bath-tub. You do the math.<br /><br />One of the problems I had with this film is with the setting. I liked the hospital idea but "Haddonfield" memorial is a hospital I would never want to be taken to. Although the nurses are all young and attractive, the entire hospital is eerily empty. There are about 5 nurses on duty and despite having a maternity ward filled with new borns, there is no one around to attend to them. Having said that, the empty hospital was creepy and added to the overall tension. Another slight problem was with Jamie Lee Curtis' appearance. Although I loved her in the original and in this sequel, I couldn't get past the fact that she looked too old to be portraying a teenager. However, "Halloween II" would not have been the same without Curtis so I can overlook that tiny little detail and Curtis' performance is outstanding. Her Laurie Strode is one of my all-time favorite characters in a fright film.<br /><br />Despite the negatives, "Halloween II" is still a great slasher flick. It moves along at a pretty good pace and the body count is high, 2 very important factors in a horror/slasher film. Michael Myers also does his part in keeping us entertained by using very creative ways in killing off his unsuspecting victims. We're also given a back story. The connection between Laurie and Michael is finally explained. Despite this, Myers remains mysterious since the motivation behind his murderous rage is never made clear.<br /><br />"Halloween II" may not be in the same league as the classic original but it's bizarre death scenes, chilling score and Jamie Lee Curtis' gripping performance makes this the best sequel in the series. Fans of the genre will be glad Michael Myers came home.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5. Recommended.</p></body></html>

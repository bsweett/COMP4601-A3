<meta name="summary" content="Good film & acting  STOP THE ADS!!"></head><body><p>If you do NOT like advertisements in your DVDs then you will NOT want to buy this DVD.<br /><br />For the film it's self, Meryl SHOULD have won the Oscar for this 1 instead of that person where their career is being s stripper & taking their clothes off in nearly every movie they do.<br /><br />The entire cast was good in their roles, Philip as the Father, Amy as the young nun.<br />Now, Viola Davis's role was SO SMALL.  And, her character was walking asleep & did NOT care about her child.  Surprised she got an Oscar nomination for such a small role.<br /><br />Now, the DVD package--we step in to the old days of DVD's with a plain silver disc.  BORING.<br /><br />Now, the ads I mentioned before.<br />NO CHAPTER SEARCH LIST in the package, all you get are 2 ads.<br />When you input the disc it wants to show you coming attraction (ads).<br />When you start to play the movie, ANOTHER AD.  Nice way to miss it skip to the next chapter to ACTUALLY GET TO THE MOVIE OR WHAT YOU PAID FOR.</p></body></html>

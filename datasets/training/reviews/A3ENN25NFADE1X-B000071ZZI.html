The story has been done countless times, what makes this film so special is Matt Damon's acting. At times when you feel bored and want to walk out of the theater, Matt Damon gives you a surprise, he's actually acting. He adds demension to his character and some vulnerability. The dialogue isn't that bad, but it isn't in the category of "Pulp Fiction", or "Goodfellas." This is way better than the sequal, and I didn't fall asleep, so I recommend "The Bourne Identitiy."</p></body></html>

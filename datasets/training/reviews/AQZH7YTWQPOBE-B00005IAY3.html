<meta name="summary" content="The most realistic depiction of contact with aliens"></head><body><p>I hadn't watched this movie in years, but I rewatched it recently and was pleased with how well it's aged. The plot is quite simple: a group of people are inspired by UFOs to meet the aliens who changed their lives. However, the beauty is in how that simple plot is realized in the film. One thing this film gets right is its portrayal of first contact. It's a profound event. The people contacted by the aliens undergo dramatic changes in their lives. This makes the movie all the more emotionally compelling. By the end of the film, you feel like you've gone on an emotional journey as well.<br /><br /> The movie's slow pace and subtle cinematography are a nice change from most movies released nowadays. At over 2 hours, the movie crawls for most of the time presenting dialogue and images. Initially, that sounds like a recipe for disaster (or 2001 Space Odyssey) but it works really well in this context. Slowing the pace down allows viewers to feel like you're traveling with the characters and for the tension to build. It also makes the climax all the more rewarding.<br /><br />The special effects still hold up pretty well and have been improved for this 30th anniversary edition. I haven't watched this on blu-ray so I don't know how the quality holds up there. I did think some of the blacks could have been cleaned up to remove some of the "static," but I have to say it also gives the movie a nice "older" feel.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sci-fi classic and still probably the most realistic depiction of contact with aliens ever to come out of Hollywood. Too bad Hollywood just doesn't make movies like this anymore!</p></body></html>

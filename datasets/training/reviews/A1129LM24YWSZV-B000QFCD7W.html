<meta name="summary" content="Fun popcorn flick"></head><body><p>This movie was throughly entertaining. Smart casting on this film - each actor brings something very different (and a different audience) to the core group of four guys who hit the road on their motorcycles for a middle-age-crisis trip. (No wonder it did pretty well at the box office. Martin Lawrence and Tim Allen provide the "comedian" power, and Bill Macy and John Travolta have the acting cred.)<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Doug (Allen), Dudley (Macy), Woody (Travolta), and Bobby (Lawrence), four friends who get together on the weekends to ride motorcycles. Due to various things going on in each of their lives, the guys decide to take a 2,000 mile road trip to the coast together. On the way, they cement their friendships, learn more about each other and themselves, et. al.<br /><br />This was a fun ride. While the plot itself is no dynamo, the characters (and the way the actors portrayed them) made it worth watching. When Woody "accidentally" blows up a biker bar, Travolta's freak-outs are pretty dead on. Macy is, as always, soooo true.<br /><br />A fun family flick. Break out the popcorn for this one.</p></body></html>

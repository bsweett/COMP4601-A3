<meta name="summary" content="Potential Flushed Down the Toilet"></head><body><p>Two U.S marshals (Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo) are sent to investigate how a woman disappeared from her room at a remote insane asylum. While Dicaprio's character, Teddy is at Shutter Island because he thinks the man that killed his wife in a fire is there as well.<br /><br />  If the movie actually stayed on course with that plot, it would have been really good. I was thinking in the beginning of the silliest and stupidest way the movie could end and what the twist could be and....I was right!<br /><br />  It's a shame because the movie had a lot of potential due to Martin Scorsese as the director and due to the cast and the plot. The end isn't ingenious, it's just a cop out. It goes around all the questions we have about what's going on and just gives us a simple answer that doesn't even make sense.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""A warrior's ultimate act is to lay down his sword.""></head><body><p>Zhang Yimou's "Hero" is a feast for the eyes.  If there are any doubts as to the power of images and cinema's ability to astound by conveying imagery, such doubts will be erased by a viewing of this film.<br /><br />In feudal China, a warrior called Nameless (Jet Li) is taken to see the King of Qin (Daoming Chen).  The warrior is to be rewarded for dispatching three assassins - Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) - who had targeted the king.  Nameless is asked how he managed to overcome his foes and a series of stories unfold.  However, the king is not entirely convinced of the truth of the warrior's tales and offers his own interpretation of the events.<br /><br />The story of "Hero" echoes Akira Kurosawa's "Rashomon" (1950) in that the conflicting points of view keep you guessing as to the truth of the situation.  However, the narrative style employed is not the aspect of the film that will linger in your memory.  The surreal and breathtaking look of "Hero" is its most distinguishing feature.  The way in which wind, leaves, dust, water, and clothing is shot is like nothing the average filmgoer is used to seeing.  "Hero" manages to infuse the ordinary with such visual beauty that one cannot help but be hypnotized by the imagery on the screen.  Yet, do not get the impression that "Hero" is all style and no substance.  The acting is strong with Li, Chen, Yen, Leung, and Cheung all being memorable in their respective roles.  In addition, the message delivered at the end of the film is one that invites much contemplation.  Truly unique in its presentation and ambitious in aspiring to be an action tale with some food for thought, "Hero" is a film to be admired.</p></body></html>

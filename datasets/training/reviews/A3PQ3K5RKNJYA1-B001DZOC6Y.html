<meta name="summary" content="Yes, it is a Black Comedy underneath the seriousness (?)"></head><body><p>When I saw the sequence of events starting with the wind blowing the trees and then a cop shooting himself and then a driver picking up the gun and shooting himself, then a pedestrian walking by picking up the very same gun; shooting herself. Honestly, it looked like something from "MAD TV or "Saturday Night Live" - absolutely comedic. Mark Wahlberg's ditzy, airhead wife was the most annoying character of all. STUNK! STUNK!<br /><br />The reviewers who purport to be more open-minded and forgiving of this jerk M. Night Shamalaladingdong, are the kind of people who speak in esoteric terms at parties. Whatever you guys do, never travel to Filbert, Pennsylvania. You'll meet the world's worst actors reading the world's worst script. You've been warned.</p></body></html>

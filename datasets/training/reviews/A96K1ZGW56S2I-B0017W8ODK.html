<meta name="summary" content="Dream Another Dream"></head><body><p>Based upon the novel by Ian Mcewan, ATONEMENT is a beautifully shot and constructed movie that examines the power of perspective, the importance of truth, and how differences between the two can clash and affect people's lives.  The film opens in 1935 England in a beautiful country estate.  Thirteen-year old Briony Tallis (Saorise Ronan) is a precocious girl attempting to establish herself as a writer by writing tales of fantasy and plays that she and her friends can act out for their families.  Briony's older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), is in love with the son of one of the housekeepers, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), and is eager to marry and start her life anew.  Briony has a secret crush on Robbie which alters the perspective of some of the things she sees.  She thinks that there is something sinister about the flirtations between Cecilia and Robbie and when she catches them in a sudden moment of lovemaking, she believes that Robbie is a sex criminal who is attempting to hurt her sister.  That night when a young girl that is staying with the family is sexually assaulted, even though she did not see his face, Briony accuses Robbie of committing the crime.  He is arrested and taken away and the lives of Briony, Cecilia, Robbie, and all of their friends and family are horribly altered.<br /><br />The movie tells the story from two different perspectives: that of Briony's and that of what actually happened.  The story if first seen from Briony's perspective. Then after a certain sequence it rewinds to the beginning of the sequence and the audience is shown what actually happened.  This doesn't occur during the entire movie, but it does happen about four times throughout the film.  Some of the people I watched the movie with found the effect annoying, but I felt it fit with the story being told and the messages the film seems to be interested in having people discuss.<br /><br />As far as movies go, ATONEMENT is pretty much a straight drama interlaced with a bit of romance.  The plot itself isn't really interesting just by itself, but becomes intriguing when interlaced with the issue of perspective.  The acting is fairly well done and it's nice to Keira Knightley attempting to play a full-grown woman.  I was particularly impressed by the performances of James McAvoy as Robbie Turner, Saorise Ronan as the thirteen-year old Briony, and Romola Garai as the older Briony working as a nurse during WWII.<br /><br />The film's strongest points are the settings, cinematography, and editing.  The scenery is lush, vivid, and full of tones that reflect the mood and atmosphere of a particular scene.  The cinematography is amazing, particularly an extended five-and-a-half minute tracking shot take at what is supposed to be Dunkirk beach.  The set that was constructed in Redcar, England for the shot is an impressive piece of scenery and one of the most visually stunning I have seen built specifically for a movie in the past few years.  Director Joe Wright did a marvelous job of bringing it altogether.<br /><br />ATONEMENT isn't a very happy or uplifting movie.  There is very little joy in the picture and the story revolves around a girl trying to atone for the actions that disrupted her peaceful, idyllic existence and brought her into womanhood. Like some other excellent movies from 2007 (NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, THERE WILL BE BLOOD), the movie ends somewhat abruptly.  There is a sense of closure, but the audience is left at the end of the movie revaluating everything they have seen, trying to piece together what was real and what was not.<br /><br />Highly recommended for film buffs, especially those who enjoy excellent cinematography.  Also recommended for those who enjoy classy, English dramas with a bit of romance.</p></body></html>

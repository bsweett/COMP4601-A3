<meta name="summary" content="The Ultimate Hitchcock Movie"></head><body><p>This is not only the best Hitchcock film of them all but it is also the greatest scary movie of them all.  This film sparked every horror villain that ever graced the silver screen.  Mike Meyers, Scream, Freddy Cruegar, and Jason Voorhees would never have seen the spotlight had it not been for Norman Bates.  This film is very suspensful and takes you by surprise when you first watch the film.  It breaks every cliche that you would expect in a slasher flick.  See it and be terrified.  I highly reccomend it.</p></body></html>

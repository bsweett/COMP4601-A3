And that's quite an accomplishment given the quality of Bourne Identity.  This movie is fast paced, has a great plot and acting, and the action never lets up.  The fight scene with the other Treadstone agent is one of the best ever.  The HD DVD is beautiful and the sound is great.  I can't wait for the third installment in this great series.</p></body></html>

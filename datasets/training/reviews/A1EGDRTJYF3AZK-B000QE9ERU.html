<meta name="summary" content="PERVASIVE STRONG VIOLENCE!!"></head><body><p>That's no lie, in this movie you see alot of gore that you wouldn't normaly see in a mainstream movie, which was suprising given the fact it was a comic book movie.<br /><br /> The story was pretty good also, the violence served a purpose and helped move the story along. I love the fact that this "super hero" had no super powers, the only thing that motivated and helped him was blind rage, he was like the Hulk that held his human form.<br /><br /> Top notch action movie, probably not one to watch with the wife or girl friend, so all the more reason to enjoy it!!</p></body></html>

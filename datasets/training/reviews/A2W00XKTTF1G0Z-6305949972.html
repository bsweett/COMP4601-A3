<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton is Creative - This Movie is Fantastic!"></head><body><p>Tim Burton (Big Fish, Edward Scissorhands, Planet of The Apes, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory) came up with the orginal story for this clever film. His imagination is amazing.<p>This film was actually directed by Henry Selick (James and The Giant Peach, Monkeybone)who gave the agles and sequences a great deal of life, charm and magnetism.<p>The story is about the man in charge of Halloween Jack Skellington (Voiced by Chris Sarandon - Fright Night, The Princess Bride) who decides to want to try and take over the Christmas Holiday.<p>Once he realizes what Christmas is all about he discovers that he got it all wrong. With the help of his friend Sally ( Voiced by the talented Cathrine O'Hara - Best In Show, Dick Tracey, Home Alone), he realizes his mistake just when Oogie Boogie (Voiced by Ken Page - All Dogs Go To Heaven, Torch Song Trilogy) threatens to get rid of Sally and Santa Clause himself (Voiced by Ed Ivory - Eye on the Sparrow - and he is also the SINGING voice for Oogie Boogie))<p>You can also hear the talents of Paul Rubens (Pee Wee Herman) as well as William Hickey and Glenn Shadix (Planet of the Apes, Multiplicity).<p>The music is by the incredible Danny Elfman (Chicago, Men In Black, Edward Scissorhands, Hulk, Spider-Man, Planet Of The Apes) who also does the SINGING voice for Jack Skelington. Incredible writing, lyrics and performance by him. He really is a true talent. My favorite is "What's This?"<p>The DVD extra's are incredible. Making the movie and watching the detail of how each character and scene is produced. Taking three years of photography alone. The Special Edition has many features, graphics and illustrations. Every home should have this one! (12-11-03)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stongest Stephen King movie in quite a while!"></head><body><p>Pretty good horror flick based on a Stephen King story. More like 'The Shining' than his later, weak movies. Held together well by a really strong performance from John Cusack as the writer who is trapped in a really evil hotel room. Not usually my kind of movie, and yet I still liked it.</p></body></html>

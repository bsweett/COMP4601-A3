<meta name="summary" content="Master and Commander - A memorable film!"></head><body><p>This is one of those big movies that I would've dearly loved to have made it to the theaters to see but never found the time which is a bit of a personal disappointment as this film, I'm sure, would've been even that much better on the silver screen.  While this great film has it's glorious battle scenes, it is a film based not so much in big action sequences but more in the intelligent dialogue and narrative.  Few films have so aptly displayed what a harsh life sailors of this particular era lived as well as this film does.  Youthful dreams of such a life may have been deftly squashed for many by seeing the harsh realities displayed in this film.  Simply put, this film is well paced with an apt balance between intense battle scenes and almost an almost poetic script.<p>For many years now, Russell Crowe has displayed exceptional performances in several movies, showing that he has a wide range of acting abilities and this film is no exception to that as he brings Captain Jack Aubrey to life.  Paul Bettany's performance in this film is quite exceptional as well.  I believe the only other film I've seen him in was another Russell Crowe film in "A Beautiful Mind."  Clearly his future performances are to be looked forward to.  Another notable cast member is Billy Boyd, most well known for his role in "The Lord of the Rings" as Peregrin "Pippin" Took.  Although his role in this film is minor, he does stand out.<p>Director Peter Weir has had a long and storied career directing in Hollywood with such notable films as "Dead Poet's Society" and "Witness."  This film will certainly go down in the history books as one of his best.<p>The Premise:<p>The fate of the British Empire seemingly rests on the shoulders of Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) as he commands a British Naval warship that is suddenly attacked by a much larger French warship that he's been given the mission to capture or destroy.  After his first fateful encounter with the behemoth he must repair his ship and embarks on a trip spanning two oceans to capture or destroy the French ship or die in the trying...<p>What follows from there is, as stated above, an extremely well made film that in its dialogue rings to a subtle but poignant tune and its action carries the weight of a big hitter.  I highly recommend this film to any and all who enjoy films in this genre!  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>Strangely enough, the Special Features for this film seem to be somewhat of an afterthought and few at that.  Unlisted, the Special Features disc comes loosely packed and placed in the left inset.<p>-Theatrical Trailer<br />-Behind the Scenes<br />-Coming Attractions</p></body></html>

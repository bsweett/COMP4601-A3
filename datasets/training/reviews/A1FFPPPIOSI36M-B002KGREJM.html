<meta name="summary" content="Over rated movie"></head><body><p>This is a worth while flick but nothing that great. What was the big deal of the performance of Forrest Whittacker?<br /><br />What I did not like (and maybe this is not a fair comment since the movie was supposed to be historical) is that Idi Amin was not depicted as the monster that I remember publicized from 1970's. Although not a hero, for the bulk of the movie he was a little bit charming...therefore, he did not come off as a monster/evil dictator.<br /><br />The protagonist was not that innocent. His promiscuity (especially having sex with Amin's baby's mama and trying to bed his employer's wife) made him kind of deserve the enivitable wrath coming his way.<br /><br />The movie was okay but it had no more impact then a made for tv movie. I was expecting more!</p></body></html>

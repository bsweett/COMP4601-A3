<meta name="summary" content="At its core, a familiar plotline with spiffy new dressing."></head><body><p>About the only thing about &quot;Minority Report&quot; that is original is the spiffy effects.  Underneath it all, however, is an oft-used plotline:  Our rugged, honest hero is being set up for a crime he didn't commit (or, in this case, didn't commit YET), and he must go on the run and find out who is framing him and why.  Naturally, as the tried and true formula goes, his betrayer is someone close to him.  And it shouldn't be that hard to figure out the real villain once you've read the cast list or been introduced to the major players in the film.<p>It's just the same meal with a different flavor.  <p>And again, we have Spielberg pouring oodles of time and resources into another whiz-bang effects movie and plenty of extras for a DVD release.  So why can't he devote that kind of time and energy to getting the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; trilogy to your local store shelves in a more timely manner?<p>&quot;Minority Report&quot; really only impresses visually instead of emotionally.  Even if you get caught up in the story, you can't help but feel the sense of deja-vu.  If you feel you've seen this movie before, you probably have.  But &quot;Minority Report&quot; just makes it LOOK new.<p>As time goes by, this film probably won't be remembered as anything more than a reasonably big Summer 2002 box office effects extravaganza, another &quot;Ooooh, neat!&quot; movie-going experience.  It will be regarded as a really cool movie for a few more months, perhaps, then the next effects-laden thriller will come along to supplant it.<p>Don't get me wrong:  &quot;Minority Report&quot; is a decent movie, I guess.  But don't be swept away by the Flavor-of-the-Month accolades it is getting.  And after the next big Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg movie has its day in the sun, &quot;Minority Report&quot; will seem as exciting as yesterday's news.<p>&quot;Minority Report&quot; makes for a good 5 day rental from your local video store.  Rent it for all the behind-the-scenes goodies.  But if you purchase it for your home library, it will sit there like an old, forgotten impulse purchase before you know it.</p></body></html>

Second, the ending is terrible - Murray has met a young boy that might be his son. Murray repels the boy by asserting that he knows the boy is looking for his father. Boy runs off. End of movie. What was the point? 3)The entire movie, start to finish, is boring. It's about Murray looking for a woman who might have born his son 19 years ago, and at the same time that 19-year-old looking for his father.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not bad"></head><body><p>My hubby was told about Dead Silence. We never heard about it before then. So hubby went out and bought it. We watched it that night. It wasn't bad. I expected worse. But it sure isn't the scare's movie out there. At less for me. I think the end was funny. Jamie managed to not scream threw the whole movie till the end... lol.</p></body></html>

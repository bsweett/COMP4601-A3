<meta name="summary" content="Inside look at the Queen's decisions following Diana's death"></head><body><p>The movie starts with a blip over the election of Tony Blair to Prime Minister, and quickly skips forward to the horrible day that Princess Diana died.  Caught in all the media frenzy is Queen Elizabeth II, not a fan of Diana to begin with.  The Queen wishes to keep the royal family's mourning private, but the public outcry for closure forces her to come out of her privacy shell, return to the palace from their country estate, and make a public statement.<br /><br />The movie provided some private peeks into royal life, such as the queen driving herself up into the boondocks of her estate and getting her jeep stuck in a river.  A vision of the stag her grandsons are hunting leaves her with a haunting vision of its grandeur.  It's hard to image the queen doing such mundane things as driving a jeep or setting a glass of water by her bedside instead of simply snapping her fingers for water whenever she wants it.<br /><br />There's some great acting here too.  Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and the incomparable James Cromwell as Prince Philip are spectacular in their roles.  The dialogue is a bit stiff at times, but it's hard to tell if its from the scripting or on purpose because of the stiffness and formality of the royal family's, and the British elite's, communications.<br /><br />One strange thing I couldn't help noticing were the phones used as props.  Some were ancient desktop rotary phones and yet in other scenes there were modern cellular phones.  Perhaps I noticed this because I became a bit bored with the sometimes slow and stale progress of the film, but I'm sure if I decided to watch it again I would find another discrepancy.  Overall, it's a good movie to watch once.  I recommend a rent, not a purchase.  3.5 stars.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

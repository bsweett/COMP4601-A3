Alot of action, interesting story and awesome special effects and make-up. I guess some people would rather watch a film like "The Village" (which is the equivilent to watching a hampster spin around on a wheel for 2 hours).  If you like being entertained with no strings attached, "Van Helsing" delivers.  Every movie ever made doesn't have to be profound.  Film snobs will hate "Van Helsing" and scoff because it lacks such things as "irony" and "character development".  Those topics are passe and trife and cleary used a bargaining tools for the jaded film slave desperate for validation.  "Van Helsing" is an excellent film for what genre it was made for.  Horror/Thriller/Drama/Action.  It fills all of those shoes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A real throwback to the tired zombie flick"></head><body><p>Like i mentioned in my previous review for Death Proof, i have no problem with them releasing the films seperatly but my one thing is with the exclusion of the hilarious trailers. And then when i found out they weren't going to be on this DVD either, now i'm pissed off. but other then that, the movie, Planet Terror, is by far the better half of the Grindhouse feature.<br />The action takes place in a small town where a goverment faction has been conducting experiments that turn the dead into the undead. Now a small group of townsfolk must fight through the zombie hordes and make it to safty.<br />Now, this is the film i think really captured the whole Grindhouse experince. while Death Proof seemed to have given up on the whole experince about halfway through the film, Planet Terror makes full use of the whole fun of the Grindhouse. with its grainy picture, missing reels, outrageous plot elements, it was honestly one of the most fun i had at the movies.<br />Like i said before, i do hope they release the movies in one single DVD set, trailers and all, with loads of extras. But until then, for those of you who can't wait to see the films, two options. rent the two films at your video store and watch them back to back. or if you can't wait, get Planet Terror and stave of getting Death Proof until the deluxe edition comes out (if ever). I promise you, Planet Terror will have you laughing, pukeing, and at the edge of your seat all at the same time.</p></body></html>

The dream-sequences alone make this film one of the creative masterpieces of filmmaking.<br /><br />Mr. Sinatra is the tough but lovable and conscious-driven Captain out to uncover the truth no matter where it leads.  It is, perhaps, his best movie ever.  Mr. Harvey was perfect for the cold and calculating brainwashed killer.  And Ms. Lansbury is unmatched as the domineering mother.  Never can this tale be told so masterfully as with this cast and this director.  It is a one of a kind gem awaiting discovery by a new generation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hopefully the end to The Matrix phenomenon"></head><body><p>"The Matrix Revolutions" seems to me to be a little better than "The Matrix Reloaded". Maybe this is because I resigned myself to believing that the third [and hopefully final installment] would be, like "Reloaded", all whiz-bang special effects and little substance. This turned out to be a correct assumption. But not expecting much in the story department allowed me to appreciate the visuals, which are awesome. Ironically, what rules the making of both "Matrix" sequels seems to be modern machinery; in this case, digital computers. Did the filmmakers see the irony? Modern machines dictate that special effects render plot and good scripting obsolete in movies about mankind's defeat by machines? <p>This episode continues the attack of the computers/machines on the human population, which has taken refuge underground. As the machines bore through the earth relentlessly in their attack on what's left of mankind. Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and the others continue to do their best to salvage the human race. Neo, after finally meeting the ultimate machine and proposing a truce, takes on the nefarious Agent Smith in a battle that goes on and on and on. <p>I think the `problem' with the sequels is rather simple. Commerce dictated that, since the original "Matrix" was so successful, sequels should be made. In any art form, often the original product is whole within itself. How could anyone paint a sequel to The Mona Lisa? The classic movie "Casablanca" ended with a question mark, but could a "Part 2" truly have gone any further? My conclusion is that, if commerce dictates sequels, so be it, but it is foolish of us to expect them to equal, much less to exceed, the original.</p></body></html>

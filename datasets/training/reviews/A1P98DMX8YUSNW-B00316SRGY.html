<meta name="summary" content="Like an old Charles Bronson revenge flick"></head><body><p>The first two-thirds of this I thought were hilarious, though I don't suppose this is intended as a comedy. Clint's gruff old man sneers and wheezes made me laugh repeatedly. He is so miserable that it's comic. He reminds me of Charles Bronson's old 1970s "Death Wish" character, a grizzled man who sets out to take revenge at any cost. Then it slowly morphs into a PC tale about a Hmong gang in Detroit taking shots at a next door family of Hmongs that Clint befriends after first finding them annoying and repulsive. It gets a little violent at times. The Gran Torino of the title is an actual 1972 Ford that was never one of the better cars of its day. Here, because it looks pristine, there is a certain attractive quality to it. This somewhat strange feel-good movie brought an occasional tear, surprisingly.</p></body></html>

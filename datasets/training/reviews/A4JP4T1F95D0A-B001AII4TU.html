The idea is interesting enough one--the frog king dies leaving Shrek next in line to be king unless he can find a distant cousin to the king named Arthur.  The Arthurian myths are only barely touched despite the presence of Arthur and Merlin.  I think they dropped the ball with that one.  I laughed at a few scenes with the Gingerbread Man, but overall this one lacked the charm of the other films.  Maybe the characters are getting stale, or maybe the writing wasn't up to snuff.  I will probably buy this one to go with the first two, but on its' own it is a toss up.</p></body></html>

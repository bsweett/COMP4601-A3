Quickly I would like to point out 3 things.<br /><br />The crime and rescue scenes are wonderful. However, none of them gave me the chills like in the 1978 film, when Superman saves Lois Lane from falling to her death off the skyscraper and also catches the helicopter at the same time and lifts it back up, as the theme song blares when he catches the helicopter. To me that is the greatest movie scene in history.<br /><br />The new Lois doesn't measure up to Margot Kidder's quirky performance. Margot was beautiful in her own way and her character is what made the character so great. Seems like Margot didn't go for the glamorous side of Lois, but focused on giving her character. Kate Bosworth seems like she would freak if her hair got messed up while flying with Superman. Yawn.<br /><br />Finally, some of the scenes from the 1978 film that showed Superman landing and taking off seemed more real. Because he was suspended on wires and there were no special effects involved. the new one totally uses FX and it looks kinda fake. They should have stuck with the wiring.<br /><br />Still, it is a great film and I can't wait for sequels.</p></body></html>

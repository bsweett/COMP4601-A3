The acting is superb, along with the screenwriting, special fx and music. If you like films like "The Matrix" "Van Helsing" and "X-Men" you're going to love this film. The character interaction between Michael and Selene is simply beautiful, (and very well conceived.) If ever there were a time to like a film about vampires and werewolves, it's now. Buy all three of these films now!!</p></body></html>

Jennifer Aniston is not someone I've ever found particularly appealing (either looks or acting-wise), so Clive going for her while he had a faithful Melissa George at home didn't make a lot of sense to me. Ah, but then there was a truly menacing performance by Vincent Cassel that made me forget any such quibbles and fall hook, line and sinker for the plot. All in all, a much better movie than I was expecting.</p></body></html>

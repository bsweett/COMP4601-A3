<meta name="summary" content="MORE PORN THAN TERROR 6.5 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>Hostel is definitely one of those movies that no matter what kind of parent you are, this movie is in no way appropriate for kids at all. My big complaint against this movie is the fact it focuses more on pornography than the purpose it's suppose to serve... to scare you. While it's always gratifying to see naked chicks, this movie takes it too far to the point of where you just get tired of looking at them(I've seen enough movies with this already). The gore and level of violence is definitely disturbing and it will really gross you out. It never scared me because I've seen enough horror movies to know what will probably happen, so that partially ruined the experience as well. The characters are basically a group of foul-mouthed people or they are mentally disturbed which didn't really pull me into the storyline either. And the nudity involving the dudes? What was up with that? Seriously folks, it's really nasty.</p></body></html>

But what i will do is discuss the DVD, which most of the time the only info I really want to know.<p>OK, first of all the picture quality is EXCELLENT.  In fact, it's so good that it looks as if it were filmed just yesterday.  (Except for the occasional Gremlin you see in the film, LOL!)  But anyway, the DVD case states that it was transfered from a HD master and it shows.<p>However the new 5.1 soundtrack is not bad, but you can tell that it's all new as to everything hasn't been &quot;stereo-ized&quot;.  For example, in the police station scene where Arnold is walking through and shooting everybody he sees his guns, there are instances when the gun sounds are in stereo in one shot and then not in another while in both instances they should be as they fire to the left or right.  Also the sound is really bad during the film's numerous car chases where the most dominant sound is the music while the car sounds are barely audible and then all of a sudden you get a sound in the left or right channel when the car hits something or makes a powerslide around a corner.  But...what can you expect from a soundtrack that was originally just Monoaral.<p>One note though, since I don't have a true surround sound system, that above complaint may not be as bad as I made it out to be.  (I have a TV with simulated surround and a 2 speaker stereo that has SRS sound)<p>But as for the Bonus Features, that's where you get your money's worth.  First of all it has several deleted scenes w/ or w/o commentary, all of which are in as good as shape visually as the Feature.  Second of all it comes with 2 really great documentaries.  &quot;The Terminator: A Retrospective&quot; that was shot in '92 (a year after T2) that's OK, but not too indepth, and &quot;Other Voices&quot; that is brand new that really goes into the making of the film that mirrors in quality the documentary that's on the T2: Ultimate Edition.<p>The Menu Navigation is also very cool which sort of takes you through several &quot;Cyberdyne&quot; animations.<p>So if you're looking to complete your Terminator DVD collection as I did after already owning T2, grab this one as it's the best version we'll have for a while, or forever.<p>Oh, one more thing about the sound.  They have changed the sound of the Flying HKs.  They no longer have that strange screaming robotic sound.  They now have a jetliner sound, which may or maynot sound more realistic to you.  In fact all of the Future War sequences have been totally revamped sonically.</p></body></html>

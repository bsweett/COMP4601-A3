And here's why: bad guys and good guys, no "nuanced" portrayal, and ... worst of all ... there are Christians in the movie who are not wacky, homicidal, perverse, sadistic, or hypocritical! It's Hollywood's worst nightmare, and certainly not a movie I would have expected to see these days. I can't imagine what must have been going through Stallone's head to be making this movie. I wish this DVD had a commentary or some special feature to shed some light on this.<br /><br />What can I say? It's a beautifully shot (color-wise, that is) ballet of brutality, post-Saving Private Ryan. Not for the faint of heart. The pacing is perfect, the violence is horrible, when inflicted by Burmese militia upon innocents, and cathartic, when they're themselves shredded into bloody bits.<br /><br />I had read criticisms to the effect that the bad guys were portrayed as "faceless" cannon fodder. Not true. They are portrayed as psychopathic, sadistic rapists and murdererers, and this is the true face of evil: boring as hell. It's why modern portrayals of villains, such as Wesley Snipes' character in Demolition Man, are surprisingly boring: you know they'll shoot their buddy in the head at the drop of a hat, just to show they're really bad. When it happens, big yawn. In the end, all really evil men look the same, devoid of what makes them truly unique or human. Faceless.<br /><br />It's a reminder that out there are evil men with guns, ready to wreak havoc upon whomever they will, and that they will not be stopped by appeals to conscience. And it's a tribute to the soldier who defends the weak, perhaps at the cost of his own soul. In other words, a world totally alien to the progressive mindset of today.<br /><br />Horrible things are happening in the world, and they're screaming cluelessly about ... carbon footprints. (Even though last year's temperature drop alone was enough to "wipe out" all the "warming" of the last decade ... hilarious!) Under Saddam, husbands were kidnapped by the government and returned in pieces, or fed into shredders, and whole villages were wiped out with poison gas, and they're screaming about ... outlawing plastic bags and trans-fats and SUVs.<br /><br />What can I say? I enjoyed this film immensely. It's sad when it takes John Rambo to remind us what's really going on and what really matters.</p></body></html>

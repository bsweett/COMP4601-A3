<meta name="summary" content="Terry George's masterful recounting of the Rwandan genocide"></head><body><p>Terry George's "Hotel Rwanda" ought to be mandatory viewing for all United States citizens who see the Rwandan genocide as something remote that happened 'over there' to a class of people whose lives somehow don't matter as much as ours do.<br /><br />The triumph of the film is that the actors - most notably leads Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo - humanize the recounting to the extent where it resonates with its audience on a personal level.  In contrast, stories where the audience is told "and X thousand people were slaughtered" tend to get marginalized.  It's maddening, but it's the reality.  Credit director George for recognizing this truth and latching on to a great way to relate the true extent of this tragedy.<br /><br />My suggestion is to pair "Hotel Rwanda" with a viewing of HBO's harsher, more in-your-face "Sometimes in April."  Think of it as an inside-outside combination: in "Rwanda," you're inside the Hotel Mille Coline (in capital city Kigali) looking out; in "April," you're outside the hotel trying to get in.  The result of viewing the two films is to give you a compelling 360-degree view of these shocking sequence of events.</p></body></html>

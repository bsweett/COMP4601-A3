Upon first viewing I couldn't distinguish what the heck was going on, why certain characters were doing what they were doing, and what the villin's main purpose was. After my second viewing I started to understand the plot a lot more and I became interested. I can't say "Dead Silence" is my favorite thriller or even on my Top 10 list of scary films, but it's an OK movie.<br /><br /> The plot basically deals with dolls, one in particular named Billy, who kills a guy's wife when he finds the doll outside their apartment. He eventually goes to bury his wife in a small town and brings the doll with him to understand its origins. The doll was part of a 1940's act called "Mary Shaw and Billy". Mary was a ventriloquist who collected 101 dolls and upon her death she basically became some sort of ghost that led Billy to killing people.<br /><br /> The actress playing Mary Shaw, Judith Roberts, gave me the absolute chills. A woman of at least 75 her voice is creepy and her body movements unsettling so she is a nice asset to an otherwise medicore movie.<br /><br /> "Dead Silence" was written and produced by the same team who made the "Saw" franchise, but this film was by no means a hit. Most critics and fans hated it and the movie only grossed $22,000,000 on a $20,000,000 budget.</p></body></html>

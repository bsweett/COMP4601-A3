<meta name="summary" content="Quite possibly the strangest film ever made"></head><body><p>How Being John Malkovitch was ever made I'll never understand. It is so bizarre, different, clever and out-there that no production company should have ever approved it. Yet they did, and for that I am ever so grateful.<p>Just the story synopsis sounds so crazy. A puppeteer working on the 7 1/2 floor (originally built for midgets) finds a portal leading to the head of real life actor John Malkovitch, allowing annoying entering it to be Malkovitch for 15 minutes before being spit out on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Wow. And the movie is so much more weird then that. The first time I saw it, my mouth was wide open in shock. How did this movie get made? It's so crazy it's wonderful.<p>With such a the head-trip of a story, it's easy to skip over the wonderful performances by the cast. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz look and act positively convincing as a poor, ugly and strange couple in New York. Catherine Keener is superb as a power-hungry, greedy woman who Cusack and Diaz both fall for, and of course Malkovitch as himself is both strange and intoxicating. Is it how he really acts? You never really know. And that's part of the charm of this wonderful film. The line of reality and fiction at times becomes fuzzy. A characteristic that writer Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze play even more with in their follow-up Adaptation.<p>Of course, all this weirdness means this film isn't for everyone. Some will scoff at it's "too cleverness" or walk out thoroughly confused. But for those who love the theater of the absurd, this will be pure paradise. One of the most unique and memorable films to come out under the Hollywood radar in a long time. This gets my high recommendation.</p></body></html>

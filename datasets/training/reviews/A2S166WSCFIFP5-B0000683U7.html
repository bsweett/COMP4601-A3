<meta name="summary" content="?&iquest;?I?&iquest;?ve got a job, a secretary, a mother,  ...."></head><body><p>...  two ex-wives, and several bartenders dependent on me.&#65533; (Carey Grant) <p>This movie has it all. A great (original) script by Ernest Lehman. One of Bernard Hermann&#65533;s scores. James Mason playing a sinister villain.  Martin Landau and even more chilling villain and in his strongest performance in a supporting role. Eva Marie Saint (who I wouldn&#65533;t have picked for the female lead, but then that&#65533;s why I&#65533;m not the one making movies this good) at her sultry best. Carey Grant, always debonair, the very picture of suave, in the best role he ever had. And the best filmmaker ever: Alfred Hitchcock. There&#65533;s the one-liners that only Grant can deliver. Humor. Drama. Suspense. There&#65533;s a murder in the UN. A chase in a cornfield by a bi-plane, which is one of the most famous chase scenes. And a fight across Mount Rushmore. The Hitchcock film to end all Hitchcock films.<p>I&#65533;ve seen DVD&#65533;s that contain more extras and I&#65533;ve seen DVDs that contain less. This has some 50 production stills, the tv trailer, the theatrical trailer, and the Hitchcock trailer. There is a 40 minute documentary on the making of the movie. The documentary just covers the basics, so don&#65533;t expect all the hard details, but it&#65533;s worth watching. Unfortunately neither Hitch nor Carey Grant were around to do a commentary, so the next best thing, Ernest Lehman, did the commentary. Actually, it turns out that his interview for the making of documentary (in its less edited form)  is what&#65533;s laid out over the movie. Which might explain why there are large gaps of no commentary and why there aren&#65533;t as many insights as to why he wrote a scene one way versus another. You do get some colorful stories about Hitch and the making of this movie, and at one point Lehman goes into detail about the writing of the script. It&#65533;s not the best commentary I&#65533;ve seen, but worthwhile. There is also a music only track for the serious student of Hitchcock. It&#65533;s probably not something anyone other than a film student is going to watch (over two hours with no dialogue and at times no music takes a certain level of commitment). But if you want to see just how effective Hermann&#65533;s score is, there is no better way to do it. <p>North By Northwest is one of my favorite movies and one of the best movies ever made. The DVD isn&#65533;t spectacular but it does contain a few perks.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better Than INSURECTION, But Not As Good As FIrst Contact!"></head><body><p>STAR TREK X: NEMISIS is the supposed last of the Star Trek films in the 36 year history of Star Trek originally conceived by Gene Roddenberry (Andromeda, Earth:Final Conflict) back in 1964. Directed by Stuart Baird (Executive Decision, US MArshals) the film has a dark tone. This film is definitely more interesting than the last installment (Insurrection), but not quiet as good as First Contact. I think the tone of the film is what missed its mark for me. There was too much talking between Shinzon played by ??? (  ) and Captain Picard played by the always brilliant Patrick Stewart ( ) and exposition and not enough for the other characters to do.<p>The star for this film was Data, played by Brent Spinner (Out To Sea, The Master Of Disguise ) playing a duel role as the ever misfitted android and an duplicate "brother" called B4. The scenes of his light-hearted humor, curiosity, quick wit and heroism make this film very enjoyable. Problem because Brent was also one of the three who came up with the story idea as well with producer Rick Berman (Enterprise, Deep Space Nine, Voyager) and screenwriter John Logan (Gladiator, The TimeMachine, Any Given Sunday).<p>The story is simple - but a little weird. Captain Picard was cloned by the Romulans (the Bad Guys) in order to be replaced in the Federation an infiltrate the "Good Guys". Due to a change of politics and governments - the plan was abandoned and the clone grew up under hardship to become the future destructor of planet Earth. Yawn....<p>Now the real action takes place more than half-way into the movie where Shinzon's ship gets rammed by the Enterprise. From that point the forward the movie is a roller coaster. And, thanks to Data, who destroys the most deadliest weapon known in the Universe - the Earth is saved. Data even has a moment where the audience cheered!<p>The supporting cast gets second seat in this film and even Jonathan Frakes (Clockstoppers, Thunderbirds ) gets a decent fight scene in this, but not a great contributor to the plot overall. Mr. Frakes did a great job directing First Contact.<p>There are cute scenes, wedding reception scenes, love making scenes, there is even some off-roading too  - but over-all it takes the last 40 minutes to get you involved. Also there is an emotional ending that may shock Star Trek fans - the two who didn't know anything about it. <p>The score is by the incredible Jerry Goldsmith ( ) and the special effects are top notch and completely believable. Overall Star Trek fans should be satisfied and the non Trekker will enjoy the detailed ending - just wished it had me humor and more for the other characters to do. Go see it and tell me what you think! (12-22-02) 3x</p></body></html>

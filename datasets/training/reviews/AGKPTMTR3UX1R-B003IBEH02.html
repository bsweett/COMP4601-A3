<meta name="summary" content=""My name is Susie Salmon. Like the fish.""></head><body><p>Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is the fourteen year old heroine of the unusual, moving film. She is killed by a neighborhood predator after being lured into his secret lair.<br /><br />At first, Susie is not aware that she's dead. She comes to a slow realization of this fact as she is drawn deeper into the world she now inhabits, a fantastic, seemingly perfect Limbo, where she is awed and moved by the otherworldly sights she sees.<br /><br />She is alternately terrified by her own dawning awareness of her hideous murder. She can also see the world and life she has left behind, and is deeply saddened by the agony her family suffers in her absence.<br /><br />THE LOVELY BONES is deeply spiritual, and deeply engaging, but it is also deeply disturbing. It is a thought-provoking film, with a great many strengths, not least of which is the coltishly pretty, ethereal Ms. Ronan in the lead, who carries this difficult role very confidently on her young shoulders.<br /><br />This was Peter Jackson's "art" film, a film he could only create after his spectacular commercial success with THE LORD OF THE RINGS. THE LOVELY BONES, surprisingly, has some elements in common with the trilogy. It's depiction of "heaven" is a bright, calm pastoral fantasy, punctuated by the darkness and fear of the murder scenes.<br /><br />THE LOVELY BONES is the type of film that stays with you after even one viewing. It, however, lacks the kind of "entertainment value" which causes people to buy DVDs. Very few people will say to the family, "Hey! Let's watch that movie about the murdered girl again tonight! Anybody up for it?" though it might be the kind of film a family coping with loss might watch for comfort and openhearted communication.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Punch drunk film staggers across the screen"></head><body><p>I wasn't sure what I was watching: an adoring public saying good-bye to ex-champ Rocky Balboa, or Sylvester Stallone in an embarrassing plea for relevance or redemption. In the end, I think it was the latter. The telling clue was in Paulie's speech to Rocky before Rocky entered the ring. Paulie said (and I paraphrase), "tonight get it out of your system once and for all". He was referring to the stuff that Rocky said was in his "basement", the anger that he had in his gut. As Stallone wrote the screenplay, I think he was talking to himself. I wonder what speech he'll give as John Rambo in the upcoming "John Rambo" movie that's filming. (I'll never know, and I won't miss it.)<br /><br />All art must pass the test of credibility and this failed. Rocky, a punch-drunk pugilist morphed into a dime store philosopher. It felt as if Stallone was reaching back for the easy dialogue of the first Rocky film - still a classic IMO. That easy dialogue was written thirty years ago, though, and this time around it didn't come easy. Stallone is a different person, and therefore a different writer. People grow; they change. Yet here he presents us with yet another Rocky film, with a main character desperate *not* to change. (We may as well be speaking of Stallone himself.) A Rocky that wants to get back into the ring, relive his glory days, get whatever he didn't get out of his gut the first time around when he lost a staggering and entirely unbelievable twenty-three fights. A Stallone desperate to...yeah, I've said that already.<br /><br />The vehicle Stallone chooses as Rocky's spark is absurd. ESPN does a "cartoon" simulation of a fight between the current heavyweight champion (Mason "the Line" Dixon, played by Antonion Tarver who is a former light-heavyweight champion and has a few grand delusions of his own), and the simulation predicts that Rocky would win. In the real world, this wouldn't have raised more than an eyebrow. In Stallone's world, in whatever illogical, deranged universe he has placed Rocky in, this grew to an exhibition pay-per-view fight worth millions held in Las Vegas, where nobody goes to lose.<br /><br />An exhibition PPV? Who are they kidding? I understand that this is fiction and that suspension of disbelief is expected, but this is absurd. I'm a boxing, er, fan, I suppose. A reluctant fan in that I don't enjoy the violence but do enjoy the competition. My point? I know the game, and I can state with absolute certainty that an exhibition PPV between a young, strong champion and an aging (50s!) fighter who has shown signs of brain damage in previous films would never be sanctioned. For that matter, no fight between said combatants would be sanctioned anywhere in the U.S.A.<br /><br />I will give the film this: it used a real boxing promoter (Lou diBella, and also showed the production flag for De La Hoya's company, Golden Boy Promotions), real boxing commentators (all from HBO: Max Kellerman, Larry Merchant, and Jim Lampley), a real ring announcer (Michael Buffer - "Let's get ready to rumble!"), a real referee (Joe Cortez), and the weigh-in official was the Nevada State boxing commissioner (Marc Ratner). Mike Tyson even made a punk appearance, showing up at the fight and calling out Dixon. There were others, too, such as the commentators from ESPN (Brian Kenney).<br /><br />I heard that the fight choreography was going to be superb. It wasn't. The punches looked no more real than they ever have, and the beatings that each fighter took were impossibly brutal. In this film, Rocky is over fifty years old. Any referee, *especially* Joe Cortez, would have stopped the fight in the second round when the fifty-year-old contender is knocked down twice and severely wobbled several other times. Rocky still hasn't learned to keep his gloves up so he's quite literally a human punching bag. I wonder if there's a metaphor in that last sentence for Stallone.<br /><br />Let's hope that Stallone is finished with Rocky. I am.</p></body></html>

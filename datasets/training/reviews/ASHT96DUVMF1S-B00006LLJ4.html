His time and effort for depicting the future with his weekend think tank with some of the great minds in many different areas made of a convincing movie.  I love how computer enable directors to bring realistic dreams to the movie screen.  The story is just as incredible.  It reminds me of the old Twilight Zones or a great Alfred Hitchcock.  The picture is great on this DVD.  Using a type of desaturation a crisp blue formed.  The special Features found on disc two are amazing. My biggest problem with many DVD's is the lack of cooperation by the director and cast.  Here Stephen Spielberg takes his time to explain his vision along with his other constituents. This is a buy.  You will not be disappointed.  The man delivers again with a breath taking film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Shocking!  Mind-Blowing!  Classic Kubrick!"></head><body><p>This movie is truly timeless and although certain elements betray its age e.g. use of cassettes in the future instead of cds, use of a typewriter instead of a desktop pc by the writer etc, this film transcends time and its message is still very thought-provoking and evokes strong responses from viewers just like modern avant-garde artworks are supposed to.  From "Dr. Strangelove" to "2001: A Space Odyssey" to this, Stanley Kubrick's brilliant directing genius can only be described as producing cinematic high works of art.  Just like in the great "2001:...", Kubrick forces you to think about serious issues, stunning and shocking you to come to your own conclusions and to stimulate your senses all the while refusing to tell you what to think.<br /><br />Some may feel Alex got off too easy and for all his major offences against society should be severely punished ala capital punishment and may actually come to this conclusion from watching the film.  Others may actually feel sorry for and happy for Alex that he returns to "normal" and that the powers that be get what they deserve with the threat of a loss of power.  Either way, the film disturbs you enough to elicit strong responses making it difficult to remain indifferent or to not have an opinion which is the definition of good modern art.<br /><br />This film could also be a metaphor for thought control and governance asking the question: is it proper to force people to accept an ideology even if they don't truly believe it themselves?  Whether it is Communism or even Capitalism or any religion should people be given a choice which one to go with or should society take all steps to penalise even to the point of using physical pain and suffering to ensure compliance?  It is telling at the end when Alex becomes "healed" only when he realises that the very powers that are trying to "heal" him are sick and maybe even sicker than he is; a different sort of corruption but corruption nonetheless.<br /><br />This film as time has shown is the true winner of the Oscar for the Best Picture, Director and Actor awards for that year and how "The French Connection" won for these categories is beyond belief.  This film is certainly a lot more rewarding on so many levels and has certainly aged a lot better to rank among the best ever films.<br /><br />The great news is that the digital restoration and remastering has been done very well making both the picture and sound quality of this dvd very, very good indeed.  Although the Special Features are nothing to speak about, I'm hoping the newly-released Blu-Ray version will have extras such as making-of and other sorts of documentaries as well.<br /><br />By far a film masterpiece by the great Kubrick and a must-have for every film buff's dvd library.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

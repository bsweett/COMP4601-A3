<meta name="summary" content="So This is What OCD Is..."></head><body><p>I'd not seen this celebrated movie until very recently.<br /><br />It wears very, very well after almost ten years.  The cast is mismatched, to be sure:  placing a heavyweight like Jack Nocholson alongside Helen (who?) Hunt and Greg Kinnear would seem funny itself if it wasn't exactly what they did.  And the writing is much, much better than OK.<br /><br />My reflection, though, is on how media portry OCD.  "Monk" has given tv viewers a sense of the disease as played out by the title character.  It almost seems as though Monk's OCD helps him solve cases and is better at his job.<br /><br />This film focuses more on OCD as a disease, which is what it is.  Nicholson is successful and productive, but deeply unhappy and chained to his disorder. The "salvation" depicted in this movie is how personal relationships can help an enslaved person escape the bonds of OCD.<br /><br />It's a great movie with great performances, and was drenched with Oscars as a result.  What may be overlooked, though, is how we learn, almost unconsciously, about a real human disease.<br /><br />You'll love it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Blu Ray Reaction"></head><body><p>The Exorcist is a timeless classic and obviously the best way to see it is in HD.  Still, Blu Ray releases can sometimes (very rarely, but occasionally) be less-than-impressive or not especially brilliant in comparison to similar DVD releases.<br /><br />Luckily, there's nothing to worry about. The new transfer of The Exorcist kept me awe-struck through the whole thing, a showcase of brilliant clarity and detail that no generation has ever been able to experience at home.  Every scene was deliciously glossy and had that 3D depth about it that makes Blu Ray fanatics giddy with delight.  This release is a classic example of the magic of 1080p and is absolutely worth the DVD upgrade.  Also, it's great to see that it includes both the original theatrical edition and extended director's cut.  (The original is better IMO, but I usually watch the Extended just to experience as much as possible) and crammed with a bunch of interesting extras including audio commentary and a 30 minute bit about the filming of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, if you're an Exorcist fan and are questioning whether or not this HD release is worth getting, rest assured it is.  The picture and audio quality are top notch and obviously restored with diligence and care.  If you've somehow never seen the movie before, now's the time to do it. Blu Ray gives this nearly 40 year old movie a glossy, young look that is just as stunning in appearance as any recent blockbuster.  I will say, however, that if you really want to experience the complexity and brilliance of the story in its full glory, you should look into reading William Peter Blatty's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061007226">original book</a>.  It's by far scarier and more shocking than the movie, in my opinion, and fans should definitely check it out.</p></body></html>

Generally, to earn five stars from me, it has to be a movie that I could see many times, even in one week. This movie does not qualify for that. Although it is very good, I can only watch it once every six months or so. However, since it really is good, it should qualify as five stars, especially compared to other four star movies.<p>The acting is good, the cinematography is great, the transfer is very good (especially considering it was one of the early DVDs to hit the market) and the special effects are good enough that you hardly notice them (which is what I consider good -- you don't notice that they are there).<p>The suspense is high in that you don't know if he will get caught (no, I won't tell you). There are small surprises at every turn, but not enough depth to bear rapid repeat viewings. Still, it is one of the modern day classics, so give it a try.</p></body></html>

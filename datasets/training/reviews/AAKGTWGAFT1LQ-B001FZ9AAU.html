<meta name="summary" content="Iron Man has it all - acting, story, effects, humour and drama"></head><body><p>I'm very glad that Robert Downey, Jr got his act together.<br />It is largely because he did that we have this film. He holds it on his shoulders ably.<br />Like other comic book based movies, I don't care about the source material at all.<br />The only question : Is the movie entertaining - yes it is, in fact is for that reason that I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />This movie is a master class in acting from Robert - whether that be comic or dramatic.<br />What other lead actor could play Tony Stark? Granted, that is an easy question, as there are not that many real 'actors' out there at the moment.<br />The reason I say this is that Robert has to play an unsympathetic yet occasionally charming and intelligent man.<br />This in itself is a challenge - which he rises to admirably.<br />People have to work with him, but they don't have to like him - in fact, that does lead to problems for the character.<br />Of course the supporting cast are right there with him - at or near his ability level.<br /><br />The last line of the film is delivered perfectly by Robert and leads in to the next movie.<br />The last line is perfect because everything previous to it leads there logically - it is the only possible culmination in the film's world. You are left hanging on with a sense of anticipation, yet you laugh as well.<br /><br />Perhaps one day we will see a Director's Cut of this, though I won't be surprised if we don't, as it is perfect.<br /><br />If I could add one thing to this Blu-Ray set, it would be a commentary by the director and stars.<br />Very highly recommended.</p></body></html>

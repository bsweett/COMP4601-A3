<meta name="summary" content="BOY - WAS THIS ONE NOT UP TO PAR."></head><body><p>After listening to the commentary [to understand the movie] I can see how this "legend" got skrewed up.<br /><br />on the whole:<br />5 stars for color of the out of doors.<br />1 star for the dark images<br />4 stars for the characters.<br />5 stars for what I could see of the Aliens and "Chet" the Predalian and "Wolf" the preditor.<br />Chet and Wolf were nothing but dark blobs on the screen.  Hey, these guys were [or should have been] good looking.<br />NO STARS for the hosptial scenes.<br />The commentary guys should keep their effing language out of the film,<br />just tooo adulescent.<br />Come on, Strauses, the kids wanted to see this movie.  This is the worst one of the group.  Couldn't even see our guys.  Who was who?<br />Definitely in keeping with the fourth Alien [didn't care for that one either] #4's must be unlucky.<br /><br />Very disappointed.</p></body></html>

Well I was just disappointed with what they did here.  Why they had to change so many things from the original story is beyond me.  I mean, was it going to hurt that many feelings to show the oppresive left wing government that the original story was about?  Of course, so lets make it PC, show anything not far left as fanatical with untrue labels, and make it right wing bad!  That way we please all the liberals who are running Hollywood!  And then they can have Brokeback Mountain AND V for Vendetta for under 30 dollars!  So sad that so many of the sheeple just wander around eating it up hook, line and sinker.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is great but I just felt so sorry for so many of them in this film because the story was bastardized for political purposes.</p></body></html>

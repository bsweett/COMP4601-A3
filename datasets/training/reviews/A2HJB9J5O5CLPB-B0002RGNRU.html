<meta name="summary" content="Good Memory"></head><body><p>After watching a dozen European and Asian films, films like: In The Mood for Love and Love and Lucida, I was ready for good old American filmmaking.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind isn't overly technical with color and technical innovation, but it does have the greatest screenplay writer in the world, the great Charlie Kaufman.  Here is a writer as legendary as any actor or director. Look him up on Goggle and you'll see his amazing story.<br /><br />Jim Carey (Joel) is a likable slump and Kate Winslet (Clementine) is the pretty but troubled wild girl.  They meet, they love, they screw up, they hate each other, and they break up.  Then Tom Wilkinson, the brain doctor, erases their memory of each other.  We suspend belief because the script goes a little science fiction with the medical procedure that erases bad memories, humiliations, foolish fears, or any other unpleasantness of a lifetime.  During the procedure Joel changes his mind and he rebuilds his psyche in order to retrieve the magic in love.<br /><br />There is a secondary story.  Kirsten Dunst is playing her first adult role, a doctors' receptionist.  Her memory is erased also, so that she doesn't wreck Wilkerson's marriage.  Hmm, I see this is getting difficult to explain.  Know that this film had a decent emotional punch.  Loving another person is very difficult over a long period.  Not everyone gets the hang of it.  After all, it takes two to tango.  Paraphrasing the philosopher, Nietche:  Lucky is the human who remembers none of his or her blunders.  They are the happiest of them all.  Freud would have more to say, but I digress.</p></body></html>

His latest breaking news asignment is the uveiling of the town groundhog in punksatoni county. It's total dullsville for him. He hates the cheery townies and all their townie traditions.<br /><br />But, on the brighter side, he figures all will be well when he gets back home to his ego-engulfed uninteresting life.<br /><br />Now, everyday (or rather, every same day.) he wakes up to find that he's re-living the same day over and over again. He can't help but be puzzled at first but now, as if by some damnation, he's forced to live the same day over and over till he gets it right.<br /><br />Filled with laughs, drama, cherry moments and an awful lot of Bill Murray's classic Sarcastic comedy.<br /><br />This movie is a big favorite of mine. It's something different. It's something unique. And the message it sends is pretty clear.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

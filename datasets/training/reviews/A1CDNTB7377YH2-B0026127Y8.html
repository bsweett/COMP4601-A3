<meta name="summary" content="Neeson gives good Jason Bourne-like Performance"></head><body><p>Neeson is excellent as a government operative who is divorced and is still trying to make amends to his teenage daughter for not being there for her during many of her formative years.  He is very protective for her because of his training Thus he is extremely adverse to his daughter going with a friend to Paris for a vacation.<br /><br />At first he totally refuses to give her permission but is pressure by both his daughter and ex-wife to sign the permission slip.  Of course the actual plans that the daughter has once she gets there is different.  She and her girlfriend let a stranger ride with them in a cab from the airport and it leads to a bunch of men breaking into the apartment where she is staying.<br /><br />The daughter manages to call her father as the men break in and her tells her what is going to happen but if she follows his instructions, he will hopefully be able to find her.  The men take both girls and one actually taunts Neeson on the phone.  Neeson promises the attacker that he will track him down and kill him.<br /><br />Neeson then dons a "Jason Bourne" personna and goes to Paris to find his daughter.  He is in a desperate race against the clock because that he is told that if he doesn't find her in 96 hours, it will be impossible to ever locate her.<br /><br />Great action scenes and Neeson is relentless in his chase.  Though this movie has a lot of predictability it is still fun and Neeson does a good job playing his part.  An above average thriller!</p></body></html>

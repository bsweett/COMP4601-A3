<meta name="summary" content="In 1539 The Knights Templar of Malta..."></head><body><p>...paid tribute to Charles V of Spain, by sending him A Golden Falcon encrusted from beak to claw with rarest jewels..."<br /><br />The Falcon was lost in time.<br />Our mystery begins when a beautiful but enigmatic woman (Mary Astor) shows up at the Spade and Archer detective agency. She gives them a story that is implausible; however they are well paid. This leads to the death of Archer.<br /><br />Who did it and why? The police suspect Sam Spade.<br />Who do you suspect?<br /><br />As the story unfolds many interesting characters (suspects) show up and the story takes different turns as the mystery of the missing black bird continues.<br /><br />I will not go through the whole story However there is many well know actors and Hammett dialog.<br /><br />For readers you are in for a treat as the movie follows the book pretty well with a few exceptions as the absence of Gutman's daughter.<br /><br />Be sure to view the earlier version of this story "Dangerous Female" (1931); you will get a different view.<br />Sam Spade (Ricardo Cortez)<br />Ruth Wonderly (Bebe Daniels)<br /><br />There are a few films that are variations of this one but they are comparatively inferior.<br /><br />The film its self comes in many packages from multiple DVD's to Blu-ray. Each has its advantage and disadvantages. However it is the basic presentation that I am reviewing as that is the classic.</p></body></html>

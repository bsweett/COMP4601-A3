<meta name="summary" content="George Romero You Are Still The King"></head><body><p>The original "Dawn of the Dead" still reigns supreme as do films like 28 Days Later - even dare I say it Resident Evil in comparison to this awful half baked MTV borefest.  The film opens promisingly (albeit this only about 5-10 minutes in and that is including the stylishly effective credit sequence with Johnny Cash singing) and then goes completely downhill with characters you could care less about (some of these people are so grating you will want to destroy your television set in total anger), and a shocking absence of any action, suspense or detail in place and atmosphere for thirty or so minutes of the film before it goes into all the blood and carnage which I'm sorry to say isn't really all that as many of these reviewers have said...I have seen much better and on a much smaller budget.  And what is Zack Snyder, the director's obsession with so many shots of falling shotgun rounds...Gets really tedious after the fiftieth time. This is an overproduced film with a terrible script and no sense of focus and believability.  The original film grabbed you in your gut on a purely visceral level as well as stimulating your mind intellectually from a satiric and apocalyptic point of view.  Romero's film had something to say...This remake or repossession as I care to think of it in this case has nothing to say and really doesn't entertain at all.  It's like watching a slow motion car wreck but on that show Real TV with two crash test dummies in the driver's seat while really terrible music and dated 70's music like Christopher Cross is playing in the background.</p></body></html>

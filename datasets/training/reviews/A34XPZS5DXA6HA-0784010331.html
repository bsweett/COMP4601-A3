<meta name="summary" content="Wow!  It kept me guessing...."></head><body><p>I really enjoyed this film.  I was throughly grossed out, but intrigued by the scene where the elevator removes the arms of a man, and I thought the scene where Arnold becomes a woman trying to pass through customs was hilarious.  This movie had tons of action, and I couldn't figure out whether Arnold was still in recall or wether he was back in &quot;the real world&quot;.  In fact, I still haven't figured it out.  If anyone else has let me know.</p></body></html>

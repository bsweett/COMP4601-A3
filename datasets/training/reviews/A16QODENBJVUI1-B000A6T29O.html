<meta name="summary" content="Loved Angelina, but not the film"></head><body><p>I have to confess that I liked a number of moments in this film, despite the fact that it is without any question overall a pretty bad film. I could compile a long list of absurdies connected with it. For instance, while I know that part of the point of the movie is to promulgate the legend of Lara Croft, sex goddess, is there really any excuse for her wearing a thin duster that she never closes over a very tight-fitting shirt while sled dogging in Siberia? The overall list of silly moments in this film could be expanded far beyond the amount of space that isalloted any reviewer.  Most of the sexual tittilation seems more appropriately targeted at adolescents than grown ups, but, then, that is true of the Tomb Raider games as well.<p>So after these negative comments, why do I still find things to enjoy? Well, for one thing, some of the fight scenes are, if not believable, at least quite inventive and fun in their over-the-top silliness. For another, Angela Jolie is never short of absolutely marvelous to behold. Had the movie merely consisted of her strolling down a sidewalk, with those beautiful lips and other unquestionably enhanced features, the movie would have been salvaged from complete disaster. If the movie fails, it isn't her fault. Although the idea of bringing any character as supranaturally athletic as Lara Croft to screen is daunting, Angelina performs far better than could possible have been anticipated. If she struts and poses a bit more than one might like, she still managed to carry off the role with some aplomb. <p>In closing, I would like to ask, when will we see an end to movies based on computer games? So far, we have had to witness a long list of terrible movies based on otherwise decent computer games. I played Tomb Raider when it first came out, and a couple of its sequels, and I have to admit they were pretty good games. But with absolutely terrible movies based on Super Mario Brothers, Wing Commander, Mortal Kombat, and others, you have to wish for filmmakers to decide not to make any further cinematic adaptations. Actually, TOMB RAIDER is actually one of the better film versions of a game, and that ought in itself to stand as a warning to Hollywood.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="So very, very, very close"></head><body><p>Prequels to extremely popular films rarely turn out well.  By and large, they're not great, and only occasionally good.  Even rarer is a prequel that is just as good as the originals...but "Prometheus" is not one of them.  It gets so tantalizingly close to reaching that coveted rank, but just misses it.<br /><br />In the near future, a group of scientists travel to a distant planet for the scientific expedition of a lifetime: the chance to learn exactly where humans came from, and the chance to meet with our creators.  But upon arriving, they quickly learn that they may have discovered something that will lead to humanity's end.<br /><br />In many ways, "Prometheus" is an excellent film: its basic concept (what if humans were created by aliens and we could go and meet them?) is fantastic; the atmosphere and visuals are top notch, and when the film hits it's stride, it's an undeniable masterpiece, especially during the first half, where there's a constant sense of exploration and adventure, of finding new things and getting closer and closer to a coveted goal.  "Prometheus" functions as a prequel to 1979's, "Alien" and although events in this film do not lead into the original, there are numerous winks and nods towards what has come before, which are a delight for fans of the Xenomorph creature.  I especially loved learning more about the so called, "Space Jockey" creature that was seen in the original, and learning more about it's species, which arguably makes for the most engaging moments in the film.<br /><br />Sadly however, while "Prometheus" is more often then not, a fascinating film, it makes some huge blunders along the way.  The pacing in the second half of the second act unexpectedly ratchets up from slow paced to breakneck, with things happening so fast it's easy to loose track of what's going on, especially with regards to the characters (of which there are too many), and why they act the way they do; for a bunch of scientists, they make some really stupid decisions (look!  An alien life form!  Let's try to pick it up when it's clearly angry at us!) and do really bizarre things (one character, after going through a rather horrific act, goes back to wandering around the ship/exploring without bothering to tell anyone what happened, which bugs me to no end).  David the android, in particular, while fascinating to watch, lacks the simple, effective characterization that Ash and Bishop had; he does things seemingly out of random, and even two days after seeing the film, I'm still trying to figure out his motivations.<br /><br />The editing also adds to the frustration, as I got the sense that a lot was cut out of the finished film, as the rushed pace feels like a lot was cut out to save on the running time.  But worst of all is the feeling of not getting any closure. "Prometheus" raises questions it has no intention of answering, and with the ending hinting towards a sequel, the movie feels frustratingly incomplete, rather then a stand-alone film.<br /><br />While "Prometheus" comes so tantalizingly close to being a perfect film, it's incomplete feeling, breakneck speed, and choppy editing pull it down (though the third act does manage to recover, and ends with a rather spectacular finale).  It's a great movie, and when it worked, I was more absorbed in it then any other film in recent memory, but I was left with the maddening feeling that it could have crossed the threshold into classic territory if it had been a little more focused and tightened up.  Still, for what it is, it's a great ride for anyone who's ever wondered if we owe our existence to beings beyond the stars.</p></body></html>

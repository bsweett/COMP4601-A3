It's only for the hardcore Romero fan though, so I'd stick with the theatrical dvd that came out a few months back if you're just a casual fan.  4 discs on this baby:  The first one is the theatrical version we've all seen many times.  The second is the extended version which some of us have seen.  It's about 10+ minutes longer and includes some extra dialogue, extra gore, more biker footage and more shopping footage and newsroom footage as well.  It also has a scene that explains how the "Have you got any cigarettes?" cop appears out of nowhere.  Disc 3 is Dario Argento's European cut.  This is interesting.  It runs about ten minutes shorter than the theatrical version  yet contains snippets-usually a few seconds-of footage not seen in either the theatrical or extended versions!  You're probably asking why bother including a third disc?  Why not take the "new" footage from Argento's version and put it in the Extended version to make one long cut of the film?  Well, in Argento's version, there are some snippets removed from the film as well.  This kinda takes from the humor and character development, but Argento's interested in pacing here.  He edits these scenes and rearranges the music on the soundtrack so the "action" music plays in totally different scenes, making the movie move at a totally different pace.  In fact, the first half hour just zooms by in this version.  They're at the mall 30 minutes into it which isn't the case with the other versions.  It slows down when necessary, but Argento keeps the movie going.  In fact, he edits it so it looks like a Dario Argento film.  Whether you love his version or hate it is up to your personal taste.  It's not better or worse, just different.  A huge hit in Europe as well.  Disc 4 is the extra goodies.  It has a retrospective 75 minute documentary that talks to all the stars in front and behind the camera.  Very cool.  It also has Roy Frumkes' Document of the Dead, a hour and a half documentary made while Romero was filming Dawn.  I saw this years ago and it's very fun to watch.  There's also a tour of the mall with Ken Foree and other cast memebers, as well as other documentary footage.  All four discs come with the trailers and still galleries as you'd expect.  The first three discs all have commentaries by different people.  Basically this set will keep you busy for awhile.  If you're a huge fan of this film, I'm sure you know this set is out now, and I can tell you that it's worth every penny, so snatch it as soon as you can.  Fantastic movie(all 3).  There's only one Dawn Of The Dead.....You hear that Zack Snyder???  Only one!!!</p></body></html>

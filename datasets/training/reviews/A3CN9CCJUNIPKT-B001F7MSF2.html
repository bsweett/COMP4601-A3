<meta name="summary" content="An entertaining horror-comedy blockbuster"></head><body><p>"Hellboy II", ably directed by Guillermo Del Toro, picks up where the last film left off -- Hellboy is still working for a super-secret government agency in charge of cleaning up (and covering up) supernatural events. And he's still a rebel, blowing things up and punching folks out as the mood strikes him.  Del Toro and his crew clearly had a lot of fun making this, with a flippant, what-the-heck attitude coming through in every scene. The film cheerfully references "Lord Of The Rings," "Indiana Jones," "The Mummy" and any number of action-y movies -- including Del Toro's own work, with some demons that look an awful lot like the creepy guys in "Pan's Labyrinth." The easygoing air of not taking things too seriously makes this enjoyable, although the Hellboy series still seems to be finding its legs in some ways, particularly with the characters finding their voices... Selma Blair's Liz character still seems a bit flat, and Ron Perlman occasionally seems to be phoning in his scenes, but Doug Jones steals the show as the aquatic C3PO-ish Abe, and a new character -- the ectoplasmic, half-robotic group leader Krauss -- is a fascinating addition to Hellboy's Scooby Gang. Another sequel is sure to follow, particularly since we've been given tantalizing glimpses of HB's hellish royal lineage. This installment was entertaining -- I'm sure HB3 will be fun as well!

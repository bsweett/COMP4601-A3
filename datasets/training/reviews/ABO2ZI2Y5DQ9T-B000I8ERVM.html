<meta name="summary" content="Scary and Boring: Two Films in One and One is Better Than the Other"></head><body><p>Emily Rose is dead, and the court of law must determine the reason. I know horror film fans would love the film, and some reviewers have found it intelligent, but here I beg to disagree. Yes, the film is not bad, but at the same time I believe somewhere deep inside `The Exorcism of Emily Rose' there is a better film that could have been.<br /><br />The spooky opening scene effectively introduces us to the world where the supposedly possessed girl was living in a secluded house. Then you are to meet Tom Wilkinson' priest Father Moore who is charged for negligence that the prosecutor (Campbell Scott) says resulted in the death of Emily Rose. Very ambitious and agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) takes up the case to defend the priest.<br /><br />From this point, `The Exorcism of Emily Rose' starts to look like two films in one, one about the courtroom and the other about the death of Emily Rose.<br /><br />[COURTROOM DRAMA] The film says it is based on the true events, which are in themselves intriguing and intelligent too - `People vs. Exorcist' -- but what you see in the film's two hours you saw somewhere else in other countless courtroom dramas. The film has strong acting from the strong cast, but the characters are terribly flat. Though the frequent flashbacks attempt to hide the fact, the courtroom drama itself is boring and fails to live up to our expectation that we have from the initial scenes. The ambitious female lawyer is working under the slimy guy in suit. New evidence appears and witness appears and disappears as in some other films. The judge is severe (but fair). Haven't we seen them somewhere else before?<br /><br />[HORROR] Horror part of the film, which is mainly shown in the flashback scenes are slightly better, greatly helped by the very committed acting from Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose. She doesn't have to be Linda Blair with her rotating head, but it is easy to imagine she had to endure a lot. The film tries to give us shocks very often always with Ms. Carpenter doing something painful, like bending her body backward, scratching the wallpaper, and eating insects. And of course she has to growl like a demon. It is a cheap trick, some might say, but at least it is not boring.<br /><br />And whatever the producers might say about the film and its `based on the truth' story, we are attracted to the scary part of the film, and `Emily Rose' is certainly scary. But intelligent debate about the religion and the law? No, even though the film obviously wants to be so.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="There Will Be...An Ending...Soon...I Hope..."></head><body><p>This movie shows the "corporate" depravity that exist in so many people.  Putting money over all other things never leads to a good end.  Overall, I admit that I liked the film.  It should have ended about 15 minutes sooner and it would have been EXCELLENT.  However, due to that final 15 minute RANT, I can only give the film 3 stars.  The ending was unneeded in an otherwise fine film.  Lewis does an extraordinary job in his performance, but we even tire of watching his lunacy by the end.  Just a RENTAL...nothing more.</p></body></html>

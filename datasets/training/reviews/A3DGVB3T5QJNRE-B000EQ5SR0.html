<meta name="summary" content="Tired Of Infantile Endings! Tired Of Ridiculously High Body Counts! Tired Of Wonder Women!"></head><body><p>Wow! What a dim-whitted movie! It's sad to see Science Fiction sink so abysmally low this year! What formula-film-trash! Why does Hollywood repeatedly gear Science Fiction films to the mentality of teenage boys? Memo to Hollywood: THERE'S A MARKET FOR GROWN-UPS, even for Sci-Fi!!! Will someone please fill this nitch! PLEASE! I'm not asking for perfection, or genius. Just an ending without any ridiculous predictability, which, in turn, is devoid of any meaning, or real satisfaction. A film where more than half the time is NOT focused on killing and body counts. No more Wonder Women, (or men) who barely get scratched in mortal combat, or don't even bother to break into a sweat! In other words, out with the old LOWEST CAMP DENOMINATOR, and in with some new GROWN-UP STORY TELLING!<br /><br />The world of Aeon Flux is where men are either fools; conservative mass murderers; or fall like cardboard, and die like butter. Women, on the other hand, are tough as steal; have muscles; sleep with men and then knock them out, (ouch!); kill with such perfection, and ease, I thought they must be cyborgs; and single-handedly change the course of history!<br /><br />Here's a future where no one bothers to take a look on the other side of a big wall in 400-years! Human cloning and the quest for immortality are the root of all evil! Where killing pregnent women is done in order to keep the status quo, that is, mostly men in charge!<br /><br />Oh, yes the special-effect-eye-candy is magnificent! Too bad the storyline is two dimentional. I'll trade a low budget, low eye-candy film with a good story over this tedious trash, any day!<br /><br />Do us all a big favor! Don't encourage Hollywood to continuely make nonsense like Aeon Flux! Instead of trudging off to your local theater, treat yourself to a great film like the Matrix, or discover an old gem, like Zardoz! Maybe then, Hollywood will start diversifying again!</p></body></html>

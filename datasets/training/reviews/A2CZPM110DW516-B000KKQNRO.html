<meta name="summary" content="The lying devil of old"></head><body><p>The wretchedly written and grammatically incorrect sentences in the excerpts I glimpsed from Dan Brown's "The DaVinci Code" were more than enough to discourage me from reading his controversial best-seller, but I was curious enough about the uproar to watch Ron Howard's film version on DVD.<br /><br />Is it really as blasphemous as critics charge?<br /><br />Oh my, is it ever.<br /><br />If fans of Brown's fiction were to bother reading the Bible, they might see how this preposterous attempt to disprove the divinity of Jesus Christ is just one more example of end-times prophecy being fulfilled. The mockers and blasphemers are coming forward in great numbers, just as Jesus said they would, determined to recast the Son of God in deceptive New Age terms or to dismiss Him all-together. In doing so, they are paving the way for the Antichrist who will deceive the whole world into accepting him as the Messiah.<br /><br />The big bad beast does not make an appearance in Howard's film, but his coming is alluded to in the climax. The figure whom, it is suggested, is the only one worthy to possess the Holy Grail could be no one else. It certainly isn't the real Christ because the pursuit of some so-called Holy Grail is pure idolatry as warned against by God. Placing mystical value on any object, be it the chalice that Jesus sipped from during the Last Supper, or the spear that pierced His side during the crucifixion, or the Shroud of Turin, is Satanic in origin, emphasizing that which has been created rather than the Creator himself.<br /><br />As for DaVinci, it is well-known that he was a member of several secret societies, the likes of which still flourish today, to carry out the devil's plan to blind our eyes to the truth. Any "codes" in his work are in service to that lying devil of old and reveal nothing but his own corruption.<br /><br />On a purely cinematic level, "The DaVinci Code" is still a bust. This is third-rate Indiana Jones stuff, poorly made and indifferently acted. With the kinks in his hair ironed out, Tom Hanks looks like...well, I'll leave it to you to choose the private anatomical part he most resembles. The two-time Oscar winner's seemingly invulnerable career hit a bump in the road around the time of "The Terminal." His presence in a film based on a cheap pop culture phenomenon may have temporarily stalled his decline, but in the long run it may only accelerate it. Ian McKellon is so obnoxious here that I wanted to slap him.<br /><br />As for Ron Howard, he probably should have stayed in Mayberry. He wouldn't have gone on to a directing career or an Oscar, but as the Bible asks, "What doth it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul?"<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks</p></body></html>

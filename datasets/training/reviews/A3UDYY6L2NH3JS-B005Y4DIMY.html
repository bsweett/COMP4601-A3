<meta name="summary" content="Pleasure is square triangular suffering!"></head><body><p>Clive Barker is unique in the field of horror and fantastique. All is based on the square and cubic figures. The magic box is cubic and its opening opens doors to hell. The basic human situation is also square. The father, his second wife, his brother and his daughter. We can see at once that this square figure is not that square. It is centered on the father and hence we have a trihedral figure, the father at the top and the three others building the triangular base. This geometry is reflected in the three cenobites, plus a fourth one that appears afterwards, in Pinhead whose pins are planted on a square pattern, in the house that has three floors, Franck ? living ? on the third one, hence in an inverted order. It is the absolute hatred and rivalry between the two brothers that determines the whole story. One is a social success. The other one is a marginal reject and he wants to take his revenge. So from the third floor, from the top of the house, he will come down and steal his brother&#8217;s wife and skin and try to steal his daughter. Hence there is a strong trinity in this vision, but a trinity that is perverted from the outside. The cube itself decomposes in a whole and complex set of triangular or semi-triangular forms, and it is this decomposition that leads to the opening of the doors of hell. When these triangular shapes are brought back into the cubic form things go back to normal. <p>The film is based on a simple idea : pleasure is going beyond the limits of normalcy. Hence pleasure goes beyond pleasure itself, as it is understood by ordinary people, and thus the acme of pleasure is suffering. The cenobites themselves are humans who have inflicted suffering on other fellow humans and have thus deserved being promoted into angelic devils, monsters who bring pleasure through suffering. The best part of this film is that there is an escape, but it is so narrow, so fragile, that it practically does not exist. It is pure luck, chance, randomness. There appears no plan, no order, no logic in this escape. Any deal is crooked and one has to keep his fingers crossed and nothing else. Fate is fatal and lethal, fetal and regressive....</p></body></html>

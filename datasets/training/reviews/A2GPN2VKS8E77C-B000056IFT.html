I didn't understand the story from the beginning, though I saw this pile of junk from start to finish. With an excellent cast and the director of "Robocop" behind the camera, I thought this movie would be so much better than it really was. It was such a piece of crap. Mind-boggling story. Total b.s. of a movie. not worth all the f---ing hype. "Terminator 2: Judgement Day" is a helluva better action/sci-fi movie than this turgid waste of an excuse for gratuitous violence and nudity. Rated Crappholy.</p></body></html>

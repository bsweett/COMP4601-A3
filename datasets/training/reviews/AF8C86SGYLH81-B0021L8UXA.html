This highly entertaining remake of George Romero's classic is best suited for today's horror/sci-fi fans.  I gave it 4 stars because it hits on all but one cylinder...Romero's unique style that really doesn't need the Hollywood touch.  The acting was okay.  Timothy Olyphant as the sheriff and Radha Mitchell as his wife were credible, but the true acting performance was turned in by Joe Anderson as the deputy...very convincing.  There are creepy moments, lots of chills and tamed down gore.  The "crazies" are made even more scary via excellent makeup and effects.  Kudos there.  The story tries to branch off where no film has ever gone, but how many flicks are out there about the government covering up a catastrophic mistake they made?  Worth a watch...but not a second time.  The extras are great, especially two episodes of The Crazies motion comics.</p></body></html>

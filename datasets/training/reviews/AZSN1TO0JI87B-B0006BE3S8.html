That's about what "Alien Vs. Predator" adds up to. With the intense action of the average "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" episode and the genius story-writing, matched only by "xXx," "Alien Vs. Predator" is every bit as tame, lame, vapid and pointless as every bad review you've read. In all honesty, I don't know what I'm doing here, writing a review. It's all been said before. You should know better by now. And if you made the same mistake I made recently by giving it a fair chance, you will only be left feeling stupid. Paul W.S. Anderson, who directed the "Mortal Kombat" flick that, even at the age of 11, was too dumb for me, botches the material in every way possible. The Predator(s) come across as teddy bears, the Alien is just a crummy plot-device, and the characters have no soul whatsoever. Add that to the fact that action is without intensity and the horror is non-existent, compounded by the shoddy special effects, and you have possibly the worst movie made since the turn of the century. The fact that this is rated PG-13 alone tells you enough. Suffice it to say, if you watch this and expect to get anything out if it, the joke's on you.</p></body></html>

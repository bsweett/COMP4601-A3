It comes on two discs, has gorgeous packaging, and, apparently: &quot;The first disc has the movie plus a DVD-ROM feature containing three different versions of the screenplay, which can be read scene-by-scene along with the film. On the second disc there are seven deleted scenes, including a fascinating foreshadowing of Sarah Connor's mission in T2, as well as trailers and TV spots. There are also two &quot;making of&quot; featurettes, one being an 18-minute piece from1992 based around a friendly at-home chat with Cameron and Schwarzenegger (&quot;We did the first Terminator for the cost of your motor-home on the second film&quot;, jokes the director to the actor). The hour-long &quot;Other Voices&quot; featurette is an in-depth montage of cast and crew reminiscences covering all aspects of the production from its initial genesis as a fevered nightmare to the &quot;guerrilla&quot; filmmaking of getting the final shots. Script collaborator Bill Wisher neatly sums up the movie as &quot;It's a Wonderful Life, with guns&quot;. The second disc also contains a stills archive of production photographs, James Cameron's amazing original conceptual artwork, plus his first story treatment.&quot; I own a copy and I don't even had a DVD player yet, which shows you how good it is.</p></body></html>

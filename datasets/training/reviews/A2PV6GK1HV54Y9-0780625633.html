<meta name="summary" content="Where is Edward Norton's Oscar for this incredible film?"></head><body><p>American History X is deeply moving, dripping with importance, and incredibly daring to say the least. What a movie this is, Norton plays a former Neo-Nazi who has just been released from prison. His younger brother played by Edward Furlong has now followed in his former footsteps, as Derrick (Norton) tries to reform his baby brother not to hate, he recalls the last several years in prison, how he was brutally raped and struck an unlikely friendship with a black inmate. The film travels between color and black and white images. The ending still gets me to this day, a movie you have to see. I highly recommend this realistic portrait of one man's determination to make right with an uncertain future and his embarrassing past.</p></body></html>

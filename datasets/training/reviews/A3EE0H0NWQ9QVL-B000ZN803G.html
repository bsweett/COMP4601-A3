His vision of Chris McCandless's life (via Jon Krakauer's book `Into the Wild') is simply stunning. While most pictures that go outdoors give you some breathtaking scenes, this film makes the close shots of formidable and forbidding nature a staple element throughout the movie. Having just watched the movie at a local cinema with a smaller screen, I was content, not needing a big screen TV or a visit to the I-Max. To sustain a story and an outdoor adventure for nearly two and a half hours is a feat unto itself, but the characters and reflections are satisfying enough to take the audience to its destination.<br /><br />Besides Penn's perfectionism, we have a fine story told well. Starting with Chris's real life journal, we go back and forth from his well-to-do family back to his destination on the outskirts of Fairbanks, and then trace back his journey along the way until he reached his destination. Chris had all the trappings of success. An "A" student with a wealthy family to help him along the way, something was, nevertheless, missing. To fill in the gaps, his sister (Jena Malone) narrates part of the story, telling us about the family he left behind. Then, he encounters all kinds of people from the working class farmers of South Dakota, to a latent hippie couple in Arizona, to a retired military man in California. Like road stories from films like `Easy Rider' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000022TSY">Easy Rider</a> to books like Kerouac's `On the Road,' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140283293">On the Road (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)</a>this is a high caliber road movie, even if the destination is off the beaten path. With all its grandeur and absorbing development, this movie reminded me of the truly excellent 'Never Cry Wolf,' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000069HYH">Never Cry Wolf (Full Screen Edition)</a>which this film has easily trumped.<br /><br />Trouble is Chris's problems don't resolve themselves with nature. In his journal, he expresses his thoughts well and quotes the works of Thoreau, Tolstoy, and Pasternak who help him share his vision of happiness that can't be bought. Nature can be quite unforgiving, but the wisdom Chris picks up along the way make his uncompromising attempt to live life on his own terms both laudably courageous and a cautionary tale told to the rest of us.<br /><br />All of the performances are as true to life as the footage. Including William Hurt who gives us another laudable performance as Chris's driven father, Walt, a successful space engineer. Emile Hirsch captures all the spirit and naivete' of Chris, and Marcia Gay Harden is perfect as the worried, doting mom. But the real master is Penn who is able to share Chris's vision. Meaningful, poetic, colorful, eventful, and magnificent in grandeur, `Into the Wild' is simply a cinematic Odyssey taken by a careful hand who wanted to make both the man and his journey unforgettable.</p></body></html>

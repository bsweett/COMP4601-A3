<meta name="summary" content="Mamet Writes and Directs and Val Kilmer Gives a Great Performance"></head><body><p>The one thing you must understand is David Mamet is a master wordsmith.  His plays and films are about the words said.  The difficult thing is he also likes to repeat key phrases and overlay conversations - that is have two precisely timed conversations going on at the same time.  Therefore, pay close attention to what is being said.<br /><br />The president's daughter has been abducted and special ops agent Scott has been assigned to find her before anyone finds out.  He first finds her boyfriend.  The boyfriend tells him that they broke up and she is seeing a professor.  Additionally he finds out that she went to a club where college girls can make a few bucks entertaining businessmen.  This leads to a brothel and a madam who leads them to a white slavery ring.  They discover that the ring is run by an imprisoned Lebanese man.  They run an elaborate sting to find where she is being shipped from.  This runs afoul and they are going to rescue her from slavers camp.  But they receive news that her body was found drowned off the coast with the professor.<br /><br />Curtis, Scott's second, tells him that he does not believe she drowned.  The beach house where she was kept had her short sign,%-), in the window and that when he was cleaning his car he found a fragment of an earring.  She was wearing that earring in a recent photo.  They go back to the beach house and a sniper awaits them.  This means something is very a miss.  Scott finally figures out that if the truth came out, that it could cause the president great embarrassment and so the president decided to cut his losses.  Scott will not let his assignment fail and devises a rescue.<br /><br />Val Kilmer's career has been up and down mostly due to bizarre choices of roles.  This is one of his finest roles.  He is not a Mamet actor but definitely handles Mamet's tricky dialogue with great ease.  Look out for Veronica Mars star Kristen Bell as the president's daughter.<br /><br />As stated above, Mamet is very word oriented.  Sometimes his films get to be very talky and you can easily get lost. Plus this is an action film; words and action don't generally work together.  But this is not the case.  He also directed the film, so I think that he had control of all aspects and when the scenes that involve Mamet talk are on, they are scintillating.  And action sequences are tense.  This is a well made film.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS: None</p></body></html>

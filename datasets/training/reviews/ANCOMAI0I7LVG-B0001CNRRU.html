Sure, he dwells within the realms of his `one-trick' and some define him as gimmicky (interwoven character arcs thriving within a convoluted structure) but he knows how to make that `gimmick' sing for all it's worth.  He did it with `Amores Perros' and he does it here too.  He also did it with `Babel', but to a less than magnificent result.<br /><br />`21 Grams' may be his best film to date.<br /><br />The film tells the complicated and heartrending story of a young woman named Christina who is drawn into the lives of two men after a tragic accident leaves her widowed.  One of those men is Paul, a professor in dire need of a heart transplant.  The other man is Jack, an ex-convict who has turned his life over to god in order to atone for his sins, one of which being the cause of Christina's predicament.<br /><br />Yes, Jack killed her husband.<br /><br />Shifting back and forth within time, `21 Grams' weaves a delicate web of harsh realities that brings the audience to a dark place thriving with life.  The complexities are all held tightly within these three amazingly real characters, all of which come to life in vivid and mesmerizing ways.  My first viewing of this film left me rather spellbound.  I knew it wasn't perfect (not many films are), but it also had such a strong hold on my emotions that I was compelled to watch it again and again and again.  Every time I see this film I am rushed with more emotions, for it remains real and compelling every time.  The reality that life is fragile and that life is every changing seeps through every pore of this film.  You can't help but watch these shattered souls and wonder how they make it through.  Their struggles are so deeply felt, so richly realized.  Some have balked at the films unending sense of torment, but for me it never really becomes something unbelievably harsh.  `21 Grams' uses the darker realities of life as a stepping stone to establish human tendencies and the need within us all to survive.  It also shows the will we have to right the wrongs and redeem ourselves through the survival of others.<br /><br />As depressing as this film is, it is strangely uplifting upon reflection.<br /><br />The performances here are all stellar, especially from Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts.  Watts, one of the greatest actresses of her generation (a few pegs shy of Kate Winslet), delivers a gut punch performance here.  Some call this performance too dramatic, but I think that that particular perception may be poisoned by the films narrative flow.  It only seems dramatic because the pieces are not in order.  When you consider how she builds her character and look at it from that view then you see a completely realized character.  She understands how to live within the character.  You can see her taking in every moment, and it helps create someone truly unforgettable.  Del Toro is one of the better actors working today.  This performance is most certainly his finest to date.  The way he drenches himself in his character determination, allowing his every fault to become his driving force; it's unmistakably solid.  Instead of falling into the clich&eacute; of playing a `Jesus Freak' with obviousness, he underscores a generic character with flourishes of purpose and understanding.  Sean Penn, an actor I find highly overrated, is very good here.  This performance is FAR better than his hammy Oscar winning one from the same year (how he one of `Mystic River' is beyond me).  He understands the subtlety that is needed to highlight to unnerving reality befalling this man.  You can see him slowly withering away within his own solitude.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also magnificent here, especially the significant others played by Danny Huston, Melissa Leo and Charlotte Gainsbourg.<br /><br />In the end I highly recommend this film.  It is an eternal downer at first glance, so be prepared to take your mood down a few notches, but the rich script allows for the emotions to display themselves in interesting and provoking ways, and this is definitely a film that will continue to provoke you to think, and glean.</p></body></html>

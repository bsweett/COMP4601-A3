<meta name="summary" content="BRING ON THE SEQUEL!"></head><body><p>Planet of the Apes brings to the screen another remake (and a surprisingly good one at that) of the classic science fiction movie that we all know so well by now.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg, Elena Bonham Carter, Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows allowing for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again.<br /><br />The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, the costumes, and the music are all EXCELLENT.<br /><br />The only major setback is in relation to the human slaves who do not have a "slave" mentality characterized by fear and humility; instead, they behave like... Americans.<br /><br />Overall, Planet of the Apes is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!<br /><br />In conclusion, the film establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a sequel, which I would definitely line up to watch! 4? Stars</p></body></html>

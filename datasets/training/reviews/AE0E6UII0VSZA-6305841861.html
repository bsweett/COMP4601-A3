If the Three Stooges decided to put on hockey masks and make a horror film, this would've been the movie they made. Sam Raimi's spectacular sequel to the infinitely popular cult series that was spawned by his visionary &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; (originally titled &quot;Book of the Dead,&quot; but the producers thought that a literary reference in the title would send prospective viewers astray) is so endlessly funny, violent and action-packed with uncanny sound effects and manic cinematography from Peter Deming (who worked with Wes Craven on &quot;Screams 2 and 3&quot;). It's a never-ending exercise in dark humor and all-out original thinking, and right at its center, a marvelously ordinary hero, Ashley J. Williams, played with amazing physical comic talent by Bruce Campbell, who is apparently the master of flipping himself over.<p>The film starts off as a sort of recap of the events that left Ash alone in the woods during the first &quot;Evil Dead,&quot; with some different adaptations (his other friends in the original were never there, only his girlfriend Linda). Then we're launched headfirst into this hair-raising carnival ride that takes plunges into all-out comedy and then rockets us back up into loops of hellacious scares. The very first brand new scene of the movie is something of a masterpiece as the Evil being in the woods sweeps Ash off his feet and carries him through the treetops. I didn't know whether to think &quot;cool&quot; or start laughing so hard I'd puke, so I did both (didn't puke, though). The new characters are introduced, some are turned into demons, some aren't. All of them reach a grisly demise either at the hands of the demonic forces of the woods, or by the ax of Ash himself, who is always in imminent danger of converting into a member of the Evil Dead fan club himself. As is the usual of films of the horror genre back in the eighties, the acting can be laughably bad at times. Bruce isn't exactly impressive, but he has his moments of believability, and he wears them proudly. But bad acting or not, &quot;Evil Dead 2&quot; is one of the best times a horror film has ever given me. I attribute this to a terrific comic performance from Campbell, the experimental camerawork from Peter Deming, and the kinetic direction from Sam Raimi. This is a movie that will be offering a good time to generations of dedicated film buffs in the years to come.</p></body></html>

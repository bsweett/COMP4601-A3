What I found in that movie's place was another movie, a more interesting one with an interesting cruel side, and that was really worth a watch. We start with a man hat claims he can identify any smell in the world and that he wants to own them all. To do this he has plans; some of his plans seem not-so-bad at first but then they take on a darker shade. And that's where the fun begins and an interesting story starts playing out.<br /><br />One of the main reasons this movie was so successful was the ability of our lead character to seem so many things at once. Sometimes you cold taste the menace that swirled around and sometimes you could see other pieces of persona swimming around in his tangled expressions. The life he gave tot the role was amazing because of this - I expected few things going in to the movie but I really didn't expect someone to so brazenly steal the spotlight.<br />He was perfect.<br />The support cast was really god as well, and all these efforts combined helped build a rather interesting storyline that I would have missed if it had not been for a suggestion on rentals.<br /><br />If you want a diversion that is out-of-the-ordinary and like the way the plot to the movie goes, then this might be a pick for you. I enjoyed it but, at the same time, I was looking for a B-movie to fill in my watching void and was happy that it was superbly better than "B." Still, it comes with a "worth watching" if you like your story with a little darkside attached to it underpinning.</p></body></html>

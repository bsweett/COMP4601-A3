<meta name="summary" content="Good movie killed by lousy ending"></head><body><p>Sometimes you are watching a movie and enjoying yourself and then, in one moment, something so ludicrous happens on screen that the entire movie is ruined.  That is High Tension in a nutshell, a film that goes from four star quality to two stars in a matter of seconds.  Only the thrills of the first part of the movie keep it from a one-star review.<br /><br />The story follows a pair of college age girls, Marie and Alex who go to visit Alex's family at an isolated farm.  In the middle of the night, a twisted killer arrives and starts killing the family one-by-one, until only the two girls are left:  Alex, because the killer intends to take her prisoner and subject her to various acts of sadism; Marie because the killer is unaware of her presence.<br /><br />What follows is a suspenseful game of cat and mouse, with Marie intent on rescuing her friend while avoiding notice.  And it works well, until around fifteen minutes from the end, when a plot twist is thrown in that utterly ruins the movie.  I won't spoil things, but suffice it to say it uses one of the most tired cliches in the suspense genre.  In addition, the twist requires actively lying to the viewer and makes no sense in terms of what happened before.<br /><br />Although I didn't see his name credited anywhere, the story (up to the twist) is clearly based on Dean Koontz's novel Intensity.  If he didn't get paid, there are enough similarities for a successful plagiarism suit.  For viewing purposes, this may not be important, but Koontz fans will catch on quickly.<br /><br />The best I can recommend for the this movie is to turn off the movie right after Marie's inevitable confrontation with the killer.  To that point, it is a good movie, if you a fan of slasher flicks.  Shortly afterwards, however, things go bad very quickly.  However, since most like to stick around to the closing credits, I recommend that this one be skipped altogether.</p></body></html>

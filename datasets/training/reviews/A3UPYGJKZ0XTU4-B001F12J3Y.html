<meta name="summary" content="Real Performances Amid Stunning Animation."></head><body><p>"The Polar Express" is an animated film based on Chris Van Allsburg's children's Christmas book. The book is only 29 pages long, and this movie is an hour and 40 minutes, so additional material has been extrapolated from Van Allsburg's story. It tells the tale of a young boy who is beginning to doubt the existence of Santa Claus, flying reindeers, and Christmas magic. He awakes in the middle of the night before Christmas to find that a train, the Polar Express bound for the North Pole, has stopped in front of his house. The conductor persuades the boy to climb aboard, and it's off to the North Pole to see Santa Claus give out the First Gift of Christmas and begin his whirlwind journey to deliver gifts to all the world's children. But not before the boy has some adventures on board the train with the other children passengers.<br /><br />In making "The Polar Express", director Robert Zemeckis wanted to recreate the style of Chris Van Allburg's oil painting that illustrate the book. He needed a method of animating the film that could do that, yet convey subtlety and realism in performances from the actors. Zemeckis used a motion capture system designed by Ken Ralston at Sony Pictures Imageworks, which they called "Performance Capture". The actors are filmed wearing form-fitting "mo-cap" suits studded with reflective markers, which are also applied to their faces, so their body language and expressions can be used as a blueprint for the animation. The amazing thing about this is that the actors' performances are preserved even when their appearance is altered dramatically by the animators. Tom Hanks plays 5 roles in the film, including the little boy protagonist! The little boy looks nothing like Hanks, and yet Hanks was able to physically act the role. Adult actors Nona Gaye, Peter Scolari, and Eddie Deezen also play children. They were filmed against sets 160% normal size to get the scale right for their young characters. Michael Jeter plays both the train engineer and its fireman, one of whom is fat and one skinny.<br /><br />The results of the animation are truly impressive. "The Polar Express" looks like an oil painting come to life. There are some really beautiful scenes. And the characters seem so much like live action characters that I was a little perplexed while I watched it. I thought this must be a live action film shot against a green screen and digitally animated, but I wondered how that was possible with a cast of child actors. Reading about the film afterwards solved the mystery. That must have been some shoot with everyone wearing leotards and Tom Hanks often playing 2 characters in the same scene! In any case, "The Polar Express" is one of the better Christmas movies I've seen, digital effects aside. Adults will enjoy some laugh-out-loud moments and entrancing scenery as well as children. It's bound to become a Christmas classic.</p></body></html>

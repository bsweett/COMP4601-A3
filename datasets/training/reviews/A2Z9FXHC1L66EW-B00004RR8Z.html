<meta name="summary" content="Great Alien Boxset! But Don't Get Rid Of Your First Edition!"></head><body><p>The Alien series is without a doubt one of the best ever pieces of filmmaking created on film.  Not only does it have an amazing storyline, a strong female lead, some of the scariest creatures ever created, as well as some great action sequences and chills to boot, but it also has real depth and a strong sense of perseverance.  The first two films are still the true gems, with both Ridley Scott &amp; James Cameron at the top of their game.  And the Extended and/or Director's Cut versions only make the films even better.  But Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection are still very good installments.  Although most of us are still angry with the direction that Alien 3 took, more and more are admitting how strong a film it actually is today.  And with the resurrection of Ripley in the fourth movie, who knows where the series will take us?  Earth?  The original home of the Aliens?  Only time will tell.<p>I just finished looking at everything on the Alien Quadrilogy.  Took a long time too.  Lots of archival reading to get through.  Very thorough.  Enjoyed the special editions to Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection a lot, though I preferred the original opening to Alien Resurrection and the original ending to Alien 3 from the theatrical versions.  The commentaries were pretty good.  Too bad Sigourney Weaver only participates in the original Alien and none of the other films (and even then, she doesn't say all that much) She does discuss ideas for Alien 5 with Ridley Scott towards the end (maybe she wants him to direct part 5?????).  My favorite had to be the &quot;Aliens&quot; commentary parts with Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henrickson, and Jenette Goldstein (Vasquez).  Bill saying that he's not getting paid to record this commentary but is at least getting free beer and reuniting with his Alien costars, was a highlight.  The commentaries for the theatrical versions are the same as the ones for the director's cut/special expanded editions, only some comments are omitted here and there, except in Alien 3 &amp; Alien Resurrection.  Some additional comments are made at the end of the theatrical cuts of Alien 3 and the opening of Alien Resurrection, since significant changes were made to the films.  The segmented documentaries are also very detailed from the first film to the fourth.  Lots of great information!  The real empty feeling is the absence of David Fincher during the Alien 3 &quot;making of&quot; (except when you see him during the actual filming days) as well as from the commentary, since the director's from all the other installments participated.  Some disappointments were that not all the extras from the original Alien DVD Boxset were included in this new one, such as Ridley Scott's own personal audio commentary by himself along with another separate additional bonus audio track of different music cues by Jerry Goldsmith and some other cool things to listen to while watching the film (like the original audio track during filming where you can actually hear Ridley giving Sigourney direction as she moves about the ship towards the end.  The original featurettes from the first boxset are all missing too.  Plus the bonus 5th DVD from the original boxset that you had to mail away for to get in the states isn't featured here either, which is a bit surprising.  And for me, I was just surprised that the Aliens theatrical trailer was shown Pan &amp; Scan, when a letterboxed version does exist (I have it on my Big Trouble In Little China 2 DVD Special Edition).  I'm just glad I didn't sell the original boxset as I originaly intended.  I like retaining all the extra material made available.  Still a great 25th Anniversary Boxset Collection...</p></body></html>

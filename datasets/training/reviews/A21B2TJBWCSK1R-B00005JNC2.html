Made for a paltry (by Hollywood standards) $2.5 million, it has gone on to gross over ten times its budget and, more importantly, become the defining film for a generation of young, disaffected people who clearly identify with this personal movie and its fascinating characters.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Braff and Portman that is quite engaging and personable. Not surprisingly, Braff dominates while Portman gamely asks him many questions to keep things going.<br /><br />There is a second audio commentary featuring Braff, director of photography Lawrence Sher, editor Myron Kerstein and production designer Judy Becker. With his dry wit, Braff MCs this track as the participants talk about the more technical aspects of the movie.<br /><br />Also included are 16 deleted scenes with optional commentary by all the participants from the second commentary. Braff puts the footage in its context and talks about why they were cut (for time).<br /><br />"The Making of Garden State" examines how Braff put his movie together. There is quite a bit of decent behind-the-scenes footage and plenty of interview soundbites from the cast and crew. For a Making Of featurette it is refreshingly free of an excess of clips from the movie that always pad out the running time of these things.<br /><br />There is also a fairly amusing collection of blown lines and bloopers.<br /><br />Finally, there is a promo for the film's soundtrack.<br /><br />Garden State is a film bursting with ideas, keen observations on life and memorable images that make most other films look inert by comparison. There is a tendency for first-time filmmakers to throw everything into the mix on their debut because they aren't sure if the film will succeed and they'll get a second chance. Based on the strong critical and commercial success of Garden State, I don't think Zach Braff will have this problem.</p></body></html>

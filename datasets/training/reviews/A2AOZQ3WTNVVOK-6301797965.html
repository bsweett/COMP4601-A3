<meta name="summary" content="Gene Wilder as the Funniest Dr. Frankenstein"></head><body><p>After having seen "Blazing Saddles" in the theater, I was quite anxious to see "Young Frankenstein."  I thought "Blazing Saddles" was funny, but "Young Frankenstein" was even funnier.<br /><br />Frederick (or possibly FRO-de-rick, as suggested by Igor, played by Marty Feldman) Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) has inherited his father's estate.  His father's estate is a gothic castle in Transylvania with secret passages and a basement full of the original "Frankenstein" equipment; just the sort of recreation room that any mad scientist would love.  However, Frederick is somewhat straight laced; a doctor set on trying to divorce himself from the Frankenstein name.  However, once he arrives at the castle he seems to become intrigued by being a Frankenstein, and after discovering a book, "How I Did It," he decides it is time to make his own creature.<br /><br />Inga (nicely played by the beautiful Teri Garr) is Frederick's ditzy blonde laboratory assistant.  Frederick is encouraged by the creepy Frau Bl&uuml;cher (Chloris Leachman).  Frederick is often just as discouraged by the bumbling of slightly dimwitted but witty assistant Igor and by the innocent monster, convincingly played by Peter Boyle.  Filling out the background is Madeline Kahn as Frederick's fianc&eacute;e Elizabeth and Kenneth Mars as Police Inspector Kemp.  Buried deep in the credits is Gene Hackman as the blind man.  Even knowing who was playing the blind man I still had a hard time recognizing Gene Hackman.<br /><br />The humor in this movie is multi-faceted.  Sometimes the laughs are cheap, other times they are more sophisticated.  Mel Brooks originally cut the scene where Igor says "...walk this way..." and Gene Wilder starts to hobble down the stairs on Igor's cane.  However, the scene is one of the best, and most frequently recalled, scenes in the movie.  The scene with the revolving bookcase remains one of my favorite scenes.<br /><br />There are plenty of one-liners to keep the pace moving.  Werewolf?  There wolf.  You take the blonde and I'll take the one in the turban.  The list of short jokes is lengthy, and nearly all the jokes work.<br /><br />This movie pays homage to "Frankenstein" and "The Bride of Frankenstein."  I also read that this movie was a tribute to "Son of Frankenstein," but in the making of on the DVD the first two movies were mentioned and I do not recall the last movie being named.<br /><br />The special edition DVD contains a wealth of material.  My favorite material was the making-of feature, the out-takes and the bloopers.  The deleted scenes varied from interesting to dull, and in general I found it easy to understand why the scenes were deleted.  The production stills had some interesting prints, but there were also stills that were repetitive and boring.  The variety of trailers included gave potential viewers a good preview of the movie.  There was even a trailer for a re-release, which I did not remember.  There are also some interviews conducted in Mexico that contained some interesting material, and were thankfully short.<br /><br />"Young Frankenstein" is a movie that has managed to retain its humor for decades.  The jokes are generally timeless, and most of them are set up well enough to be funny.  There are jokes that fall a little flat, but fortunately these are few.  I attribute much of the quality of this movie to the script that began with Gene Wilder and was modified by Mel Brooks.  The result is one of the best movies that Mel Brooks ever directed, and one of the best movies in which these actors appeared.  This movie is a must-have for fans of comedy and for fans of classic horror films.</p></body></html>

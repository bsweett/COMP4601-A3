For William Friedkin's `Bug,' we enter mostly for fascination or shock value.  The film is unforgettable.  Mostly the characters, the actions, and atmosphere leave the audience with indelible impressions long after the movie's credits roll.<br /><br />Not a pleasant affair, the movie opens up with a helicopter zeroing in on a town in Oklahoma.  At a hotel room, a cocktail waitress, Agnes (Ashley Judd) , is drinking heavily alone while she receives incessant, unwanted phone calls from someone who won't answer.  She addresses the call to Jerry, her estranged husband who has been let out of prison after a two year sentence.  Her existence seems tight and oppressive, and the camera keeps going to the central air that kicks in periodically and a ceiling fan seen from a close, dizzying angle.  We are constantly reminded of the oppressive heat.  Shortly, we hook up at the honky tonk bar where she works with fellow waitress, R.C., whom we discover is her lover as well.  R.C. makes two company at the apartment, but she brings a guest from the panhandle of Oklahoma.  Nervous, yet friendly, Peter Evans (Michael Shannon) seems so shy and apologetic, he couldn't hurt a fly.  Somehow he has left an army hospital, but has no where to stay.  In the meantime, Jerry (Harry Connick, Jr.),  her -ex, returns to her for an unbearable homecoming and reciprocates her cold reception with hot menace.  Yet, for Jerry, Peter is the unwelcome find.  Peter, nevertheless, provides Jerry with the perfect, cowering victim.  From here Agnes finds her new guest a respite from all her indignities.  His gentleness is a counterpart for male abuse.<br /><br />Peter, on the other hand, has problems of his own.  During one bedroom scene, the lights come on, and he is fixated on a bug.  What starts as a small "aphid" becomes an obsession.  The camera zeroes in on the lighted sheets for a small bug Agnes at first can't see.  From a bed search comes a whole investigation, complete with his own blood samples examined under a microscope.  As scenes unfold we see the vulnerability of Agnes as she falls into the vortex of all the madness:  her domineering -ex and the unhinging paranoia of her new lover.<br /><br />`Bug' is unforgettable.  With excellent, intense acting we get a cross-section of madness with clinical precision.  William Friedkin (of `The Exorcist' and `The French Connection' fame) gets it right with all the disturbing details.  Working from a powerful play by Tracy Letts, we get a remarkably different cinematic offering with a resolution few will ever forget.</p></body></html>

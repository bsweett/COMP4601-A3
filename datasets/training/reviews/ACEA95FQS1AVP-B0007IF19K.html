<meta name="summary" content="Jamie Foxx IS Ray Charles..."></head><body><p>I saw the Aviator and loved it because I didn't really know those people.  My Mom refused to watch it.  She grew up with the real people depicted and was bothered by seeing others "pretending" to be them.  However, she watched this movie and all she could say afterwards was "Creepy.  It's creepy how he got into Ray Charles' skin like that!" I couldn't say it better myself.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx deserved the best actor Oscar more than any other winner--because it is harder to make audiences suspend their disbelief when playing a real peron, and an icon to boot.</p></body></html>

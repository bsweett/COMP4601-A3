<meta name="summary" content="Vastly overrated and disappointing (possible spoliers)"></head><body><p>I love Danny Boyle and I appreciate him as director and it's great he has got all the acclaim he deserves, but I'm going to go ahead and respectfully say that I didn't see what the big deal was with his latest, Slumdog Millionaire. Sure, it was a great effort; the photography was great, the music was also great, and the acting for the most part was good, but there were a few things that really turned me off when it came to Slumdog Millionaire. One of them being how the film presented itself in the form of a Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? question and ended with the painfully predictable answer. This was just a way too pretentious and just flat out silly way to start a movie.  I also felt the hackneyed back-and-forth storytelling between Jamal being accused of cheating and the story of his life and how he came to know the answers was trite and very formulaic, especially for a Danny Boyle movie. Also, even though I did like the ending to the movie, it was the exact ending I saw coming within the first 10 minutes of the movie. There were literally no surprises in Slumdog. Just a rather stale connect-the-dots movie. I also felt the dance number at the end credits was horribly out of place and I had to remind myself that I didn't just watch a Step Up sequel, but a Danny Boyle film. Other than that, I would just like to say I really didn't hate the movie, as I gave it 3 stars, I was just hoping for a definite 5 out 5, and in that, I was extremely disappointed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a weak ending to a great franchise"></head><body><p>I've heard it said that Nemesis was the last of the Next Generation movies (but how many last star trek movies had shatner..). It's a weak ending. The problem is a writer who hasn't written much and a director who is unfamiliar with the franchise and has little experience directing (though a lot of good editing jobs). It's an interesting story that centers around Picard and Data. Riker gets a good action sequence. Troi has a decent role. As does Jordi. But Worf was just overlooked in this film. They touched on all the different series in one way or another. I know that the Star Trek franchise won't end, even if it isn't the Next Generation cast anymore. I just hope that they can make movies better than this one. It's ok, but really only if you are already a fan.</p></body></html>

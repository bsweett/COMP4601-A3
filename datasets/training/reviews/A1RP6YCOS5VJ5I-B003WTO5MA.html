Ryan Reynolds really impressed me with his acting ability and I really did buy into and got into the storyline. The ending seemed kind of weak, but made sense. There was a build up, and a fizzle ending, but it still didn't hurt the overall film. So, I don't know if you will enjoy the movie if you expect a lot, but if you come in with low expectations-you can only go up from there. A real enjoyable movie that worth watching at least once, but I don't know if I'd want to see it more than that.</p></body></html>

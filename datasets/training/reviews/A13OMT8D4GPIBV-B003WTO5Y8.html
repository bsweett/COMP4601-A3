<meta name="summary" content="Hello Clarice"></head><body><p>Silence of the Lambs of a detective using a serial killer to catch another serial killer.  This movie contains two fo the greatest performances in the history of cinema, that of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter and Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling.<br /><br />This movie is so good it's almost overwhelming.  A definite masterpiece.  Jonathan Demme put together an amazing piece of film.<br /><br />The DVD has extras that, although underwhelming, are quite good.  There's a new documentary called "Inside the Labyrith", and also 20 minutes of deleted scenes, other featurettes, and even a collectible booklet.<br /><br />Definite Must Have.</p></body></html>

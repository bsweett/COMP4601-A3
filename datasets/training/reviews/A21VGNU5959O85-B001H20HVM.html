<meta name="summary" content="Better than the first but not by much"></head><body><p>I reviewed the first Saw movie, and unearthed it for what it was an amalgam of several other movies but it was not the perfect blend of all of them, more like a serious rip off. This sequel had to happen, because Twisted Pictures and the powers that be in Hollywood had a Bloody cash cow on their hands with all the minions of teenagers who wouldn't know original material if it reached out and snatched the Abercrombie hoodie off their backs. Again, thanks to the power of free DVDs at the library I grabbed SAW deuce and watched it with an open mind and lots of coffee of course. I actually love Donnie Walberg, I have since he took the one side of his manly overalls and let them hang while dancing with New Kids on the Block, so he was a good surprise. The story line is a basic one gruesome murder, similar to the first movies MO, a detective, and more victims but instead of individual attention they are all stuck in one house and slowly being poisoned, they have to find keys to doors, and search for antidotes, and figure out why they are all there. The SECOND I saw friggin Lucy from 7th Heaven I giggled with glee because the thought of seeing that pie faced whiner get offed in some gory way was like an early birthday present unfortunately she just slowly expired from the poison. The first Saw, had a twist that I didn't see coming, this one, not so much. Bringing a previous victim in (Amanda), especially one who professed to be "helped" by Jigsaw in the first was its biggest mistake. I knew she was in on the whole thing the second she woke up. The tests for the victims were lame, and we only get to see 3 of them really: the oven, the needles and the clear box, none of them made me want to look away, which is the telltale sign your scaring me or grossing me out. By the end I seriously cared more about Amanda surviving knowing she was one of the bad guys, more than the kid and the detective, mainly because Donnie Walberg was such a sucky parent and a crooked cop, and the kid because he was really the innocent I knew wouldn't die, Jiggy doesn't work that way he is such a moral man. So Saw 3 is coming out soon, and we all know that Amanda is now the puppet master, what I want to see is her lock up one by one Paris and Lindsay and Nicole and Ashley and Jessica and Brittney, take away all their phones, miniature dogs, fake tans, hair bleach, plastic surgery and make them choose between 15 minutes more of fame or their looks.</p></body></html>

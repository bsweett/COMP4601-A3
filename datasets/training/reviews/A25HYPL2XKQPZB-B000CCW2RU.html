<meta name="summary" content="A good movie"></head><body><p>The Island, the latest Michael Bay film, released in the summer of 2005 had a lot going against it.  First, it was a Michael Bay film.  Second, it had an original plot and was not a sequel or a remake.  Third, the title "The Island" seemed ambiguous.  I think this is definitely a movie you should check out.<br /><br />The first act is captivating, the world where these people live.  They work, eat, and live in an isolated area on the earth to protect them from the contaminated earth atomosphere.  At random times, a lottery is held to determine a winner.  This winner gets to go to the island, the last safe place on earth.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor as Lincoln and Scarlett Johanssen as Jordan are friends.  Jordan's name is drawn.  Before she departs for the island, Lincoln discovers something is drastically wrong.  She isn't going to the island, she is going to die.  Lincoln and Jordan escape and must be tracked down before the secret about the Island can be revealed.  The movie then procedes to be a standard action thriller with a few touching moments.  McGregor and Johanssen are great and this movie is worth watching for their performance and for the first act of the movie.  If the emotional ramifications of the Island, specifically Jordan's phone conversation with a little boy, had been explored more, this would have been even a better movie.</p></body></html>

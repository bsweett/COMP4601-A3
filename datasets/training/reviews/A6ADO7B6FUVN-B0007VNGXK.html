However, the Nazi's failed to get their hands on Hellboy as the Allies brought him to the United States to fight paranormal crimes.  Sixty years later Hellboy has to face prejudice because of his demonic looks in world that is not ready to accept characters such as Hellboy and his companion Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), an aquatic being.  Thus, Hellboy and Abe Sapien have joined forces with the FBI as they help protect a world unaware of their existence.<br /><br />Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm (John Hurt) discovered and nurtured Hellboy as his own son, which has brought out the sensitive side of Hellboy.  However, when Hellboy is not in contact with his sensitive side he is as cool and reckless as a small God should be as he goes about smacking down monsters and other demonic creatures in order to protect mankind.  Broom also has a terminal disease that prevents him from continuing to manage the organization in which Hellboy and Abe Sapien work.  This has led Broom to acquire a young FBI agent, John Myers (Rupert Evans), to be his successor as he believes he has the tools to keep Hellboy in balance with himself.<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro creates an in-your-face cinematic experience with Hellboy, which is based on the comic book, Hellboy.  It is inspiring that Hellboy has been filmed in the true sense of a comic book as it is lightheartedly switching between action, comedy, and a melodramatic love triangle.  This does not hurt the cinematic experience, but instead elevates it to a pleasant cinematic event where good fights evil.  At the end, Hellboy is a must see for comic book readers, superhero fans, but also anyone else who enjoys a warm action packed journey.</p></body></html>

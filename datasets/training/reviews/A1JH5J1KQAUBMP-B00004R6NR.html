<meta name="summary" content="A great dinosaur film"></head><body><p>Scientists learn how to recreate living dinosaurs via recovered DNA fragments, and a rich entrepreneur uses this knowledge to construct a prehistoric amusement park on a remote island.  He brings in a team to evaluate his living attractions, and from that point forward everything that can go wrong does.  <p>The lean, economical screenplay, by Michael Crichton and David Koepp, does just what it needs to--it moves us efficiently from thrill to thrill.  Only at the very end do the writers get sloppy.  In this movie, however, it's really the special effects that matter.  These dinosaurs live and breathe.  I remember when I first saw this movie in the theaters back in '93; I don't recall ever being so impressed with the technical mastery of a film.  Even today, when almost every film seems to include some CGI, the effects hold up very well.</p></body></html>

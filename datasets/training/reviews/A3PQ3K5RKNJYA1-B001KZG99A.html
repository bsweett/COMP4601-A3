<meta name="summary" content="One of Downey's Jr.'s Best"></head><body><p>Robert Downey Jr. has done some good movies these past few years; including some pretty esoteric stuff (Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang - Wonder Boys - Tropic Thunder) but he sometimes borders on the outrageous here as Tony Stark - In a good way.  His experimentation in the lab with his robots by his side, was particularly funny. He delivers a somewhat cool, calm yet lackadaisical approach to things when the pressure is on. He did everything right in this movie and I think that's why he's endeared millions more fans because of it.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges was extremely annoying and obnoxious as Obadiah "Stane" (was that a subtle hint?) and the "Iron Monger" who battles Iron Man in the final sequence. Which by the way, reminded me of RoboCop 2 (RoboCop vs Cain) and Edward Norton's "Hulk" vs. Tim Roth's "Abomination" battles.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Beginning of The Trek Movies..."></head><body><p>Some people regard STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE as a boring, and rather dull feature film. However, I feel that this is a great film, and the pacing may be slower than other Trek movies, but this has all the ingredients for a potentially great Trek movie. The only thing missing from this particular movie is more action (meaning, more ship-to-ship battles). But otherwise, this slow-burner is imaginative, intelligent, and remarkable in the visual effects department. And, more so in this updated version, the special effects are even better. Plus, you've got the thoroughly enjoyable cast from the original series and some newcomers aboard. <p>STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE is a good movie, as long as you are willing to have patience to watch it, carefully, and to realize that in the end, you can easily see why now 9 other movies have followed in the steps of the one that started it all.</p></body></html>

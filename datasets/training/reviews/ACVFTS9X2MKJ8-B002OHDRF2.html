<meta name="summary" content="I guess I'm suppose to watch the new Transformers film next?  Could it be worse than the first one?"></head><body><p>Well, this week I've watched three recently released action films.  And in my opinion, CGI is just over the top!  Movies just don't look real anymore.  They look just too animated and kind of fake.  I just watched the new Star Trek, G. I. Joe, and this new fourth installment of The Terminator saga.  The action scenes are now more intense, unrealistic, and overwhelming.  There is so much LESS story, human interaction, compassion, and drama, and MORE visual screen consuming effects.  They even had a computer animated Terminator of Arnold Schwarzennegger.  This goes to show that pretty soon, movies won't even need actors anymore.  Computer animators will create new movie stars (heroes and villains).  Technology, again, is removing the human element of upcoming future jobs and physical social interaction.<br /><br />And, about the argument about Blue-Ray over the standard DVD:  I know that Blue Ray offers a better High Definition picture.  So, if I got myself conditioned to watching Hi Def films, I will then see the reduced quality of all my regular DVD's, and I don't want that to happen.  I'm at a level of tolerance that allows me to enjoy all my regular DVD's.  Blue Ray would just start me on a journey of frustration because I have so many good movies on DVD, and I do not want to buy them again.  Even renting Blue Ray will open the door to hindering my appreciation of my own standard DVD's.  Ignorance is bliss for me.  Blissful, and affordable, because I am done buying movies.  I can put my money towards better things these days.  So, you people just keep buying your favorite movies, over and over again.  It's only money.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Matchstick Men (2003)"></head><body><p>Matchstick Men was probably the best movie that I had seen all year. I didn't find one part of it boring at all and found myself on the edge of my seat for a while. The ending had such a twist, I was confused for a while, then everything made sense. I rented this movie as soon as it came out and then bought it, its definitely worth watching again.</p></body></html>

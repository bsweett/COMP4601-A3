This movie is boring. It begins with a good premise, then everything goes down. And it's not funny at all. I don't know how it was advertised as a comedy. It's almost a total drama, with romantic obvious ending.<br /><br />The performances by everyone involved are great, and I was sorry that Paul Michael Glaser and Francis McDormand had so few time on screen. Keanu Reeves proved that there's life after his disastrous performances in both sequences of MATRIX (script's fault, not his, and Amanda Peet in very likeable as Keaton's daughter.</p></body></html>

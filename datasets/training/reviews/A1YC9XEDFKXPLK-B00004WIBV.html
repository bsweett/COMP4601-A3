<meta name="summary" content="Sleepy Shallow ?  Not !"></head><body><p>This version of Sleepy Hollow was not intended to frighten as much as it was intended to gross out or entertain. It even merits a comedy award at times. Is this bad ? By no means. Depp's semi-comical performance as the  easily grossed-out and chicken Ichabod Crane is a relief (from his stint on  the weak Astronaut's Wife).Christina Ricci, who played Katrina, is just as  skilled; She still needs to drop her Wednesday- Addams Family dead pan  facial expressions, though. <p>The GC effects are to be admired. This is  one decapitation film where the camera never leaves the victims or does a  cut away like in older films when the horseman is decapitating them; the  viewer sees a clean decapitation from start to finish. The location and  setting are amazing and really put the viewer back in time.  <p>For  nostalgic film buffs, there's even an English actor by the name of Ian  McDiarmid who has a small role in Hollow. Why is this actor so  interesting?...He's the evil and villainous Senator/Emperor Palpatine from  the StarWars films !</p></body></html>

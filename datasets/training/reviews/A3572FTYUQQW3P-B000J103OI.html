It seems to be a cross between a Docudrama and a Docu-satire.  Meryl Streep's performance is excellent and her scene as she announces her divorce raises her performance to its well deserved Oscar nomination.  The screen play does an excellent job of portraying the attitude of entitlement displayed by many top executives as Streep treats her employees as her personal servants.  She is a driven executive that has no life outside of her job and doesn't expect her employees to have one either -- they are there to serve her.  Like most senior executives she is ruthless, self-absorbed, and acts only in her own self-interest.  While this movie accurately describes my experience with senior executives the movie doesn't accurately portray the end game.  Ann Hatheway's character is living in a dingy apartment with some scuzzy guy who looks like he hasn't bathed in six months.  As she climbs the ladder and is exposed to the rich and powerful she is transformed into a player.  This is very logical and it happens but in the end she throws this away and goes back to the unkempt and unhygenic loser.  This was totally unrealistic.  I liked the movie but only gave it three stars because it fell apart at the end.  Once a player -- always a player.</p></body></html>

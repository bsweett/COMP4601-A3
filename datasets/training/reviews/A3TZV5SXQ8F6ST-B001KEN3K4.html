Former WWE Superstar Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson plays Agent 23 and the good guys are spearheaded by The Chief (Alan Arkin).<br /><br />It is a race against time for Max and friends to figure out how KAOS is getting its hands on nuclear weapons and piece together the devious plot to hold America hostage for a huge ransom. And through all the bumbling and stumbling leads to an ending with Max (oh, no!) trying to confidently get through the CONTROL security doors.<br /><br />The spy parody is a thriller and a winner.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A quality film"></head><body><p>This movie shines when telling the story of a rancher who brings some young kids just learning about life on a cattle run. John Wayne is at his toughest and kindest as he teaches lessons to the youth and has a deadly encounter. Bruce Dern as the [...] conveys meanness in a powerful way. Great simple lines between Wayne and Dern. A very touching story with good messages. Nicely filmed. A unique John Wayne movie, one of his best. You'll be surprised how it pulls you in, check it out.</p></body></html>

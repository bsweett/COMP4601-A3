<meta name="summary" content="excellent character study"></head><body><p>After having made a career out of playing every kind of good guy character imaginable, Tom Hanks finally gets to strut his stuff as a bad guy - of sorts - in "The Road to Perdition," Sam Mendes' excellent follow-up to his Oscar-winning "American Beauty" from 1999.  Of course, no one is ever going to believe Hanks as a TOTAL villain and this fact works perfectly for the role he has been called upon to play here - that of Michael Sullivan, a family man with two young boys who also happens to work as a hit man for crime boss John Rooney, an aging father figure who raised Michael as one of his own.  Sullivan's children, Michael Jr. and Peter, are in the dark as to just what it is their father does for a living, but when the older boy, Michael, witnesses one of his dad's on-the-job hits one night, he ends up putting both his and his father's lives at risk.  Suddenly, the two become fugitives, trying to stay one step ahead of the mob while Michael Sr. works on exacting revenge from Rooney's son, Connor, who both tried to have both Michaels rubbed out and succeeded in killing Michael's wife and younger son in the process.  <p>"The Road to Perdition" deserves immense praise for featuring a less-than-savory figure as its central character.  Apart from the Hanks persona, which confers a certain automatic likeability factor onto this gangster protagonist, the film also builds the case in Michael's favor by having him be so much better than anyone else around him.  With the exception of the crime boss himself, Michael is the only one of the killers who seems to have even an iota of redeeming value to his character.  However, the film does not flinch from showing us the brutal harshness of the life fate has chosen for Michael, nor does it absolve Michael of the guilt he obviously must accept for the actions he performs.  Unlike many films, "The Road to Perdition" does not shy away from acknowledging the ... complexities of the character with which it is asking us to identify.  Our identification is, however, instantaneous with Michael Jr. who witnesses all this first hand and who, as events unfold, comes to understand a little something about the universal nature of father/son relationships, about the teaching and learning that takes place in the course of filial bonding, about a father's hope for a better life for his son, and about a father's instinctive need to fight for and protect his own flesh and blood even at the risk of his own life.  And Michael Sr. learns a thing or two as well about what fatherhood is really all about.  Ironically, these truths are also reflected to a certain extent in the chilling relationship between John and his own ruthless son, Connor.  These two relationships provide some intriguing parallels and contrasts which help to enrich the overall theme of the work.<p>Despite the fact that the film focuses on the growing relationship between a father and a son, Mendes never allows sentiment to take over.  The few scenes charting the growing bond between the two Michaels are kept low-keyed and subtle and the movie erupts frequently into shocking displays of graphic violence.  One scene, in particular, in which the older Michael is ambushed in a hotel room, is extraordinarily suspenseful, executed with assured, split-second timing by director Mendes and editor, Jill Bilcock.  Mendes shows himself to be a master of the subtle moment as well, since the other great scene in the film involves a late night chat between father and son, a near-wordless encounter that underlines the growing love and respect that father and son are developing for one another.  The quiet, hushed tone of the scene provides an effective counterpoint to all the rat-a-tat-tat moments that might otherwise have come to dominate the proceedings.<p>The performances could not be improved upon.  Hanks manages to be both stolid and emotionally vulnerable as the father who realizes that, although it may be too late to keep himself from going to "perdition," it is not too late to keep his son from making the same mistake.  Newman creates a stunning portrait of an old man who can seemingly operate on two contradictory levels at the same time: one as a man capable of immense warmth and filial devotion to those he cares for and the other as a man ruthless enough to maintain his grasp on the life he's made and the position of power he's attained at any and all costs.  Jude Law achieves a perfect creepiness as the steely-eyed, sadistic and psychotic hit man sent out to dispatch both Michael and his son.  But the real acting honors go to young Tyler Hoechlin who manages to upstage even these seasoned professionals as Michael Jr., conveying in his every move, gesture and facial expression the innate innocence, warmth and intelligence of this 12-year old boy.  Hoechlin understands the quiet power that can be achieved through a look and a glance.  Wisely, the film's writer, David Self, makes young Michael an almost completely reticent character.  Most of the learning and recognition that comes to Michael over the course of the film is reflected not in his words but in his face.  As a result, little Michael is a character who lingers long in one's memory, for he ends up making an indelible mark on one's heart. <p>Mendes does an exquisite job capturing the bleak nature of the film's early-`30's setting, although one could probably do without some of the rather improbable Bonnie and Clyde parallels that the story unfortunately wanders into.  Still, that is a minor complaint about a film that works on so many different levels simultaneously.  Beautifully crafted and brilliantly acted, "The Road to Perdition" is a quietly powerful film that draws us into its world in a most interesting and persuasive way.</p></body></html>

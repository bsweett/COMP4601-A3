<meta name="summary" content="Well worth seeing but don't expect a Hitchcock thriller"></head><body><p>First, adjust your expectations and open your mind and you'll be fine as you watch this first-rate movie. Secondly, could reviewers please separate opinions of Mr. Penn OFFSCREEN from his performance ON SCREEN and just concentrate on the movie, the art itself? No fair panning a movie because you don't like the way a guy conducts himself at the Oscars - or whatever. Thanks.<br /><br />  Now, as to that movie... Nicolle Kidman plays Silvia, a U.N. interpreter and her motives are left somewhat unclear for a good part of his movie. Is she truly someone who has overheard what she should not and is the target of bad guys? Or is she possibly one of the bad guys, with her own, complicated agenda, one she can't own up to?<br /><br /> Penn plays Keller, a federal agent who is sent to figure out what is going on and separate truth from speculation and his emotional tension is palpable. In fact, tension, suspense and paranoia are major elements of this film, which was plenty strong enough to hold my interest.<br /><br /> But I was also riveted by the personal pain of the main characters. Keller has lost his wife, Sivia has lost much of her family (I don't want to give away too much of the plot so I'm being intentionally cryptic here, better you watch it unfurl yourself).<br /><br />  I'm sure the movie will get mixed reviews as it wasn't without flaws (it isn't formulaic and it does challenge the viewer; some people don't like that) but I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed it. It made me think of the ramifications of all sorts of political scenarios and "what ifs?" and it haunted me for days, burrowing into my subconscious and bringing up ideas and impressions at odd moments. I love films like that, the ones that stay with you long beyond the drive home from the theatre.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GREAT REMAKE AND VERY INTENSE!!!!!"></head><body><p>Amityville Horror this version is intense and very scary and it kept me on my toes the whole time that i saw it in the theater!!!!! Same story,but revamped a little bit and it has a wonderful cast like Ryan Reynolds!!!!!! Its about the Lutz family and they only stay in this haunted house for 28 days!!!!! If you are a horror buff like myself then when this comes out on dvd on October 4 then i do recommend buying this version on dvd!!!!!!</p></body></html>

Wrong.<p>Now when I wake up, the first thing that comes to my mind is, &quot;Gee, I could really go for a depressing movie that doesn't make me feel good at all.&quot; Seriously, this movie isn't &quot;art&quot;. It isn't good. Wonder why it didn't go to theatres? The reason this movie didn't go to theatres is because it relies too much on showing a depressive girl's obsession with some loner(Steve Buscemi in his first role that I haven't liked). The fact that anyone would want to see such a depressing movie amazes me. Even more amazing, people call this movie realistic and artistic. It isn't either of those things. It's just a movie that didn't make it to theatres and didn't sell that well on dvd.<p>In the end, this movie did horrible with the critics and being depressive isn't brilliant. It's depressing and boring.<p>But of course, people will defend it for some reason because it is apparently art. Any movies that don't go to theatre are brilliant!</p></body></html>

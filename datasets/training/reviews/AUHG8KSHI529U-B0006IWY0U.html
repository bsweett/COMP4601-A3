I enjoyed the "quiet" scenes where we are able to get to know the men of the Surprise.  The friendship between Aubrey (Crowe) and Dr. Mautrin (Bettany) is a glue for the whole movie.  The state of their friendship is a barometer for the state of affairs for the mission of the ship.  Being a musician, I loved the scenes of them passing time making music (and the raucous music of the crew as well).<p>Max Pirkus plays the 13-year-old Lord Blakeney with amazing skill.  His maturity reminds us of the time when children were not condescended to as creatures of little capacity and less responsibility as they are today.  Some may find such adult expectations of such a young person abhorrent, but given the life expectancy of the times to 13 was to be about a third of your lifespan.  They had to mature early and Lord Blakeney is a wonderful character with emotional strength, courage, and intellect beyond most adults.<p>There are two major battle scenes and a storm scene off the southern tip of South America that provide the action scenes of the movie.  They are wonderfully done and are quite rousing.  The scenes of surgery on the ship are filmed in a way that is not visually grisly, but so emotionally intense that you will want to look away because of what you might see, but don't.<p>I think it is always wonderful to capture a past time and place accurately.  While I am not a historian and I am sure that those historians who pay close attention to this period will find things to complain about, I did like the details they captured about the living conditions of a crew aboard such a confined space.  I don't know if all the details are right, but it was fun to watch a movie with details that added to the understanding of the plot rather than making one roll one's eyes at the implausibility of it all.<p>A great adventure bordering on an epic that is populated with people you would like to get to know and few you would treasure as friends.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Clockwork Classic!"></head><body><p>I like this movie because of the storyline and it's dark, creepy, and has the classic look of the 1970's. I had my mom watch it, and she hated it. It's very different from other movies. Do some research before you see it. If you like what it sounds like, then you should definitely buy it!</p></body></html>

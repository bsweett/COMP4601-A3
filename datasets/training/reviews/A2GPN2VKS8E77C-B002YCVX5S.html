"This Just Might Be My Masterpiece.""></head><body><p>Quentin Tarantino's follow-up to "Death Proof" is a scalpin' good time, and is a pleasant alternate reality of how World War II ended. Brad Pitt, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, Melanie Laurent & Christoph Waltz are pitch-perfect in their roles. Fun movie all the way through. Much better than "Jackie Brown," which was too slow for my taste. But "Pulp Fiction" & "Kill Bill" (I think of it as one movie) were absolutely spot-on, vintage Tarentino, and this glorious movie is right up there with them, ranking as one of his finest. It was also nice to see Achilles & Helen meet for the first time in a movie. The extended and alternate scenes are worth viewing; however, a commentary explaining why the scenes were cut from the film would have worked. SPOILER!!! I so did not expect Zoller to kill Shoshanna. SPOILER OVER!!! It would have been nice also if Shoshanna had killed the French traitor. Just my two cents on what I think should also have occurred in the film. I highly recommend the movie. Let's kill some Nazis. Rated R, but should have been rated PG-13.</p></body></html>

There are great action and fight sequences from beginning to end, with no drawn-out lulls in between.  The plot isn't all that great.  As a matter of fact, it's quite formulaic, as there is an all-too-common band of criminals with a plan that's setup for the hero to foil.  Yet it is done well in this movie.  The budget seems to be larger than that of the first film, making for more action and larger stunts.<br /><br />This is a good movie - definitely worth watching, especially for action fans.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Greatest film ever made"></head><body><p>This film is a complete gem and never sacrifices itself to mainstream vices. It has an all male cast, so is not ruined by an all too often pointless love interest inserted into the plot. It has mystry, horror, suspence, greta cting, great direction, plot and amazing special effects that are better than anything ive seen today. A great John Carpenter score to boot. This edition is packed with extras too.</p></body></html>

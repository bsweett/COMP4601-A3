The first film was The Illusionist, while the second film was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC55F2">The Prestige</a>. In my humble opinion The Prestige is a superior film mainly because of the film's technical execution under the watchful eye of director Christopher Nolan.<br />But I digress.<br />The Illusionist is a surprisingly engaging suspense film with strong supernatural or "fantasy" elements. Writer/director Neil Burger made the film on a relatively small budget, but this doesn't have a negative impact on the end result. On the contrary, The Illusionist is a better film than most supernatural thrillers because it relies on characterization to carry the story, rather than over-the-top action and unnecessary special effects. The few special effects in the film are subtle and understated, which in some strange way only makes them more impressive.<br /><br />The story is set in Vienna, during the dawn of the 20th century, where an illusionist named Eisenheim causes a commotion with his startling magic tricks. He soon attracts the intention of the social elite, including Vienna's own Crown Prince Leopold. Leopold, an arrogant, ambitious, and cynical man, feels threatened by Eisenheim's extraordinary abilities. He is outraged that Eisenheim knows more than he, and so as a ploy to reveal Eisenheim's methods, Leopold offers his fianc&eacute;e, the beautiful Duchess Sophie von Teschen to participate in one of Eisenheim's illusions. However, Crown Prince Leopold is ignorant to the fact that Eisenheim and the duchess were once childhood sweethearts and that Eisenheim made her a promise that they would one day be reunited. After Eisenheim's uncanny performance, he and the duchess rekindle their romance. When the jealous Crown Prince Leopold learns that the duchess has been unfaithful to him, he is consumed by jealousy and rage. When the duchess' body is found to have been murdered, the public suspects the crown prince has killed her, though they dare not voice their suspicions. But Leopold suspects Eisenheim's trickery played some part in his fianc&eacute;e's death, so he assigns Chief Inspector Uhl to uncover Eisenheim's secrets. Yet, Uhl is confounded when Eisenheim begins summoning disembodied spirits during his performances, and when Eisenheim conjures Duchess von Teschen's spirit on stage, the audience cries out that Crown Prince Leopold has murdered her. Fearing that a revolution against the monarchy may be at hand, Uhl doubles his efforts to unravel the growing mystery surrounding Eisenheim's abilities, the duchess' death, and what part if any that the crown prince had to play in her murder. But Uhl's investigation takes him deep into a world of illusion and conspiracy, where nothing is what it seems.<br /><br />One of the film's greatest strengths is the extraordinary ensemble cast, which features <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003W8NM">Edward Norton</a> as Eisenheim the Illusionist, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKOAA">Paul Giamatti</a> as Chief Inspector Uhl, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018O4YT0">Rufus Sewell</a> as Crown Prince Leopold, and Jessica Biel as Duchess Sophie von Teschen. While Norton, Giamatti, and Sewell give typically strong performances, the real surprise is Jessica Biel, who gives what may be her most complex and convincing performance yet.<br />Where the film fails ever so slightly is that director Neil Burger seems to be attempting to make some sort of a statement about the role that spirituality plays in politics. But this shortcoming is outweighed by the film's many superlatives. Employing numerous sleight of hand tricks to manipulate the audience's perception of the storyline, Neil Burger creates an ambiguity, which will leave viewers questioning whether anything truly supernatural occurred or whether the seeming magic that took place was just an elaborate deception. I'll let you decide, but remember: Don't believe what you see.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012OSGJK">Houdini: The Movie Star</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BGS17Q">Time After Time</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011E5M66">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AUHQR">Fairy Tale: A True Story</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BB152A">Criss Angel: Mindfreak: The Complete Season One</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDR8BO">Criss Angel: Mindfreak: The Complete Season Two</a></p></body></html>

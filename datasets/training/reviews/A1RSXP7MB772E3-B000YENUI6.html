<meta name="summary" content="Viggo and Cronenberg again"></head><body><p>Viggo is perfect and I think it is the first oscar worthy performance this year. There are some historic scenes in this movie that will blow you away. Cronenberg has always made great films for a specific audience, and it doesn't seem he has changed, only, more people are finding him. His endings are things to savor for. A history of violence blew me away, I think it's the best movie ending, period, I've ever experienced. Word of mouth is so much more important to me, and everyone i saw it with was jolted and excited outside afterwards. The last time I had this much fun was last year during that winter session when they always release oscar calliber movies.</p></body></html>

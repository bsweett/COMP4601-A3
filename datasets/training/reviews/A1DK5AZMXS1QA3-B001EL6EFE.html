<meta name="summary" content="Best cartoon of 2005; laughs for all ages"></head><body><p>Since Shrek, DreamWorks pictures has annually put out cartoons aimed at audiences of all ages.  Most of these end up behind Pixar's creations as best cartoon of the year.  2005 was one of the few exceptions; first, Pixar did not release any movie that year.  Second, this movie is actually very good.  It tells the story of four overly domesticated zoo animals who inadvertantly end up in Madagascar, where they have to learn to survive against the odds and in spite of themselves.  The movie is written as a comedy with no romance or terror, and some action sequences.  As a comedy, it includes elements of sarcasm, singing, slapstick and a lot of outright stupidity.  Most of the jokes are original and appropriate for all ages, and the animation is quite believable and looks like a cross between the CGI wonders of Pixar and traditional cartoon drawings from the 1960's.  The voiceovers are great, and all the characters are excellent.  Most notable is Sacha Baron Cohen's first big role in a major Hollywood release.  Here, he is the king of a band of lemurs, and his experience from the Da Ali G Show shines through as he sings away in a South Asian accent.<br /><br />Overall, a great movie.  The plot is simple but very original, along with the comedy.  Fun for everyone.</p></body></html>

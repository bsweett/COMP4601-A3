<meta name="summary" content="4.5 stars.  Odd, funny and surprisingly touching"></head><body><p>Let me say, first of all, that this movie is likely not what you would be expecting.  For a movie with such an extraordinarily odd premise, it isn't really very, I dunno, zany.  It's primarily a comedy, but it still has some genuine attempts at drama, and, as whole, takes itself a lot more seriously than you might imagine.  It's funny, though not riotously so, and has got a whole sorta tone and mood that I really enjoy.  Reviews of this are fairly pointless, I suppose.  If you're a Campbell or Coscarelli fan, you almost certainly want to see it, and if you aren't you probably don't.  But, I like this movie a helluva lot, so I'll go ahead anyway.<br /><br />For those who don't know, the basic plot of 'Bubba Ho-Tep' is this: An aging Elvis and JFK(who happens to be black) are living in an east Texas rest home, which is besieged by a soul-sucking mummy who is dressed up like a cowboy. (Personally, I think we are supposed to believe that Elvis really is him, but that JFK isn't, though you never can tell)  Thus, it pretty much falls into the horror-comedy genre.  It's fairly different from the other films of this sort, as it takes itself more seriously than any of the other films of this sort that I've seen, is not nearly as whacky or over the top as 'Evil Dead II' or 'Dead Alive', isn't as dry and deadpan as 'Re-Animator' (though it's more along those lines), and isn't interested in graphic violence, as are all 3 of those films.  And, when it does get more serious, it generally does so on a more conventional, dramatic level, rather than as a horror film.  Thus, fans of those films are far from guaranteed to like this film,  but most of that group still seems to, and it's nice that it pushes the boundaries of the sub genre a bit.<br /><br />'Bubba Ho-Tep' was directed by Don Coscarelli, the director who no doubt holds the record as the one who has has highest ratio of how many people have actually seen some of his films, versus how many people actually know his name. (He hasn't made many films, but the 'Phantasm' films and 'Beastmaster' have been absolutely all over cable for years and years.)  I've never actually watched 'Beastmaster' in it's entirety, but his real strength in the 'Phantasm' films is his ability to generate atmosphere, which is also his big strength here.  It's almost impossible to describe here, as it was in those other films, but it's really great.  Sorta vaguely surreal, but not wildly so, and wistful and sentimental.  This is greatly helped by the fantastic rock-based score, with a very nice and sad melody.<br /><br />The best moments of this film are both sad and funny, particularly Elvis' sad ruminations on his lost life,  the death of Kemosabe, and the final scene between JFK and Elvis.  Though the humor is derived from the  characters supposed identities, the film isn't condescending or making fun of them, I don't think.  It takes these guys seriously, and likes them. (As do I)  Thematically, the film is concerned with aging and the way that elderly people are ignored and patronized. Normally films of this sort tend to get a bit over-sentimental, but this one counteracts this with a fairly large dose of crude, lowbrow humor, most of which is quite funny, I might add. I don't know if most of this film is exactly laugh out loud funny, but it's all quite amusing, and I can't recall any jokes that really fell flat in a painful way.<br /><br />The film rarely really seems to be trying to be scary, but the horror scenes usually aren't purely parodic, I don't think.  They're just kinda weird, turned on their head, ya know.  And though they aren't scary, and aren't necessarily funny, they are, I dunno, cool. (Well, actually there is a shot of an old woman being dragged from Elvis's room which I find rather creepy, but that's it.)  Lots of people have complained about how Bubba Ho-Tep actually looks, but I think he looks great.  Sure he looks fake and all, but that's how it ought to be, and his whole cowboy outfit and hat is just quite amusing.<br /><br />The acting is spot-on.  Bruce Campbell is great as Elvis.  He's most famous for his physical comedy, which is largely missing here, as he is barely mobile, but he does his whole surly, pseudo-tough guy attitude as well as ever, and with a funny accent, to boot.  Ossie Davis is equally good as JFK.  He stretches the material just far enough to make it as funny as it can be, but restrained enough that he still seems like he believes what he's saying, and is still a real person.(If a most likely very delusional one.)  The supporting roles are all strong as well, though no one else has all that big of a part.<br /><br />The DVD is also quite nice.  The Campbell/Coscarelli was fairly interesting, and the documentaries I watched were more interesting than most.  There's also a commentary track by Campbell, as Elvis.  I haven't actually listened to it, but it sounds fairly intriguing.<br /><br />Well, that's it.  You already know if you wanna see this, so go ahead.</p></body></html>

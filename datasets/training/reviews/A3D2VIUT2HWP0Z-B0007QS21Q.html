<meta name="summary" content="Superb DVD"></head><body><p>From start to finish, this DVD  is just magnificent.<br /><br />The Sound is engineered superbly, and you absolutely MUST  have 5.1 surround to comprehend things.<br /><br />The cast is great, but the FX  are beyond great.<br /><br />This version of the film includes few extras ( technically one major one ), but the scenes are just brilliant, and each eye-popping surprise is just excellent.<br /><br />Aurally, and visually, a stunning work, that is worth every penny for the DVD. Crank up the sound too ... the opening credits are just great.</p></body></html>

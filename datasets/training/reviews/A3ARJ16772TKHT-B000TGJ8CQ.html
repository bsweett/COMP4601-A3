Admittedly, the ending can be feel like a cop out to many viewers, but it actually is very much in keeping with the general theme of the movie. Accept it for what it is and it's really not that bad an ending.<br /><br />Cage is, as always, very laid back in his portrayal, but that works very well for him. His magician persona works best when he gives no tell of what he is planning or what he has seen in the future.<br /><br />To put this in proper context, this movie is inspired by a short story by Philip K Dick, who wrote the stories that spawned "Total Recall", "Blade Runner", "A Scanner Darkly", "Paycheck" and "Minority Report".</p></body></html>

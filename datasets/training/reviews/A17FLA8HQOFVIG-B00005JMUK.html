<meta name="summary" content="Charlize Theron is a fine actor in every sense of the word"></head><body><p>This film is based on the true story of serial killer Aileen Wuomos, who was executed in 2002, Of course there is no way of knowing what exactly went on with each of the seven men who she murdered.  And there is no way of knowing about the details of the relationship between Aileen Wuomos and her young lesbian girlfriend Selby, played by Christina Ricci.  But it doesn't really matter because, due to the excellent writing and directing by Patty Jenkins, the characters come across as very real and very human.<p> <p>Charlize Theron is cast as Aileen in a performance that won her an Academy Award.  Whoever did her makeup should get an award too.  All her glamour and "babe-like" qualities are hidden.  And what comes out is the true actor inside of her in every sense of the word.  Every gesture, every expression on her face and every bit of anger and pain come through as authentic and real.  She's totally believable as the deeply troubled woman, damaged by life.  She's desperate for love and a little bit of happiness.  But she hasn't a chance.  When one of her customers seriously mistreats her, she kills him in self-defense.  After that she just keeps killing. <p> <p>As I recently saw the documentary about her life just a few days ago, I couldn't help comparing the films. Both were excellent.  But while the documentary left a lot of open questions, "Monster" answered them.  Therefore, part of my experience of watching "Monster" was trying to figure out what was true and what was not. But after a while I relaxed and just let myself get into watching the film for what it is.  And it's a truly fine film with outstanding performances.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

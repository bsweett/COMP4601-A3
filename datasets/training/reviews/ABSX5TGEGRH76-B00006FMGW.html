<meta name="summary" content="Be Sure To Catch This Flick"></head><body><p>The (almost) true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr.'s adventures as a juvenile con man has been made into a great movie.  Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank, who runs away from home when his parents are going to get divorced, and poses as a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and other praiseworthy professions in order to pass phony checks and win the hearts of girls everywhere.  Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent out to catch Frank.  The story is great, the acting is superb (Hanks's Boston accent is hilarious), and the jokes are great.  This movie is very clever, and you will be laughing long after you leave the theater (this movie has the world's greatest knock-knock joke in it).</p></body></html>

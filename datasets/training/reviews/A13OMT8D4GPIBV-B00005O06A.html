<meta name="summary" content="A Perfect Movie"></head><body><p>Citizen Kane is a wonderful story.  Most people of this generation have seen The Simpsons's episode "Rosebud" (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020SLO0">The Simpsons - The Complete Fifth Season</a>), and heard the ending just about every time the movie is mentioned, but this movie does a great job of holding your attention.<br /><br />There's a reason it's such a celebrated movie.  It is absolutely wonderful.  Kane's story is one that may not leave you breathless as some other more popular movies, but, just as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAA">The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)</a>, it builds an aura in itself that you must check out.<br /><br />Is it the best movie ever made?  That's highly debatable.  I wasn't as captivated as watching <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226055">Vertigo (Collector's Edition)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48SG">2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, and I may not have been as entertained as watching <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLV6">The Rules of the Game - Criterion Collection</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FSME1A">Apocalypse Now - The Complete Dossier (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a> but there is something about this movie.  One that leaves you visually impressed as well as intellectually satisfied.  It's not as fast paced as the movies of this generation but it will hold your attention to the end.<br /><br />This 60th edition two disc set includes two commetaries, one from reknowned director Peter Bogdanovich, and one from reknowned critic Roger Ebert.  Roger Ebert's commentary is the better of the two.  He sure knows a lot about films.  Other than a threatrical trailer there's nothing else to the first disc.  The second disc features the 1990's production "The Battle Over Citizen Kane" almost as long and entertaining as the movie itself.<br /><br />Definite Must Buy.</p></body></html>

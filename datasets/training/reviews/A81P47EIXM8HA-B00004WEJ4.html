<meta name="summary" content="a terrific alternative to the huge box set!!!"></head><body><p>If you don't want the big box.... a couple of previously released and worth once watching Warner Brothers pieces...then RUSH to buy this at Target where its is exclusively sold!  It has the new 70th anniversary print as well as the two new documentaries (which I recommend one on Michael Curtiz and the other on the film) as well as hours of the essential documentaries from previous editions and commentary tracks. I think Target sells it for $19 and I picked mine up there on sale for $14.... now I can live without casablanca coasters and a poster and all that other junk in fact I bought the big set and got rid of it when I found this superlative one disc alternative!!!</p></body></html>

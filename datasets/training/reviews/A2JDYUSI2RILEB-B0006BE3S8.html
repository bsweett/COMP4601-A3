His filmography is littered with good-looking, albeit brainless, genre flicks like "Resident Evil" and "Event Horizon". Still, Anderson knows how to construct a stylish looking genre flick, and his B-movie expertise makes him perfect for ALIEN VS. PREDATOR, an enjoyable B-movie mash-up of the Alien and Predator franchises which isn't -- obviously -- on the level of Scott and Cameron's classics, but isn't but for what it is.<br /><br />Granted, Anderson's film IS ridiculous, but after two tepid "Alien" sequels that each nearly ended that series -- not to mention a disappointing sequel that put a near- permanent hold on the "Predator" franchise -- the dumb comic-book action of "Alien Vs. Predator" comes as a somewhat refreshing surprise.<br /><br />Not that the movie's routine first half will have you on the edge of your seat, however. Anderson and Shane Salerno's premise follows a group of present day archeologists and scientists -- hired by wealthy industrialist Charles Weyland (Lance Henriksen, playing the human forefather to Bishop) -- into the Antarctic where an ancient temple has been found beneath the ice. The group, which includes environmental expert Sanaa Lathan, uncovers a strange chamber where humans were used as ritual sacrifices for...well, without divulging all of the plot, let's just say that Aliens and Predators were somehow involved in the development of human civilization and big game hunting simultaneously.<br /><br />"Alien Vs. Predator" is not nearly as ambitious as "Alien 3" or "Alien: Resurrection," yet it's more entertaining than both of those misguided flops (not to mention "Predator 2"), particularly once the film hits its midway point. When the Predators and Aliens finally meet, Anderson's movie delivers the outlandish action and effects you'd anticipate coming from the premise, and rolls its way to the finish line surprisingly well.<br /><br />Up until that point, the dialogue isn't especially interesting nor the scenario full of twists, yet I enjoyed the movie's visual design and special effects. Unlike the freakish make-up seen in "Resurrection" and the overall garish look of "Alien 3," Anderson seems to have gone back to the drawing board and utilized the design of the creatures from James Cameron's superlative "Aliens," in addition to H.R. Giger's original "Alien" conceptions, in establishing the look of the movie. There are also a few fleeting nods to those initial "Alien" movies (something that ought to please fans), but for the most part, "Alien Vs. Predator" stands on its own as an efficient, if unremarkable, late summer genre offering. The special effects are excellent and the final climactic battle between the Alien Queen, the Predator, and the last human standing is good, old-fashioned fun, well-edited and choreographed, and easily the best set piece of the "Alien" series since the conclusion of Cameron's 1986 hit.<br /><br />Early in the film, one of the "Wolf Man" films is seen playing on a background TV. It's a telling reference, since "Alien Vs. Predator" is not a film with much on its mind other than providing its audience with an entertainment that couples two well-established monster franchises. In its own way, it's not all that different from "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man" or any of the later Universal Monster team-ups from the mid '40s. It's a modern-day B-movie that knows what it is and provides a reasonably entertaining time for viewers who can approach it from the mind set that the material requires. (Now, if only Anderson had known when to quit and not tossed in that last groaner of a final shot!).<br /><br />Fox's Blu-Ray is pretty solid for an early format release. The transfer holds up decently, and BOTH cuts (unrated and PG13) of the film are included along with two commentaries and a trivia track.</p></body></html>

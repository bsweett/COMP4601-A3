I found them to be obnoxious and I can't for the life of me figure out why any woman would want anything to do with either one of them. They're not even good looking. However, what saves this movie is the bizarre family they get trapped with for the weekend. Christopher Walken, Rachel McAdams and Jane Seymour save this movie.</p></body></html>

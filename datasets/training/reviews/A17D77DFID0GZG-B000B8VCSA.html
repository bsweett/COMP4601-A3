There is nothing wrong with using the hand-held technique (there is a grittiness and realism to hand-held camera work), as long as one doesn't over do it.  A little goes a long, long way, especially on the big screen.  Fortunately, watching the BOURNE SUPREMACY on a TV screen didn't give me the headache I had in the theater.  It's really a shame the director didn't realize this, because overall, he did a heck of a job.  He kept the tension throughout, the fight with the other Treadstone agent was great, and the car chase was spectacular (including the camera angles within the car itself) ... that is ... if we could have actually seen these scenes!<br /><br />The Bourne series has terrific potential, and I really like Matt Damon's presentation of this super agent.  You can see this guy thinking all the time, no matter what mundane task he is doing (walking, talking, eating, etc.).  There seems to be a million things flying inside Bourne's head every minute of the day and it's a pleasure to watch.  It also doesn't hurt that there is something extremely compelling about a man on the run, and it's always been that way (cue in a hundred movies and TV series here, beginning with THE FUGITIVE).<br /><br />So how do I rate this film?  Considering how much I enjoyed THE BOURNE IDENTITY, I'd say that SUPREMACY is actually better, except for the problems stated (that and the fact I was disappointed with an early plot decision concerning Marie).  I would easily have given this a 9 out of 10, or a 5-star rating if not for the camera work.  Still, the story is that good, the acting is very solid, the locations wonderful, and the tension remains strong enough throughout for me to give it 7 out of 10, or 4 stars.  I'm eagerly looking forward to another installment.</p></body></html>

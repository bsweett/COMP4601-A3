It reminds us of what went on at ground zero when the cowards , aka terrorists, attacked us on our soil, but in doing so united us together, stronger... as well as taught us in the war against terror we need to bring the fight to the enemy. Great acting & a few real touching moments towards the end. The fallen NYPD & FDNY will never be forgotten - I admire their courage. The human spirit & will to survive are portrayed well in this movie. Brother helping brother no matter what the risk may be. God Bless the USA</p></body></html>

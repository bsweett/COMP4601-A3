Instead of adding scenes, in the Director's Cut they took out scenes. The studio told Oliver Stone to take more of the gay and hertosexual undertones out of the film so Colin Farrell will be more like Brad Pitt in TROY. This was Warner Bros. decision not Oliver Stones, so if you want the real director's cut get the original cut of the film with everything that Oilver Stone wanted in his film. You actually get more for the same amount of money, all the features are the same as the Director's Cut DVD but if you get the original cut you get a longer film. I know this is kinda confusing but I'll say it one more time, if you want the REAL director's cut of ALEXANDER get the original cut not the director's cut.</p></body></html>

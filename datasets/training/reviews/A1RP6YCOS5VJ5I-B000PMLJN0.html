<meta name="summary" content="A Really Good Movie"></head><body><p>Dead Silence, while not as good as Saw, is a great horror film in it's own right. I really think that the movie will get more popular as time goes on and is definitely something that should develope a cult following. With all of the mediocre horror movies being released recently, I really do think that this does stand out among them. It won't win any Oscars but should appeal to most horror fans. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but it does have it's moments when you know that something is going to happen and want to cover your ears. Overall, it is an enjoyable movie that I have seen twice and will probably see again. I recommended this to a friend and she loved it, so maybe rent it first. It's a cult film, so I wouldn't say that everyone will like it. But, when you do like it, you love it</p></body></html>

Not as good as the first two, in my opinion, but certainly entertaining enough for the discriminating gorehound. RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION returns us to the world become ruined by the T-Virus, which had given rise to zombies and other beasties. As the film catches us up, we learn that five years had elapsed since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767834739">Resident Evil - Apocalypse (Special Edition)</a>, and apocalypse indeed has arrived. Most of humanity has been eradicated, having been infected and become the shambling undead. The virus has now spread virtually all over the world, with even the forests and oceans having been tainted.<br /><br />Mobile pockets of humanity struggle to survive. The best way to stay alive is to be constantly on the move. And so, an armored caravan passengered by frightened survivors, led by hardy but beautiful Claire Redfield (a character pulled from the video games Resident Evil 2 & Resident Evil, Code: Veronica), ends up in a deadend desert motel in blighted Nevada, in dire need of replenishment. It's there that they meet Alice, whose motorbike had just "collapsed." It's not all new faces for Alice as she reconnects with Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr, THE MUMMY) and L.J. (Mike Epps), who are now part of Claire's security personnel.<br /><br />A journal found by Alice states that Alaska remains uninfected and thus provides possibly the last refuge on earth. I don't know why or how an anonymous journal becomes so believable to a pack of strangers, but, never mind. Alaska now becomes the new goal and hope for the weary and desperate survivors. But not if the Umbrella Corporation has a say in the matter. And it does. Yes, a powerful vestige of the Umbrella Corporation yet exists and still claims an immaculately attired staff. Numbering among that staff is one particularly manipulative, despicable, sick son of a - well, he's a scientist. And he dearly craves Alice for further experimentation as her blood has somehow reached an accomodation with the T-Virus. Cloning of her has thus far proved fruitless and a continuing waste of sexy red dresses. Thus paves the way for the unleashing of even more zombies!! Cor!<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION, this time stirring in a post-apocalyptic Mad Max element, satisfies with its short on dialogue but long on horror action theme. There's enough clipped exposition to explain the essentials, then it's on to the gross zombie slicing, chopping, and back-of-the-skull explosions. The film is typically brutal in its high body count. There's an air of bleakness found here, although it's not as extreme as in Romero's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IQNAG">Dawn of the Dead (Ultimate Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008G8L9">Day of the Dead (Divimax Special Edition)</a> (now that one was really grim).<br /><br />The difference, of course, is that in this end-of-the-world zombie saga, there boldly strides Alice, an honest-to-gosh superwoman onto whom we can latch our hopes. The stoic, ultracapable, and resilient Alice (now making full use of her psychokinetic gifts) can handily dispose of mutated deathhounds, backwoods lunatics, and flocks of predatory zombiefied crows, although it should go without saying that the main staple on her maiming menu is still human zombies. Milla Jovovich sexily graces the screen and has now imprinted on my mind as Alice to such an extent that any future role by Milla wherein she plays a mere love interest would render me severely discombobulated. And, mind you, I really liked her in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009AOBM">Kuffs</a>. Her role as Alice doesn't really call for any acting stretches, but she full out commits to her character and imbues her with enough soul and sensitivity that you do care for her. And, once again, Milla proves her physicality by once more doing her share of the stunts (she underwent training in the use of the intimidating kukri blades).<br /><br />This movie provides us with three strong and independent female role models: Alice, Claire, and Nurse Betty. Ali Larter (FINAL DESTINATION, HEROES) as the group's leader Claire and Oded Fehr as Carlos lend credibility to their scenes with a full investment into their roles. Ashanti doesn't wow me with her acting skills but her Betty does show great courage in the face of horrific adversity.<br /><br />But we all came to see harrowing monster action, and we get gory bucketfuls of the stuff. Impeccable CGI blends with nifty stunts. Throw in the hard-charging rock music to rev up the audience, and it's a can't lose recipe. On the downside, I must admit to feeling disappointment with the super zombies, who didn't seem all that "super." Other than one sequence in the lab in which one super zombie works a cell phone and shoots a camera before he goes berserk, I didn't feel that this breed was a marked improvement over the generic ravenous undead. As well the big monster villain near the end (a Tyrant-model from the video game) could've benefited with more screen time, to allow the audience to feel more invested in his eventual showdown with Alice. For sure, he gave her all she could handle, and then some.<br /><br />If this is indeed the last of the series, then, as a fan of horror action and post-apocalyptic adventures, I count myself content.<br /><br />But I do wonder if Alaska turned out to be uncontaminated after all.</p></body></html>

In many ways, this film is superior to "Goodfellows" which I also own in HD, not the least being--Sharon Stone!!  Her Oscar nominated and Golden Globe winning performance is worth the price of the movie alone!!  A previous reviewer downgraded her performance but I believe this is a personal bias rather an objective one!! Next to her "Basic Instinct" breakthrough, "Casino" shows that with a great director, Sharon can deliver the goods as well as any of the great femme actors out there like Charlize & Hillary who I also like.  Dig this in Hi-Def for the gaudiness and the scene where Ginger throws the chips in the air while DeNiro is entranced by her.  Keep in mind though that this is a Universal release and is only available in HD, so do cop a Toshiba machine before they're gone.</p></body></html>

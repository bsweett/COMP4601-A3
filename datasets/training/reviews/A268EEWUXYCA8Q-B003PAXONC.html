This Will Smith-led production is the third attempt Hollywood has made to adapt the brilliant novel.  None of the adaptions have truly done the novel justice (which is a shame), but this version has come the closest.<br /><br />Here we have a brilliant beginning; footage of a scientist (played beautifully by Emma Thompson) saying humbly that she's discovered a way to cure cancer.  Fast forward a few years, and New York is utterly devoid of human life, save for Robert Neville (Will Smith).  As the first half of the film progresses, we learn about his meager living, spending the day harvesting and trying to discover a cure, even now, while spending the night huddled in his protected home as creatures prowl.<br /><br />His only companion, a wonderful dog named Sam, protects Neville as Neville protects him.  They have a friendship based on loneliness and the human need for someone or something to hold onto.  Sam is Neville's only connection to the past and the only way to represent what little humanity is left, either in the world or Neville himself.  This period in the movie is pitch perfect, puncuated by one or two terrifying sequences that instill genuine horror.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the last half of the film deteriorates into an action movie that completely changes the meaning of the words "I Am Legend."  Don't get me wrong, it's mostly done really well.  Constantine director Francis Lawrence has a good handle on the action and delivers some good scenes.  But, it becomes muddled and veers off completely from the novel.  My biggest complaint, though, is the use of CGI.  Instead of using real flesh and blood actors, all of the creatures are created with CG and they look incredibly fake when lined up next to real people.  In the beginning, it's not a problem but as you see more of them (and you will) it's glaringly obvious.  And annoying.<br /><br />All of this I was expecting going in, though.  Considering that the film was co-written by Akiva Goldsman who also wrote I, Robot, I knew this version would stray from the source material just as I, Robot did.  As a movie, it's genuinely thrilling and creates the perfect balance of tension and action through most of its entirety.  And, surprisingly, Will Smith shows that he's a really good actor as he has to not only tackle many conflicting emotions during the two hour run time but he also has to do so without having much of anyone to react to.  Spending a good hour or so without another single actor for Will Smith to work with was a gamble and it paid off.<br /><br />Your enjoyment of the film is entirely based on what you bring to the table.  If you're coming to this film expecting to see the book come to life you'll be sorely disappointed.  However, if you're looking for a good action movie that actually has a good story and a human aspect, you'll be hard-pressed to find one as thrilling recently.</p></body></html>

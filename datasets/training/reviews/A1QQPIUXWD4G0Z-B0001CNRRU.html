<meta name="summary" content="Contrived Plot With No Theme"></head><body><p>This film has a rather unique plot arrangement with strong acting but all converge upon a non-existant theme. After a rather depressive two hours of drama, the audience is left wondering as to what the point of the story was.<br /><br />  Benicio Del Torro delivers a moving performance as a penitent ex-con who seeks redemption as a born again Christian. His conscience tormented between his duty to God, family, and society. Sean Penn seeks the wife of his heart donor to give his thanks but soon finds himself evoking painful memories and mixed emotions from the grieving widow. In turn, Sean Penn feels compelled to avenge the death of the widow's family by killing Benicio Del Torro.<br /><br />  At best, the film's theme shows that there is no simple truth to spiritual salvation in the bleak drama of human lives. The film shows that God punishes the innocent, the penitent, as well as true sinners and that none of us will ever really know why. Given the dramatic ending of Sean Penn's character, the film seeks to show that life is short and that we should be thankful for being healthy and alive, even if for a brief time. If that is indeed the film's message, it conveys it rather obscurely and unsuccessfully.<br /><br />  If you have to see this film, see it on video. There's nothing about this film that makes it worth seeing at the movie theater for $9; you also won't have to find yourself in an embarrassing situation if you fall asleep. Another advantage of seeing it on video is that you can pause it and try to study its elusive, if even present, convoluted theme.</p></body></html>

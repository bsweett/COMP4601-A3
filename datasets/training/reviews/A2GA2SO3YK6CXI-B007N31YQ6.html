<meta name="summary" content="A champion of justice... Erin Brockovich"></head><body><p>Erin Brockovich with Julia Roberts is a film about a woman who stands her ground against all odds, as the divorced single mother who works as a clerk for Ed Masry, an attorney played by Albert Finney and they join forces to champion clients that are wronged by a powerful corporation.<br /><br />Erin takes on the case against this corporation that is spoiling the environment with toxic substances, not only poisoning the water supply of a town in California, but also responsible for the illness and death of many residents.<br /><br />Erin is a woman who has lived through hardship, so she is able to relate to those suffering. She earns the trust of these clients, as they tell her all about their condition. Soon, we see Erin gaining ground against corporate greed and secrecy as she uncovers the details necessary to win a court case against the company that, while not returning individual claimants to health, at least they gain the financial strength necessary to withstand the consequences of exposure to toxic chemicals.</p></body></html>

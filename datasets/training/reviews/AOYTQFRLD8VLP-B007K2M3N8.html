Although he was about a decade older than the 60s crooner  ever lived to be, and his age showed a bit, Spacey (who successfully won an Oscar whereas Darin was only nominated for one) quite deftly engaged in the art of personification. He looks enough like Darin, although Darin's chin was narrower.<br /> Spacey helms an occassionally surreal  account of Darin's life, beginning with a backstage view of  his venue in Las Vegas, during which  the singer takes a detour, and presides over a telling of his own remarkable life story.<br /> Newcomer William Ullrich portrays the young Walden Robert Cassotto  (a.k.a Darin's not-so-inner child throughout the course of the film), a child of the Bronx who lives with Nina and Charlie Maffia (Bob Hoskins and Caroline Aaron) and the doting Polly Cassotto (Brenda Blethyn), from whom he inherits his  love of music. It would be years later that the singer would be devastated by the revelation of a  family secret.<br /> In the meantime, he builds his reputation as a performer, taking those closest to him along for the ride. He acquires a manger named Steve Blauner(John Goodman), and works his way from seedy nightclubs to more upscale venues. Spacey's recreation of Darin's signature performances  is admirable. One really has to listen hard to be able to differentiate between the original recordings and the reproductions made for this film.<br /> Tragedy strikes as Darin's recordings climb the charts. Still, the singer perseveres, making appearances on national televison, winning a Grammy, and beginning a film career, during which he meets America's Golden Girl, Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth), with whom he feels he can make  even more beautiful  music if he can lure her away from her  controlling mother, Mary Duvan (Greta Scacchi). Spacey shows impressive dancing skills in the process of getting the girl.<br /> Before long, Darin has won his prize, but in an emotional  scene that relies on a viewer's awareness  of Dee's survival of incest, the bride has an anxious moment, which her groom nobly redeems.<br />  The Darins have a son named Dodd, and the honeymoon ends soon enough during an Oscar Night brawl in which the couple become violent over incredibly petty issues. One feels dismayed that people who appear to have been given everything in life can't at least behave themselves!<br /> Still, as Darin strives towards his goal to play at the Copacabana, one may come to empathize with him since a childhood bout with rheumatic fever weakened his heart, and he knew his time was limted.<br /> As the 60s wear on, and social changes ensue, Darin, a politically  conscious entertainer who, earlier helped desegregate a nightclub, struggles to stay relevant. Amid Sandra's  increasing problems with the  bottle, and his being a hands-on Dad to his son, Darin refurbishes his act with songs that are more topical, and makes plans to join Senator Robert Kennedy in his bid for the Presidency.  Nina drops a bombshell on Bobby, regarding his family history (in order to beat the media to the punch), sending him into a tailspin, and he spirals even harder and deeper when RFK is assassinated.<br />  In real life, Darin could be be found lying at Kennedy's grave, but the film ignores this. It focuses on  his desertion of his family, his soul-searching, his reconciliation with his family(although it neglects to mention a short-lived second marriage), and  the triumphant revival of his career at the Flamingo in Las Vegas before the curtain prematurely falls...<br /> This film may be viewed some as a vanity project, as it was something Kevin Spacey had wanted to do since he and his late mother (to whom the film is lovingly dedicated) were fans of Darin's. He definitely dominates the project, but omits the presence of  Darin's half-sister, Vee, who was with him at the end. But it is an apparent labor of love in which Darin's ex-wife (who happily lived long enough to see the film's release) and son had some input.<br />  It does capture the salient points of Darin's life, and it's more than obvious that Spacey had fun playing off of the sassily precocious Ullrich, especally in the final dance number. I feel glad that Spacey's dream came true! He was born to play the part!<br /> The child from the Bronx may have died; the legend lives, and through the eyes of a devoted  fan, Bobby Darin is forever swinging at the Flamingo!</p></body></html>

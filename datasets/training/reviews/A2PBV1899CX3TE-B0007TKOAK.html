He wants to take his friend since college, Jack (Thomas Haden Church), on a wine tour before Jack gets married. Jack is anxious to sow a few wild oats before he gets hitched, and also wants Miles to sow a few of his own, so Miles can get over the depression of his divorce. Jack is a bounder, a bit of a cad, and an aging rake. He is an actor, primarily television, soap operas, and commercials. His career has peaked, though, and he sees marriage as his last chance. But before that ball and chain gets strapped on to his ankle, he manages to hook up with Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and fixes Miles up with Maya (Virginia Madsen). Together they will go on a double date that will take them through deception to ultimate truth, and for Jack and Miles, it will be a lesson in life, betrayal, and a chance for redemption.<br /><br />Sideways is a great film about 4 humans, each with their own good points and flaws. It was played by 4 actors, each with their own virtues and shortcomings. There was also a writer, who wrote a book that was turned into a screenplay by the director. The director was married to one of the actresses in real life. She was quoted as saying that her favorite rock musician was Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips, because he looked like her husband, Alexander Payne, and she could fantasize that she was married to a rock star. They married shortly before starting the film project, and divorced soon after. In an interview on NPR Sandra Oh said that it was all right working with a spouse, but on the way home from the set each night, they would talk about themselves in the third person. Alexander would say, "So, was the director being too harsh with you today?" I am speculating that some of the steamy love scenes might have created a lot of friction, that wasn't being resolved because of their oblique approach to conflict resolution, the third person discussions of themselves, the disguised arguments that must have come off like some kind of passive-aggressive Olympics.<br /><br />Sandra Oh gave an excellent performance in Sideways. Nowadays she plays Dr Christina Yang on Gray's Anatomy. I used to like the TV show, but the preposterous plots finally got in the way of my enjoyment of the strong characters. I stopped believing in it, I think, after Dr Gray somehow got her hand stuck on a bomb that might go off if she let go, while in the OR next door, another doctor's lover was having brain surgery, and then, they realized that all of the oxygen tubes that ran throughout the hospital would ignite if even a small bomb went off, it would start a chain reaction that would destroy the entire hospital. Puh-lease.<br /><br />I have been watching Oh work since she made The Diary of Evelyn Lau for Canadian television. Evelyn Lau ran away from home, and became a drug addict, a prostitute, and a poet and a writer. Out of 1,000 young women who auditioned for the role, Oh got the part, and gave a very memorable performance, so I wasn't surprised to see her turn up again in Sideways, and doing Oh so well.<br /><br />Her character in Sideways is Stephanie, a single mother who works as a bartender in a winery. She is very knowledgeable about wine, and also has a zest for living. Even though she may be a product of the wish fulfillment principle, she was a very real person, who was totally believable. If I met her, I might pinch myself, but there she was.<br /><br />Virginia Madsen, who played Maya, was also fantastic. Her brother, Michael Madsen, played a cold blooded killer who gleefully sliced off a man's ear while rocking out to Stuck in The Middle with You by Stealer's Wheel in Quentin Tarrentino's Reservoir Dogs. I guess acting talent runs in their family, because she was equally convincing in her role as a wine country waitress studying for her Master's degree in Horticulture (I am surprised that Miles didn't pun "You can lead a horticulture, but you can't make her think" at that point). She not only feigned attraction to Miles, but also gave an excellent monologue about how much she loved wine, and how she came to realize that she loved wine.  She was too good to be true, but there she was.<br /><br />Alexander Payne did a great job of directing. Repeated viewings constantly reward you with new details and insights into how well the story was paced, how the momentum flowed, how little details were juxtaposed to either counterpoint or enhance the main action. The settings were all so well chosen. California, from Los Angeles to the little wine country towns. The wineries, the Wind Mill motel, the golf courses, The Hitching Post restaurant. There seemed to be a bit of a wind mill motif running through it all, as if they were on a quixotic journey, and The Hitching Post was a foreshadowing of Jack's eminent marriage. One scene in a restaurant with elaborately carved woodwork in the faux Danish town of Solvang was reminiscent of Pinocchio and Lampwick before setting off to Pleasure Island. Another scene was filmed in a run down house that had recently been a meth lab, and was left intact, except for a new door that replaced the one the cops busted down. The cinematography was excellent, with colors that were almost pastel, or depending on the mood, dark and foreboding. Payne takes risks, making Miles and Jack do despicable things, daring you to not care about the characters.<br /><br />Thomas Haden Church has a life that in some ways parallels his character Jack. He is an actor who has appeared in sitcoms, maybe not soap operas, but he was the mechanic Lowell on Wings, and played Ned in Ned and Stacy. Wings wasn't a very good show, but he was someone who really stood out. You just knew that if only he had the right vehicle, he could really shine. Sideways is that vehicle. There are so many great scenes and little touches that make his character come to life. The way he praises the latest draft of Miles' novel, though he obviously hasn't read it. The way he keeps three condoms for himself and gives Miles one when they all end up at Stephanie's after their double date. And then later the next day, takes it back. And for this, he was nominated for an Oscar.<br /><br />Miles is exasperating and pretentious. As they embark on their journey, they stop off to visit Miles' mother. He steals money from her. How can you care about someone who would do that? He is passionate about wine, especially Pinot Noir, and seems sincere and genuine, but is an alcoholic, or at least using wine to escape from his problems--one of them being excessive drinking. Paul Giamatti is perfectly cast in this role. He has the middle aged paunch, the bald spot, the pretentious bohemian goatee, and a flair for physical comedy. He played Harvey Peckar in American Splendor, and has that quirky, awkward, misfit kind of character down. He can go from funny to sad in 60 seconds. There are lots of great scenes and little touches that make his character come to life, like the way he sprinkles his vocabulary with French, does crossword puzzles from the New York Times in pen, and refuses to drink Merlot, because it is too prosaic, too much the worn out clich&eacute;.<br /><br />If Sideways was a bottle of wine instead of a movie, it would be Pinot Noir, not Merlot.</p></body></html>

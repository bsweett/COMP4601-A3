A fifth grader would find this film overly predictable.  You know exactly what you are being set up for 15 minutes before each scene.  The supporting cast is pathetic, and didn't find myself liking any of the characters except for Terry Bradshaw.  He was hilarious.  I expected more from Kathy Bates, who is an excellent actress(see Misery).<br /><br />Save your money and rent a movie with more meaningful and serious themes like "Syriana."</p></body></html>

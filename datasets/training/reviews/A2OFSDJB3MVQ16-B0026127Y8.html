<meta name="summary" content="Liam goes into action mode to rescue his daughter!"></head><body><p>I was skeptical when I heard that this movie would be produced by Luc Besson (The Professional, La Femme Nikita), the go to man or the French Joel Silver of action movies since some of his films have been hit and miss.  This turns out to be a hit (it's already grossed $143 million thus far) thanks to the casting of Liam Neesom (Schindler's List; Rob Roy).  A physically imposing actor of great presence, Neesom brings this physicality to the role of an retired CIA man brought back into action when his daughter is kidnapped in Paris.  What ensues is 97 minutes of breakneck action and Neesom is totally convincing in this role.  It may lack the complexity of the Bourne series but if you like your action movies to be lean and mean--this is the flick to see!!</p></body></html>

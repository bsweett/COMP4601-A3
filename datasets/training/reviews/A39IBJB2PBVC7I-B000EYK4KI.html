<meta name="summary" content="Almost As Exciting As Its Title"></head><body><p>Interestingly enough, this plot was made into a movie several years ago using real actors. Prizzi's Honor, with Jack Nicholson and a then scrumptious Kathleen Turner was smart, sophisticated, funny, and surprising.<br /><br />By contrast, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, little more than a vehicle for two well recognized faces, is dumb, puerile, drab, and almost frighteningly predictable. The meager hopes of this packaged Hollywood frozen dinner rest exclusively on the shoulders of its co-stars, and any alleged "chemistry" between them. That there is none dooms the effort, even the "hot reconciliation scene" in the kitchen looks staged and false, creating enough warmth perhaps for a weak cup of tea but not quite enough to poach an egg.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie's lips seem to be on the verge of taking over her entire face, while Brad Pitt, who still looks like he's about 12 years old, is unconvincing in a part clearly written exclusively for him. Viewers are expected to forgive far too much in this glossy bubble of vapor. The plot is beyond ludicrous, the performances lethargic, frequently the scenery threatens to walk off with the movie.<br /><br />Mission Impossible settings and a pretty darn good car chase prevent one from going to sleep, but cannot redeem this effort. Those who would defend it by saying, "It's not La Strada, for heaven's sake, it's just an action adventure thriller", are forgetting that thrillers are supposed to be thrilling.</p></body></html>

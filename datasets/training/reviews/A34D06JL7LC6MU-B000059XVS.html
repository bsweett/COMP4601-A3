A biopic, that's about 20 minutes shy of 4 hours long and is on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#5). When talked about, most people mention that this movie (to be truly appreciated) must be seen in a movie theatre. Roger Ebert said "[It is now] on video, where it crouches inside its box like a tall man in a low room." Watching the film and it's imagery, it's clear that a movie theatre would do the best justice to it...But few people will actually have a chance to see this in the theatre. When the movie came out in 1962, it won a slew of Oscars including Best Picture but was almost lost forever. The original negative's were found in crushed and rusting film cans and have since been restored to what it is now. Hard to believe since the picture in this film looks so good, it could have been filmed last year. The movie stars Peter O'Toole as the title character T.E. Lawrence. I'd heard of O'Toole before seeing this movie, but had never seen him in anything. He's an actor like William Hurt or John Malkovich. He has a very peculiar speech pattern that fascinates you the first time you hear it (and sometimes even the 100th time). The movie opens with Lawrence getting into a motorcycle accident and dying. At his funeral, people discuss him...Saying nice things about him and less-than-nice things about him. But no one truly seems to have known him. The movie flashes back and we learn that Lawrence was a soldier in Cairo, who was sent into the Arabian Desert where he would lead a revolt against the Turks. Despite the fact the movie is, essentially, a biopic...It's not big on plot. There is a plot in the film, but there's not a whole lot to write about on the subject. Along the way, Lawrence befriends Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif, who's terrific) and Prince Feisal (Alec Guiness, barely recognizable). And even Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn). Claude Rains (Louie from Casablanca) is also in the film. In my personal opinion, Lawrence of Arabia is, above all, one of the most beautiful films ever made. Its cinematography is almost poetic in the way it pans over the vast desert landscapes. The score of the film is almost ironic. It's an over-the-top heroic score that would seem more suited for a movie like The Mummy Returns. It works here though and makes these scenes even better. The movie is well acted and truly deserves the title of "one of the best films ever made." Whether I'd ever watch it again, however, is a different story. If it played at my local multiplex, I'd definitely go...And it's not a reflection on the movie itself that I wouldn't watch it again, merely it's length. It's easier for me to find time to watch 3, 2-hour movies than it is for me to watch 1, 4-hour movie. It's a great movie, though, and one that people should definitely see. If you haven't seen it, I'd recommend renting it first and then making a decision on whether you should purchase it or not.<br /><br />Grade: A<br /><br />Cinematography: A++</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hey, Where's that Great Film We Saw in Theaters?!"></head><body><p>Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's legendary and classic horror film HALLOWEEN (1978) is absolutely outstanding.  Remaining basically loyal to the original and tampering with the basic plot in only minor ways, Zombie's contribution is to provide a back story to the famous serial killer that simultaneously makes him more human and more unnatural...and therefore much scarier!<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Unrated Director's Cut on DVD is not the same film that was offered to horror fans in theaters. More than just added footage that had to be cut in order to receive an "R" rating by the MPAA, this Unrated edition actually contains alternate scenes that replace the theatrical ones and, in many ways, make the offering a totally different film. Unfortunately, the alternate scene on the DVD that explains how Michael Myers escapes from the sanitarium is much weaker than the one used in the theatrical version, and it therefore makes the film on this DVD a much weaker flick. Alas, the original scene is not even included as an extra on the disk and is missing altogether, and a few fans that missed the film in the theater run don't realize they are watching a different film.<br /><br />Rob Zombie deserves the kudos he's been getting for creating a fantastic new vision with his remake, but sadly the film for which he earned those kudos is not the one on the Unrated Director's Cut DVD.  Zombie should be chastised NOT delivering that great remake to his fans for home viewing.<br /><br />The four-star rating is for this DVD, not the real film fans saw in theaters last fall.  Alas, Zombie's true work of art is currently only offered in the vsiually butchered 1.33:1 Wal-Mart Trailer-trash version, but fans won't find it on the Unrated Director's Cut.  Fans who want to revisit the great vision they saw in theaters can only hope that it will someday be released on DVD in widescreen...perhaps as a part of some ultimate edition package.</p></body></html>

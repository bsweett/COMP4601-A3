I hadn't seen the old one in so long I can't remember much about it except the basic plot premice of curse, fog, ghosts, ship, scream, kill, scream. The new one is about the same if you go by my description of my memory of the first one. Selma Blair is just a really bad actress. She is monotone and has no charisma and delivers her lines like she is zonked on prozac or something. The Smallville guy is the main hero and he isn't very good either. The rest of the cast is pretty blah too. This is a straight forward ghost story, no gore and little effects. In some ways that is refreshing cause I don't think a horror movie has to be all blood and guts and shock. But this movie just isn't that great. Its worth watching but not great... not sure its really good either though. Rent it before you think about buying.</p></body></html>

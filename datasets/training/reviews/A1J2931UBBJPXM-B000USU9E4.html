With so much happening all the time, everywhere, and with so many different ways to go, people have become preoccupied, which can be dangerous if the momentum propelling an individual happens to come to cross purposes with that same kind of momentum driving another, and the two converge.  And it happens.  "Things" happen; and when they do, the important thing is that all parties involved react responsibly and focus their individual attention on the matter at hand.  If either side fails in this regard, it can mean big trouble.  it means you suddenly have a situation; and it's just such a situation that is explored by director Roger Michell in "Changing Lanes," a tension filled drama starring Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson.<p> Gavin Banek (Affleck) is a successful lawyer, a partner in the firm and married to Cynthia (Amanda Peet), the daughter of his boss, Stephen Delano (Sydney Pollack).  He's currently handling a probate case worth millions to the firm; he's due in court, where he simply has to present a document that will, for all intents and purposes, wrap up the proceedings.  But fate is waiting in the wings.  In another part of town, Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson) is also about to wrap up a deal-- a loan for a house that will keep his estranged wife, Valerie (Kim Staunton), from moving with their two boys, Stephen (Akil Walker) and Danny (Cole Hawkins), to Portland, Oregon, or as Doyle sees it, half way across the world.  <p> When Gavin and Doyle get into their respective cars to head to court, they are strangers to one another; they are about to meet, however, when heavy traffic on the expressway and their own preoccupied mental states precipitate a collision-- a minor car accident that ultimately effects a much bigger wreck in both their lives.  In his rush to meet his appointed court time, Gavin leaves the scene of the accident and, more importantly, leaves Doyle-- who also has an appointment in court (his child custody hearing, no less)-- stranded, and out of time.  Ironically, the document Gavin must file in court is inadvertently in the confusion of the accident left behind on the expressway, and is now in Doyle's hands.  And so the conundrum; loss of the document may mean jail time to Gavin.  To Doyle, the loss of twenty minutes may mean losing his children.  The question now is, how will these two men solve their dilemma?  One has what the other needs, but how do you give "time" back to someone?<p> This film, nicely fashioned by screenwriters Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin, and extremely well crafted and delivered by director Michell, is at it's core a character study that examines the effects of desperation and the emotional responses elicited thereof.  It explores how anger and frustration can in the heat of the moment negatively affect even an individual who under normal circumstances is predisposed to abiding by his own conscience; how even the most rational among us has the capacity for irrational behavior if provoked by unmitigated circumstances.  At one point in the film, one of the characters observes that it's like two guys have been dropped into a paper bag together and shaken up, just to see what happens; and that about sums it up.  And Michell does an excellent job of keeping the story on track, setting a good pace and maintaining the tension that keeps the audience involved.  It's straightforward storytelling that is well presented and effective.<p> As Gavin, Affleck gives a solid performance, developing his character quite nicely as the story unfolds.  When the film begins, Gavin is in a comfort zone, a place that allows him the tunnel vision necessary to do what he does with a clear conscience.  In a way, he's naive; a guy who's been led down the path and made to believe that all is well in the land of the free.  By the end of the film, we see a different Gavin-- or at least an "awakened" Gavin; the same man, perhaps, but with an entirely different perspective on life.  And Affleck's portrayal makes it convincing, and brings Gavin to life in a very real way.  A good job by a fine young actor with the ability to tap into that emotional depth that makes his character believable.<p> Samuel L. Jackson hits his stride, as well, as Doyle, a character whose outward demeanor masks the complexities lying beneath the surface, but which Jackson brings incisively to light.  Doyle is your average guy, an insurance salesman, but a man plagued by the demons of addiction; he's a man addicted to chaos, evidenced by the failed relationships in his life and his inability to cope with the situation engendered by his encounter with Gavin.  Jackson creates a character with whom you can empathize, even as he makes you aware of the rage within him that could explode at any minute.  Doyle understands only too well the dire, probable consequences of being unable to quell his anger, and through his portrayal, Jackson makes the audience aware of it, as well; and it's a pivotal point in the story, which he successfully conveys.  And it's that unstable element of Doyle's personality that makes this more than just a story about right or wrong, or who's going to win; it means anything can happen, and it keeps you wondering right up to the end what that something is going to be.<p> The supporting cast includes William Hurt (The Sponsor), Toni Collette (Michelle), Richard Jenkins (Walter), Tina Sloan (Mrs. Delano), Ileen Getz (Ellen), Sam Rovin (Paralegal) and Jennifer Dundas (Mina).  A morality tale that, be advised, does not take too kindly to lawyers, "Changing Lanes" is an engrossing film that delivers much than what is promised, even, by the trailers; a worthwhile cinematic experience.</p></body></html>

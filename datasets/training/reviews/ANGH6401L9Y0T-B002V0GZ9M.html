<meta name="summary" content="Charming Time Paradox Story"></head><body><p>A tender little story with a deceptively simply premise. Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) leaves her lake house in 2006, and leaves a note for the next tenant. Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) finds the note when he moves in in 2004. Oooops! We never get a good explanation about how they got a bit turned around in time, but it seems they can correspond using the mailbox at the lake house. It doesn't take long to realize that they have the same dog -- a female named Jack -- and that Jack is living in her own time. She seems perfectly capable of accepting and living in the anomalous situation.<br /><br />After they've exchanged correspondence for awhile, they try to work out a way to meet in person. But it's not as easy as it sounds. Do they eventually make it? How?<br /><br />Ain't gonna tell you. It's sweet. Really.</p></body></html>

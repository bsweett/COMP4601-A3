<meta name="summary" content="Appealing Cast, but the Musical Numbers Lack Pizzazz."></head><body><p>"Mamma Mia!" brings the wildly successful ABBA-inspired stage musical to the screen with a cast of actors who don't usually sing or dance. The film retains the behind-the-scenes talent from the stage show: director Phydilla Lloyd, producer Judy Craymer, writer Catherine Johnson, and score by former ABBA member Benny Andersson. It adds one song and leaves a few others out, but this is very much a transfer of the stage musical to the screen. A young woman named Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) plans to marry her beau Sky (Dominic Cooper) and dreams that her father will be at her wedding to give her away. But Sophie doesn't know who her father is. Twenty years ago, her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) had summer flings with three men. Sophie invites all three to her wedding in Greece in hopes that she will recognize her father. But when Donna sees the men from her past, she's sure that they will ruin the wedding.<br /><br />There's hardly any point in mentioning that the set-up for this musical romp in the Greek Isles is silly beyond words. But the three candidates for Sophie's paternity are appealing guys, and the actors are game: American architect Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), British banker Harry Bright (Colin Firth), and Swedish adventurer and travel writer Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgard). The men are counterbalanced by a trio of sprightly middle-aged ladies: Donna and her friends Rosie the author (Julie Walters) and Tanya the serial divorcee (Christine Barnasky). These are fun characters, and I enjoyed them. I wish I could say the same for the younger set. Amanda Seyfried has a nice enough voice, but Sophie is annoying and seems more like a 13-year-old than a woman of 20.<br /><br />The musical numbers are dull. I partly blame the lack of vigor on the locations. This is a jukebox musical, so the songs are not integrated into the plot as seamlessly as they would be if the music had been written for the stage. And since this is a movie, filmed on location in Greece, they don't have the benefit of an intimate venue. On stage in a small venue, energy would be flying off the stage. In these wide open locations, further muted by transfer to the screen, the musical numbers fall flat. I kept hoping that the next scene would not be musical, because the stuff in between was reasonably charming. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that most of the principle cast is over 50. Generally an appealing cast, even if they are not the best-suited talent for a musical, but unfortunately, the music that's supposed to be the selling point is the film's weakness.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2008 single disc): The single disc edition has the option of viewing a Sing-a-Long version in which the lyrics to the songs are displayed across the screen during musical numbers. There is one deleted musical number called "The Name of the Game" (3 min). And there is a feature commentary by director Phyllida Lloyd. She talks about locations, some photographic techniques, characters, cast, filming, her approach to the musical numbers, and various technical details. Subtitles are available in English SDH, French, Spanish. Dubbing available in Spanish, French.</p></body></html>

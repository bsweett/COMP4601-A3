With the phenomenal success of the comic book series it was only a matter of time and slicing of red tape before this film was made.  The result is about what you'd expect.  Having read and collected a few of the comics in years past I knew that if the film was done right it could be an entertaining ride.  I was a little surprised to find myself geniunely concerned for at least half the humans caught between the monsters.  However, nothing can save the film from eventual plot failure.  Not even some elegantly brutal fights between the beasties, which were staged effectively and were easily among the brightest parts of the film.  There is actually too much plotting going on, some of which purists of the orignal films will shriek "Blasphemy!" when they hear it.  There are some creepy moments, at least for viewers who know what squirms within those as yet unopened eggs.  There are even some humorous scenes, as in "nervous laughter," where you know the character is doomed but he doesn't.  Early on in the film, however, characters were jumping at shadows for no reason.  The creatures hadn't been introduced yet but the director thinks that the audience will somehow buy into the shock tactics anyway.  Not this audience member.  What carried me to the end of the film were the visual effects, some of which are excellent CGI creations worth a second look some day in the future.  But the story truly falls apart when one of the human characters befriends a Predator.  Right.  That's believable.  I could go into all the reasons why I think that shift in the plot is ridiculous, but other purists will understand.  When two franchises are floundering they stay afloat through a merger, combining their forces in the hope of regaining the glory days of the past.  There will never be another "Aliens."  There will never be another "Predator."  All the sequels that followed both of those landmark Sci-fi creations are evidence of diminishing returns.  Why get creative and come up with another fiend that enchants the throng when you can rehash old monsters and basically beat a dead horse?  I would expect nothing less from Hollywood.  To take a quote from the film "L.A. Confidential":  "Something has to be done.  But nothing too original.  'Cause hey! this is Hollywood!"  The visual effects are good, but the plotting and toying with the respective mythologies will drive purists into a frenzy.  This film is only a rental.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DALLAS!  ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T SEE IT?  I MEAN IT HAS TO BE RIGHT THERE.  UM!  ALRIGHT I-I WANNA GET OUT OF HERE."></head><body><p>Um! I want to get out of here spoken by actor Tom Skerrit who<br />plays Captain Dallas was ONE of the best scenes in HORROR film<br />history. You can really feel for Tom Skerrit for he is scared<br />and has every right to be. When you have a slender 9 1/2 ft.<br />tall alien after you....YOU BEST BE SCARED!  Alien is ONE of the<br />greatest HORROR (did I type HORROR? But this is SCI/FI...IS IT???)<br />films to be made. It really is a HALLOWEEN in space. The spaceship<br />is the MYERS house the crew are the teenagers and the big bad alien<br />Mike himself. I really loved how Director Ridley Scott built the<br />tension in this movie and gave us great character development as<br />well as SCARES.  This is one of the first TERROR movies to not show<br />the survivor girl not to be a whiney wimp.  If action is what you<br />crave than recommend ALIENS(HUH! Did Clint suggest a sequel??? Hey<br />Aliens is good for a ACTION movie)but if you like slow building<br />heart pounding TERROR! Than Alien is for you my friend. I will<br />def. give this a FRIGHTFUL watch this Oct.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A movie done by rote"></head><body><p>There really isn't anything original or surprising in this entire movie.  It provides by the numbers, rote suspense.  It doesn't exactly INSULT the intelligence of the audience...but for the most part, it doesn't exactly require a careful following of the plot twists either.<br /><br />But it's a Harrison Ford film, and there was a time when that alone was cause of celebration.  However, it's been a long time since there was a good Ford movie, and FIREWALL ain't it either.  Even in some of his poorer films of the past though, he was at least entertaining to watch.  Thinking back on HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE, which was a real mess of a film...constant changes in tone, loose pacing, Josh Harnett...Ford at least was amusing and his charisma helped a lot.  We brought our own good feelings about him to the film.  In FIREWALL, it's tough to like him.  Ford himself seems tired and disinterested...he's going through the motions.  And if we don't care about him, it's hard to care about his hastily sketched family either.  And if we don't care about them...well, it's just hard to care much about the film.<br /><br />There are some bright spots to keep this from being a totally forgettable film.  Paul Bettany makes a nice villain overall.  The character is written in very generic fashion, but Bettany, who is normally SO likeable (WIMBLEDON, MASTER AND COMMANDER) makes his intelligent bad-guy neatly creepy.  Sadly, during the final scenes of the film, all pretense that this guy is cool-as-a-cumcumber go right out the window and he becomes totally generic.  Not Bettany's fault...the script essentially abandons him.<br /><br />Also, Mary Lynn Rajskub essentially reprises her role from TV's "24," but it's such a fun character that she's very welcome in FIREWALL.<br /><br />The always wonderful Alan Arkin, as well as Robert Patrick and Robert Forster are all pretty much wasted in very generic roles.  They add a little class to the movie, but it's just a sheen that brings no extra substance.  Virginia Madsen is also a very welcome presence, but the part of "the wife" will hardly be in her list of most memorable roles.<br /><br />The action sequences are tame.  It's mostly one of those movies where things are one close call after another.  For awhile, Ford is simply trying to let someone know he's in trouble without the bad-guys knowing he's telling anyone, and those moments offer the most fun of the film.  They are small-scale and believable...we can almost feel him thinking of what to do next...refusing to believe he's been outsmarted.  Later, when the plot thickens, it becomes more unbelievable and losing its tenuous grounding in reality.<br /><br />So, I will continue my wait for a Harrison Ford movie worth seeing...you should wait too, rather than seeing FIREWALL.</p></body></html>

Reading some of the more negative reviews the resevations about this film seem to center on the use of a preteen (Chloe Grace Moretz) in violent and profane situations.  This debate has been going on since "The Exorcist" and "Taxi Driver" in the Seventies and this argument will go on forever.  Regardless, I love this movie because it gives a jump start to a moribund genre, the comic book movie.  Director Matthew Vaughan has concocted something fresh, funny, original, and action packed.  Aaron Johnson is fine as Dave/Kick-Ass but everyone knows this is Moretz's vehicle.  Whenever she's on screen the energy level of the film rises appreciably.  Moretz's work here suggests a young Jodie Foster in the aforementioned "Taxi Driver".  Christopher Mintz-Plasse's star continues to rise after his memorable turn as McLovin in "Superbad".  If memory serves the film did OK but not great box office.  A sequel is alluded to at the end of the film so I hope "KIck-Ass" developes enough of a cult following so that comes to fruition.</p></body></html>

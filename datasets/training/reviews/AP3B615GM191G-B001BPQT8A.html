<meta name="summary" content="Could Have Beaten "Saw" To The Punch"></head><body><p>In 2004, the movie "Saw" vaulted to the top of many "psychological thriller" lists via its gritty depiction of violence and insights into the criminal mind.  Nearly ten years earlier, "Se7en" covered similar material and, barring one slip-up, could have stolen Saw's thunder.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Se7en" focuses on a series of brutal crimes revolving around the seven deadly sins of religious lore.  Investigators Mills (Brad Pitt) & Somerset (Morgan Freeman) are assigned to the case, each bringing a unique perspective (in keeping with their general film personas) to the strange murders.  As they near the end of the case, the detectives discover that the man they are pursuing has ideas about human nature that, while sadistic, might just cut to the core of what makes us all fallible.<br /><br />There are two reasons why this movie works as well as it does...<br /><br />First, the overall storyline is just very well-crafted.  Director David Fincher has proven time and time again that he knows how to construct a solid motion picture, and this one is no different.  By the end of the movie, you'll be questioning your very beliefs on what you just saw, making this a very cerebral experience.<br /><br />Also, Fincher does not shy away from portraying the re-enactments of the seven deadly sins in their graphic detail.  Some people would probably view this as overkill or gross-out film-making, but Fincher realized that it HAD to be this way for such a dark, gritty film to work.<br /><br />In terms of acting, Pitt & Freeman turn in their usual solid performances.  The character arcs seemed a bit forced (Pitt as the "eager rookie", Freeman as the "grizzled vet"), but the physical acting itself (as well as the way it all comes together in the end) more than makes up for that.<br /><br />The only reason I can't give this film a full five stars (and also the same reason why I can't say it is as good as Saw)?  To me, the real "meat" of the story is when the two detectives finally confront the villain (played to perfection by Kevin Spacey).  Whereas in Saw, the "Jigsaw" killer is given as much backstory & screen time as the protagonists, "Se7en" only focuses on Spacey's character for the last portion of the film.  Everything leading up the that is a procedural cop story (albeit a graphic & disturbing one).<br /><br />Thus, I consider "Se7en" to be a groundbreaking effort in the psychological thriller department, paving the way for later efforts like "Saw".  It isn't perfect, but it did (at least at the time) tread new ground.  Unless you are overly squeamish, this movie will keep you engaged from its shocking beginning to its even more shocking finale!</p></body></html>

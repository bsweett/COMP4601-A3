The truth is . . . I was never a reasonable man."<br />-Young Edward Bloom<p>Tim Burton's "Big Fish" proves the truism that memory can never be totally accurate or complete.  Making matters worse is that sometimes the person recalling the past will embellish his or her memories to the point where fiction and fact become inseparable.  Yet, is this necessarily a bad thing?  Who amongst us after all has not been amused by the occasional tall tale?<p>Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is and has always been a master storyteller.  His son, Will (Billy Crudup) has heard all of the tales of his father's youth many times over while growing up.  He loved listening to them when he was a small boy but became annoyed by them as he grew older and began to recognize them for what they really were - tall tales.  When Edward falls ill, Will returns home and asks his father if he would finally come clean and tell him the truth about his life.  Will is desperate to find out who his real father is since surely he was not the man who during his youth had adventures with a legendary catfish, a witch with a glass eye, a giant, a circus run by an unusual ringmaster, a mermaid, and two Asian singers joined at the hip?  Or was he?  <p>At first glance it might appear that "Big Fish" is a whimsical story about a man who lived a fascinating life in his own mind.  However, a closer inspection reveals it to be a much more deeply layered film than that.  On an individualistic external level, it explores the notion of legacy by examining one man's desire to make himself seem more fascinating than he really was.  And on an individualistic internal level, it explores the psychological importance of utilizing the imagination to alleviate the personal disappointment felt when one's life does not turn out to be as colorful as had been hoped.  Yet, despite the profound themes circulating throughout "Big Fish," the film never feels too heavy-handed as Burton skillfully includes just the right amount of amusing moments from start to finish to keep you smiling.  Much credit must also go to the amazing group of actors and actresses in the film.  There is not a single miscast performer as Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonham-Carter, Danny DeVito, Matthew McGrory, Robert Guillaume, Steve Buscemi, Ada Tai, and Arlene Tai are all great in their respective roles.  Ewan McGregor deserves special recognition for his portrayal of the young Edward Bloom as he is totally convincing in every scene he appears in no matter how outlandish the surrounding circumstances may be.  Kudos to Burton for making amends for his disappointing re-imagining of "Planet of the Apes" (2001) with this film.  Here's hoping that "Big Fish" is the start of another creative winning streak for him.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tragic and uplifting"></head><body><p>I'm not an Oliver Stone fan, but I have to give him credit for this film. The terrorist attack on 9/11 is the background, but this story transcends that and becomes a universal story of large-scale tragedy and individual courage and survival. There is nothing gratuitous or overdone in this film, and it somehow manages to be both sensitive and direct.<br /><br />However, there is one point I am confused about, and perhaps another reviewer can clear it up. When the first tower collapses and the port authority police team are trapped under the rubble, there is a roll call. It seems to me that four or five men call out their names, but shortly after we only see three men, with no clue as to what happened to the others, and the story continues from there.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Road to redemption"></head><body><p>In his selection of good men's roles, Tom Hanks has being able to personify men with integrity, decency and impeccable moral. It's incredible that he still can continue transmitting those qualities while assuming the role of an assassin in Road to Perdition.<br /><br />According to the dictionary, perdition is hell, the loss of the soul, the eternal condemnation. But this movie is more about the fight not to lose oneself in that way. More specifically, it is about a father who0s in the road to perdition and wishes his son never has to cross it.<br /><br />A father and a son united by tragedy embark in a violent trip through America in the winter of 1931. Before the trip, both men practically didn't know each other. 12 year old Michael Sullivan Jr., and its brother Peter little know about their father Michael and his work as an assassin for the local Mafia head, John Rooney (Paul Newman). This man, whose power is compared with God's, has served like a paternal figure for the Sullivan family. His son Connor has felt always envy of the relation between his father and Michael; and these feelings bring violence after Michael Jr. witnesses a crime perpetrated by his father and Connor, an event that makes Connor decide to kill Michael's wife and their sons.<br /><br />Fearing for his life and thirsty of revenge, Michael flees with his surviving son. Their 6-week odyssey allows them to develop the intimate relation they never had before, a relationship that makes Michael think that he doesn't want his son to follow his steps.<br /><br />From the beginning, we know this will be a tragic history. Deliberately slow, Road to Perdition constructs the foundations of its outcome, one that's not arranged with Hollywood conventions but one that feels correct and appropriate, given the erroneous lives of the characters.<br /><br />Each element of Road to Perdition reflects a unified vision and meticulous attention in the details, from the wardrobe, props, to the magnificent cinematography and artistic direction which try to relive the Depression era in the United States.<br /><br />As Sullivan, Tom Hanks interprets his closest version of a villain. His humanity, demonstrated in the relation with his son, smoothes the character to such points that sometimes we forget he is a ruthless assassin. Paul Newman is more than magnificent like Rooney, a man able to feel an immense love by Sullivan, but not sufficiently strong as the familiar bonds. Jude Law gives a macabre touch to Maguire, the contracted assassin to kill Sullivan, whose hobby is take photos from his victims and sell them.<br /><br />All the crew, from the producer to the director, Sam Mendes, wants to make clear that this is a history of parents and children, crimes and punishments, errors and amendments. Nevertheless, Road to Perdition is very cold and distant, unable to involve us with the destiny of their characters. All the pieces fit with too much perfection. Each scene is coldly calculated, each phrase, each silence. It's a film that could have involve us more in the emotional plane, but their creators seem to have resigned to do so when they reached half of the road.</p></body></html>

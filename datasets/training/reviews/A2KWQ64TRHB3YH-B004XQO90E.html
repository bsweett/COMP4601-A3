<meta name="summary" content="This is an unusually good sci-fi mystery"></head><body><p>This is a very good film with a sci-fi story with an unusual plot and good acting. It raises many issues such as should we be able to experiment on humans when to do so would help mankind, what is time, can we change the past, how can we affect the future, can we hide information from the family of dead soldiers, and what is heroism. Viewers are pulled into the drama wandering what is going on, just as the hero of the film wonders. He is told some things, but not everything, but he figures it out. The film has a good surprise ending.</p></body></html>

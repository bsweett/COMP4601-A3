<meta name="summary" content="Death stalks fresh teenages on the Highway to Hell"></head><body><p>As a horror film sequel, one of the great graveyards in the realm of cinema, &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; holds up pretty well.  Of course when you basis of comparison are to revisionist films like &quot;Halloween 2&quot; and &quot;Friday the 13th Part 2&quot; along with films that have no conception of what worked in the original like &quot;The Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; and &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge,&quot; the bar is set pretty low.  The sequel to &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; had a good idea, but botched what to do with it.  The makers of &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; had enough sense to take what worked in the original and give it a slight twist.<p>On the first anniversary of Flight 180 there is the most horrible chain of highway accidents in the history of movies.  Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) is the last to die and then suddenly realizes it was all an instantaneous premonition.  Like the hero of the first film she is able to find confirmation that she has a glimpse of what is about to happen within arm's reach.  She takes direct action to spare the lives she had just seen lost and round two of this particular dance with death is underway.  <p>On the one hand all you really need to know is that if you liked the original &quot;Final Destination&quot; you will not be grossly disappointed by the sequel.  Once again you have Death coming after the people on his list by channeling the spirit of Rube Goldberg.  This sequel plays with its audience by constantly making you think you know exactly how the next victim is going to kick the bucket and then pulling a last second switch.  The other difference of substance has to do with the relationship between this final and the original, which turns out to be something more than the return of Clear Rivers (Ali Larter).  However, the biggest difference is that this time around the characters are hip to the constant foreshadowing that presages each gruesome demise (Death is apparently a frustrated movie director).  <p>You could say this is going too far in changing the rules of the game and off the top of my head I do not remember if there was as much foreshadowing as in the original.  A return visit to the creepy guy at the morgue reveals a new bit of information that comes under the &quot;Something I would have liked to have known earlier&quot; (like in the first film) category.  But if the alternative is rehashing the original film with a new set of exercises in creative killing, then these new wrinkles are acceptable twists.  &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; is not as much fun as the original, which is par for the course, but it is not an insult to the audience that liked the first film either.  You also have all the fun Infinifilm options on the DVD so that you can understand the meaning of every name in the film (e.g., Kimberly CORMAN as in Roger Corman, director of "Dementia 13" and other classic cheapo exploitation splatter flicks).  <p>Final Note: &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; meets my definition of gratuitous nudity, which is when the half-naked person is not one of the main characters but somebody who shows up just to provide the nudity (compare this with &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot; as an example of non-gratuitous flashing).</p></body></html>

Here the actors work overtime to embody the ultra-romantic lovers Ian McEwan created in his novel, but the one is so painfully thin, and the other so oddly short, that actually I didn't even think the army would take him, even if they were so desperate they were recruiting convicts during the dark days preceding Dunkirk.<br /><br />Knightley and McAvoy are otherwise perfectly convincing and oh, how I wanted them to have a happy life together!  Compounding what you might call "identification" problems in the movie is the way the director has used three different actresses to play the part of Briony Tallis.  The young girl is very good, but it's the grown up girl who's the best, Romola Garai, here outshining everything else she's done on the screen.  None other than Vanessa Redgrave plays Briony as an elderly woman, now a world famous novelist on the order of Iris Murdoch--Redgrave is a good ten years too young to play her convincingly, as the real life character would be really, really, really old, while Redgrave looks ready to play Renee Richards all over again.  She sort of called in the part, oddly enough, and maybe a relief after the anguish all the other actors have to express.  It is Redgrave who has to put over the big post modern twist in the story, and whether or not that falls flat depends on how much you believe her slightly wry delivery.  Her explanation for her character's actions may leave you walking away thinking, did she really expect us to believe her?<br /><br />We were in a crowded theater when James McAvoy is typing the incriminating letter that gets him into so much trouble, one letter at a time, type, type, type, each character filling the screen, and a little boy in the audience asks his mother, what does that word spell Mama?  Everyone laughed and I didn't hear what the mother told her son.  It was just awful, why take your toddlers to a movie called "Atonement"?  Or maybe you should take them out when the lovers onscreen start typing out four letter words in the late nineteen thirties.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Schlock"></head><body><p>Hannibal Lector is one of the most fascinating and enigmatic villians in modern cinema. Well, at least he was ... until this schlocky, cheesy and embarrassing film came along.<br /><br />"Hannibal Rising" creates a proposterous backstory of Hannibal Lector as a traumatized child whose sister is cannibalized by soldiers, and then ends up the adopted son/lover of his uncle's Japanese wife. Gaspard Ulliel, with a phony dead look in his eye and his hair hanging in his face, looks like he could have been plucked from any high school drama club. Whoever thought he was ready to fill the shoes of Sir Anthony Hopkins was clearly off their meds.<br /><br />"Hannibal Rising" is easily the worst film I've seen since "Basic Instinct 2".</p></body></html>

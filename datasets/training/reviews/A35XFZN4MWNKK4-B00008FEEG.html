<meta name="summary" content="A TRUE CLASSIC AND AN ALL TIME GREAT!"></head><body><p>Steven Speilberg takes the utterley commonplace story of a lonley child befriending an alien from outer space. Despite the theme being somewhat  tried and tested several times before this does emerge as a unique and  absolutley fantastic fantasy movie with still very stunning visual effects  and wonderful performances. Alongside, THE WIZARD OF OZ, this possibly has  to be the greatest child fantasy film of all time!  Its blend of humour  and sometimes highly emotional scenes add to the greatness of this film and  the ending is sure to get a lump in even adults throats. An excellent  classic!</p></body></html>

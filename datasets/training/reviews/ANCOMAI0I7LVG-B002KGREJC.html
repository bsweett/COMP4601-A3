<meta name="summary" content="There's no denying this film has charm..."></head><body><p>`Juno' at times comes off a little `too' abrasive.  Diablo Cody's script, which has been lauded as new-age perfection, can in moments come across forced and just a little `too' eccentric.  You may find yourself wondering if anyone really talks like this.  That said; the movie is so genuinely sweet and movie that it's easily forgivable.  In fact it's not a bad script; it's funny, witty and fresh, completely original; it's just a little `too much' at times.  That is the one and only complaint I have with this movie.  There is nothing else within this film that warrants another bad word from me.  The performances are sincere and touching, the plot is brilliantly constructed and the overall feeling of emotional connection I had in the close of this film was unexpected but joyously welcomed.  `Juno' is a great film.<br /><br />Here's why.<br /><br />The biggest plus this movie has it its fantastic cast who all commit wholeheartedly to the task at hand.  Everyone in this film is on point and that is not just a huge feat but a critical steeple for the films success.  When you think about the `witty' script filled to the brim with teenage lingo for the next generation it's some tough dialog to spurt and make believable.  The actors had a hefty assignment set before them.  If they didn't slip into character perfectly and fluently deliver their lines the film would have been a total loss.  It would have been choppy and awkward and a complete mess.  Delivering those lines fluently on the other hand would have taken a lot of work; and work they must have because not one actor failed to be convincing.  Everyone, and I stress the word `everyone', delivered magnificently.  It's the only way the script would have worked.<br /><br />The story follows young Juno MacGuff, a young teenage girl who finds out that she is pregnant (all thanks to that wonderful, blessed chair).  She decides against abortion and for adoption and so she searches to find the perfect family for her little sea monkey.  Those perfect parents wind up being Mark and Vanessa Loring.  It's apparent to the viewer that their relationship is not so perfect, but that's beside the point.  Juno thus decides that there is no other couple she would rather raise her baby and so with everything settled we now must wait, as do they, for the baby to come.  Waiting alongside Juno are her father Mac, her step-mother Bren and her baby-daddy Paulie.<br /><br />`Juno' is not your typical teen comedy for it actually delves deep into the workings of the characters it presents and helps us get inside their heads, know them and become a part of their story.  Juno is more than just another pregnant teenager to us.  Thanks to Ellen Page's Oscar nominated performance (so happy for her) Juno becomes a real person, with problems and issues and frustrations just like the rest of us.  Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are both fantastic as Vanessa and Mark, especially Garner who adds layers to her character, layers I didn't know Garner could deliver.  Michael Cera is just blowing up this year, and here as Paulie Bleeker he manages to make geek sheik.  J.K. Simmons is great as Mac and Allison Janney is flawless as Bren, utterly flawless.<br /><br />Like I said, there are times when `Juno' seems like it may be trying too hard but it's such a sentimental and sweet film that by the time the credits begin to roll you'll have forgiven it its minor trespasses and embraced it for the critical darling it's already become.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Outlandish laughs."></head><body><p>Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is a 1970's chauvinist anchorman. The old boy newsroom antics are on full display. Crude jokes and sexual overtones are the norm.<br /><br />When Ron Burgundy misses his anchor time slot Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) is thrust into action. She is the first female anchor to see the airway. Ratings go through the roof. Ron is let go. What will he do?<br /><br />This uncut DVD is sometimes over the top excessive language. This movie is vintage Will Ferrell. The script could be more polished. The writing tries to squeeze to many jokes into conversations.  The movie does not flow well. Will Ferrell can improvise with the best of them (SNL), but sometimes restraint works too. He is an enormous talent and will squeeze his way into the comedic hearts of America.<br /><br />"Old School" and "Elf" are destined to be Will Ferrell classics.<br /><br />Have you noticed! In Hollywood circles, if you are the lead, hot actor, bring in your actor friends for some cameos. If you follow Adam Sandler's movies you know what I mean. Ride the pony!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Movie That Holds Nothing Back"></head><body><p>Hostage starts out great but what's even better is that it ended the same way. I think the film is getting rated bad because people who love Die Hard see Bruce Willis in this and start comparing the films. I know this from hearing people in the theatre actually saying the movie is ok but it's no Die Hard. The film to me is perfect from the story to the action, there's not too much action but it's just right. Even better there was the birth and death of a unsuspected and excellent villain in Ben Foster.<br /><br />It starts out with the usual, a hostage negotiator (Bruce Willis) fail to save the life of innocent people and then he retires but not totally because he moves on to lead a small town police department. Next you are introduced to your nut cases Ben Foster (Mars) and Jonathan Tucker (Dennis) and his brother. Both Mars are and Dennis mad at the world because they have no money and feel like outcasts. So they play the outlaw roles and steal some stuff but what Dennis doesn't know is his little friend Mars whom he just met not even 3 weeks ago is a blood-craving psycho that goes way beyond just being a thief.<br /><br />The two gain interest in a girl who has a rich father and decide to follow her family to their house but they didn't know her father is in business with some crazy guys that want something in the house the girl's father owes them. The film gets crazy because there isn't just one problem there's a bunch of them. Ben Foster was great because he develops his character into an amazing villain and it seemed like he couldn't be stopped. Willis goes to war to get what he wants and loves and fights to the very end. I thought it was a great movie not only to blow off some time but it's something you don't want to miss for the wild plot twists. Also this is a very violent movie so if you have a slightly weak stomach it may start to get to you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Mummy - Absolutely incredible entertainment!"></head><body><p>I'm not exactly sure one can put enough emphasis on how great and entertaining a movie "The Mummy" is.  Reflecting upon the many great action/adventure movies of the nineties brings me to the conclusion that this silver screen phenomenon must be listed among the top five to ten films of the nineties.  Of course this is evidenced by its overwhelming box office receipts and DVD sales.  The odd thing for me was that due to a heavy work schedule and limited time, I never even saw a trailer for this great movie and thus didn't afford myself the opportunity to see it in the theaters!  This oversight was of course corrected with its sequel, "The Mummy Returns."<p>The stars - Given Brendan Frasier's past films I never would've ever expected him to make such an outstanding action/adventure star as he is with his performance in this film.  It almost seems as if the role of swashbuckling adventurer Rick O'Connell was created for him and him alone.  Then there's the ever beautiful and gorgeous Rachel Weisz starring as "Evy" or Evelyn whose performance in this film is dead on perfect as the librarian/adventurer.  Arnold Vosloo performs perfectly in the role of the Mummy.<p>One might think that a film of this nature might fall short on plot while being heavy on the action; this is simply not the case with "The Mummy."  The film moves along fluidly with a great amount of attention centered on the plot and supported perfectly by the comedic moments and the seamless CGI provided by ILM, the masters of the CGI domain.<p>I don't normally comment on the director but in this case I feel almost compelled to state that director and author of the screenplay, Stephen Sommers "must" be commended for bringing this outstanding story to fruition for it is simply a brilliant piece of work.  In "The Mummy" he has most certainly created the latest and greatest big budget, heavy action film series that can easily be compared to the Indiana Jones films, using those as a benchmark.<p>The premise:<p>The film opens with a superb opening sequence some three thousand years ago as we're taken to ancient Egypt in the year 1290 B.C. and shown the circumstances of how the High Priest Imhotep ended up being the Mummy through his and Anck Su Namun's treachery against Pharaoh Seti.  After his treachery, he attempts to resurrect Anck Su Namun in Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, but the Pharaoh's guards catch him and he is mummified.<p>Scrolling forward to the year 1926 and we meet our erstwhile heroes who through their chance meeting are on an adventure to find Hamunaptra.  While the majority of the group is searching for hidden treasure, Evy is looking for more...  Unfortunately for them and fortunately for us, she finds more and what follows is as stated above, one of the best action/adventure movies of the nineties and probably the best of this type since the last Indiana Jones film.<p>I highly recommend this film for all its merits; it is a great film that is fun and extraordinarily enjoyable.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>Building A Better Mummy - This is an outstanding special highlighting what everybody involved in making the film wanted to do as far as not making a film fraught with many a clich&eacute;, harkening one back to the older films.<p>Feature Commentary<br />Visual and special effects formation<br />Egyptology 101<br />Deleted scenes<br />Theatrical trailers<br />Universal showcase</p></body></html>

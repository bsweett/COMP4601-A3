<meta name="summary" content="True fans of the original might be a little put off, but still pretty funny"></head><body><p>Acting---------------7 out of 10, Martin is perfect, Kline a little too reserved, Jean Reno bores<br /><br />Directing------------6 out of 10<br /><br />Location/Scenery-----7 out of 10, France and New York, can't miss there<br /><br />Comedy Rating--------8 out of 10, Lots of physical humour, more hits then misses<br /><br />Quality--------------7 out 0f 10, Minimal grain, bright colors, decent editing<br /><br />Violence------Light, mostly comical<br /><br />Blood/Gore----None<br /><br />Nudity--------Beyonce's cleavage, that's all<br /><br />Sex-----------None<br /><br />Language------Light, couple of hell's and damn's here and there<br /><br />Overall-------Whole family can enjoy<br /><br />Total Score----------35 out of 50<br /><br />  I don't think I'll buy it, but I did laugh quite a bit, it does get a bit silly and sophmoric at times. I think only true die-hard fans of the Pink Panther series need purchase it. Martin's gifts for physical comedy are on full display here, and the fun and twists he gives his accent are hilarious. You will literally have tears in your eyes during a scene which a speech coach tries to get him to say "I would like to buy a hamburger' Needless to say, he can't. Good family fun, Not great, but cute.</p></body></html>

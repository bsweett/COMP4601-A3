He likes his work and his life, which is uncomplicated by relationships or domestic demands.  On one stop-over, however, Ryan meets a female version of himself (Vera Farmiga) and sparks fly.<br /><br />The success of this movie must be due entirely to the charm of its leading man, because it is in no other way unusual or special.  Clooney is indeed quite likable playing a slick smooth-talker while Farmiga is good in an undemanding role, but neither perfromance was  worthy of an Oscar nomination in my opinion.  The plot is pleasant enough, but hardly memorable, so I don't understand all the hype about it.  It was just okay for me and I've already forgotten most of it.  3.5 stars.</p></body></html>

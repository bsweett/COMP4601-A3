As do my young children.  However, with so much suspense and complicated plots, they are better suited to pre-teen and young adults.<p>Being one of the very few adults who have not read a single Harry Potter book, I was certainly not prepared for such an onslaught of scary situations and monsters as this movie put forth. I usually can take a lot of mysterious scarriness without being bothered, but some of this was so gross I wondered how on earth the people watching the movie as I did could sit there and put their little children through that horror. And whether these children would have nightmares for weeks (perhaps months) to come.<p>Parts of this movie was enjoyable and entertaining. But I would never take my seven-yr. old grandson to see such violence.<br />The flying car was fun to watch, shades of Chitty Bang Bang and Stars Wars special effects crammed together.</p></body></html>

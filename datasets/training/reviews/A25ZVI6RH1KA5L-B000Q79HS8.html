<meta name="summary" content="They should have left him alone."></head><body><p>The one man army of Jason Bourne is back in The Bourne Supremacy (2004), and he's got a hankerin' to do what he does best, that being `bringing it on'...(I heard this phrase used by a professional wrestler on the television...am I unsure if I am using it right)...it's not like he didn't warn them (them being the secret intelligence agency he used to work for), mentioning in the previous film that if they didn't let him be, he'd bring the fight to them...and he does...directed by the relatively unknown Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday), the film stars Matt Damon (Rounders) reprising his role as Jason Bourne from 2002's The Bourne Identity, along with several other including Franka `homina, homina' Potente (Run Lola Run), Brian Cox (Troy), and Julia Stiles (Mona Lisa Smile).  Also appearing is Joan Allen (Pleasantville), Karl Urban (The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King), and Karel Roden, who appeared in the dreadful 2001 film 15 Minutes, starring Robert De Niro (need more proof that De Niro is certainly not exempt from bad films?  Go check out his recent, abysmal outing in Godsend...I had to go see Raging Bull after that one to reaffirm the fact that his is one of the greatest assets in Hollywood).<br /><br />The film begins with Jason (Damon) and Marie (Potente) residing `off the grid' (this term is used a few times...I thought it was kinda cool) somewhere in India.  Jason's having nightmares, enduring the side effects of his past assassin training, received during his tenure in the now defunct Treadstone project, which was basically a covert gooberment kill squad (all this is explained in the first film, so go see it).  He's still suffering from the fractal memory, but life is good...that is until an unfortunate event forces him to confront forces conspiring to use his existence for their own, nefarious means.  After one of CIA director Pamela Landry's (Allen) mission's gets messed up, she forces the Treadstone files opened (evidence indicates a former member is the one that screwed up her operation), and the hunt for Bourne is on...but Bourne is already on the move, looking to make good on his promise he made in the previous film (see my first paragraph).  The board is set, the pieces are in play, and all we have to do is sit back and enjoy the show...<br /><br />I found a lot to like about this film...I suppose because the makers tended to stick to the formula that made the first one work.  Tony Gilroy returns with a smart, fast paced screenplay (he also did the first film), but previous director Doug Liman does not, instead taking the executive producing credit, allowing for Paul Greengrass to helm this sequel, who manages maintain much of the flavor of the original, but not without a few problems.  My biggest complaint (one shared by a few people, I see) is the seemingly constant shaking of the camera, which I've now dubbed the Greengrass Syndrome.  I read that this was done on purpose, through the use of handheld cameras, to present a gritty feel, but, as with just about anything, too much can be a bad thing.  Seriously, I was wondering if the cameraman suffering the delirium tremors, figuring he was a recovering alcoholic.  That aside, everything else worked.  I thought Damon did exceptionally well, and it now appears, within this burgeoning franchise, he is the archetypal Bourne character, much like Sean Connery and the Bond films.  Of course it didn't hurt being backed by a talented and experienced supporting cast featuring Cox and Allen.  The plot was fairly intricate, but if you stay with it, it will come clean in the end.  There's quite a bit going on, and it's not always put forth in a straightforward manner, but relayed in bits and pieces, requiring some effort (and patience) from the viewer.  I did think it a little odd that Bourne could elude his former agency as well as he did, seeing as how they were the ones who trained him, but then Allen's character within the film also brought up this point, creating a sense that the writer understood beforehand that some audience members would feel this, and gave us something to identify with in the movie (I am unsure if that will make sense, but my point is Gilroy is exceptional at his craft, having the ability to anticipate his audience, and allow for it within the story).  How much of Robert Ludlum's original story made it into the film?  I couldn't tell you, but I have read that, within the novel, much of the beginning took place with Bourne in a Indian prison (this wasn't the case in the film), but then after that the script and the original story align a bit more closely.  As far as the action goes, I wasn't wanting...I was impressed with the way the film was able to balance the elements of the story and maintain a high level of action, and my interest, throughout (this was also the case with the first film).  If you like car chase scenes, there's a real doozy in here, taking place in Moscow.  Was it as good as the one in the first film?  Pretty close (Bourne crashes a whole lot more), but the frenetic, trembling camera work detracted a little...alright, I won't mention the annoying camera work again, other than to ask Greengrass to accept the fact that one can create the desired level of tension and `grittiness' filming with a Steadicam by employing a series of quick cuts.<br /><br />The widescreen anamorphic picture (2.35:1) looks wonderful (the muted colors were the director's choice), and the sound is crystal clear.  The special features (a whole slew of them) are already listed on the Amazon, so I won't bother repeating them.  If you enjoyed this film, keep your eye out for the next one, The Bourne Ultimatum, slated for release 2007.<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></body></html>

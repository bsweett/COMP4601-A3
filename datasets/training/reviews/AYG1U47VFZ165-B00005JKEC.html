<meta name="summary" content="Is The Day Over Yet?"></head><body><p>One cannot certainly argue the merits of Denzel Washington's performance as the crooked but hard-hitting cop in TRAINING DAY.<p>One, however, can easily argue the merits of whether or not the performance deserved Academy Award recognition, and I would imagine that this will become an argument for the ages.<p>Is it truly noteworthy (or awardworthy) to grant one of cinema's most gift and rightfully revered African American actors the distinction of playing such a stereotypical role?  In all honesty, does Mr. Washington want to be remember more for THIS role than he would the perceptive Ezekial Rawlins in DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS ... or the brave submarine commander in CRIMSON TIDE ... or the military officer trying to find a personal sense of purpose in death in combat in COURAGE UNDER FIRE ... or the Civil Rights leader in MALCOLM X?<p>Granted, the AMPAS cannot undo history and go back to honor Denzel for roles that truly showed distinction, but we've seen the detective he played in TRAINING DAY in hundreds of other films, portrayed by hundreds of other gifted actors, in similar situations.  To award someone with the talent of Denzel Washington film's highest honor for such a stereotypical role is, perhaps, film history's greatest injustice.<p>That said, the plot -- while predictable -- unfolds as the young recruit (played by the always-forgettable Ethan Hawke) realizes he's being used, rises to the occasion, and saves the day.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Original and deeply moving"></head><body><p>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the weirdest movies that I've ever seen. It's also one of the most moving. The basic plot of the movie is this: A shy Joel (Carrey) meets the outgoing Clementine (Winslet), and the two fall in love. After a horrible fight/break up, Clementine undergoes a procedure that erases Joel from her memory. In the heat of anger, Joel himself signs up for a similar procedure. However, mid-way through the erasure, he changes his mind. The viewer is granted an opportunity to inhabit Joel's mind as he tries to hold on to the final shreds of his love with Clementine.<br /><br />The movie interestingly explores themes relating to love. When you really love someone, and the realtionship ends badly, you ARE tempted to wish the whole mess had never happened. This movie shows us what a tragedy it would be if our wishes were granted.<br /><br />I thought Jim Carrey did a fabulous job in this film; I don't think I've seen him turn in such a layered performance in anything else he's ever done. It's just such an original concept - the thought that you could erase people, places, things, from your memory. But if you erase things that bring you pain, you also erase some of the joy out of your life. And you erase part of who you are. If you erase your mistakes, you don't learn from them. And you don't grow stronger because of them.</p></body></html>

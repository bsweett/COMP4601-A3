<meta name="summary" content="One of the worst and painful sequels in recent memory-how sad!"></head><body><p>Transformers Two is one of the worst sequels in recent memory and remains as one of the worst pictures I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through.Spielberg,Bay and company should be ashamed of this overly complicated,long and generally shoddy product they hoisted on an eagerly awaiting public.The first movie in this franchise was superb;the right amount of action with a very credible plot and great special effects.This movie takes all that that was built on and essentially trashes it.<br />Shia Lebeouf returns as Sam,as his friend Optimus Prime continues his fight to eliminate the Decpeticon threat throughout the world(and in space).Sam discovers a piece of the Allspark in his house which melts through the floor to bring to life all the appliances in his house,wreaking alot of unwanted havoc.Optimus approaches Sam saying that the Decepticons are amassing again and the time has come that he needs his help.Sam,incredulously considering all that has past in the first movie,refuses to help!!He's off to college and can't be bothered??? Sam,in keeping with all that has gone on,should have been right there,no questions.This illogical plot thread creates a rift from which the movie never recovers.<br />Sam goes to college but the inevitable conflict follows him,much to his chagrin(what did he really expect?).In fact he does everything to avoid getting involved.His roommates we discover even run an internet alien conspiracy theory site;how convenient!The fight eventually engulfs Sam and his girlfriend who have no choice but to join Optimus and company in their fight against the Decepticons.Their journey goes worldwide and Megatron is(of course) released and in turn releases the Fallen,the evil head of the Decepticons.In the end it is a dual to the death and just as we think Optimus and Sam are no more a material called the Matrix comes into the picture and with the help of ancient Primes Sam is sent back to bring Optimus back to life to finally defeat the evil horde.<br />This is just a tip of the iceberg breakdown of the plot,because it is a long,ponderous and over complicated thing that I could never do justice to anyway;nor is it WORTH repeating or trying to do justice to(may I recommend a look at [...],to see just how complicated it really is).One autobot we are intro'd to is a souped up ice cream truck which turns into two "homeys" at will who constantly argue over nothing and are there for supposed "comic relief" but offer nothing but annoyance.<br />At 143 minutes this special effects driven leviathan slowly weaves its' way along and doesn't really get moving until the last 20 minutes or so,and by then everything is anti-climactic and you are just wishing the whole mess a speedy and quick ending.<br />This two DVD set contains featurettes,deleted and alternate scenes and a music video by Linkin Park.The film has been transferred beautifully and the sound as A-1.However it is like trying to dress up a corpse;there is no life here so why bother.<br />This movie goes on my all time Turkey list for two reasons:what the film IS and for what it SHOULD have been.Unless the next one can dig itself out from under this massive failure somehow,this might have essentially killed the franchise in just two pictures.The producers lost sight of the ball big time and the proof is painfully here for all to see.But I recommend you save your money and DON'T!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Funny and Touching Culture/Language Clash Dramedy."></head><body><p>Spanglish is a film that would be more enjoyable for viewers who have learned to speak a second language or have moved from one country to another, because most of the funny moments are generated from culture clash and language barriers. This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie, and he's doing good taste humours here like he did in Punch Drunk Love. The cast is superb in this film, especially Paz Vega(Sex and Lucia) who managed to deliver a wonderful, funny, and dramatic performance as a overly protective single mother(Flor Moreno) working as a housekeeper for the Clasky family.<br /><br />Tea Leoni is very impressive as the comic relief most of the time. She plays Deborah Clasky, a fulltime mom and she's obsessed with exercise and when she became discontended with her husband John(Sandler), she started to cheat on him. She's quite a neurotic case, and only her mother(Evelyn) can fully understand her and gives her good advice. Evelyn is a witty ex-jazz singer and an alcoholic, and she was wild and promiscuous in her younger days. John is a workaholic/renowned chef and restraurant owner. He is trying his best to be a good dad and husband. His daughter is overweight and very self-consious about it, and she befriends with Flor's daughter Cristina(played perfectly by the bilingual Shelbie Bruce) who served as a translator for her mother most of the time. The several months of working for the Clarsky, Flor's life and her relationship with her daughter had reached a volatile state. She feared changes and she resented her daughter for becoming so Americanized.<br /><br />This film is funnier in the first hour, and then it headed a melodramatic direction that intended to build up a touching and meaningful ending. Some of the deleted scenes will provide some clarity on certain "unfinished" scenes. The special feature also included some brief interviews on the leads. I was surprised that Paz Vega didn't speak any English before starring in this movie. Her character actually learned to speak English later in the film, but it's exaggeratted that she could learn so much over the course of one summer.</p></body></html>

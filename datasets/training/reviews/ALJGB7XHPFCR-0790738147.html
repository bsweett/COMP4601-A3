The characters in this film are shown as they are - the good, the bad, and the ugly about each is right there on the screen for all to see. The acting is exceptional all around. Watching Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pierce (playing cops as different as you can imagine) each pursue the same case in their own ways is captivating entertainment. Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito and James Cromwell also turn in notable performances. I saw this in the theater when it first came out and I have seen it several times since then on DVD. It only gets better with each subsequent viewing. Note: If you love a move with great music, then you are in for a treat with this one. The soundtrack is good enough to listen to without the movie.</p></body></html>

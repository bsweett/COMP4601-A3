<meta name="summary" content="Dumb movie. Tommy Lee Jones mumbles. Psycho killer gets away"></head><body><p>Okay, so I don't understand the Coen brothers crap that they give to Hollywood. I still don't see why Tommy Lee Jones was even cast in this movie. Yeah, yeah....old men, times change, people change; and all that rubbish.<br /><br />The story was really about Josh Brolin (Llewelyn) who stumbles upon an a large amount of cash from an aborted drug deal gone bad between a bunch of dealers and buyers (everyone's dead on the scene, except one guy in a truck - he's later killed. But not by Brolin). And the Psycho killer, Anton (Javier Bardem) who goes around capping off people shooting bolts into their foreheads, or blowing them away with a suppressed shotgun (right) in his attempts to recover the cash that Llewelyn has taken. Anton acts like sort of an automaton throughout the movie. Sometimes flipping a coin to see if he'll take the life of his next victim (the victim is supposed to "call it". Uh-boy.<br /><br />Leewelyn's girlfriend, Carla Jean (played by Kelly MacDonald) was a really annoying stereotype of "trailer trash," with a double-digit I.Q. to boot. Seemingly spaced-out and unable to do any thinking on her own. Or maybe it was because she was so used to taking orders from Llewelyn (who cares).<br /><br />Woody Harrelson plays a short part (that's right, he gets blown away by Anton) hunting Anton and trying to get the money back from Llewelyn without really wanting to kill him.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones goes about the movie blabbering lines and contemplating this and that....oh my gosh, you really have to be into this existential garbage that the actors are attempting to convey to the audience. I got it - it was just plain stupid.<br /><br />The killer gets away in the next to the last scene. And then we see good 'ol Ed Tom who blathering to his wife about a dream. Oh, help me. I can see why it grossed ONLY $74 mil. With the exception of the shootout between Anton and Llewelyn - Bad movie. Lousy Movie.</p></body></html>

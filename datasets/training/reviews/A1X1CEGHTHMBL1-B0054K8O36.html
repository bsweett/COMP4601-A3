<meta name="summary" content="OK, but not the best Pirates of the Caribbean movie of the series!"></head><body><p>Fishermen pull a body from the sea and it comes alive.  They take him to the king of Spain and the man talks of the Fountain of Youth and Ponce De Leon.  Meanwhile Captain Jack Sparrow is on trial and he escapes and is captured again and taken to the king of England who wants to know the secrets and location of the Fountain of Youth. At the same time, an imposter Jack Sparrow is recruiting for a crew to go look for the Fountain of Youth but the real captain is Blackbeard and his daughter.  So now we have three competing groups of people searching for and seeking the benefits of the same prize.<br /><br />While this movie had some good spots and lots of action I actually found it boring at times.  Too many scenes were just dark and foggy and walking through the forest or swamp at night.  I also found the dialog to be too overdone and frankly not interesting.  The action scenes were great but they were separated with dull script and dark scenes.  Only Captain Jack Sparrow is the star in this movie and Penelope Cruz as Angelica just didn't do a great job.  Geoffrey Rush playing Captain Hector Barbossa was the pirate leading the English expedition in this movie and his role was fairly good as well as Ian McShane who played Blackbeard.<br /><br />Over all the movie was Jack escapes, Jack is captured, Jack changes teams, Jack escapes, Jack is captured, Jack changes teams, over and over and over!  For the limited plot the movie just seemed too long.  I would rate this 5 stars as the special effects were good and Jack's escape scenes were funny but this edition of the movie series just doesn't expand the characters and the story was to repetitious of the first three movies.  This movie needed one other super character to stand out and it did not happen for me and the script should have stayed livelier.  It sadly drops to 3 stars because of its shortcomings!</p></body></html>

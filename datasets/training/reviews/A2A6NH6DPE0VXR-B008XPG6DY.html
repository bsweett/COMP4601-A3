<meta name="summary" content="A Decent Little Thriller"></head><body><p>Clive Owen stars as a family man who gets his life turnt upside down when he meets a business-women (Jennifer Aniston) on the train. They decide to get together eventhough they both have families. Before they can have sex, a man (Vincent Cassel) busts in the motel room, robs them and rapes her. Things don't end there though because the man starts calling Owen and making threats to tell his wife on him unless he gets more money. After Owen gives him some, he calls wanting more and more and Owen has to figure out how to get him out of his life.<br /><br />  The trailers make it look like the movie is all about Owen and Aniston trying to get this bad man out of their lives but this is mostly Owen's movie and Cassel's. Vincent Cassel is great as the kind of  slimy villian you love to hate.  Aniston is basically just a side-character that doesn't have that much to do. Owen is excellent but the material isn't really worthy of his ability.</p></body></html>

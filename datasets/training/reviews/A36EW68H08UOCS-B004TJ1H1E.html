Ms. Monroe and Mr. Curtis share a scene on a yacht that is both funny and guaranteed to raise the pulse of any heterosexual man with a heartbeat.  Tony Curtis also does a great Cary Grant impersonation when he is trying to woo Ms. Monroe, and not wearing drag to avoid the Chicago gangsters that have tracked them to Miami.  The story is absolutely ridiculous, but the cast runs with it with so much gusto that you can set aside any thoughts about how realistic the story seems to just enjoy the witty dialogue and the hilarious situations that these memorable and likable characters find themselves in.  Only recommended for those who'd like a good laugh!</p></body></html>

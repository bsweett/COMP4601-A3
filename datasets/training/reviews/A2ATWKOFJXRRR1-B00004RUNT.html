<meta name="summary" content="Sci Fi Laughs!"></head><body><p>Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) is a retired Space Marine who's chosen the sedentary field of cab driver as his post-military lifestyle.  The trouble is, is that the military needs him.  Again.  <p>Zork (Gary Oldman) wants darkness and evil to take over the Earth . . . and he's helping it out.  And Evil/Darkness has a form; it's a big ball of energy speeding on a collison course toward Earth after millenia wandering the galaxies and looking for the Fifth Element: the only thing that can destroy Evil.  <p>Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) is a resurrected woman found in a destroyed transport ship (she's reconstructed on Earth after they find only a piece of an arm left).  But something is odd about this woman.  She's got superhuman strength, speaks the 'divine' language, and can kick some bad-boy butt!  <p>Ruby Rock (Chris Tucker) is a DJ with some serious attitude.  He's rich, women fawn over him . . . he's the equivalant of a futuristic Wolfman Jack, only with less facial hair.<p>Come to find out, Leeloo IS the Fifth Element and she's the only one who can stop Evil.  But can she?  Or WILL she?  With the help of a washed up Marine (Willis) and a panzy-boy DJ (Tucker) she's got a pretty good shot at it, wouldn't you say?  <p>This SF flick has it all: action, romance, laugh-out-loud antics, and futuristic perspectives.  A very, very, very fun film to watch.  I've seen it at least six times and it always makes me laugh.  Tucker and Willis work like comedic geniuses together whenever they're in the same scene.  <p>A++++ funny film!</p></body></html>

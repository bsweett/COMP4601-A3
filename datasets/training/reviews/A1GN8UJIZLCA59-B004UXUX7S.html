Much like its predecessor, The Descendants deftly mixes pain and humor with snappy script that won Mr. Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash a best adapted screenplay Oscar.  George Clooney stars as Matt King who is a real estate lawyer in Honolulu and a direct descendant of Hawaiian royalty.  He is the trustee of a family trust that owns 25,000 acres of pristine land on the island of Kauai that his family is looking to sell before the trust expires.  While this is happening, his wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) is left in a coma after a boating accident.  He refers to himself as the back-up parent to his two daughters, Scottie (Amara Miller) and Alex (Shailene Woodley).  He now has to step up as a full-time father. After taking Alex home from her private school, she tells him that Elizabeth was having an affair.  This sends Matt's world spiraling even more out of control.  The rest of film deals with Matt trying to find his wife's lover and the selling of the land.  Mr. Clooney shows his versatility as an actor playing Matt as a beaten down man trying to rise to the occasion.  He received a well deserved best actor nomination.  Ms. Woodley is a real find.  She could have played the part as much more of a caricature of a screwed up teen, but she adds real depth to the role.  The scenery as one would expect is gorgeous and the pacing of the film is just right. Let's hope Mr. Payne waits less than seven years before he make another picture.</p></body></html>

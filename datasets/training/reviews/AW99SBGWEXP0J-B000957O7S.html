<meta name="summary" content="Hitch"></head><body><p>Alex "Hitch" Hitchens (Smith) is the date doctor.  Having problems getting the girl you want?  Call Hitch.  He will show you just what you need to do to win her over, and tell you what mistakes to avoid.  He knows all this from observation.  He has seen what works, and wants to share his knowledge.  On the down side, his own love life is sorely lacking.  Enter Sara, a gossip writer who catches Hitch's eye.  They go on a series of disasterous dates in which Hitch can do nothing right, but somehow a connection is made.  Of course, Sara is following a lead on the mythical date doctor, and you know that sooner or later, Hitch's secret will be revealed.<br /><br />Will Smith does a good job in his first romantic comedy, showing the screen presence that movie-goers have come to expect.  Kevin James steals almost every scene that he is in as the unlucky in love Albert.  They are the reasons that this movie works, and is very funny at times.  The story itself is predictable (as most romantic comedies are), but weaves a number of stories into an ending where everything comes together.  "Hitch" is a good date movie, and a funnier than average film.</p></body></html>

It has all the right elements: a high body count, good movie monsters, a good premise and lots of blood. Who wins? Well, if you have ever seen any of the Freddy or Jason movies, then you will know how it ends. This movie is a nice diversion, it is not cheap looking nor is it as brain-dead as most of the Friday 13th films.</p></body></html>

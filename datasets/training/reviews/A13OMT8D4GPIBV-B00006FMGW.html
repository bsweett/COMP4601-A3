<meta name="summary" content="A Fun Film From Steven Spielberg"></head><body><p>Another must see from director Steven Spielberg.  Leonard Di Caprio (in a year in which he first worked with Martin Scorsese also) stars as Frank Abagnale, a teenage con artist.<br /><br />This is a definite fun movie, light hearted, and well worth a watch.  I definitely recommend it if only for the awesome opening credits.  One of the best movies from Steven Spielberg, and most likely his second most fun (behind Raiders of the Lost Ark)<br /><br />The DVD features a number of featurettes and interviews.  It's a wonderful Two Disc set.<br /><br />A definite must see.</p></body></html>

If you ask Kubrick fans what their favorite Kubrick films are, you will get the almost universal answer of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Dr. Strangelove. I finally saw the former all the way through for the first time a couple of months ago, and it was just as bad as I figured it would be from the pieces I'd seen. Now, I've seen the latter, which I again assumed would be terrible based on what I'd seen of it; unlike 2001, though, in this case I'd actually underestimated how thoroughly horrible this movie is. (And, for the record, of the Kubrick movies I've seen-- I'm still missing a few-- my two favorites are, by far, The Killing and Lolita.)<br /><br />Critics back when it came out, of course, immediately compared it to Fail-Safe, the other 1964 film about the War Room. It was inevitable, really. The main difference between the two films is that Fail-Safe plays it straight and goes for tension, while Dr. Strangelove goes for satire. The biggest problem is that the satire just isn't funny. It's the same tired old antiwar message crap we've heard a million times before. There's no thought given to characters or plot at all; it all exists for the sole purpose of poking fun at anyone who's not a hard-line antiwar activist. (Reportedly, Peter George, upon whose novel the film is based, despised it-- probably for that reason.) There is no attempt at subtlety here, no attempt at artistry. There are many attempts at humor; all of them fail. Now, I grant you, they might actually be hilarious, but I couldn't tell; I was too busy reeling from getting hit in the head with the antiwar hammer over and over again.<br /><br />This is the big difference between the infinitely superior Fail-Safe and this pile of garbage; Fail-Safe actually hands the viewer a worthwhile story, characters for whom the viewer is capable of feeling sympathy/antipathy, plot development, the works. In other words, it's actually a movie rather than a collection of unfunny jokes around a theme. Dr. Strangelove is, in no uncertain terms, one of the worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of sitting all the way through. It may not be the worst, but it's certainly in the top five.

<meta name="summary" content="[3.5] A good film, but well below expectations."></head><body><p>This third incarnation of Richard Matheson's masterpiece is superior to its predecessors in every way, but in spite of that achievement the film is still lacking and comes across as a disappointment in too many ways.<br /><br />I can't bear to rehash the plot as nearly everyone knows this story by now, and if you are one of the few unfamiliar with this story, then please read Amazon's well-written synopsis or Trashcanman's excellent review in the Spotlight review section.  I just plan to hit what I enjoyed about this film and what was so disappointing.<br /><br />The Hits:<br /><br />(1) Another top-notch, winning performance by the ever reliable and likable Will Smith.<br />(2) Outstanding set designs combined with CGI effects of a desolate and abandoned New York City make this film seem more important than it is.<br />(3) Best adaptation of Matheson's highly influential novel (even if it isn't the most faithful to the story in a literal sense --it captures the spirit of his work extremely well).<br /><br />The Misses:<br /><br />(1) The most glaring problem with this film, in my view, is the CGI effects for the vampire-like survivors of the plague.  They are too cartoonish for me and appear far too much like video game villains.  A good example of this for me is the early scene where Smith's character enters a building to get his dog and finds some zombies hiding in a corner.  They are real people, not CGI, and they are frightening; however, later, when he's attacked by CGI zombies, it is unintentionally humorous as they appear like Gollum from LOTR on acid.  The CGI effects are either not believable or just too over-the-top, thus, the scenes with them lose their punch.<br /><br />(2) Uneven pacing of the story is a problem here.  The opening segments give the impression that we are going to see a masterpiece here, but the second half of the film never matches the first half and it feels very rushed.  It has that "hey, guys, we just ran out of money, so we have to wrap up this film up this week" feel to it.  In a film with a deliberate and nearly dignified opening to fall into a shoddy rushed finale severely hurts this film and leaves a bad taste in one's mouth.<br /><br />The film is still solid entertainment in spite of its obvious and significant flaws.  It is probably one I will even buy when it becomes available on DVD later, but it is rather disappointing for a film that seemed to have so much going for it.  Its box office receipts may reinforce that perception as it set opening weekend records with a take of about $77 million, but by its third weekend it only grossed about $15 million and that is a severe drop off.  For a film that reportedly cost $150 to make it has grossed a disappointing $228 after a month at the box-office.  That doesn't even qualify it has a hit with a mere $78 million dollar profit at this point.  I do think it will be a hit after it's been released world-wide.<br /><br />BTW:  Some may ask, "What is a hit by today's standards?"  That's a good question with really no one set answer, however, Hollywood traditionally likes to see a film generate double what it cost to make in order to classify a film as a hit.  This film with a cost of $150 million to make is expected to earn $300 million to be considered a hit, but certain stars, like Will Smith, are expected to bring in better than double the cost of the film (hence, why this may end up being considered a "disappointment" at the box-office even if it hits the magic $300M mark).</p></body></html>

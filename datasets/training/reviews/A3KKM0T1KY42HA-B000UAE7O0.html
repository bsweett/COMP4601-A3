It's certainly no 5-star classic, and it hardly borders on being 'great', but for a deliberately over-the-top, 70's Horror/gore-sploitation spoof, it easily takes the 2007 best-of cup.<br /><br />Have you ever seen that campy flick from the 80s called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KQNL8">Return of the Living Dead Part II</a>? You know, where some government bio-warfare chemicals are accidentally released and turn anyone that comes into contact with the agent into a brain-craving zombie? Well, Planet Terror Director Robert Rodriguez clearly has seen it, and he ultimately made what could be considered a *much* better than the original remake of ROTLD II with PT.<br /><br />Unlike its Grindhouse partner, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R7HY0K">Death Proof</a>, Planet Terror goes mainly with the 'that's just plain silly' instead of the 'this could really happen'. The situations in Planet Terror are over-exaggerated (deliberately); the gore is way over-done (deliberately); and the movie is as much a Comedy (deliberately) as it is a Horror film. Keeping the 'deliberateness' of the movie in mind makes it all work quite well.<br /><br />Planet Terror is full of actors you know, and many are usual suspects in the Tarantino/Rodriguez shop. The actors really help make this movie successful at what it's trying to do by taking their roles seriously in a not-so-serious movie.<br /><br />What exactly is Planet Terror trying to do? Entertain. It does so...thoroughly.</p></body></html>

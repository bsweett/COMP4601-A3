<meta name="summary" content="Amusing movie with a great performance by Brosnan"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan plays a thoroughly-enjoyable character (a gone-to-seed hitman with no ability to relate to people whatsoever whose analogies all reference prostitutes) the likes of whom I've never seen before in a film--the fact that the filmmakers surround him with an interesting cast and situations is just gravy.<br /><br />3/4</p></body></html>

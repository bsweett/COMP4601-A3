Abrams - Director / Writer / Producer presents us with a love story that incidentally is visited now and then by an alien.  Marketed as a sort of kids "Blaire Witch" story, the film is a pale reflection of "The Goonies" (1985.)<br /><br />Basically kids making a movie witness a train wreck and possibly something else. We know that they are in trouble as "poof" out of nowhere men in uniforms with flashlights appears.<br /><br />There is a disclaimer in the beginning of the film but there does seem to be a lot of gratuitous potty mouth in the presentation.<br /><br />Even if the plot was formula and many times formula can be fun, Elle Fanning excelled as a zombie. See her earlier works as Phoebe Lichten in "Phoebe in Wonderland" (2008).</p></body></html>

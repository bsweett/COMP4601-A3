This &quot;futuristic&quot; setting was extremely well done.  The story was great and aside from the original (the best), the climiax will leave you in awe.  The whole series rocks, even the new version (2001) You can't go wrong by owning all of these movies, and the Tv series on DVD. Go Ape!</p></body></html>

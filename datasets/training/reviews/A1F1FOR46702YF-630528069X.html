While visiting his family in LA, NYC police officer John McClanes (Willis) stumbles into a Christmas party on the top floor of a modern skyscraper. The party quickly turns deadly when a group of terrorists seizes control of the building. Now, using only his wits, McClane declares war on the terrorists who hold his wife hostage. "Die Hard" is certainly director John McTiernan's best work and ranks as one of the finest action movies ever made. This remarkable actioner contains some tight-paced camera work, a solid storyline, memorable dialogue and some good bits of humor. Bruce Willis delivers plenty of excitement and laughs, and Alan Rickman is positively engaging as the film's villain. The cast also includes Bonnie Bedelia, Paul Gleason, William Atherton and Reginald VelJohnson. "Die Hard" delivers some memorable thrills and spectacular action sequences including an impressive rooftop explosion.<br /><br />"Die Hard" Five Star Edition is a remarkable improvement over the previous release. This action-packed movie is presented in a THX approved, 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a stunning and rich video transfer that is cleaner and more enhanced than the previous edition. Its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is certainly outstanding but for the full home theater experience, the DTS audio track delivers more powerful bass and great clarity. This impressive DVD features in-depth audio commentaries with director John McTiernan and crew, fun outtakes, extended scenes, picture gallery, trailers and colrful interactive menus. With such a remarkable DVD presentation and worthy supplements, "Die Hard" Five Star Edition is the ultimate Die Hard experience and positively scores an "A".</p></body></html>

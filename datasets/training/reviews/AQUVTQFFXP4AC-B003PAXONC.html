<meta name="summary" content="Special Edition: Twice the price for about 5 minutes new footage?"></head><body><p>I absolutely loved the movie.  I believe it is Will Smith's best role since "Ali" and shows that he has some serious acting talent, as he holds his own in the first 2/3rds of the movie as the only screen presence for the film (minus flashbacks) opposite only a dog as his only companion and friend.<br /><br />I thought it was phenomenally shot, and genuinely the scariest movie I've ever seen in my adult life.  Nothing I'd seen until then was genuinely frightening (and not just a cheap teen horror thrill with a loud sound and/or violin shriek) when Sam (Neville's dog) rushes after a deer into a pitch dark area, with only a gun-mounted flashlight, and absolutely no music playing whatsoever.<br /><br />Followed by another genuinely frightening scene, in which Fred (one of the mannequins Neville sets up outside a video store to talk to) has been moved (as part of a Darkseeker's trap), and nearly drives Neville insane, thinking Fred is perhaps a real person, and having to shoot him to be sure, only to spring the trap.<br /><br />As great as the movie was, and as frightening as it was, and as heartbreaking as it was to see the fate of his family and his dog, I spend about 18 dollars for the special edition two-disc version.<br /><br />And I spend double the price for the single disc for... maybe five minutes extra footage, tops?<br /><br />Disc one is basically the same thing you'd get in the normal edition; movie plus four animated comics.  Disc two gives you THE SAME MOVIE with maybe five minutes additional footage, such as some minor deleted scenes setting up the premise for the Darkseeker's evolution and intelligence, and the alternate ending, which while was a bit frightening and touching at once, was hardly groundbreaking and not at all controversial.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert: The "alternate" version of the movie just has a butterfly reference (the Darkseeker girl's tattoo), a scene with Neville showing Anna and Ethan the trap the Darkseeker Alpha set for him, a scene with Ethan swimming in a fish pond while Anna asks about the Darkseeker's evolution, and the alternate ending, in which rather than sacrifice himself, Neville turns over the girl to the Darkseeker, who shows he can truly love, and the Darkseekers leave them be to escape, with a cure to the virus in hand.<br /><br />So for used on Amazon you get the single disc version for.. 8 dollars or so.  For used two-disc, you get for 14 (as of this date), and before that I paid 18 including shipping.<br /><br />So as with the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix special edition, I got screwed; we all got screwed.<br /><br />Worthless.  Try again next time, Warner Brothers.</p></body></html>

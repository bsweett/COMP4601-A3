<meta name="summary" content="I don't know, I think I'D like to visit Bruges"></head><body><p>Really interesting premise/set-up: You get a gorgeous travelogue on the truly picturesque European city of Bruges, which is the backdrop of a violent, profane gangster tale.  To further add to the theme of contrast, the film's most sensitive, likable character (played by Colin Farrell) has committed the most horrendous act in the film, and the most profane, brusque, and dangerous character- played by Ralph Fiennes in a third-act tour de force- actually has the most sensible outlook of everybody, as he attempts to undertake a type of justice for the Farrell character's undeniably appalling action. Brendon Gleeson is the most middle-of-the-road character here (a kind of stand-in for the audience, except that he's a hit man), and he attempts to work things out between everybody.<br /><br />Romance and edgy humor round out the mix, with everything bubbling along nicely and contributing to a film that's compelling and moving from beginning to end.  Just don't expect an it-all-works-out-for-everybody, hearts-and-flowers ending.  Of course, if you look at things in a kind of universal justice sort of way, maybe everything does work out the way it needed to.<br /><br />The DVD of "In Bruges" includes about an hour of extras, which give further details on both the travelogue and gritty crime aspects of the film.  Final thought: Colin Farrell is really good here, jumping between subtle, nuanced moments and comic rants about how "anyone could EVER want to visit the boring city of Bruges".  I liked him in Woody Allen's dark drama "Cassandra's Dream" and liked him even more here.  Party animal or not, this guy's the real deal.</p></body></html>

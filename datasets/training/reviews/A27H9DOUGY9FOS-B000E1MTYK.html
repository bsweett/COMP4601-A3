<meta name="summary" content="A Darker "Potter"--"Goblet" Fascinates Even A Non-Fan With Real Danger And Character Development"></head><body><p>As a viewer who is somewhat dispassionate about the "Harry Potter" franchise, I thought it might be interesting to weigh in on "Goblet of Fire."  As a point of reference, I have not read any of the novels--nor am I the target demographic for this type of film.  I have seen the other three entries in the series, and I have found elements in them that I have enjoyed.  But overall, while I see their appeal, they just haven't spoken to me as anything other than a pleasant diversion.<br /><br />That said, for the first time, "Harry Potter" captured and kept my attention.  This was the first picture (from start to finish) that I followed intently--and I found it a really enjoyable film.  Many people have summarized the plot much better than I ever could and many have done the book to film comparisons, so I offer a complete "outsider's" perspective for the casual viewer.<br /><br />I think what is starting to elevate the series for me is that the young actors are aging.  So in "Goblet" we're starting to see budding sexuality and romantic interests.  The series has always seemed a bit emotionless for my taste--more flash than substance.  So I am pleasantly surprised to see character development within the group of protagonists.  The story held my interest, I felt there were moments of real danger and intrigue--not just kids playing anymore, but life and death stakes.  There is a real resonance and emotion in this film, especially toward the end, as what transpires results in dire consequences.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, in particular, seem to be rising to the opportunity of having meatier and more developed roles.  Ralph Fiennes joins the cast as a believable villain--Voldemort, Brendan Gleeson is terrific as the morally ambiguous Mad-Eyed Moody, and Miranda Richardson is quite funny as an intrepid reporter.  Overall, the darker mood of this film suits a more serious interpretation and the PG-13 rating allows a harder edge.  A solid film, for me, this is a 4 star--and I actually look forward to the next film.  KGHarris, 11/06.</p></body></html>

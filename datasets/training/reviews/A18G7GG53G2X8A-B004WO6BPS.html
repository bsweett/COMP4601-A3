Rowling's novels into two films was a wise one, for it allows for the inclusion of crucial details that simply couldn't be cut for the sake of time and pacing. This first installment of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the most faithful adaptation since the original Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It's also just like all the previous films in that it's spectacular entertainment - provided you don't mind the shadowy, deeply emotional, almost funereal direction the stories have been going in. The depth of character is amazing, in all likelihood because of the film's overwhelming seriousness. The plot is engaging, a mixture of a road film, a scavenger hunt, and a revenge fable. It balances it's solemnity with a healthy dose of magic and, in a few very appropriate places, humor. It's also the first film in the series to end with a cliffhanger, always a welcome addition.<br /><br />Being faithful, of course, does have its drawbacks. The film is not only dependent on the viewer's knowledge of the previous installments, but also on the viewer's willingness to listen. Many, many important things are said by many, many people, and if you're not going to pay attention, you might as well see something else. Fortunately, just about everything is explained at one point or another; this is usually thanks to Hermione Granger, who after seven years is no less of a bookworm. We also have numerous scenes of the three leads piecing things together from little more than sheer speculation, and this is just as it has been since the very first film. What they will discover in Part 2 remains to be seen, but you can rest assured that some of what they thought about certain things will turn out to be incorrect.<br /><br />Part 1 begins exactly where Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince left off. With the magical world in chaos following the untimely death of Albus Dumbledore and a hostile takeover by Lord Volemort and his loathsome cronies, our heroes are forced to make drastic changes. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), now the most wanted wizard in the world, ships his aunt, uncle, and cousin off to a safe location. At Harry's side are his two best friends, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint). So too are members of the Order of the Phoenix, including Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), and even Hogwarts gamekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). It will be hard to keep Harry's location a secret from the snake-faced Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), since it seems he can easily be traced.<br /><br />A series of terrible events force Harry, Hermione, and Ron to go on the run; they magically transport themselves from one isolated location to another, taking refuge in a special tent that, like Dr. Who's telephone booth, holds more space than its outer dimensions suggest. Their mission: Seek and destroy magical objects called Horcruxes, all of which contain a small piece of Voldemort's soul. Harry thought he had found one at the end of the previous film, but that item - a locket - turned out to be a fake. Finding the real locket will involve an interrogation of a cranky house elf named Kreacher (voiced by Simon McBurney), the kidnapping of a shady wizard named Mundungus Fletcher (Andy Linden), and a carefully planned break-in into the Ministry of Magic, where, in disguise, our three friends will run into their old nemesis, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton).<br /><br />These and other events are carefully crafted, but they're also expected. Not so expected is the ways in which Harry, Hermione, and Ron are developed. The world as they knew it is gone - no more Quiddich games, no more visits to Hogsmeade, no more classes at Hogwarts. They've abandoned their former lives. In short, they've grown up. Yes, but why did they have grow up in this particular way? Why are Hermione and Ron following Harry when it's obvious he has nothing to go on apart from memories of vague conversations with Dumbledore? Was Dumbledore the great wizard Harry thought him to be, or were there chapters of his life he intentionally never revealed? Our three friends are lost, confused, and weary, stuck on a quest for objects that could literally be anywhere. These include the fabled Deathly Hallows, three magical items symbolized as a line within a circle within a triangle.<br /><br />The Harry Potter films have gone from wonderfully whimsical to delightfully dark to terribly tragic. We've marveled at their heroes, shuddered at their villains, and mourned at the loss of beloved figures. They've ignited our imaginations and beckoned us to follow along with them. Before, I've taken the approach of the giddy fanboy, brimming with excitement and anticipation. In the case of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, I take an approach of resignation and elegy. It's the beginning of the end. I always knew it was coming, but even after the passage of nine years - ten when Part 2 is released next summer - it still feels as if it's coming too soon. This new movie is wonderful, but I will always remember with longing the first time I saw three fresh-faced eleven year olds going on their first magical adventure.</p></body></html>

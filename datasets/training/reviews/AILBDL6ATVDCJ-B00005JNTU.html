<meta name="summary" content="Roger Ebert Is Wrong!  This Movie Is Great!  Non-STOP ACTION!"></head><body><p>I read the professional reviews by people like Roger Ebert.  I ignored their negative attacks and went to go see this film.  I am very glad I did.  I found this movie to have a little bit of everything and a whole lot of action.<br /><br />Let's start off with an explanation of why Ebert didn't like this film: Roger Ebert is an extreme LIBERAL and a politically correct junkie; unless a film has some "leftist message" or has a "leftist actor" in it, he probably is going to knock it.  This film is NOT politically correct, has no jokes bashing the current president, doesn't support abortion or euthanasia, and doesn't take a stand on gay rights.  Of course Ebert is going to hate the film!  Ebert has taken that whole "liberal arts" thing completely out of context.<br /><br />Oh, one more thing, had this film sprinkled the "F" word in every thirty or forty seconds, had some severe love scenes, and showed the cast helping little old bag ladies across the street in between real emergencies, Ebert would have put his useless thumbs up!<br /><br />I have read some reviews about how this was just a comic book made into a film. DUH!  That's exactly what it is, and exactly what I expected to see when I sat down with my garbage bag full of popcorn and gallon of Coca-Cola in a crowded theater.<br /><br />Fantastic 4 is an action-packed film with a lot of laughs and a lot of action.  Also, this film did a lot more to build up the audience's disdain for the bad guy, Victor Von Doom.  Spider-Man 2 failed to do that, and in my opinion, if a movie fails to make the audience want to see the bad guy get smashed then it's failed to do its job.<br /><br />On to the cast:<br /><br />Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards is a perfect fit.  He catches the personality perfect, and it was fun to watch him try and keep the other members of the Fantastic 4 inline.<br /><br /> Jessica Alba as Sue Storm worked for me.  Yeah, I've read the reviews here at Amazon.  I know she's a cutie and all that.  But I'm a happily married man, and besides, my wife might see this review.  So I'll just tell ya that I think she is the best Sue Storm ever!  Seriously, she can act, and I really enjoyed her work on screen with Ioan (does anyone even know how to pronounce that) and the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Chris Evans turns in his best performance to date as Johnny Storm.  He really made the film fun to watch.  Of course some of the credit has to go to Michael France and Mark Frost for writing such an excellent script / screenplay.<br /><br />Michael Chiklis is the perfect Ben Grimm.  My thirteen-year-old daughter was balling her eyes out when he was trying to pick up his wife's wedding ring on the bridge.  Never has any person so nailed a super-hero character the way Chiklis does in this film.  I used to read the Fantastic 4 comic books as a kid, and I would have never dreamed the Thing could have ever made it to the big screen in such a convincing manner.  Great job Chiklis!  I think you should put the suit back on and pay Roger Ebert a visit!<br /><br />Julian McMahon, I just want to let you know that I hated you from the opening scenes on!  You make me sick; exactly what a bad guy is supposed to do.  Great job as Victor Von Doom.  I hope there is a sequel.  I'd like to see if you could pull it off two times in a row.<br /><br />I liked everything about this movie: the writing, casting, special effects, music, and even the movie posters.  I think the professional movie critics who panned this movie need to find new careers.  Fantastic 4 rocks!  I will buy this DVD the second it is released.  No, I don't buy illegal DVDs, so yes, I do have to wait!<br /><br />Go see this film!  Buy this DVD!<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></body></html>

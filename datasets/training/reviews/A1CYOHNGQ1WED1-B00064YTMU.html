<meta name="summary" content="Stylish thriller"></head><body><p>This was a very good movie. It is stylish, which is a trademark of Michael Mann's, and has good performances by Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise. Foxx proves he can really act and Cruise makes a believable sociopath. Cruise is a hired killer in L.A. for one night to kill 5 people and he hires Foxx's taxi to take him from place to place. An unfortunate event at the first murder makes Foxx an unwilling accomplice. There is a lot of psychological warfare going on from Cruise's character and eventually Foxx begins to fight back. This is a good thriller with an intelligent script and good actors creating good characters. My only problem would be a little bit of a contrived ending but then again maybe I'm thinking too much and I should just shut up and enjoy the movie.</p></body></html>

While the movie departs further from the book, the story is top-notch with the right touch of human element and motivation.<br /><br />However, the camerawork is absolutely, drop-dead painful to watch.  I hate watching a movie where I can't guess what is going on because there's a flurry of "somethings" across the screen while I'm reaching for the Dramamine.  You can almost hear a collective sigh of relief from an entire movie audience when the hyperactive cameraman stops jostling about - presumably because he's throwing up off screen.<br /><br />It's such a pity, too, because I do like the story.  It's worth watching just for that -- hopefully, the camerawork on a TV screen is not as painful an experience.</p></body></html>

Decent cast, story, sets, and music. I bought this and although I wasn't enthralled, I won't be donating it either. I think the directing must have been mediocre. I say this because "The Rock" has turned in some decent performances in other movies. See "The Rundown". I think with better directing this movie would have rocked. The make-up was excellent, and there were great special effects. I think if the cast had a little more character appeal it might have been better. With good directing this would have come out. To me it is up to the director to have a clear view of the characters so he can help the actors develop them. Don't get me wrong, the director does a decent job because the characters are close to being interesting, but they just don't quite make it. The sequence were they have you viewing as though you are in the game was kind of cool. Overall not bad, just not great.</p></body></html>

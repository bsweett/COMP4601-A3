<meta name="summary" content="Strangely unfunny Ferrell film"></head><body><p>Ron Burgundy would have made an interesting character on Saturday Night Live.  Will Ferrell's skills of observation and exaggeration create a familiar, self-absorbed anchorman ripe for satire.  In five minute sketches, Burgundy would have been yet another hilarious contribution to SNL from Ferrell.  But an entire movie?<br /><br />Unlike Buddy from "Elf" or other creations from SNL alums like Austin Powers, Ron Burgundy simply lacks the substance to carry a film.  After the first few scenes, he is just not funny anymore.  Without juvenile bathroom humor, crude sex jokes and a supporting cast filled with exaggerated, freakishly cliched sidekicks, not many laughs would be found in this movie.<br /><br />With that said, Ferrell should be commended for once again tackling a role that requires him to look foolish and unattractive, while asking the audience to laugh AT him (not WITH him).  After equally brave choices in "Elf" and "Old School", Ferrell really seems to be an actor who doesn't take himself too seriously and is without any fear of becoming labeled a "clown".</p></body></html>

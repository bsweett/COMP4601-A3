<meta name="summary" content=""Kill Bill: Volume 2"- Pure Perfection!"></head><body><p>Film: "Kill Bill: Volume 2"<p>Written and Directed by: Quentin Tarantino<p>Cast:<br />The Bride- Uma Thurman<br />Elle Driver- Daryl Hannah<br />Bill- David Carrdine<br />Budd- Michael Madsen<p>Grade: A<p>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I meen it! QT it one of the best directors around and he has crafted a masterpiece! This is his 5th movie and he is in top form. "Kill Bill: Volume 1" was a rollercoster ride of thrills and spills, it had great action and effects with ok acting from Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, and Vivica Fox. But "Kill Bill: Volume 2" is a masterpice! "Kill Bill: Volume 1" was a good movie but "Kill Bill: Volume 2" is pure perfection! QT combines GREAT acting, a compelling plot, moving drama, incredible suspense, excellent sound and effects, fantastic action, hysterical comedy, GREAT directing and script and wounderful dialouge! QT is an amazing director and each one of his movies is a classic, "Resovier Dogs", "Pulp Fiction", "Jackie Brown", "Kill Bill: Volume 1", and now "Kill Bill: Volume 2" is his best movie to date. Though there is no where near as much action was "Kill Bill: Volume 1" some people don't like it. Though the bloody action was fun this movies action was much better and "realistic". I could never see these two films but together because they are totally different! Like I said "Kill Bill: Volume 1" is a adreline rush of action, and "Kill Bill: Volume 2" is a thought provoking charecter drama.<br />The acting is superb! Uma Thurman deserves an Oscar nomination for her role, and Daryl Hannah desreves best suporting actress because she was so good and funny. Uma is a great actress, her performence was so moving I was dumfounded! I can not express in words how good this movie was and I is one of the best movies I have ever seen! Since these are two different movies some will favor the first and some the second, for me the second is wonderful! This is one of my favorite movies and I am amazed how good it is! Bloody well done! Excellent film! I can not wait for QT's 6th movie! Grade A</p></body></html>

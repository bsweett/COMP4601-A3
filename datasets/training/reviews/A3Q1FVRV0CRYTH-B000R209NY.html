Many critics critisized this film saying that it was 'Titanic' without any heart, without a love story and so it wasn't near as good.  But then again, if 'Poseidon' focused on a love story only to have the ship sink and everyone die the critics would say it was just a copy=cat of sorts.  It's pointless to try and be 'Titanic' because it's impossible to improve on that film unless you copy it frame for frame.  So 'Poseidon' decides to throw you almost instantly into action (I mean like within a few minutes) and doesn't let off until the credits roll.  Yes, some of this film is improbable, some of it is a bit cheesy, but for the most part it's a great popcorn flick with excelent graphics and some decent acting (most notably is Jacinda Barrett who plays a single mother)  The story line is pretty simple.  The cruise ship Poseidon is hit by a rogue wave and capsizes.  The captian of the ship orders everyone stay in the ballroom because it's airtight and they can wait for help, but two men think otherwise.  Josh Lucas plays a gambler who was once in the Navy and believes he can get out through the bottom of the ship, and Kurt Russell plays and ex-mayor who is trying to find his daughter (Emmy Rossum) who is in the disco with her boyfriend.  These two men end up taking some others with them including Barrett and her son and Richard Dreyfuss, a man whos lover just left him and is on the verge of suicide...(It's kinda funny to me how he spots the wave coming while he's trying to jump overboard...and I'm thinking 'nows your chance...you're sure to die now' but he turns around and runs...it's kinda funny)  ANyways, theres plenty of action throughout the film and plenty of suspence as well.  There are a few scenes that will make you tense, especially the ventilation shaft scene that everyone is talking about.  All in all the film is very well done and is sure to please fans of the genra...it's no 'Titanic' but we already have one of those!</p></body></html>

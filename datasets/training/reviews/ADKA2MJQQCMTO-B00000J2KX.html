<meta name="summary" content=""Where's the Beef?""></head><body><p>This is going to be a fairly short review.  I'm not going to delve into summarizing the story or critiquing Kubrick's direction.  Frankly, this film has been so heralded and around so long that if you need to be recapped you haven't been paying enough attention.  Long story short, this is one of (if not THE) best haunted house film ever, made by one of the most influential directors in history.<br /><br />Which leads to the question of why I'm giving it a four star rating instead of five?  I'm knocking it a star for the DVD not just EXPLODING with extras.  It's, basically, packed with nothing.  A short half-hour documentary, a commentary by Kubrick's daughter, and a trailer just isn't enough to do this justice.  Where's the commentary by Nicholson or King (who famously didn't enjoy this version)?  Where's the retrospective on how this film impacted the industry?  Where's the reflection by the cast on their experiences on the set?<br /><br />This is a film that should have been an education to dive into and an opportunity to pay homage to a brilliant film-maker.  Warner Bros, however, seem to have decided this wasn't important to us.</p></body></html>

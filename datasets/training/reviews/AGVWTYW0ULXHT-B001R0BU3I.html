<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining and provocative -- but perhaps a bit too heavyhanded with its message"></head><body><p>I really wanted to love this film, and it started out strong.  The cinematography is both gritty and gorgeous and true to the story: to begin with the sunlight is overpowering, the brights that flow through windows or doorways or from the sky are washed out, and the shadows and subtle variations of dark are clear and nuanced; towards the end the sun was less apparent, it always seemed overcast.  This reflects the moral ambiguities that increasingly enter into the characters' visions: that overwhelm the clarity of faith, or of rightness and justice.  The camera movements are both precise and volatile, conveying a sense of the urgency and uncertainty of the situations depicted.  One could learn a lot from paying attention just to the visuals of this film.  I noticed, in particular, that Don Cheadle was always lit in a way to highlight the range of tonalities in his face while allowing him to stand out against a relatively dark background - there is a big difference between the techniques of lighting for pale and dark skin and cinematographer J. Michael Muro deserves a lot of credit throughout for his exceptional work on this film.  (He was also DP for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3XY5A">Crash</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q66FB6">The Last Mimzy</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LV63MW">Flicka</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WGYMTM">Rush Hour 3</a> -- especially for the last three films I think that the cinematography was easily the best thing about them.)  The acting (especially that of Don Cheadle as Samir) and the settings were also quite strong.<br /><br />When it comes to story, things are a bit less subtle.  I think of fiction film as involving four major components: (1) the cinematography (the filming); (2) the "mise-en-scene" (the filmed: including set, actors, props, etc.); (3) the story; (4) the theme.  In the best films, all of these components are in the service of the story -- if the cinematography calls too much attention to itself, or if an actor's presence overwhelms the film, it doesn't quite work.  Likewise, and I think this is the case with Traitor, a film can fail because the story is in the service of the theme.  In the best films, the theme emerges along with the story, but it doesn't feel like the story is simply designed to convey a message: the story has a life of its own and because it feels true and alive it also allows us as viewers to see something about life and this insight is the theme.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in this film, it feels as if the filmmakers designed the plot and the characters precisely in order to convey a message.  Even more troubling is the fact that they appear to have unwittingly introduced a deeper and more problematic message by employing stereotypes that would give a shorthand way of conveying the primary message.  That doesn't mean the story doesn't entertain and doesn't enlighten -- it does --  but I think the message could be more profound if they had been more focused on telling a story than on conveying a specific message.<br /><br />Roughly, the explicit message of the film is that the war on terrorism is complicated, that Islam is complicated.  While there are some who, in the name of Islam, would like to wage a violent war on Western democracy and the American style of capitalism that accompanies it, there are others who, in the name of the same faith, reject that violence and see Jihad as implying an internal struggle.  Don Cheadle's character Samir is designed precisely to illustrate this tension: he is willing to accept violence as a means to fight against the usurpation of Islam by militant extremists, because he is ultimately a man of peace who aims to overcome his own anger.  Although this character seems contrived by the writers precisely to illustrate something, Don Cheadle breathes life into him and he does appear to be real.  What makes the message heavy handed is the way that characters are constantly stating to each other the allegedly profound insights we are supposed to be gleaning from the plot: Neal McDonough and Guy Pearce play FBI agents who express, respectively, the stereotypically patriotic American point of view and a more nuanced point of view that gradually comes to respect Samir for his faith (conveyed in a very heavy-handed way during an extremely improbable  encounter between the agent and Samir in the final scene of the film).<br /><br />But what undermines even this apparently nuanced message about Islam (that faith is not the enemy, and that Islam has within itself the resources to combat its more extreme interpretations) is the implicit message conveyed within the story.  It turns out that, according to the story, the real terrorists, the guys who run things and call the shots, are really just opportunistic hypocrites.  The leaders of the terrorist cell that is at the heart of this story have lots of money, enjoy wine and women and cigars and nice cars.  They are really just capitalists who are exploiting the faith of the pawns they use as suicide bombers in order to enrich themselves.  There may be a good deal of truth to this -- but I think it oversimplifies things, suggesting that the heart of all global conflict is just greed.  That's a message that is easy to swallow, but doesn't offer much in the way of insight.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="evil but grainy"></head><body><p>This is one of the best horror movies of the 1980's.  That being said starz could have done a better job cleaning up the grainy picture.  It is still a improvement over the standard dvd release though.  Therefore it is a welcome addition to my collection. However I am going to email starz and ask them why at the more expensive prices of blu ray that they don't treat each release like a special edition.  After all few of us are going to replace this version with a new blu ray version that costs 40.00 just to get deleted scenes.  At this price all blu rays should be treated as special editions and deliver any deleted scenes that such a edition would have.  Starz is not the only company doing this either.  So it is worth the effort to email any studio and say that if you expect us to pay these higher prices, then we should expect it to be released  like a special edition.</p></body></html>

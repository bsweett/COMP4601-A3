<meta name="summary" content="Aeon Flux meets Underworld and V for Vendetta"></head><body><p>Ultraviolet sheds light on a futuristic society that has been plagued by a virus that nearly transformed the population into hemophages (vampire-like creatures), but has survived and is now on its way back to full recovery.<br />A carrier of the virus takes it upon herself to steal the government's secret project believing that it is a weapon meant to destroy them.  What she ends up with, however, maybe more than she bargained for...<br />There are strong elements/hints of Aeon Flux, Underworld, and V for Vendetta, so the movie falls into the sci-fi/action/adventure type of category.<br />Apart from Milla Jovovich (who is GORGEOUS!!!) and the lovely colors seen throughout the film, the plot and the dialogues are poor at best.<br />The rest of the cast is mediocre.  As for the computer graphics, they are not that great and often one gets the feeling that they are watching a computer game of average graphics instead of a motion picture.<br />Though not a masterpiece and probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, Ultraviolet might provide for an evening's entertainment.  3.5 Stars</p></body></html>

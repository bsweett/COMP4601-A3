<meta name="summary" content="well worth the watch"></head><body><p>i enjoyed Casablanca,but i wouldn't say it changed my life.it's a<br />pleasant movie,with a good story,good acting,a good locale and an<br />interesting cast of characters.there are some memorable lines,to be<br />sure,but some of them some seem a bit corny.there were one or two eye<br />rolling sentimental lines delivered by Humprey Bogart to Ingred<br />Bergman.but i realize that's probably due to the fact that the movie<br />was made almost 60 years ago.regardless,it's well worth watching,in my<br />opinion.there's no special effects.so it's really all about the<br />characters,the story,and the acting.if those elements aren't<br />successful,then the movie won't work.in this case,they are.for<br />me,Casablanca is a 3.5/5</p></body></html>

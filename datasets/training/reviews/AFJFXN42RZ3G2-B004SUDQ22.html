<meta name="summary" content="Significance of the "i""></head><body><p>PROOF turned out to be an extraordinary film of 2005.  It was intellectually and intelligently done, and it even stars two of the most versatile actors today, Jake Gyllenhaal (Hal) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Catherine) as well as seasoned actor, Anthony Hopkins (Robert Llewyln) and supporting actress, Hope Davis (Claire).  The core of the film centers on Catherine coming to terms with her father's passing, and what evolves from her experience is her struggle with her identity.  Who is she? and What is it that she really wants to be or does not want to be?  The film goes through the process of her grasping and grappling with the reality that she too is a mathematician as her father, but she appears to deny it or hide it for fear of upstaging his  work.  In addition, Catherine temporary loses her ability to make pertinent choices that would reflect her own life.<br /><br />The film is intense and perplexing.  The direction by John Madden and the screenplay by David Auburn and Rebecca Miller were highly effective in showing the complicated storyline, and their use of flashbacks allowed the viewer to understand Catherine's relationship and her witness to her father's debilitating condition.  Also, the investigative technique used to reveal the truth behind Catherine's father's notebook and Catherine was quite intriguing as well.<br /><br />I recommend this film for anyone who likes a thought provoking film.  You certainly do not have to be a mathematician to solve this Proof, but it will keep your mind reeling.</p></body></html>

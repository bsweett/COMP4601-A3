Harvard Symbologist is called to the Vatican to investigate the kidnapping of four cardinals. The kidnapper promises to murder each one of them to avenge a centuries old crime. The movie then develops in to a thriller with its chase scenes and near escapes. Tom Hank as Robert Langdon is good; he has a new partner in Vittoria Vetra. The movie worked because it is a travelogue on the Vatican with its incredible history and gives you brief glimpses in the world of the Papacy and its rituals and traditions.  The movie takes us on a historical tour of the Vatican and surroundings. For me the movie belonged to Evan Mcgregor who played the humble servant of god with ulterior motives and fit his part to a perfect T. Armin Mueller Stahl, whom I last enjoyed in the `The International' was great as trying to preserve the traditions of the church. Loved it as a fast paced entertainer so I gave it four stars.2/1/10</p></body></html>

Even so, I could not help but fall in love with this edition from the first moment I saw it. Yes, it takes some artistic license to make its own distinguised "Hairspray" but it was fun, colorful, and rowsing.  I immediately fell in love with the almost ditzy whirl of fun as well as the juxtaposition of the racism story.  I know truer fans of "Hairspray" could pick this apart, but a novice like me fell wildly in love with the inspirational and heartfelt film.</p></body></html>

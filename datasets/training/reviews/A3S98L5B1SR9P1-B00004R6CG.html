<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock's BEST!"></head><body><p>Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" is surely his best! Jimmy Stewart plays detective John Furgusen, who has had a fear of heights ever since he tried to save his partner from falling off a roof while chasing a criminal and failed. He retired until one day an old high school buddy asks him to follow his wife. John later finds that he has caught himself into a web of lies that he cannot escape. A wonderful classic. I think everyone should see this and the other Hitchcock films.</p></body></html>

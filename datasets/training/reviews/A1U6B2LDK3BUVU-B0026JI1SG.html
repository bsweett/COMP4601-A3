<meta name="summary" content="Much too depressing"></head><body><p>This film has a lot of strengths to it.  Good acting, some good turns of the plot, some characters to care about.  But it is really just too damn depressing at the end.  What's going on?  We start out with a good action movie, a sports triumph.  How did we get from there to "Gee, I hope someone kills off the main character soon".<br /><br />All I can say is - What were you thinking?  Why did you take this film in that direction?  Why exploit that particular emotion?  A film is a work of art, and just like any other work of art, it is free to go where it chooses.  Why did this one go to the depths of depression?  Do I really have to follow you there?<br /><br />Gee.  Pass the popcorn.  What is this, Ibsen?<br /><br />Greatness and depression are not synonyms.  Reminds me of the Saty Nite Live skits of Mr. Bill.  Oh nooooooooooooo.  Uh oh, we'll have to cut off your leg now.  Oh Nooooooooooo.  Uh oh, we'll have to cut off your tongue now.  Oh nooooooooooooooo.  Uh oh, we'll have to kill you now.  Oh nooooooooooooooooooo.</p></body></html>

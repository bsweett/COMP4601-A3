<meta name="summary" content="Reasonable movie, great concept, good suspense"></head><body><p>This was a better than average, pleasent surprise when I saw it in theaters, and was descent when I saw it again.  Aston Kutcher plays a kid who has had several bumps in the road over the years, but discovers a special "gift" while studying late at night.  He findsa that he is able to travel back to times of high emotions in his life where he can have a chance to alter the course that his life takes.  Soon he discovers there is more behind this gift that what he could ever imagine.<br />This is a reasonable film that was just fun to watch, and the dvd has a lot of extras, including an alternate ending that I am very glad the hollywood producers did not make the original ending.  Check this out, chances are you will be surprised too.</p></body></html>

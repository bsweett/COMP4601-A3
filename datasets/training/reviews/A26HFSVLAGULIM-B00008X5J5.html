I had seen it years ago in the theaters and a couple more times over the decades, but I had never seen the color of it like I did on this Special Edition DVD. Wow! Everything is so vibrant! My son and I are color fanatics, so it had our attention right from the start.<br /><br />Sleeping Beauty is visually arresting. Aurora is one of the most lovely creations of our time and Mary Costa's beautiful voice is perfectly suited to the artwork. The green of Maleficent's cruel visage practically leaps off the screen. The backgrounds are intricately detailed and thoughtfully stylized. The three fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, are delightful, especially Merryweather and her petulant intonations (you may recognize her as the well-bred Lady of "Lady and the Tramp"). The reworking of Tchaikovsky's classic melodies lends a lovely, lilting tone to the settings and characters.<br /><br />The digital transfer and restoration is wonderful and I like that you have the option of viewing the film in either wide- or fullscreen format. I invariably select the widescreen, but I do understand that others do not care for the black bars. The features on the second disk are pleasant and informative for the entire family. There are plenty of fun activities for the children such as the "Princess Personality Profile", the "Sleeping Beauty Ink & Paint Game", and the "Rescue Aurora Adventure Game". Nostalgia buffs will enjoy the inclusion of vintage programming such as "The Peter Tchaikovsky Story" and "Four Artists Paint One Tree".<br /><br />Don't miss the chance to add this classic to your movie collection right away!</p></body></html>

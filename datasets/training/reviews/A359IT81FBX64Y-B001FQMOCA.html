<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable"></head><body><p>I'm in a pickle, as with any movie biography. If I say I enjoyed the film and learned something, then there will always be the "experts" who will say how much the movie got wrong or how some things were emphasized at the expense of other, perhaps more important, things. So all I'm going to say is that I enjoyed watching this film, and I think Joaquin and Reese did a great job "impersonating" Johnny and June. I've never been a fan of Cash, but I liked listening to the songs here, and I wanted more singing. The romance between Johnny and June, with all its warts and faults, was touching as well. Even "bad, messed up" people (i.e. people who make lots of stupid mistakes) can work things out, it seems.</p></body></html>

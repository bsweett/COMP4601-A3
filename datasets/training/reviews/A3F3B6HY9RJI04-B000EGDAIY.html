<meta name="summary" content="Lost In Translation??"></head><body><p>This movie was a remake of the Japanese Horror film Ju-On: The Grudge.  In fact, it even has the same director.  However, I think there are a lot of things taken for granted in Japan that Americans don't really understand.<br /><br />So at the end of the movie I was left scratching my head thinking, "What did I just watch?"  I understand how the killings started, so maybe a better question was, "What was the point of this?"  The ending is not an ending at all, but more an opening for a possible sequel.<br /><br />The strongest aspect of this movie was that the bulk of the gore was left to the imagination of the viewer.  You don't see people getting killed, you see it coming and then the rest is up to you.  I think this actually makes it more scary than seeing what actually does happen.<br /><br />The best part is that it lowers the rating from an 'R' rating to a 'PG-13' so more people can see it.  With an 'R' rating, this movie would not have made as much as it actually did.<br /><br />However, if you like a scary movie then go ahead and watch this.  If you don't like them as they keep you up for weeks with nightmares (and you don't want this) then stick with Mary Poppins.  This movie will have you jumping a couple of times.</p></body></html>

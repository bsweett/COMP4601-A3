<meta name="summary" content="Was that Lindsey Lohan (yes!)?"></head><body><p>Based on the 70s exploitation flicks that had a stupid plot and enough sex and violence if you weren't laughing at the stupid plot.<br />There's a lot of known actors and actresses in this picture so they're all in on the joke.  That said, you have to like these types of films and I have mixed feelings about it.  Didn't really grow up with this stuff so it's a bit weird at times, though, I did laugh at the intestinal scene.  DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: C plus to B minus; VIOLENCE/SEX: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: Mid March 2011.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Bourne Identity"></head><body><p>In the vein of &quot;keep-you-guessing&quot; movies like the excellent MEMENTO, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is an exciting movie with enough fast-paced action to sustain audiences during the action movie madness that is Hollywood. The film rests largely on Matt Damon's shoulders and thankfully he has enough acting chops to make you believe the character. The compelling story lends itself well to a film, which, while not completly an out-and-out action thriller, contains some fantastically contrived set-pieces, like the exciting car chase and the final showdown where Bourne finds the answers to the thorny problem of who he actually is. One of the few brainy action films of late, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is one exciting ride.</p></body></html>

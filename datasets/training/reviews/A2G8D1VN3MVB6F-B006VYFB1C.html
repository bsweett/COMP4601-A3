Sorry for the cheese!!!!"></head><body><p>This movie does a great job of relating how a small market team attempted to compete with the evil Yankees. It is based on a true story, or largely based on a true story. The story is great, the acting is great, and it was well shot. It was well written, and was one the best paced baseball movies that I have ever come across. Get it, and enjoy!!!!!</p></body></html>

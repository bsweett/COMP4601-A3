<meta name="summary" content="Wonderland - A New View"></head><body><p>In many ways this is a good movie but is  it  Lewis Carroll's "Alice"?  Burton has taken some of the characters from Alice and "Through The Looking Glass" and stuffed them into this screen play which seems to be constructed from scraps of the books but with a  new and darker view.  The original works were very episodic but Burton has added details  and  more  of a plot in an attempt to make sense out of the original.  The result is a movie that is well done but barely resembles Alice.  However, many of the Alice characters are spectacularly drawn.  The Cheshire Cat is particularly well done as are Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, but the Dormouse seems to have drunk to much caffeine.  Depp's Mad Hatter is well done but is a new  and different  character whose madness seems to be  in his dress and appearance rather than in any disconnect from reality.  Gone are the talking flowers, the Duchess, and  many other parts of Wonderland along with Alice the young girl.  Instead the movie begins with Alice -- who is now 21 rather than 12 -- at a party.  This sequence is too long too boring and a ridiculous attempt to avoid the governess and a bored Alice falling down a rabbit  hole.  The end  of the movie concludes with another 10 minutes of these ridiculous people which does nothing for the film other than extend  it.  But, as bad as this party is it  is trumped by the totally awful dance done by Depp at the end of the movie.  The Jitterbug scene  was scrapped from Wizard of OZ because it would have spoiled the movie -- the Depp Dance Scene should have been scrapped from this one because it really ruined this movie.<br /><br /> Burton's "Nightmare Before Christmas" was very well done and clearly he wanted to meet or  exceed that standard but alas he has fallen short.  Nevertheless this is a  spectacular movie in many ways.  Wonderland is truly a wonder and the various characters very well done.  But Alice In Wonderland it  is not.  It is worth seeing but not worth seeing  again.  It is a 3 star effort at best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Romantic Film about Magic, Mystery and True Love"></head><body><p>This is the perfect Valentine's Day film or date movie that has magic, mystery, scandal and romance.  Set in beautiful turn of the century Vienna, this is the story of two young lovers of completely different social standing who meet again after 15 years.  Jessica Biel beautifully plays a duchess betrothed to marry the heir to the Austrian Empire (Rufus Sewell), a cruel man with grand ambition to be emperor and sees Eisenheim the Magician, wonderfully and charmingly played by Edward Norton, as a threat to his authority. Paul Giamatti plays Chief Inspector Uhl who is employed by the Crown Prince to arrest Eisenheim for Fraud.  Uhl is our vehicle in the story who leads us through the mystery behind the scandalous love triangle and the fantastic tricks Eisenheim produces that both fascinates and confounds the plot even further.  In the end, it was worth the journey.<br /><br />Phillip Glass's simple score repeats throughout the movie, enhancing the enigmatic and romantic quality of the film.  This is a must see by all.</p></body></html>

But then over time forget what I loved so much about it, and when I finally get the dvd all those months later, I watch it again and love it even more than I did when I first saw it. The same thing happened to me with Iron Man, Star Trek, Batman Begins, Casino Royale, and a whole laundry list of what are now most of my favorite all-time movies. District 9 is no exception. I recently watched it again, and it was ten times better the second time. Neil Blomkamp is a relatively unknown director, but he created a masterpiece. I think D9 is a classic, and it definitely should not be forgotten as the years go by. Sadly, I believe it will be forgotten because of the big shadow that Avatar casts. One thing that District 9 has is an uncanny originality that I had almost forgot existed in the movie business today. Most notibly in the alien sub-genre. Too many alien films follow the same suit. Unlike most other alien movies, the prawns are not portrayed as villains. They are victims. It kind of made me sad to see how they were mistreated. One thing D9 does do is evoke different emotions. The movie is gritty and tense, sometimes sad, yet funny at times. Despite the fact that it is not a conventional action movie, the scenes when the action does pick up are breathtaking. Literally, if you're squemish. I happen to be a very little bit squemish, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching mens' arms, heads, and even entire torsos a couple times, get disintergrated by the prawns' various guns.<br /><br />The cinematography in this film is nothing short of amazing. I never thought it was possible to be that captivated by the sight of a poor African slum, but D9 managed to surprise me more than a few times. The visual effects are spot on. I would even go as far as to say that they were way more realistic and believable than my favorite movie of 2009 (I doubt i have to name it). I have to mention the transformation of Wikus himself, brilliantly played by Sharlto Copley. I was glad that they used actual make up and tangible materials to create the prawn arm, rather than relying completely on CGI. I do love it, but I still have to admit that CGI has become a crutch for most. Speaking of Sharlto Copley's performance, how did he not get any major awards nominations? At least the Academy gave District 9 a nod for Best Picture, Visual Effects, Adapted Screenplay and Editing. Rather than the Best Pic nomination being a spot filler, I think it actually could have been a contender if the competion were not so strong this year. Nevertheless, District 9 is a work of genius and i do hope that there is a District 10. There were a lot of hints to it at the end of D9, so they better not disappoint. Thank God Peter Jackson and his team couldn't make that Halo movie they original set out to make, otherwise we would never have gotten District 9.</p></body></html>

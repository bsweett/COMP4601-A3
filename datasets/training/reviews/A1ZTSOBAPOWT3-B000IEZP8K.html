<meta name="summary" content="The Rock is a Genius"></head><body><p>Even though The Rock only appears in the movie for about three minutes, his role is very important to the story. As the Scorpion King, The Rock is a leader of the people turned bad. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his wife (Rachel Weisz) are back for a new adventure along with their nine-year-old son Alex (an annoying little rascal). Why spend your money to watch them though? It's all about the WWE star. The plot is thin reviving Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), the mummy from the first film, to capture the Scorpion King's bracelet which will control mysterious Egyptian soldiers who merely look like dogs with staffs and hoods. Oh yes, if it wasn't for The Rock, none of this would have ever happened. The Rock's face is funny and he yells in a strange language. It was far out! Talk about the birth of a new genius. He was the lone survivor after a huge battle (characteristic of a genius) and he destroyed many people. It was an honor to watch &quot;The People's Champion&quot; kick some bootay outside of the ring. Please! Hollywood Hulk Hogan and Triple H are nothing compared to The Rock. The &quot;People's Eyebrow&quot; was missing in action, but thank you to the wizards who made &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;. The three minutes of The Rock is the whole movie and he made it worthwhile. Oh yes. Good job Stephen Sommers and cast, but I praise The Rock for being a new deity.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A CLASSIC IT IS NOT!"></head><body><p>A take-off on the movie - THE JACKAL - with Bruce Willis -<br /><br />Tom Cruise as a hit man just does not pull it off.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx was decent as the troubled cab-driver.<br /><br />Plenty of action - fairly fast paced --- but what ever happened to the police?  Did they end up closing their case?<br /><br />Too many questions left unanswered.<br /><br />Will probably have to see it again sometime to see what I missed.</p></body></html>

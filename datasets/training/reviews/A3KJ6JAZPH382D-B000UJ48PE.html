<meta name="summary" content="Hostel-ity"></head><body><p>When the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHRVP6">Hostel</a> was released, I was surprised at the manner in which Eli Roth (with a little help from his pal Quentin Tarantino) upended the horror template with a political allegory. In the original, all the victims were male, putzes, and essentially unlikable. You had to almost force yourself to root for Paxton even though you thought he was a first class A-hole. Add the relatively spooky plot and you had a better than average scare flick. Naturally, Hostel's success all but mandated a sequel.<br /><br />And just as naturally, Hostel II blows chunks of body parts. Having used up all the original ideas in version one, Roth resorts to cliches for version two. The all-female victims are a central-casting clutch of American Students studying art abroad. You have the uber-nerd, uber-beyocth and uber-rich all lured to the infamous factory, where one by one, they get chased, trapped and captured for their trips to the chamber of horrors. The attempt at altering the obvious is done by giving us a glimpse at the manner of attracting clients to the factory, which is given a semi-funny montage. You also get to meet the brains behind the "Elite Hunting" organization, which removes some of the suspense...he's just another wealthy European aristocrat.<br /><br />Eventually the three girls are brought in for their torture-kills. While "Hostel 2" does up the gore from volume one, the shock value is wasted. It's just mindless killing for the sake of titillation (although the too-short power cord was good for a nervous release chuckle), and Roth seemed more interested in seeing how many taboos he could cram into 90 minutes. Kill a kid? Check. Rape? Check. Cannibalism? Check. Gross-outs involving animals? Check check and triple check. It all adds up to a mind-numbing montage of excess without substance.<br /><br />About the only place where "Hostel 2" outdoes its predecessor is the final twist. When it's time for the obligatory final victim to escape, the manner in which she does so did manage to throw me. It was the only thing about this movie that was unexpected, saving it from a single star rating. But given the generally weak reception this received at the Box Office (and the general slippage in the 'torture-porn' genre box-office all around - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V4UH0I">Captivity</a> anyone?), my guess is we'll all be spared the indignity of Hostel 3.</p></body></html>

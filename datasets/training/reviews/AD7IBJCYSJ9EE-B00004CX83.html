Even though it is a bit undershadowed by Begins, it's a great film!<br /><br /> THE PLOT: Gotham City is a dark, unsafe, and criminal-filled city. Until a mysterious hero in a batsuit arrives. He is Batman, the Caped Crusader.<br /><br /> Vicky Vale is a pretty photo-journalist who wants to uncover the secret of this "Batman."<br /><br /> Jack Naiper was an enforcer for his boss, until the day he fell into a vat of acid in a firefight at a chemical factory. He now is disfigured and insane. He is the Joker, and he's out to take over Gotham city.<br /><br /> Bruce Wayne is a billionare living with his butler, Alfred. Not much is known about him.<br /><br /> Can Batman defeat the Joker? Who is Bruce Wayne? Will Vicky ever discover the true identity of this "Batman?" Find out and see!<br /><br /> OPINION: Another great Tim Burton movie! It's a great superhero movie, filled with action, gadgets, and fun!<br /><br /> One of the best parts of this movie is the Joker. Jack Nicholson is PERFECT as the Joker. So random and funny, in a dark way.<br /><br /> The atmosphere is dark and gloomy. Just right for the film.<br /><br /> OVERALL: A great superero movie that's perfect for a Saturday night. Check out the other Batman films, too!</p></body></html>

Artificial Intelligence and Minority Report, Steven Spielberg returns to more lighter fare with the engaging and entertaining Catch Me If You Can.  The film is based on the true story of Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., who by the age of nineteen passes himself off as a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer and cashes over four million dollars worth of fraudulent checks.  The film is told in a flashback style, opening with Frank being extricated from a French prison and brought back to the U.S. to face charges and bounces back and forth between his trip home and his exploits in the previous few years.  Leonardo DiCaprio is perfectly cast as Frank.  His boyish good looks and charm work to his advantage as the young con man.  Mr. DiCaprio gives a multi-layered performance as beneath the surface Frank is really a young man who is devastated by his parents divorce and wants only to please his father and see his parents back together again.  Mr. DiCaprio has never been better and it is certainly the equal of his Oscar nominated performance in What&#65533;s Eating Gilbert Grape.  Tom Hanks gives yet another superb performance as the dogged FBI agent Carl Hanratty who tracks Frank across the US and eventually to France where he finally captures him.  Mr. Hanks plays Carl as a by-the-numbers agent, who shows no outward mercy to Frank, but has compassion for the kid because of his situation.  Christopher Walken is excellent as well as Frank&#65533;s father, who loses everything to the IRS because of a fraud investigation.  His contempt towards the government as they strip away everything in his life is both hilarious and heartbreaking.  Mr. Walken received a deserved nomination as Best Supporting Actor in 2002.  There are other good performances by Amy Adams as a girl who Frank becomes engaged to, Martin Sheen as her father, Nathalie Baye as Frank&#65533;s French mother and Jennifer Garner has a bizarre cameo as a model who propositions Frank for an evening of pleasure.  While these performances are all since, they are mere sidebars to the triangle between Frank, Carl and Frank&#65533;s father.  The cat and mouse hunt between Frank and Carl is tension filled and briskly paced.  Mr. Spielberg keeps the action moving and he never lets you up for air.  The film has been criticized for not diving deeper into what made Frank do what he did or get in the mechanics of fraud, but that&#65533;s not the point of the film.  It is the chase between the two leads.  You know that Frank will eventually get caught, but where, when and how will it happen.  Mr. Spielberg does gloss over some issues and the film does take some liberties, most notably that is no real Carl Hanratty.  Frank did have a main contact at the FBI, but there was a large team of investigators who tracked and caught him.  But the role of Carl is needed in the film as the chase becomes personal and the emotional focus of the film.  All in all, Catch Me If You Can is perfectly crafted film, full of lively performances, a sharp script and crisp direction.  This film yet again shows why Mr. Spielberg is among the greatest directors of this or any generation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The quintessential James Bond film"></head><body><p>This is the quintessential James Bond film.  If our civilization wanted to prepare a time capsule to save for the 31st century, this would be the James Bond film we would want to enclose.  Although I personally think that FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is a slightly better film, absolutely no James Bond pulls all the essential Bond elements together more perfectly.  In fact, if there is a James Bond formula (and there is), it was completed to perfection in GOLDFINGER.  Probably the best opening song of any Bond film, probably the best Bond villain and villain name, one of the best love interests and names, the definitive car (in the books Bond is attached to a Bentley, but in the films we primarily associate him with his Aston Martin), and best evil henchman (Odd Job).  And possibly the best throwaway line in all the Bond films.  As a laser cuts through the metal slab upon which Goldfinger has strapped Bond, he yells, "Do you expect for me to talk?"  "No, Mr. Bond, I expect for you to die."<p>This movie has permeated popular culture to a degree matched by few films.  Nearly all the elements we associate with suave, debonair spies come from this film, though some influences are more esoteric.  Extreme Monty Python fans know that that merry band borrowed both their name and the typeface used in on their show from the side of Pussy Galore's airplanes, which read, "Pussy Galore's Flying Circus."  <p>Of all the Bond films, this one has my favorite villain in Gert Frobe.  Unbelievably, in filming it turned out that Frobe's English was too marginal for him to supply his own dialog, so in the studio they had another actor dub in all Goldfinger's lines.  The dubbing is seamless, and it is nearly impossible to detect that Frobe's own voice wasn't utilized.  <p>This was also the first Bond film to feature what is now the standard and essential international jet setting.  DR. NO was filmed pretty much entirely in Jamaica, and although FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE had some exotic locales, most of it was shot in Istanbul or on the Orient Express.  In GOLDFINGER, however, Bond earns major frequent flier miles.  He starts off in Miami, and then goes back to a couple of sites in England.  After a channel crossing to Switzerland, he is transported to the US and Louisville, Kentucky and from there to Fort Knox.  This kind of diversity is now an absolute requirement of any Bond outing.  One isn't at all surprised if a Bond film starts off in Mongolia, proceeds to the Balkan Islands, briefly to England, from there to Alaska, with the grand finale in an island in the Atlantic, meeting beautiful women and foiling dastardly villains at every step along the way.</p></body></html>

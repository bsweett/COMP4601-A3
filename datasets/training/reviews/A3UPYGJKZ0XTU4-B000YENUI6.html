And Perhaps for Salvation Too."></head><body><p>Director David Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen reunite for another intriguing meditation on the place of violence following 2005's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQLZ0Q">A History of Violence</a>. "Eastern Promises" submerges us in the underworld of the Russian mafia, or "vory y zacone". When a teenager known only as "Tatiana" dies giving birth in a London hospital, her midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) hopes that translating the young woman's diary will help locate the baby's family. This leads Anna to an imposing Russian restaurateur, Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), who would be happy to translate the diary. But it soon becomes clear that Tatiana was a victim of the Russian mafia, and her diary incriminates Semyon and his alcoholic, uncontrollable son Kirill (Vincent Cassell). Kirill's inscrutable driver Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen) is asked to retrieve the diary but grows fond of Anna.<br /><br />Truth be told, there is nothing exceptional about this script. The storyline is simple and improbable. Most characters are underwritten and fulfill roles more than they represent three-dimensional people. At times I felt like the landscape was populated with cliches. But where "Eastern Promises" succeeds, it is unforgettable. Viggo Mortensen's Nikolai walks a fine line, exploiting an odd relationship with incompetent, delusional Kirill, who seems more like his ward than his boss, to advance his own ambitions. Vincent Cassell also deserves praise for Kirill's brutal and pitiful dysfunction. But "Eastern Promises" will surely be remembered for its extraordinary fight scene, where a nude, tattooed Nikolai fights for his life in a protracted struggle with two fully-clothed assailants. It is so striking and affecting that it qualifies as one of cinema's great visual triumphs. In English and Russian with subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2007): There are 2 bonus features. "Secrets and Stories" (10 min) interviews director David Cronenberg, writer Stephen Knight, and the cast about  the meaning of "vory y zacone" or "thief in law", the while slave trade depicted in the movie, story, characters, themes, and the language issues. "Marked for Life" (7 min) discusses the significance of tattooing, which acts as an identity card or resume in Russian prisons, their symbology, and applying tattoos for the movie. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, French, and Spanish. Dubbing available in French.</p></body></html>

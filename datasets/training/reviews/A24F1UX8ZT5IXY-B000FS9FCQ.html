<meta name="summary" content="Never quite transcends its soliloquies."></head><body><p>Amazingly enough, V for Vendetta winds up being quite a memorable film. It is no tour de force, the 1984 homages are ridiculously simplistic, a dull subplot mires the entire affair -- but the core message and dramatic high points of the film are undeniable. Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving both give inspired performances, backed with a surprising amount of emotional depth.<br /><br />Much of the revolutionary talk is treated in a pithy fashion, and it is very apparent that we are watching material evolved from a comic book. This is anarchism light, shirking any real discussion of the political ramifications of anything beyond totalitarian rule and its obliteration. It would have been nice and much more meaningful to have not only heard but experienced scenes that developed out of a more complex conception of the political realm.<br /><br />Yet, despite it all I found myself myself enjoying the whole thing. Realistically, I would give the film 3 and a half stars -- but extra points need be given for the ending credits song.</p></body></html>

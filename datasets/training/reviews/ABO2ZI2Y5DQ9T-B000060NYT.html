<meta name="summary" content="A Bit Confused Modern Answer to Old-fashioned Horror Films"></head><body><p>For all virtually unknown actors of the film, Japanese release of "Jeepers Creepers" was a national-wide, theatrical one, which is surprising, even considering the fact that it has got the U.S. No.1 position of weekend box-office chart.  But the reason was to be soon clear: for the film was executive-produced by Francis Ford Coppola, and on the Japanese poster his name was printed prominently, as if Coppola himself directed this work.  I wish he did.<p>Justin Long and Gina Philips are ordinary pair of a brother and a sisiter on the way home until they saw a lusty brown truck rushing from behind.  Not a usual sight on the country road, you know, and nearly they got killed by this spooky truck flying like a bat from hell, they get duely curious.  It ia a foolish thing, of course, but as some wise guy said long time ago, to err is human.  So, they decide to stop the car in order to get a good, clear peep into the place where the truck pulled over.  But wait a minute, the driver might be someone you should never meet, someone not very friendly.  <p>"Jeepers Creepers" is, indeed, a scary movie if you could devide the whole work into three parts, and see them one by one.  In fact, the film's script is made as if having three segments, each of which shows this weird "driver" in point in  different forms.  However, this is the part where many inveterate horror flick fans' opinions divide; some say the film changes its rules too much, making it a nonsense in the end; others say it is a unique, good, old-fashioned horror movie.  The truth is, the director Victor Salva ("Powder")  gives his own visions as a homage to old, classic genre films -- thriller, horror, monster flick, respectively -- but fails to hold them together with a tight grip.  Each scene is shot with a keen eye to details, to be sure, and the introduction of "Jeepers" is really a knockout scene: just look at a dashing truck coming suddenly from the back of the car, which surely gives you a genuine thrill.  <p>However, the stylish visuals of the film is made, sacrificing its storyline, which eventually recedes into a series of simple homages to films in the past.  The first part is clearly inspired by Spielberg's "The Duel"; the middle part with ominous ravens is a homage to Roger Corman productions like Poe's adaptation; the final chapter, showing a winged strange craeture, naturally reminds us of the monster flicks made in the 40s and 50s -- such as "The Thing" as you may remember.  The total effects of the film, therefore, never go beyond that of those past masterpieces, and as a result, its shocking wrap-up scene seems to be covering up the fact that the script of the whole film needs re-writing, which would have definitely saved this rather uneven, illogical horror film from being what it is. <p>The two leads are good, if not particuarly superb, showing exactly a realistic bond of sister/brotherhood, and Eileen Brennan's cameo adds a propelling power that "Jeepes" sometimes lacks.  I know there's a plan of sequel, but hope they take more time to produce it next time.</p></body></html>

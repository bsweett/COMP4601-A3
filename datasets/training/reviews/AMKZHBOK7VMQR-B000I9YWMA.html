<meta name="summary" content="Graphic , well paced , dramatization of the Jack The Ripper story"></head><body><p>The Hughes Brothers created a nightmarish vision of Victorian London only matched by some of Dickens novels. Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are fabulous as the police inspector investigating the case and a prostitute who is a friend to the victims.<br /><br />The film is beautifully shot and the atmosphere of the grimy southside of London is captured incredibly well. The murder scenes are very graphic and this is definitely not for the squeemish or the very young. Depp plays a role similar to the one he played in Sleepy Hollow but this is a much more serious movie aimed at a different audience. My kids loved Sleepy Hollow but I wouldn't let them watch this. It would give them nightmares for a week.<br /><br />The plot is interesting and while fictional it has enough plausibilty to engage the viewer for it's entire length.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is an incredible talent. After seeing him in this,Pirates, Slepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands I have to conclude that this guy is the best actor of his generation. He is always interesting to watch.</p></body></html>

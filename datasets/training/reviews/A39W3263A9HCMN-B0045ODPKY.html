<meta name="summary" content="2.5/5- Fun while it lasts, but leaves a "salty" taste in your mouth afterward"></head><body><p>If one female can bring in the summer action fare, it's Angelina Jolie. 2 years ago we got "Wanted", where she played the smokin' hot Fox (her name certainly is right), the smart and super-tattooed female who leads poor, depressed Wesley to a clan of assassins called The Fraternity. Now 2 years later, she returns with "Salt", which, as you could tell from the trailer, is your typical summer action flick. So if you're expecting anything deep like "Inception", do be prepared to be disappointed. But if you're like me, asking for just a summer action flick, then you'll be satisfied.<br /><br />Evelyn Salt works in a cubicle in a CIA-owned office building. It's her anniversary day, and she is trying to figure out a perfect way to hold her anniversary dinner with her arachnid-fascinated husband Mike. She is called to interrogate a mysterious Russian man when she finds herself in two troublesome situations: 1) Rumor is spreading that she is working with Russian Intelligence and 2) In 24 hours, the Russian president will be assassinated by a Russian spy upon giving a Eulogy at the Vice President of the USA's funeral. She must prove her innocence from this accusation, as well as stop this spy from assassinating the Russian president.<br /><br />So yeah, a typical summer fare plot. Obviously you know that half the movie will just be Angelina beating guys up, and this film does not disappoint in that aspect. Action-wise, this film has some great action scenes, including a particularly exciting car chase that involves Angelina jumping from truck to truck. Her stunt work is quite impressive too, and it has some of her best stunts she's performed since the Tomb Raider movies. She is in great shape evidently, and so therefore her action scene work is quite fun to watch. Acting wise, she really can act, and she shows it well enough here.<br /><br />So yeah, it's fun and all. Good twist near the end makes it worth it as well. So why 2.5 stars? Because really, this film is like a fast food hamburger. Enjoyable while consumed, yet after, you're left with a lingering stomach ache. After the film, you're left wondering why you watched it, just like after you finish eating a fast food burger, you're left wondering why you ate it, despite the enjoyment you got out of it.<br /><br />In short, It's worth it while it lasts, and that's mainly it.</p></body></html>

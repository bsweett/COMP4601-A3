<meta name="summary" content="Western drama"></head><body><p>This is a western for the ages set in late nineteen century Montana.<br /><br />A saloon girl is beaten and knife-cut. Her coworkers are angry but the sheriff (Gene Hackman) does not want to do much about it. Her coworkers put up a thousand dollar reward to obtain justice, but the reward only draws undesirables and brings trouble to Big Whiskey, Montana.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris join forces in an effort to obtain the reward money. After the setting, the story is mainly about the confrontation within the trio and the sheriff and the values that emerge considering that the gun is mainly law.<br /><br />Disc two is about 'the making of' and a considerable data base of Clint Eastwood movies. Included is an episode from "Maverick" starring James Garner and a very young Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />"Unforgiven" belongs next to "High Noon". It is that good.</p></body></html>

Unlike 'Black Hawk Down', 'We Were Soldiers' brings you inside the war to the people.  You really get to know the soldiers, you really feel for them.  Randall Wallace brilliantly combines the two most important aspects of the Vietnam; the battlefield and the families at home.  Many films try to do this, not many succeed.  Wallace does this by dedicating the first 40+ minutes to the familiarization of the characters and families.  While the battle is raging, Wallace frequently flashes back to the army base where the wives are faced with the difficult task of distributing death notices.<p>Mel Gibson puts forth a brilliant and moving performance as Lt. Colonel Hal Moore.  Gibson masters this role.  We can be sure that his portrayal of Moore is accurate because he worked with the real Hal Moore while filming.  He became Moore, right down to the way he walked!  Madeleine Stowe also puts forth an impressive and emotionally driven performance as Gibson's/Moore's wife, Julie Moore.  I heard that she too worked with the real Julie Moore to help herself master the role.<p>The battle scenes are terrifyingly realistic and haunting.  I've never seen anything like it.  I must mention one particularly haunting scene;<br />The boys are lying in the bush at night with their guns aimed into the darkness before them.  Two terrified soldiers begin to whisper to each other; where's the enemy?  "I can smell them, they're here" proclaims one.  They can't see anything.  It's pitch black.  The soldiers can barely breath.  One whispers into his radio for a flare to be thrown into the woods in front of them so that they might see where their enemy is at.  The flare come, the woods light up.  The silhouettes of the Vietnamese appear.  They are only inches from where they lay.<p>This is only one of the many haunting and unforgettable moments in 'We Were Soldiers'.  It took my breath away.<p>'We Were Soldiers' is such an emotional film!  I found myself sobbing by the time the credits were rolling.  I wasn't the only one, either.  Grown men were crying as well.  We cried for the lost lives and the pain.  We cried for the families and the sacrifices our boys made.  This film really helped me to understand what happened in Vietnam and how it affected the families and those who lived through it.  I honor them.</p></body></html>

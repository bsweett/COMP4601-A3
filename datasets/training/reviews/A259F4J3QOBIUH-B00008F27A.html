<meta name="summary" content="Evil, Undead, Necronomicon...and Bruce Campbell's wise arse."></head><body><p>Back in the day, a roommate brought this home on VHS.  I had always avoided most zombie and Undead flicks, but this one sucked me in.  Bruce Campbell takes himself so seriously, and the action is so wacky that the horrifying Undead creatures are not the main focus.  Sure, I was pinching the seat a bit, but the humorous scenes were relief from the Insane Lovecraftian creatures.<br /><br />The superhero was so smug and sure of himself that he inducted me into Zombie / Undead flicks, and I've always loved this Campy movie.  This is one of those flicks that you can watch again and again.  Also, if you can't get people to watch Undead films, this is a good initiation for your squeamish friends.  I wouldn't start them off with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WC3864">The Evil Dead (Ultimate Edition)</a>.<br /><br />Army of Darkness is one to treasure, and it is always good for laughs amongst fellow geeks.  Bruce Campbell is a superhero for the geeks of the world, even as he gets his arse kicked by Liliputians.</p></body></html>

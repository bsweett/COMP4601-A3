It was filmed on $300,000 budget in the course of three weeks in the Spring of 1978. But in 1981, director Rick Rosenthal, with the help of original HALLOWEEN producers, John Carpenter (director of the first film) & Debra Hill, brought us HALLOWEEN 2.<br /><br />  Filmed in 1981, but picking up on October 31st, 1978, where LAURIE STRODE (again played by Jamie Lee Curtis) has been rescued by DR. SAM LOOMIS (again played by Donald Pleasance), Michael gets up on walks away, for he has not yet finished, nor will he ever be finished, his business in Haddonfield. Laurie is found by the police and ambulance and is taken to safety at the Haddonfield Hospital to be treated for her stab wounds and fractured ankle.<br /><br />  MICHAEL MYERS (played by Dick Warlock) is still at large. He wanders into the Elrod's place, steals a kitchen knife and goes on his way. But his blood left on the cutting board scares the hell out of Mrs. Elrod, causing her to scream in front. ALICE (played by Anne Bruner), The Elrod's next-door neighbor, comes out, concerned, but realizes that it is probably nothing major, but in Alice's case, it is, since Michael appears kills her off.<br /><br />  Earlier, Laurie was taken to the hospital by two paramedics named BUD (played by Leo Rossi) and JIMMY (played by Lance Guest), who is the older brother of one of Laurie's classmates. At the hospital, DR. FREDRICK MIXTER (played by FORD RAINY) requires that she be put under the gas for rest, but Laurie is so terrified that she does not want to sleep, but the Dr. goes against her wishes.<br /><br />  Dr. Loomis has already caught up with SHERIFF LEIGH BRACKETT (again played by Charles Cyphers). They search the whole neighborhood for Michael. They found a supposed Michael Myers. As they chase him, Michael walks into the street, where is he rammed by a police car and slammed into a truck, where he and the truck explodes. The guy in Myers' mask was not Michael Myers. At that moment, DEPUTY HUNT (played by Hunter Von Leer) drives up and tells Brackett about the three kids murdered in Lindsey Wallace's house, and reveals that one of them is Annie, Leigh's daughter, and Laurie's best friend. They pull up, and Brackett looks at his daughter one last time, and storms off, pissed at Loomis for supposedly letting Michael escape, in which, Dr. Loomis hadn't done so. Hunt decides to help Dr. Loomis out in this ordeal.<br /><br />  Awhile later, Jimmy is talking to Laurie about what happened. He reveals that the guy trying to kill her tonight was Michael Myers. She is shocked to learn this, since she has heard about Michael killing his older sister 15 years earlier. She realizes that she last heard that he was locked up, but Jimmy tells Laurie that Michael did escape.<br /><br />  Awhile later, Bud and his girlfriend, KAREN (played by Pamela Susan Shoop), a nurse on the maternity floor, are in the physical therapy tub, but Bud gets out to check the temperature, after Michael had turned up to the hottest temp. There, Michael strangles Bud, but Karen doesn't hear a thing. Michael walks in and drowns Karen in the burning hot water.<br /><br />  Dr. Loomis and Hunt find out that the guy blown up earlier was definitely not Michael, but a 17-year-old boy named, Bennett Tramer. They continue their quest for Michael, until MARION CHAMBERS (again played by Nancy Stephens), the nurse who was with Dr. Loomis last night, arrives to tell him that the governor of Smith's Grove has ordered Loomis back to Smith's Grove. Dr. Loomis and Marion walk out to the car, where a marshal will drive them along. He asks Hunt to continue the search.<br /><br />  At the Hospital, Laurie escapes her hospital room, sending Jimmy and JILL (played by TAWNY MOYER), who is the hospital's receptionist, on the hunt for Laurie. While searching for Laurie, Jimmy finds MRS. ALVES (played by Gloria Gifford), the head nurse, dead. Jimmy trips and cracks his head open.<br /><br />  Jill tries to leave, but can't since every cars' tires are flat. She enters the hospital and finds Laurie walking around, where Laurie witnesses Michael kill Jill. Laurie runs down into the basement, finding the security guard, MR. GARRETT (played by Cliff Emmich) dead. Michael finds her, but Laurie gets on the elevator, leaves the hospital and hides in the car.<br /><br />  Back with Dr. Loomis and Marion, Marion reveals to Dr. Loomis that Laurie Strode is actually, Michael Myers' younger sister. Laurie was born two years before Michael murdered Judith. Two years after his crime, after their parents died, Laurie was adopted by the Strode's. They had requested that this piece of evidence be sealed to protect the family. Dr. Loomis orders the marshal to turn around, in which he does.<br /><br />  Laurie exits the car after seeing Michael again. She runs up to the Hospital door and tries to open it, but it's locked. Dr. Loomis lets her in. He shoots Michael again, but he kills the Marshall and chases Laurie and Loomis, as Marion calls for backup. They enter a gas room, where Laurie shoots Michael's eyes. Dr. Loomis tells Laurie to get out of there, as he turns on gas tanks and blows up the room, burning Michael. Laurie has done it again.<br /><br />  This film is just as scary as the first film and very enjoyable. Jamie Lee Curtis will always be the original Scream Queen. Her screams sound just as great as they did in the original, but I feel as though, hearing scream for the first time in the original will always be the best. This is a worthy follow-up to John Carpenter's original horror masterpiece.</p></body></html>

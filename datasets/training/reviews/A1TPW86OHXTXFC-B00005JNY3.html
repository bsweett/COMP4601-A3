And if you thought, you know, that magic made you sick... you might believe in a magic cure? " so says Caroline Ellis, the young Hospice worker,played by Kate Hudson.<br /><br />Hoodoo (Not Voodoo, it's different. Hoodoo is an old African American magic that only works if you believe in it.) is at play in this southern thriller. Who knew from Voodoo? Caroline Ellis,(Kate Hudson) is a hospice worker who has thought about nursing school and who takes a job as a live-in caretaker in a sinister, decrepit plantation house located deep in the Louisiana Delta. This is a movie that purveys the darkness of the delta within the spectacular views of New Orleans before Katrina.  Brings back memories to all of us. Caroline gradually discovers that nothing is as it first seemed, the old man is being held prisoner against his will, the house is possessed by voodoo spirits, and she  may be trapped by their evil spell.  Gena Rolwands plays Violet Devereaux. She inches her character ever closer to going over the top before reining her back in at the last moment. We believe that she is evil personified. Her husband, Ben Devereaux, is played by John Hurt. He has suffered a stroke and cannot speak or move. He is able to convey via his eyes the menacing horrow that is his, and Caroline Ellis is bound to save him. His acting via his eyes and facial expression is superb. Kate Hudson does a memorable job of playing this role, and her talent for acting is noted. This is a thriller that kept my interest. I was not prepared for the shocking ending, but was not surprised. This is not a movie that would have a so-so ending. This is one of the better thrillers in a while, and is certainly worth your time. The views of New Orleans before the Storm are worth viewing the entire movie and is more that worth your time.<br /><br />This is a movie of characterization, IMO. Each character brings the suspense and moodiness that is needed to sustain the movie.  Gena Rowlands, as always steals the scenes but John Hurt and Kate Hudson more than keep up their end. Voodoo/Hoodoo, all the same, brings the magic to this movie. Do you believe?<br /> Recommended. prisrob 6/27/06</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very, very funny"></head><body><p>A surprise smash hit when released over the summer, The Hangover is probably one of the funniest R-rated slob comedies you'll come across in some time.  With the impending nuptuals of their best friend Doug (Justin Bartha) approaching, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) take him to Vegas for a night he'll never forget.  Trouble is Alan isn't all that bright, and accidentally laces all their drinks with roofies.  When Phil, Stu, and Alan all wake up the next day, there's a tiger in their bathroom, a baby in the closet, Stu's missing a tooth, and Doug is missing.  What develops throughout The Hangover ranges from predictable to absolutely hilarious and back again, and even though it loses steam as it winds down towards its conclusion, this is definitely the funniest film that Todd Phillips has made since Old School.  With cameos and small roles from Heather Graham, Jeffrey Tambor, Mike Epps, and Mike Tyson as himself.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The fallen warrior scenario using a hostage negotiator"></head><body><p>Jeff Talley (Willis) was once a top-flight hostage negotiator in LA.  When a critical hostage negotiation fails, Talley takes the police chief position in Ventura, CA which endangers his marriage and puts strain on the relations with his kid.<br /><br />Inevitably, another crisis erupts with stakes just as high and Talley has to make this one work.  For a thriller, the plot was just a tad too predictable for this viewer.  "Hostage" is enjoyable, but a must only if you are a serious Bruce Willis fan.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, October 2008</p></body></html>

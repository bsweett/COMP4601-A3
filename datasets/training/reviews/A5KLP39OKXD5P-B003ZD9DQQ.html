<meta name="summary" content="The 'Hitler' we hardly knew"></head><body><p>This film really amazed me a lot. Right from the beginning sequence the film grabbed my entire attention and I had my eyes glued to the screen till the last credits. This film is very precise in terms of War, Politics and decent emphasis on Sir Adolf Hitler's persona. The 'Hitler' of whom we had brief flicks in several war documentaries or maybe some films depicting wars, this is a totally different side of the man, have the pleasure to witness Hitler as a plain human being, watch him as he exposes his heart to you in the film, watch him undergo different emotions, the film is a remarkable piece of Biography, a splendid cast following Bruno Ganz as Hitler himself, he is phenomenal and simply breathtaking, a remarkable performance by Alexandra Maria Lara and Juliane Kohler. Definitely worth a watch.</p></body></html>

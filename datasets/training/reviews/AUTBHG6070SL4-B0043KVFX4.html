<meta name="summary" content="Millappeal"></head><body><p>This movie has a few things going for it: shambling virus-ridden zombies, evil corporate types in neckties and English accents, and Milla. Well, maybe just one: Milla.<br /><br />The franchise continues, and the uninfected survivors have dropped to a handful. As you expect, the "uninfected" and "survivor" groups both drop even more through the movie, amid festoons of gore. Also as you expect (or at least hope), the worst of the baddies get theirs in the end. It's not wholly a splatter movie, though: a heavy-handed tribute to Hitchcock appears partway through.<br /><br />The real attraction is Jovovich being the baddest badgirl on the block. Maybe the chilliest, too - someone should give the poor lady a blanket, or at least a camisole. (Come to think of it, Milla in lack of a wardrobe is an attraction, too.) Then, at the last minute, we get some sequel-bait that promises more of Ludmilla in some forthcoming follow-on flick. Lots more of her, lots and lots.<br /><br />Set your expectations low enough, and this movie will rise to them or beyond. It's a movie adaptation of a video game, fer cryin' out loud - what did you expect?<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></body></html>

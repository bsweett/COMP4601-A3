It has been a long time since I've seen a Science Fiction film as ambitious and pumped with adrenaline as this one.  The huge sets and spectacular special effects are glorious, and the cast contains some interesting and highly memorable characters.  Although, this film is certainly not for everyone.  Those who expect perfection will be summarily disappointed; but those who don't mind the occasional flaw as long as the story moves forward at a brisk and entertaining pace should be enthralled.  I love reading epic Sci-fi novels that encompass multi-culture conflicts on a variety of planets host to a multitude of characters whose presence lingers on long after the final page is turned.  That is what has been accomplished here: the ultimate in Space Opera laced with fantastic action sequences and a lead character you just can't take your eyes off of.  There are many film influences apparently "borrowed" for this story, such as "Dune," "Star Trek," "Conan the Barbarian," and even a few excellent ideas practically stolen from the animated film "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within."  The integration of all these sources should collide but they instead merge into an intoxicating brew of dazzling visuals and non-stop action sequences.  There is a scene in this film that I want to relate, in part, due to the fact it reminded me of another great scene from "The Pianist" which won the Oscar for Best Director for Roman Polanski.  In "The Pianist" there is a scene where a tank fires a shell into the vacinity of the main character and explodes; all of a sudden the sound cuts out except for a high-pitched tone and muffled footfalls leaving the viewer with an unprecedented feeling of being in same room.  In "The Chronicles of Riddick" director David Twohy uses a similar idea as an explosion hits and the entire battle is silenced, the score is absent, and all that can be heard is the muffled sound of armored soldiers crashing against the rocks.  It was another remarkable sample taken and seamlessly woven into the framework of this wholly under-rated film.  To get more background information on a couple of the characters in this film, especially Riddick, it is a good idea to check out the film "Pitch Black" first.  Both films are worth owning, this sequel starting up the story five years after "Pitch Black" ends.  This is a thoroughly entertaining film filled with fine action sequences, superb special effects, and an epic tale that spans three planets and all the space between.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

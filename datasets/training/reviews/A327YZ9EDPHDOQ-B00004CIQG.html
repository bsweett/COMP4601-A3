<meta name="summary" content="Peter Sellers at his best!!"></head><body><p>I have been used to Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther movies but this 1964 movie is WONDERFUL! One movie..three different roles. Dr. Strangelove has stood the test of time since its release. If memory serves me correct this movie was originally to be released in late 1963 but was delayed due to the assassination of President Kennedy. George C.Scott did a superb job in his role. The scene in which the President (Peter Sellers) calling his Russian counterpart was hilarious. Worth watching again!!</p></body></html>

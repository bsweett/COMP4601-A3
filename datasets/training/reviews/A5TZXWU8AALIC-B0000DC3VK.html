<meta name="summary" content="Really Wanted to Like This One"></head><body><p>This movie appeared to have everything going for it: a unique idea with a literary background, a terrific cast, top-notch special effects.<br /><br />But it just doesn't work.<br /><br />The machine guns and car chase were distracting for 1899.  Sean Connery always adds weight to any proceedings and Peta Wilson is sexy as a vampire.  I loved the clash of literary characters like Dorian Gray, Jekyll & Hyde, the Invisible Man, etc.  But I ended up wanting to like this movie more than I did.<br /><br />(I'd also heard that Connery has another miserable time making this film, clashing with the young director and such.  So much so that Harrison Ford, when asked if Connery will return as his father in the next Indiana Jones film, tersely says, "He's retired").<br /><br />I'd like to see what the original graphic novels this was based on are like.</p></body></html>

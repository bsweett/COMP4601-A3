<meta name="summary" content="One of my Top Ten of 1998"></head><body><p>American History X takes its place among a handful of films that dare to address difficult subjects without any sugarcoating or watering down. The fact that it failed at the boxoffice is not surprising. In our modern age, what's most important it that it was made and is available for anyone who chooses to see it. <p>It is simply done, yet exquisite in its deliberate use of both black and white and color. The colors show often that the stark contrasts of black and white are often just an illusion. The world is far more complex than black, white and shades of gray can capture.<p>It is the story of an average American boy named Derek [Edward Norton in his Oscar nominated performance] who turns into a neo-Nazi skinhead. How this decision affects the lives of his younger brother Danny [Edward Furlong in his best role] and the rest of his family, not to mention the lives of others around him, is the focus of the movie. Yet it is far more than the story of a bigoted boy gone bad. It deals with the basic nature of racial hatred and plays more like a modern updating of an idea by William Shakespeare than anything else I can think of. <p>If I have any negative opinion of this film, it is that there was not time in it to fully flesh out every thing it addresses. This is a minor complaint, and is far better than films that go on and on about a thing long after we've gotten the point. <p>Edward Norton truly deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Actor. I never though I'd see the day when Robert DiNero would have a competitor, but if it isn't Norton, then it isn't anyone. <p>Every part of this movie rang true to me - the simple, middle-class family struggling to survive, the love between brothers, the scenes in prison. Even the somewhat cruel ending makes perfect sense if you stop and really think about the beginning of the movie.<p>Anne Dudley contributed here one of the finest music scores for a movie in 1998.</p></body></html>

Usually I find when films are shot in the desert the plot gets old and boring (ex. Hidalgo) but not this film.  This has a little Indiana Jones and a little bit of Alien mixed in.  It is a really good popcorn movie.  One thing I have to say is that I think they could've got a better actor for the lead role instead of Brenden Frazier.  The british girl played a good role.  The special effects were awesome and the story really grabs you.  See this or rent it.  I highly reccomend it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Takes us into the wild but never really takes us into the man..."></head><body><p>One thing that can't be overstated about Sean Penn's `Into the Wild' is that it truly is a breathtaking cinematic experience.  The films vivid scenes are beautiful to watch and come alive in the viewer.  There are moments of such crisp realism that we feel we are right alongside McCandless in his journeys.  The Alaskan countryside is flawlessly depicted (although pictures never do anything justice...I've been there and I can honestly say it is the most beautiful place on mother earth...`Into the Wild' comes very close to capturing it though).  The action sequences are masterfully edited to where we feel one with them, like we are in that canoe or on that train or crossing that creek.<br /><br />Sadly though, what is visually breathtaking is no so much emotionally breathtaking.  By the close of the film we don't feel as though we really understand the man that is Christopher McCandless.  We come to know Alexander Supertramp but McCandless is a mystery.  Maybe this is because McCandless never truly found himself, but as the film draws to a close and we are supposed to feel the revelations this man is finally realizing I have to cry wolf.  As McCandless scribbles into his journal that he feels scarred and lonely I found myself scratching my head, because I never got that from him.  The film paints McCandless as one thing and one thing only; self absorbed.  He runs from human interaction and thrives on being one with nature.  That is all fine in itself but as the running time starts to give way to credits Penn tries desperately to prove McCandless has seen the folly in his ways and come to realize he needs human interaction to survive.  I guess maybe he attempts this too late in the film and only give the audience a good five minutes to embrace this concept.<br /><br />It doesn't quite work.<br /><br />The film follows the two-year journey of Christopher McCandless as he picks up after graduating college and sets off on an adventure of a lifetime.  He donates his entire saving to charity, burns whatever money he has left and hitches his way across the continent with nothing really but the clothes on his back and a few awkward supplies.  He sets his sights on Alaska, but he's not opposed to a few stops along the way.  From Colorado to Mexico and just about everywhere in between McCandless meets many people that supposedly shape the outcome of his outlook on life.  McCandless grew up in a house filled with yelling and fighting and threatened divorce.  Not that that doesn't take place in 75% of all homes in America but regardless, this is what he was up against.  Feeling as though he had no family he decided to leave everything behind and find himself.  What he found, or so we're told, was loneliness and fear; but of course that came after all the fun and excitement.<br /><br />Whatever must be said for the portrayal of McCandless it has nothing to do with the performance given by Emile Hirsch.  I am not usually moved or even impressed with this young man but this has to be his finest performance to date (the fact that he does all of his own stunts and loses Christian Bale amounts of weight here shows great dedication and also plays in his favor).  He seems to understand the selfishness that lives within his character and he exudes it in a very subtle way, one that could be justified by some as free-spirited but is without doubt selfish dependence.  The only place in which his performance falters is when he is asked to portray an ounce of regret as the film closes, but again I feel that is not his fault as much as it is the fault of the unfair time restraint placed on him by Penn.<br /><br />The entire cast rises to the challenge in this film, and while much of the film revolves around McCandless in his solidarity there is much to be said for actors who can do so much with so little.  Harden and Hurt may not be seen much if not within flashbacks, but they each have their own scenes of splendid bliss (the scene where Hurt collapses in the street broke my heart).  Jena Malone is poorly underused (I just love her) but makes an impression as Christopher's sister Carine.  I've never seen her look so beautiful, that's for sure.  Vince Vaughn seems a little out of place for me here but he manages to deliver well, and Kristen Stewart is just delightful as Tracy.  I remember watching her in `In the Land of Women' and thinking that she had much to offer if it were only tapped a little better and here she proves that that tapping is well underway.  Catherine Keener develops a beautiful character in Jan and Brian Dierker works off of his co-stars wonderfully as Rainey.<br /><br />Above all else, Hirsch included, is the magnificent Hal Holbrook.  His beautiful and touching portrayal of Ron Franz, the old man who takes Chris under his wing, is the most memorable supporting character in the film.  What Ron does with his small screen time (roughly fifteen minutes, give or take) is really more than anyone else does here.  His final scene with Hirsch is so moving, so touching and ultimately so heartbreaking.  I'm almost moved to tears just recalling it now.<br /><br />As a whole I think that `Into the Wild' is a well done film, it just misses the biggest mark it sets out to make; and that is of making McCandless a real person.  I have a few issues with some of the decisions made production wise with the film (like the horrible yellow writing that scribbles across the screen...which makes the film appear kind of cheap in a way) but they are not enough to knock stars off for.  No, the only reason this film does not receive a five star rating from me is the mere fact that the final five minutes or so try and paint Chris as a changed man, and five minutes is not long enough to convince me of that.  Had Penn given Hirsch a good twenty minutes to nurse the idea then maybe it would have been convincing, but sadly it was not.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Lot of Stir"></head><body><p>"Atonement" has pleasant moments.  I didn't enjoy it very much, but I think it probably is good.  Saoirse Ronan who was Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actress as the young Briony Tallis does an excellent job of creating a lot of stir.  Ramola Garai takes over as Briony at age 18 and does a good job of trying to atone for her actions as a young girl.  Vanessa Redgrave is excellent, albeit in a thankless role, as Briony right before her death.  Redgrave has been nominated for Oscars for "Morgan!" (1966), "Isadora" (1968), "Mary Queen of Scots" (1971), "The Bostonians" (1984), and "Howard's End" (1992).  She won a supporting Oscar in 1977 for "Julia."  I have been watching her captivating performance in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V6LSOA">Evening</a>.  As the aging author telling this tale, she is reduced to a TV interview show format.  Keira Knightly who was nominated for an Oscar for "Pride & Prejudice" in 2005 looks good.  James McAvoy, who plays Robbie Turner, was nominated by the British Academy Awards & the Golden Globes for this film.  He had previously been nominated for an Oscar in the powerful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJF4">The Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  He's always very good in his films; however "Atonement" keeps him rather boxed in emotionally, despite the excellent scenes in the war.  Brenda Blethyn plays his mother Grace Turner in a nice cameo.  The best performance of the film for me was in the cameo of Jeremie Renier as Luc Cornet, a French soldier who dies from a scull injury in front of Briony.  It's a short but powerful performance.  Belgian Renier was nominated as Best Actor by the European Film Awards for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G0O5IM">L' enfant</a> (The Child) in which he sells his baby.  In "Atonement," he is touching with his mind going between memory and the present.<br /><br />My greatest disappointment with "Atonement" was the screenplay which tries to be clever by jumping back and forth with flashbacks and giving us only part of the story to be unhooked at the director's discretion.  Thus, rather than just telling a fairly interesting tale, we must wonder at how clever the screenwriter was.  It doesn't work and the final scenes like the flooded tunnel come as downer footnotes.  If depressing cinema is your forte, get your hanky for this one.  The performances and cinematography, however, are exquisite.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

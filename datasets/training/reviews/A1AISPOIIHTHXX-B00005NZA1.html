How can James Cameron top Titanic, which is still the top money-making movie ever(not counting old movies and inflation). And George Lucas will pretty much be that Star Wars dude. Upstart director M Night Shyamalan came out with The Sixth Sense, an intriguing thriller with one of the best and well-known twist endings in existence. So how do you follow it up? Make something similar.<br /><br />A train derails and causes a huge disaster killing everyone. That is except for one: David Dunn, a security guard working at a stadium. The kicker is: not only did he survive but he didn't even get scratched, hurt, a headache or anything. This attracts the interest of a comic book enthusiast Elijah Price who gets David's attention by asking a simple question: how many times have you been sick? Turns out David can't and he can potentially be what Elijah's been looking for: a real-life comic book hero.<br /><br />The trailer was probably the most interesting thing about the film. Someone stumbles upon an immunity to pain and injury and we're trying to figure out how he does it. It comes out and it mentions comic books. Like subsequent films The Village and Lady in the Water, Unbreakable was an intriguing premise until it steers off in other directions. What is here though is intriguing regardless. I always was fascinated by mythology and special abilities that comic books can bring so of course, me and my nerdness gravitated towards this. The only thing is that it might be unintentionally funny. When David is told that something is like his kryptonite it's kind of like "oh, boy".<br /><br />The one thing that makes this different is that unlike the others which had character moments interspersed with full-on thriller scenes, this gears into more drama and character stuff. For some, it's a great change of pace rather than relying on scary stuff and spooks but for others it's kind of tedious and slow. The one thing that irks me though is that there's a bit too much flashyness with the camera. The camera is upside-down, reflected in mirrors, shot through that sliver of space in seats. Now granted Shyamalan is one of the few that knows where to put his camera but at times it's like "quit showing off, man".<br /><br />Performances-wise it's good all around. Bruce still talks in that kind of I-sound-super-bored voice that he always has and Robin and Spencer are good in their respective roles, a highlight scene being a little confrontation at the dinner table. Samuel L. Jackson comes in and of course acts awesome but with a haircut like a run-in with an angry blow-dryer and full pimpness complete with cane, it comes a bit close to campy. You can almost imagine characters to go "smack!" or "zop!" when someone gets punched.<br /><br />In terms of where his films stand, this is either everybody's least favorite(or the Village) or it's underrated and we just don't get it. I'm more in the middle. It's a good film, not great.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Beware of this show cause it's really addicting"></head><body><p>Funny how the opening credits perfectly sums up the feeling of the show. The word "Lost" appears among a black background out of focus coming closer to camera, then it goes clear for 2 seconds than goes blurry again before disappearing. Exactly like the show: plot points and answers are revealed only to have them not appear like they are and it's gone. Like trying to finding a really fast cat.<br /><br />A man wakes up in the jungle disoriented. While going through the jungle and reaching the coastline he sees a certainly eye-opening sight: the flight he was on as crashed and debris among with survivors are on the beach. This has to be the best scene in the entire series, it's suspensful and gripping, especially the um, turbine part. Then the pilot continues with the series next 2 best scenes: the hearing of something ominous in the jungle and an "attack" on the front end of the plane.<br /><br />After that, things don't really get as gripping, except for a little phantom passenger but other than that, nothing really sinks its claws in like those opening 2 pilot episodes(including the transmission scene, btw recommendation: don't read the booklet with the episode sypnosis, they're not the most discreet about certain things.) What does compel you though is the answers to those questions which oddly just literally hang for episodes on end.<br /><br />With such a huge survivor list you would think we'd lose perspective on how many people they are but you notice that there's just enough although 48 survivors is kind of pushing it. We'd all develop our favorites too, and that might change since every episode one character tends to have their own flashback episode where something about their life is revealed. So some survivors you probably wouldn't like but end up liking them anyway. One of my favorites is Sawyer: funny, brash and quite complicated. And I can identify with Charlie, always wants to help but never seems to have it appreciated, even when he needs the help as well.<br /><br />If they're could be one complaint is that the show almost seems like buckling under its own weight. Like loading a table with boxes, the more you put on the more it'll crack and break. So it seems with the show: with so many questions and very few answers being given, you're not really sure how the writers will pull off the ending without it being like "oh come on, as if!"<br /><br />The packaging is odd too. 2 discs come stacked with one on the other rather than separate parts. But it's still a great set and incredibly interesting.</p></body></html>

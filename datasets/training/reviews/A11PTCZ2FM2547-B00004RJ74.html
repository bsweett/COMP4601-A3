<meta name="summary" content="Meat Grinder Fun"></head><body><p>The best horror/slasher flicks are the ones that never, ever, take themselves seriously--super slimy grimy vegamatic over-the-tops with satirical tongues planted firmly in cheeks (though in which anatomical cheek it's unclear).  FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is one of these awful gems; it's nonsensical and silly and gruesome and bad and as much darn fun as one can ever hope to have watching a cut-'em-up (plus in this case, bite-'em-up).  In fact, after the first uber-violent, utterly ridiculous bloodletting orgy I jumped from my couch to give FROM DUSK TILL DAWN a standing ovation.  Now that's entertainment.<br /><br />Made in the mid-Nineties before anyone knew who the hey George Clooney was (or is) and directed by Robert Rodriguez with screenplay by Quentin Tarantino (who also stars as Clooney's warped brother), this is one bad flick about two violent robbers who kidnap a family and flee to Mexico to seek refuge at some hole-in-the-wall off-road bar. . .a bar offering anything but refuge.  Needless to say as dusk ensues the vamps come out of the woodwork while the violence is sloshed by the bucketful as mayhem spins madly with the occasional clever zany quip.  Other performers I particularly enjoyed include Fred "The Hammer" Williamson, Tom Savani (when he tries to hide his "changing" into a vampire from his fellow companions I was rolling on the floor), a surprisingly subdued Harvey Keitel, and Cheech Marin (in multiple roles).  But nothing--and I mean NOTHING--compares to a heart-thumping striptease performed by a gorgeous, stunning Salma Hayek; it's visual Viagra that's instant money, and it's yet another reason why FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is nonstop, goofy fun.<br />--D.

<meta name="summary" content="A classic monster of a comedy"></head><body><p>I first saw this (twice) in high school (yes, you heard right). Shown after classes, it remained uncut in all its risque, irreverent glory. I immediately fell in love with this comedy. And I'm still in love with it. If any film deserves to be called a "classic", it's this one. Not only did writer-director Mel Brooks & writer-star Gene Wilder capture the visual black & white beauty of the old horror classics, but they pulled off the impossible--a kooky, irreverent comedy that's also a sweet, loving tribute to those films. Every single joke & sight gag hits the bullseye, and each & every performance is memorable (made bittersweet by the passing of Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn & Peter Boyle over the years). There are so many great comedy bits crammed into this movie that it's almost futile to make a list here, so I'll spare you the reading.<br />A definite must for any Brooks movie collection. Long live "Young Frankenstein!"</p></body></html>

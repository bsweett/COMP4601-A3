However things are not what they appear to be which is the first thing you younger people reading this will  learn in Sociology 101 when you get to College. It seems like everybody in this movie has a secret including Amaanda Peet, John Cusack , Ray Liotta and even the Motel owner is hiding something.The body count soon rises  as the secrets are revealed. This is a very original and highly entertaining movie which has a lot of twists and unexpected turns in it's plot. A great movie and a Stellar cast!!!</p></body></html>

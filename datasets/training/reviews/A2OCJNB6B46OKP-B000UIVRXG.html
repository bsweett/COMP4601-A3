'Hot Fuzz' is the newest release from the comedy team that brought you 'Shawn of the Dead' one of the most origional plays on the cliche horror movie. This time the world of action packed crime fighting cops is placed in the hand of these comic geniuses. There are so many things in this movie that made it probably one of the most entertaining movies I have seen since '300'. One I just love British movies. Two all the hysterical dialogue even during the most tense moments in the movie that just make you snicker even though you know you shouldn't be. Three, the final chapter in the movie that takes almost every cliche moment from your tradition action movie and twists them in so many ways you will wet your pants from laughing so hard. If you haven't been to the movies in a while this will be your final excuse to go before Spider-Man 3 and the other much awaited Summer blockbusters move into theaters</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great cast, so-so plot."></head><body><p>Shutter Island directed by Martin Scorsese is a very ambitious film but kind of boring as well. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Michelle Williams, and Ben Kingsley round out the talented cast but even their acting chops can't save this psychological film from barely staying above float. The film doesn't really get interesting until the last 45 minutes - very disturbing and hard to watch but that's the only section of this film that grabbed my attention. So-so thriller, a mixed bag for me.</p></body></html>

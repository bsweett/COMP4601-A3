<meta name="summary" content="DEATH COMES CALLING"></head><body><p>FINAL DESTINATION is an imaginative, and thought-provoking film, a refreshing change of pace from the usual slasher films.  The movie has an incredibly ominous feel throughout and sets a mood that is sustained throughout the film.<p>Although some of the elaborately staged deaths are a bit overblown, they nonetheless are frightening and disturbing.  The scene in the beginning when the plane actually DOES blow up has an apocalyptic feel to it.  We saw what happened in Alex's pre-flight premonition, so that when the only thing we see is the plane exploding, it packs a pretty big wallop.<p>Devon Sawa does a commendable job as the accursed Alex, and Ari Lester is appropriately heroic as soulmate Claire.  It's one of the few teen movies where the actors actually looked and behaved like teens!  One death in particular, involving blonde Terry, comes out of nowhere so fast, we actually gasped when it happened.  It's been a long time since a horror movie has done that!<p>All in all, with its few flaws considered, it is a refreshing look at how death always wins.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="INTERESTING TAKE-OFF ON "THE GRADUATE""></head><body><p>A fairly amusing Jennifer Anniston vehicle, RUMOR HAS IT...stays afloat thanks to some excellent performances from the cast (particularly Shirley Maclaine and Kevin Costner) and the script's dextrous realization of some very complex characters and their multi-layered interractions with one another. Anniston is attractive and mostly likeable as the easily confused protagonist, and Mark Ruffalo is highly convincing as her dissed fiance'. Nowhere nearly as good as THE GRADUATE (from which RUMOR HAS IT...takes its cue) but it is almost possible to see these people playing out that classic's comedy-drama for themselves.  And even though it's directed by Rob Reiner, at least he has enough sense to keep his personal politics out of the plot.  Unless you're a big fan of some of the cast I wouldn't really recommend buying this one, but it might make a good date movie or a cute but harmless rental.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The price of perfection"></head><body><p>"Black Swan" is a fantastic psychological thriller that chronicles one determined ballerina, Nina (Natalie Portman), as she rises to the top of her craft, landing the roles of the White Swan and the Black Swan in her company's production of "Swan Lake." Nina has a hard time letting loose and finding the passion needed to portray the Black Swan. The stress of the production leads her to experience physical ailments, engage in wicked banter with her mother (Barbara Hershey), and become paranoid about a perceived rivalry with a new dancer (Mila Kunis). This is a terrifying movie, far scarier than most horror movies that have emerged in the last decade. Portman's performance is astonishing and all but guarantees her an Oscar nod. The final dance sequence in the film is unbelievable, and I literally got chills at the end of the movie, which never happens. Definitely splurge to see "Black Swan" in the theatre...it's destined to become a classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Genuinely Creepy Story of Brainwashing"></head><body><p>Make no mistake: this movie is about brainwashing. The word "candidate" in the title may make you think it is about politics, and it is, but mostly it is about brainwashing. That the two go together is something the innocent audiences of 1962 found shocking.<br /><br />It is almost impossible to tell you very much about the movie without destroying the complex and subtle plot line, but the basic idea is that the candidate was a hero in the Korean war who spent some significant time in enemy hands. It's not going to ruin it for you to tell you that he was brainwashed by the North Koreans, but the details of the technique make a significant part of the movie, and a significant part of the shock. Angela Lansbury plays the candidate's toxic mother to perfection. Shades of incestuous desire are treated with sufficient subtlety that they got by the censorious early 60s movie review boards. (This was before the days of the rating system, when movies could be killed off altogether if they offended the wrong people.)<br /><br />It's a tight drama with enough plot twists to keep you guessing, no matter how cynical and worldly-wise you are. Keep your eye on the playing cards.</p></body></html>

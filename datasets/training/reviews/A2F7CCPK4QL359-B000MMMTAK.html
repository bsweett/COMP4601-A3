<meta name="summary" content="Borat"></head><body><p>Sacha Baron Chen created Boray for the Ali G for HBO, I was intrigued for Borat, Kazakhstan representive.<br /><br />In watching this movie, I laughed at Borat the film. It was a film outta water ideal taken to the max<br /><br />My favorite scene in the movie is where Borat goes to the antique shop. he said "why you charging so much for old stuff?" Then ACCIDENTLY knock over a rack of dishes..and says "oops, sorry"<br /><br />I do hope  Borat wins the OSCAR for adapted screen play...It is worth it. NOTE, This movie is not for kids, but it is a funny docu-comedy.<br /><br /> Borat, when can we see you again?<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD</p></body></html>

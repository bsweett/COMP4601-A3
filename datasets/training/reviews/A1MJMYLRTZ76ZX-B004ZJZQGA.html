<meta name="summary" content="Quirky, dark satire"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this movie and thought it was excellent, although it's not without its flaws. But then, how many movies are perfect? I didn't mind the violence some have objected to or the frequent use of the "f" word; after all, as someone pointed out, these are hit men and not choir boys. If that sort of profanity offends you then you probably need to stick to "I Love Lucy" and "Nancy Drew" reruns.<br /><br />I found the movie quirky, funny, and even clever--perhaps a bit too self-consciousnessly clever in its attempt to knit so many diverse story threads into one cloth. The movie occasionally gets bogged down as a result in some side stories that could have been omitted, but I didn't mind that. There's enough entertainment between the quirky cast of oddball characters (which, besides the two hit men, include a racist dwarf), the fine acting by the two leads, the beautiful setting of Bruges (which I've visited and can vouch for as to its beauty), and the semi-demented dialog, that you're usually not bored.<br /><br />The story line has been told so many times that I won't reprise it here, except to say that although the two hit men characters have been compared to the famous Travolta and Jackson duo in "Pulp Fiction," in fact they couldn't be more different. In contrast to the super cool, slick hit guys in that movie, these are a couple of quirky, neurotic, bumbling, sort of lovable thugs with enough weighty existential angst for a post-modern novel. The one similarity is the verbose dialog between the two main characters.<br /><br />The movie is a bit schizoid in that the last half gets ever more surrealistic and fantastic, especially in regard to the final scene, whose outcome as shown is very unlikely (I won't say anymore so as not to provide any spoilers). But then, I saw the movie as a purely entertaining dark satire about two hit men whose lives go completely to sh_t in a matter of minutes during a botched job and then are left flapping trying to pick up the pieces, rather than a realistic portrayal of how such a situation would probably turn out.<br /><br />The negative reviews here often panned the movie because of its lack of realism; but, and I could be wrong, I think the movie is really a more than competent satire and send up of what has come to be called the "hit man comedy." If you keep that in mind and don't take it too seriously you might enjoy the movie's many strengths and not get too bent about its flaws, which aren't that serious and can be overlooked since the rest of the movie is strong.</p></body></html>

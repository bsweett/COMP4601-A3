<meta name="summary" content="Brosnan is fantastic as Julian Noble, a hitman who is losing his trigger finger"></head><body><p>Pierce Brosnan (Mrs. Doubtfire, GoldenEye) plays hitman Julian Noble who has seriously lost his edge on killing people. While in Mexico City he meets Danny, played by Greg Kinnear (Auto Focus, Nurse Betty) and the two of them have a conversation that night. Kinnear asks Brosnan what he does and Brosnan tells him he's a hitman but Kinnear doesnt believe him, so Brosnan shows him some things and this convinces Kinnear that he is. Years later, Kinnear and his wife, played by Hope Davis (The Weatherman, American Splendor) get a surprising guest, Julian who shows up and tells Danny that someone has put out a hit on his life because Noble didnt kill who he was supposed to. Brosnan is fantastic in this and Kinnear is always good as usual. This gets Brosnan out of the pits that were Die Another Day and After The Sunset. It turns from comedy into serious towards the end when Brosnan has his mental breakdown and he cant pull the trigger but it still is a great movie. Some funny dialouge as well. Also starring Philip Baker Hall (Boogie Nights, Rush Hour), Dylan Baker (Changing Lanes, Thirteen Days) and Adam Scott (The Aviator, Hellraiser: Bloodline)</p></body></html>

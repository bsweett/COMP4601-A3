Sequels that are held off this long (12 years) are rarely worth it, and the third movie is usually where these franchises start coming undone. Thankfully, within the first five minutes, all of my fears were put to rest. James Cameron is missing-in-action as director, and at the helm this time is the relatively unknown Jonathan Mostow, who injects his own flavor into the science-fiction/action genre and breathes new life into the franchise, while staying true to the roots. This movie is simply amazing. I would even use the word 'epic' to describe it. If you are familiar with the first two 'Terminator' flicks, you will be salivating at most of the scenes. There are also worries about characters that are missing and casting changes, but those should be put to rest as well. This movie benefits from starting from scratch again with it's characters and giving us new problems. I wasn't about ready to watch Linda Hamilton discipline Edward Furlong again for another 2 hours. The movie follows John Connor, now a young adult, who is homeless and as he puts it "lives off the grid." He thinks that he has prevented Judgment Day, but in his heart, he feels it is just yet to come. Sarah Connor, his mother, has passed away, and he is on his own. Not fifteen minutes into the movie, John discovers that there is a new batch of Terminators sent to his time yet again, one, is the loveable Arnie model, sent to protect him. The other is the unstoppable T-X (a.k.a The Terminatrix) who is an improved model over the T-1000 from part 2 and is, well, female. The movie moves at a non-stop pace. This movie gave me the adrenaline rush that 'The Matrix: Reloaded' needed, promised, and lacked. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire hour and fifty minutes this movie lasted. The story sucks you in, as it is revealed that Judgment Day is quickly coming up on the horizon and there may be nothing John or his allies can do to stop it. The whole movie has an underlying feeling of doom. Because Judgment Day is inevitable, and no matter what he does, the walls will come crashing down around John Connor. I have to say that I had a massive grin on my face when the machines started taking over. We have been hearing about it all for so long, it was amazing to finally see it happen. And it was all pulled off so well. This movie takes a lot of risks that most summer-blockbusters don't take. For one thing, it stays true to its roots and is a real fan-pleaser. Instead of providing a story that any newcomer can follow, this installment is a continuation of previous events and helps put all the pieces of the puzzle back together. Also, the movie is relatively violent, bleak and sprinkled with a bit of dark humor. It all works maginificently. I can't hand this movie enough compliments. All I can say to you is, put your fears aside. You can waste your time wondering what this movie would be like had Cameron directed it, but as it is, Jonathan Mostow contributed an exciting and fresh sequel to the franchise, that, tastefully enough, leaves room for more. Let's just hope T4 makes it here before the summer of 2015.</p></body></html>

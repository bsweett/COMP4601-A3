I could never guess what's happening next, especially the ending.<br /><br />If you like a different story with unexpected turns. This is a MUST-SEE.<br /><br />The ony trouble is after you watch it once, the second time is not as suspenseful any more because you already know what's happening.<br /><br />No wonder it got 2 Ocars in 1996. One was given to  Christopher McQuarrie for best screenplay. The other was given to Kevin Spacey for best supporing actor.</p></body></html>

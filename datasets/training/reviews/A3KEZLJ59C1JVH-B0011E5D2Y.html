Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn play John and Jeremy, best friends who crash weddings for fun in an attempt to get vulnerable girls into bed with them. All goes well until they attend the wedding of the daughter of the Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken). Jeremy unknowingly deflowers the Secretary's virginal/sex maniac daughter (Isla Fisher), while poor John falls in love with the Secretary's other daughter (Rachel McAdams), who unfortunately has an asinine boyfriend (Bradley Cooper). The film does lose a bit of momentum halfway through, but it still contains plenty of laughs. It was a little strange watching Wilson play the straight man for once, but he did an excellent job in his role. Vaughn is the real star of the show, though: His one-liners are hilarious, and the Jeremy/Gloria scenes made me laugh so hard that I cried. "Wedding Crashers" is a very funny film that is definitely worth watching.</p></body></html>

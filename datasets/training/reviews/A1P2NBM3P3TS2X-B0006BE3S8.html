The rest of the elements are copies of other crappy films.  That about sums it up.<br /><br />Films like this don't have to be necessarily plausible, but they should be plausible within the context of the suspended disbelief we are asked to come to the theatre with.  This film again fails miserably.<br /><br />Worst part?  The script.  It is just plain LAZY.  Lame dialogue executed by bored or undertalented actors.  You know INSTANTLY which characters will die because they either don't have names or they talk about how much they miss their kids.  In B-movie land, that is the kiss of death.  Lead actress Sanaa Lathan reads each line the same, and her acting range runs the gamut from A to, well, B.  Not entirely her fault, though.  Any moviegoer with any sense of narrative sense knows that the script and dialogue are weak, weak, weak.<br /><br />Watch the movie and see how many moments or ideas you see that are stolen directly from other films:<br /><br />"Armageddon" and "The X-Files movie" are the primary theft victims.<br /><br />20th Century Fox had YEARS to develop a decent screenplay and hire a decent director.  Apparently they chose to do neither.<br /><br />I don't recommend this movie to anyone.  If you are just super gung-ho on seeing it just out of loyalty, a sense of completion, or morbid curiosity, then go ahead.<br /><br />But you'll be sorry.<br /><br />Okay, a couple of specifics so I don't just sound like I'm ranting for the sake of ranting:<br /> --The team of "experts" called in from across the globe to investigate..... wow, that's original.  And all of them are young and good looking (at least the central characters).  One of these experts can even decipher within moments, with stunning confidence and ease, an ancient heiroglyphic language that is a hybrid of three ancient cultures.  Good job, buddy.<br /><br />---The sick, aging billionaire who appears at the top of the stairs and, with no prior introduction to the audience or the characters, launches into his fantastic story about how and why the "dream team" was assembled.  This is an oft-overused cliched movie moment, ain't it?  Answer - yes.<br /><br />-- To hide the fact that it is too difficult to make fight scenes between the Aliens and the Predators look realistic, they shoot the scenes in extreme close-up and with rapid-fire editing so you never really get any kind of sense of space or size.  You just see 1/2 second glimpses of fists flying, weapons firing, and acid dripping.<br /><br />-- The alien ship carrying the Predators comes closer to the Earth than the Moon is, launches a cutting beam and 3 Predator-carrying pods to the surface, and apparently no space agency or defense agency takes notice.  Just like "Independence Day" - remember how those big ships got so close to the Moon that Neil Armstrong's footprint in the dirt was vibrated into oblivion, and ONLY THEN did some lone yahoo at a super-high-tech observatory notice something?  I mean C'MON!  We can spot planets and asteroids hundreds of millions of miles away, but we can't spot alien ships until they are as close as the Moon?<br />That is simply another example of lazy, grade-school B-movie screenwriting.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but you should get the drift by now.  I'm not claiming that "Alien" or "Predator" were based on actual events and thus beyond criticism for their liberties with plausibility.  But those two movies at least kept their foundation in CONTEXTUAL plausibility.<br /><br />This "AVP" movie exists solely for the sake of pleasing the undemanding fan who just wants to see an Alien fight a Predator under any cirumstances filmable.<br /><br />We deserved a better effort from the filmmakers and the studio.</p></body></html>

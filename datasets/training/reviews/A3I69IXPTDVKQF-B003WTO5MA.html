<meta name="summary" content="Gripping Horror Remake Done Right, With A Fresh Spin On A Classic Story"></head><body><p>One of the latest in a series of remakes of horror movies that didn't need to be remade but managed to hit the bullseye anyway, the new "Amityville Horror" does what a remake must do to be a success: it stays true to the concept and the esscence of the original; but it differentiates itself enough to stand on its own - playing up angles that got less attention the first time around while spending less time on what already got the lion's share of the thrust the first time around, adding in some new elements, maybe taking a left where the original took a right, that kind of thing.  If a remake is too out there it gets to the point where it shouldn't have been a remake at all, it should have been its own original entry, and may actually end up hamstrung by trying to make what seemingly wanted to be an entirely new movie a remake of something else in the first place.  On the other hand, if it's just a shot-for-shot and word-for-word clone, I see very little point in it.<br /><br />  2005's "Amityvile Horror" is a faster-paced (although not nearly so breakneck a pace as early reports seemed to indicate), somewhat gorier version of the tale in which you actually see more of the horrors than in the classic 1979 original.  Excellent choice for a way to go; the much slower, 'crawling dread' type of feel that relied on hints, imagination and very occasional but highly effective jolts was done brilliantly the first time around, and going for a diiferent vibe on the same story was far preferable, in my mind, to mirroring the original too closely.  That's why the recent crop of horror remakes is turning out so well - we're getting a new, very distinct variation on a story instead of the exact same tone over again but with different performers.  And the characterization and the coherency of the movie remain in great form with the new, more action-oriented, visually direct feel.<br /><br />  Highly believable, universally great performances, an added air of sexiness and occasional well-placed humor, neither of which clash with the movie's overall dark and intense feel, and realistic special effects, plus a major new original element in the movie's latter stages, make this a major winner.  I hope it's followed up by a sequel or two; the original movies went in a totally different direction from Part II onwards than the original books and the events that reportedly occurred in the Amityville house.<br /><br />Overall, a great movie of an innocent and likable family unexpectedly finding themselves in the midst of a hideous force of malevolence.  As highly recommended as the original.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="With Many Losses, Probably the Best They Could Do."></head><body><p>Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, I didn't much like 1. (2 stars) I thought 2 was A LOT BETTER. (4.5 stars) And I thought 3 was better still. (5 stars)<br /><br />I would have been happy to 3 end the saga. But I suppose a mediocre 4th film is better than none at all.<br /><br />Depp and Mr. Gibbs find themselves on the run again, and are captured and forced into the service of King George II. Rush seems to have found his way into a safer job in the service of King George II. (For the record, King George II was the last king to lead troops into battle, and was known for his bravery.)<br /><br />To make a long story short, Depp escapes, but Gibbs is caught and Rush forces Gibbs into his service to find the fountain of youth. And later, Depp is forced into the service of Black Beard to find the fountain of youth as well.<br /><br />Ian McShane as Black Beard had a very difficult (if not impossible) hand dealt to him. This film is dealing with the loss of Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightley, Pintel, Rhagetti, James Norrington, Tia Dalma, and Davy Jones. McShane had the difficult task of  filling the shoes of Davy Jones. But in all honesty, he really did the best he could with the bad hand he was dealt. It is interesting that he played Judas Iscariot in "Jesus of Nazareth" (1977). This gives a real chilling irony when he talks to the young and untainted religious man: "Do you want to know when I think of God? When I see suffering, pain, and anguish." Also when he comments on how some souls are doomed and don't have the luxury of choosing their fate. This is an irony only someone who had played Judas Iscariot could have given. As someone who remembers him as Judas Iscariot (and thus having been close to Jesus and exposed to his teachings), one moment I found especially powerful in a dark way was when he told the young and untainted religious man: "Well, here's the chance to prove the worth and powers of your prayers. Pray that he may be delivered from...evil?"<br /><br />You'll probably notice that the film drags more than 2 or 3. It does appear at times they were trying to make Rush evil again. But it really doesn't work to do that. Once a villain makes it to a 3d gray character, you really can't push him back to a 2d villain.<br /><br />Cruz is an interesting character in that she appears to be a villain, but we are allowed sympathy for her in that she was an almost nun who Depp corrupted. And she does love her father. Funny that she plays a former almost nun, and the actor who is her father had played Judas Iscariot. I should probably add that he played Judas in the most tragic and sympathetic way possible.<br /><br />The final fight lacks the fun energy of 2 and 3. But it's decent all things considered. There are some Shakespeare techniques as well. Like Laertes, Rush kills with a poisoned sword. (from "Hamlet")  Cruz's final pleas to Depp are not unlike Joan of Arc's final pleas in (1 "Henry VI"). And Black Beard has a Macbeth moment when he knows he will probably lose, but bravely fights.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed it better than 1. But not as much as 2 or 3.<br /><br />But it was nice to see Depp, Gibbs, and Rush again. And I do applaud Ian McShane for doing the best he could with a difficult hand. He provided an irony only someone who had played Judas Iscariot could have.<br /><br />If you're a major POC fan, you will of course want to add this to your collection. If you're only a so so fan, I suggest you borrow it before you buy.</p></body></html>

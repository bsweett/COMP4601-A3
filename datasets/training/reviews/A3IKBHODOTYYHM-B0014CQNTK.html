<meta name="summary" content="Tries to be too hip, nothing exceptional"></head><body><p>Juno is a film which tackles the issue of teenage pregnancy. Once teenager Juno discovers she is pregnant, she immediately tries to figure out what to do. Does she try to have an abortion, or does she keep it? Or does she give it up for adoption? The story revolves about her emotions in dealing with her pregnancy and bringing a life into the world. She tells her best friends, and seeks advice, and once she decides to give it away for adoption, meets the couple and tries to figure out if they will be the right parents for her child. While the film has heart at times, and good morals at times, over all the story's dialogue seems artificial and forced, and it seems to waver between wanting to be a drama and a comedy, and successfully being neither.<br /><br />Personally, the story wasn't very gripping or interesting, and part of this is due to lack of believability. Most films do not have to be realistic because they are solely based on entertaining, but if you are going to make a film about a serious issue like teen pregnancy or abortion then at least make it somewhat authentic.  Many scenes are understated, and you have to second guess whether this is how parents would really react. Consider the scene where Juno first tells her father and mother-in-law that she is pregnant. To use a word that Juno uses herself, her parents were way too "cavalier" about her news and her decision to have an abortion, not being riled up in the slightest and seemingly giving her the "OK" for it. Not only that, but she can even go to the abortion clinic alone.  Also, the scenes with Juno and her friend Paulie are way too lackadaisical, and the idea of Juno actually falling for someone who is her polar opposite and has no chemistry with is a bit ludicrous. (If so, why wasn't there any chemistry built between them in the film?)  I found Juno's character to be somewhat unbelievable as well; she has some elements of being a teenager with her smart aleck attitude and witticisms, but then she goes around being worldly and sophisticated also.<br /><br />The cute, hip dialogue gets little tiresome after awhile as well. Juno seems to be a film screaming "Look how indie and hip I am!"<br /><br />True, Juno's being up for last year's Best Picture really set the bar for expectations. Perhaps the public ate it up. (However, this award rarely is given to exceptional films anymore).  I watched Juno once, and once is enough. It's not horrible, but there is nothing that makes it exceptional either.</p></body></html>

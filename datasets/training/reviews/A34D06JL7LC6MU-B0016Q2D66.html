It scored a couple of Oscar nominations and many critics called it one of the best films of the year, but it certainly avoided a large audience. Mendes' first film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CWL6">American Beauty (Widescreen Edition)</a> was his masterpiece and the two films he followed up with it (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLBQ">Road to Perdition (Widescreen Edition)</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZIGDU">Jarhead (Widescreen Edition)</a>) were not without merit. I don't hesitate to say that this is his best film since American Beauty and is almost the film's counterpart. While American Beauty portrayed the darkly comical underbelly of suburbia, Revolutionary Road shows the tragic, claustrophobic grip of it.<br /><br />The setting is Eisenhower-era Connecticut, which is where Frank (DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Winslet) live in a nice suburban home on Revolutionary Road. Having given up on their aspirations to raise their children, Frank works at Knox Business Machines (a job he hates) while April fills her position as housewife. Feeling smothered by the suburban lifestyle they're trapped in, April proposes that the family move to Paris. She wants to get away, but she also wants to give Frank a chance to find his passion. While their friends find the plan absurd, the Wheeler's are steadfast in their determination. But, as things begin to change, the Wheeler's see their dreams start to crumble right along with their marriage.<br /><br />Don't expect too many surprises, I warn you. The film has an ominous musical score, reminiscent of American Beauty (fitting, as the same composer Thomas Newman scored both films) that clearly foreshadows things aren't going to play out in the happiest way. On the subject of music however, there is perfectly placed '50s era music scattered throughout the movie that marvelously puts us in this timeframe. The set direction (by Kristi Zea) and the costume design (by Albert Wolsky) are both perfect in the film. The beautiful recreation of 1950's suburbia perfectly contrasts the empty attitude of the character's.<br /><br />The acting is, of course, the film's selling point. Winslet is a reliable actress that likely would've won her 2008-Oscar for this film had she not made <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PPLJIQ">The Reader</a>. Not any actress could capture feelings of emptiness and claustrophobia in this performance, but Winslet does it flawlessly. A true actress Winslet is.<br /><br />DiCaprio is one of the most successful actor's in Hollywood, but he's not without his detractors. His performance as Frank is a powerhouse of pent-up frustration and emotion. I think this is one of his best and certainly one of his most powerful performances. The two performances together are so vividly realized, you'll forget this is the "Jack & Rose reunion." They completely outshine those performances.<br /><br />With all the star-power this film has backing it, the Academy only acknowledged one performance in this film. The character is John, the adult son of the Wheeler's neighbors who has only recently been allowed to leave the psychiatric hospital he's been staying at. The actor is Michael Shannon, who has only two scenes and a small amount of screen time. Shannon impressed me in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000T5O48K">Bug (Special Edition)</a>, but I don't think he has previously been given a role that allowed him to really showcase his talent. As John, he makes quite an impression as the only person able to see right through the Wheeler's facade. He has the most powerful dialouge in the film and he is so stand-out, it's easy to see why the Academy singled him out among these other, well-known actors.<br /><br />Revolutionary Road goes deep into the inner workings of suburbia, a crumbling marriage, and the unhappiness of these people. It doesn't explore these themes subtly, but gives the audience a very clear view into them. It's based on a 48-year-old novel by Richard Yates and was brought to the screen all these years later because it's still a very relevant story. Look no further for proof than the recent, overpublicized Jon & Kate debacle. This film is not a subtle meditation, it's a realistic exploration.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, heartwrenching film...Definitely among the best films of 2008. It's powerful, effusive, and impressive considering the subject matter has the makings of a soap-opera and instead is a real human drama. While not a happy movie by any stretch of the imagination. I highly recommend this film.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

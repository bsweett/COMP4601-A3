<meta name="summary" content="Poignant and thought provoking"></head><body><p>"Revolutionary Road" is a poignant and thought provoking film about a young married couple living the so-called American Dream. Frank has a job as a salesman in New York City, April is a housewife and mother with unrealized dreams of being an actress. Moving to Paris seems to be the solution to their stagnant lives. But, comfort, fear and the inability to blindly leap proves to be the catalyst that makes them reach their boiling point.<br /><br />Frank and April always thought they were above it all, above the suburban lifestyle, that they were special and this was just a stop on the road to something marvelous. Then, they start to confront the idea that they are just like anyone else, that this is their life now and forever and that they have and are living a frustrated and unrealized life. Frank and April feel trapped in their suburban life. They resent the job, the house and also their marriage. Their unfulfillment and general unhappiness lead to explosive quarrels that little by little corrode the couple's relationship. The movie was raw and honest, delving deeply into a relationship and the idea of living a compromised life. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio were nothing short of astounding in their performances and the movie itself was perfectly and artistically shot. 4.5 stars.</p></body></html>

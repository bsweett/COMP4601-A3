<meta name="summary" content="A good package for fans of the series, despite the price."></head><body><p>Having seen (and owned) "Evil Dead" in many different forms, it is nice to finally get an all-inclusive version. Anchor Bay is notorious for lousy video transfers (the VHS version of Halloween), but this one is surprisingly good. This neat little "Book of the Dead" is a great collectible, assuming you have the cash for it. <p>Rather than give a plot synopsis (if you are reading this, chances are you&#65533;ve seen the movie many times), I will say that this is the only real "Horror" movie in the Evil Dead Trilogy. While "Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn" and the later "Army of Darkness" were more comedy than horror, the first installment is a strait-forward horror outing. What sets it apart from other 80&#65533;s horror movies is Sam Raimi&#65533;s stylish direction and Tom Sullivan&#65533;s extremely gross special effects. "Evil Dead" is perhaps the goriest of all the 1980&#65533;s horror flicks, with blood, guts, and body parts flying everywhere. But it is done in such a way as to make it a stylish horror movie, not a snuff film like a lot of early 80&#65533;s "Video Nasties".<p>Anchor Bay gave us quite a package with this edition, so fans of the series can rejoice. Included are no less than 2 documentaries, one by Bruce Campbell himself called "Fanalysis", which give an insight into the world of fandom as seen at conventions. Campbell makes a piece similar to that is "Trekkies", showing all types, and all degrees, of fans. The "Evil.Dead" fans, by the looks of things, are the most civilized out of the bunch. The second documentary is called "Discovering Evil Dead", which has interviews with two early proprietors of home video who discovered "Evil Dead", and were responsible for getting it released to the general public. Also included are the outtakes, bios, trailers, and other supplements. <p>The quality of the movie itself it nice, even though I have heard people complain about the "matted" widescreen. The only other prints I have to compare it to are the Thorn EMI release from the early 80&#65533;s, and Anchor Bay&#65533;s abysmal re-release that I bought in 1998. The image is clear, but a bit grainy in parts. This is to be expected in a print as old as this, and especially in low-budget movies, also like this. I have always loved "Evil Dead", and am happy that I now own it on DVD<p>My biggest complaint is the price tag, which is steep no matter how you look at it. This costs as much as some DVD box sets, and considering the extras, this is still only 1 DVD with a fancy book included. If you are a diehard fan of the series, and want to own a "Deluxe, Limited Edition" print of this movie, than this is definitely the thing for you. If you are indifferent to the extras and just want a good quality print with perhaps a few supplements, than the other editions are a better bet.</p></body></html>

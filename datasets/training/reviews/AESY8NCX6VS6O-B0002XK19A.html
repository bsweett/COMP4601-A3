<meta name="summary" content="Yes, it's better, and Alfred Molina is absolutely brilliant"></head><body><p>One of the things that endeared me to the first Spider-Man film (and the first Matrix film) was its provision that it was a cheesey, comic book movie and not afraid to embrace that. I've always believed that super-hero movies/action-adventure movies shouldn't take themselves so seriously, because when they do it usually blows (Reloaded). Well, whereas the Matrix movies got all wrapped up in themselves, the second installment of Spider-Man is still as ready as ever to let that cornball dialogue fly. And that's not a bad thing. There's a real charm to this movie, like its predecessor, that elevates it to a much higher level than the mindless summer flicks with which it plays.<p>  And yes, it is better than the first film. "Leaps and bounds" better, as some critics are saying? No. But it's far more complex, more exciting, and more playful than the original. And while I'm on the subject of complexity, I have to mention maybe one of the greatest superhero villain creations of all time: 2's Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina). Molina, and the writing and concept behind his character, is really the strength of the film. I was endlessly fascinated by how layered he is: he starts out as a completely aimable man, gets wrapped up in the notion of scientific discovery, becomes a slave to his work, then gives himself over to it, and pursues Spider-Man...not because he's bad, but to advance his scientific cause. Doc Ock makes other movie villains, naturally and illogically evil, look like cardboard cut-outs. <p>  And the plot that grounds the film in realism is intriguing, too. Writer Alvin Sargent's script explores the psychological complexities of being a superhero: sure, Maguire's Peter Parker is a superhero, but why can't he choose to be a normal 20something instead? Is his 'higher calling' so much that he should sacrifice his whole life as well? These questions aren't answered in some ridiculous way, but simply worked out through the smooth, churning gears of the movie's narrative that never slows down too much and picks up to a giddily exciting pitch during the action scenes (that subway fight!). Yes, all the stuff with Mary Jane and Aunt May is shamelessly cheesey, but it's never off-putting. In fact, a scene in which Parker and M.J. walk and talk down a night-time New York street is as well-executed and honest as similar scenes in any recent drama.<p>  Neither Spider-Man movie has been a great film; the fact that this is based on a comic book will always add a level of subliminal silliness that will never be 'overcome.' But why, really? Spider-Man 2 sets out to do something, accomplishes it well, and met my expectations. Even within the constraints of a comic book, though, it reaches depth that few movies of its kind bother to tackle and really makes us care about the characters, and not in a superficial way (James Franco's Harry Osborn is a great example of that - he's set up to be a villain, but do we blame him really?). And it's fun. I'm sick of movies trying and failing to inspire real terror when dark comedy should be the objective - a sublime scene in an operating room had me rolling in my seat and, agree with me or not, I think that was director Sam Raimi's intention. <p>  Should Spider-Man 2 have had the ending it did? Not really. The first two fades-to-black would have made much more compelling conclusions to the film; in fact, I would have been ready to applaud the movie had it ended where you think it might the first time. But why gripe about a final scene that, though syrupy as hell, made me happy in spite of it all? Of course, that's a feeling that stayed with me every minute of the movie, too.

One is the story of a serial killer who is kidnapping women and eluding authorities. One is the story of an FBI trainee who only wants to make it to FBI status. One, and perhaps the most chilling and complex of the three, is the story of a highly intellectual man with a taste for human flesh, kept hidden from the world until it becomes evident that he may have a way of helping the trainee discover the whereabouts of the killer. <p>Adapted from the novel by Thomas Harris, the film is a cauldron of mixed emotions that the audience will feel in every chilling moment. Jonathan Demme has created a masterpiece of the mind as well as a chilling thriller to jangle the nerves until the final, climactic ending. <p>When FBI trainee Clarice Starling is called upon to question Hannibal Lector, she readily accepts the mission in hopes of impressing her superiors. When she arrives at the asylum where he is held, the head of the facility heavily warns her about Lector's crimes: killing people and eating the flesh of his victims. When she comes face-to-face with Hannibal, she learns that he is more than a monster: he is an intellectual machine with a flair for large words and turning colorful phrases. He ultimately lends clues to Clarice in exchange for information about the case, and soon for information about her personal life, hoping to dive into the depths of her mind. Clarice hesitates, but gives him what he wants in order to get closer to solving the crime before the next victim is killed. <p>This film is such a masterpiece in terms of horror and suspense. This is not one of the average run-of-the-mill scare machines that comes along almost every year. This movie is so much more complex, so complex that it can be frightening. Among some of the factors that will have you feeling chills are the way in Clarice regails the experiences of her childhood to Hannibal, which is so depressing and emotional that you feel for her. She appears so broken that it looks as if she is reliving the entire experience, while at the same time keeping the one goal in mind to find the serial killer at large. <p>The most frightening of all is the way in which Hannibal is portrayed. Perhaps one of the most unique villians in all of Hollywood, the best part of his character is that the movie and novel do not play him out as a lunatic, but instead as a highly intelligent psychologist whose only crime is that of cannibalism. In the end, it's not so much the actions of his past that are frightening as much as the ability he has to get into Clarice's mind and dredge up horrifying memories from her past, all the while focusing his eyes only on her eyes, seemingly peering inside her very soul. <p>The outside story is filled with mounting suspense as the FBI closes in on the killer named Buffalo Bill, who skins his victims of their flesh in order to achieve something more chilling. Hannibal is able to offer information to the authorities as to the background of the man who they suspect is the killer, and the way in which he offers his information is quite suspenseful. It becomes evident that Clarice is going to be the one who finds the killer because of her relationship and communication with Lector. We find that he has a deep emotional attachment to her because of what she tells him about her past, and you'll find that to be one of the most intense realizations of the movie. <p>The two leads both won Academy Awards for their performances in this picture, and it's quite easy to see why. Jodie Foster is remarkable and stunning as Clarice Starling, who is innocent in the beginning and becomes swept up in emotional trauma and stress as she allows Lector to question her about her past. Her performance here is intense and true. Anthony Hopkins is masterful as Hannibal Lector, and his performance here is the entire centerpiece for the suspense of the film. Hopkins plays every aspect of Lector's persona to perfection, a great achievement in his acting career. <p>Winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is a complex and stunning tale that dives deep into the minds of its characters and goes straight to the mind of its audiences. Expectations are sure to be met, for the movie has everything you could want: intelligence, thrills, chills, scares, action, emotion, and complexity. You'll find yourself waking up in the middle of the night, seeing the eyes of Hannibal Lector looking straight at you.</p></body></html>

Who would've thought! The whole cast shines in this film-now I want to see the original again and the play. I wouldn't expect so many people and critics to enjoy this but they did! The music numbers esp. are really good, some actors I never imagined could sing, surprised me, because they could.<br />Anyone who doesn't like musicals, should at least give this chance, but don't expect a scene-for-scene remake of the 1988 version, this one stands alone.</p></body></html>

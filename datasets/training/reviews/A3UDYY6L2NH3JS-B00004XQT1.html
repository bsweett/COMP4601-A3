From a simple vision of the yuppy who is psychotic and kills to get his kicks in the financial world and goes through with it because he is a yuppy, it becomes the description of his psychosis and we do not know at the end if he has really killed or only imagined the killings. We are a lot more led into thinking that it is all a bad dream, a nightmare, a psychotic hallucination. It thus becomes the third panel of a tryptic. The American Dream first, which has to do with the dream of people arriving in the US and succeeding in making fortunes, or at least enough money to become the middle or upper middle class : the opera of American success and capitalism in its positive understanding. The American Nightmare then, which shows how those who do not succeed in making that first trip into wealth, fame and power, are led into killing, crime, at times sordid crime. These are the losers and they can only survive in this wolfish society as wolves and criminals. Capitalism leads to crime, either petty crime for the poor losers or organized crime for the more ambitious. The American psychosis is the third element, with crime developing in the mind of a successful subject in order to fuel his success. It is the story of the Golden Boys, of the Yuppies who have to be so ruthless with others in order to dominate and have the upper hand in the financial field that they develop, inside themselves, a completely murderous psychology. The only missing element is the urban paranoia that Stephen King explores in, his books, i.e. the fear of standard average Americans that their neighbors be enemies of the system, hence of them, and try to take over the system and make them slaves to their outlandish, extraterrestrial, revolutionary, dictatorial, funtamentalistic, dogmatic or sectarian objectives aiming at seizing power and then retaining it.<p>This American Psycho is absolutely essential to understand modern America. It is very well connected with the period (the 80s) and President Ronald Reagan, with his speech on the Irangate were he explains that this crime of money, warfare, power and politics is a good thing after all because it reassesses and reasserts the power of America within and without the US. Crime leads to power, and power requires crime, even if it does not justify it, and even if it does not have to be justified, except with the positive result of making America stronger in the world.<p>A great film for advanced viewers who are able to go beyond the surface of things.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

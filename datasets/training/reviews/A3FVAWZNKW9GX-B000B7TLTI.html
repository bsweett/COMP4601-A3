<meta name="summary" content="Taking the Superhero Genre Into New Places"></head><body><p>There are two crowds with this movie. Those who think it was OK, and those who think it is brilliant. Few dislike it.<br /><br />My thoughts here are strong -- Brilliant, and then some.<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is the beginning of a new era of superhero movies. It pokes at the genre, and it tells a fantastic story in the process. More than a parody, it has a rich pro-family flavor, folded into a drama about relationships, yet never taking itself too seriously.<br /><br />The Plot<br /><br />Take a couple with superpowers, move them into a federal protection program after superheroes are sued, give them three kids who aren't allowed to use their powers, and wait. Prod them occasionally with anxiety and restlessness to keep them in minor trouble. Soon, a powerful, intelligent enemy bent on becoming a self-made messiah will come along.<br /><br />Will the retired and in-hiding superheroes don the uniforms and save the day? Can they after all these years? Who is this amazing arch enemy?<br /><br />Does my version of the plot tell as well as it works in the movie? Probably not, because what is missing is the funny sight gags, situation humor, and spectacular animation. You also don't hear the swift one-liners, allusions to classic comic books or sarcasm about society.<br /><br />The movie soars farther than the average superhero movie because, like Spiderman, it looks into the reality of the kind of personal life a superhero would have. If a world with superheroes existed, what would it be like? While the X-Men movies have attempted to address this, the concept of Charles Xavier's mansion is not easy to believe. Thinking that after Mr. Incredible unretired, he would have a beer gut is believable. These superheroes are just like us, after all, only "super."<br /><br />The art and design of "The Incredibles" is not the usual either. Calling it art may seem too much, and I don't want to suggest that this is an animated version of the Louvre. However, "The Incredibles" angles beyond comic book art, and into art deco, and pop art akin to a more sophisticated, moving Andy Warhol.<br /><br />The messages in the movie encourage us to be ourselves, be humble, do the right thing, and, in the case of peril, be courageous.<br /><br />I fully recommend "The Incredibles." I am looking for a sequel or two, and am hoping they can continue this style and quality.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></body></html>

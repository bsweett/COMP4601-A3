It can get a bit confusing at times, but I thought it was a very bold attempt that succeeds on many levels. The DVD is excellent with some great extras and a good DVD transfer. Please don't call me a F***ing Tool for not giving it 5 stars!....LOL!;-b (someone did this in a comment).....too mucking fuchh! ;-)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""We're in the business of winning.""></head><body><p>"Friday Night Lights" tells of the 1988 Odessa, Texas high school football team.  In Texas, football is king, and the hopes and dreams of entire towns can ride on their team.  Odessa won state championships before, but this team is perhaps a bit smaller than usual, and the coach is new and untested.  Fortunately, they have Boobie Miles, a star player who could possibly carry them to the state championship.  The movie follows these players over the season, as the town alternates between rallying around them and vilifying them.<br /><br />Based on the non-fiction book by Buzz Bissinger, "Friday Night Lights" doesn't rely on the "big game" ending typical of sports movies.  The movie focuses on football, but it relies more on the characters.  It's about a town that is economically depressed and needs something behind which to rally.  "Friday Night Lights" could be just another Cinderella sports story.  However, it's not about winning - it's about the pressure the town puts on the team and the coach.  Fortunately, the acting is superb, especially Lucas Black ("Sling Blade") as the glowering quarterback and Derek Luke ("Antwone Fisher") as the star, Boobie.  You feel for these boys; you want them to win; but most of all, you want them to have some kind of life after the season draws to a close.  That's what "Friday Night Lights" is all about, and it's a really terrific movie.</p></body></html>

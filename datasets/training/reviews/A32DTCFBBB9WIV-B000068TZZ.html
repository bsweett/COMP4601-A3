But putting this fact aside and judging only the movie, not the man behind the cameras, you'll see this is a good movie, although violent and exaggerated. The acting is very good,  the budget is low (and this is a merit for Tarantino). Anyway, we soon saw  how limited this director is when not dealing with violence and ideas he  steals from older movies, comic books and songs.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dark and creamy"></head><body><p>&quot;Chocolat&quot;, chocolate in french, is one of the few quality fables filmed in history.  Its sweet tooth theme is perfect with the characters' emotions.  The old town french town was wonderfully crafted.  The fashion designers crafted the costumes perfectly to look 1959.  Lasse Hallstrom directed this movie brilliantly.  The writers give the movie the extra unique touches that most other today's movies need.  They make all the events fit together as one. <p>Juliette Dimoche was the perfect actress to play Vianne, a chocolate cook whom most of the town calls her &quot;Satan&quot; for no reason.  Judi Dench wonderfully portrays a cranky old woman whose fate becomes unexpected.  Both deserved their Oscar nominations.  Johnny Depp proves that he's improved greatly in the past few years in his role as a river drifter who falls in love with Vianne.  Lena Olin plays a battered wife emotionally.<br /><br />***Important word of caution: One will become very hungry while watching this movie.  A small bowl of chocolate will cure the craving and will give the experience an extra touch.</p></body></html>

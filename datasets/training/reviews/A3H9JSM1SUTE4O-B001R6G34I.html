<meta name="summary" content="KING KONG DIED FOR YOUR SINS?"></head><body><p>There was a poster popular during the 60s that showed the bound giant ape from the 1933 film on a stage with his arms outstretched under the caption: "King King died for your sins."<br /><br />Some saw it as blasphemy, or a mockery of the Christian religion.  While others of a more astute state of mind recognized the metaphor of the ferocious primitive instinct succumbing to the modern savagery of civilization with the bait of impossible sexuality and intimacy as a reward.<br /><br />Much has been written about the power of Kong's imagery and its impact when it was first released during the lingering great depression.<br /><br />Is there anyone who does not yet realize how we have sacrificed and exploited the finite resources of the primal world for our temporary gain?  What have we forever lost in the process?<br /><br />This week, Warner Home Video releases a newly remastered Blu-ray KING KONG (1933) with extensive bonus content, including a collectible Blu-ray Book written by renowned film historian Rudy Behlmer; a feature length documentary on Kong creator Merian C. Cooper, directed by acclaimed filmmakers Kevin Brownlow and Christopher Bird; commentary by Ray Harryhausen, Ken Ralston with vintage audio clips from Cooper and star Fay Wray; and a seven-part documentary that delves deeply into just about every aspect of the creation and production of this truly iconic film.<br /><br />With 32 pages of rare photographs and trivia, the captivating Blu-ray Book centers around the vision of director Cooper and his lager than life persona that brought the story of KING KONG to the screen.<br /><br />Film historian Behlmer interviewed Cooper and has written numerous books and contributed to many documentaries about Hollywood's Golden Age.<br /><br />This very special Blu-ray release is a newly remastered presentation of the 1933 premiere print in its entirety.  It includes controversial scenes that were cut from later re-releases.  Max Steiner's rousing score still stirs the blood.<br /><br />KING KONG was a milestone in movie making with pioneering special effects that incorporated miniaturization, stop-motion photography, rear screen inserts with miniatures and real sets.  The movie works on many levels beyond the obvious amalgam of adventure, monster, romance and horror.<br /><br />The film was way ahead of its time and defied the technological limitations of the 1930s.  Special effects pioneer Willis O'Brien was incredibly imaginative and effective -- even in today's era of photorealistic CGI effects.<br /><br />Although Peter Jackson's superb remake touches all the deeper emotional levels of Cooper's original story and is indeed a loving tribute, there remains something powerful and profound about this amazing piece of art that resonates with us today.<br /><br />See again this magnificent, strikingly original film directed and produced by Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack with stars Robert Armstrong, Bruce Cabot and Fay Wray whose indelible performance as distressed Ann Darrow forever locked Wray into the upper echelons of pop culture as the original "scream queen" and a role model of a resilient, independent woman for generations to come.<br /><br />Not long ago, someone sent me a piece of digitally Photoshopped art that shows the incoming terrorist jets approaching the World Trade Center and a still shackled Kong perched atop the twin towers taking down the planes before they can do their damage.  The caption: "Where was Kong when we needed him?"  Indeed.<br /><br />Merian Caldwell Cooper was a tough, adventurous guy.  He was the real deal.  He made several documentaries in wild, remote areas with his filmmaking partner Ernst B. Schoedsack.  But he invested everything he had in his planned production of a fictional depiction of an expedition that finds a great ape surviving from another age on an unmapped island.  When Cooper wrote his treatment for the movie, he said he had the ending before anything else.  "It was beauty killed the beast," he said.  That may be true, but with this new hi-def disc, King Kong lives forever.</p></body></html>

Such is the case with "Michael Clayton", a decidedly B-Grade film all dressed up in A-Grade packaging. Of course, at the end of 2007, critics were notoriously tripping over themselves to call this turkey the 'best film of the year'. How such a tag can be given to such nonsense is debatable, but it also supports the theory that if you get enough people to say that something is good, the general public will soon start accepting that its good as well. In "Michael Clayton"'s case, it is especially bizarre considering this film is so poorly made, so poorly acted, that everyone looks extremely happy at the end when the credits roll.<br /><br />Special mention must be made of the ten minute long scene during the end credits when the camera 'lovingly' focusses on George Clooney's face as he sits in a taxi doing NOTHING. Seriously. The normally wooden actor looks positively terrified as he struggles to come up with even one emotion, and at the end he decides not to show any emotion at all. This was by far the worst scene of the entire film as it reduced the movies' nothingness to even MORE nothingness. Literally.<br /><br />The movie supposedly chronicles Michael's victory over U-North, a firm that is 'evil' and 'conniving' and whose spokesperson and head is played by Tilda Swinton. The woman won an Oscar for this role. She is barely in the movie for fifteen minutes (seriously). When she does have screentime, she has only one expression - a stiff upper lip and a very corporate expression that is the easiest thing in the world to pull off. The rest of the time the camera follows her laying her clothes out on her bed and deciding what to wear. This is an Oscar-worthy performance? I simply do not understand. That was no good acting or bad acting here. There was just no acting. Period.<br /><br />There is a scene where George Clooney's car explodes and he realizes that he was the target of a car-bomb. Watch his expressions in this scene to rediscover just how horrible and useless an actor he is. Do this people undergo auditions to get these parts? I think not. He shows no surprise or sadness or shock, and goes through the motions until the mind-numbingly boring finale that is supposed to 'knock your socks off', but just comes and goes.<br /><br />This is a long film, with no story, no heart, and definitely no soul OR talent. However, scene for scene, it caters to people who like coming up with 'serious' films on their year-end lists. I like intelligent cinema and world cinema with a passion, and this really tested my patience. It didn't say anything one way or the other, and after a long time I discovered that I had seen a film that was a 'waste of space'. Here was two hours of my life I am not getting back. What a pity. The script lagged, the acting was terrible, and the direction was shoddy. I usually have at least one good thing to say about a movie, but I really can't lie and say anything nice about this one.<br /><br />Avoid like the plague. There are much better films to watch from last year. And you should remind yourself that anything with George Clooney in a lead role is invitation enough to skip.<br /><br />Two Stars.</p></body></html>

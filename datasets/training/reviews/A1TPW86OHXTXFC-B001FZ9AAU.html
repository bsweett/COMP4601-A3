The plot though thin, rang true and the superhero is expected to do some real acting. Though his feats are amazing, it is the scenery, his soul and the people supporting him that make this film so good.<br /><br /> Robert Downey, Jr plays Ray Stark, he owns a company that makes and sells high tech weaponry. At the moment he is in Afghanistan showing off his weaponry, when his group is attacked. He spends the next three months  building a suit to protect his new heart and himself. In the process he escapes and comes back to to life in California. Iron Man has a great cast of characters- Terrence Howard, as the military man, Gwyneth Paltrow as his girl Friday and Jeff Bridges as his accomplice in the company- Bridges really wears black. Needless  to say the plot thickens and Iron Man goes on to build a new suit to defend his newly found ethical behavior and save the day.<br /><br />Save the day, he does- Robert Downy Jr is a first rate actor with emotional liability and he is the Iron Man. The other actors are also first rate and this is the film of the past year, IMO.<br /><br />There is a shocking revelation and the hardware is impressive. This is a fun film for all.  The computer aided visuals are impressive and Iron Man, well he has Soul!<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 01-02-09<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DE29SS">Chaplin (15th Anniversary Edition)</a></p></body></html>

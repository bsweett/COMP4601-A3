Mel Gibson is such a great hero, caring about his men, and the movie is sad, shocking, yet worst of all bassed on true events, that made me feel sad for those who died in the Vietnam war. Only those who's life it touched can really feel the tragedy but this  movie made me respect what peace is today.<br />I highly reccomined it to everyone.</p></body></html>

Well, widescreen would be intended for the theatres, but full is what Zemeckis intended the audience to see. He admitted this himself.<br /><br />NOW.<br /><br />Reviews of the films:<br /><br />Back to the Future -<br /><br />Whether you classify this as science fiction, comedy, or fantasy, this movie could fit all three categories. In 1985, Marty McFly's good buddy, "Doc" Emmett Brown, has a DeLorean and is building a time machine out of it. So the two meet at a mall, which was once a pine tree farm, and test it, but when Marty is chased by Libyans, he is accidentally sent back to 1955, and this is where the movie really begins. He accidentally runs into his parents and the evil Biff and his henchmen. Instead of old man George getting run over by the car, Marty does, so Lorraine falls for her own son. But Doc sees a picture of the family and it is incomplete, so he advises Marty to get his real parents together or else he will "disappear from existence." When Marty gets back to 1985, he notices a dramatic change in his parents - his dad is not a nerd and his mom actually has self esteem, as do the siblings. Now if Marty himself can quit being a slacker... What stands out is the plot and what results from it, as well as some one-liners (Great scott! by Doc, and This is heavy! by Marty). To realize the full effect of this movie, you must watch the whole trilogy, even if Future II is a little repetive, while III is better than II, but not the original, of course.<br /><br />Back to the Future Part II -<br /><br />BTTFII somehow manages to remain fresh and original. Unlike most other sequels like "Rambo: First Blood part two", the Rocky sequels, Superman sequels, and the Batman sequels, this one remains to be as good as the first one. The story can get a little predictable at times and has a few minor plot holes if you haven't seen the last film, but it gives you a few plot twists that make it interesting. Michael J. Fox is simply hilarious in this film as well as everyone else. The special effects are great too even by today's standards. Overall, this is another great sequel for its franchise.<br /><br />Back to the Future Part III -<br /><br />The cast and crew, from the last two Back to the Future movies are back to deliver another comedic performance for the entire family. What can I say about this film? The film offers everything the last two had with loveable characters, clever plot twists, and many memorable scenes. This last one is still fairly predictable and has some plot holes if you haven't seen the last two films, but the plot twists will leave you in suspense. Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox are brilliant in this film, so the wild west never looked like so much fun.<br /><br />Overall, the Back to the Future series is a great movie trilogy for the whole family to enjoy, and I hope you'll agree too.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The extras include commentaries on all 3 films, deleted scenes, featurettes, outtakes, and much more behind the scenes stuff! If you own a DVD player, the Back to the Future trilogy is a must have for your DVD collection. The only minor annoyance is that they are only selling it as a set and the fact that they are trying to trick everyone into buying the cropped widescreen versions. But, the set isn't too big of a problem. Besides, you were going to get all three anyway...weren't you? :)</p></body></html>

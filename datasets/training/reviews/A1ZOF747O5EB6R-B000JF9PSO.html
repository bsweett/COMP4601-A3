It's a roller coaster ride of adrenalin and jagged emotions.  It's also poignant at times and very close to the bone.  Most importantly, it's about an event that was true.<br /><br />I saw "United 93" in Sydney as part of the Sydney Film Festival where it received applause at its end.  This rarely happens in Australia.  This is a film that touches everyone.  It is a film that must be seen!<br /><br />Of course, we all know what happened on 11 September 2001.  Thus, the core of the film has no surprises.  However, having said this, the film so clearly reveals how ordinary people going about their own lives were suddenly thrust into a living hell.  Psychotic religious fanatics had come to believe that by hijacking planes and killing innocent people that this would somehow damage the US and heighten the spread of Islam.  Has collective lunacy ever reached such insane heights?  These criminals were not warriors, they were simply misguided killers.  Their inherent evil, unfortunately, came at the cost of so many lives.<br /><br />This film covers the events of that tragic day very well.  We see chaos as both individuals and government bodies simply fail to adequately comprehend the events unfolding around them.  This should come as no surprise as there would be no one who could have expected criminal stupidity on the scale that was seen on that bright September day.  To all those involved in the making of "United 93", you are owed much gratitude as you have so lucidly told a tale of courage in the face of evil.</p></body></html>

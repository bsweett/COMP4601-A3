<meta name="summary" content="How to review a movie I didn't even watch..."></head><body><p>INSIDE MAN - Russian menus, audio in Russian or English, subtitles in Chinese or Chinese<br /><br />And you guessed it. I'm still watching DVDs we brought from China. This one, for example, stars Denzel Washington and Jodiet Foster.<br /><br />I have no reason to doubt it is as advertised, but I only lasted 15 minutes. The English audio was a bit distorted, no subtitles, and I'm sorry to report that Mr Washington developed a case of high-speed mumbles here. And, after all, it is only a bank hostage movie. Hard to care. Sorry folks.</p></body></html>

Behind her can be seen a poster whose message inspired her and this film's creators to achieve greatness. It reads, "Winners are simply willing to do what losers won't", a message easily applied both to struggling athletes and filmmakers who desire to meet and exceed their dreams.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" masquerades as a Rocky-meets-Thelma & Louise, a film about a female fighter overcoming the inherent adversity of trying to succeed in a man's sport inside a man's world. On many levels, the film aspires to address that issue, but to reduce it to that point is to fail to recognize the stunning insight it provides on the human heart. With almost limitless ambition, Eastwood tackles the mammoth subjects of lifelong regret, penance and the responsibilities tethered to love.<br /><br />Decorated with the soft tones of Eastwood's own score and narrated by the dulcet voice of Morgan Freeman, "Million Dollar Baby" recreates the warm, comfortable feeling of hearing your grandfather tell a story by the fireplace. With slow pacing and development, the film focuses on a determined fighter, Maggie, trying to convince Eastwood's Frankie to train and manage her. Motivation and toughness are not enough for Frankie who tells her "girlie tough is not enough."<br /><br />Undaunted by his initial rejection, she preservers and convinces Frankie to handle her career. Not since "Rudy" has a character been so determined to reach a goal. A rare return to traditional values, Maggie's story borrows from inspirational tales about people who were able to meet all their aspirations. Compared to her hillbilly family (welfare, illegitimate children, prison), Maggie appears to succeed in life because she sets goals, works hard and makes proper decisions. "Million Dollar Baby" does not perpetuate the popular myth found in most Hollywood features that success is handed out to lucky people and failure results from disadvantages. Eastwood's film suggests everyone creates their own place in the world through the cumulative results of their actions and decisions.<br /><br />Once she begins her career, a second story unfolds that I would rather refrain from mentioning. Like "Fight Club" or "The Crying Game", the film contains a surprise which potential viewers should try to avoid knowing. But even if the ending is known, "Million Dollar Baby" succeeds because it gives its audience real characters who will inspire and challenge with their depth and truth. Like his lead pugilist, Eastwood shows greatness results when he is willing to do what other filmmakers won't.</p></body></html>

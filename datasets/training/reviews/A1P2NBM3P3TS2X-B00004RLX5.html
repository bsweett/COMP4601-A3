<meta name="summary" content="Fun movie, but flawed disc."></head><body><p>The movie is funny and stands up as perhaps the most entertaining of the series.  But Disc 2 in my set, the disc with the supplemental material, has a major flaw:  the individual selection choices for b-t-s docs, etc., don't highlight.  You can't really tell which item your remote is selecting.  After a bit of trial and error you can maneuver through, but it takes quite a bit of experimenting.  <p>Perhaps other customers may or may not have had this problem.  I know my DVD player works fine, so maybe this particular batch of discs is flawed.  <p>So keep a lookout for that.  The material still plays (so far), but navigating through and selecting the material you want is VERY user-unfriendly.<p>Hopefully most consumers won't encounter this problem, but surely I can't be the only one who has.</p></body></html>

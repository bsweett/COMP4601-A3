<meta name="summary" content="You will-a enjoy this movie film"></head><body><p>I went into this movie expecting the worst. I'm not a fan of the Ali G show, and I was sure that I would hate this movie and think the humor trite and overblown. I was wrong. Borat was so funny, I had to apologize to the friend who wanted to see it for my initial skepticism.  It's political satire at its very best and the best part of it is that this movie isn't afraid to laugh at itself.  Borat pokes fun at everyone, not just America.  In fact, my only problem with this movie was the nude male fight scene which, while hilarious, went on too long for my taste.  I'd definitely recommend this movie if you're in the mood for a laughing good time.</p></body></html>

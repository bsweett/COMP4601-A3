<meta name="summary" content="Not bad if you've never seen a Jack Ryan Movie ..."></head><body><p>If you HAD however, this movie should, by all rights drive you crazy.  <p>Let me start by saying that if you're new to the Jack Ryan character and have never seen 'Patriot Games' or 'Clear and Present Danger' or 'The Hunt for Red October', then You'll probably really like this movie.  The preformances are all solid, the characters are intresting, the plot moves well, and the action scenes are a lot of fun.<p>If you HAD seen any of these movies though, you'll notice that the time-line for the four movies is REALLY messed up.  This is supposed to be the FIRST Jack Ryan movie, it's pointed out that he just started in the CIA.  Why then is this movie CLEARLY set in 2002?  Shouldn't it have been set back in the early to mid eighties?<p>I was floored that NOBODY making the movie seened to catch this REALLY OBVIOUS flaw in their characters story bible.  It drove me crazy through the whole movie.<p>So again, if you've never seen a Tom Clancy movie, you'll probably enjoy this movie a great deal.  If you had , however, you'll probably be a little on the disappointed side.</p></body></html>

It recently came to the forefront when I saw a stack of DVDs in my local warehouse club. I was tempted to buy, but didn't. But the sight prompted this review. This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. Absolutely stunning.<br /><br />"Brokeback Mountain" is a tragic love story, and it's tragic on every scale. It was set largely in rustic and scenic Wyoming (actually, Alberta) and it unfolded as two young men met as employees of a local rancher. Their task was to care for a herd of sheep on Brokeback Mountain over the summer months. They gradually became friends and then "special friends." At the end of the summer, they parted and went on with their lives including getting married and raising families. The experience of Brokeback Mountain, however, proved too strong and they gradually started getting back together again, and again. The result was an aching love story and a growing tragedy for the men, their families and all concerned. The story riveted my attention and was painful to watch. My girlfriend and I left the theater and we couldn't talk. We were both choked up by the emotional impact. We discussed it for the next several months, however. The movie was that powerful.<br /><br />Everyone associated with this film should get an award of some kind. The director gently reached out and grabbed hold of the audiences' attention. He then allowed the tragic story to unfold amid a spendid scenic backdrop and accompanied by wonderful music. In watching it, you feel as if you're a part of the story, or at least a fly on the wall. This film is amazing and very powerful. View it, by all means. If the subject matter bothers you, don't buy and complain. This film deserves a lot more respect than some of the coarse remarks in certain viewer reviews.</p></body></html>

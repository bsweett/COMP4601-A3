<meta name="summary" content="Assault on Precinct 13 (DVD)"></head><body><p>Critics have been groaning about the unprecedented number of remakes on the 2005 Hollywood release schedule, but the first out of the bag, "Assault on Precinct 13," is not at all bad, and gives hope the year may be less oppressively redundant than it looks on paper.<br /><br />The original was a low-budget 1976 siege thriller that John Carpenter made two years before his big commercial breakthrough with "Halloween," and which he claimed was inspired by the great Howard Hawks' westerns, specifically "Rio Bravo."<br /><br />In this update (with which Carpenter apparently has no creative connection), the hero is a guilt-ridden, burned-out police sergeant (Ethan Hawke) in charge of a dilapidated, inner-city precinct that's about to be abandoned with the new year. But when a howling blizzard paralyzes the city on New Year's Eve, a police bus is diverted to the station and its handful of detainees includes a recently arrested gang chieftain (Laurence Fishburne) who intends to rat out his corrupt partners in the police department.<br /><br />So, before long, the handful of cops working the holiday shift find themselves isolated by the elements, cut off from communication with the outside world and encircled by hostile forces intent on silencing the gangster and eliminating all witnesses.<br /><br />In the original, the derelict precinct was in L.A., its attackers were a marauding youth gang with no clear motivation, there was no holiday element and the hero had little traumatic back story to transcend in the course of the action.<br /><br />Thus, this remake is considerably different and, for once, the changes have not hurt the film. Indeed, while the plot is equally improbable, the snowbound setting and new set of motivations for everyone involved have, to my mind, improved the story.<br /><br />And French director Jean-Francois Richet has managed to keep the suspense tight and action hard-hitting while adding considerable texture to the story and getting the most out of a strong supporting cast that includes Gabriel Byrne, Maria Bello, Brian Dennehy and John Leguizamo.<br /><br />In the lead role, Hawke looks so bony and unhealthy that he makes you feel uncomfortable, but he's believable and effective, and he strikes some of the same grim-faced buddy chemistry with Fishburne that he had with Denzel Washington in "Training Day."<br /><br />Even so, Fishburne handily steals the movie from him. His gangster is a soft-spoken master of self-control who can communicate a world of meaning -- and menace -- in the slightest gesture or glint of his powerful eyes. It's a terrific character performance and a lot of fun.</p></body></html>

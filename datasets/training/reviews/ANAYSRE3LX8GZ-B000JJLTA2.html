<meta name="summary" content="Only a movie for those interested!"></head><body><p>At first when I saw this movie I thought nothing of it and dismissed it as nothing but somebody blending X-Men , The Incredible Hulk , and Mythical Creatures.... but after learning that this is a bunch of different storys of legends of the old fiction world I gave it one more go, and it seemed better the second time around!<p>A war has broken out during 1899? and the man behind it is a villian who calls himself &quot;the Fantom&quot; who really does all the worst acting of the film! His entrance was as bad as the whole plot of &quot;mortal kombat anhiahalation&quot; and his acting is near enough to fit into that movie! However, Sean Connery is a famous hunter by the name of &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot; who is asked to join a leage that is set to be like no other. Along with a Vampire who has somthing to do with Dracula, the Hulk type character of Dr.Jeckyl and Hyde, the 20,000 leages under the sea Captin Nemo, A guy who is invisable, and a guy who cant be killed.... By now you shouldve seen other reveiws of what the plots about, so i wont add another version to it!<p>I'll just say, this movie will appeal well to fans of X-Men and the Hulk, which is why i hated it at first, not beeing a fan of either, but after finding out that this was based on a story written long before either of the two had even been thought of, it seperated my feelings of this just beeing a movie thats blended in its own way a few of the recent hits in the box office! Give it at least a rental before you dismisss it!</p></body></html>

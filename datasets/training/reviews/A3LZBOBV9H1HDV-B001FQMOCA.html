Joaquin Phoenix gives his Oscar nominated, career-best performance as Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon is just as equally impressive in her Oscar-winning performance as June Carter. They also did their vocals to the songs they performed in the movie and on the soundtrack itself. This is one of the year's best! This is a well-crafted and impressively told story about one of the greatest music legends of any generation and the love story between him and June Carter, the woman that gave on him. James Mangold's directing is brilliant and one of his best films to date! The screenplay by Mangold and Gill Dennis (which is based on Johnny Cash's books, The Man In Black and Cash: An Autobiography, which Cash co-wrote with Patrick Carr) is brilliant! The music by T-Bone Burnett (who brought life to the music of "O Brother, Where Are You" (2000) is brillant! The songs are brilliant! The cinematography by Phedon Papamichael (who also did the cinematography to Mangold's "Identity" (2003) is excellent! The film editing (Oscar nominated) by Michael McCusker is great! The casting by Lisa Beach (who also did the casting to "Red Eye" (2005) & Mangold's "Identity" (2003), Shirley Fulton Crumley, & Sarah Katzman (who also did the casting to "Red Eye" (2005) & Mangold's "Identity" (2003) is great! The production design by David J. Bomba (who did the production design to "Secondhand Lions" (2003) is brilliant! The art direction by John R. Jensen (who did the art direction to "Secondhand Lions" (2003) & Rob Simons (who did the art direction for "Book Of Shadows: Blair Witch 2" (2000) is brilliant! The set decoration by Carla Curry (who also did the set direction to "Friday Night Lights" (2004) is brilliant! The costume design (Oscar nominated) by Arianne Phillips (who also did the costume design to Mangold's "Identity" (2003) is brilliant! This is a better biopic than "Ray" (2004)! Also nominated for Best Sound.</p></body></html>

CONFIDENTIAL Is the best film to come out of Hollywood in the last twenty years.<br /><br />This is prime film noir.  In future history books of the cinema, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL will be ranked right up there with the great ones, such as DOUBLE INDEMNITY, OUT OF THE PAST and THE BIG SLEEP.  And, as much as I admire and consistently enjoy those classic movies, I think that L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is the finest of the lot.<br /><br />Adapting James Ellroy's intricately-plotted, sometimes confusing, novel was certainly a monumental task for writer/director Curtis Hanson and his screenwriting collaborator, Brian Helgeland.  Not only did they have to bring to life  more than a half-dozen key characters, but there were also several intertwined  plot lines to juggle.<br /><br />Hanson and Helgeland have done an admirable job.  Their characters are real and, although the story is complicated, by the end credits, everything is explained.  There are no loose ends.  Truly, the movie is better than the book.<br /><br />Set in a superbly re-created 1950's Los Angeles, the film's primary storyline concerns the real reasons behind a mass murder in the Night Owl Cafe.  Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey, three police detectives of widely different backgrounds and agendas, ultimately join together to battle police corruption, the Mob and, at times, each other.  Along the way, they interact with some fascinating folk, including a hooker who looks like Veronica Lake (Oscar winner Kim Basinger), her rich pimp (David Strathairn) and the editor of a nasty scandal magazine (Danny DeVito).<br /><br />James Cromwell also co-stars as a police captain who is willing to break the rules.<br /><br />?

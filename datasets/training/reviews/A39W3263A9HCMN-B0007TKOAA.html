It is rather a "Serious" comedy with lots of laughs.<br /><br />The movie is about a couple of friends who go on a wine-tasting road trip before one of them gets married. On the way they meet two sexy chicks, Maya and Stephanie, and spend some time with them. On the trip, Maya finds out that Jack is getting married, and thus begins the downward spiral!<br /><br />SIDEWAYS, based on a novel by Rex Pickett, is a good film, but beware, there's full frontal nudity in the last 20 minutes! Also, The DVD commentary is hilarious, and there are two easter eggs.<br /><br />So see this!</p></body></html>

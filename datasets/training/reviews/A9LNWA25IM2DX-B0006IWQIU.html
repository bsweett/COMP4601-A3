<meta name="summary" content="Aliens and Predators are better separately"></head><body><p>We recently had re-editions of the two Predator movies and the unbelievable Alien Quadrilogy collection. These new versions or editions tried to prepare the audiences for what promised to be a match to remember, Alien vs. Predator.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie did not fulfill the expectations of the fans of the two alien creatures, but on the bright side it was more interesting and less campy than the previous crossover of Freddy vs. Jason. The film has some interesting points in the story but it takes too many liberties with the origin and purposes of the two main characters. The movie begins with Weyland enterprises (the same company who sends Ripley and her team to space on the first three alien films) assembling a team of specialists for a special mission to Antarctica, an interesting fact is that Mr. Charles Bishop Weyland is the same actor (Lance Henriksen) who played the characters of Bishop and Bishop II in the Alien series, which helps make the relation that he was the template for the droids.<br /><br />From then on, the story loses direction every passing moment, a pyramid was found in Antarctica and they must research why is it there and who built it. The answer? Predators built it so they could have fun hunting Aliens every 100 years. The team gets trapped in the middle of a pyramid filled with Aliens and Predators fighting each other.<br /><br />There are however some memorable sequences, the first encounter between the two creatures is just incredible, and even though the Predator ends up being the sidekick of specialist Alexa Woods (Saana Lathan), seeing the two alien species fighting each other is worth the movie. Even though the ending is basically the same stuff we already saw in Predator 2, the writer tried to give it a twist to let the door open for a sequel. I did enjoy this film because of the fighting and the visuals, but I have mixed feelings at the moment of deciding if the movie was good or not, I dare to say it is more of a visual feast than good storytelling and well, I kinda liked it.</p></body></html>

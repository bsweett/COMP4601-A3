<meta name="summary" content="Rock Lays the Smackdown"></head><body><p>"The Rundown" features the Rock in his second outing in a Hollywood leading role and he lays the smackdown.<p>THE STORY:<p>Beck (The Rock) is a bounty hunter sent on his "last case" to bring back his boss' errant son, petty hustler Travis (Sean William "Stifler" Scott) who is running amok in the Brazilian Amazon.  While in the Amazon Beck runs afoul of the ruthless local Overlord, becomes part of the people's revolution and along with Travis finds the secret fortune hidden deep in the jungle.<p>THE COOL THINGS:<p>Overall, this was a very satisfying action-comedy flick.  The fight scenes and big money stunts were awesome and the comedic chemistry between Rock and Stifler was top-notch (monkeys and paralyzing beans anyone?).  The Rock's billing as the "2nd Coming of Schwarzenegger" is pretty well justified by this film.  The story wasn't the best but I seriously doubt anyone's checking this film out for a good story.  You're watching this to see some bad guys get their butts kicked and this film definitely delivers.<p>BEST SCENES:<p>1. The Capoeira Fight<p>2. Monkey Troubles<p>3. The South America Bar Fight<p>4. The Paralysis scene<p>5. The Whip Fight<p>6. The Final Battle<p>THE DVD EXTRAS:<p>As is common among most DVD releases nowadays we've got a truckload of extras on this DVD.  Here's what you've got:<p>1. Commentary track with Director Peter Berg and The Rock<p>2. Commentary track by Producers Kevin Misher and Marc Abraham<p>3. "Rumble in the Jungle" - 10 minute featurette on fight and stunt training<p>4. "The Amazons - Hawaii Style" - 5 ? minute featurette on filming in a Hawaiian rain forest<p>5. "Apetite for Destruction" - 8 ? minute featurette on filming the big scenes including the falling water tower and cattle stampede<p>6. "The Rundown Uncensored" - 5 ? minute featurette on the stunt monkeys<p>7. "Running Down the Town" - 4 minute featurette about the construction of the "Brazilian Town" set<p>8. "Walken's World" - 5 ? minute featurette look into the world of the main villain Hatcher<p>9. 8 deleted scenes<p>10. Cast and Filmmaker Bios<p>THE VERDICT:<p>Overall, with the strong action sequences, the hilarious interplay with Rock and Stifler and backed by a truckload of extras, "The Rundown" is a definite recommendation whether you want to purchase the DVD or simply just chill with it for a weekend rental.<p>THE GRADES:<p>The Movie:  4 stars<br />The Extras:  5 stars<br />Overall:  4.5 stars<p>Highest Recommendation</p></body></html>

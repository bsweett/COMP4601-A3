Jack gives a good performance, he does crazy very well.  Its got some pretty funny things like the fishing trip, and when they get drunk.  Its pretty sad at the end but chief had to do it or Jack would have been a vegetable for the rest of his life.  The shining is better though.  7 out of a 10.</p></body></html>

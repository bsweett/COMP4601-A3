<meta name="summary" content="High Action... Weak Story"></head><body><p>You want a quick assessment? Here it goes. AvP doesn't measure up to the original Predator movie or the first two Alien films. While it works as a mindless action/thriller it completely fails to make the grade on the story level and the continuity level. Essentially what you have is a good looking package with little depth behind it. So if that's your think knock yourself out. I prefer something more.<br /><br />I don't know what it is with director Paul Anderson. He either has some good idea that ends up not following through completely or he has a not so good idea that turns out not so bad, but still doesn't really make the grade. AvP is no different. While the concept of Predators and Aliens battling out is very cool the way Anderson does it isn't. The idea was first conceived in a comic book by Dark Horse and then hinted at in a brief cameo shot on Predator 2. While this movie does borrow a mess of ideas from these the end result is still weak. The premise of Predators hunting Aliens as a rite of passage is a good idea, even if borrowed from the comic book and the whole Weyland tie in is interesting as well. So I'll admit props to those. The rest of it is tripe.<br /><br />Essentially the movie is half-baked. The whole origin of the mysterious pyramid in the Antarctic was not only laughable but also technically impossible. The reasons for the pyramid being there is even more ridiculous. While the characters are diverse and interesting nothing is really done with them, thus making them rather useless. The potential for character development was great but it never happened. The cast was very good yet they were hardly used effectively. Don't even get me started on how painfully little they did with a talent like Lance Henrickson. The continuity with previous movies is rather dubious. For instance the whole incubation period for the aliens seems a LOT shorter with aliens popping out of chests in about an hour instead of days. Also the Predators (save for one) seem to be painfully lacking in any hunting skills as they get picked off as easily as the humans. It's as if this was a clan of accountants or something. Rite of passage or not, you got to be at least good enough to take on the prey.<br /><br />So the story and character development are bad and there are plot holes that challenge Alien 3 on how major they are. The action and suspense aspects of the movie, however, are very impressive. You might find yourself at the edge of your seat at times with much of the action scenes. The special effects are also on the high quality level with nice animatronics, sets, and computer effects. The only special effects that I feel fall flat were the make-up and animatronics for the Predator's face. It just didn't look good compared to the previous movies, which seems strange since we're looking at over 15 years of technological advancements compared to the original films. Did I mention a stellar cast of relative unknowns that I hope I see more of in the future?<br /><br />This movie could have been so much better if more thought was put into it, but since that's not the case it's left to being weak. So if you're a stickler for continuity in the Alien and Predator universes you probably will find plenty to not like in this movie. However if you just want some mindless mayhem with cool effects then Alien vs. Predator will probably deliver the goods for you. If you want a good story you're not going to get one here. At best you will get a serviceable script that moves you through the action, but no depth whatsoever. Aliens vs. Predator is a somewhat sad take on what could have potentially be a fantastic merge of franchises.</p></body></html>

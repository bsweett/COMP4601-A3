<meta name="summary" content="&quot;I hate every ape I see / From chimpan-A to chimpan-Z&quot;"></head><body><p>I am a Tim Burton fan, although his standard practice of sacrificing a good story for good visuals gets on my nerves.  That wasn't the problem with this movie, though.  Well, at least not the main problem.  The problem here, and it's the same problem he ran head-on into with the dreadful "Mars Attacks", is that he's trying to make a campy and kitschy homage.  But you can't intentionally concoct camp and kitsch; they are unintentionally and organically grown from the best of intentions.  And they are especially undermined by a plus size budget.<p>Witness the references and gimmicks he throws at the screen, hoping for a knowing chuckle from an aware audience: an ape yells "Take your stinking hands off me you damn dirty *human*"; Charlton Heston makes a cameo and cries "damn them all... damn them all to hell" again, only this time he's an ape; and a twist ending utilizes a famous landmark for shock value.  Taken out of context, these all seem like damn good ideas.  But when they're the screenwriters' only good ideas, how much weight can they really carry?  Not much, I'd say. <p>My hope going in was that Burton would at least do a fine job creating a contained world, one that we'd never seen before.  Well, I'd seen it before... in the first "Apes" movie.  Sure, there are more vines on the walls, and most of the scenes in "Ape City" are filmed during dusk or night hours instead of under harsh sunlight, but the basic pod-like structure of the city was too familiar to give any credit to Burton and his production designers.  As for the apes themselves, most of the time their make-up looked magnificent.  Each character had his/her own distinctive face with a budding personality.  Unfortunately, when shot in close-up the make-up tends to look fake, and not nearly enough attention was paid to the women's make-up as the men's.  Also, the nature of the apes' social interactions could have been explored further.  The film touches on this subject, showing apes quietly grooming each other, or displaying their position in the pecking order with solid punches.  But anyone who's read Will Self's satire "Great Apes" (which borrows its central idea from the original "Planet of the Apes") will know that there was a whole spectrum of actions that could have been shown, but sadly weren't.<p>The most grievous error, to my mind, is the fact that Burton had a wonderful cast of actors to work with (I count at least four Oscar nominations in the group), and barely a single, well-defined character to offer them.<p>Helena Bonham Carter gets the most to do.  Her Ari, a senator's daughter, is the vocal conscience of the film, aghast at the second-class treatment humans get.  She is intelligent (or at least relative to her company), passionate, and strong-willed.  Carter also manages to wring some sex appeal from Ari, with either a lingering glance or a gentle nod of the head.  Too bad her subtle advances towards astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) are never reciprocated.  Wahlberg, an actor who I usually like, is as bland as white bread here.  He is nothing more than a talk-softly-and-carry-a-big-stick macho guy.  I can't remember Leo ever stringing two or more sentences together.  He is vaguely heroic, patriotic, stubborn, and simple-minded.  These attributes could have worked -- the innocent thrust into a fantastic situation -- but Leo is supposed to be a complicated man with complicated problems; too bad he isn't.  If Wahlberg as Leo gets to play three different colors here -- red, white, and blue -- then Tim Roth as General Thade gets only one: blood red.  Roth is a fantastic actor, limited to constant anger here.  Thade is never allowed to show any humanity (or, rather, chimpanity).  He's stuck in fourth gear for the entire picture.  And frankly, I didn't find him that menacing.  Michael Clarke Duncan pulls off his big and burly silverback gorilla quite well, although it's more of a physical role than an emotional one.  Estella Warren is really just around for eye-candy (she has wonderfully pouty lips, and appears to have an endless supply of lipstick!).  It's one of the most inconsequential roles I've seen in years.  Paul Giamatti, as a human slave-trader, is dirty, grimy, quite real, and terribly funny.  He seems to be the only member of the cast (besides possibly Roth) who understands how to perform facial expressions under his make-up.  He needed more screen time, if only to help break up the monotony.<p>As the story winds down to its inevitable big-bang conclusion, things get a little muddled.  The explanation of the apes' origin was handled quite well; it's the one plot point that the filmmaker's appear to have thought through, and nearly duplicates the surprise end of the original "Apes" movie.  But then, we are treated to a ludicrously hokey `deux es machinas' conclusion to the final battle.  And from there, it's only a hop, skip, and a jump to the incredibly illogical conclusion, which is just shock-value for the sake of shock-value, and a bold-faced lie.  The filmmakers show the audience one thing, and then expect them to believe another.  It just can't happen the way it does.  If anyone can explain to me why it can, please do.  Otherwise, I will continue to be angered by the deception.  And resentful of the memory of this shoddy movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="OK but flawed film"></head><body><p>"Shutter Island" is a mystery with a twist, and I don't want to give it away.  So, I won't go into a lot of detail about the plot.  Leonardo DiCaprio and his partner travel to an institution for the criminally insane on an island, and nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />As my wife put it, about 60 minutes in, you know it's going down one of a few paths, all of which are cliches.  Sure enough, an hour and 15 minutes later, she was proved right.  The problem with the twist ending in the 21st century is that we've all seen a ton of movies with twist endings, and it has become harder and harder to actually surprise the audience.  Also as my wife put it, there's a good movie buried in here somewhere.  The characters are interesting; the idea of a mental hospital at the dawn of modern psychiatry is interesting; and the location is fantastic.  Strip away about 30 minutes from this languidly-paced film, do a few more drafts of the script, and this could be a winner.  The way Hollywood works, the remake/reimagining in 2030 will win an Oscar.<br /><br />On the plus side, DiCaprio turns in a tour de force performance, as usual.  The guy is a fantastic actor, and this is an actor's film.  If you like watching a great actor do amazing things with a character, you will enjoy this movie.<br /><br />At best, "Shutter Island" is worth a rent.</p></body></html>

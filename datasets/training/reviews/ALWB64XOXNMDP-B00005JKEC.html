<meta name="summary" content="unexpectedly good movie"></head><body><p>I thought this was going to be a by the numbers thriller.  Wrong on all counts.  It shows the dark side of police work.  I can see how good career vetrans can go bad. The only good companion to this film would be Treat Williams "Prince of the City". That one shows what happens when a officer turns in his partners.  Like "Prince in the City" it offers an uncompromised look at the way incidents are covered up.  That is why this one got the Academy Award.</p></body></html>

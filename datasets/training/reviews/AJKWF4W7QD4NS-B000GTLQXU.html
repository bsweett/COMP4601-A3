The director of Troy, Das Boot, and The Perfect Storm re-works the 70's classic with some incredible tools at his disposal, as well as a potential-laced cast (Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfus, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barret, Andre Braugher, Freddy Rodriguez, and Kevin Dillon), but alas, Poseidon ends up being the mega budget, mainstream, brainless, disaster flick that you probably think it is.  The script does absolutely nothing to make the viewer feel any kind of sympathy or attachment to the characters, let alone care what happens to any of them as they all fight to survive when the state of the art, luxury ship capsizes after being hit by a massive wave.  Despite the incredible looking CGI effects and some great, old fashioned stunt work, Poseidon ultimately falls flat in the department that could have made it something truly special: character development.  It's not incredibly bad by any means, and definitely worth seeing for rainy day or brainless entertainment, but in any other case besides, you won't miss anything if you never see Poseidon.</p></body></html>

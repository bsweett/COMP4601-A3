<meta name="summary" content="This film raises the question: does God "need" prayers?"></head><body><p>Since the many other reviews addressed the drama of the film, I will address another question. The clash between the gods and the humans, according to this film, was caused by the gods noticing that the humans stopped praying to them. The gods created the humans so that they would pray to them, and they need the prayers. The prayers make them stonger.<br /><br />The pagans offered many reasons why the gods created humans. One, for example, was that they needed slave labor. But this tale says that the gods needed prayers. What do we think today? Does God need prayers?<br /><br />Most people today would reject this notion. God, they would say, is perfect and needs nothing. Then why pray? Prayer, they say, helps humans in various ways.<br /><br />Yet, people will be surprised to learn that not only some ancient pagans thought that God needs prayers, but there were and are Christians, Muslim, and Jews that thought and think so as well.</p></body></html>

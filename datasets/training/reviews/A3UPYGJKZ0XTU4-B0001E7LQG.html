<meta name="summary" content="Cluttered & Too Long, but Charming & Hilarious Nonetheless."></head><body><p>Harry (Jack Nicholson) and his much younger girlfriend Marin (Amanda Peet) plan to spend a romantic weekend at Marin's family home in the Hamptons. But their plans go awry when Marin's mother Erica (Diane Keaton) and her aunt Zoe (Frances McDormand) show up unexpectedly. The couple is further foiled when Harry has a heart attack in Marin's arms. As Harry is unfit to travel, Erica reluctantly allows him to stay in her home while he recuperates.  Erica, who is an accomplished playwright and 50-something divorcee, and Harry, an aging confirmed bachelor who has always confined his romantic aspirations to women half Erica's age, find themselves both attracted to and repulsed by one another. And the friction between them may ignite an unexpected spark.<p>Let me first say that "Something's Gotta Give" elicited more laughs in the movie theater than any film in my memory. It's a good time at the movies. It's too bad that the movie runs too long and doesn't maintain its charm through the third act. It would be nice if the audience could leave the theater in as good a mood as they experienced for the first two-thirds of the movie. At about 2 hours long, "Something's Gotta Give" is too long for a romantic comedy. It has a few subplots and a few acts too many. The film is charming enough and paced well enough to overcome it, but a tighter script would have done wonders. And although most of the film is hilarious, it loses a lot of its charm and humor after the action moves from the Hamptons to New York city. <p>The comedy and romance in "Something's Gotta Give" are, of course, derived from the notion that women of a certain age have a terrible time finding suitable men because the desirable men in that demographic date much-younger women. That's funny stuff, but it often seems like writer/director Nancy Meyers is trying to do more than entertain. She waves the older-women-can't-get-dates and older-men-who-date-younger-women-are-scum flags a little too high. And the repeated assertion that both old and young women are somehow victims of these aging Casanovas is insulting and, dare I say, inaccurate. This is a comedy; why not simply see the humor in the situation? It would be fine if the film said nothing. But mixed messages are a nuisance. Harry is chided for constantly cavorting with younger women, while Erica is congratulated when she does approximately the same thing.  And why are these people so preoccupied with the age of their mates anyway? It's tiresome.<p>"Something's Gotta Give" is undeniably funny but far from perfect. Erica's neuroses wear thin after a while. Harry is lovable when he's  lecherous, but trying when he's earnest. The film is too long. I didn't for a moment believe that Harry and Erica were actually compatible, but romantic comedies are contrived by definition. But ultimately a comedy is required only to be funny in order to succeed. And two thirds of "Something's Gotta Give" is laugh-out-loud funny. Jack Nicholson deserves a lot of credit for being willing to look like a fool -and an old fool at that. There's some terrific physical comedy. I like the decision to use brief nudity  for comic effect. And Keanu Reeves does a nice job as a very handsome doctor who pursues Erica. It would have been better if some of the clutter had been cleared out, but smart writing and no-holds-barred performances make "Something's Gotta Give" a funny and enjoyable film for just about everyone.</p></body></html>

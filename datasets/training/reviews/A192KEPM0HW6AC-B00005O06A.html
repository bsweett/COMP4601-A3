In the scene in which Kane goes after political boss Jim W. Geddes, he just stops on the stair landing -- it would have been a lot cooler if he pushed him down the stairs.<p>There's very little action in this movie, just a lot of talk, talk, talk about Kane. There's sort of a plot, which is about finding out what &quot;Rosebud&quot; means. Then, at the end of the movie, you only find out it's his sled. Huh? I watched two hours of this tedious and pretentious nonsense to find out he misses his sled?<p>Save your hard-earned money, and watch &quot;The Matrix: Reloaded&quot; instead!</p></body></html>

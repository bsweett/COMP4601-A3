<meta name="summary" content="Holds up very well"></head><body><p>Set in 1929, filmed in 1959, "Some Like It Hot" holds up surprisingly well nearly a half century after it was released. It's totally unbelievable, of course, but Curtis, Lemmon and Monroe all do a bang-up job in their roles and the result is an entertaining farce with a lot of memorable moments.  Although there's a fair amount of sexual innuendo for a 1959 movie, it's very mild by today's standards and "Some Like It Hot" is suitable for viewers of any age 10 and up.  The b/w print on this latest DVD release is crystal clear.  Definitely worth viewing.</p></body></html>

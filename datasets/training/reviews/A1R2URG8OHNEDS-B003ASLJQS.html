I'll tell you why. Because this movie was just so amazing and so great, that I want to explain to you in details what made it like that. My initial thoughts about this film, before I went to see it, would be that I would either think it was incredible and possibly one of the best films of the year, or it would be a terrible waste of time, money, and talent. I was glad that I was wrong about the latter. <p>Although "Mystic River" was not the best movie of the year, it will most positively be in the top ten, if not five, top twenty five movies of the year 2003. This is a movie on the list of this years classics of "Matchstick Men," "Open Range," "Chicago," "Adaptation," and many more. It's a thriller with just enough action to satisfy that group of people, just enough suspense to satisfy the people who are looking for that, and just enough drama to sadden the veiwer to the point where they just have to make sure the end of the movie has resolution, while more suspense is being thrown out. This movie had better suspense and a better storyline then most dramatic thrillers out there now. It sounds a little like "In the Cut," without all the sex. "Mystic River," was only rated R for it's profanity and some scenes of violence.<p>The ensamble cast was terrific. The main character probally is Jimmy Markum, who has the most conflict. His nineteen year old daughter Katie was murdered by the unknown. He sets it upon himself to find the guy who did it, and then kill him. But this is way ahead of myself. It begins with Jimmy and his friends Dave and Sean, all as kids. Writing their name is wet cement is one thing, but when two men posing as cops yell at them is another. Because they take Dave, claiming to bring him to his mother's house for ruining wet cement. Dave is missing for four days and when they catch the pedofiles, Dave becomes a little messed up. An unknown amount of years later pass and we see all of them grown up. Jimmy is Sean Pean, Dave is Tim Robbins, and Sean is Kevin Bacon. Jimmy is married to Annabeth, with a criminal record in his past, Sean is a policemen working with his partner Whitey, and Dave....well Dave is messed up. Married to Celeste and with a kid, he is still crazy about when he was abducted many years back. Jimmy's daughter Katie is killed. Sean and Whitey are the detectives who try to find out who did it. The three of them all reunite, from the abduction which seprated them apart from each other. They have their own lives, and their own secrets. <p>Celeste becomes a little confused about Dave. The night of Katie's murder, Dave came home in the middle of the night, blood covering his chest. He claims he beat up a mugger and killed him, but Celeste never finds anything about a dead mugger in the newspaper, AND Dave's story rapidily changes as the movie continues. Plus the viewer knows for a fact that Dave saw Katie when she was murdered, so Dave becomes the prime suspect in the investigation. Things begin to change, and revolations are told that begin to shift gears, all to the explosive conclusion that I seriosuly did not figure out. Crafty Clint Eastwood directs a mind boggler of a picture, what a guy!<p>The lighting of the movie gave off a dark, dismal, look on life. It made me think. It scared me, moved me, interested me, and wanted it to not end. No storng violence is present, mostly implied, by the profanity is a little strong. I look forward to reading the book. <p>I loved "Mystic River." I loved everything about it. The storyline that although is present in many movies that I have seen, is incredible. The acting plays off from the storyline strongly, making the movie oddly depressing, when in the end the message is hope. You hope for everything to end up alright, you hope for all of these sick people to stop taking young children, you hope to stop the murders, and you hope of stop the violence and the everlasting battles between bad guy and good guy. What a movie! I loved it! Definintly one of the best films of the year, and one of the best films that I have seen. See "Mystic River" now! A movie to see in the theatre, a movie to buy on video.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for language and violence.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Engrossing even the second time"></head><body><p>This is a movie that's hard to "like," but it certainly got my attention. Mike Nichols puts these four superb actors in a closed world, and explores the permutations of lust (and perhaps love), trust (and betrayal), forgiveness (and suspicion). Nichols sets up the characters and then tears them down--the predator Dan becomes the begging needy man as Alice (Natalie Portman) finally catches on to him; the cool, sophisticated, in-control Anna (Julia Roberts) becomes a woman who could have it all but doesn't want to be happy; and the rough-around-the-edges Clive Owen reveals himself as perhaps the most manipulative of all. There are parts of the film that don't quite ring true--how would you feel if you were picked up at a museum by a guy who does you-know-what in chat rooms? Anna doesn't seem to mind. But some things were all too true, such as the guys' reactions to infidelity, their insane focus on the gory details of the sex act without for a minute asking--What does this mean? We don't see anyone actually in bed, but that doesn't matter in this intensely sexual, at times raunchy film. As you see from the reviews, this movie excites strong reactions, and for that alone it's worth checking out.</p></body></html>

But if the intent was to create a fantastic sexy sci-fi adventure that's equal parts genuine comedy (actually greatly superior to much of the humor in movies billed under the comedy genre) and roller-coaster action thrills - owing as much to "Back to The Future", "Indiana Jones" and the less serious, more light-hearted James Bond adventures as to "T2" or "Total Recall" then it's succeededed smashingly.<br /><br />  In the futre, an entity called Evil has returned to Earth as it's apparantly done periodically, to try and gain control of something called the "Fifth Element" in order to wipe out life on Earth.  It falls to flying-cab driver Bruce Willis (in what I feel is his best role outside of an M. Night Shymalan film.  Yes, even better than John McClane in the first "Die Hard") to protect a strange, possibly alien girl named Leeloo (quirkily and lovably played by the scorching-hot Milla Jovovich of "Resident Evil" fame) who apparantly holds some kind of key to this Fifth Element.  Also starring Gary Oldman as one of the villains, who you just can't go wrong with.  With performances in movies like this, "Jesus", "Batman Begins" and "Bram Stoker's Dracula" under his belt I really think Oldman has proven himself as one of the world's greatest actors, and he's in top form here.<br /><br />  Innovative, dazzling visuals, larger-than-life action, great chases, perfectly placed comedy and Leeloo's penchant for quickly changing outfits wherever she happens to be at the moment - plus some surprisingly dramatic moments occasionally - combine to help make "The Fifth Element" an all-out winner.</p></body></html>

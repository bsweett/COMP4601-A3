<meta name="summary" content="When "Gold-Titanium Alloy" Man is just too long a name"></head><body><p>Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr) is a playboy genius whose passion is making things that go boom, day or night<br />2. Behind the successful billionaire is a pretty woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) showing off her organizational skills<br />3. During a product demonstration in Afghanistan, Stark is kidnapped by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings, sustaining serious injuries<br />4. Ten Rings wants to rule them all, and they want Stark to forge them the one weapon that can do it*<br />5. Working in the darkness where the shadows lie* Stark and Dr. Yinsen (a fellow prisoner who patched him up) pull a switcheroo and build a full metal power suit with a flame thrower and missile launcher.<br />6. The Ten Rings are left to pick up the pieces<br />7. Stark has a new corporate vision which gets a stormy reception from his partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) and the Board of Directors.<br />8. He fashions himself a new and improved armored suit, with all the trimmings, bells and whistles, plus the obligatory arc reactor which is the heart of the design<br />9. With help from Pepper Potts (Paltrow) and Lt. Col. Rhodes (Terrence Howard), Stark suits up to battle the bad guys<br />10. Two sequels are planned<br /><br />The movie takes a while to get to the really cool stuff, and while I enjoyed the whole thing, my son didn't get into it until "suit time."  There's no denying that the finished suit is the coolest superhero costume ever, and I'm buying this on DVD just to watch the cybernetic Mark III suit morph, flex and create havoc and mass destruction<br /><br />Downey proves himself to be an excellent choice for the lead role, and although they are unable to steal his thunder, Bridges and Paltrow are pretty darned good themselves.  Howard doesn't have that much screen time, but maybe he'll get his moment in the sequels<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, May 11, 2008<br /><br />* One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,<br />One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them<br />In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<br />(Tolkien)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bourne Sequel Not Supreme"></head><body><p>After Bourne Identity which was terrific. I expected even better sequel. Sad to say. Not even so. First of all, Marie was killed after being shot accidentally while the intended victim was Bourne. Which quite frankly I didn't understand since. In the Bourne novels she is very much alive. But the sequel failed to explain how Bourne came to be. The plot in the movie had so many unexplained answers to questions that need answering. That it was more actionfest than movie. Keep Bourne Identity in your library not Supremacy.</p></body></html>

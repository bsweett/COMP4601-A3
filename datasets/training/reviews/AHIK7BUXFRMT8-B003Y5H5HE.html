<meta name="summary" content="An Entrancing Movie for the Young and the Young at Heart"></head><body><p>This movie was entrancing to me and bored my wife; yet another example that beauty is in the eyes (and ears) of the beholder. Hugo evoked memories of the excitement of being young, impressionable and filled with wonder at the mysterious parts that make things work, both animate and inanimate. The movie progresses at a rather slow but steady pace at the beginning that may put off those who are looking for action in their movies. To me it did an effective job of identifying and defining Hugo with all of his dreams and aspirations; I felt a kinship with him that reminded me of certain aspects of my childhood. Gradually the clues that are given in the early part of the movie are put together and the viewer begins to see how it all fits together.<br /><br />The movie is visually somewhat overwhelming in its level of detail on the screen; one gets the feeling that one needs to watch it again to finish seeing all of the amazing and fascinating things being shown. This movie will be a feast for many boys and those men who have not lost their boyish sense of wonder. The role of Hugo is convincingly played by Asa Butterfield and the other lead roles are well done by such seasoned actors as Ben Kingsley, Christopher Lee, and many others.<br /><br />The movie is just over two hours long and seems to proceed at a leisurely, introspective pace. I have not been young for a long time but it brought back memories of youth that took me back to the feelings of childhood. I recommend it highly.</p></body></html>

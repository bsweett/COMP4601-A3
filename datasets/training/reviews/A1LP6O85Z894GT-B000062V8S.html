<meta name="summary" content="A worthy edition to the franchise"></head><body><p>The Terminator films serve as the next evolution in the debate mankind has waged ever since the myth of Prometheus.  Technology&#65533;s good and evil status has haunted and perplexed us from the moment we stepped out of the caves. In the Terminator films, technology, given too much power, sends us all back into the darkened primordial soup.<p>Human fate is what we make it is of the great themes present in TERMINATOR 3: THE RISE OF THE MACHINES. The hope we are ultimately in control of our fate and our technology is one of the underpinning messages making the violent and seemingly nihilistic fantasies of the Terminator film saga work.<p>Granted this third helping of Arnold wrecking things reminds us that the novelty of the new has long worn off this brilliant and durable franchise. This is really a small nitpick for the third installment delivers the promised thrills, blazing guns and honest heartfelt humanity. TERMINATOR 3 also bravely allows itself to go into DR. STRANGELOVE territory with a downbeat ending that brazenly bucks Hollywood trends while simultaneously setting the audience up for another sequel.<p>Such is the great paradox of the Terminator saga. While these films have pushed the technology of filmmaking to new extremes, pallid imitators have forgotten the humanity at the core of narrative. Technology, as any proud Luddite can tell you, is a Pandora&#65533;s Box. Just remember at the bottom of the box lies the hope that mankind is wise enough not sacrifice itself at the throne of convenience and awe.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Drug-induced Wonderland."></head><body><p>Alice in Wonderland directed by Tim Burton is a colorful but somewhat chaotic tale. It would be nice if I could understand what the heck Johnny Depp was saying in this film? He mumbles every line, seriously! His physical comedy is what makes him a fan favorite but when he speaks, I can't stand to hear him. The real scene stealer of this film is newcomer, Mia Wasikowska who plays Alice - she brings a quiet but stubborn quality to the role and I just loved Anne Hathaway as the White Queen, she's a funny little thing! Alice in Wonderland is good but poorly developed, 3 stars for me.</p></body></html>

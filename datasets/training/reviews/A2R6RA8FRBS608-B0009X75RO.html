I don't know that I have ever seen such a gripping musical on film. The casting is perfect and the dancing is truly superlative. PLEASE get this film and explore the real and fantasy lives of Roxie Hart as portrayed by Zellweger. It won best picture and it deserved it. The special effects are not the most sophisticated you'll ever see; but no film is ever 110% flawless. It's a winner!</p></body></html>

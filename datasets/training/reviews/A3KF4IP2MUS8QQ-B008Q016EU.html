<meta name="summary" content="When bad movies happen to good TV shows"></head><body><p>I have always been a fan of Charlie's Angels, and I absolutely adore Drew Barrymore, but this movie is horrible.  I don't know how else to put it.  The script is inane, the acting is not very good, the dialogue is forced, some of the special effects don't seem very special to me, and the overall effect is that of a destructive parody of a TV show I hold in high nostalgic regard.  This story would not have been acceptable for the dismal final season of the TV series.  There's one decent twist to it, but the overall objective of the bad guys and the plan they hatch to achieve that end is fantastically ludicrous.  I can't half blame the actors and actresses for speaking their lines without feeling, often mechanically switching emotions at the drop of an invisible dime, because most of what they had to say was just plain silly.  The acting seems to be so forced at times that it looks to me like these actresses are not enjoying what they are doing at all.  The Angels I know and love would not forget their entire mission every time one of them saw a cute guy, nor would they engage in phone conversations in the middle of intense action.  I also can't for the life of me figure out why they kept the character of Bosley in this film.  David Doyle must be turning over in his grave in reaction to Bill Murray's portrayal of Bosley as a totally inept, helpless, unbelievably silly character.  The Bosley of old was no Superman, but this Bosley can barely add two and two.  And the infamous "Thin Man" is like some Hollywood 1930s character actor reject whose mannerisms are so exaggerated that I expected him to break his own arm just trying to light a cigarette.  Worst of all, however, was the inclusion of Tom Greene at his most annoying for two scenes as "the Chad."  <p>What about the special effects?  Even this part of the movie was ruined for me because the filmmakers tried to make all of the action look like what we saw in The Matrix.  Every good scene seems to be cursed with slow-motion visuals of impossible jumps, kicks, and other moves, followed up by the girls striking unnecessary martial arts poses.  There is one scene in particular, featuring Drew, that takes the special effects way too far without bothering to give us a clue as to how what happens actually happens.  I appreciate the hard work and training that Barrymore, Liu, and Diaz went through to prepare for their roles, but the whole thing came off as ridiculous in my eyes.  I have to mention the music here too.  I love the old vintage Angels theme, but in a couple of places I heard music that was obviously stolen from James Bond and, of all things, Godzilla.  Why?<p>I hate to be so tough on a movie I thought I would like, and I especially hate to criticize one of my favorite actresses in Drew Barrymore, but I have to be truthful here.  There are some explosions, which are nice, and that alone keeps me from giving this the dreaded one star, but I cannot possibly give it more than two stars, even taking into account all of the extras you get on the DVD.  To some degree, Charlie's Angels was a real breakthrough of sorts in the 1970s, showing that women can be just as smart and effective at catching bad guys as men; this movie betrays the empowering spirit of the original series, and I think that is rather a sad thing.</p></body></html>

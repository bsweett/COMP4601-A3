Here's why it matters:<br /><br />Two words: Hit-Girl.  Or maybe that's one word. Whatever.  Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) isn't just an equalizer, she's a cross between Stephanie from LazyTown and Robin from Batman.  Hit-Girl is a descendant of the same violent breed of superhero that has been beating villains up for decades, except that she's an 11-year-old girl.  More importantly, she's a female superhero that isn't overtly sexual.  She's the next step up from the Powerpuff Girls. I realized that true Girl Power had come to superhero movies when Hit-Girl punched a grown man in the face with brass knuckles.<br /><br />Being a superhero has consequences.  We are reminded that Hit-Girl is basically a sociopath who has never been to school.  Hit-Girl views life as a video game, a point reinforced in first-person perspective through her nightvision goggles as she shoots and stabs her way through piles of thugs. Her father Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) is a cold-blooded killer who will slit his opponents' throats. Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson) is so terrified of the mass slaughter the aforementioned "heroes" inflict that he vows to quit the superhero gig entirely.  It doesn't stick of course.<br /><br />It was a graphic novel FIRST. Graphic novels often trail movies, adding more detail that was left out.  Kick-Ass the comic was released before the movie, giving the entire plot away.  It doesn't seem to have harmed the film at all. Graphic novels may now become an official extension of movies as part of their development - storyboards and comic panels have a lot in common after all.<br /><br />Kick-Ass plays for keeps. Kick-Ass isn't so much realistic as it is gritty.  It dispenses with superhero tropes like superpowers and embraces the difficulties of secret identities, not having any powers, and getting hurt.  Kick-Ass gets so beaten up by an uncaring world that he lands in a hospital.  People die.  A lot.<br /><br />Part thoughtful meditation on the perils of our violence-drenched celebrity culture, part non-stop rollercoaster ride of every adolescent's superhero dreams, Kick-Ass is like one long movie trailer - all action without the boring parts. Kick-Ass is awesome, not because of just what it does but because of what it represents.  I patiently await a more PG-oriented version of Hit-Girl that will inspire little girls everywhere to play with superhero action figures.</p></body></html>

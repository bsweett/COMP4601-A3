<meta name="summary" content="Good movie,, but seems incomplete to be a great movie"></head><body><p>The Pursuit of Happyness has to be seen, cause its a real story about<br /><br />real people.  When Will Smith decided to tackle this one, we would hear<br /><br />many facts about  Chris Gardner and when i watched the movie anticipating<br /><br />what i heard, some things that should have been in the movie were not included in the movie. I did'nt mind that. But then they end the movie after seeing  Chris Gardner in hard times most of the movie,we dont get  the satisfaction to see any glimpse of him in happier time after<br /><br />succeeding at what he worked soo hard....hey we just wanted a few minutes, but they slapped on the end of the movie with a few words...<br /><br />Movie is a must .....but i find the quick ending a shot below the belt for<br /><br />us viewers.</p></body></html>

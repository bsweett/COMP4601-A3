<meta name="summary" content="Cute and often funny, but not worthy of a Best Pic nomination"></head><body><p>Yes, it's all very cute.  The neighborhoods, the people, the blue drinks, and so on--cute as heck and really adorable and sometimes funny. But believable?  No, not quite.<br /> I couldn't believe that Juno went back with Paulie at the end and that they sat there singing a happy song as if nothing serious had happened in their young lives.  It was hard to believe that Juno would actually make a phone call about getting an abortion and then scare herself off just because of the thought that the baby had fingernails already.  I couldn't believe that Juno's dad and stepmother were so cool with the whole thing.  That's not the normal reaction from most people in such a situation.<br /><br />The music got on my nerves as well.  Every five frakking minutes, there was another off-key indie song being sung.  It was quite annoying after a while.<br /><br />Was there a reason for Liberty Bell to be in the movie at all?  She was basically a piece of furniture.<br /><br />RE: the dialogue:  okay, sarcastic and self-aware and snappy is fun for a few minutes.  I'm sure it was fun to write.  But come on....do people talk that way that frequently?  I couldn't believe that either.<br /><br />Into the Wild deserved a nomination far more than this film did.</p></body></html>

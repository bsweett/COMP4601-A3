BUT STILL DEATH WISH! 4 1/2 STARS!"></head><body><p>Watching 'The Brave One' while being a very insightful character study, still ends up being another 'Death Wish'. Smarter perhaps, but it does bring us to the same place. The film does show the different phases of healing from a victim's point of view, but in the end, we still love to see these dirtballs get exterminated! Jodie Foster gives a wonderful performance and I really felt her anxiety and paranoia when she tries to re-enter the world she once knew. Although she seems to have no problem finding trouble after her attack, I guess it's not too far fetched as I'm sure there is plenty of it, if your looking for it.....trouble that is!</p></body></html>

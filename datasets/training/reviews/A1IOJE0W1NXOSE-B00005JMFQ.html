<meta name="summary" content="Not enough Hugh"></head><body><p>Somehow when I rent a DVD &quot;starring&quot; Hugh Grant, I expect to see a lot of Hugh Grant.  Silly me!  In this ensemble effort, he is in just a few scenes, playing the Prime Minister of England who is inexplicably attracted to a foul-mouthed female assistant.  If that's not enough, there's a couple starring in a porn film who are too shy to even kiss on their first date.  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this movie can't decide if it's concentrating on its R rating or trying to be a feel-good movie.  It tries to do both and doesn't succeed very well in either effort.</p></body></html>

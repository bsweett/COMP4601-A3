<meta name="summary" content="Flawed but still amazing masterpiece."></head><body><p>Road to Perdition is so ambitious that any flaws it may have are made irrelevant by the film's grandiosity of vision, technical brilliance, and unique sensibility.<p>Several members of the production team were carried over from American Beauty -- director Sam Mendes, legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall, brilliant composer Thomas Newman -- but the two films are apples and oranges.  What they do share is a sense of boldness, narrative voices that are unique and distinctive.<p>Hall's photography is once again superlative -- and the larger, more elegiac tone of this film allows him even more room to dazzle with his visual magic.  Thomas Newman's score is inscrutable, once again so intrinsically woven into the fabric of the film that it becomes a seamless part of the whole, enhancing the action rather than sticking out from it.<p>The acting as a whole is wonderful.  Paul Newman still has the ability to ignite the screen with a look; young actor Tyler Hoechlin is terrific as lead character Michael Sullivan, Jr., the gangster's son in danger of following his father's path; and Jude Law is fantastic and eccentric as psychotic hitman Maguire, opting for an engrossing low-key menace.  Tom Hanks is the weak link in the first half of the film; his character is not a well-defined one for a good 45 minutes, and his repressed performance doesn't help.  Fortunately he comes to life in Act 2 of the film with the first bank robbery.  A good thing, for the film's emotional impact hinges on him, and from this point on he acquits himself well.  However, I can't help but think an actor like Liam Neeson (remembering his powerhouse performance in Neil Jordan's Michael Collins) could have brought much more fire, volatility and charisma to this role.  Nonetheless, Hanks works well enough, even if he's one of the flawed elements.  There is a small number of scenes that last a little longer than they need to, as well, even though as a whole the film is quite well paced, and even when scenes run long, the eye-melting cinematography tends to keep you from becoming disengaged.<p>One of Road to Perdition's greatest strengths is that it is unlike any other gangster film in history.  While its themes have been touched upon by the Godfather series, its approach -- kind of a hybrid noir gangster/mismatched buddy/road movie -- is very original indeed.  Just for that, I'd recommend it as essential viewing.  And there is more to be discovered.</p></body></html>

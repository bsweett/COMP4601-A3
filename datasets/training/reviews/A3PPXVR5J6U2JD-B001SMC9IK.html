A science fiction classic that permanently embedded the catch phrase "klaatu barada nikto" into the geek lexicon, the first film was a parable about the Cold War.  Both the producer and director were criticized for the liberal themes of the film, which promoted world peace and a draw down of military hostilities. The "standing still" of the world was a reference to all electrical systems on Earth freezing for a half hour, with the exception of critical systems. In short, the movie's message was thought provoking, intended to begin a discussion about American policies.<br /><br />The remake is no different (spoiler alerts abound).  This new version features a hostile military led by Regina Jackson (the stalwart Kathy Bates), the monotone human-like alien (Keanu Reeves as Klaatu), an aggrieved scientist widow (the beautiful Jennifer Connelly) and her angry son (played by Jaden Smith).  This new version pokes viewers with a stick: the Benson patriarch died in Iraq; the president's response to an alien invasion is openly hostile; and the Message is no longer about the Cold War but Global Warming.  In other words: the movie's message is thought provoking, intended to begin a discussion about American policies.<br /><br />But is it a good movie?  Overall, the film bulks up special effects, smoothes over some of the rough edges from the original, and does its best to translate the original to modern sensibilities. GORT now stands for Genetically Organized Robot Technology, is a giant nanotechnology war machine, and the descending globes of light are arks to save the Earth.  The computer graphics are outstanding.<br /><br />The acting, not so much.  Reeves sleepwalks through his role, which, while not inappropriate, doesn't stretch his acting chops either.  Klaatu is suitably creepy as a blank-faced drone, but difficult to sympathize with as he becomes more human. Connelly has little to do besides plead at the camera with her eyes.  Smith comes off as recalcitrant and unlikable, a weakness in the child actor who represents the sum of humanity's relationship. The sole stand out is John Cleese as Professor Karl Barnhardt, projecting a level of warmth and kindness that's we rarely see on screen.  If I had to pick a person to argue for humanity's survival, Cleese would be an excellent choice.<br /><br />The ending feels sloppy.  GORT transforms from a giant robot (scary!) to a hissing swarm of metal locusts (biblical, but not as scary).  The biblical parallels continue with Klaatu's birth and sacrifice, but the film seems conflicted as to how to wrap things up.  The movie concludes with the Earth standing still, permanently - hospital machines and airplanes be damned.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with the movie's tenets is moot.  If you're nodding your head or rolling your eyes then this version, like the original before it, did its job. But in comparison, the original has better acting and a tighter plot.</p></body></html>

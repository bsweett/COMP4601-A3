<meta name="summary" content="Dear Sandra and Keanu..."></head><body><p>Dear Sandra and Keanu,<br /><br />I'm writing to you from the year 2008. As you're reading this in 2004, I know that probably sounds stupid. Two hours ago I didn't realize quite how stupid, but then I saw a movie called "The Lake House" in which you star. I hope that title means nothing to you yet, and that's how I'd like to keep it. That's why I'm writing to you tonight.<br /><br />Some time in 2005, representatives of Warner Bros, or perhaps even the great Argentine director Alejandro Agresti himself, will approach you with the script. Adapted from a successful Korean film called "Siworae", it will have been penned by Tony-winning writer David Auburn. But don't let that fool you. Don't be drawn in by the romance - it will be squandered on the screen. Suppress the desire for World Cinema credibility - it will not be attained. Sandra, you will be given a nice haircut, but will be forced to mope around endlessly talking to yourself and will have to confess to loving the smell of a dog's feet. Keanu, you will be given poorly-written scenes of familial angst, made to wear turtlenecks, and shot to look doughy and white.<br /><br />Say NO! I'm begging you! Let this material find its true cast and natural form. Say no, and set it free. Let the script float around Hollywood for a few more years. Let Carrie Fisher doctor it into a comedy. Let Warners hire Penny Marshall to direct Ren&eacute;e Zellweger and Greg Kinnear, while you guys go off and do what you do best - dramedies and speculative action/sci-fi - and wait for that serious, surprising film to come along that might finally take you to the Oscar podium. Because this certainly isn't it. Call the Coen brothers. Call Scorsese. At the very least, call Soderbergh or Clooney and see what Section Eight has on the slate - they always need quality ensembles and enjoy risky, against-type casting.<br /><br />I know this letter probably makes little sense. How can I change the past? Surely if I'm writing this, I saw the movie, which means you made it - heedless of my advice. But I'm hoping the idiotic time-shifting logic of the movie, in which actions in the future can change the bad things about the past without affecting any of the nice things in the present, will somehow hold. If I'm right, I'll be able to logon to Amazon tomorrow and find no trace of the DVD.<br /><br />Please take my advice. Please say no. Just let us all remember you together in "Speed", when you were both young and pretty and knew how to kiss.<br /><br />Fingers crossed,<br />Steve</p></body></html>

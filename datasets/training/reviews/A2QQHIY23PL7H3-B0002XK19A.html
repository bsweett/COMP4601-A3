<meta name="summary" content="A better film than the first, however..."></head><body><p>Spider-Man 2 is better than the original Spider-Man. I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one. However, I feel Spider-Man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade Spider-Man, it should naturally be better. That's what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be.<br /><br />Effects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train. Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina has more to work with as Doc Ock than Dafoe did as the Goblin, and humanizes what was once a wacky villain. James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high-caliber acting.<br /><br />But the script needs work. It uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot, that of the hero calling it quits. It's never convincing, and the film drags as we wait for Peter to realize things we've known all along. Character relationships, though well-acted, don't seem to have progressed since the first movie. We're still treading the Peter/Mary Jane love triangle, just with a different third wheel. Harry still has his on/off friendship with Peter. There are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end, but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one. For a story supposedly set 3 years later, it might as well have been 3 days.<br /><br />We get a dvd with good extras and audio/video presentation. I enjoy Spider-Man 2 on its own, and it's nice to have it in my dvd library, but as a sequel it's not fresh enough for me. Hopefully next year's Spider-Man 3 will fix that.</p></body></html>

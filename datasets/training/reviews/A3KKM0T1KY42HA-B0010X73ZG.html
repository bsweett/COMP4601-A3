<meta name="summary" content="From Beyond"></head><body><p>In 1920, H. P. Lovecraft wrote a short story called From Beyond about an alien environment inhabited by horrific creatures that overlaps with our own environment. Stephen King often gives credit to Lovecraft as inspiration for his Horror writings (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/042518160X">Stephen King's Danse Macabre</a>).<br /><br />Therefore, it's no surprise--and perhaps not a coincidence--that King wrote a story circa 1980 called The Mist that explores what might happen if a window to that alien environment was inadvertently opened...wide...releasing a dense mist filled with monsters. (The Mist was later published in one of King's collection of short stories called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451168615">Skeleton Crew</a> {1985}.)<br /><br />Fast forward to the late 2007 release of a feature film adaptation of The Mist. But what's really interesting is that the director of The Mist is the same guy that directed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002J4ZWS">The Shawshank Redemption</a>...Frank Darabont...so my expectations for The Mist were very high! (Darabont also directed King's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEWEDU">The Green Mile</a>.)<br /><br />And my high expectations were met in the film adaptation of The Mist...mostly. The story in the movie is very loyal to the book (as I remember anyway...I read it more than 20 years ago!): A monster infested mist descends on a small lakeside town, and we follow the perils of a group of townspeople trapped in a grocery store when the mist hits. On screen, some of the actions and decisions by the terrified captives are a little hard to grasp, and the movie has a truly haunting and affecting ending that was much more depressing than the book's. Otherwise, the story from the book seems completely intact.<br /><br />There's great suspense. Good acting. I was thoroughly entertained. And unlike too many film adaptations of King's Horror stuff...The Mist was very well done and preserved a lot of the prose, shock and character of the original story.<br /><br />Any Horror fan should enjoy The Mist, and any fan of King and the original story shouldn't miss this DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Awesome horror-comedy-fantasy movie, great DVD too!"></head><body><p>Elvis Prestley ( played by Bruce Campbell) lives in Mud Creek Texas rest home. He's aged and has a bad hip with mysterious growth on his winky, there has been some mysterious deaths and disapperences in the place as an ancient 3,000 Egyptian mummy named " Bubba Ho-Tep". He joins forces with an aging black man who calls himself John F. Kennedy ( Ossie Davis) to take on the dusty soul-draining cretin and send it back to hell where it came from.<br /><br />An amusing and funny independent movie that blends elements of horror, comedy, fantasy and parody with some original ideas, great low-budget special effects ( for instance, Bubba Ho-Tep himself), some weak acting ( hey it's a b-movie!), and it's a fun movie.<br /><br />The DVD is great with chockloads of extras such as two audio commentaries, featurettes, deleted scenes, trailer and more, weither you love or hate it, this movie is a must see and shall be a modern day cult masterpiece.</p></body></html>

But if you wanna see Kelly at his overall best buy this film.  Evryone knows the plot boy meets girl, girl disses boy, boy gets girl, problems with life and career and EVERYBODY SING!!  But it's the problem with life and career that gives Rain its snap.  it follows in the same vein as All About Eve as it attacks the film industry but it does so in an even nastier way-it mocks its own genre of film(musicals) to mock Hollywood. Kelly also co-directed this film to good affect but obviousily Donen was in charge.  All the actors are at their foot tappin best and O'Connor steals the film with his brain tattooing number &quot;Make 'em laugh&quot; Reyonlds to is a delight but at the time Kelly hated her and gave her hell on set(he felt she was a scene stealer). But the film is a classic and everytime he walks Reynolds home adn the opening to &quot;Signing In The Rain&quot; begins to swell the volume on my TV goes up and my face always lights up in amazement of the lyrics, Kelly's voice and his dancing.  this movie is a joy to watch and complete misery if you don't have it.</p></body></html>

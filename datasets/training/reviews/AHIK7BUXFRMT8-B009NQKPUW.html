<meta name="summary" content="A Must for the Alien Universe Fan"></head><body><p>I am a fan of the Alien universe series and knew I would have to watch and would probably wind up buying this one too. Well I saw it on opening day and found it to be a worthy addition to the franchise so I've pre-ordered the 3-D version and look forward to getting it when it becomes available. There are a number of unanswered questions the film leaves the viewer wondering about and I hope that I find some clues on my second viewing when the disc comes in.<br /><br />The movie itself is about a discovery which promises to reveal important information about the origins of man. An expedition is sent across space to try and uncover more truths about this discovery. What they find turns into a challenge for their survival as very unfriendly forces are unleashed which must be defeated or the crew from earth will all suffer death.<br /><br />The movie ends just as the story takes a new direction which is setting up the audience for a sequel. Should that one get made I'll probably get it too for my "Alien" collection. Although this story takes place in the familiar alien universe it is pre-Ripley and not directly related to the older movie, "Alien." The story line is similar in that a strong female personality survives adversity and an aberrant android with a hidden agenda complicates life for all of his unsuspecting shipmates.<br /><br />The movie was actually less violent than the previews of coming movies that were shown before "Prometheus" started. This is one of those sci-fi action flicks that are reasonably cerebral with sufficiently toned down violence to avoid running off the non-fan of the franchise.<br /><br />We found the movie satisfying and entertaining and I look forward to seeing it again. I recommend the movie for the fan of the franchise as well as general sci-fi action movies.</p></body></html>

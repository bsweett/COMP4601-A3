The movie was based on the actual death of Elizabeth Short. This murder is investigated by two hunky police detectives, played by studs Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart, who find their lives twisted and turned upside down as they try to find answers as to why anyone would want to kill a beautiful woman. Both will also not be satisfied until they find the culprit. Both Hilary Swank and Scarlett Johansson give outstanding supporting performances. There are over 40 minutes of bonus features that deal with the actual death of the Black Dahlia. Brian DePalma, the film's director, is interviewed. Unfortunately, the movie was both a critical and commercial failure</p></body></html>

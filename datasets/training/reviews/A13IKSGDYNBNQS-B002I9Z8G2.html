Its almost a direct continuation of the TNG episodes "The Best of Both Worlds" in which Jean Luc Picard is assimalated by the Borg.<br /><br />The story has been told by many other reviewers, so I will not repeat that. However, I will say that here you get an excellent story, which is well directed by Jonathan Frakes, and above all a marvellous leading performance by Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean Luc Picard.<br /><br />The 2nd disc contains hours and hours of extras which are well worth watching. You can see from the interviews on the extras disc the enthusiasm of all those involved in the making of the film.<br /><br />All the things that make, or have made, Star Trek such a long-standing success are contained in this film: The marvellous interaction of the characters and cast with each other. Decisions that affect the future of humanity, a moral quality which may ultimately be the way forward for us all, and as with all the best Star Trek films and TV shows time travel.<br /><br />Of course I realise that 'a moral quality' sounds horribly pretentious, and in reality this is just a film that will have no affect on mankinds future (or lack of it). So forget about that and watch a cracking film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Soderbergh Strikes Again."></head><body><p>Steven Soderbergh is on a roll. Last year he awed the movie industry with his double-whammy of ERIN BROCKOVICH and TRAFFIC, becoming one of only a slight few directors to ever be nominated Best Director for two different films in the same year. Now, Soderbergh strikes again with OCEAN'S ELEVEN.OCEAN'S ELEVEN is a classic heist movie, but updated with a post-modern sensibility. The story is simple, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is released from jail and immediately sets into motion a plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos. He meets up with an old pal and confidante (Brad Pitt) and the two form an ensemble team to pull off the heist. Ocean has personal reasons for this particular job, mainly to get his ex-wife (Julia Roberts) back from the malicious casino owner (Andy Garcia) who stole her.Clooney and Pitt have the bulk of the dialogue, but the ensemble cast also includes such stalwarts as Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner, and Don Cheadle. Each performer brings just the right nuances to their roles, and though most of these actors are stars by their own right, none break the unity of the ensemble cast and steal the show.OCEAN'S ELEVEN is engaging (I only looked at my watch once) and seems to be a better movie than the Rat Pack version from which it originated. In fact, the film seems more like THE STING or THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR than the original OCEAN'S ELEVEN.Though the plot is perdictable; you know almost from the start that Ocean is going to succeed in his scam; knowing that doesn't really take anything away from the movie. However, the suspense leading up to the heist could have been built up a little more. Also, there were a few elements that could have added to the actual suspense of the heist itself (the grease man gets his hand smashed in a door-that could have been used a little more e.g.).Overall OCEAN'S ELEVEN is an entertaining movie that is sure to bring Soderbergh and Clooney (one of the film's producers) more kudos and perhaps bring about more movies with all-star casts that don't cost much to make (the film was made for a relatively low $30 million). It's a nice piece of stimulating movie mind candy.</p></body></html>

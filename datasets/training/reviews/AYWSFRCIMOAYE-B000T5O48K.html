<meta name="summary" content="BAD .....to the core"></head><body><p>People in this movie just talked, talked and talked. From what I know, the word movie derives from "move". So, if all the actors did was talking, this should be called a stage play!<br /><br />The settings revealed this was a B movie with a shoestring budget. My attention worn out after watching it for 30 minutes. After that, the acting of the actors did not mattter any more. They just kept on talking. There's no suspense, no action. Most of the time, things were happening in only one room! What a waste of time and money!<br /><br />I enjoy atmospheric horror movie like The Grudge and The Ring but this movie is nothing like them.</p></body></html>

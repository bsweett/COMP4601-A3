<meta name="summary" content="OH NO, THE BOY !"></head><body><p>I seldom buy a DVD of a movie I've never seen and when I do, it's very rare I end of liking it but c'mon, a movie that keeps you surprised from the first scene to the last ? A movie in which the very best laugh (out of plenty) and the very biggest surprise (out of plenty too) is saved for the very last scene ?. I guess if you personify the film's punchline as character (the midget/dwarf) early on, and you make him interesting enough, the end result can be rather good.<br />IN BRUGES is the baseball equivalent of hitting for the fences, it could have easily stunk but instead they ended up hitting this one out of the ball park.<br />Certainly not for every taste but I loved it.</p></body></html>

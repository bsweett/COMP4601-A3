<meta name="summary" content="Star Trek II: Best of the Feature Film Series"></head><body><p>"Now, this is more like it!"<br />So wrote film critic Janet Maslin in June of 1982 when Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan opened nationwide.<br /> You see, even though millions of Star Trek fans had flocked to see Star Trek: The Motion Picture in December of 1979, the reaction was, shall we say, mixed. Oh, sure, fans were happy to see Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest of the crew back in action. Yes, the redesigned USS Enterprise was impressive, as were all the visuals. And that Jerry Goldsmith score was just fabulous.<br /> Yet, for all that, Star Trek I was also a big letdown. And even though the attempt of the producers to make an intelligent, non-Star Wars science fiction story was laudable, the first of the 10 feature films did not fire up the imagination. Wags, according to David Gerrold in his book The World of Star Trek, dubbed it Star Trek: The Motionless Picture and Spockalypse Now.<br /> However, Paramount's accountants and executives did see good, if not Star Wars-sized, box office rentals, and they decided to give the franchise another chance. So they called in Harve Bennett, a well-known television producer, and asked him to take over from Gene Roddenberry as executive producer for the next Star Trek feature film.<br /> Bennett took a look at most of the 79 Star Trek television episodes, seeking the formula that would make a second Star Trek movie soar and take audiences where "no one had gone before." Yet, ironically, the concept Bennett and co-writer Jack Sowards came up with was to make a sequel not to the first film, but to an episode which aired in 1967 "Space Seed."<br /> In another brilliant stroke, Nicholas Meyer was hired to direct. New to the Star Trek universe, Meyer decided to start over almost as if the first feature did not exist. Although he would use stock footage from Star Trek I (which saved the studio tons of money), there would be new costumes, a new approach, and even a new score by James Horner.<br /> Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (originally titled The Undiscovered Country, a Shakespearean reference to death) is a Horatio Hornblower-like story of Admiral Kirk's midlife crisis - at 52, he is now a flag officer and faculty member at Starfleet Academy in 23rd Century San Francisco. Unhappy at his desk job, he longs for command of a starship. His former ship, the Enterprise, is now a training ship commanded by his former first officer, Captain Spock.<br /> It is also the story of Khan Noonian Singh, a tyrant from the late 20th Century who fled from Earth in the year 1996 after the Eugenics Wars (funny, we must have missed those on Fox or MSNBC) and was found by Kirk and Co. in the 2260s aboard SS Botany Bay, a sleeper ship. Revived - in one of those well-meant gestures by our heroes, Khan reverted to type and tried to take over the Enterprise. Only the triumvirate of Kirk, Spock and McCoy enabled the Enterprise to resist Khan and his followers, and he - along with Lt. Marla McGivers and his band of "supermen" - was exiled on Ceti Alpha VI.<br /> Alas! For one of the neighboring planets exploded six months after Khan's exile, and the result was catastrophic. Khan's world was laid waste, and many of his people, including Lt. McGivers, died. And for 15 years, Khan bided his time, until a Federation starship on an unrelated mission arrives.<br /> Star Trek II then becomes a classic revenge tale as Khan takes over the USS Reliant and battles Kirk for possession of the Genesis Device, a missile which can reconfigure entire planets. Starships duel, explosions flare up on screen, chaos ensues. Khan, of course, is thwarted, but not without great cost.<br /> Of course, 21 years after the fact, we know Spock gets killed. We know, also, that this movie started a story arc that continued with The Search for Spock and The Voyage Home and that, at least for Spock, death is only temporary.<br /> The Director's Edition of Star Trek II is subtly different from the theatrical and first - barebones - DVD versions. The story is the same....but this is the slightly longer edition seen originally in its ABC-TV network broadcast premiere in 1984. In this version we find out that the engineering cadet Peter Preston is Scotty's nephew. There are also bits of dialogue that are changed slightly, and some shots presented differently. There is also a great Director's commentary from Nick Meyer. He is a great speaker and very witty, at that. The text commentary by Mike and Denise Okuda is also informative and sometimes even funny. As in all DVDs with extra features discs, there are trailers, featurettes, and interviews with cast and crew.</p></body></html>

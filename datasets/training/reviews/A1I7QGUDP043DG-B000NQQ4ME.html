This is an extraordinary tale that churns with love, fear and the fight to survive. Based on historic civilizations, it takes us through the journey of an Indian (Rudy Youngblood) captured from his peaceful tribe and taken with his friends to the brutal Kingdom of the Mayans where they are to be sacrificed. But sometimes love is stronger than hate, and Jaguar Paw puts his terror aside to get back to his pregnant wife and child hidden in an empty well in his village. Will he reach her before it rains and the dry well floods? There is scene after scene of great action and acting (too many to count). Gibson and Farhad Safinia are an excellent team and have made a very powerful film!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

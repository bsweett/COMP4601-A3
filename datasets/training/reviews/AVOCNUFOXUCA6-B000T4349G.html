<meta name="summary" content="A 90-minute episode of the Twilight Zone"></head><body><p>Going into this movie, one has to expect it to be some kind of sci-fi or horror movie, and it certainly is.  It's essentially an episode of the Twilight Zone, stretched into a long and tedious movie.  Stripped of filler and reduced to its essentials, this actually could have been an excellent 30-minute TV segment.  There are some interesting ideas in here.  Sadly, as a movie it fails to engage the viewer's interest to any degree.  It's no wonder this movie seems like little more than a long television episode; virtually all of the screenwriter's previous credits are for television material.  Even the direction seems more like TV direction than movie direction.<br /><br />A big problem with this movie is its lack of internal logic.  In any sci-fi or horror movie or book, the events and actions may be as fantastic or unreal as the creators wish, but the audience can only suspend its disbelief if the story hews to some kind of internal logic.  The story must make sense in terms of the ground rules it sets up for itself.  Sadly, toward the end of this movie, any pretense of internal logic goes right through the roof, and the audience is left scratching its head about what exactly went on.<br /><br />The performances are not to blame for the flaws of this film, which is why I give it two stars instead of one; the cast valiantly does its best with the material given to them.<br /><br />This isn't an awful movie; you won't be throwing things at your TV wishing you had 2 hours of your life back after it's over.  But you may find that by the time the movie is over, you've started to do your bills, or make a snack, and not quite realize it's over.  You won't be inclined to go back and see what you missed.</p></body></html>

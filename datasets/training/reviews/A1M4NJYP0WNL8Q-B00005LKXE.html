At that time I felt it was a let down from &quot;Silence of Lambs.&quot;  While it was quite readable it lacked some fundamental level of excitement.  Because of that I did not go see the film when it was first released.  Now I find myself having mixed reactions to the DVD release, and for reasons almost the exact opposite of those I held against the book.<p>Don't get me wrong.  The film is really much better than the book.  The casting of Hopkins and Julianne as Lector and Starling is perfect.  The script is riveting and all the other qualities are almost too good.  In fact I would be tempted to give this every star possible except for one thing.  Ridley Scott, as director, has chosen to base the film on the book, but he deviates from the novel at several key points.  Scott himself admits that he was trying for a new interpretation of Lector the anti-hero.  <p>Viewers will have to decide whether this is an issue for them.  It didn't really bother me until the ending itself, which is simply not what writer Tom Harris has intended.  I felt it was completely out of character with the rest of the film as well.  It is clear from Scott's commentaries on the film that this ending is exactly what he wanted.  Oddly enough, the extra material includes an alternative ending which I think is much better, even if it doesn't follow the book either.<p>What's good?  Almost everything else.  I've already mentioned the great acting, but what really makes the film is the great cinematography and a mindboggling score.  Right from the beginning you are confronted with a film too serene and beautiful to be a simple horror movie.  It has a lean and solemn poetry that, perhaps, gives us a glimpse into Lector's own mind.  From out of the most nerve-wracking of pieces and fragments Scott has created a romance that has no physical components - a tragicomedy where we expected a horror film.<p>Despite of my dislike for the ending I still would label this film a must see.  The Special Edition includes omitted scenes and trailers, Multi-Angle Vignettes, a series of 'the making of...' discussions and all the other paraphernalia of the gimmick overladen DVD issue.  Two discs of shivers and fun.</p></body></html>

For instance, both films cut right into the story with little background, and the two films end just as precipitously.<br /><br />However, there are some differences to be sure.  For instance, while in the first film the zombies are restricted to Umbrella Corp.'s compound, in the second these mutants overwhelm all of Raccoon City.  In addition, while the first focused on twisting plot development, with little truly exciting action, the second tries to, somewhat successfully, turn this around with the main characters fighting the mutants from the start.<br /><br />Oh yeah, also while at the end of the first film, we see a guy ripped away to be used for some experiment and we the audience actually are upset; but, in the second film the tenderness for this man-turned-mutant is never developed enough for us to care, and I mean at all.<br /><br />Other then that, the two really are just the same poor fare.  Both of which clearly made for, or from, the video game realm, because the story translates poorly to film form.  Why?  Basic action, basic characters, and a complex plot that's going to be dragged out for not one, not two, not three, but four films!!!  You could make one film, or just read some short story, that gives the same entertainment that these films do.  Oh well though, I am only a reviewer and regrettably cannot actually tell directors what to make and what not to make.  (It's probably better this way)</p></body></html>

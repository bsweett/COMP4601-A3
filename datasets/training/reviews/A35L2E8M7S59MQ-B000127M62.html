<meta name="summary" content="Fun to watch as a slasher film, but fails as a Nightmare and Friday film"></head><body><p>I really have no idea what the point of this movie was, exactly, but I certainly did not enjoy the premise of the ordeal.  It's kind of fun to watch Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees duke it out, but overall it won't leave you feeling very entertained; or that your time had been well spent.<br /><br />The plot opens with the best scene in the entire film, which is the prologue of Robert Englund as the pre-supernatural Freddy and his origin.  From here, the film quickly declines.  Freddy , trapped in Hell because of the fact that the people of Springwood have erased every trace of his existence (thus children don't know him, and as such can't fear him, so thus Freddy can't enter their dreams....I don't recall Nancy knowing who Freddy was until her mother explained in the first Nightmare film, but OK).  He cons Jason to rise from the dead and kill the (as usual, overly horny teens) kids of Elm Street, thus causing his name to spread once more.<br /><br />This results in Freddy losing it when he realizes Jason's gone on a murderous rage (duh) and is preventing Freddy from savoring the time and elaboration he likes to take when killing teens.  Annnnd, this is where the "plot" of Freddy and Jason actually fighting comes in.  The fight in Freddy's boiler room dreamscape is very nice, and the Crystal Lake fight at the end is also entertaining up until the construction site portion onwards.  Problem is that between these fights, there really is zero substance.<br /><br />A usual problem with slashers is horribly present here: horrible, ditzy, female actresses.  They're good on the eyes, but make the brain cringe.  The blonde girl who's the lead is "a virgin" (PAH! I bet...) and there is a scene in dreamland where Freddy creeps his claws up her leg in what would have been horrifying...if her character was at all believable, or something the audience could relate to.  As far as the audience is concerned, Freddy may as well be threatening to defile a trash can.<br /><br />The problem is mainly that Jason kills the most people yet he is presented as some sort of anti-hero while Freddy is the pure villain.  What is with these crossover monster features and making one of the antagonists winding up as some sort of hero figure?  Plus, Freddy Krueger is a far more interesting character than Jason Vorhees who is a boring zombie who stumbles through everything like Frankenstein on steroids while Freddy has menace in the fact that...he just really likes killing!  Robert Englund (As usual) portrays Freddy Krueger as someone who savors each and every life he takes while Jason is mindlessly hacking his way through each scene.<br /><br />I'm no blood fiend, but the fact that Freddy only kills ONE TEEN in this entire film through dreamland (and it isn't even good by Freddy standards) while Jason not only kills the most "good guys" but is also portrayed as the hero of this clash.  Anyone else see some messed up logic here?  Oh well, Robert Englund, as expected, delivers entertaining quotes and sequences as Freddy, but aside from this the movie has no merit.</p></body></html>

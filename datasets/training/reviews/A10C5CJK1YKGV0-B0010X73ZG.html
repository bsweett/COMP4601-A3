<meta name="summary" content="Wow ... unexpected ..."></head><body><p>To say that I wasn't expecting much from this film is an understatement. During a recent trip to my local movie store, they were getting rid of all their current back stock of DVD's and I was able to purchase this gem for $2.50. My wife is the horror fanatic and also the one who put it in. I was sitting in the kitchen, working on my novel, when I started to crane my neck over the counter to watch what was going on. Andre Braugher is one of my favourite actors of all time and he unfortunately is in too little offerings these days.<br /><br />I complained when it started, saying: "here we go again, another Stephen King adaptation full of no-name / B-list actors in a made for TV drama. Lemme guess, some toxic sludge escapes during a power outage and acts like a growth compound on the surrounding wildlife?"<br /><br />How wrong I was, and how quickly I got sucked in.<br /><br />I'm not going to include any spoilers in this, as this is a film that folks that love the genre, love Stephen King -- must see and continue to watch to the bitter end. While some may bemoan the ending, you have to come to terms with the difference between a bad ending and an incredibly disturbing one. This film has an incredibly disturbing ending and bothered me well into the next day - not a bad ending. I wouldn't want to be cast into that scenario for all the gold in the world. The Mist is an excellent film* (note I said film and not movie) that I would've paid to see in the theatre and would've purchased on DVD for full price. It's too bad that they didn't market this film better as the Studios are doing much more for Sci-Fi / Horror these days than they used to.<br /><br />The special effects are also a bonus and not gratuitous, over the top or unnecessary. Frank Darabont has really made a very well-crafted film and worthy of some kind of mention.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just for the sake of things, I watched this movie a second time. Knowing full well what was coming, and having prepared myself mentally, I have to say that it *does* hold up after multiple viewings and actually took an even darker turns in my mind as I realized what I was about to witness again as the film progressed. I'm very surprised that more people aren't talking about this film. It's some of the better, and unexplored, Stephen King material.</p></body></html>

In his quest to discover his identity, people try to kill him, and he reacts with professional swiftness. He teams up with a young woman, and together they elude the killers while searching for answers and falling in love.<br /><br />This was obviously written with me in mind. I mean, come on--it's got almost every one of my favorite things: a spy story, action/adventure, amnesia, a romance--heck, the romantic interest is even German. What baffles me is that I'd never read Ludlum's book even though it came out at a time when I was reading a lot of spy novels. I've ordered it.<br /><br />At any rate, I can't say yet how the movie compares to the book, but the movie is excellent. Matt Damon plays a man who doesn't realize he's a professional assassin perfectly--the combination of good-intentioned searching for his identity with the growing realization that he's not just some nice guy who works in an office is very convincing.<br /><br />Franka Potente, too, is very realistic as an adventurous young woman who ends up in over her head, but is reluctant to leave because of her growing feelings for him.<br /><br />The action is nonstop and exciting, and the mystery of who he is and why people are trying to kill him is compelling.<br /><br />This is one of those rare movies I can watch over and over again. One of my favorites.</p></body></html>

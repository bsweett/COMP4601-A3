<meta name="summary" content="Mission Impossible Light"></head><body><p>Mission Impossible begins near the end of the movie.  IMF super-agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is seen tied to a chair being tortured by a sinister looking bad guy, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  The bad guy makes a reference to some event on an airplane and tells Hunt that if he doesn't tell him where the Rabbit's Foot is, he is going to shoot his wife (Michelle Monaghan) in front of him.  He counts to ten, but Hunt doesn't give in.  There's a gun shot. Then black.  The movie then rewinds back in time to show how Hunt ended up where he did.  It turns out that Hunt had retired from active duty and was training agents at the academy.  Everyone in his "normal" life, including his fianc&eacute;e, Julia, believes he's a high-level agent in the Department of Transportation.  At his engagement party, Hunt gets a telephone call that causes him to leave to go "get some ice" at a nearby gas station.  A guy at the store talks to Hunt behind his back (literally) and tells him that the IMF needs Hunt for a mission, and ace student of his (Keri Russell) has disappeared.  Hunt declines, but after a night of nightmares tells his fianc&eacute; he has to leave on a special assignment.<br /><br />Thus begins the part of MI:III where things get a little more interesting.  Hunt selects a team which includes Luther Strickell (Ving Rhames) and sets out for Germany.  They find the kidnapped agent and a helicopter chase through a field of modern windmills ensues.  That chase is about the most exciting thing that happens in the movie.  From there the action moves to Washington, D.C. to Vatican City back to Washington, D.C. and finally in Shanghai.  Along the way the agents learn about evil weapons dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a device he has in his possession called the "Rabbit's Foot" which based on speculation by a computer guy at IMF headquarters might have the potential to destroy the entire world.<br /><br />MI: III is not that great of a movie.  J.J. Abrams is one of the hottest properties in Hollywood right now.  He got a huge surge of power capital to spend after creating ALIAS and after the huge success of LOST.  He's also the screenwriter for a few moderately successful films, e.g. ARMAGEDDON.  MI:III is his first known foray into major motion picture directing and from the looks of it, Abrams should stick to television.  In fact, the entire film can be summed up this way:  MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: III is like an extended version of ALIAS, but with the two main characters from the Mission Impossible movies.  That's it.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman is the best thing about the movie and he's on screen for a total of about 8 ? minutes.  Ving Rhames is the 2nd best thing about the movie, but his character has to play second fiddle to Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt.  As for the Rabbit's Foot, we never actually learn exactly what it is or why it's so valuable.  Billy Crudup gives a nice performance as one of Hunt's commanders, John Musgrave.  It adds a little more sparkle to the movie, but after seeing Crudup in BATMAN BEGINS it seems like Hollywood has already decided to typecast the guy.<br /><br />The only thing valuable in the film besides those three performances are the cameos.  Look, it's Keri Russell, Laurence Fishburne, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q, etc.  The action scenes aren't much to look at and there really aren't very many twists to this film (there are a grand total of two masks in this film).  The pendulum in Shanghai is kind of lame and the shoot out on the bridge has been seen almost in entirety in promos.<br /><br />Overall, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: III is the weakest of the three movies in the series.  It is full of unanswered questions and doesn't give the real stars of the movie (Rhames and Hoffman) much screen time.  The action is toned down and is somewhat lackluster (except for the helicopter chase).  As a movie, it's only average.  However, if you've seen everything on tv, you might enjoy watching this big-screen, extended episode that's a cousin to ALIAS.</p></body></html>

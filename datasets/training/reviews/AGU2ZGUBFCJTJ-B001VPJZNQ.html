<meta name="summary" content="The Moose Hole - "Give Us the Rundown!""></head><body><p>Do you smeeeeeelll what the Rock is cooking? Well The Rock has been cooking up a whole load of goodies ever since his less then stellar debut on the WWF circuit. Not only has his popularity in the wrestling ring improved greatly from the days of "Rocky Sucks!" but he has been able to do what few fellow wrestlers can: Break away with a successful acting career. After a largely hyped appearance in The Mummy Returns, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson starred in the Mummy spin-off film, The Scorpion King, which was able to gross $84 million in the summer of 2002 and have him labeled as the next action star. Universal Pictures, seeing the great investing potential of this former wrestling icon, quickly signed him up with his next project teaming The Rock up with Seann William Scott, who has already had success this year with American Wedding. Dwayne Johnson has been able to work well in the action area but can he bring comedy into the mix? The studio definitely hopes so after investing $75 million in The Rundown (aka "Helldorado" aka "Welcome to the Jungle") and releasing it in a time period that is not known to have too many top earners.<p>The story centers on a hit-man who's out for one last job but this small assignment is more then he bargained for. Beck, an efficient man for hire, is not the normal kind of person in his line of profession. He gives people options, he would prefer cooking to fighting, and hates to use guns. After a brawl in a bar one night, Beck decides he wants out but his boss isn't going to let him off so easy. He sends him out on one more job: Travel to the Amazon, picking up his no-good son, and bring him back to the house. If he completes the job, he gets out of the hit-man profession and can open his own restaurant, the one thing he seems most passionate about. Beck believes this will just be another typical job but things change quickly. Not only does he have to deal with horny monkeys and quarrelsome natives, Beck knocks horns with Hatcher, the ruthless tyrant of Helldorado. Both men are after the same thing and both will do anything to get him but the question lies on who wants him more? The story for The Rundown is, quite surprisingly, fabulous. This is quite possibly one of the most original action/comedy films of the year with a wonderful blend of well choreographed fight scenes, hilarious comedy, and a balanced story to back it all up.<p>Though the cast is small, most members perform beyond expectations while others achieve the normal acting level. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson flattens Stalone, Willis, and even Schwarzenegger becoming the next cultural action star. Every fight sequence is packed wall to wall with high testosterone action and The Rock proving he can kick some serious ass in a grand style. And who knew he could be so funny? Well, a good amount of people who saw him perform on Saturday Night Live last year, but outside of that group, not many. For those not lucky enough to catch that one of the few truly funny SNL episodes in recent years (And, yes, the show has been pretty bad for a couple of years now), he proves all the skeptics wrong in this film. Seann William Scott, who performed earlier this year in Bulletproof Monk and American Wedding (the latter being the much bigger success), sure proves he has the comedic idiot act down pat though not as hilarious as he was in the last American Pie film. Perhaps it was the absence of using the F-bomb so many times but maybe it was the fact that the movie-going public isn't use to seeing him as the idiotic yet nice guy in comedies. Christopher Walken, as usual, never fails to amaze us. Once again he is able to mix comedy and drama well together without balancing one or the other. There were several jokes made by the talented actor that took awhile to get the point of but when the punch-line came, the jokes really paid off. And Rosario Dawson, a not too well known performer, was moderate at best but the main problem was that, as semi-important as her character was, wasn't featured as much as she should have been. There weren't too many that showed off her acting chops, which is quite a shame since there could have been plenty of potential had they allowed her to showcase her talent.<p>Overall, The Rundown smashes, blasts, and bombards the movie theater with everything its got and, quite surprisingly, the audience is left wanting more, which, for once, isn't a bad thing. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson proves he can live up to all the hype declaring him as this generation's action star and shows off some true acting chops that few from his former line of work can do. As good as the film was, it wasn't quite as funny as other comedies like American Wedding were. The problem lied in the fact that The Rundown took awhile to really get going by setting up a decent back story and stuff like that, which can be good on its own but when you're dealing with a buddy comedy such as this, it can come off as being a bit of a disappointment. The time length of the feature seemed a little too short but this is quite a minor squabble compared to all the praise one can say about this film. The Rundown is another valiant effort from The Rock and Universal Pictures that proves action flicks can be funny, intense and dramatic all in the same feature without outbalancing itself.</p></body></html>

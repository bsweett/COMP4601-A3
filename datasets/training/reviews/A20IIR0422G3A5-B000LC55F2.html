The most notable thing about the film is the cast, including an impressive list of both young talents, such as Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Scarlett Johansson, plus venerable older and more experienced names such as Michael Caine and the brilliantly elusive David Bowie. The director, as the filmmaker for the acclaimed `Batman Begins', Christopher Nolan, is also a talent not to be taken lightly. And yet, through all the dark twists and turns, the movie never seems to elicit any strong sympathies for the characters and the Byzantine byways of flashbacks and surprises.<br /><br />The keystone which holds the plot together is the use of the historical character of scientist and engineer, Nicoli Telsa, the inventor of alternating current and competitor with Thomas Edison, the proponent of direct current (Telsa's doctrines ultimately won; however, Edison gets most of the fame and fortune for introducing electrification to the world). Telsa, played with delightful mystery by Bowie, is contracted by one of the two principle character magicians, Robert Angier (played by Jackman), to build him an apparatus for a fabulous new trick. While the trick has lots of special on-stage effects from man-made static electrical charges, it may be seen as nothing more than the usual tired disappearing man trick. The two features which make it more entrancing are the fact that the disappearance is done without the aid of boxes or curtains, and the magician reappears almost instantly from the back of the audience. This trick, and its macabre little twist serve as the climax; however the main body of the story is driven by a highly improbable occurrence when one of the two magician team, Alfred Borden (played by Bale) makes a mistake in the setup for a trick, leading to the accidental death of Angier's wife when a trick goes bad and the woman cannot escape from submersion in a tank of water. The improbabilities are twofold. One, it is highly unlikely that an experienced magician would make that kind of mistake, then forget whether he made it or not. Second, it is improbable that the margin of error between the time the mistake is detected and emergency escape measures are taken would be so small, leading to the death of the magician's subject. And, this improbable event drives the entire plot of the story.<br /><br />These improbabilities are muted just a bit by the jigsaw nature of the movie's timeline. We seem to be jumping around so much between `present' and flashbacks that it's hard to be sure when and where we are at any given point in time. One thriller / surprise ending movie which comes to mind in evaluating this story is the original `The Manchurian Candidate', based on an improbable premise, but so well written, directed, and acted that we form great bonds of sympathy for the main characters, strengthened, at least at the time the movie was released, by a political climate which made the film far less improbable seeming than it actually was. And, the ending was in fact a great, unexpected surprise.<br /><br />The surprise ending of `The Prestige' is signaled by several different clues, some revealed relatively early in the film; however, to be honest, I didn't really put everything together until the end. The strength of the surprise ending is from both the revelation of `the facts of the case' plus the remarkably devious plan to which the physical circumstances are put to resolve the conflict set in motion by the death of the magician's wife.<br /><br />In the end, the premise driving the plot is not sufficiently believable, and we never really connect emotionally with the characters. Even Jackman's Wolverine character in the X-Men movies seems to elicit more sympathy than his far more realistic character here.<br /><br />This is better than many `special effects fests' such as `Van Helsing' and `The League of Remarkable Gentlemen', and it's twists and turns will probably deserve a second and third viewing to get everything straight, but this is very good second rate moviemaking, not worthy of exceptional praise.</p></body></html>

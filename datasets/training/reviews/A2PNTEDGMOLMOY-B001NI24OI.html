<meta name="summary" content=""FNL" Required Viewing for Athletes and Fans"></head><body><p>Most sports fans claim to follow sports because it gives them an escape from the hum-drum routines of daily life.  "Friday Night Lights" tears that cliche to shreds as it proves that to too many people - both the athletes and the fans who adore them -- sports are the primary focus of daily life.<br /><br />Simultaneously obeying and transcending the traditions of the football movie, Peter Berg's "Friday Night Lights" follows the Permian High School football team through its 1988 season. ("FNL" is a slightly fictionalized version of the best-selling non-fiction book by Buzz Bissinger -- and the deviations are relatively minor.)  Odessa, a busted oil town in the sun-blasted plains of west Texas, has nothing going for it except high school football.  Thanks to the complete absence of opportunity in Odessa, the town is full of dreamers -- the kids who dream of a better life outside of Odessa, and the adults who dream of the kids' winning a state championship.<br /><br />Indeed, the town is singularly focused on winning the 5-A Texas state title.  The high school football coach (played with excellent reserve by Billy Bob Thornton, the only "star" in the movie) is the highest-paid employee in the school district.  The football stadium is, by far, the most expensive building in town, holding 20,000 people (every business in town closes during games).  And the players are gods, with high school girls literally falling at their feet.<br /><br />Several sub-plots involving specific players captivate the audience during the march to the state title (which commences with brutal two-a-day practices in the 110-degree August sunshine).  Two of the most riveting sub-plots involve Boobie Miles and Don Billingsley.  Boobie, the star running back with dreams of the NFL, may be the best player in the state and the history of the high school, but thanks to a cruel twist of fate has to come to terms with the fact that his destiny is more likely entwined with riding the back of a garbage truck than playing on TV on Sundays.  Don Billingsley has to confront his own athletic limitations -- he's never going to get a Division I scholarship -- as well as his drunken, violent father (played surprisingly well by country singer Tim McGraw).  There are other excellent stories told by this movie, as well.<br /><br />The football action scenes are shot very well -- these are real collisions rather than CGI special effects -- and at all times we believe we're watching the actors play football rather than stuntmen, even for the most brutal tackles and blocks.<br /><br />"FNL" does not limit itself to the perils of sports.  Look for some surprising moments of redemption as the squad moves closer and closer to its Holy Grail, the state championship -- I lost count of how many times the players and coaches were exhorted to "win state" by the townsfolk . . . and sometimes with more threat than encouragement.<br /><br />By casting a bunch of virtual no-name actors, "FNL" creates a sense of realism that makes the stories that much more powerful.  The young actors' lack of a pedigree does not diminish the truth contained in their performances -- like "City of God," "Friday Night Lights" proves that young, talented actors can be plucked out of thin air and work magic on the screen.<br /><br />The best sports movies, including "Hoosiers," "Bull Durham," and "The Bad News Bears," contain wisdom that cannot be found in other tales because sports, like it or not, dominate the American lifestyle.  "FNL" reminds us of the extent of this domination, both the bitter and the sweet, and that our devotion to sports comes at a price while paying some dividends as well.  A must-see for the high school athlete and the parents of the high school athlete.</p></body></html>

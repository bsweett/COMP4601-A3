They decide to splice genes with human DNA and end up with an almost human like creature which has amphibian and bird flight capabilities. Against their better judgment, they decide to keep the baby and study its lifespan. Obviously all good intentions are fraught with dangers and the movie shows us the dangers of humans trying to play good.<br />If you have very low expectations, which I did, you will be pleasantly surprised. The creature turns against the humans but has a personality and the movie tries to delve in to its psyche. This Frankenstein type of saga is watchable. Three stars. 11/15/10</p></body></html>

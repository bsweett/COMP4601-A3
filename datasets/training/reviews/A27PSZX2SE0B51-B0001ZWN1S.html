<meta name="summary" content="One More Orange For The Pile: My Take On "The Godfather""></head><body><p>Generally regarded as one of the finest movies ever made, "The Godfather" would seem to be review-proof.  By this point, some 30 years after its initial release, what else could be said of it?  Critically it's adored.  And those who loathe it are bound to loathe it no matter what I, or anyone else really, has to say.<p>So instead of doing a standard review, I thought I'd pick out key elements from the movie, elements that struck me as important after my fourth and most recent viewing, but that I haven't seen analyzed to death over the years.  This effort will, I hope, shed some new light on the film, going beyond the usual iconic moments (the horse in the bed; the cat on the lap; Sonny at the tollbooth) and memorable dialogue ("I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"; "Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes"; "Leave the gun... take the cannoli") to give you something personally relevant.  And if doesn't, then at least it gave me the opportunity to write about "The Godfather" for awhile.<p>"I believe in America."  These are the film's opening lines.  Spoken not by Marlon Brandon, Al Pacino, James Caan or even, say, Abe Vigoda, but by Salvatore Corsitto as Bonasera the Undertaker.  It begins a long speech about how his daughter was beaten to near death, and as Corsitto tells the tale, the camera slowly zooms out to reveal the darkened office, and then the silhouetted visage of Brando.  It begins a curious game of cat and mouse, for it takes a long time for the film to truly reveal whom this story is about.  Now, unless you've been living under a rock for the last thirty years, or, more appropriately, been locked in the trunk of a Cadillac, you know whose story is about to be told.  But let's wipe away hindsight, and assume you are an audience member in a darkened theatre in 1972, one who hasn't read Mario Puzo's soon-to-be-blockbuster book, who'd forgotten the power of Marlon Brando (it had been almost 20 years since "On the Waterfront"), and had never heard of Al Pacino.<p>The first scene makes it clear that Vito Corleone is a powerful presence.  Is this his story?  It would seem so, as his family is gathered together for the luxurious wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire).  But then Vito's consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is introduced, a lawyer who was once taken in by Vito while just an orphan child.  Maybe it is the story of these two men, the Sicilian-born Don and his German-Irish adopted son.  This idea is nearly cemented when Tom goes to Hollywood, ostensibly to get Johnny Fontaine (Al Martino) out of a binding contract with Jack Woltz (John Marley), but more likely just as an excuse to put a horse's head in a bed.  Back in New York, we are introduced to Sonny (Caan), Vito's eldest boy, a hotheaded gorilla more proficient at quenching his animal lusts than at running a crime family.  Is it Sonny's story?  Could be, could be.  See what I mean?  It's like a great game of chess: director Francis Ford Coppola deploys his pawns, his rooks, his knights, and his bishops, before ever moving his Queen.  But when she finally emerges from her sanctuary, the board is wiped clean with a few bold moves.<p>Michael (Pacino), in these early expository scenes, only acts as a Greek chorus.  A war hero and a college boy, he explains to his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) who his father is, and why he should be feared.  And he tries to tell her that that is not him.  But then comes the scene at the hospital.  Vito has been shot, but not killed, and Michael goes to visit him.  Surprised to find no security by his father's room, and aware that this means men are on their way to finish the job, Michael, along with a nurse, decides to move his father to another room.  After a near-farcical scene of hide-and-seek in the hospital halls, Michael, in an attempt to reassure his frightened father, whispers the following lines into the old man's ear: "I'm with you now.  I'm with you."  The double meaning of these words is made quite apparent by Vito's smile and Michael's angst-filled expression.  Just when he thought he was out of the family business, circumstances pull him back in.  Michael's inevitable coronation, and the film's operatic aftermath, is now inevitable.<p>About 110 minutes into the movie, Sonny finds out that Connie's husband Carlo (Gianni Russo) has been slapping her around.  Ever the vigilant brother, Sonny storms out to teach Carlo a lesson.  He finds him on the steps of a brownstone selling drugs, and before Carlo knows what's happening, Sonny is wailing on him mercilessly with punch after punch of staggering power.  Er, all except the fourth one, that is.  Maybe the filmmakers only had time for one take, or maybe a sloppy editor missed it, but the fourth punch misses Carlo by a good 2 feet.  Now, I'm a big believer in the adage, "The exception proves the rule."  And this moment is the film's one blemish, standing out like the Glad garbage man at a Goth convention.  But sandwiched between the film's first and second half, it manages to prove the perfection achieved by each.<p>I first saw "The Godfather" after reading the book as a teenager.  Not the best way to view any film, and nearly fatal here.  I expected to find a lot of the book's rich backstory but didn't.  My first viewing was a disappointment.  Every subsequent viewing, however, has made me fall more in love with this film than I ever thought possible.  And now you know why I chose this alternate method of reviewing: I knew that the hyperbole would flow fast and furious once I begin typing.  Despite my best intentions, I couldn't avoid it.  That is, ultimately, the power of "The Godfather".</p></body></html>

(Well, so far, we've got Hostel, at least.) As Leigh Whanell stuck around to write the script for Saw II, once again co-writing it with the film's director, there seemed a reasonable amount of promise that the sequel would, if not measure up to the original, at least hold its own and be better than the average sequel. And, well, guilty on all counts.<br /><br />This could have actually been entitled Cube, Leigh Whannell-style. It's certainly head and shoulders above either of Cube's painfully anemic sequels. But while Cube is the movie's obvious spiritual daddy, there are certainly a lot more references to old (and more recent) horror films here to choose from; given Whannell's love of intricacy, it's pretty obvious these are conscious, which makes it loads of fun to play spot-the-influence. (The opening scene is a direct homage to one of my favorite recent indie horror films; I knew from the first five minutes that no matter how bad this movie turned out to be, I'd have a soft spot in my heart for it, if only for that.) Technically, it's just as good as the original, which surprised me; the film's major failing lies in... well, I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />Eric Matthews (The Sixth Sense's Donnie Wahlberg), a former beat cop gone to seed while driving a desk, is called out to the site of the latest Jigsaw killing-- one of his informants. Jigsaw has painted a message on the room's wall that names Matthews, but despite this, he's too occupied not only with his other cases, but his son, Daniel (Erik Knudsen, recently of The Prizewinner of Defiance, Ohio), who's turning into a juvenile delinquent. Matthews, however, notices the one thing at the crime scene that will blow the case open; it does, but as Matthews finds out, Jigsaw does have a habit of making sure everything, down to the final detail, is planned-- Matthews and his team are forced to solve Jigsaw's next puzzle, which involves eight people stuck in a trapped house-- one of whom is Daniel.<br /><br />The mystery angle of the film, like that of its predecessor, is immaculately done. Everything falls into place (with one odd exception that makes me wonder if there's a deleted scene that contains it) perfectly, and it's a pleasure to watch, even if it wears thin in places; there was at least one aspect of the big picture I figured out at least ten minutes before I should have. The film's main characters are relatively well drawn, though, with the larger cast of this film, that translates to the minor characters getting rather short shrift, especially Laura (Seventh Heaven's Beverley Mitchell, though it's possible there's another deleted scene or two floating about that fills in some unanswered questions we end up with about her). That said, everyone acts the parts they get, and acts them well. Not the actors' fault if the parts are sometimes threadbare. They do the best with what they get, and Whannell and Bousman have come up with a solid cast of underrated Hollywood young-and-beautifuls here; Wahlberg shows that his star turn in The Sixth Sense, as small as it was, was not a fluke, Glenn Plummer (Strange Days) does a fascinating Mos Def impersonation, and Dina Meyer, well, proves that she can, in fact, act her way out of a paper bag.<br /><br />Where Whannell goes horribly, horribly wrong is in letting one of the homages cross the line from homage to "just downright stupid." This is something it would be possible to laugh off, of course, except that it concerns the entire climax of the film. Can't say any more than that, but let's just say the set for the final scenes should never have resurfaced.<br /><br />Once again, I find myself reviewing a Hollywood horror film-- for the third time in a month-- that had the potential to be a fantastic piece of work, and blew it in the final minutes. Unlike the others, though, Saw II stays good for a much longer portion of its length than do the others. Not great, but good. *** ?</p></body></html>

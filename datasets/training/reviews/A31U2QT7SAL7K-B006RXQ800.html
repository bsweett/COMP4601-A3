The film's scope is so great that Scorcese's literally and figuratively utilized the proverbial "cast of thousands". Mammoth sets and period costuming accentuate the story of a young man seeking revenge against the man that slew his father many years earlier. A secondary element of the plot is its tale of a country in transition. The emergence of the "gangs" in New York is a reflection of the various ethnic groups that made up much of the immigrant populations and the clashes of such strong Old World cultures. The corrupt city officials that ran New York at the time are also part of this riveting story. <p>Daniel Day Lewis's "Bill the Butcher" is the kind of reprehensible character that audiences love to hate. Lewis embodies the character's warped sense of patriotism with a swagger of bravado that is magnified on the big screen. When given the right role, DiCaprio shows his mettle as an actor. "Gangs" gives him that in the part of "Amsterdam Vallon", a young man seeking vengeance as well as respect for his people. Cameron Diaz's "Jenny Everdeane" is miles away from anything that the actress has done before or since. Henry Thomas is also impressive as DiCaprio's friend and betrayer. <p>One of the great mysteries is why this film did not sweep the 2003 Academy Awards. It should have for all parties concerned. <p>But, the world, especially the Oscar-voting contingency, is not a fair place.</p></body></html>

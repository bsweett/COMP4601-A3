This film as well as the press coverage surrounding its pre-theatrical release did bring attention to this monstrous situation in Africa. I confess, I didn't know anything about conflict diamonds prior to this.  I'm not a jewlry person.  I don't own a single diamond-or cubic zirconia.  Back to the movie.  Despite a compelling situation a couple of good acting performances, (Djimon Hounsou particularly.), great cinmetography and even score, the movie fails at making a grand slam with me.  There are way too many coinsidences and all three of our main characters are apparently shielded by a jedi's force given how they are able to dodge a billion bullets. Dicaprio's accent is strong in the begining and dies down considerably before we hit the mid marker.  It's never completely gone (circa Kevin Costner's Robin Hood) but it is noticable.  The romance (if you want to call it that) was sort of forced and seem to come out of nowhere.  Before you hit the final act, you can pretty much guess the Hollywood ending you're heading toward.  BUT it's still a good film and worth seeing.</p></body></html>

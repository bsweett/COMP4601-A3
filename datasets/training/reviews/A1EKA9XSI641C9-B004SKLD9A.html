The atmosphere's are really like how I usually picture a Dystopian world.  Very grey and nuetral colors.  Christian Bale is really cool, but I like him better in Reign of Fire.  Our boy from Goldeneye Sean Bean plays a small part as Bale's partner at the beginning who discovers emotion before the movie sets in.  That one guy who's on a UPN show...ah..I don't know his name, plays Bale's new partner, sort of evil.  Well now let me talk about something confusing.  Christian Bale plays a "Cleric" who is a very highly skilled fighter used as an instrument by "Father" to take out people who break the laws of feeling emotion and taking their medicin which helps them be emotionless.  See, after WWIII the world decides that something has to be done, so they take away all free expresion and emotion.  Fahrenheit 451..yes.  There's even a scene where two guys in white clean suits burn the Mona Lisa with flamethrowers.  Anyway it's about Christian Bale discovering what it's like to feel, and he breaks down, but is good at supressing his emotion when he's around other people.  But is this really about humanity's inevitable dive into a dystopian society?  Or is it about cool action fight scenes?  Here's where something is strange.  For the first scenes the dystopian mood is set in showing us what a terrible place it is.  Than there's really outrageous scenes where Christian Bale turns into Neo and begins shooting everyone in sight without getting a scratch.  It's sort of hard to tell what the writer was all about, but maybe some of that is explained by the DVD features.  Regardless of what it's really about you should see it, because it's still a good movie.</p></body></html>

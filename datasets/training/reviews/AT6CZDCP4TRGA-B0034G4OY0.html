<meta name="summary" content="Better than most Hollywood flicks, but only so-so for..."></head><body><p>...a Clint Eastwood movie.  This film is visually beautiful, with a more or less engrossing storyline and characters that I did come to care about...but overall is a very superficial glossing-over of an otherwise fascinating subject.  The opening scene with the tsunami is quite impressive; unfortunately, the rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to it.  The ending is predictably Hollywood as far as much-too-neatly tying up all the loose ends with a happy and fortuitous twist, but again fails to present or support any coherent theme or thrust behind the story.  There is simply no subtext at all---it's very much a straightforward, what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of light drama, kind of a Public Service Announcement to raise awareness that hey, people who almost die usually report the same visions and there just might be a couple of genuine psychics out there amid all the fakes...not exactly breathtaking new information.<br /><br />Cecile De France is a gorgeous woman and feast for the eyes, but aside from that this is far from Eastwood's best work.  All the same, I do not regret renting it from Blockbuster.  I definitely would have regretted purchasing it, however!<br /><br />3 and 1/2 stars.</p></body></html>

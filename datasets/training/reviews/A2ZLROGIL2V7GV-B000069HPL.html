<meta name="summary" content="I'm Still Laughing just THINKING about the Movie!"></head><body><p>This is one of my favorite comedies.  Why?  Because it's not one of those movies that only relies on tired and crude offensive sex jokes and gross out humor.  (And yes, those are fine as well.  You'll notice that I didn't really have a problem with "Freddy got Fingered."  It just gets overplayed too much.)  The movie is actually ingenious with a great story, plot, and a terrific cast of characters.<p>Peter Gibbons is living through Hell twenty-four-seven.  He works for a corporation that has eight bosses barking orders at him everyday.  It seems like it just gets worse everyday.  Well, that all changes when his eyes are open and his mind is at ease.  He realizes that the answer to his solution is to not care anymore.  And that's exactly what he does.<p>I loved everything about this movie.  All of the characters are unique in each way.  But I must say, Milton steals the show.  The mumbling man is played by the very hillarious Stephen Root.  He really is the show-stopper.  Keep a close eye on him.<p>This movie is so realistic, it hurts.  Especially if you work at that kind of an environment.  Come on, how many times have you been stuck in traffic and it seems like everyone is moving except for the people in your lane?  This movie takes all of the elements that take place at a work place and magnifies it a hundred times over.  It's so funny....it's painful to watch at times.<p>The DVD could've been better.  No eye-popping special features.  It's a shame, since this is such a great movie, and is loved by a lot of people.  Still, it's the CONTENT that counts.  The picture and sound quality was really good.<p>"Office Space" is a hillarious laugh-riot that will hook you from the start.  Check it out as soon as you can.  In a world filled with terrible comedies, it's refreshing to know that good ones still exist and are still being made.  See this movie!  Chances are you will love it.</p></body></html>

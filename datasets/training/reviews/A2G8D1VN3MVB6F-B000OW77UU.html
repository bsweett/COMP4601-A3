<meta name="summary" content="Great Story About One Man's Triumph Over Adversity"></head><body><p>This is a great movie, it really is. The story involves a man who overcomes great odds to further his family's position within a major city. His family is falling apart because he has no steady income, his wife leaves because she can't deal, and he has to take care of his son. In spite of all these troubles, the main character, chris, is able to get a prestigious internship with a brokerage firm.  Things work out, and after many troubles, he is able to succeed. Will does a great job with this character, so the entire movie is worth the time watching it. So, get this movie and have fun.</p></body></html>

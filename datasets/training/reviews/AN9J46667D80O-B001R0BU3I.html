<meta name="summary" content="Beyond Good and Evil"></head><body><p>"The truth is complicated," says the tagline to this latest Don Cheadle film. Too right it's complicated, especially in a movie like this, where the line between good and evil, right or wrong, is not so much a line as it is more of just...<br /><br />Cheadle plays Samir, a man who was born in Sudan. In 1978 his father, a devout Muslim, was blown up in a car-bomb attack. Shortly thereafter Samir moves to the USA and is raised by his American mother. He then goes for a career in the Army and then... well, then he apparently falls in with some unsavory characters.<br /><br />The movie chronicles his time working undercover with a terrorist group. Well, possibly undercover. Jeff Daniels plays his controller and makes several comments that might lead one to wonder what Daniels' character's real agenda is.<br /><br />In the film we see the inner-workings of a terrorist cell. We watch as they stage actions in Spain and France and gear up for action here in the USA, coming to the country by way of Canada and Mexico. If nothing else this serves well to highlight the international nature of the problem.<br /><br />Samir is showing as being very much a man in conflict. Clearly he abhors terrorism and loves Islam. He's asked to do things by his controller that he believes are evil, but he's also asked by the terrorists to do things that are even more evil, bringing to mind the question, "How much evil is allowed do be done in the name of good?"<br /><br />The performances all around are excellent. The script is tightly-written and well-paced. The action scenes are good and the locations are magnificent. Not a perfect movie, but certainly a good one and worth seeing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still Disturbing 30 years later"></head><body><p>I have seen "The Exorcist" several tims, and picked up "the version you've never seen" when it hit the shelves last year. It's amazing how this landmark movie still holds it's power 30 years after it's initial release. I will not bother to try and do this film justice with an amateur review, and unless you have been hiding under a rock for the last 3 decades you most likely know what the story is about. But I would like to touch on two things, the added scenes in the latest version are great. As if you needed any more reason the feel sympathy for Regan, watching her go through the medical tests is just awful. Linda Blair just does such a great job in this movie, it's really a shame her career took such a nose-dive. The other aspect of the film that I really enjoyed with this new DVD package was the soundtrack. It was like watching a "new" movie with enhanced audio, and with surround sound "Tubular Bells" has never sounded better. This film may not be for everyone (my wife still refuses to watch it), but if you have the nerves to handle it...well the newest version is well worth the money.</p></body></html>

With the eye-popping TRON: Legacy recently unleashed on cinemas, its follow up is the equally impressive, though decidedly more traditional Disney fare of Tangled, a clever reworking of the Rapunzel fairy story.<br /><br />Both are supposed to be amongst the most expensive movies ever made. That's a pretty big punt for one studio in the austere times of 2010.<br /><br />But then, when you celebrate, you should do it in style. As the opening titles roll, Disney announces that Tangled is its 50th feature length animation, and in that spirit I suppose it has tried to throw in something for everyone, and impressively, has succeeded. There's the princess in the tower, musical numbers, a Robin Hood- like rascally hero, and a wide cast of hilarious bit parts including a gang of villainous but kind-hearted ruffians and what has to be the most scene-stealing horse in motion picture history.<br /><br />Tangled certainly passed the real acid test: I went armed with two sceptical boys (who professed they'd rather watch TRON: Legacy) and a highly enthusiastic five year old girl, who wanted nothing more than to see a beautiful princess, and all of them came out fizzing.<br /><br />It's interesting where this places Disney. In the same month that Disney demonstrates with TRON its technical credentials and, perhaps, how far In George Lucas' direction it is prepared to stray from its original mandate, it also shows a marked return to its most classic era - something that has been a deliberate strategy for the company over the last couple of years. For Tangled is fundamentally, an innocent, fun tale. It harks back to Disney's heyday: It is populated by a tried and true Disney archetypes: a classic evil witch of the Cruella de Ville mould, a feisty but fundamentally pre-feminist 18 year-old heroine in Rapunzel herself (in this way contrasting quite markedly with Shrek's Fiona), sidekicks in the form of unlikely but adorable animals, and a cuddly rogues gallery intended only to provide comic relief.<br /><br />And true to this description Tangled is an altogether less knowing, less arch adventure than any of the Pixar outings to date, where you fancy they've targeted the parents and thrown in the odd jokes to keep the kids engaged. Here, this is a kids' movie pure and simple, and is none the worse for it either: as long as you check your cynical fin-du-si&egrave;cle attitude at the door, you'll have a ball.<br /><br />Regular readers will know I'm no great fan of 3D for the sake of it, but here I must say the 3D, and the animation generally, is continually impressive. I find myself rather fatigued by technological advances for the sake of it (well - it's shooting fish in a barrel: after all, there's not much you can't do with enough computer horsepower), but what impresses is the artfulness in which the technology is employed. The sweeping camera angles, clever use of perspective; the beautiful framing of every scene - the musical numbers particularly are brilliantly staged (for me to enjoy them, they'd have to be: I can't stand musicals). A bunch of Pentium processors won't give you that - but it's something Disney has always had a long suit in, and Tangled certainly measures up well against the studio's esteemed standards.<br /><br />In terms of characters, the cast are (to my limited outlook) relative unknowns and perform a workmanlike fashion, and are never allowed get in the way of the animated wizardry (which is how it ought to be in a Disney film). Mandy Moore does a fine job as Rapunzel; Zachary Levy had a little more trouble with Flynn Rider (or perhaps the character was just less appealing) and Donna Murphy seems to have come direct from Central Casting to play the role of Gothel but in any case all, and every other presence on the screen, was blown out of the water by Maximus, a centurion's horse, who was separated from his rider in a chase scene and made the most of his fifteen minutes of fame (they lasted an hour and a half, at any rate!). Somewhat galling, I dare say, for the voice actors to be outdone by an unvoiced animation, and he wasn't even the only one - there's a delightful running gag about a Marcel Marceau mime also!<br /><br />Look, it's not Citizen Kane, but if you're nostalgic for the sorts of films Disney used to make, and you're jaded by the world-weary attitude that seems to infect every "kids" movie in the digitally animated era, this one will be a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></body></html>

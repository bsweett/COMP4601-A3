<meta name="summary" content="PRETTY GOOD FILM."></head><body><p>[RATING BETWEEN 4,5 STARS]. I mainly bought this film because of the girl[dakota fanning] who is in it. I would say this is again one of those films where you have got to like the actors in it or it's pointless buying it. Quite weird in some parts but great performances done by both Denzel washington and Dakota fanning. As i said i wasen't really sure what this was about, i just desperately wanted it before i read about it. I wouldn't of thought it was that good if dakota didn't act a lot in it. ACTION and FRIENDSHIP all in one. GREAT FILM.</p></body></html>

I love 'em, so remember that as you read this review...<p>  The movie is worth seeing just for the cameos in the first scene. I won't spoil the surprise, and I hope no one else does. Really inspired casting choices....The rest of the film delivers the usual Austin formula- A ridiculous plot that is just a framework to hang the jokes on. This time, Austin needs to rescue his father, played by Michael Caine, from the clutches of Dr. Evil and the underutilized Goldmember (Both played by Mike Myers, who also plays Powers and Fat Bastard), a skin-flake eating euro-swinger who enjoys painting peoples "Wedding-Tackle" gold. (Considering all of the legal hoopla that went on regarding the use of the name Goldmember, he really has very little screen time, and contributes nothing to the film, aside from the strange plot to use a tractor beam ("Preparation H") to pull a meteor into the Earth, thereby flooding it, while the bad guys are safely in their Dr. Evil-shaped Submarine.<p>  The film suffers from the same problems most other film series do- Too many characters competing for screen time. We've got the returning Austin, Basil Exposition, Fat Bastard, Dr. Evil, Frau, Scott, Mini-Me, Number Two (No Mr. Bigglesworth this time, except for a brief flashback), and then there are the new characters, such as Foxxy Cleopatra and Nigel powers....It's a very crowded movie, and it felt a little too long. Caine and Beyonce Knowles are welcome additions to the cast, though, especially Knowles- She does a great job as Foxxy, and she sure is easy on the eyes. I'd like to see her return in the next Powers flick. <p>  There are some BIG laughs, especially the scene where a bewildered seaman watches Austin and Mini-Me's shadows on a curtain. I laughed so hard I actually cried, and wound up missing some of the scene while I wiped my eyes. If that ain't a good reason to see a comedy, I don't know what is.....</p></body></html>

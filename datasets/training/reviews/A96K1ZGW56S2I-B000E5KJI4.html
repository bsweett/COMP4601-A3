<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie, But Some Heavy Miscasting."></head><body><p>Putting aside all the mythological characters and even many of the historical facts, TROY is an epic film that attempts to display the Trojan War in less than three hours. Seeing that the Trojan War lasted around a decade, it's almost an insane feat. However, for the most part, the movie works. There's a lot of fierce fighting and the political underpinings around the war are examined. This was a film that probably did have a cast of thousands and the 1000 ships sailing from Greece to Troy along with the conflicts that follow are spectacular.<br /><br />However, the movie could have been much better. The basic story about the Trojan War has been altered. That in itself isn't that big of a deal, but most of the things that have been changed weren't changed to make the movie flow smoother or even to make the movie more interesting. Instead, they've were changed to accommodate star Brad Pitt and give him more screen time. Normally, that wouldn't bother me much, but Pitt has been horribly miscast as Achilles. By changing the story to give him more screen time, the filmmakers have made the film less interesting and appealing.<br /><br />Another one of the big stars of the movie is Orlando Bloom. Bloom portrays the love struck Paris--you know, the guy who steals Helen away from her husband in Greece and takes her to Troy. Though Bloom looks and fits into his role better than Pitt, Bloom too, is miscast. Paris might have been somewhat of a whiner and even a bit of a wimp compared to his brother Hector, but he probably wasn't the pretty boy that he's made to be in the film (and if I'm not mistaken, according to the "real" story Paris doesn't survive the invasion of the city either).<br /><br />The real star of this movie and an actor who continues to be overlooked and underrated is Eric Bana. Bana is dead on as Hector, Troy's great warrior and the one man who could have bested Achilles had he not been so invinsible.  Bana's portrayal is perfect and would have been even had the movie been better casted.<br /><br />Overall TROY is a somewhat enjoyable film that attempts to recapture the spirit of the grand epic movie rather than tell a historically accurate description of the Trojan War. There's a little romance, some decent sword and sandal combat scenes, and a lot of pretty faces. In short, your basic Hollywood movie.</p></body></html>

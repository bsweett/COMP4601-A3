<meta name="summary" content="Blast You, Rob Zombie!"></head><body><p>Rob, you've had me frustrated with this film from the very beginning. The fact it was being made, that you were doing it, and then the horrendous reviews that were coming in from critics and "online" people. I went into the movie expecting the worst after reading these so called "reviews", and I came out very happy. No movie in recent memory has had me frustrated, nor have I been so led astray from online communities I usually believe. Rob Zombie's interpretation of the 1978 John Carpenter original is by no means a masterpiece. It is flawed, it has cliches, it has holes big enough to drive a semi thru, and parts that expect you to defy all logic. That being said, it was an interesting ride. You all know the story, so no need to get into that. The second the movie starts, it's a bit jarring. It is definitley a Rob Zombie movie, but definitley not a Halloween movie. Things get better once little Michael starts to snap. I was not a fan of the redneck, hillbilly, white trash section of this film, but it gets good when Michael finally flips. Plus, Sheri Moon Zombie is surprisingy emotional and touching in places. William Forsythe?. Well, he's William Forsythe. The second section, at Smith's Grove, is quite interesting. Michael's break out is a little too easy, but riveting nonetheless. The third section, where things really take us to "Halloween" land, is not a "shot by shot remake" that others would lead you to believe. There are some dialogue lifted from the original, and some classic scenes are recreated. However, most of these recreated scenes have a different touch to them, and this half also has new scenes, outcomes, directions, and so on, that cancel out ALL claims that it is a shot by shot remake. Zombie always keeps things interesting and interesting looking, if not some of the characters. He has littered the movie from start to finish with numerous decorations, pumpkins, and trick or treaters, to make this movie feel more like Halloween than even the original, and a number of the sequels. The three teenage girls are a problem. The Laurie character is no Jamie Lee, but she doesn't quite get as short changed as the other two, especially the Linda character. This part of the film felt a bit rushed and poorly thought out. At least Danielle Harris is still beautiful!. Malcolm McDowell is a welcomed Loomis. Once you see him and hear his voice, you realize that there is no other person but him who could of been Loomis. As for Tyler Mane, I was ready to hate his Michael, but I didn't. I still think he's too big, but he was effective and creepy in places. Brad Dourif was a fun choice for Sheriff Brackett, but like other B movie veterans, he is underused and discarded not long after he's introduced. The violence makes Carpenter's original look PG rated. Brutal violence like this has it's place, but I don't care for it in a Halloween movie. That being said, it didn't take me out of the picture as stated by other critics. However, I did feel a scene here and there were quite pointless and were just there to be extreme and hardcore, as if Rob couldn't dream up some scares so he wanted to just jolt people again. The score is teriffic. Bits of Carpetner's original are here and there, as well as Tyler Bates' own. Folks, this isn't the hatchet job a lot of Zombie haters and Halloween purists(of which I am one)are ballyhooing about. It's a very strong and interesting film that had me hooked from start to finish. There is no denying that nothing will ever top or match Carpenter's scary classic, but this was probably the best Halloween since the original, and the first to really give out that classic Halloween vibe, especially in the third act. I never thought I would find myself defending a Rob Zombie movie, since I was not a fan of his other films, but here I am. It's wicked, it's nasty, it's atmospheric, it's creepy, and it's just a wild ride. The first horror movie in a long time to really grab me and make me think about it afterward. Rob, I was all set to write some witty attacks on your film, but I won't get to use them. Instead, I say thanks, thanks for making a Halloween film that really hits you for the first time in nearly 30 years.</p></body></html>

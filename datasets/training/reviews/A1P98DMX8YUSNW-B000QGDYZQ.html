Over and over, we see her go back and forth, until it all begins to make a little sense, or does it? Little of this is realistic, even the scenes where nothing is happening, such as when Bullock climbs in the shower fully clothed with hubby after having a premonition. Instead of laughing at her and calling her crazy, he just stands there looking pensive...Hmmmm.... The whole movie goes on that way.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Loved this film!"></head><body><p>This is definitly one of the best films that I've seen all year! Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet give superb performances as do the rest of the cast. This was a very thought-provoking and sweet film, one that I would definitly recommend watching with the one you love. Charlie Kaufman has written another awesome script that has been flawlessly directed by Micheal Gondry. This is also a chance to see Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood in what may be the most bizarre roles of their career! <p>Some people may be a bit freaked out by how unconventional this film is. Don't worry, everything pretty much comes together in the end, and trying to figure it all out is just part of the fun! (...) <p>All in all, a great film, and Jim and Kate deserve Oscar nods.<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></body></html>

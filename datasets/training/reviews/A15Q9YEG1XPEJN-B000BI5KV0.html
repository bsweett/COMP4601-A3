<meta name="summary" content="Lovingly created and edited film that effectively demonstrates the delicacy of nature"></head><body><p>March of the Penguins may not be chronicalling the lives of an endangered species, but it certainly brings to the forefront the reality of just how delicate life is and how difficult it can be as well.<br /><br />It is hard to watch this film and not feel a tug at your heart as you see the imprinted dedication that these birds have to reproduction and survival of the fittest.<br /><br />In a way, this is a film about mankind too - or at least how we have strayed from what is truly important in life.<br /><br />These birds live in the harshest climate in the world. Some "march" over 70 miles each way to a safe mating ground. Some never return, due to starvation, exhaustion, age, or predators. Others make the journey only to be rebuffed by potential mates or, in a sorrowful scene, lose their baby either as an egg or infant. Regardless, these beautiful birds live with a single determination to propagate their kind - to live for the next generation. It is something that we, as humans, seem to have lost interest in as we become more and more concerned with our own personal achievements to the detriment of our children.<br /><br />I was profoundly touched by the apparent agony that the male and female birds feel when they lose their offspring. I was further touched with the dedication that the male birds have to babysitting the egg and the hatchlings as they wait - going without food for up to four or five months - for their mate to return from feeding.<br /><br />March of the Penguins is definitely family friendly. However, one of the bonus tracks may not be. It more completely shows the horrors that these birds encounter each day and what the real death tolls are as the penguins wrestle with the elements, each other, and predators. When you see the dead birds/eggs littering the mating/hatching ground it is painful. Watching an abandoned or orphan hatchling freeze to death is painful. Be careful that your children don't see this bonus track at too young an age - though its reality should be a wake up call to many pre-teen kids so they can become aquainted with the reality of death.<br /><br />Brilliant and difficult filmmaking make this film very worthy of watching/purchasing.</p></body></html>

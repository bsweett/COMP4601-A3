<meta name="summary" content="In a  Great Film Tradition"></head><body><p>Around the time in which Perdition is set (1931). Robinson ( Little Caesar), Cagney (Public Enemy) and Muni (Scarface) were making the mold for the gangster picture which Bogart, Raft, Ladd, Widmark, and many others filled with their particular style and talents. Here we have truly 1931 brutality in a studied 2002 manner. In a supporting role (though receiving star billing), Paul Newman gives an Actors Master Class performance, Tom Hanks, the star, bulked up to increase his menace, subdues it to businesslike killing, while the rest of the cast is exceptionally good. Costuming is effectively period, while the music enhances the  unrolling plot at every point. While nothing is outside the stereotypes set by 1931, the plot and tone of the film are redolent of the contemporary mood. If the genre appeal to you, this is a worthwhile way to spend your time.</p></body></html>

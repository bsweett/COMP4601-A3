<meta name="summary" content="Not a Bad Movie, just not Good  Star Trek"></head><body><p>The film is Good Fun. It is a great Story, and the FX and production is what make this film superb. The DVD has HEAPS of great Extras, and very good Detail.<br /><br />Frakes was not the first choice for director, even he says that they were hoping for a bigger, better action director.But, Frakes got the job. And its hard to go wrong with a stellar cast, especially a cast that influences the script ( Stewart made considerable story "suggestions" that shifted the balance of the story flow).<br /><br />As a film, yes it is good, but as a Star Trek film, I would rate this  even less than Star Trek 5, and its problems were  enormous. By all accounts the production of FIRST CONTACT was a breeze in comparison.<br /><br />And the great thing is that you decide how you feel on all these issues, because the two disc set is extremely comprehensive in basically  all  areas of the film.<br /><br />Love the Role  Alice Krige plays, but hey, I would see a film with her in it, same  way I would watch anything  by Sandra Bullock.</p></body></html>

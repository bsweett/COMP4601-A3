I didn't catch much, but something tells me I really didn't need to see more than I did.  First off, it's directed by a guy who uses only one name to address himself.  That's a big no-no, especially if you're a nobody.  Second, and this is the most valid point:  How in the hell can you take an insanely sexy concept like Catwoman and an insanely sexy woman like Halle Berry and completely screw it up so it isn't sexy at all??  Only Hollywood can.</p></body></html>

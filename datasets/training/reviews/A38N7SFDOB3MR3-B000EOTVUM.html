<meta name="summary" content="Quality Horror Movie. 87 out of 100."></head><body><p>I am more than slightly stumped at the 3 star average for Wolf Creek. I have seen more than my share of bad acting and choppy film making in my day, and Wolf Creek was far from bad. Without looking at what other's wrote, here goes:<br /><br />Wolf Creek is a refreshing and somewhat unique horror movie set in Australia. 3 partiers set off across the country, and end up in need of help in a very remote location. It is here that the story begins.<br /><br />While none of the story elements are unique (car breaking down, young post-teens, remote country hick killer, etc), the execution is perfect. Wolf Creek had me scared, and on the edge of my seat. There are few horror movies that have done this to me. I was totally immersed in the film.<br /><br />The acting was amazing and completely believable. The actor's fear became our terror. Your heart will race when the victims are being pursued. The filmmaking was top notch as well. Despite the low budget, the lighting and feel of the movie is creepy and does nothing but add to the terror.<br /><br />The best part of the film for me are the locations. The killer's hangout is quite unique, and definately not a place I would like to visit.<br /><br />Wolf Creek does an amazing job of selling the story as a completely plausable situation. I could believe that these events really could happen, regardless of whether they actually did or not. Wolf Creek doesn't turn the villain into a bad-dialogue shouting goon, and doesn't turn the victims into cliches.<br /><br />Please also note that this film does not rely on gore or torture as fear tactics. While there are a couple of glimpses at other dead victims, Wolf Creek does not try to shock you through gore; it frightens you with the story.<br /><br />Of all the horror movies I have seen in my life, and I have seen many, I would rank Wolf Creek in the top 5 overall. With a great combination of pitch, acting, feel and (of course) fear, Wolf Creek will not disappoint. I don't have a clue why this film received low ratings: this is no Freddy vs. Jason, or Jason is space. Try Wolf Creek, you won't regret it.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 90<br /><br />47 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />9 (out of 10). Acting.

Is this movie a must buy/purchase?</p></body></html>

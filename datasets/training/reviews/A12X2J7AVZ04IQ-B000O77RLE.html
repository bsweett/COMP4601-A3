I'm not averse to sub-titles, and  the simple screenplay gets the point across. It's always healthy to get a different viewpoint, and understanding the futility of the Japanese faction was very well displayed. No one is spared; the Japs and Americans alike were guilty of brutality. There have been other films that have presented war from the other side ("The Bridge", Germany, 1960, and "Ballad of a Soldier", USSR, 1961, and others I'm sure...), but by virtue of Mr. Eastwood's participation, this is a very American film. It's good to know that a smart American has made a film to show the passion, heartaches and love that is left behind in time of war without issue.The acting is outstanding. Ken Watanabe is the most well-known and has garnered the most attention, but there are fine performances from Tsuyoshi Ihara (as Nishi, the former Olympian), and especially Kazunari Ninomiya as Saigo, the real star. He is wonderful, and covers every corner of every emotion. The single-disc DVD has absolutely NO extras, and I was disappointed.It is a fine, thoughtful anti-war film that is worthy of everyone's attention...if you take the time to absorb. Previous reviewers were bored, but the film demands attention; giving it that attention will give you a very fine film experience. Just another big feather in Mr. Eastwood's cap.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Shoot First, Talk Later"></head><body><p>I like westerns and I like this film but I admit this is a bit hard-edged. It took me a couple of viewings to appreciate it. It's a tough movie with a good cast and no nonsense. The characters in here aren't the talk-now-shoot-later variety. There are a few memorable and very tense scenes in this film, and a good share of profanity, too.<br /><br />Watching the likes of Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman as the three main stars, however, is pretty entertaining. How often are those charismatic actors NOT entertaining?<br /><br />Overall, a rough film but a pretty solid western which would have been probably better and accepted by the public better had the language been toned down.</p></body></html>

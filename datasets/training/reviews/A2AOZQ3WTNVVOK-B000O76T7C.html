It appeared that science fiction had been significantly reinvigorated by new technology.  We watched "Jaws" a few years earlier, and it similarly reinvigorated the monster genre.  "Alien" brought the two genres back together.<br /><br />"Alien" commercials showing in 1979 and 1980 were bizarre; a black screen where portions of the title slowly revealed themselves.  The commercials promised something new and different and horrific.  The commercials were hardly sufficient.<br /><br />Space freighter Nostromo was carrying its cargo on a return trip home whenever the spaceship received a signal that caused the ship to wake its crew.  The crew journeys to a nearby planet to discover that the signal is from a derelict ship that may have crash landed centuries earlier.  As the crew explores the ship they encounter a room filled with strange pods.  One of the crew members, Kane (John Hurt), looks into the pod, only to have thing come flying out of the pod and attach itself to his face.  The crew on the ground packs Kane back into their shuttlecraft and return to the Nostromo.<br /><br />Once Kane is in the Nostromo's sick bay the crew removes his space suit and attempts to remove the thing attached to his face.  However, it is evident that the thing will kill Kane if the crew tries to remove it.  The crew awaits further developments.  A routine check of sick bay reveals the thing is off Kane's face, and Kane soon rouses, seemingly as good as ever, and hungry!  The crew also finds the thing, dead, and Ash (Ian Holm), the ship's android, examines the thing.  Kane begins to eat breakfast, only to discover some really, really extreme gastric distress.<br /><br />After a relatively small alien takes its leave of Kane in one of the most disturbing and memorable scenes in the history of film, the crew try to track down the alien.  However, they soon find that the little alien is now a huge monstrosity with an exoskeleton and acid for blood, and a seemingly endless appetite.  They also discover that the alien is extremely intelligent, apparently inheriting substantial knowledge.<br /><br />The remainder of the movie is an incredible cat and mouse game between the crew and the alien, with each and every encounter more chilling and frightening than the last, as the crew tries to deal with a creature outside anyone's experience.  The end of the movie remains a powerful testimony to Ridley Scott's directing abilities.  Those who saw the movie more than once in the theater or have the movie on DVD can easily see the alien well in advance of Ripley, allowing us to feel the fear of the impending encounter in advance of Ripley.<br /><br />This movie featured a cast of well-known actors and soon-to-be stars, most notably Tom Skerritt as Dallas and Sigourney Weaver as Ripley.  Ripley dominates this movie as the type-A leader who fights the alien every step of the way, all the way to the end.  Yaphet Kotto, Veronica Cartwright and Harry Dean Stanton round out the human crew.<br /><br />This movie set a new standard for monster movies and for science fiction.  The characters were believable and three dimensional.  The sets were superb; incredibly fantastic visions including the art of H.R. Giger.  The music contained substantial sub-woofer, making the listener feel intensely uncomfortable to enhance the more intense scenes.  The traditional haunted house or creepy village was replaced by a spaceship from which there was no escape.  Spicing up the plot is a subplot involving Ash and the company that owns the Nostromo.<br /><br />Take your blood pressure medicine before watching this one on your big screen with home theater sound.</p></body></html>

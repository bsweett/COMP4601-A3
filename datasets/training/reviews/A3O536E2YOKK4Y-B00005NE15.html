Catching it again recently, however, I was impressed by quite a few things:<br /><br />-- The film has MOOD. Carpenter successfully captured a fitting spooky atmosphere for his ghost story. (The plot involves the horrific ghosts of a ship of lepers returning to enact revenge on a coastal community 100 years after the people of that village guided them to a rocky death in order to swipe their chest of gold).<br /><br />The spooky mood is nicely captured in the very first scene wherein John Houseman shares the ghost story to a group of kids at a campfire on the coast.<br /><br />-- Spectacular locations. The picture was filmed in the beautiful Point Reyers/Bodega Bay region North of San Francisco.<br /><br />-- Fabulous Score. Especially the main piano piece that runs during the end credits. It actually blows away the more popular main score to Capenter's "Halloween."<br /><br />-- Good Cast, which includes Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Hal Holbrook, Nancy Kyes and Janet Leigh.<br /><br />-- An unpredictable finish. I know this is a horror flick and people are supposed to die, but it's nice to see people NOT die for a change. It's refreshing!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a fast-paced slasher gore-fest, you will not like this film. If, however, you're in the mood for something spooky, atmospheric and aesthetically pleasing, "The Fog" will likely trip your trigger.</p></body></html>

The biggest complaint I have about the movie has to do with the complexity of the plot: two thirds into the film I had no idea what exactly Indy was going after. Remember how in Raiders every bit of the way you felt how critical it was for Indy to get the Ark ? Not here. As a result I just didn't care too much about what was going on. I also don't think Shia LaBeouf has the chops for inheriting the Indiana Jones role, I have no idea who does but certainly not him. I suppose you just can't expect Spielberg and Lucas to catch thunder in a bottle every time (see Raiders) so one has to value this new film for what it is: a good time at the movies, nothing more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Incredibles"></head><body><p>Because of a lawsuit, Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) and his wife Helen (Elastigirl) are forbidden to continue being superheroes.  When Mr. Incredible gets the opportunity to be a superhero again, he jumps at the chance.  What he doesn't know is that this is just a trick to have him destroyed by his worst enemy.  Now, it's up to the Incredibles to save him from the terrible Buddy Pine<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie a lot because it is very humorous, and some parts were absolutely hilarious.</p></body></html>

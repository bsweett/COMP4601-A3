The reason why I say this is because I think (if this is possible) there was too much gore in this movie. I know that is kind of the point of a horror movie, but I think Rob Zombie went over board.<br />However, it was cool to see Mike Myers again!! Lets hope that Halloween 2 (directed by Rob Zombie) turns out better.</p></body></html>

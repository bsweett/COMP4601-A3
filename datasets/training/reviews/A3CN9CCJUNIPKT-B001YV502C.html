<meta name="summary" content="Chilling dystopian sci-fi, with a tart sense of humor"></head><body><p>I am a fan of dystopian-future movies, and this is certainly one of the most chilling -- and plausible -- that I have seen.  The year is 2027 and a series of cataclysmic disasters has brought humanity to the brink: New York City has been nuked, famine and political upheaval have uprooted civil society across the planet, and for nearly twenty years the human race has been rendered sterile. Ah, but there will always be an England... In this case, it's an Orwellian-fascist state riddled with violence and paranoia, with a refugee crisis that threatens to topple the fragile underpinnings of a brutal police state.  The film is very dark, but has a mordant sense of humor that is its savings grace.  It's also directed in a half-dreamy style that curiously undercuts the action-movie cliches -- a car chase takes place with in a broken hatchback that our hero is trying to bump-start, as the bad guys chase him on foot; later he loses his shoes and runs through the rubble wearing only a pair of plastic flip-flop sandals.<br /><br />All in all, this was a very effective, but inherently frightening view of the future.  Definitely worth checking out.</p></body></html>

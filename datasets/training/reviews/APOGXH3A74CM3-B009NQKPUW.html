<meta name="summary" content="Only skin deep"></head><body><p>This film is a visual beauty, it really is, but that beauty is only skin deep when it comes to the story.  The plot has too many holes and gaps for the viewer to fill in.  There's no clear motivation for the actions of the characters, stretching the story way beyond any credible suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />The film glosses over the philosophical questions it started off trying to answer, coming off as more of an existential mess.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Ridley Scott, he's truly brilliant, so maybe my expectations for this film were too high.  Some of the Alien franchise movies are true classics, but that sadly won't be the case with this film.<br /><br />Something went terrible wrong with the story.  I'm sure I'll see this film again, it really is a visual joy, but sadly not as good of a story is it could have, and should have been.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pixar continues its tradition of making great animated films"></head><body><p>Pixar continues the tradition of defining the creative and technical standards of feature-length computer animated motion pictures that it started with "Toy Story" back in 1995. What makes this film unique, like all Pixar movies, is that technical detail is used to accentuate a great comic script with heart. I would say other computer animated movies do the reverse, but then I would be saying that they have great scripts with heart, which they generally don't. Like all Pixar films there is something here for the whole family, the kids can enjoy it for the shear comic spectacle, such as when Remy the rat discovers he can control the boy Linguini like a marionette by pulling hairs under his hat and thus cook meals via remote control, and the adults can enjoy the comedy plus the irony of a rat who dreams of preparing fine food and how sometimes your own personal dreams can clash with family loyalty and society's expectations. Highly recommended. Extra features include:<br /><br />Deleted Scenes - With introductions by Ratatouille's acclaimed screenwriter/director Brad Bird.<br /><br />"Your Friend the Rat" - Remy and Emile star in an all-new animated short film.<br /><br />Fine Food and Film: A Conversation with Brad Bird and Thomas Keller - Cuisine and cinema come together in this behind the scenes look at how master chef and restaurateur Thomas Keller brought his real life expertise to the table.<br /><br />Lifted - In Pixar's latest short, Oscar nominated for Best Animated Short Film, a teen alien learns that failure is an option.<br /><br />Note that Pixar has been making great animated short films since ten years before the release of "Toy Story" and that a collection of 13 of their animated shorts dating back to their first in 1984 is due to be released on DVD the same day as this film. The only drawback is that "The Pixar Short Films Collection" will contain "Lifted", which is also on this DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Beware The 'Devil's Hour'"></head><body><p>This is a very special movie, probably the first film ever to deal honestly with the subject of demonic possession from a purely Christian perspective without all the usual special effects. Based on a true 20th century account, 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' chronicles the unfortunate tale of a young college girl who had the misfortune of being too sensitive and caring. Traits that apparently attract spiritual evil and can leave one vulnerable and susceptible to demonic attack and ultimately possession.<br /><br />Are demons real and can one become possessed by the spirits of evil? The makers of this film think so. So do I.<br /><br />Excellent performances by Laura Linney, Scott Campbell and of course Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose.</p></body></html>

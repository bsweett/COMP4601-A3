<meta name="summary" content="disappointing"></head><body><p>when i heard that director quenten tarantino was going to make a film about nazis i was estatic!my brain was buzzing with the possibilities!a director known for his extremely gory and violent films is going to make a nazi movie!nazi movies are notorious for being ultra violent.this would no doubt be the "a clockwork orange" of the new millenium!the movie that was decades ahead of its time.it would be considered too violent even in 30 years.<br />  BUT NO!It was not that violent.it was a bunch of long talking scenes,reading most of the film because it was in german and french and a couple cool fight scenes.<br />  a lot of hype was being built up around the "baseball bat scene".well,ive scene worse violence on "tom and jerry".the scene was over in like 10 seconds  after the 10 minute build up to a highly anti-climatic ending.it was being talked about like it was going to be an all time great movie scene like meg ryan faking an orgasm at the deli.but it was hype and hype only.like they say "everything in hollywood is so fake".<br />  then when there were no action scenes it was all talk.so the movie went talk talk talk talk talk talk.........baseball bat scene........talk talk talk talk talk talk...........nazis.......talk talk talk talk talk........movies...........talk talk talk talk ..........big finale!<br />  there was very little violence.and even less ultra violence.<br />  the actors and actresses were a bunch of people i am mostly unfamiliar with.there was brad pitt who did ok i guess.the chick from "sweeny todd" may have shown up briefly too.the guy who played hitler was paid 3 pennies because thats all he was worth in this film.<br />  also,when all of the nazis were supposed to meet up,a bunch of the big wigs were missing.it was incredibly historicaly innaccurate.the facts were all messed up.especially the end which took the film into an alternate reality.<br />  the violence that was done to the nazis was the same type of stuff that they allegedly did to  thier victims in ww2,making the  so called "good guys" no better than the nazis.<br />  this was supposed to be quenten tarantinos masterpiece.his "mona lisa" or "moonlight sonata".he said it was the film he'd always wanted to make.he'd been planning it for ten years he said.<br />  the childish "get the nazi" antics  that are all too common in movies ever since the 2o's are just plain stupid.they are way too played out in this movie.and if this "masterpiece" was aimed at that juvenile approach and aimed at redefining himself as a snoozer film maker,than he suceeded.<br />  this movie could have been the ultimate ww2 film of all time.easily beating out any ww2 or skin head film in existence.but what it did accomplish was a half baked,watered down,movie that has gone places hundreds of movies already have.<br />  ww2 was bad.the nazis did bad things.everyone knows.so all these childish pokes at someone who cant fight back ,without a time machine, are just infantile.grow up ! try complaining about something from the last half a century!get with the times!you'd think with that gigantic head of his he'd be able to think up the next citizen kane!</p></body></html>

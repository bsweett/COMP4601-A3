In a time when I Know What You Did Last Summer, Scream and The Sixth Sense are thought of as "horror" films, it's pleasing to see an honest, back-to-basics horror film like this.  The only other one this year being House Of 1000 Corpses.  This movie has it's shortcomings, but I like the effort.  This movie's basically a Frankenstein-type movie in the sense that it's made up of pieces and ideas(sometimes whole scenes!) from other "last people on earth" horror movies.  There are pieces of Dead Alive, Night/Dawn/Day Of The Dead, The Stand, The Quiet Earth, Demons, The Crazies and the Resident Evil game to name a few.  Yes, we all know that a guy wakes up from a coma to realize that he's left in a city of living dead monsters.  He teams up with a few other survivors, ends up at a mansion with some soldiers, tra-la, tra-la.  Naturally, these military guys have a sinister agenda, but that's not much of a surprise coz the military ALWAYS does in this kind of film.  The "zombies" aren't the Romero ones you're used to, they don't even eat anyone really.  They're infected with rage, so they like to beat, claw, stomp, strangle, puke up blood, etc.  They actually look and act alot like the demons from Lamberto Bava's Demons films(minus the claws and fangs of course).  I have three main gripes with this: 1)  The streets aren't cluttered with cars like they should be(with the exception of the tunnel).  A massacre like this would leave abandoned cars all over the city, but I guess the zombies moved them or something, coz our heroes have a clear path everywhere they drive.  2).  I don't care what anyone says, but a happy ending in this kind of film leaves a real bad taste in my mouth.  3)  It's a little more flashy and stylish than this kind of film should be.  Is it scary?  Depends on how many of the aforementioned films you've seen.  The "scares" here consist of zombies suddenly crashing through windows or doors, making the audience mess their trousers and leaving them looking around to see if anyone saw them jump.  That's about as scary as it gets if you're fluent in zombie flicks.  If you're not, it can go either way.  I've heard people say it's very scary and others say it's dumb, so I can't answer that one.  It's got a great and scary concept though.</p></body></html>

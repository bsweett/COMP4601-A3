<meta name="summary" content="What lies!"></head><body><p>"What lies beneath" is a taut thriller about a picture-perfect couple (Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer) Their only child is off to college, and everything seems to be okay. They still make passionate love, all is well with the world. Pfeiffer soon experiences eerie hauntings. She thinks she's going off the deep end. Ford appears to be supportive.<br /><br />"What lies beneath" superbly shows a marriage falling apart. Miranda Otto,who's otherwise famous as Eowyn "I am no man!" stars one of the next door neighbors that Pfeiffer fears for. It's nice to see Otto playing a comic role to balance out the grim subject matter.<br /><br />"What lies beneath" peels away its layers like an onion. Pfeiffer learns of her husband's dalliance with a student, and things turn for the worse. Ford is pitch-perfect as the narcissistic,and ultimately creepy, husband. What lies beneath... are many lies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Plot that Kind of Gets Bizarre"></head><body><p>Twilight zone meets A Beautiful Mind. Explores the psychic connection that some mothers have with their children. Glad to see that the "mother bear" archetype is alive and well but the plot makes a shaky transition from psychodrama to Twilight Zone/Psi Factor/X-Files. Julianne Moore is superb but the writing doesn't make the connections between the parallel realities.</p></body></html>

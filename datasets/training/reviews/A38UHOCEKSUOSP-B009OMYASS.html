The level of gore and grossness that Eli Roth brought into this film was shocking, explicit and the most outrageous I had ever seen on screen.  Though there have been many films in the past that have done even worse, Hostel has a more realistic feel to it - and I felt I was actually in the film upon initial watch.  Scary thing.  After awhile, I decided to give it another try.  I am glad I did.  I missed out on a very satisfying ending, and more, realizing there is a film here beneath all the gore and blood.<br /><br />The other thing that got on my nerve the first time I saw Hostel was the ongoing sex and nudity throughout the first 30 minutes of the film.  But, I realized the characters are college boys, and that's just what they do best.  Now whatever the message Roth was sending out with this film or what some people get out of it, I saw a simple message clear as day - trust no one - especially in a foreign country.  And if something is too good to be true, it usually is.  That's what happens with these young men.  And the fact that they are American makes it even worse - there are people that pay handsomely to see Americans suffer, and that's where the real guts (so to speak) of this movie lies.  Torture scenes are brutal and inventive, and will leave a mark (on the viewer too!).  After a few viewings, it seems mild now but still has a very scary element to it each time I watch.  I would have to say its Roth's use of the camera and lighting, and the dark setting where this takes place that makes it so creepy every time I watch.<br /><br />This unrated director's cut contains two verison of the film - thank God.  The original, as seen in theatres, is fortunately there too.  The reason I say fortunately is because the alternate ending on the cut version was very dissapointing - and not satisfying at all like the original.  Fortunately, here you get both.  This dvd is still worth the buy to see the difference between the two endings.<br /><br />I felt dirty and I took a shower - thats how I felt coming home from the theatre that night.  But its ok, its just a movie.  It still has its morals - good defeats evil in the end.  Give it a second try if you haven't yet, all that gore really blocks us from seeing a deeper picture at first.  If you have not seen this yet, watch with caution.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Characters - 3.5<br />Gore - 4.5<br />Story - 3.5<br />Overall - 4</p></body></html>

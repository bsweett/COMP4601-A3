Robin plays Sy Parrish a very lonely<br />man who wants nothing more than to be part of a perfect<br />family. ENTER THE YORKINS!  The husband and wife have<br />that perfect smile and have a son who does no wrong.<br />Sy has developed their pic. since the birth of their son.<br />11yrs. total,but when the husband cheats on his wife that<br />is when this movie kicks into SCARY gear! For Sy does not<br />like that and what Sy does not like.........<br />This is a very good movie and easily one of Robin's best<br />performances(I prefer Robin controlled in his movies like<br />this and the brilliant World According to Garp as oppose<br />to the yelling obnoxious Good Morning Vietnam roles) There<br />are very SPOOKY moments for me in this movie. And for GORE<br />hounds where else can you see Robin's eyes popping out<br />with tons of blood I'll tell ya! In this movie. One<br />Hour Photo is Scary because unlike Frankenstein and<br />the Wolf Man there are Sy's out there.  I really<br />enjoyed this movie and thought the supporting cast especially<br />the actor who plays Robin's Boss did a fine job. The most<br />SCARIEST part for me was not shown in the film. But I could<br />not help but keep asking myself during the movie WHAT HAPPENED<br />TO SY TO BE LIKE THIS?  I mean he had to have had a mother<br />what happened to her?  A father?  It is never explained<br />and I feel that is a good thing. I'm one who loves<br />guts and arteries thrown in my face.  But I can also appreciate<br />the not seeing and not knowing as well.  One Hour Photo<br />I am proud to own and have in my HAUNTING coll. of DVD'S.</p></body></html>

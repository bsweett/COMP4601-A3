<meta name="summary" content="Much better movie experience than its twin, "Flags of Our Fathers"..."></head><body><p>Where Clint's production of the best-selling book by James Bradley about the Iwo Jima fight came off as slightly disappointing, his retelling of the battle from the doomed Japanese soldier's point of view is brilliant. I normally do not like subtitles, but here the story is so interesting that the titles are just a minor annoyance. This one deserves the honors it brought to Eastwood, and to the major actors in it. The emotional wallop here is what eluded Eastwood when he recreated the American side of the month-long fight on that island in 1945. If you care about World War II, this is a "must see." If you hate the Japanese for the cruelty of their troops, and for their stubborn refusal to surrender even when battle outcomes were obvious, this film explains their reasoning. It will not convert you to their side, of course, but it does humanize their patriots. Watch both "Flags of Our Fathers" and "Letters from Iwo Jima" in the same week, and you will be a graduate of a mini-course in the psychology and horrors of war from two different major world cultures.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HOMER'S AN OK SCREENWRITER"></head><body><p>My wife and I saw TROY on the big screen with good friends, a highly educated MD and his wife.  The good doctor walked out in a huff after only an hour because he felt Homer's "Iliad" was being "desecrated by Hollywood."  We three stayed and enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />And I like the DVD even more.<br /><br />Wolfgang Peterson fully captures the grand scale of events that engage Greek warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt), Trojan Prince Hector (Eric Bana) lovers Paris (Orlando Bloom) and Helen (Diane Kruger) in a war that launched a thousand ships to recover a pretty face.<br /><br />Admittedly, it's a little jarring accepting Pitt as Achilles. He's oiled up, precisely coiffed and often photographed in golden light like a pin up.  But he's very fine in the action scenes and choreographed battles -- especially the final duel with hector. And Pitt gives it his all and almost holds his own in an emotionally pivotal scene with Peter O'Toole.  Eric Bana is a much more forceful presence than Pitt but it's O'Toole who steals every scene he's in as Troy's King Priam.<br /><br />Surprisingly, there's no commentary from Peterson and stars Pitts and Bana. It wouldn't surprise me if there's a "special colelctor's edition" DVD coming out next year. I hope it includes something -- anything at all, really -- from Peter O'Toole and Julie Christie.<br /><br />Limited extras do include: "In The Thick of Battle," a fine featurette on the battle sequences and the training of warrior extras. "From Ruins to Reality" explores how the remains of ancient Troy were unearthed and how the production designers created their own version of the legendary city.  "Troy: An Effects Odyssey" looks at some of the stunning visual effects and the creation of the effective sound design.  There's also a 3-D tour of Mount Olympus in the "Gallery of the Gods" where we meet the fabled Greek Gods that play an important part in Homer's poem but are missing (thankfully) from the movie.  There's a brief, informative monologue that goes with each semi animated god or goddess.<br /><br />Even with mixed reviews, "Troy" grossed over $491 million worldwide.  Not too bad.  The audience doesn't lie.<br /><br />And I bet Homer would approve of his 3,200 year old poem being part of our pop culture.  I say it's great to see the "Iliad" as a glorious cinematic extravaganza (even without the gods).<br /><br />The transfer and sound are stunning.<br /><br />If you like widescreen epics, you will enjoy Troy on DVD.</p></body></html>

It is basically about the way interfering with memories can result in something bad - ie. The Butterfly Effect & Total Recall.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Jim Carrey playing the funny man in movies, then I suggest you don't see this movie, unless you're interested in seeing him play a relatively different role. What shocked me was his appearance in this. He looked really old. It's these bags under his eyes, and grooves down the side of his mouth, and the hair was unwashed, and he was unshaven a lot of the time.<br /><br />The start credits don't start until 17 minutes into the movie which is a very cool effect. There is one main story, the love between Clementine (Kate Winslet wearing a wide selection of wacky wigs) and Joel, and an underlying story between Kirsten Dunst's character, and the doctor of Lacuna Inc. Which seemed pretty much pointless, as there was no incline that they had a "past", and suddenly it just happens for no reason. But I suppose if you haven't seen this movie, then expect the unexpected.<br /><br />There are quite a few scenes which were cut out of the script for this movie, which I reckon would have been very interesting. The original script featured a cut beginning and ending sequence that took place in the future. In the end, an older Clementine comes in to have the procedure done and a look at her screen shows that she's had the procedure done multiple times and all of them involved Joel. At the very end of the script, an older Joel calls Clementine to ask why she hasn't called, but the technicians performing the procedure erase his message. Other cuts in the original script include a montage of memories people wanted erased, including a soldier seeing his dead friend on a battlefield and a girl who was raped at a young age. Another sub plot dropped from the script was Mary ( Kirsten Dunst) finding out that Howard made her get an abortion after they had the affair resulting in her desire to have her memory wiped.<br /><br />If you look at your DVD collection and find mostly rom-coms (not me of course!) then this is the DVD for you to get. It's certainly a romance with a twist. I can't say I was that keen on Jim Carrey not playing the funny guy. And he had TWO assistants listed in the credits, plus hair and makeup people who weren't needed! This will also get you thinking, as I know for certain, if I went through this procedure, I would lose quite a few years of my life! Imagine all those memories, just gone.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Thriller With Zero Thrills..."></head><body><p>I liked it better last year when it was called The Manchurian Candidate...and even that wasn't so hot<br /><br />Everyone seemed to like Kidman in this, I thought she was trying too hard.  I recently saw Cold Mountain and hated her in that too.<br /><br />Maybe it was just her stupid character.  "I grew up in Africa, my parents were killed by landmines; I work for the UN because I believe in the power of words over violence" etc.etc...good lord...<br /><br />But she's not the problem, Penn's not the problem.  The problem is there is no plot.<br /><br />What happens?  Nothing!<br /><br />Why are critics calling this a "smart political thriller?"<br /><br />Essentially all it really is is a blue-eyed blonde-haired woman being hunted...and then not hunted...and then maybe hunted again by some black men with guns.<br /><br />The U.N., the African leaders, the terrorism, the poetry...it's all just a superfluous nonsense shell covering the cookie-cutter creamy turd centre.<br /><br />There's going to be an assassination.  Who is behind it?  Does Kidman have something to do with it?<br /><br />Who cares?<br /><br />And that's without mentioning the completely ridiculous romantic aspect...<br /><br />It fails on all levels.  Action?  None.  Romance?  None.  Comedy?  None.  Drama?  None.  Thrills?  None.<br /><br />There is nothing...<br /><br />An awful film<br /><br />Actually there were 2 cool lines in the movie, here they are:<br /><br />"Vengeance is just a lazy form of grief"<br /><br />and<br /><br />"The smallest whisper can be heard over the largest army when it speaks the truth."<br /><br />There, I saved you 10 bucks...</p></body></html>

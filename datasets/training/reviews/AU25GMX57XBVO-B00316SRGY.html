<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood's Final Shinning Moment"></head><body><p>It appears this might be eastwood's final staring role in a movie and what a great way to end a long successful career.  Gran Torino has a little of everything to satisfy most movie buffs.  A well written story line with some action, suspense, humor and even maybe a few tears for the soft hearted.  I guess the film touches me personally since I was born and from the Detroit area but brings awareness the issues of gang's in many big metropolitan areas of the country.  As a lone solider, eastwood takes on these gangs with his own brand of justice.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></body></html>

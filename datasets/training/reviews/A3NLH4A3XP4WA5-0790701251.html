<meta name="summary" content="A realistic, well directed film"></head><body><p>A good story about a group of men slowly being torn apart by the horrors  of war.  Opening with a mezmorizing scene at the Marine Corps training  camp, and the gut-wrenching Drill Instructor which constantly beats the  platoon into a pulp, is the most realistic training scence that I have ever  viewed.  This film should be viwed by anyone with a serious passion for war  films and Nam history, NOT a family film.</p></body></html>

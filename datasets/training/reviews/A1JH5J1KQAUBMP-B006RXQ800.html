<meta name="summary" content="Watchable nonsense"></head><body><p>Martin Scorcese's epic tale of gang warfare in New York at the time of the Civil War is an overblown, exaggerated account that is very watchable but ultimately fails as a cohesive story.  I don't doubt that much of what happens in this film is inspired by fact, but I don't think that the actual participants looked quite as much like the cast of &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; as do the characters in this film.  Take, for example, the main villain, William Cutting AKA Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis).  One of his eyes is a steel ball with an American eagle on it; he cut out the original to present as a gift to the man who gave him a magnificent beating.  There's also a woman who has filed her teeth into fangs.  And a guy whose club is notched to commemorate his victims.  Star Leonardo DiCaprio's father (Liam Neeson) wore a priest's collar even as he marched into battle.<p>I have come to expect gritty realism from Scorcese, but in this film he goes way over the top.  The enormous (and surprisingly well-lit) catacombs and cavernous interiors with ratty characters hanging from bamboo scaffolding seem like left-over shots from &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot;.  It often seems like a film made by a much less skillful director who is willing to sacrifice the reality of his scenario for a cool effect, a bit of dramatic posing, or some easy violence.</p></body></html>

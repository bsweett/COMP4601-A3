This movie finally got a decent DVD treatment and we can all now release a big sigh of relief. It's here. Haven't seen the movie before?. Well, forget about "It's A Wonderful Life" or "Miracle On 34th Street", because this is the quintessential holiday movie. No buts about it. The movie was adapted from a short story by author Jean Shepard, from his book,"In God We Trust:All Others Pay Cash". It tells the story of little Ralphie Parker(Peter Billingsley), a young kid who has one wish this holiday season. He wants nothing more than a Daisy Brand Red Ryder BB Gun all wrapped up in a big bow under the Christmas tree come Christmas morning. It turns out to be more of an ordeal than Ralphie expected, when he keeps getting told that it's dangerous and he'll "shoot you're eye out". The rest of the family is made up with dad(the great Darren McGavin), a curmudgeonly man who spends a lot of time battling the neighbor dogs, and their unstable furnace. Mom(the great as well, Melinda Dillon), is a typical housewife who is kept too busy with the house and raising the family, than having any real time of her own. Little brother Randy, well, he doesn't like to eat his food, and he has a rather nasty snow outfit. The movie is about as warm and cozy as you could possibly get. It takes place in the 40's, and the filmmakers and set designers pull it off brilliantly, as it really looks and feels like that time. The acting is sharp and real. They really act like a family, and not like they are trying to pretend to be a family. The movie has a real Norman Rockwell type look and feel to it, and that only adds to it's charm. It's a very nostalgic piece, and will hit home with a lot of people. Not necessarily because of the holidays and what may go on in your house at that time, but just because of the childhood factor. The close friends, the walk to school, the bully, the grumpy pop. And, if you are old enough to of been around back then, the cars, the furniture, and the radio shows. It's just very nice. Christmas has never been more fun, more heartwarming, or more real, than in this movie. It's a classic, and an American treasure. Now, the extras. The movie comes with both widescreen and full screen. If you get it in full screen, why on earth would you want it in widescreen?. I'm so glad it came with the full screen option, for as I can't stand widescreen, and can't possibly understand how anybody can. It's a horrible thing, and ruins the movie. It doesn't add anything, but so many people have been duped into believing it does. You can't take reviewers seriously when they rate a DVD one star because the widescreen isn't good, but they also have a full screen option. Or that it only comes in full screen. Full screen is what you want!!. The other special features are a mixed bag, but all of them pleasant nonetheless. First of all, Melinda Dillon is promised to do the commentary with Billingsley. She isn't here. It's Billingsley and director Bob Clark. There is an 18 minute piece with Billingsley, Clark, and three other kids(Flick, Schwartz, and Scott Fargus), talking about their time on the movie. It's a cute feature, and it's nice to see these kids have turned out so well. There is a great piece where we get some old radio readings from Jean Shepard. It's so cool and will be nice to listen too with your tree on and a fire going. You get a trivia quiz with the actors giving questions and responses, as well as the trailer, a decoder game, and a history of the leg lamp and the red ryder gun. Those last two are quite dull, but fun to have. It would of been nicer if McGavin and Dillon and the little brother were featured too. Where were they?. All in all, it's a sharp collection, and the packaging is great, and the picture and sounds are crisp, clear and wonderful. Not a single problem here and definitley not a one star disc compared to the ludicrous other reviews. Get it today and make sure it is part of your private collection forever. I double dog dare you!!.</p></body></html>

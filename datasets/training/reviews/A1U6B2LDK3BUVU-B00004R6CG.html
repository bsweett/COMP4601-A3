I notice that the only time it seems permissible to give Vertigo less than 5 stars is if you are criticizing the DVD quality, not the movie itself.  Well, I will have to break the mold here and give the movie itself only 3 stars because of its flaws.  We have a tendency as a culture to place certain things on pedestals and not look at them critically, and Hitchcock is one of them.  It's like the story of The Emperor's New Clothes.  This movie is good, but it's not worthy of being the icon that people make it out to be.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it yet (and you are the only one left in the country who hasn't), don't read the rest of this review, because I am about to completely reveal the ending.  It is the biggest flaw in the movie.  It is terrible, not because it is sad, but because it is just plain stupid.  That was my reaction, and it was also the reaction of the person I was seeing it with.  Why?  Because it is just plain stupid.<br /><br />Judy/Madeline gets spooked by the approach of a nun, and jumps to her death.  Idiotic ending.  But it fulfills the old film adage that crime doesn't pay.  Since she had lied to our hero, and since she had been part of a murder plot, it was not permissible for her to end up in a happy marriage.  She had to die because crime doesn't pay, and she had to be punished for her lying and her complicity in a murder.  The rules had to be observed.  Reality be damned.  Reasonableness be damned.  Let her jump to her death the way the murder victim's body was thrown.  What a nice way to tie up loose ends.  Sorry, it's just too damn stupid.<br /><br />Being prepared to overrate Hitchcock, I was surprised early in the movie when Jimmy Stewart's character took a fall from a step ladder and landed oh so conveniently in the arms of his pal.  When you fall from a step ladder like that, you come crashing down, messily, probably backwards.  His fall was so staged, so unrealistic, so neat and clean.  If you have seen it, and if you have any standards of reality, this scene has to offend you for its phoniness.<br /><br />Other than that, I have to commend this movie for being interesting and giving us some good twists and turns.  But to say it is the best picture ever made, or close to it, is an insult to movies that are better.<br /><br />It all reminds me a bit of the overrating of the Hawthorne book Scarlet Letter.  It too has a foolishly unrealistic ending, and it too is overrated.  Hester Prynne, unexplainably, abandons her daughter and grandchild in England in order to return to New England where she was humiliated.  What?  What a load of nonsense.  The ending to this movie is almost as weak.  Hey Charlie, let's have the chick jump from the same place that the body was thrown from, wouldn't that be a hoot.  Yeah, great, nice neat little ending.  Come on.<br /><br />If you love this movie and want to tell me off, don't email me.  Don't do anything.  This is my opinion.  I'm entitled to it, and you are entitled to yours.  It's amazing how Amazon customers can be so opposed to freedom of speech and expression if the opinions expressed differ from their own.  Some people just don't "get" America and what it stands for.</p></body></html>

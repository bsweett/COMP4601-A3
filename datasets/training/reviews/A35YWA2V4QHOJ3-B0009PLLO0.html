<meta name="summary" content="Alexander the not-so-great"></head><body><p>Of all the people in this world, I should be one to give this movie 5 stars.  I would be thrilled to give it 5 stars.  I would love to be able to brag to people how wonderful & well done it was.  Unfortunately, I cannot ethically do any of the above.<br /><br />First a little on me.  I have studied the life of Alexander of Macedon for the past 15 years.  I've read books and essays on his life, including the biography by Arrian. I wrote a term paper on his life while in college.  I own several documentaries on his life.  I have studied the background facts of Greek culture extensively.  As I mentioned, I should have loved this movie  & in fact I wanted to love it.<br /><br />Now a little on the movie.  Somehow, it just didn't work.  Colin Farrell is a good cast for Alexander and most of the acting is decent.  The battle scenes are impressive and the soundtrack is pretty good (fittingly written by a Greek - Vangelis).  However, in the end it falls short of being worthwhile, and not even Sir Anthony Hopkins appearing as the elderly Ptolemy can change this fact.<br /><br />The basic problem with the film is that it's.....well.....boring (and my it pains me to say that!).  That a movie on Alexander's life would take 3+ hours to pull off is not surprising.  Unfortunately, this is 3+ hours of rather dull cinema.  The movie will have a spectacular battle scene and then get bogged down by some rather inconsequential aspects of Alexander's life.  Sadly, it seems to go on & on & on with some of these footnote elements.<br /><br />There are a few scenes here & there that are well done.  And, there are also some anecdotes of his life that happened kinda / sorta the way they appear in the film.  It's accurate that Alexander was bi-sexual too, but it's not necessary to hammer this fact over the head of the audience.<br /><br />In the end, if you're fascinated by the life of Alexander, this film is maybe worth seeing - once.  If not, you will probably walk out of this film thinking that his life was dull and ho-hum.  That is just too bad.  If you want to see a well-done movie on the ancient Greeks, see TROY.  It was everything this film lacked.<br /><br />If you are interested in the life of Alexander, but don't want to sit through a boring movie, I'd recommend IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF ALEXANDER by Michael Wood (available on DVD from Amazon.com).  It's a far more worthwhile depiction of his life than this.</p></body></html>

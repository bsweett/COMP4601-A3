I knew this movie wasn't going to be happy or anything, but wow. Some of the scenes were very stark and gripping, with quite a few tear-jerker moments.<br /><br />It's especially very sobering considering that this was based off a true story, and that this kind of thing still happens around the world, not just Africa. It disgusts me that people today still consider genocide an acceptable option for ANYTHING. Heck, I wouldn't know the difference between a Hutu and a Tutsi, they all looked the same to me. It truly saddens me that people are willing to kill and beat and rape just because someone's a Tutsi, even though many of them married Hutus, had children, worked and lived alongside Hutus, and never did a single dang thing against their neighbors.</p></body></html>

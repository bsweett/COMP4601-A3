Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton are both fine actors, and they both play their parts as best they could, and the storyline moves at a good pace as their two characters, clear opposites, start to form a crazy bond all it's own. The film has some great lines in this first act, ("The woman wears turtlenecks in the summer for crying out loud!") but at the hour-mark things go downhill from there, as the script takes an excellent set-up and destroys it due to terrible writing.<br /><br />The biggest offender was the play subplot. It had no purpose. It didn't build on the plot, it delayed it. It didn't change anything between Jack and Diane that hadn't already been set up in the previous scene. It's just there. It's like that guy staring at the camera in the very back of a family photo, acting like he's part of something he's not. It's the myesterious fourth act stuck between the second and third. Bottom line: it was unecessary, and if any one had handed me the script in pre-production I would have taken a big red marker and crossed out every page dealing with that subplot.<br /><br />The other big offender was the ending itself. Diane Keaton dumps Keanu Reeves for Jack Nicholson. And no, it's not a shallow thing, the Diane and Keanu character get along just fine and you feel better chemistry with them than you ever do with Diane and Jack. It was basically the writers copping out having a unique and different ending and simply saying, "Oh wait! We're making a romantic comedy. We have to have the characters get back together after twenty minutes of breaking up as per according to the official Cliche Rule Book." So enjoy as Diane dumps the perfect love interest for your average grumpy old man. I don't know any woman who would do that - and even the women watching this with me said, "Why would you go back to him?"<br /><br />So should you see this? No.</p></body></html>

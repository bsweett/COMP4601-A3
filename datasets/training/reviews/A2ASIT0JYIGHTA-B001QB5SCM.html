<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant ..."></head><body><p>IN HER SHOES is hands down the best film I've seen so far this year.  It explores the relationship between two sisters, their father and stepmother and then the grandmother they never knew as children.<br /><br />Toni Colette is brilliant as the successful sister who seems to have everything worked out right in her life except for a personal relationship.  Her biggest dilema is her useless sister (Cameron Diaz) who keeps drifting into her life and using her.  Toni is  one of the best actors out there, and it is a pleasure to see her continue to impress with each new role.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz is also very appealing in the film.  While her character is easy to dislike, it is interesting to watch as her character goes full circle.<br /><br />Shirley Maclaine plays the grandmother of the two girls, and there are some very special scenes that highlight why she is one of the greats.<br /><br />While some reviewers have called it a chick flick, I would call it a film for anyone who has experienced the ups and downs of having a sister or a brother.<br /><br />IN HER SHOES runs for over 2 hrs & 30 mins.  The film is outstanding but perhaps could have been wrapped up a little before this.  A minor complaint.  Overall, a must see for all!</p></body></html>

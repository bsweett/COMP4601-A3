<meta name="summary" content="The Worst Film of the Year?"></head><body><p>This historical drama is inspired by a true crime from 1947, the murder of Elizabeth Short. The film opens with a riot in 1945 Los Angeles. Sailors were attacking the "zoot suiters" because of a prior attack on sailors. There is a plan to stage some boxing matches to help pass a municipal bond issue. There is a domestic scene that is supposed to mean something. Some of those hats don't have the wide brims of that era. Was the fight realistic? Do those scenes of entertainment have a meaning? There is a sudden shoot-out. Next police cars arrive where a body was found. [Do those scenes inside a home look too upscale?] The internal organs of that body were removed by the killer!<br /><br />The police investigate the death of Elizabeth Short. [Does the film drag here?] Does that girl's family seem strange? "I'm really so sorry." That family is strange! Can anyone make a fortune by building cheap housing? Does the drama go downhill? The story just stumbles along from scene to scene. Does the ending seem believable? Will this movie never end? Finally there is a surprise at the end. Does it make sense? Any of them? Is that family really crazy? Will there be another cover-up? Will this movie never end? Was it the worst film of the year?<br /><br />The credits say it was based on the James Ellroy novel. The tiny lettering for the credits suggests they were ashamed to be named for this film. I'll bet the Bulgarians turn out better films for their people. This film could have benefitted from a lower budget and a better script. Was the book better than this film?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Psychic Isolation of Two Hit Men in Bruges"></head><body><p>Martin McDonagh makes an impressive writing and directing debut with the very fresh and entertaining and surprisingly well rounded film IN BRUGES.  Though the basic storyline is rather simple, McDonagh knows how to keep it turning and twisting with generous amounts of humor as well as probing character development.  He has assembled a cast of very fine actors, turned the cinematography of the gorgeous Belgian city of Bruges over to the capable creative hands of Eigil Bryld, and finished his project off with a fine musical score by the gifted Carter Burwell (with a nod to Schubert and others): the result is a beautiful little film with messages galore and always a visual treat to see repeatedly.<br /><br />Two hit men - Ken (Brendan Gleeson), a chubby, optimistic bloke who loves spending time with the sights of Bruges, and Ray (Colin Farrell), an emotionally distraught young man in the throes of guilt from a botched 'hit' that accidentally killed a young boy - have been sent by their 'boss' Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to 'lay low' after the botched murder  of a priest (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds).  It is Christmas season and there are too few rooms available so Ken and Ray reluctantly share a tiny hotel room to await further orders from Harry. Ken falls in love with the beauty of the city of Bruges while Ray, ever anxious and distrustful, finds some solace in a film being shot about 'midgets' (J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Renie) with behind the scenes girl Chlo? (Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy). How these two Irish guys make the most of their enforced isolation ultimately leads to  the real reason for their assignment, a reason that includes a last 'hit' that sweeps the audience to a surprising ending.<br /><br />McDonagh writes very well, giving some of the best comedic lines to Farrell who proves himself a fine fit for this difficult role.  Yes, it is another 'hit man film', but this one has the good fortune to deal with very real people, conflicted with their choice of 'occupation' and who are hungry to share their tenuous lives with good friends.  Though there is considerable bloody derring-do, the film uses the chase and kill scenes to good advantage, allowing the audience to feel the human side of those whose job it is to 'off' others.  Both Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are superb and their roles are enhanced by a choice selection of character actors who speed the plot along nicely.  This is a very entertaining movie, one that can be appreciated on many levels, and one that suggests that Martin McDonagh has a solid future in cinema. Grady Harp, June 08</p></body></html>

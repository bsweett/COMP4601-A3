<meta name="summary" content="Iron Lady"></head><body><p>Mery Streep gives an awesome performance as usual in this film. In Iron Lady, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is an elderly woman who suffers with dimentia. In her mental state, she frequently converses with her beloved deceased husband when no one is nearby to overhear. The movie flashes back and forth from present day to earlier times and touches on her personal life as well as her political ambitions. Scenes from her formative years as the daughter of a grocer give glimpses into the formation of her political thought. It was in this environment that she learned firsthand the value of a hard earned dollar. No doubt, that life experience contributed to her grit as an adult. The movie may be lackluster for some but I enjoyed seeing the old girl again via Meryl Streep.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Already falling into tedium"></head><body><p>When it comes to keeping a consistent plot the Halloween series has been the absolute worst. 1 and 2 follow each other okay, 3 is the joker in the pack, Return, Revenge and Curse were nothing but gibberish and H20 and Resurrection have been poor 'post-modern' exersizes in convention merely using the Halloween name.<br /><br />Right after the original Halloween ended, Laurie is taken away to get stitched up, but Michael Myers ain't quite dead yet. Much of this bore is set in a hospital as he very, very slowly goes about his killing machine business. Donald Pleasence does his mad doctor bit again spouting some crackpot dialogue in a strange, offbeat way. No one listens to him, of course and they end up dead.<br /><br />It's an okay sequel but it's marred by unbearable slowness. The pace for that particular night was already set by the first film so why slow down and build up again? Regarded as a classic far too often the first film is somewhat obselete today. But it does have one purpose: to always look good when compared to the drek of 'horror' we suffer today. This first sequel, coming a mere three years after the original, already looks tired and the thin premise is stretched to breaking point. There's no purity or class here.<br /><br />Plus it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. What happened to Jimmy? He died by gently banging his head but didn't keel over until 20 minutes later? What? Why do the credits list someone playing Michael Myers (Age 23) when he is only 21 in the film and is played by Dick Warlock? Why did he kill the Sheriff's daughter (which he does again in Revenge)?<br /><br />This new DVD from Universal improves upon the cruddy Goodtimes release by giving us a new 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and a sturdy keepcase instead of a horrid snapper. The sound is in not-bad-for-its-day Dolby Stereo. There are no features to speak of, which is annoying since Universal originally promised us commentaries, documentaries, deleted scenes etc. Pick it up cheap.</p></body></html>

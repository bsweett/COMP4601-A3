<meta name="summary" content="All I can say is finally..."></head><body><p>In celebration of the rebooting of Friday the 13th, Paramount has double-dipped their money-making slasher series for the ump-teenth time (as well as debuting on Blu-Ray), only this time around we finally get the Uncut version of the original Friday the 13th.  While the re-inserted scenes only really amount to nothing more than a few seconds of deleted gore effects, it's nice to finally have the original Friday the 13th in all its uncut glory.  There's a decent assortment of extras included on the DVD as well, including an interesting commentary from Sean S. Cunningham and some nice featurettes and recollections on what the film meant then and now.  Like it or not, Friday the 13th owns a place in horror history that has and will stand the test of time, and finally having it here in its uncut form makes that factoid all the more true.  If you're a horror buff and you don't already own one of the old discs or the box set, this Uncut version is definitely a worthy pick up.</p></body></html>

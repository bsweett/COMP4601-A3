Alas, I was disappointed in this film.  While it is beautiful to look at, "Sky Captain" has no soul.<br /><br />The storyline is mostly a conglomeration of movie serials and landmark films from the 1920s and 1930s, and there are many none-too-subtle homages to Metropolis, King Kong, Buck Rodgers, and even a small tip of the hat to Godzilla (one must look closely to see the latter).  There are also influences from 1950s films; the giant robots bear a striking resemblance to the machine from the film "Kronos", complete with antenna, circular radio waves and sound.<br /><br />The actors are of quality background, but something is missing in terms of chemistry between the two principals.  Sky Captain (Jude Law) flies around in a souped-up P-40 Warhawk fighter plane, and is joined in his adventures by Ace Reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyeth Paltrow).  Polly spends most of the film whining about this or that, and Paltrow seems a bit overwhelmed by all the bluescreens; perhaps this is because she has not worked in this kind of film before, while Law did extensive duty in an effects-loaded "A.I. Artificial Intelligence".  These two have worked together before (The Talented Mr. Ripley) with excellent results, but there is no real warmth between them in this film.  Angelina Jolie appears all too briefly as the British commander of a sort of flying aircraft carrier.<br /><br />The production design and extensive CGI effects are truly amazing, with art-deco elements throughout.  In this respect the film is a work of art, with film noir lighting even in what is supposed to be broad daylight.  One major glitch in the film in light of this is the fact that Polly takes photos in caves, deep shadows, etc. without any semblance of a flash-filmmakers who specialize in such things as lighting should certainly know better.<br /><br />Overall "Sky Captain" does have a unique look about it; I can't say I've seen a modern movie that captures the visual essence of the 1920/30s like this film does.  However, the plot is far too convoluted (simple plots being the basis of the old serials), and some of the actors seem overwhelmed by the CGI technology.  Their chops suffer somewhat as a result.  2 stars for technical achievment.</p></body></html>

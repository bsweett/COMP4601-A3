<meta name="summary" content="DVD complaint"></head><body><p>I love "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind." It's my favorite film from '04. I was eager to quickly purchase the DVD when it was first released - and I did so.<br /><br />Less than a month afterwards they announced a new 2-Disc edition, which must be the record for the shortest-ever re-release (apart from simultaneous separate editions such as the "regular" edition of Ray and the "special" edition for the die-hard fans of the film).<br /><br />At first I was very upset, and angry at the film studio for doing this. Then I saw the extra features on the 2-Disc edition:<br /><br />- Inside the Mind of Michel Gondry<br /><br />- Anatomy of a Scene: Saratoga Avenue<br /><br />- A Conversation with Kate Winslet and Director Michel Gondry<br /><br />- Deleted & Extended Scenes<br /><br />- Souvenir Booklet<br /><br />First of all, the front packaging for the new DVD is awful. It's the same as the old one, but centered, with annoying critics' reviews highlighted all over the place. Second of all, the new features are, simply put, not worth the upgrade. There's already an Anatomy of a Scene on the original disc. Once you've seen one, you get the idea. Only the most die-hard of fans would find it worth upgrading just for this. The conversation with Kate Winslet and Gondry is just as bad as teh conversation with Jim Carrey on Disc 1 - boring and not insightful at all. "Inside the Mind of Michel Gondry" was also available before and the souvenir booklet isn't anything special.<br /><br />I think this is the worst case of marketing ever. I love the movie. I'm disappointed in the DVDs - the commentary isn't very interesting, the bonus features are dull, and to my surprise the instantaneous release of the "special" edition is just as bad.<br /><br />I'd give it five stars if they hadn't tried to rip everyone off with two editions. The difference between the normal edition of Ray and the special edition is that they were announced at the same time, and put on the shelves at the same time. For those of us who bought Eternal Sunshine, we were not told until later that a Collector's Edition was going to be released - a month later of all things! - so it really upset me.</p></body></html>

As the game itself only consisted of shooting aliens it was virtually impossible for anyone to write a decent script for this movie. Obviously The Rock's acting abilities are at the right place here. Still the movie didn't turn out that bad after all. A few actors, like Karl Urban for example, still make it worthwile to keep watching. Of course they usually talk scientific nonsense all the time, but it was fun to see some people take Doom seriously, although it's an absolute IQ reducer. (SARR)</p></body></html>

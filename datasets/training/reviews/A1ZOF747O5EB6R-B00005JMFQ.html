<meta name="summary" content="Love Actually Works"></head><body><p>This is a wonderful film where 130 minutes just fly by in the blink of an eye.<p>There are many who might regard "Love Actually" as a chick flick.  Such a view is not warranted.  The film should appeal to all ages both male and female.  <p>The film, in essence, is a collection of love stories that, in there own ways, have a touching humour and resonance.  The characters are strong although it is hard to go past the ageing rocker Billy Mack.  His line about Brittney Spears is worth the price of admission on its own.<p>See this film and have great laugh!</p></body></html>

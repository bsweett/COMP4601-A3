<meta name="summary" content="10 STARS!!!"></head><body><p>This is the best sequel EVER made! This makes X-Men 1 look like Pee Wee's Playhouse. This is everything every comic book movie wasn't. This movie is PERFECT! Let me start off with the Nighcrawler scene at the beginning of the movie. That alone was the most incredible action scene EVER in a movie! The Matrix? What's the Matrix? Just about all of the characters in this movie have a balanced time on screen and they all get to show off their powers. The only one who was left out was Cyclops. But he does have more to do this time than last time. Storm gets a lot more to say and plays an important role in the outcome of the story. She still doesn't get to fly but what she does do makes up for it. Wolverine is COOL! Magneto kicks BUTT! But who is the coolest mutant in X2? MYSTIQUE!!! She went from a nobody in the first film to the most incredibly cool character in this one! When you go to see this movie be on the look out for Gambit's name on a computer screen (Remy LeBeau) and Beast on a TV screen (Hank McCoy.) This movie sets up X3's story line which should include a major role from Jean Grey. She is one of the most powerful and important characters in this movie and in the next she will probably be the most dangerous. Go see the movie. If you don't like it there's really no hope for you.</p></body></html>

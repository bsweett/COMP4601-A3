<meta name="summary" content="A Groundhog Day worth reliving (and re-watching)"></head><body><p>Groundhog Day is based on what may be the oddest premise for a romantic comedy ever.  A TV news weatherman (Bill Murray) goes to Punxatawnee, PA to cover Groundhog Day.  The next day he wakes up and it is Groundhog Day again.  No one remembers that this day has already passed and so he is forced to live it again.  And the next day he wakes up and... it's Groundhog Day again.  And again... and again... and again... and, well, you get the idea.  Watching Murray's character go through this bizarre situation and the effect it has on him is absolutely riveting.  I love that no attempt to explain this time-loop is ever made, it's enough for the viewer to know that it is happening and we don't need to get bogged down in some geeky sci fi explanation.<br /><br />Bill Murray has a tendency to be a little too smug and over-the-top in his movie performances but he is at the top of his game here.  His timing is perfect and the role harnesses his smug and biting humor but this is tempered as the story progresses and Murray captures the nuances perfectly.  The rest of the cast similarly rises to the level of the unusually intelligent script.  For my money, this is probably the single best movie in the "romantic comedy" genre.  It is unique and perfectly executed.  Well worth watching whether you are a fan of Bill Murray or not.</p></body></html>

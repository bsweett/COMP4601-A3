<meta name="summary" content="It's the ride that counts, not the destination."></head><body><p>The timing of the film's theatrical release with the latest bombshell about the JonBenet case is practically uncanny. However, as a viewing of the DVD will plainly show, the satiric critique of the Little Miss Living Doll beauty pageants is relatively contained, occupying the last 20 minutes, though the point is unmistakable. The ultra polished, talented contestants against whom the film's slightly pudgy and awkward hero, Olive, competes aren't so much little girls as miniature Las Vegas show queens, coached in seductive eye use and sexy posturing. How ironic that the manager of the beauty contest is scandalized by Olive, whose "improper" strip tease, taught to her by her grandfather, doesn't contain a hint of seduction or sexuality.<br /><br />Olive's quest to be a beauty queen appears to align her with other members of her family. Her obtuse, self-programmed father, who preaches #1 or none, wants to be a published authority on positive thinking and winning. Her suicidal, sensitive, gay uncle wants to be recognized as the world's #1 Proust scholar. Her introverted, tormented and driven brother wants to be a jet pilot in his own private Nietzschean world. Toni Collette as the mom, on the other hand, is the model of tolerance and forebearance, a supportive "gamer" whose ability to eat ice cream without guilt fortunately has a more profound effect on her daughter than the father's insistence on winning at any cost.<br /><br />By the end of the film, our family of losers ultimately emerge as true winners. Alan Arkin, as the profane patriarchal grandfather, provides the film's enduring wisdom, counseling both his son and granddaughter (Abigail Breslin deserves a supporting actress award for this scene alone) before his death about the importance of simply living life to the fullest. A real winner, he tells the family, is someone "who's not so afraid of losing he's afraid to try." It's not the destination that matters; it's the trip. And the film literally offers one hell of a ride. Apart from some raw language, this is a family film recommended for all dysfunctional families who enjoy crying as much as laughing together.<br /><br />At the same time, thanks to inventive scripting and directing, this little gem transcends the "family film" genre, providing moments of subtlety, nuance, and genuine "life." The very different, often ambivalent, responses of various members of the pageant to Olive's performance suggest that not everyone buys into the Little Miss America mentality. And again the mom is the one member of the family who has sufficient confidence in her daughter to sense that the men's concern about Olive's being "laughed at" speaks less about Olive than their own childish fears and self-consciousness.<br /><br />Finally, by making Grandpa the unlikely voice of wisdom, the film takes on universal, life-affirming resonance. "Little Miss Sunshine" counters our tendency to see living merely as a "means" to some distant end or goal. Often the means needs no justification: being fully alive in the here and now can be the biggest prize of all.<br /><br />Count this one is an all-around winner--an entertaining, formulaic movie with enough twists, vitality, heart, and thought to almost atone for all of those long, dull "Talledega Nights" which moviegoers increasingly have to endure as part of their desensitizing training.</p></body></html>

I haven't seen many of them I have to say but do intend to in the near future. Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk is one of the more recent adaptations of a Marvel Comics hero and was intended to make up for Ang Lee's version from 2003 which didn't go down well with the critics. Trying to keep my anger in check I sat myself down to take on the Hulk.<br /><br />Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is the subject of an experiment at the outset using gamma rays to increase the healing time in soldiers. The project is overseen by General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross (William Hurt) and his daughter and Banner's girlfriend Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). After the process begins Banner turns into a giant green monster, destroying the lab and leaving both General Ross and his daughter injured during his violent outburst. The film picks up years later where Bruce Banner is leading a surreptitious existence in Brazil working in a soft drinks factory and thanks to martial arts training has learned to control his anger and prevent a transformation into the Hulk for many months. General Ross is still desperately seeking Banner and turns to ageing soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) for help.<br /><br />After a destructive opening with Banner's transformation into the Hulk the film quickly moves onto his time in Brazil where he has not turned into the Hulk for months and is in contact via the Internet with Mr Blue about a cure for his condition. Banner's location is revealed when he cuts himself at work and a drop of blood, heavy set with gamma rays, ends up in the bottle of one of the soft drinks shipped to the United States. When the unfortunate victim drinks from the contaminated bottle he is rushed to hospital and General Ross is alerted to Banner's whereabouts. British soldier Blonsky leads the raid of the soft drinks factory and witnessed the Hulk taking out his men though he doesn't realise this is Banner transformed after being overwhelmed by rage and anger. General Ross tells Blonsky the truth that Banner was deceived with the experiment on him, the real purpose being to develop super soldiers. With Blonsky now 39 and no longer the soldier he once was he volunteers to be the next guinea pig in the same experiment, the hope being he is fit, agile and strong enough to face the Hulk.<br /><br />Though Banner escapes back to the United States he has to cross paths with Betty again and the inevitable romance plays out. With the army hot on his trail Banner faces more regular transformations into the Hulk. After hooking up with Betty it is time for Banner to locate Mr Blue and to take steps to curing himself of his purgatorial life. The army has other plans, however, and in Blonsky they have a secret weapon that is initially defeated easily by the Hulk leaving the soldier with nearly every bone in his body shattered. Blonsky, however, is no longer the same as a human and his body quickly repairs itself to fight another day. As with many guinea pigs of scientific experiments, Blonksy comes to face an ordeal even greater than that of the Hulk but this is one of his own choosing as he desires greater strength and power to face his formidable enemy.<br /><br />With such acting talent as Norton and Roth I was optimistic that The Incredible Hulk would be a great film but I was left disappointed by the end. There's nothing wrong with the performances of Norton and Roth, I just felt this film wasn't a worthy vehicle for them to show off their respective talents. Norton, in particular, is one of Hollywood's finest given such a role as Fight Club or American History X but I didn't feel that same memorable performance coming through here. Hurt and Tyler provide okay support while Tim Blake Nelson makes a noteworthy appearance as the mysterious Mr Blue. The film's effects are good but the ending was somewhat unsatisfying with a final showdown between Banner and Blonsky being a little flat. The opening half of the film is better than the second half and although this isn't a bad film it's certainly not the great one I had hoped for.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk is a pretty average action superhero film, getting decent performances out of Norton and Roth, despite the material they have to work with not being spectacular. Though the effects are good they're not stunning and the film feels like everyone is treading too carefully trying to avoid the same mistakes the 2003 Hulk film made. In the end it's an okay effort but not a memorable one.</p></body></html>

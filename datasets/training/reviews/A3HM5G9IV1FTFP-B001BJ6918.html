<meta name="summary" content="Perfect Yin to Volume 1's Yang"></head><body><p>"Kill Bill volume 1" was a thrilling, intense, stylized, gory bloodbath with occasional poignant moments of character development and backstory. We saw the Bride in full-on revenge mode, hacking to pieces anyone who got in the way of her killing the assassins that turned her wedding rehearsal into a massacre. What we have with "Kill Bill volume 2" is actually a perfect yin to volume 1's yang: A poignant, character-driven, dialogue-heavy story with occasional moments of intense, stylized violence. In Volume 2, the focus is on the Bride's complex relationship with Bill, who was her mentor, lover, father figure and would-be killer. We come to understand the reasons why the Bride left the DiVAS to marry a record store owner, and what drove Bill to murder his former lover and protege. As with the last film, Uma Thurman handles every scene and scenario with incredible skill, poise and understated brilliance. David Carradine also gives a terrific performance as the charismatically evil Bill. Props to Tarantino for not just splitting one film in two, but actually creating two distinctly different films that complement and complete each other.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fantastic movie that is as much about ballet as "The Wrestler" was about wrestling. Very dark, disturbing and great. I say A"></head><body><p>How far would you go to be perfect?  After her lifelong dream of being the lead in a ballet, Nina (Portman) finally gets her chance.  Pushing herself as hard as she can, she becomes so absorbed in the role it changes her life.  This is a difficult movie to review without giving too much away.  I can say that this is not your typical ballet movie.  This is the same director of "Requiem For A Dream" and that should tell you what type of film this is.  I would call this a borderline horror movie, and there are equal parts sex and blood as there is dancing.  Lily (Kunis) plays the Yin to Nina's Yang and the movie is better because of the two sides coming together.  The director did the near impossible with this movie, a ballet movie that guys will really enjoy.  I honestly can't say enough good things about this movie, or the the performances.  Portman deservedly won the oscar, and the fact that Kunis was snubbed in a big injustice.  If you don't want to watch this because of the ballet, keep in mind that it is only a part of the movie.  It is more of a trippy thriller than anything, a very good and well done movie.  You will not be dissapointed.  I give it an A.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Yes, I would.  This is a movie that you will be able to catch different things each time you watch.</p></body></html>

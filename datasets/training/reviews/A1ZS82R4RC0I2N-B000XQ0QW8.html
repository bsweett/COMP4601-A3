<meta name="summary" content="Uneven But Unique"></head><body><p>After the overrated yet average &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, Shyamalan presented another intriguing and different piece of cinema with this peculiar movie that gives a new perspective into superheroes` conventions. Bruce Willis returns for the role of the quiet, laid-back lead and shares the screen with Samuel L. Jackson`s enigmatic presence. Like the &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; also tells a mysterious slow paced story where and adult man has deep connections with a kid, but this time the plot is more interesting and original. The direction is terrific and certainly helps to create an absorbing and gripping mood and atmosphere, even if some scenes are too slow and unengaging. The score is adequate as well, as is the convincing and subtle acting. However, some energy wouldn`t hurt this movie, since it has few dynamic scenes given the overall slow rythm. And the ending is a bit anti-climatic and disappointing too, even if it provides a strange surprise. Still, for the most part &quot;Unbreakable&quot; works pretty well and suceeds as a very well-crafted and unusual story worth discovering. It`s also refreshing to watch a superhero that`s so distant from most of the cliches that are common within the genre.<p>Not a classic, just a good effort.</p></body></html>

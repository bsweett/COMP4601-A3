<meta name="summary" content="Great to see these films again after all these years"></head><body><p>The DVD is an ideal medium for box sets of this type.  The films look great, sound great, and there's the nice bonus features to keep the fans of the film entertained for many additional hours.  There are two commentaries per DVD, and luckily the participants in the commentaries (Zemeckis, Gale, et al.) are interesting and have some good stories/insights.  There are also a number of little documentaries, on a variety of topics.<p>Clearly, the first Back to the Future is the jewel of the series - fun, fresh (at the time), with outstanding performances that catch just the right spirit.  Both Michael J. Fox (as Marty McFly) and Christopher Lloyd (as Doc Brown) get right into their characters and we have fun because they are having fun.  The time travel is pretty simplistic and follows the one timeline rule - if you change something in the past, the future you know will be altered by it (see the Terminator films, Star Trek, etc.).  However, the filmakers wisely avoid explaining time travel in detail, which is a smart move because it isn't really a science fiction film, but a comedy.<p>Back to the Future II is much more a polished exercise in filmaking, and it feels somewhat like a technical exercise.  Because the timeline winds back and forth between 4 time periods (including two different versions of the year 1985), it certainly benefits from a second or third viewing.  Watch it to admire the technical skill, and the deft juggling of the time travel - Marty gets to watch himself play at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, for example - and try to avoid the cynical thought that the filmakers are just trying to repackage the 1st film to make more money.<p>I was very disappointed in the third film when I saw it in the theatres, but it's growing on me since then.  It is still the weakest of the three - it's a little thin on plot and the dialogue is definitely below the standard of the first two.  However, it comes together with a fitting if artificially cheerful conclusion at the end.</p></body></html>

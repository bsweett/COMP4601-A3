<meta name="summary" content=""Alice In Wonderland" is great!"></head><body><p>"Alice In Wonderland" is great! This is how the story goes: 19-year-old Alice returns to the whimsical world she first encountered as a young girl, reuniting with her childhood friends: the White Rabbit, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Dormouse, the Caterpillar, the Cheshire Cat, and of course, the Mad Hatter. Alice embarks on a fantastical journey to find her true destiny and end the Red Queen's reign of terror.<br /><br />The cast led by Johnny Depp (in his 7th collaboration with Tim Burton) (as The Mad Hatter), Anne Hathaway (as The White Queen), Helena Bonham Carter (as The Red Queen) (in her 6th collaboration with Tim Burton) & Mia Wasikowska (as Alice) is great! The directing by Tim Burton (also produced) (who has worked with Depp on "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street" (2007, also starring Carter), "Corpse Bride" (also produced) (2005, also starring Carter), "Charlie And The Chocolate Factory" (2005, also starring Carter), "Sleepy Hollow" (1999), "Ed Wood" (1994, also produced), "Edward Scissorhands" (1990, also produced and wrote the story), has worked with Carter on "Big Fish" (2003) & "Planet Of The Apes" (2001) is great! The screenplay (based on Lewis Carroll's books) by Linda Woolverton (also co-produced) (who also did the screenplay to "The Lion King" (1994) is great!<br /><br />The music by Danny Elfman (who also did the music, recently to "The Wolfman" (2010), he has been doing the music to Burton's films since "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure" (1985) is great! The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski (who also did the cinematography to all 3 of the Pirates Of The Caribbean films including the new 4th film, "On Stranger Tides" (2011), he also did the cinematography to "Eagle Eye" (2008), "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street", & the upcoming "The Rum Diary" (2010, also starring Depp) is great! The film editing by Chris Lebenzon (also executive produced) (who also did the film editing to Burton's films since "Batman Returns" (1992) is great! The casting by Susie Figgis (who also did the casting to "Sleepy Hollow", "Charlie And The Chocolate Factory" & "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street", she also did the casting to the upcoming "Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time" (2010) is great! The Oscar-winning production design by Robert Stromberg (who also did the production design to "Avatar" (2009, for which he is nominated for an Oscar) is great! The art direction by Tim Browning (who was an assistant art director on "The Wolfman"), Todd Cherniawsky (who also did the art direction to "Avatar" & the upcoming "Sucker Punch" (2011), Stefan Dechant (supervising art director) (who also did the art direction to "Avatar", "What Lies Beneath" (2000), "Cast Away" (2000), "Jarhead" (2005) & "Lady In The Water" (2006), Andrew L. Jones (who also did the art direction to "Avatar", the upcoming "Green Lantern" (2011) & "The Adventures Of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn" (2011), Mike Stassi (who also did the art direction to "A Christmas Carol" (2009) & was an assistant art director on "Avatar") & Christina Ann Wilson (was an assistant art director on "Big Fish" & did the art direction to "Shutter Island" (2010) is great! The set decoration by Karen O'Hara (who also did the set decoration to "A Christmas Carol") & Peter Young (who also did the set decoration to "Batman" (1989), "Sleepy Hollow", & "Charlie And The Chocolate Factory") is great! The Oscar-winning costume design by Colleen Atwood (who also did the costume design to Burton's films since "Edward Scissorhands") is great!<br /><br />This is a great film, visually beautiful. This is another well-done film from Tim Burton, which this seemly enough, fits him. This is another hit for Depp & Burton.</p></body></html>

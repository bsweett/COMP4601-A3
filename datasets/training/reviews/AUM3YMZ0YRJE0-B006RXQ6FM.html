Though it takes place in 1964, the 60s upheavals are really only beginning.  Streep wants to keep things simple and controlled, Hoffman to open the church to new ideas.  While Streep is more overtly political in the way she enlists a young nun, the wonderful Amy Adams, Hoffman is also proven extremely adept at these kinds of career maneuvering.<br /><br />The pawn in the story is a solitary young black boy, the first admitted to the Bronx catholic school.  He is deeply troubled from an abusive household, yet full of potential; his mother is on his side and hoping to advance his education with the desperation of a person who know she has only one shot.  As we all know from recent allegations, the church did not deal well with the proclivities of some of its employees.  As Hoffman has lavished attention on the black boy, he becomes suspect in this regard.  The young nun is caught in between.<br /><br />Now, on the surface, it is easy to label the characters.  Streep is vicious, resentful, and seeking power as she looks back; Hoffman is a good man, a victim, a visionary who looks forward.  But of course, things may not be that simple.  Streep may be onto something.  Hoffman may not be all that he appears.  To the great credit of the playwrite, this is never definitively resolved, but left to the viewer to reason it out.  The result is an utterly rivetting drama that can be interpreted in many different ways.  I think that there is truth to everyone's point of view in the film.<br /><br />Recommended.  The film is a window into a world, a time, and a terrible human dilemma.  The acting is absolutely first rate.</p></body></html>

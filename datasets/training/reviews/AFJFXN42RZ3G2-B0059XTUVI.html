"Iron Lady" is a moving picture of England's most influential and at times controversial leaders Margaret Thatcher who fittingly inherits the name of being an "iron lady" with a domineering female presence amidst an environment of male counterparts.  The film depicts her rise as a young politician that weaves within a collage of memories of her personal and professional life.<br /><br />The movie is somewhat of a love play of Thatcher's career but most of all her love for her husband Denis Thatcher (Jim Broadbent) and family, especially her daughter Carole (Olivia Colman) and though not shown within the film except in flashbacks her absent son Matthew.  During the opening scenes of the film, one must orient one's self with what exactly is happening in the kitchen between Thatcher and her husband.  This is a moment in Thatcher's life as well as one of the focal points of the storyline of the film depicting her twilight years.  Director Phylla Lord and Writer Abi Morgan do a good job interplaying the film's storylines of the life of Margaret Thatcher.  There are moments in the film that may take time to understand amidst the history that most know of Thatcher during the Reagan Years and her personal life that only now, unless one has followed every point of her life, the film sheds a light upon.  While watching the film, viewers may think of other biopics that take an extremely intimate approach towards showing the humanistic aspects of almost larger than life figures.  There are qualities of the film that bears similarities to the film "Iris" or "The King's Speech," each depicting notable figures in English history.<br /><br />But what one may come out of watching the film despite parallels with other biopics, it is an interesting movie that takes an unpredictable approach to delving into the life of a woman that made an enormous impact to the world during the most tumultuous times in twentieth century history.  This film is much recommended for the history aficionado or anyone who has the curiosity to understand influential people that have made a difference.</p></body></html>

It is greater than I recall it to be!<br /><br />IMHO this is director Milos Forman's best movie, better than his other two excellent opuses: "Amadeus" (1984) and "Rag Time" (1981).<br /><br />The outstanding strength of this drama is based on a strange confrontation. In one side stands the Rightful Nurse and in the other The Crook; she applies the Law to attain unlawful goals and exercise power; he evades the Law to attain justice and welfare for his impaired mates.<br />Both characters meet head-on with devastating results for them and the people surrounding them. The issue that shocks me most is to realize how an outsider may be able to asses which are the needs of internees where professionals fail.<br /><br />There are three major high points in this film: playacting, script and direction.<br />Jack Nicholson as The Crook delivers one of his best performances in a career that has many high quality characterizations. He is able to convey to the viewers the complex and contradictory personality of McMurphy and win the Oscar to Best Actor in Leading Role.<br />Louise Fletcher performs at the same height as Nicholson with more sober acting resources and also deservedly won the Oscar. Actually she never again reached that level of excellence.<br />In secondary roles Danny de Vito, Vincent Schiavelli, Will Sampson and specially Brad Dourif (Oscar nominee) are paramount.<br /><br />The script due to Bo Goldman & Lawrence Hauben makes the most of every scene and gives no respite.<br /><br />Finally Milos Forman's direction is impeccable extracting the best from each actress & actor and delivers an unforgettable film that will be remembered as one of the best of the '70s.<br /><br />This is a great movie for adult audience and deserves to be in any movie fan collection!<br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

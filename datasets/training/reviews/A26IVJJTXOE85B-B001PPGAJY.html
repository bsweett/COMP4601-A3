GET A LIFE!<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING<br /><br />The sequel to the beautifully character driven original, "X-Men" has more action, a longer running time, and a larger cast this time around. For many people these attributes constitute credentials for a "better" film but in my opinion "X2" SLIGHTLY falters in the story telling department when compared to the first film simply because the film abandons several character's development; characters who were developed and introduced in the first film, only to be pushed to the side in favor for the Wolverine character. Before I begin my analysis I'd like to state that I am the hugest X-Men fan in my area. I meet a lot of people who say they love X-Men but when I actually converse with them I found out that they are merely fans of the cartoon and actually know very little about X-Men at all.<br /><br />With that being said, i thought the opening scene to the film was great and there is no denying that the film's greatest highlight is the inclusion of the character Nightcrawler, who is played impeccably by Alan Cumming and whose action scenes are crafted beautifully by the special effects department. The main plot of the film is an intriguing one, based on the X-Men graphic novel, "God Loves, Man Kills."  Bryan Singer made some changes to the storyline, which is a SLIGHT  shame because the original story would have complimented the religious character Nightcrawler greatly. The original story  had such a deep meaning, using a lot of religious symbolism, which lead to the drawing of comparisons to mutants as angels or demons in a society that was swarming with fear of the new mutant phenomenon. All this was changed in order to tell Wolverine's story, so essentially this film is combining two stories and putting them into one, which in its own right is pretty well done. The other story is the Weapon X saga and what Brian Singer has done is taken William Stryker, the villain from "God Loves, Man Kills" and made him the architect of Wolverine's unbreakable skeleton. Willian Stryker, who is played impeccably by Brian Cox, is the other strong point of this film. He plays his role with great conviction and the best scene in the film is when he finally reveals his malicious plot to Professor X. It also must be noted that the cinematography is beautiful as well as Singer's directing...but his writing is an entirely different matter which i will touch on later.<br /><br />Another excellent scene that must be noted is when Magneto, played exceptionally once again by Ian McKellen, rips the blood iron out of police guard's body. The inclusion of this scene is almost worth forgiving all the other inconsistancies in this film.  ALMOST.<br /><br />There are several characters in this film who feel left out and feel like they stand around and don't contribute much to the story, namely the characters Cyclops Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro. Cyclops' role feels cast aside in favor for Wolverine and it sticks out like a sore thumb. He is simply missing for a good hour and fifteen minutes with little explaination as to where he went. The lack of urgency into his wherababouts is nowhere to be seen, especially in his true love Jean Grey, which for me is an example of poor storytelling. Jean flirts with Wolverine too carefree and mentions she is worried about her lover but it cannot be seen on the surface at all. I understand that it's okay not to have Cyclops at the center of the film, as he wasn't even part of the X-Men team for most of the 80's, but to introduce a character in the first film and to simply push him aside with little explanation of his whereabouts is what I consider poor storytelling. If you want to take him out of the highlight, do it right, and for me this was only a hint of what was to come in an even worst handling of the character in the next film, X3.<br /><br />All the scenes with Iceman, Rogue, and Pyro feel misplaced, like a channel was changed to Disney Channel or Teen Nickelodeon. Clearly Singer doesn't read the comics or novels because his interpretation of these characters is so far off that it makes me cringe. During this film's down times the dialogue is not at its best. References to boyfriends, girlfriends and babysitting, it feels misplaced in a sci-fi environment, especially X-Men.<br /><br />The lack of character development for Rogue's character is disappointing as well. Her character in the first film, while changed to a young girl with no super powers and more in an innocent phase in her life, was still appreciated because she was a vital role to the main plot and I felt her introduction would lead to the eventuality of her becoming the Rogue we all know and love; strong spirited and fighting in a deep struggle to control her powers. There is nothing like that here. She is simply Iceman's girlfriend and all hope of her becoming the Rogue that we all know and love is abandoned. The thing I abhor the most about this film is the relationship that Brian Singer created for her, which is with the Iceman character. This is so far off from the comic that I cannot turn a blind eye to it. It feels blasphemous, putting her in a relationship with the Iceman character. In the comic book there is a beautiful story that is told, where she is in a relationship with a character named Gambit, a playboy type character. She struggles in finding trust for him and he struggles in trying to prove his love for her, knowing he can have any woman he wants, he chooses the woman he can't touch. It is a very touching story and better executed than the sappy love story Singer has created. What also must be noted is they way Singer conceptualizes Rogues reactions to Iceman's advances. When Iceman makes a pass at her she is hardly resistant at all, while in the books, THE REAL ROGUE would punch you in your face if you tried to make an advance at her because she is greatly traumatized by her childhood experience with touching another person, which was executed beautifully in the first film. In X2, she simply says, "I don't want to hurt you....Oh well, let's give it a try." That's not Rogue's character at all!!! She is suppose to struggle with her powers and push people away from her in fear that she'll kill them!! Okay, so Singer didn't give Rogue superpowers, that's fine, but to completely change her personality is a crime and a great injustice to such a great character that is beloved by X-Men fans. The love story Brian Singer has come up with is flat, boring, typical, and I know the scene where Rogue and Iceman are holding hands while contemplating the possibility of death is suppose to symbolize similar prospects of the Gambit-Rogue love affair but its execution feels so downgraded and meaningless that it is almost laughable.<br /><br />Here's an excerpt from a REAL romance from X-Men 24 between Rogue and Gambit. This is what was butchered and watered down by Brian Singer. This is one of the greatest romances ever and the main reason why i cannot turn a blind eye to Singer's butchering of this great love story. remember, Rogue cannot touch anyone, yet Gambit, a man who could have ANY woman, chose the one he can't touch...<br /><br />Gambit strokes Rogue's hair and tries to put his cheek to Rogue.<br /><br />Rogue: "No! I can't...Because I know if I hurt you...I know...I'll just want to die!"<br /><br />Tears come to Rogues eyes. Gambit holds her.<br /><br />Gambit: "Then we won't kiss Rogue. Simple as that...Maybe that's just fine now for you and me. Maybe we both have to learn that there is more to love than just the physical. I know what's inside you, chere....Maybe we'll both end up learning what love really means and I can't think of anyone else to learn with than you, Rogue...That's all that matters."<br /><br />WHAT BRIAN SINGER AND HIS WRITERS HAVE DONE IS A DISGRACE TO THE ROGUE CHARACTER!!! What do we get instead of this deep and epic romance? we get a horny iceman who can't take no for an answer, who doesn't consider how Rogue feels, he just wants to make-out. And a Rogue who kisses iceman for 2 seconds and when her power does take effect, it barely does nothing. The consequences of her using her power is completely undermined! When she touches someone, she absorbs their memories and it's a big deal. Here it's nothing but a walk in the park, especially the scene where she "controls" Pyro. I still can't believe this gets by all these X-Men "fans."<br /><br />The Iceman character's personality is another thing that was compromised by Brian Singer. His whole personality has been changed into that of a total wannabe Justin Bieber teenage heart throb, while in the comic he was a humorous and confident smart ass. The Iceman character would have been a great oppurtunity to use some very witty and intelligent dialogue, it's a shame.<br /><br />Another scene that was pointless was the camping scene, or at least a good ?'s of it. The reason why Magneto just so happens to be standing in that particular geographic location while the Blackbird is crashing is never explained, or better yet you can't explain it, it's simply ridiculous that he would be coincidentally there. The scene where Mystique tries to seduce Wolverine is pointless. I would have much rather have utilized that time frame to see where Cyclops was and it feels like Brian Singer lost all objectivity in telling an X-Men story, a story that is an assemble piece, in exchange for the popular-at-the-moment-character Wolverine. I felt it was unwise to introduce Cyclops and Rogue in the first film and completely abandon their development.<br /><br />It was good to see Storm get a little more to do this time around, namely having a friendship with Nightcrawler, who helps her regain her faith. I also enjoyed the handling of the Weapon X saga...it was really well done. i love the scene where wolverine breaks out of the facility and has blood all over his hands screaming in agony!! That 10 second clip was better than the entire x-men origins movie!!<br /><br />I also enjoyed the special effects, namely Storm's tornado's and the epic fight scene between wolverine and deathstrike. And finally we get to see wolverine cut loose, tearing enemies to shreds who invade the x-mansion!<br /><br />despite this films flaws, the goods outweigh the bads...</p></body></html>

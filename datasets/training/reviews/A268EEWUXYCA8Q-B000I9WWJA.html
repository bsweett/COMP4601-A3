The movie keeps throwing "ending" after "ending" at you until you're just ready for it to be over with.  Inside Man is one of these movies.<br /><br />There are some good even great things going on in Inside Man.  As a character and genre study, its amazing.  Screenwriter Russell Gewirtz has fun with the heist film cliches, by creating a situation that's unknown to the viewers until close to the end, and then building a heist film around it.  There is a motive here, hidden and entirely secret that stretches beyond a mere bank robbery much like this film is more than about a heist.  Half of the film's fun comes from confusion and trying to ascertain why the heist is happening, what's going through Clive Owen's Dalton Russell's head.<br /><br />As a character study, it's also interesting.  Not one of the main characters has morals.  Each character has a motive, a desire and not one of them is pristine.  Its nice after seeing her in two women in distress films, that Jodi Foster can bring the cold-hearted and calculated feelings to her character.  The characters are morally ambivalent and, while it can be considered a jaded view of society, but it was interesting seeing conflicted characters who might not be interested in what's right or wrong, but what's good for them.  It might be jaded, but it also is in some ways a good representation of how some things work.<br /><br />Of course there were some indications that this is a Spike Lee film.  Some of his critiques on society are spot on and humorous.  I did take offense with the very minor, but definitely frustrating poke at video games.  Very minor in the film and has nothing to do with it that I hate to bring it up.  But the implication that even these morally ambivalent characters have a problem with a video game (not even an actual game, by the way) was frustrating to me.  Others seemed timely, but stretched.  As an example, the Arab who's really a Sheik and the police saying something to the effect "Oh my God he's Arab!" seemed strained.  Timely, interesting, yes, but seemed stilted.<br /><br />Spike Lee also does a great job of introducing minor characters that really help to flesh out the story and provide a backdrop for what's happening.  For instance, the cop who comes on the scene in the beginning and his story of when he first had a gun shoved in his face is interesting.  Needless, maybe, but interesting.  Its just unfortunate that at times, Lee seems more interested in pursuing these little details instead of keeping the film moving.<br /><br />At any rate, its an interesting film that gets bogged down toward the end.  Pacing issues aside, it is a good film that turns some heist conventions on its head while presenting jaded characters who each have a motive and who are very human and real.  It would have been better, though, with a litter tighter script that didn't have to explain every little thing at the end.</p></body></html>

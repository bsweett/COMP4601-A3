<meta name="summary" content="What a great easy going movie for the whole family ...."></head><body><p>I didn't see this movie when it hit the theaters but have always been surprised that my friends who are proabably the most 'jaded' of critics all seemed to like the film. Not in the sense that it is a MUST SEE FILM but rather that it's a very enjoyable 'escape from reality' ....<br /><br />OK so if its a menatl escape movie you really have to allow the writers some creative leeway that set up the story of a down and out rocker, Jack Balke, managing to get a substitute teacher position at a very very up-tight prep school run by the principal Joan Cusak. Both of them certainly carry the movie and make their roles believable. Similarily the director manages to maintain the prep school 'geek' persona of the students who form the band right until the very end when the 'school' band manages to make it to a battle of the bands rock concert ....<br /><br />Rather than being a laughing out loud type of comedy this is certainly a great great enjoyable feel good film ....</p></body></html>

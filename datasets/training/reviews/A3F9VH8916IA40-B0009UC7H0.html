There are really only two things I have to tell you about to prove this movie stupid, I don't even have to talk about the awful acting or the crazy nonsense plot. one, they shoot down a helicopter with a Civil War cannon that's been buried under the sand in the SAHARA desert for 150 years, and an armored column surrenders to cavalry.<br /><br />Here's why that's so insanely stupid for all those who don't get it, and I'm going to use historical examples to prove it. During the battle of Gettysburg the army of Northern Virginia opened fire on the union army with their long ranged cannon, and MISSED! They couldn't even hit an army. now, fast forward to the modern day, give a cannon that's been buried under the sand since the end of the war to three Indiana Jones want to be's and give them the most impossible target to hit, a helicopter. What do you think happens? Well, they shoot it down, duh.<br /><br />Second, an entire armored column, I think there must have been more then a dozen tanks, surrenders to an enemy army on horse back. Now, does anyone remember when the Polish army fought German tanks during WWII? Anyone? Well I'll tell you, uh, they died. Yeah, they all got killed because there is no possible way for mounted cavalry to defeat armor, and yet the tankers in this movie didn't seem to know that. Pathetic.<br /><br />There's a lot more I could rant about, like how on earth could a Civil War battleship get to the Sahara desert, but I think I've made my point. This movie is simply one of the dumbest ever made, and I've seen some doozies. Stay away, for the love of god, stay away from this flick and just see Indiana Jones.<br /><br />Replay value; Very low.</p></body></html>

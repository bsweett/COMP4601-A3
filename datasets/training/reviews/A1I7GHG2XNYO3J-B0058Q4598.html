Was it war, famine or the dreaded global warming? I was enjoying the film until the propaganda began (first 20 min. or so was cool). I was truly expecting Al Gore to be the scientist that helped the alien decide how to show mankind his power. Once again hollywood shows not only how it is incapable at creation but can also destroy a classic with its frail attempt at remakes.</p></body></html>

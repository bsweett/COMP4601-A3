He really didn't go the safe route with this one, which would have been an easy play due to it's comic book subject matter.  You could have done a PG-13 with this one.  Nosiree, Bob!  Verhoeven likes to spit in the face of Hollywood and makes flicks down and dirty, the way he likes.  It's interesting to go back and watch this film after not seeing it for a long time.  Talk about violent!  Hard to believe they made a cartoon, tv series and action figure line based on this.  This isn't really for kids if you ask me.  The Criterion version restores violence trimmed by our pals at the MPAA in case the R version wasn't violent enough for you already.  The cut scenes consist of bits in the first hal hour of the movie.  It all probably adds up to 40 seconds total, but those 40 or so seconds add a new dimension to the scene though it doesn't really  add depth to the story at all.  I'll tell you what you're missing so you can ponder it before you invest in this edition.  1)  The scene where ED-209 is introduced to the board, malfunctions and kills a guy.  Remember that?  It's basically the same except there's a few more seconds of ED blasting that poor schmuck after he has fallen down(and obviously dead).  Gruesome!  Fun!  The other cut material is Murphy's death scene.  When Clarence blasts his hand off with the shotgun(&quot;Give the man a hand!&quot;), you actually see Murphy holding the bloody stump.  Icky!  Fun!  Remember after that, all three gang members shoot him a million times while he shakes and yells?  Well, the very first shot completely takes his arm off.  That would explain how his arm magically disappeared in the R version.  Then, they stop shooting him for a moment and let Murphy sit there and scream in pain as one of the gang says in amusement:  &quot;Hey, Clarence!  He's still alive!&quot;  A few more bloody snippets follow of Murphy's murder, but that's pretty much it for the censored stuff.  Either way this is a great movie.  Even with the corny name and concept, this manages to be an emotional, thought provoking, satirical, well written, well directed movie.  Watch it again, you'll be pleasantly surprised.</p></body></html>

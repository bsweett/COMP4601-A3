Most of the humor is site gags, but there are some decent jokes as well. Although I enjoyed the movie, it seemed like it was missing something. I prefer him in "Night at the Roxbury". It was an excellent story and very funny. I'm just not sure about buying "Taledega Nights". This seems a little strained at times during some of the sight gags. You certainly will chuckle, but it may not tickle your funny bone as deep as some of his other works. I recommend renting it first before buying it. It may be funnier to you NASCAR fans since you know the sport far better than I do.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Unexpected Event"></head><body><p>And an unexpected feel-good film.  Juno is not your typical teenage pregnancy story.  It is, instead, a realistic, yet surprisingly entertaining look at an extremely difficult year in the life of a young pregnant girl.  With a loving and caring family, good friends, and the baby's father, Juno attempts to take back control of her life and her circumstances, and to make life altering decisions in her own unique and quirky way.<br /><br />Ellen Page is a phenomenal young actress who plays the title role of June with realism, warmth, intelligence and a wisecracking wit.  Juno wants to do what is best for her baby, for her family, for her friends, and for herself.  Ellen Page expertly runs the gamut of Juno's emotions and hormones, slowly drawing us in and making us a part of this girl's life and her predicament.  We laugh, we cry, we hope, we care.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is equally talented and up to the challenge.  Michael Cera as the child's father and Juno's best friend, J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's shocked but supportive parents, and Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner as the desperate, prospective adoptive parents all give excellent, believable performances.<br /><br />Juno sneaks up on you.  It is a quiet film that subtly gets under your skin.  I highly recommend this film for a sweet, touching evening at home.</p></body></html>

I really don't seem to follow some of those older westerns. The ones where 2 people duel over the revenge of someone. Anyways, this movie is entertaining and pretty well done.<p>Clint Eastwood is pretty cool. At the beginning he doesn't get to do much, but later he gets to shoot some guys. Gene Hackman isn't too bad of a guy, and he does a great job of being vengeful yet calm. Morgan Freeman does a great job of backing Clint up, but Clint Eastwood is still the star. Also, English Bob was a great character, but he was mostly there to show you what Gene Hackman(Dagget) is really like.<p>As for the movie itself? You can look up the synopsis anywhere, but the movie is great. It keeps you there with great visuals and great acting/characters.</p></body></html>

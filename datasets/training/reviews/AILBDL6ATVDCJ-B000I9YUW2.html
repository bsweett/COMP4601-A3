It was a little like being on a roller-coaster ride where ya can't see the next turn or twist.  I thought the story moved along well, the acting was convincing, and the dialogue fit the happenings in a decent manner.<br /><br />I think the less a person knows about this film before viewing it, the more they will enjoy it.<br /><br />There is action, suspense, drama, and a little bit of (well, sort of) romance (maybe kindness is a better word).<br /><br />I recommend this film, and since I am such an awesome movie reviewer, you should listen to me and buy it.  Ignore the bad reviews; they don't know what they are talking about.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></body></html>

Either this flick was a cheap imitation of the slasher films of the Seventies, or it substituted blood and gore for a plot, or it wasn't &quot;cool&quot; enough with its gore (whatever that means), yada yada yada.  <p>Horse feathers.  The horror genre really isn't my cup of tea (make that cherry Kool-Aid), but I could darn sure tell that Rob Zombie (bet that's his real name) decided his HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES was going to do everything but take its grimy, gory self seriously.  This movie slices and dices while rehashing and recycling the same old tired plot about four kids in the wrong place at the wrong time, yet the extra zaniness and insanity keeps the story from growing as stale as the loaf of bread on my kitchen counter.  Zombie, even though he's paying bloody homage to the classic slashers of the past, travels down several unique roads that inherently enhance the film's entertainment value and cult status.  Again, all the macabre, loony enhancements aren't my cup of Kool-Aid, but it's obvious the cast and crew were having fun, and it shows via each frame.<p>The confrontation of good vs. evil drives the motor of each horror story, and that's what is lacking in HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES.  Pure evil dominates, from start to finish, ultimately creating a sense of disinterest on the part of the viewer.  Even Freddy Kruger would get kicked around every once in awhile, but not these ghouls.  On the other hand, Karen Black can kick me all she wants to.  Even though the years are adding up on old Karen, she still brings out the &quot;zombie&quot; in me.  In fact, I'm feeling kind of petrified right now.<br />--D. Mikels</p></body></html>

The first Hostel left me wondering about this business, how it really works, what kinds of people would pay for this. The sequel shows us the behind the scenes working, from the moment the girls check in, until the newest member is branded. I personaly like all of the girls, except Axelle, obviously. I liked adventuros Whitney, sweet but depressed Lorna, and rich but not at all snobbish, Beth. The movie did make me wonder if Beth was a lesbian, but the fact that it wasn't answered was okay. I did think the kids playing ball at the end was a little too much, but it did make me laugh. If Hostel 3 is released, I'll see it!</p></body></html>

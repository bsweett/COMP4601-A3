<meta name="summary" content="WHY ?"></head><body><p>The release of this movie was delayed several times but it does not take a rocket scientist to realize why it finally came out exactly the week AFTER the Razzies nominations. At any rate, Steve Martin has to, MUST be considered among next year's nominees. I don't know if there is an actor today who can take over Peter Sellers' role but one thing is clear, Steve Martin is not it. In baseball terms he "goes for the fences" but an infield hit is (seldom) as far as he ever gets. I just felt sorry for him throughout the movie (as well as for the few people who did manage to laugh during the showing I went to) and sincerely wish they paid him well to do it.<br /><br />The good news is for "Bewitched" which is off the hook as the worst recent remake.</p></body></html>

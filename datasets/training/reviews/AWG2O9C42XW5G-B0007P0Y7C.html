<meta name="summary" content="An Excellent Movie"></head><body><p>Man, Jennifer garner comes back to us In "Elektra," this bad ass chick has another chance at life to do what she wants and she does. When we last saw Elektra she was dying In "DareDevil" which i may add was an awesome movie. But this time she'll have to do without Daredevil's help. This time she comes back to life by a man named Stick who brought her back. Now Elktra has to find out the true meanning of life. She here just to kill or to save lifes and become a heroine. While she is finding this out she helps a man and his little girl from getting killed by a dangerous clan called The Hand. can she do it. i bet she can. jennifer garner's peromance is excellent and she is hot in that red outfit. Guys you are in for a suprise. I think the filmmakers picked a good person to portray Elektra. I recomend this movie for everyone.<br /><br />If you liked this movie check out, the soundtrack, The score and the Novel from the film.</p></body></html>

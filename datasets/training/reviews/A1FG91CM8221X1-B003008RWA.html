<meta name="summary" content="A great advocacy piece, but the cracks are showing."></head><body><p>When we go to a Michael Moore film, we know we aren't going to get reasoned analysis, so there's no sense in complaining about its absence. What we get is impassioned, left-leaning advocacy on behalf of people victimized by the huge, voracious, profit-driven gaps in "the American system." In his best films, such as "Bowling for Columbine" or "Fahrenheit 9/11," Moore can get away with one-sided advocacy because the cold, hard, balanced facts support only his side. The first half of "Sicko" is some of the most compelling filmmaking Moore has ever done, because it details case after heartrending case of flagrant, murderous injustice committed against ordinary American citizens by the hideous bureaucracy of the American health care system. We hear of the little girl who died because Kaiser Permanente didn't authorize care at the hospital where her mother took her; of the desperately ill, disoriented people literally dumped at homeless shelters, still in their hospital gowns, because their insurance ran out; of the 9/11 rescue workers who can't get health care after sacrificing their health in the effort to save their countrymen's lives. We see former insurance company workers break down weeping because they were forced to turn down claims they knew were valid, all in the name of maximizing profits. As one of them says, "These people didn't fall through the cracks. They were swept toward the cracks and forced down them." This is advocacy journalism at its best. Moore, unfortunately, is far less effective in the film's second half, when he extols--strictly on anecdotal evidence--the vast superiority of the British, French, Canadian and Cuban health care systems. While there's no question these systems have saved millions of people from going bankrupt over health care costs, Moore loses a lot of points by not pointing out the problems with these systems. Britain's system, for example, is a two-tiered system in which those who can afford it can go straight to Harley Street and bypass the waiting line at the National Health Service (which, despite Moore's claims otherwise, can be lethally long). And also, after pointing out that the U.S. ranks #37 in the world in health care and extolling the marvelous health care system of Cuba, he fails to note that the list he himself presents shows Cuba at #39. Moore's final stunt, taking a group of sick people first to Guantanamo, then to Havana, for health care feels cheesy and staged in the extreme. Moore has been accused in the past of taking advantage of his interview subjects, but here it's blatant; Moore is using these frightened, desperately ill people to make a Big Point Against the System. He caps the movie with an act of charity that I will not reveal, but which I think most people will agree is less an act of charity than of self-aggrandizing revenge. He'll get no points in Heaven for it, I can assure you. The insane, crippling costs of health care in this country, and the Byzantine, callous health insurance bureaucracy, are national scandals that must be reformed, and Moore brings its injustices home to us with justified outrage. But if there's one area in public debate that screams for thought and reason, it's health care. That Michael Moore couldn't be expected to give us that doesn't mean that he didn't have to.</p></body></html>

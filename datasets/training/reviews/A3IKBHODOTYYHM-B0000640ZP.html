I think this movie was a very worthy effort and quite better than most scary movies they make these days. I like movies that are actually scary, and that's what this movie is (unlike the useless "Scream" or "I know what you did" type genre horror flicks). Yeah, there are similarities to "The Sixth Sense" within the movie, and these perhaps don't make this movie as refreshing as it could have been. Still, that being said, I would rent this video again and watch it because I feel as though it was entertaining and the horror aspect of it was believable and worked. The dreary movie effects and the cast of this movie were successful in creating an uneasy feeling for the viewer, which is what horror movies are all about.</p></body></html>

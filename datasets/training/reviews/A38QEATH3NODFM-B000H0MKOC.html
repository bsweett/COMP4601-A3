A note up front, you have to keep an open mind with this movie. This movie was actually very funny and pointed out a number of thing that I think we all realize but never verbalize.  This is based in the late 90's prior to the tobacco settlement, the main character is a Lobbyist for the tobbacco industry.  It explores his job and his life and why he did the job. Many people write him off as a murderer, but this movie adresses this and more.  Throw in his dinner meetings with his Lobbyist friends from Alcohol and Firearms, I would not have thought i could laugh at the movie, but I did. The movie was well written, great voiceovers where needed, and dialog flowed well.  The movie is best summed up by one of the lines "you have to pay the mortgage".  So if you want a thinking comedy, and don't mind some dark humor on occasion, i think this is worth a viewing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The best Terminator movie! And I've seen the first two, which were great!"></head><body><p>This is the best Terminator movie yet! I thought TX was not only a grand villainess, but she also was beautiful and everything an evil terminator should be. I loved the perfect fights and superb tension this film had, and Arnold's second Terminator hero was even better than the one in Terminator 2-Judgement Day(which I own the extreme DVD of, I should add!)There was more humor in this movie than in the first two, as well. Anyway, nuff said! This movie is a must-see for all who like Terminator or any action thrillers!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DARK, HORRIFYING, SAD & BRILLIANT"></head><body><p>Darren Aronofsky follows his stunning debut film ' with this brilliant, electrified look at addiction.  What will be long remembered, is the stupendous, raw, brilliant, performance of Ellen Burstyn as a lonely, plump, widowed mother hooked on diet pills and TV.  Jared Leto is her son and Jennifer Connelly is his beautiful girlfriend.  Marlon Wayans is Jared's best friend.<br /><br />Based on the acclaimed novel by Hubert Selby, this deeply disturbing film adaptation burns itself into your heart and mind as these four individuals become possessed by something beyond themselves where their dreams become nightmares of dark desire.<br /><br />The disc is a very crisp transfer with a multitude of special features that include two commentary tracks, one by director Aronofsky and another by cinematographer Matthew Libatique.  In addition, Ellen Burstyn interviews author Selby, there's a making-of documentary, deleted scenes with commentary, anatomy of a scene, production notes and more. Highly recommended.

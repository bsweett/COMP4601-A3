<meta name="summary" content="Spacey's Loving Tribute to Meteoric Star..."></head><body><p>Bobby Darin crammed a lot of living into his 37 years, and if he never achieved the pinnacle of stardom he yearned for, he created an unforgettable legacy in an era where, with talent and luck, magic could happen. And Kevin Spacey has captured the magic in this loving film biography!<br /><br />While far too old for the role (his gaunt features scarcely recall the chubby-faced Italian-American crooner), Spacey, as star and director, shares Darin's passion for perfection, and the film has an electricity that many other recent film bios have lacked. Not only does the film offer a flawless musical performance by Spacey (who worked from Darin's original arrangements), it addresses Darin's personal demons (knowledge he would die young, after childhood rheumatic fever; discovering his 'sister' was, in fact, his mother; seeing the musical world completely change around him; an increasing dependency on drugs) without falling into clich&eacute;s or relying on modern-day editorializing. Darin embraced life, and this joy makes the film a celebration of the man behind the music.<br /><br />The highlight of the film is Darin's remarkable, life-long love with Sandra Dee, portrayed to wide-eyed perfection by Kate Bosworth. Dee, totally controlled by her manipulative mother (Greta Scacchi), was as naive as any of her screen heroines, and her pursuit by the amorous pop singer was as funny and wildly romantic as a classic Hollywood musical (a fact not lost on Spacey, who turns the courtship into a terrific singing and dancing production number). Only after their marriage, when Darin's career made him a frequently absentee husband and father, did Dee find increasing solace in a bottle, as her career crumbled...and to both of their credit, Darin and Dee put their careers on hold, to give their son more attention, despite the disastrous effect it had on each of them, professionally.<br /><br />"Beyond the Sea" offers a first-rate supporting cast, including blustery John Goodman, as loyal manager Steve Blauner, Brenda Blethyn, as Darin's gifted mother/grandmother, and Caroline Aaron and Bob Hoskins, as his sister/mother, and her wise, 'blue collar' husband. Deserving special recognition is young William Ullrich, portraying Darin, as a child, who not only offers a sensitive portrayal, but does a very credible song-and-dance number with Spacey!<br /><br />Filmed entirely at Germany's Marlene Dietrich Studios (during the frigid winter of 2003), the film perfectly captures the 'look' of New York, Italy, and Las Vegas, with no indication of the financial difficulties Spacey faced during production (causing shooting to be delayed nearly six months).<br /><br />The final film certainly justifies the hardships; it is on the short list of truly great pop performer biographies, and is a well-deserved triumph for Kevin Spacey!</p></body></html>

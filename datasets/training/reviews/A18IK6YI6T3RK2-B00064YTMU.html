<meta name="summary" content="Cruise Control"></head><body><p>I was skeptical about this movie, I mean Tom Cruise as a grey headed assassin and I thought of Jamie Fox as a comedian, but when I saw  this movie last year I was really taken aback.  The movie is well paced and Cruise is in rare form, Fox does a nice job, but this is Cruise's movie and he is very good, expecially when things start to go wrong, his character is riviting.  My only qualms are the movie is a bit long and I really did not buy Jada Pincket being into Jamie Fox, that really is a stretch, uh in real live or film quite frankly.  Having said that I would still recommend this movie, when it good, it's really good and that's  worth the price of the DVD, plus the extra's are nice.</p></body></html>

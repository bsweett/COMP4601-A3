He has just been kicked out the band that he was playing in so he accepts a job as a subsitute teacher in an exclusive school.There he soon learns that the young boys and girls have a lot of musical talent so he forms a band. Jack has got good taste in music. He likes AC/DC and Black Sabbath and Motorhead and has no time for the junk that passes for music these days.Rap music is not even given a mention. No doubt Jack is of the same belief as me that Rap was invented by some no talent guy who couldn't sing but wanted to be a star anyway. Jack informs his students that the purpose of playing Rock music is "to stick it to the man" which I agree with. Just watching this movie made me want to pick up my 1971 Gibson Les Paul Recording Guitar and try to shatter a few windows. This movie has fine acting, a great cast and a great rocking soundtrack . What more could you ask for?</p></body></html>

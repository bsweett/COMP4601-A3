<meta name="summary" content="Raised my blood pressure: gave me a bloody nose!"></head><body><p>When I first saw this a lot of it went right over my head!<br />I saw the Young Indian Jones about how the Arabs were treated at the treaty meeting in France.<br />The Germans fought the first world war basically because the British and French were backing them into a corner.<br />The British Empire despite all the history we get was just not a real nice<br />way to treat other people?<br />T. E. Lawrence was in this movie a pawn of the British used to get Arab<br />terrorists to attack the Turkish troops. No one can say that the Turks were nice, just they were civilization in the Islamic sense.<br />But oil was a new motive and the middle east was an important part of the future that the British Empire needed.<br />Saying that the fellow Lawrence was used and ultimately abused<br />by the process may well be a simplification.<br />My opinion is that he may have been abused by this movie<br />( after the fact). But the movie also made history<br />and brought a new way to look at historical figures in film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="So who is watching the Watchmen?"></head><body><p>I am very impressed with this movie; 5 of 5 stars. Just watched the extended Director's cut making it a very very long movie. The story is very complex with alot of flash-backs and even some flash-forwards. Several stories are intermixed until they finally all come together. Great characters. Unique style of photography and vision. I just added this to my list of favorites. I will have to see this movie a few times to completely digest and understand it; complex.</p></body></html>

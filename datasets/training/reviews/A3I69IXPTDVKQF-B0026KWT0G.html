I would place it above only "Jason X".  That's not to say I disliked it; I enjoyed it quite a lot, but it doesn't come close to some of the other "Friday's that make my 'best-of' list.  It's probably the least distinguished and least distinct of its series, but it succeeds in spite of itself.  There are some interesting ideas (that could have been fleshed out more), but also some seeming contradictions in the time scale.  There are some likable characters (though not to the level of "Part 2"'s overall cast) and some less likable ones.  The girls are very pretty.<br /><br />  In the last 20 minutes or so, the quality of the film picks up sharply.  Prevoiusly a good watch, it suddenly starts to attain the superior feel and spirit of its two predecessors, almost but not quite making it to their level, albeit a little late.<br /><br />  Obviously much of the appeal of the original theatrical release was its 3-D nature, but unfortunately it is not available over here in that format, despite the capacity of DVD to support it, nor does it look like it'll get a domestic release in 3D anytime soon.  In that case I wish they'd re-release it theatrically, because even though its not one of the best Fridays, I'd still love a chance to give the 3D version a chance.  As it is, the non-3D disc available still manages to be a worthy part of the saga, though not a high point.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Two very damaged souls embark on a collision course"></head><body><p>Ashley's son was kidnapped in a grocery store, her slimey ex still blames her.  She's working at a bar and one nite her and a friend give a strange man a ride.  She lets the stranger stay on her couch, she has a soft spot for him, maybe a substitute for her missing son? He's a soldier that has gone awol.  He is very intelligent, and a lot of things he says actually make sense, however, he also could be very dangerously insane.  The bugs he see's everywhere, did the military implant them in his body? She starts seeing them or maybe she just wants to please him so he won't leave her, she's pretending she see's them. It's up to the viewer, where the bugs real?  was the couple insane?  was he insane and just took her along for the ride? The performances were excellent, the two main characters played off each other well. This movie is not for the squeamish, so be warned.  Very, very intense.</p></body></html>

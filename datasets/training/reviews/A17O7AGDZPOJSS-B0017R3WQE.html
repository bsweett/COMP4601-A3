I have watched this movie about 20 times in my life thats a lot if you stop to think about it  this is almost 3 hours long and Iam sure it will make its way into my dvd player many more times This is one of the most influential movies you can watch of someone who has gone from nothing and became something, "first you gotta get the money , then you gotta get the power , then when you got the money and the power then you get the wonmen"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's Certainly Original"></head><body><p>This slightly mean-spirited, vaguely intelligent movie contantly reaches in and drags laughter out of you, whether you want to give it up or not. Yes, it's at times hilarious, and yes, it's a LOT more crude than the innocent old Borat sketches used to be (ah, the simple fun of Borat's country-western rendition of "Throw The Jew Down The Well") and I'll admit parts of this movie left me open-mouthed with well-deserved shock, but it's every bit as disturbingly funny as it was promised to be, so it gives you your money's worth. And everything you've heard about it that you can't make yourself believe could possibly be true is actually probably 100% true, including a nihilistic pseudo-homoerotic nude wrestling match between Borat and his producer.<br /><br />Just in a side note, I really think the Pamela Anderson segment was totally rehearsed and staged, as were the part with the bear, and also the old Jewish couple who operated the bed and breakfast. The B&B part was a total setup, maybe even done in a set with actors, but most of the rest of this movie I do think rang impressively true. (Particularly those South Carolina frat boys!)<br /><br />Borat's movie is funny, and it does expose hypocrisies and shed light on some American cultural attitudes, but above all this is humor at its most unapologetically raw.</p></body></html>

I still think it's bad.<br /><br />Main problem was that they had two sci-fi premises that didn't belong in the same movie.  There was the idea that there hasn't been a baby born in 18 years:  a serviceable idea.  Then there was the idea of a police state based on evicting immigrants:  another quite viable idea.<br /><br />But what these ideas were doing in the same movie was beyond me.  Either of them could have carried the movie, but shoehorning them together didn't work well.</p></body></html>

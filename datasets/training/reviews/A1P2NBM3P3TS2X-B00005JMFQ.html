<meta name="summary" content="Funny, sweet, but WAY too sappy far too often"></head><body><p>Generally I really like the film scripts that Richard Curtis has written.  This one is no exception, but in this film, his directorial debut (I think), he ups the "sappy" quotient a few notches too high.<br /><br />A few examples:  the musicians rising up from the pews after the wedding ceremony to add musical accompaniment to the Beatles song, Liam Neeson's kid learning the drums practically overnight to win the affections of the most popular girl in school (whose singing in the film looks more like another pop-music video than anything else), and several other hokey sentimental moments that add too much saccharine to the proceedings.  On paper those moments are okay, but the way they are shot cinematically cheapens the film.<br /><br />Good moments abound too, however:  Emma Thompson's Christmas Eve realization that her husband Alan Rickman is unfaithful leads to an acting moment that ranks with Thompson's best work, and the sweetly romantic scene where Colin Firth clumsily proposes in another language to Lucia Moniz.<br /><br />There are too many good things about this movie to write it off as a sappy piece of fluff, but there are too many sappy moments in this film that compromise the "structural integrity" of the script.<br /><br />DVD bonus features are what we've come to expect nowadays:  Commentary and another little feature or two.<br /><br />Worth watching?  Oh yes.  Worth buying to watch over and over?  Depends if you're diabetic and have a tolerance for sugary sappiness.</p></body></html>

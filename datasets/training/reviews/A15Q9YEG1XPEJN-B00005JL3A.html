<meta name="summary" content="Slick film that offers plenty of chills and jolts!"></head><body><p>Resident Evil is one of those films that I said, "Ah, I'll wait until it gets to video to see it."  I didn't expect it to be any good - not really.  How could it be?  It is based on a video game.  Now, I actually liked Mortal Kombat, which is also based on a video game (it wasn't great, but it was fun) - and I didn't know that the same director was responsible for it.  So, I was expecting the worst.  I was wrong.<p>As someone completely unfamiliar with the video game on which the film is based, I didn't know what to expect.  In short, Resident Evil is about a group of "security" personnel who work for a huge conglomerate that is doing all sorts of research - some of it suspect.  One of their more sinister viruses is released and they must go into the secret facility where it is created to try to fix things.  Little do they know that they will be facing all sorts of creepy security devices and ... zombies.<p>Milla Jovovich is the female lead and she manages to carry the film well.  I'm really not that informed on her background, but I will say that while she probably doesn't have a great depth of talent at her disposal, she is a capable actress and I liked her in her role.  To say that she was believable would be impossible, as I don't know that such a person could exist (how many zombie fighters do you know?).<p>Sadly, the men in this film are almost interchangeable.  I really didn't know who was who until names started getting fired off and I actually bothered to pay attention.  They all sort of look the same.  There are two other women in the film too, and I didn't realize it until one of them gets injured - they look the same as well.<p>The interesting thing in this sci-fi/horror film is that the horror aspects were not the ones I found frightening.  It was the sci-fi stuff.  The whole zombie aspect seems to be ground better covered by George Romero in Dawn of the Dead.  In fact, the zombie mythos seems to be taken directly from Romero's film:  they move slowly, they look terrible, and they eat flesh of the living.  If you get bitten, scratched, etc. by one of the undead, you, too, will become one of the undead.<p>The sci-fi angle worked better for me (and I don't really like sci-fi).  I found the security devices and the assorted set pieces to be very intimidating and frightening.  I definitely was feeling the suspense.<p>Part of the fun for me was that I DIDN'T know about the video game.  Why? I didn't know what was going on.  The beginning of the film was very confusing as I didn't understand what was happening or why it was happening.  Fortunately, the screenwriters did a very good job of having a few of the characters actually explain the subject to me - and it was done well - as a few of the other characters were designed to be as confused as I was.<p>The script, the sets, the make-up, and the actors made this a very enjoyably scary film.  I actually recommend it and give it four stars when compared with other films of this genre.<p>The DVD extra features are rather standard and I didn't avail myself of all of them.  However, as DVD extras become the norm, I think we'll see more and more added features for big budget films and more of the "standard fare" extras, such as these, offered:  Director and actor commentary, subtitles, music video, biographies of the actors, etc.<p>Have yourself a good scare and watch this film.</p></body></html>

Chicago What a Show Stopper!"></head><body><p>I am speechless i must say the whole film is pure fun & it will knock your socks off,not to mention anything on your body that is'nt nailed down . i thought i'd be great but it was better than i expected, bravo to cast you blew me out of water thank you for making a fun romp of a show 10 stars to ya . it will engross your senses you'll wonder where the time went, i'd gladly pay the money again to see it .<p>Highly recommend . it's a movie that plays like a play because it is one . oh by the way for you richard gere fans out there richard does sing in this picture , it's musical but no embarrassing moments like many other pictures i've seen, just plain fun & great music . but the show stealers are queenie, zeta jones, renee. queenie ought to do more R&B than rap . dang renee & zeta you guys work good together hope to see in alot more pictures as duo.</p></body></html>

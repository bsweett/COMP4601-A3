<meta name="summary" content="Superbly acted meditation on honour and loyalty"></head><body><p>Superbly acted saga on the Russian mafia in London. Has echoes of "The Godfather" and the machinations of the Russian nobility. Not really an action film, more a meditation on loyalty and honour. Told with maximum impact by director David Cronenberg, who continues his excellent partnership with Viggo Mortensen from "A History of Violence" (2005). Only a few inconsistent plot points and an abrupt ending detract from this film.</p></body></html>

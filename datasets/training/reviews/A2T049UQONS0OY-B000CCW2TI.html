<meta name="summary" content="A high ocatane thriller with a big laugh"></head><body><p>Wes Craven's thriller "RedEye" takes about 20 minutes to get rolling, then spends the rest of its brief running time -- only 1 hour and 19 minutes -- in a high octane murder plot and chase that hardly spares you a second to breathe or run to the bathroom without missing something important.<br /><br />And it does this mostly on board an airplane in scenes that pull off one of the great ironic puns in cinema history. This because the airline the heorine and bad guy are flying on is called Fresh Air.<br /><br />Some nice scenes at L.A. International Airport and in Miami add realism to the storyline, which is pretty familiar but carried out very well by the actors. Craven's direction and strong film editing also star in this little movie, which delivers quite a wallop in a short stay.<br /><br />The story concerns a young heroine (Rachel McAdams) and a really good looking bad guy (Cillian Murphy) who play tug of war on an airliner as the bad guy tries to help off a government official. Our heroine tries not to be extorted and to save her dad at the same time. The bad guy has an associate ready to delete her father if she doesn't cooperate.<br /><br />The story becomes pretty predictable but still continues to surprise as it goes along. Scenes from the very beginning of the movie, cast under the weight of opening credits, come back during a fishing trip that really help deliver some action.<br /><br />This didn't win any awards and none of the actors are big stars, but don't let that stop you from spending the better part of an hour and a half with this DVD if you enjoy mystery, action or engaging filmmaking. It's a small movie but also a good one, clearly above average regardless of its budget or star appeal.</p></body></html>

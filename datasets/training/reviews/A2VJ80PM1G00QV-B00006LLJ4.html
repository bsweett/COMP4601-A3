<meta name="summary" content="ACTORS PERFORM WELL, SCRIPT AND DIRECTION NOT SO WELL"></head><body><p>One major difficulty with a film of this sort is that seriously intended hocus-pocus will turn into comic hocus-pocus. I wouldn't say that this film slid over that line but it does come very close a number of times. For me,having Tom Cruise, in particular, make funny looking gestures and do awkward looking things, however justified by the written word of the script, detracts from my acceptance of the film . At any rate, I was left in something of a muddle as to whether I liked it or not, whether I thought anyone else would like it. Not having resolved that issue in my mind, I will simply say that most of the performers did quite well under the circumstances, there were some quite workable scenes, and there were all sorts of machines and gadgets to satisfy the fans of such. Those who find incredible plots and action generally inane or uninteresting should steer clear.</p></body></html>

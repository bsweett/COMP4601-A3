It continues to captivate its audiences, as I witness my nephews now caught up in its imaginative, accessible story and  engrossing characters.  While I still prefer the version without the  special improvements, as they were, this movie will always deliver.  It is  the perfect popcorn adventure, with dashing leads, a swashbuckling sci-fi  story, lots of fun stuff to pepper the proceedings, and a symphony to  underscore it all.  Good vs. evil, and guess who wins?  The ending, which  feels like the finale to a big musical, has you grinning from ear to ear.</p></body></html>

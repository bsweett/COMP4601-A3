<meta name="summary" content="First Contact-The best of the New Gen Flicks!"></head><body><p>Another of my "retro-reviews","Star Trek:First Contact" is by far and away the best of the new generation movies made.<br />The movie sets the mood and pace almost right from the get go.The Earth is being assaulted by a Borg cube ship but the Enterprise is told to stand down and is sent to a remote section of the quadrant to do some star mapping.This step has been apparently taken by the Earth governing hierarchy due to Picards' assimilation by the Borg years before.<br />The battle is listened to closely by the bridge crew and all is not going well.When Picard cannot take anymore he hurries back to Earth to help.They arrive in the nick of time and help to destroy the cube ship.But a Borg escape pod gets away and hurls earthward.The Enterprise pursues and goes through the same time portal the escape pod creates.They are taken back to the year 2063 and it seems the Borg are here to stop Zephram Cochran(inventor of warp drive)from taking his first flight(due to be the next day) and conquer Earth itself;to change the future for their own purposes.<br />The Enterprise closes in on the pod which is firing Earthward and destroys it.Unbeknownst to the crew though,a party of Borg transported aboard the ship,seconds before its' destruction.The Enterprise crew lands on Earth and meets the warp drive inventor and assists him in every way possible so he makes the all important flight.Besides the flight being a first test for warp drive it will also lead to a first contact situation with intelligent alien life which in turn will lead the Earth on its' path towards permanent space exploration.<br />During all this time with Cochran the crew slowly realizes and starts to come to grips with the Borg threat aboard the Enterprise.<br />Several crew members are taken hostage and assimilated including Data.Picard eventually gives himself to the Borg who are lead by a queen.<br />It's touch and go but Picard with Data's help,eventually defeats the queen and her coterie.The ship is saved from destruction and Cochrans' historic flight takes place as it should with the positive resultant effects.<br />The movie rarely stops for a moment as the pace is relentless and it keeps you focused all the time.All of the new gen crew are there who do a good job playing the characters to a tee from the TV show and even DS9 is given a nod as Worf comes aboard after having lead an almost fatal attack against the Borg on the Defiant.The queen Borg is played by Alice Krige who gives a great performance with just the right amount of omnipotence and menace coupled with a good measure of faux sincerity in her voice and body language.<br />There are some very minor drawbacks here and there in this film.The biggest one however is Zephram Cochran himself.Anyone in the least familiar with Star Trek,and the original series in particular,knows  about Cochran.Captain Kirk met Cochran on a far away planet in one of the better known eps.There are slight differences in detail from the Cochran of Picard and the one of Kirk.Not the least of which being their physical appearances and mannerisms.There is very little if anything one can match up between the two actors or their characters,only that we are supposed to believe that they are one and the same Cochran.The writers knew they were taking a chance with this aspect and while over-all plot wise it works,with me there's always that thing in my head that keeps saying:"No,these are just NOT the same people".And that always creates that "bump" in an otherwise smooth ride.<br />Technically the print is crisp and clear and the transfer was very good.The two disc set here has alot of features to offer and should satisfy all the Trek fans.<br />In conclusion this is overall a really good movie and a worthy entry in the Star Trek cannon.Its' plot is quick and well thought out and the acting is spot on throughout and Ms.Kriges' performance as a Borg queen is a standout.If your a Star Trek fan this movie deserves a spot on your shelf.It's just too bad the follow ups to this didn't come close in script and execution.</p></body></html>

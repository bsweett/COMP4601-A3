<meta name="summary" content="Pacing and Miscasting hurt this film."></head><body><p>I was enthusiastic about seeing this film.  The cast and story really held a lot of promise, and reviews I had read up to that point were promising.<p>While it was a text book 'good film,' I just couldn't buy Tom Hanks as an assassin.  I certainly don't fault Hanks for this, but the way the character was written, I didn't see much opportunity to develop that aspect of a redemptive-cold blooded killer.  If this premise doesn't work for the main character, suspending disbelief for the rest of the film is a little difficult as well.<p>And the pacing.  While it's not a lightening-charged piece of entertainment, the pace is slow and methodical.  But sometimes it gets so slow that your mind is given ample opportunity to wander.  A well-constructed film doesn't give you the chance to do that.  I felt this could have easily lost 30 minutes and been better for it.<p>I can't give this a hearty recommendation, but if you insist, it's not a bad film.</p></body></html>

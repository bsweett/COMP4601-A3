<meta name="summary" content="TERRIFIC LITTLE GEM"></head><body><p>Mixed reviews did not bode well for this terrific little gem that lives up to the graphic novel and delivers an unvarnished, unfiltered take on the whole super hero syndrome in life and art.  Profane and violent, here's what happens when you don a mail-order wetsuit and set out to fight crime.  It gets painful and bloody fast as certain death beckons.  And then you are saved by Big Daddy and Hit Girl -- a disturbed comic artist father, and adolescent daughter who are fearless, crazier than you and superbly trained in lethal martial arts.  Good and evil have their showdown in a satisfying battle that for once lives up to the title.  No doubt there's meaning here, but I'm still working it out.  Not for all tastes.</p></body></html>

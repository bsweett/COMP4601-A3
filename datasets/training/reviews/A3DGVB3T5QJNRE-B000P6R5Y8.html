<meta name="summary" content="A Very Depressing Movie That Plays With Your Head!"></head><body><p>This would be a great film to show in a college level grief counseling class or a course dealing with Post Traumatic Stress disorders. Nor am I being sarcastic. Bridge to Terabithia is truly a legitimate film to study in a college psychology course dealing with these issues.  It shows the adults  in the story trying their best to help the surviving child cope with an all too common tragedy -  death by drowning of a friend.<br /><br />However, this film is overwhelming with grief.  I have enough in my own personal life, as many of us do, that I don't need to pay to watch it on the big screen, too.  I'm not asking for only mindless entertainment. But when out-of-the-blue, in the middle of the story, in what started off as a delightful fantasy - turns into a gloomy melodrama - then I have a problem reconciling my need for entertainment with the filmmaker's need to demoralize his or her audience!<br /><br />I also want to make it clear this movie is not appropriate for young children, unless you want to expose them to the tragedy of sudden death, and all its raw emotions.<br /><br />Its extremely rare that a film leaves me in such a sour mood. Perhaps it's because, as a young teen, a classmate of mine drowned since he did not know how to swim. A stupid way to die - to put it mildly. So if any lesson can be taken from this movie it is this:  Make sure you teach your children how to swim - along with making them understand & respect the power of water!</p></body></html>

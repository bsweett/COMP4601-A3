<meta name="summary" content="The Korean Monster Mash....."></head><body><p>(Possible Spoilers)<br /><br />There's some illegal dumping going on, a little amphibious creature falls into a body of water and swim off, then a few years later on the shores of the Han River in South Korea, some onlookers see a strange creature hanging from a bridge, it drops into the river and soon after comes to the shore. This creature proceeds to wreak havoc, by knocking around the nearby tents and food stands, stomping and knocking people out of the way, killing a few and in this whole melee it takes the daughter of a young man named Park Gang-Doo (Kang-ho Song, "Thirst") and jumps back into the Han River.<br /><br />The remainder of the movie involves Gang-Doo and his extended family trying to find his daughter and kill this creature. There's equal parts comedy, drama and some good scares from the monster attacks on the locals, the dialogue which is mainly subtitled outside of a few american actors is pretty good and witty. The opening monster attack is probably one of the best sequences ever in these type of movies, it stays at a great pace and the creature is fairly unique looking (not an easy thing to do since most everything has been done to death when it comes to monster design).<br /><br />Loved the scenes too with the daughter and another captured boy as they were pretty much how any kid would try to deal with the horror that surrounds them. There's the underlying story in the movie about whether the government is lying about this monster carrying a deadly virus and that it needs to be avoided (cause the first thing any rational person would do is approach a deadly creature like that, right?).<br /><br />What makes "The Host", way, way better than most any monster flick is how layered it is, director Bong Joon-Ho keeps it balanced, the horror appears in good spots, the comedy is good and refreshing and the acting actually is pretty good, with most of the actors appearing quite believable. I highly recommend "The Host" to anyone that enjoys monster films, you just have to be prepared to read (if you watch the subtitled version that is, which is the best way in my opinion).<br /><br />The extras include: Deleted scenes, commentary from Bong Joon-Ho, making of "The Host", special effects featurette, cast interviews, a gag reel and much more.</p></body></html>

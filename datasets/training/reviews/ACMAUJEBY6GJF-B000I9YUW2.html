<meta name="summary" content="Well, far from being forgotten, it's not totally unforgettable..."></head><body><p>...and actually in the start (the first 45 minutes or so) I found myself missing the unpleasant atmosphere required from any good supernatural thriller. But then; Bang! I jumped high in my seat four times after I had reached the last part of the movie (and when finally it begins). The special effects including the sound is amazing, and sneakes in on the viewer unexpected and sudden -just when I was getting a little bored (not that the story is non-involving, it's interesting and had my attention absolutely -well, it starts out a bit slow) things start to take a different turn than what I had expected. Not that the plot is Sixth Sence-amazing, but the film-makers have done their very best with what they've had to work with. So, where "White Noise" failed to have a completed plot but managed to contain the scary atmosphere instead -it's sometimes the oposite with "The Forgotten". But some scenes here were really amazing, and the movie is highly entertaning. This being said; I am a big fan of the supernatural thriller genre, and I find this among the better. And it was less X-files than I feared. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

It's better than De Niro's other recent thriller, which involved cloning(the title escapes me right now).  But in the long run, it's just another run-of-the-mill, cookie-cutter thrill flick.<br /><br />Dakota Fanning is sufficient as DeNiro's daughter who has become rather silent and stand-offish since walking in on her mother's successful suicide attempt.  DeNiro moves to the country hoping to bring her out of her shell.  Unfortunately for the both of them, Fanning finds a new "imaginary" friend who commits some rather ghastly deeds and makes her take the blame.  Famke Janssen plays Fanning's psychiatrist and close friend and former student of DeNiro.  Elizabeth Shue has a small role as a country local who DeNiro has a sweet spot for.<br /><br />The climax of the film is what makes it fail in the end.  It sort of ruins the "evil" atmosphere that is set by Fanning's creepy performance.<br /><br />Only recommended to fans of DeNiro and modest thrillers.  I would steer clear of purchasing this until I've viewed it as a rental or on TV.  You may not want to commit too much money to this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pure cheese, yet undeniable greatness"></head><body><p>This is a movie that has grown on me with age. I love it now for what it is and always has been. Army of Darkness solidified Bruce Campbell as a cult hero and he carries this film with his funny line delivery and one huge chin. The special effects and sets are pretty bad, but it's all about the campy fun from start to finish. There are some classic scenes and lines you will feel compelled to quote to people, probably getting you many blank stares from those who have not witnessed Ash in action.<br /><br />I have the Boomstick version with the original and director's cut. I like them both, but the picture quality sucks on the DC, so I usually watch the theatrical version.</p></body></html>

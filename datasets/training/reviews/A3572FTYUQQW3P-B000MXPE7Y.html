<meta name="summary" content="The Walking Dead"></head><body><p>This is a great film and one that I highly recommend, but it is not without flaws.  I won't rehash th plot because other reviewers have already done a much better job than I could do. But first the flaws and these are truly minor.  The costuming and set design were very well done, but Matt Damon's makeup was poor.  We watched him over a period of 30+ years and he never gained weight, turned gray, lost hair, or showed any sign of age, unlike Joilie who looked more mature at the end than she did at the beginning. The sound could have been better because some lines were muffled and in this film every line is important.  The organization of the film -- which is done in flashbacks -- could be better because it was hard to track the sequence of events but the footnotes in the corner helped, but if you miss one you are at sea as to what is going on.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is an excellent film and Matt Damon does a good job and the story is very similar to the George Smiley Tinker Tailor Spy.  Alec Guniness is more convincing as a spymaster but the destruction of Edward Wilson is more easily observed than with George Smiley but both characters end as The Walking Dead -- hollow men, wrapped in honor but devoid of family, friends, intimacy, trust, or anything worth living for other than God and Country.<br /><br />I thought this film really brought forth the reality that our government is dominated by the Ivy League Patricians.  This has been true throughout the 20th Century and it is this "old boy" network that has created compromised politicians, led to corruption in government, and has placed the country at risk on more than one occasion.<br /><br />The movie presents a variety of moral and ethical decisions which makes this film a good one to watch and discuss with your teenage children.  Edward Wilson's march to personal destruction is determined by individual decisions -- some small -- like the sexual encounter with Clover, which had disastrous results -- and some large -- like the decision to join the OSS.  The decision to spy on his professor was an ethical one but one that characterized Edward Wilson as a man who placed country above himself.  This dedication ultimately leads him to the heart rending decision regarding his son, which leaves him compromised.  This is a film with very complex characters whose motives are deep rooted and not easily discerned during the movie itself, but become clearer on reflection.  It vividly demonstrates the corrosiveness of secrets - especially on families.<br /><br />Some of the reviewers didn't like the film because it was too slow and too long.  It has a slow pace -- but these are spies not Tom Cruise on a "Mission Impossible" more aptly titled a "Mission Improbable".  It has no car chases, bombs, babes, or any of the usual fare that appeals to the adolescent mind. This is a thinking man's movie and an exceptional one at that.  It definitely deserves the 5 stars.</p></body></html>

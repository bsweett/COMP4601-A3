The elder Blaze dies doing a motorcycle stunt, but not from cancer  as the devil (played by Peter Fonda) promised.<br /><br />So adult Johnny Blaze is a motorcycle stunt man protected by the devil, he takes risks a normal person wouldn't. This  daredevil has a childhood love, which comes back  into his life (Eva Mendes).<br /><br />Then the son of the devil sends him on an assignment with he does not do well, but he morfs into  the skelton figure of Ghost Rider. He meets Caretaker (played in great form by Sam Elliot) and he  changes his wreckless ways. . One wonders who they didnt get Ghost Riders in the Sky--maybe too campy!<br /><br />The beginning is strong in this film. The middle will lose a few. But the climatic battle between Good and Bad seem a CGI master stroke. The CGI is amazing, worth four stars to see this heavy laiden effect film<br /><br />I will say this, they film acts like a western morales play of old with a modern twist. One would hope Cage is signed for a sequel<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD</p></body></html>

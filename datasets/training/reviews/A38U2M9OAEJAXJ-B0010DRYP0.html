<meta name="summary" content="The Film is a Classic, but the DVD is a BUST!"></head><body><p>The same year Francis Ford Coppola hit the skids with his flawed "Godfather 3," Martin Scorcese reminded us how well-made mob movies are done with "Goodfellas." Here's the story of the rise and fall of a mobster, covering a span of 30 years from the 1950s to the 1980s. Although DeNiro gets top billing in this film, this is really a Ray Liotta movie all the way. It's surprising his career never took off after this movie, for his performance is really good. But while this film is undeniably a classic, the DVD itself is a bust. Although it is slightly over two hours, the film is divided on both sides of the DVD. I refuse to get up off my sofa to flip this disc over when the whole movie could be put on one side.  Plus, all we get for features is a trailer. No documentary, no commentary, or anything else. If you have to have this film, you are no worse off getting the VHS tape and waiting for Warners to come out with a deluxe-edition of this great film.</p></body></html>

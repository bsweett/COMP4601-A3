<meta name="summary" content="Light-weight horror"></head><body><p>There is an interesting concept buried in this film however either the director or the powers that be decided to play it safe and in the end served up an unimpressive horror movie.  It's pretty bad when your red herrings are OBVIOUS red herrings and motivation is given through a montage of events that happened off camera.  It's a shame because it really could have been much better.  Plus, the whole tagline of 'come out come out whereever you are' lost it's power with this viewer because it was such a powerful line in Cape Fear that I felt the film-makers were stealing from an earlier DeNiro film.  I don't think the acting was bad as some have reported, I believe the downfall were the decisions to play it safe.  Overall, it's just an okay movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well despite what people say, the 3D works well enough"></head><body><p>I followed all the tips I read online. Wore both pairs of glasses, sat in the dark about 9 feet back from my TV, dead centre. For the most part the 3D works really good, especially when there is some solid reference items in the foreground. Adds great depth to the scene. The only time the image splits into two really obviously is when things come hurtling out of the screen and even then, not every time. There is some stunning 3D parts with leaves blowing around in the storm. Occasionally for no apparent reason thing with blur into a double image in the background but this soon rights itself. When its at its best the images look pristine so I was expecting the 2D version to be absolutely stunning. I was dissappointed to find it was quite grainy. I would recommend watching the 3D version in 3 half hour increments as it can give you a headache wathcing for too long.<br />The film itself adds nothing to the mythology but because of making use of 3D it force the dirctor to make each shot as interesting as possible andyou get a lot of great shots. Story wise its a throw away but entertainment wise it work well.</p></body></html>

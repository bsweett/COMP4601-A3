<meta name="summary" content="Pools of Sorrow, Waves of Joy"></head><body><p>Across the Universe is a musical directed by Julie Taymor (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6ESKS">Titus</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLPK">Frida</a>).  The film incorporates over 30 songs from The Beatles into its story and is loaded with endless references to other Beatles' songs and associated lore.  As a tribute the film is outstanding.  As a film it is as visually beautiful as any movie released in 2007 and is definitely worth owning on blu-ray if you are a Beatles fan or, at the very least, you're familiar enough with their catalogue that the many references to their music are not over your head.  The other big bonus in Across the Universe is its young cast.  The film includes great performances from Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood especially.  I did not know that Wood could sing and evidently she can.<br /><br />The story may sound secondary and it isn't particularly important, primarily because it is not the film's strength.  So I won't dwell on it too much.  It is set in the 1960s as Liverpudlian Jude (Sturgess) heads off to the states to find his father.  When he gets there he befriends Max (Joe Anderson) and his sister Lucy (Wood).  He falls for Lucy amid a backdrop of the Vietnam War and the timely protests.  There are subplots involving other supporting characters with names referencing Beatles songs (i.e. Sadie, Prudence, Jojo) as well. In addition, there are many other interesting details I should leave out.  Suffice to say, Bono as Dr. Robert singing I am the Walrus is great, and Eddie Izzard's entry as Mr. Kite is fun and perhaps appropriately reminiscent of some of Monty Python's work.  The film also includes cameos from Joe Cocker and Salma Hayek.<br /><br />There are things that might dissuade someone's interest in this movie.  Firstly, if you don't like the Beatles, then you probably won't like this.  It is saturated in everything Beatles.  Secondly, if you don't like Taymor's work then you may not appreciate this either.  Taymor tends to put style first and Across the Universe's greatest strengths, even beyond it's amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WCBPOG">soundtrack</a>, is how the film appears.  Taymor's films are visually immaculate and she wants everything about the story and the characters to melt into the visual elements.  She succeeds here of course and Across the Universe is undeniably a beautiful looking and sounding movie but the viewer is left to decide if they care about that or not.  There are also flashes of her theatrical influences that might strike some viewers as odd but I actually wanted even more of it.  Overall, I enjoyed the film very much and rank it up there as among the best of 2007.</p></body></html>

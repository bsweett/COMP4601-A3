People get fired without such elaborate procedures. Repeating the scenarios of interviewing and firing, over and over, hints to the weakness and redundancy of the story. I enjoyed the aerial shots of cities and clouds from high in ski, but could not put up with the redundant and repetitive airport sceneries that serve no purpose other than killing movie time<br /><br />Though the movie deals with modern day business model, it succeeded in portraying the human feeling of those involved. The leathery face of a young and inexperienced executive, contrasted with the lively complexion of a seasoned executive, both were neatly contrasted with the feeble and vulnerable worn down employees. The two executives acting in their official capacities must work like vampires, cloaked under professionalism, to convey the bad news to the newly fired folks. Each of the two executive vampires will be again transformed to humans only when their romantic relationships crash as a result from their unsettling life-style.<br /><br />"Up in the air" is a great title when viewed on its most critical statement: "we take the most fragile people and set them adrift". Most of those set adrift were indeed too fragile to survive the jolt of unemployment. Here, the movie departed from showing what those people did wrong to deserve such destiny, while it focused on an irrelevant and unreasonable concern of a remotely located executive, watching the drama unfolding on his screen.<br /><br />Turning the table on those cold-blooded executives, the movie exposes the dryness of emotion that reflected on their personal lives. The most ambitious and brilliant young woman exited soon before losing her identity. The long-timer executive, after accumulating millions of travel miles, could not find true love when he thought he was in control. Neither the emptiness of soul helped the highly paid executive to relate to his closest relatives, nor did their unsettled life bring them to live real.</p></body></html>

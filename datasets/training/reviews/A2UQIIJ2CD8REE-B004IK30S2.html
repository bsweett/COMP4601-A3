<meta name="summary" content="One of Ferrell's Brightest Moments!"></head><body><p>In the 1970's, the television news scene was a man's world, and the local news anchor was king! In San Diego, that king was Ron Burgundy, a ladies' man, man's man, man about town. Ron loved his city, and his city loved him. This all changed when the first female anchor came onto the scene. When Ron met Veronica Corningstone, it was love at first sight, but his male-chauvinist, co-worker pals, Champ Kind of Sports, on-the-scene reporter Brian Fantana, and mentally challenged weatherman Brick, weren't ready to give up their friend, or their newsroom, without a fight. When Ron and Veronica's fledgling relationship suddenly goes sour as a result of her promotion to a lead anchor, the boys are happy again to have Ron back as their leader, until Veronica exacts her revenge and turns the entire city against him!<br /><br />While his best film thus far would have to be the charming, stylish, instant Christmas classic "Elf," "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" may always be considered the quintessential Will Ferrell comedy. Hilariously silly 99.9% of the time and recapturing the tackiness of the '70s throughout, if you love comedy and Will Ferrell, this film is a must have. The ensemble cast features some of the best comedic actors of the 21st century in both major and minor roles, from Steve Carell as Brick Tamland to Fred Willard as newsroom chief Ed Harkin; from Christina Applegate as Veronica Corningstone to Jack Black as a very angry biker! The humor is random and unpredictable, the performances are spot on, the "Afternoon Delight" scene is unforgettably funny, and yes, there's a story too. Good stuff all around!<br /><br />The Unrated, Widescreen DVD doesn't disappoint much in the extras department either. Granted, the DVD commentary is mostly a waste of time. It's basically just Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay cracking wise about everything BUT the movie, which they hardly even talk about, along with some other cast members (a few simply call in) and some completely unrelated guests. The commentary is wacky, but while I usually love Will Ferrell's comedic antics, it's mostly not as funny as it tries to be. There's a ton of other stuff too though. We get a Ron Burgundy interview with Rebecca Romijn Stamos from MTV, a wealth of deleted scenes and outtakes, a hilarious "Afternoon Delight" music video, an interview with Ron, a making-of featurette, an ESPN audition, and a ton of text bios and production notes! My only regret is not getting the release packed with "Wake Up, Ron Burgundy," which is supposedly like having an entire second Ron Burgundy movie to enjoy!</p></body></html>

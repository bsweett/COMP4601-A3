<meta name="summary" content="It's all about the restoration (and some of the new bonuses)."></head><body><p>NOTE: This review is based on the 2012 Blu-ray Collectors' Edition Combo. Amazon has an odd policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL versions of a movie that is released on home video. So, to make the most use of the hundreds of reviews listed for TKAM, click on the "show all reviews" link and then sort by "Newest First". Then look at date of the review. Now on to my review:<br /><br />First off, I've always loved this film and it was the story, acting and the photography that always captured me since I saw the film when it was released. It was in black and white (and growing up we only had a black and white TV, so I was used to this). The film looked "okay" on VHS and then, in 1998 Universal released it on DVD in a Collector's Edition. This included the film plus a full length commentary and the (then) new feature-length documentary. This was great.. but the film had not been "restored".<br /><br />Now Universal has restored it and the print is great. They brought back the above noted bonus features and added more! The bonuses amount to more viewing time than the feature film (almost four times!). The DVD version of the new release contains all the featurettes while the Blu-ray combo pack Collectors' Edition ads the book with rare photos etc and high-def of the special features. So if you don't have a BD player yet you won't miss out on the wonderful special features. And if you have not seen the documentary before, it will blow you away. (By the way, after you've absorbed ALL the featurettes on this set, seek out the new documentary, "Hey Boo, Harper Lee and To Kill a Mockingbird" which I reviewed last year. Both of these DVDs belong in every home.<br /><br />For all the material on this marvelous set from Universal, a copy belongs in every home - especially one with pre-teen and teenage children. And with a selling price on Amazon as low as it is, there is no reason not to buy a copy now! Thank you Universal for going the extra mile.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></body></html>

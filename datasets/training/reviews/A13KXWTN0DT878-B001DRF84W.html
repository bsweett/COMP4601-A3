<meta name="summary" content="Coming from a NonFan of the Comic"></head><body><p>Predictable. Longer than it should have been. Occasionally bogus CGI. And that's all that I found wrong with Ang Lee's Hulk. The story, the nonbogus CGI, and the action sequences were greatly cinematic.<p> I found it predictable because there was nothing new to be seen. I even thought of certain plot points a few seconds before they happened. To defend the movie, this only happened a few times. The remainder of the story carried the movie along well, and was great. I highly enjoyed the fact that there was a lot of drama and more of a psychological bend to the story. The CGI, and there was a ton of it, occasionally came off as bogus, but it was minimal. The first time the Hulk appeared is when it struck me as bogus, but as the movie went on, the Hulk began to look more and more real. Especially the water scenes and when he was running. I occasionally found the running time exasperating. I asked myself once "There's more?" only because although I expected there to be a closure with .. father, I didn't expect the ending that I got. The ending was quite out there too. <p> What really brought me along the movie was the acting. Eric Bana was excellent for the part. Prior to Hulk, I'd actually never heard of him. As Bruce, he hit every emotional note and carried the character well. Jennifer Connelly was beautiful here. Her acting - as always - was right on. The shots where she stared intensely at Bruce, and the camera lingered on her were incredible. Nick Nolte pulled off homicidal very well. He's ... always scared me personally. And Sam Ross's chemistry with Connelly made him a bit more of a character than he could have been. Meaning, seeing how he portrayed the love for his daughter, it made me like him a bit even though he knew he was doing what was best. Ang Lee did an amazing job with an amazing cast. <p> Since Hulk resides in the comic-to-film genre, I can say that even though it's not better than the X-Men series, it was a few steps up from Spiderman. I'd place it between Daredevil and Spiderman.</p></body></html>

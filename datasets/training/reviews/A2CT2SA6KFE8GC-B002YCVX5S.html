Initially I was kinda pissed at Tarantino, assuming he had jumped on the remake bandwagon by redoing Enzo Castellari's Italian war flick, Inglorious Bastards.  Thankfully, Tarantino didn't go that route.  Aside from the catchy(slightly altered) title, and the film being set during WWII, Tarantino's film has practically nothing to do with Castellari's film.  So that was a(pleasant)surprise.  Lots of folks hated this film.  Though I think many people know what to expect from Tarantino at this point, many folks still felt let down by this one.  I can only imagine that the modern filmgoer, who requires stimulation and action every two minutes or they get bored, was put off by the fact that this had little onscreen warefare action.  I can only imagine people were expecting two and a half hours of relentless Saving Private Ryan-type action.  Nope, doesn't happen.  Instead they got....uh oh....a plot that actually took it's time to unfold!  Imagine that nonsense!  Strike one.  Also, Brad Pitt is the star power, but people found that he doesn't have much screen time, and instead, much of the screen time is devoted to relatively unknown actors.  Personally, I thought this was great coz I don't care for Brad Pitt and I'm not sure how I would have responded to 150 minutes of his mug in every frame.  Strike two for all those Pitt fans who went to see it.  Then you got the dialogue.  Modern theatergoers can't stand dialogue driven films, and not only is this film dialogue driven to hell, but most of it is in subtitles!!  The one thing modern audiences hate more than Black and White film is subtitles!  Strike three.<br />Tarantino really pulled one over, didn't he?  He(God forbid)gave the film a slow, Sergio Leone type pacing(Tarantino always wears his influences on his sleeve, and Leone seems to be a big influence on this movie), he minimized the big Hollywood star's screen time and essentially made him a supporting character, and he had the Germans and the French speaking their native language.  Wow.<br />In a nutshell the plot is about a Jewish theater owner's plan to kill Hitler and many of the high ranking officials of the Nazi party when they all decide to attend a film premiere at her theater in 1944 Nazi occupied France.  Meanwhile, a small ragtag group of Jewish soldiers("The Basterds") led by Brad Pitt and his brutal right hand man played by Eli Roth(just when I was beginning to think we'd finally started seeing the end of this guy), are on a rage fueled mission to kill and scalp as many Nazis as possible.  The "Basterds" also find out about the film premiere and hatch their own plan to destroy Hitler and his Reich.  There are a few minor subpots and characters, but everything serves as a buildup to the night of the film premiere.<br />Basically what Tarantino did here(as he pretty much does with all of his movies)is made an exploitation film masquerading as a Hollywood film.  From the title cards introducing/pointing out characters, the minimal(and pointless) use of a narrator(Samuel L. Jackson), anachronistic music that includes 70s style funk, over-the-top performances and characters(Pitt especally), graphic gratuitous violence, and a total disregard for factual history make this a big exploitation film in a very thin disguise.  I mean, come on, all bets are off when Mike Myers appears in a small role, I don't care if he is playing it serious.  I realize that exploiting the atrocities of WWII for the sake of movie entertainment seems to be in very bad taste, but hey, it worked for Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS, and what household in America doesn't own and cherish a copy of that movie?<br />Some flak aimed at this movie comes from the fact that Jews are all portrayed as bloodthirsty savages bent on revenge.  So what?  If the same characters had been Irish, nobody would be saying anything.  Violent revenge films have existed for many years and span countless film genres.  There's really no point in reading into it all that deeply.  After all, this is a movie where Hitler walks out of the theater so he can ask the SS soldier standing guard for a piece of gum.<br />So, yeah, I thought this was a surprisingly good movie.  Sure it has it's faults.  It does suffer from a tad much of Tarantino's diarrhea of the mouth(though unlike the excruciating yammering of Death Proof, most of the dialogue here at least holds interest), and some scenes don't need to go on quite as long as they do, but for the mostpart I feel Tarantino succeeded in making his best film in quite a few years.</p></body></html>

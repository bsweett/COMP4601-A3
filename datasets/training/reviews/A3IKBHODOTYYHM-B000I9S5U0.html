<meta name="summary" content="Great story about overcoming odds during the Great Depression"></head><body><p>Cinderella Man, a biopic which chronicles the story of James J. Braddock, a boxer who fought Max Baer in a highly publicized title fight. Nicknamed the "Cinderella Man", Braddock became the symbol of those impoverished during difficult Depression times. Ron Howard does an effective job telling the story with the right balance of drama and mood.<br /><br />The first half of Cinderella Man moved a little slow, but I think it really captures what Depression-era life was like in the 30s. We get to see how the poor economy affected work and family life, especially Braddock, his wife and their children. People struggled to make ends meet, and had to find a way to survive. When Braddock's hand gets injured, he still has to find a way to get the job on the docks to support his family. I think director Ron Howard presented the story of Braddock with the right amount of sentimentality, not too overbearing, but just enough to make you invested in what he has gone through. When Braddock gets the opportunity to fight after suffering a hand injury, he takes this challenge. Renee Zellweger (Mae Braddock) and Russell Crowe (Jim Braddock) give fine performances, as their chemistry really works on screen.<br /><br />In the film's final moments, there is quite a build up to the fight at Madison Square Garden Bowl. This is really where Cinderella Man shines, and the symbol of Braddock's character is emphasized. Braddock represents the poor and impoverished, and goes into that title fight a huge underdog; it was a very moving and inspirational finish.<br /><br />Probably one issue with the film is how Howard presents Braddock's main challenger, Max Baer, who he presents as an opponent overbearing brutish, violent and smug person. Many have challenged this portrayal for its inaccuracies, and it does seem as though his character has been "Hollywoodized" into being the complete and total villain.<br /><br />Still, Cinderella Man is a great film, where the director manages to make a boxing film without really making a boxing film. This is a film about overcoming obstacles, about making it in a harsh world; it's really a film about life. The scenery and music score also give the film an authentic feel to its setting and times.<br /><br />The extras are worth a look, too, especially the commentary about the film.</p></body></html>

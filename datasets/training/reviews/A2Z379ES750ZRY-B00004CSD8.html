<meta name="summary" content="No point remake."></head><body><p>I'm not sure what the point of this remake is - other than to cash in on 6/62006.  There is no point of remaking scene for scene a classic movie, if almost all of those schenese are going to be substandard when compared to the original.  Atleast give us a creative re-interpretation to give a different perspective.<br /><br />Other than the opening scene which is not in the original movie, the rest of the movie is quite mediocre.  The worst of it is the Damien character and his forced "evil" look - how shallow -in the original the boy is portrayed as completely normal whereas in the remake Damien seems totally self aware of his evilness".<br />I liked the ambiguity of the original.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed...although the use of the "symbolic" red through seems a bit cheesy.</p></body></html>

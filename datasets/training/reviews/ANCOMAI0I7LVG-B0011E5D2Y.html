<meta name="summary" content="I'd crash this party if I were you..."></head><body><p>There was a lot of buzz surrounding this film back when it was released, and I must admit that while upon repeated viewings it doesn't hold up as strong as it once did it is still extremely funny.  Yes, `Wedding Crashers' may be one clich&eacute; after another, but those clich&eacute;s are strung together so effortlessly that you can't help but fall for each and every gag.<br /><br />The film follows two friends, John and Jeremy, who make a habit of crashing weddings to score with single chicks.  When they crash the wedding of Secretary William Cleary's daughter, Christina, they wind up on an adventure they didn't bank on.  At the wedding they each set their sights on one of Secretary Cleary's other daughters; Jeremy targeting the nymphomaniac Gloria and John seeking out the beautiful, yet spoken for, Claire.  When they wind up invited to the Cleary's estate for the weekend (who in their right mind would invite two men they've never met to their home for the weekend) hilarity ensues.  While John is busy trying to woo Claire away from her controlling boyfriend Zachary Jeremy is trying to ward off the advances of Gloria.<br /><br />I've never been a huge fan of Owen Wilson, and I still hold firm to the belief that he is only really `good' when paired with Ben Stiller (together they are flawless).  Here he winds up being the more straight laced actor and, while he has a few funny lines, really leaves the comedy aspect of the film up to scene partner Vince Vaughn.  `Wedding Crashers' marked Vaughn's rebirth so-to-speak, revitalizing his career thanks to one hilarious performance here (although I saw this coming since his glorious `Old School' turn).  I've always been a huge fan of Vaughn and loved some of his earlier work (I just adore his performances in films like `Return to Paradise' and `A Cool Dry Place') but it seemed like Hollywood had forgotten about him; and then there was `Wedding Crashers' and his career has never been the same.  I'm happy for him; he deserved it.<br /><br />Isla Fisher is really the standout here.  She has, undeniably, the scene-stealer role of the film and she does just that; steals scenes.  As Gloria she is sensual, abrasive, obnoxious, psychotic and most of all hilarious.  Rachel McAdams does a fine job as Claire in a role that is far less attention grabbing.  She is such a beautiful and talented actress.  I can't wait to see her career skyrocket.  Jane Seymour has a surprising turn here as the Secretary's unhappy wife and Ellen Alberti Dow is her usual funny self as the Cleary Grandmother.  Christopher Walken is quite simply Christopher Walken (shouldn't he be in like every movie).  Keir O'Donnell is a bit over the top as the strange Cleary son, Todd, and Bradley Cooper is kind of annoying as Zachary.  There is a brilliant cameo by Will Ferrell towards the end that makes me wish he had a larger role in the film.<br /><br />`Wedding Crashers' is not a god-send but it is well worth the watch through.  There are moments when the laughs will come so hard there will be tears and then times when the laughs are more of an embarrassed laugh.  It's truly a mixed bag, but there is more good then bad here, that's for sure.</p></body></html>

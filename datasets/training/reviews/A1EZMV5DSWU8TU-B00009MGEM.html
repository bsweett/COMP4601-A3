This presentation incorperates elements in a Twin Peaks / Lost Highway, David Lynch vein, with intermittant flashes of images projected to be disturbing with a seeming antithesis of the current scene at hand, as if the pleasant life memories of the victim display within their mind as they die, to accentuate the progressive horror of their demise. The movie begins with carnival music resurrected by Dr. LaVey in his infamous Music Room scene from Speak of The Devil, accompanied by a mascot with a bald head and goatee bouncing about the place from time to time. <p>Suburban college kids travel with their girlfriends in 1977 to persue the urban legend of &quot;Dr. Satan&quot; {obvious LaVey influence} and various roadside attractions of the bizarre kind along the way, when they come upon a backwoods museum of the strange, hosted by a yokle attired in clown motif who also runs a funhouse called &quot;The Murder Ride&quot; featuring true crime displays, including profiles on Albert Fish the cannibal, among others, infamous in those parts. <p>So the foursome are out to to find out if any of the tales are true. Little did they know that a short while earlier, the place was almost robbed by a couple of incompetent brutish bafoons who are quickly outwitted by the clown and his elderly friend, both experienced freaks of the trade. Yet the likes of this was to pale in comparison to what they were yet to experience for real. After having taken the Murder Ride Tour, quite enjoyable as it was, with the host displaying an attire similar to KIng Diamond's , including face-paint and top hat, they persist to interview the keeper more about the legend; so he decides to direct them to an area where it was said to have originated from. On the way, they pick ujp a delightfully doll-like cowgirl {played by Zombie's girlfriend / fiancee' &quot;Sherry&quot;} who leads them into a trap in alliance with a shadowy phantom in the wilderness who shoots their tire out from under them. She offers to walk over to her brother's, who just so happens to own a tow-truck - then the true horror begins - one by one they are preyed upon by the resident homicidal hellbillies in various methods of mutilation, psychological torture until death is mercifully bestowed, in a very Texas Chainsaw Massacre style. <p>One scenario that I found to be of particular and amusing mention was when the remaining two of the suburban four are marched off to meet Dr. Satan {also seems to be an exagerrated composit of Dr. Josef Mengele, the Angel of Death}, dressed in rabbit foo-foo costumes, which establishes the differentiation between the predator and the prey, both the more and less evolved creatures' interaction. Another notable bit was the use of Aleister Crowley's poem narration in slow-motion while the foos were being lowered into the Black Earth, while inside of a coffin displaying a cross on the lid, which I found to be meaningful symbolism, as crucifixes and crosses are symbols of death, which were also drawn upon one character's face who performed a priest role in the mock funeral of those who have gone below. <p>In the end, House of 1,000 Corpses is a recommended film, and definitely stands out amongst all of the films currently released in this time frame, but what really makes it work is the remarkable style of the 70's, which did spawn the remarkable constant-classic Halloween. And there have been few outright, gut-wrenching serious horror movies which have been able to reach this level of entertainment, most of which are usually relegated immediately to video shelves because they prove to be too frightening for the masses, but are preserved for the serious Horror fantom. This is not a goofy parody passed as a &quot;horror&quot; flick, as the humor herein is truly black, as My companion and I were the only ones in the theatre laughing many times. I noticed sheeple leaving on a couple of occasions, seemingly just too disturbed to remain there being subjected to the nightmarish progression therein, which I would consider to be quite a compliment for a horror writer, director, or producer, who also happens to be a Satanist. <p>&quot;There is no good or evil. You just do what you gotta' do.&quot;<br />________________________________ <p>Extra bit of horror trivia: There was also a movie named &quot;House of Seven Corpses&quot; starring John Carradine and John Ireland which was released in 1973.</p></body></html>

IT IS THE MOST CHARMING, UNUSUAL COMEDY I'VE SEEN IN YEARS! WILL, KEVIN, EVA THE ENTIRE CAST GAVE IT THEIR ALL TO MAKE THIS ONE OF THIS YEARS MOST DELIGHTFUL DVDS! AND THE FINALE, WELL NO SPOILERS HERE, BUT IT WAS TOTALLY WONDERFUL! EVERYONE CAN DANCE, CHARM, AND MAKE US GET LOST IN THE MOST WONDERFUL COMEDY OF THE YEAR. BRAVO MR. TENNANT, AND KUDOS TO THE ENTIRE CAST FOR PULLING THE WHOLE PACKAGE OFF! I TRULY LOVED IT-IT WAS THE MEDICINE I NEEDED FOR 2 WONDERFUL HOURS.  IT'S NOT TO BE MISSED.</p></body></html>

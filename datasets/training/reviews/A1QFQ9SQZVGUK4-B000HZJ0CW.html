<meta name="summary" content="Enough Brent Already! Geez!"></head><body><p>Once again this film (as does the DVD itself) has to be all about Brent Spiner.<p>Oh how I loathe his hammy acting and he just ruins this film. He co-wrote the script which pretty much gave him free reign to shut out other characters (Crusher, Riker, Geordi, even Worf!) while he, himself, got to play 2 roles! Data and B4! UNBELIEVABLE!<p>I purchased the DVD earlier today and was shocked to find that the entire packaging is centered around...you guessed it, Brent!<p>He appears on the front, the back, the side sleeve, the paper insert and even the disc! It would have been nice to have seen Picard alone, bit no..every picture of him either has Brent beside him or looking over his shoulder.<p>This last film by the TNG cast tanked at the box office. Maybe most fans, like myself, just got sick of the filsm always being about Data. Nothing kills a fun time better than an ego.<p>To save this film from a completly abysmal rating, I do give a major plus to Tom Hardy as Shinzon. That boy is talented &amp; I would much rather have preferred screen time going to his character development rather than watching the horribly untalented Brent Spiner sing at Troi's wedding.</p></body></html>

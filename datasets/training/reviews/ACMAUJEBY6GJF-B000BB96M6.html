This meaning, of course, that I don't understand why the critics didn't seem to come up with worthy enough words to praise this new masterpiece signed a certain Tim Burton. At least the critics over here in Europe did, and after finally watching it (with a mixed expectation being that very often critics have no idea what they are talking about -funny how they mostly agree amongst themselves, isn't it? If a movie is weird enough it's a bit scary being the one who doesn't "get it", am I right?).<br /><br />And yes, this movie is weird enough -but it doesn't seem forced, and is not the problem at all. And I don't give a damn about the similarities between Willie Wonka and Michael Jackson! Ironically at first viewing it was like being served a big and tempting bowl of candy -but it didn't taste anything. The gigantic chocolate-factory stands there in all its' mystery containing all its' secrets, but when we're finally inside every room looks the same. It's been a while since I read the book (but I did recognize myself there from time to time), so my dissapointment has got nothing to do wether it is true to the original story or not -but I simply didn't find it amusing, and after finnishing the bowl I still want candy. Ok, enough with the candy -but how this movie has scored full pot with the critics is beyond me. It's ok at its' best, and I can swallow a child loving it of course -it's colorful, and at times like watching a childrens' show. But at the same time it's a comedy for adults as well, and somehow falls between two chairs.<br /><br />I must admit that my two stars on the other hand goes to Johnny Depp. He certainly "becomes" Willie Wonka, or the oposite that is. He was a pleasure to watch -and overall the movie is saved by good acting from the entire cast. It's the story itself I found flat as its' original script -and far, far overrated. It has its' moments I guess, but nothing remembarable. All the praise of amazing effects, well, I didn't notice anything special. And good and "believable" effects aren't everything (or haven't we learned?).<br /><br />Christopher Lee is wasted on a completely non-fit father/son-scenario switching between present/past (similar to other Burton-productions like "Sleepy Hollow" there with the main character and his mother), and is totally unecassarry -and ruined at least a desent ending. Over the top if you ask me! It just didn't make any sence at all -even for an fabled adventure-story...<br /><br />So sorry, Tim Burton, I'm usually a big fan of you -but you can do better than this!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Shrek sadly jumps a shark tank ... "Loooooook Ooooout!!!""></head><body><p>This is where they officially 'jumped the shark' with his production. I remember Mike Myers having to go on tour to promote this film and not only did he seem to cringe trying to explain it or talk about, he very clearly seemed depressed about it.<br /><br />Like so many others have said, the allure of the original film has long since vanished and leaves this current offering from Dreamworks as probably the worst movie they've ever made.<br /><br />Recently, I realized how much my son loved the original Shrek movie when he kept bringing me the DVD case in the afternoon and pointing at the TV wanting to watch it. He laughed during the silly parts, clapped during and after the fight scenes and danced during all the songs. Twenty minutes into the third installment, he turned away, left the room and wanted nothing to do with it. I turned it off and he went back to coloring. About an hour later, out of curiosity, I put the original Shrek back in the DVD and he was stuck to it - once more - clapping, laughing and dancing until the very end where he danced to the 'Swamp Party Karaoke' scene.<br /><br />I guess the message is this: Shrek isn't a played out concept at all. Shrek is very endearing and a lovable character. He always will be. I actually like Donkey the best. But the people in charge of this project forgot who this film was supposed to be targeted at and thus have been left with a real stinker.<br /><br />The sad thing is that we will probably see Shrek 4 sometime soon, and they'll be trying to hammer home more of this adult-driven nonsense.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE DARKER THE BETTER!!"></head><body><p>i give it lots of credit because it's not very often they come out with something like this. it wasn't scary, but it was a thrill and suspenseful as well. the mother and daughter both seemed lost. they have to move on, hopefully to better things, but it's not so. the mother is haunted by her own past, as well as a haunting in her present. she thinks she's losing it, but she feels there's something more. her daughters in the middle, then in the end she pays the ultimate sacrifice for her little girl. now she must become what she onced feared. good plot and nice twist. although personally i wish it would have ended differently. jennifer connelly did a very good job, playing this woman, who thought she had control of her life, but not so.</p></body></html>

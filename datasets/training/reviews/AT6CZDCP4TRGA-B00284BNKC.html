<meta name="summary" content="Like watching a train wreck..."></head><body><p>...only in slow-motion, with lots of MTV-ish intercutting, speeded-up sequences, and a pulsating soundtrack as the carnage unfolds and the blood splatters the lens.<br /><br />Only here the carnage is not only physical but more unbearably, psychological, emotional, spiritual, and sexual.  In a nutshell: onrushing catastrophes at every level.<br /><br />This is one of those films, in the tradition of "Breaking the Waves," where during the first 10 minutes you see very clearly that the main characters---quite sympathetic, unfortunately---are going to be on a fast-accelerating downhill slide for the rest of the movie.  Unlike similar films that chronicle a steady process of chemical-related self-destruction ("Trainspotting" and "Leaving Las Vegas" come to mind), "Requiem for a Dream" will never be accused of "glamorizing" or "romanticizing" substance abuse.  Director Aranofsky seems to take special pains to capture every excruciating torture and suffering that his protagonists undergo---in fact, he even uses film and sound techniques to amplify it and shove our noses into it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the film is fairly bold as art, and probably quite accurate as social documentary, as an aesthetic work it simply is not very enjoyable to watch.  Both "Trainspotting" and "Leaving Las Vegas" had similarly bleak and hopeless storylines, yet managed to tell those stories in creative and interesting ways, rather than just straight-up, visually-enhanced journalistic docudrama...i.e. both were far more enjoyable because they were much more multi-dimensional, their characters were far better developed and far less predictable.  Leto, Connelly, Wayans, and Burstyn are all talented actors and appealing characters but they are barely developed beyond the black holes of their addictions and compulsions; instead they are presented as basically 4 hopeless and helpless lambs about to be tortured and eaten alive before our eyes in myriad ways.<br /><br />About the only truly original and insightful character drama is that played by Ellen Burstyn, in that we are all too rarely shown the more mainstream addictions that is sadly predominant in American society: food, television, and prescription (diet, in this case) meds.  She was the most interesting of the bunch by far, the other 3 leads are all cardboard characters we've seen a million times before, albeit played by very competent actors.<br /><br />This film could've been far more original, interesting, and insightful if it had simply focused on Burnstyn's character as a case study for mainstream America---lobotomized by TV, living isolated miserable lives in a dysfunctional community and culture, bloated by junk food used as pleasure substitutes, getting their fixes from the local pharmacy.<br /><br />Three stars for visual/aural stimulation but shallow and cliched storyline.</p></body></html>

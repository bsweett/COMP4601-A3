That a lot of the orignial movie was left out of this newer version.  So what?  That is the idea of a remake, if you want the same movie, request that the original be remastered and redigitized.  or just watch the version that you like and stop complaining about the travesty of doing it over.  <p>Plus the whole idea of a movie it to make art, but also make money.  I doubt that director or orignal cast of the first movie refused any more than the movie cost or rejected royalties on the basis that they were artists and didn't want sell out.  <p>The original was a classic, but it was made in a different era.  The same things wouldn't work the second time around that worked when the orignal was made.<p>This movie succeded on several levels.  It was gruesome, parts of it were scary, and it was disturbing in a lot of places.  The acting was good, the inbreds in the family and around the town were pleasantly stomach churning, leatherface wasn't overused and stayed relatively fresh up to the end, and the movie had a sweaty grungy feel that helps you feel that you are there.  <p>If you go in this movie with an open mind, you will probably like it.  if you go in with a fanboy attitude and all you want to do is cut it down, you will probably hate it.  There are flaws to be sure, but it is a movie, they are to be expected.</p></body></html>

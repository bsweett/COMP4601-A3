<meta name="summary" content="Nicely done but lightyears away from great. Overhyped too."></head><body><p>I have no idea why this film is being compared to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000ILDD">ALIEN</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">JAWS</a>. It is offensively inferior.<br /><br />Basically, there is a Korean family. Then there is this monster who captures the little girl. Family goes after the monster. Monster keeps the girl in its sewer hideout full of other victim's bones. Family finds the monster. Monster is attracted to the city where there's a trap. Monster gets killed.<br /><br />The effects are nicely done and the crowd scenes where the monster runs at large and eats people are very well staged (and must have been expensive to shoot). That explains why there are only two of those big scenes in the entire film.<br /><br />The rest of the film is just the family looking for the monster and little girl hiding from the monster.<br /><br />The film lacks more spectacle (although the little it has is very well done).<br /><br />And the acting is very strange. It is very histrionic... like if everybody were in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JU8H74">Masked Rider</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IU37TI">Ultraman</a> episode. In a way, it looked like those old Japanese TV shows... but made with CGI.<br /><br />I got very disappointed after all the hype.<br />I am sure it worked a lot better with Asian audiences who are more in tune with many elements... like the histrionic acting, some characters, the fact that one of the protagonists is an Olympic bow and arrow winner (a big sport in Korea)... and many other things.<br /><br />Rent. Don't buy.</p></body></html>

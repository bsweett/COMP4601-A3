<meta name="summary" content=""If There's Anybody Out There..., Please" ~ Lighting Up The Darkness"></head><body><p>Following in the apocalyptic tradition of `The Last Man on Earth' from '64 starring Vincent Price and `The Omega Man' from '71 starring Charlton Heston we now have the '07 release `I Am Legend' starring the always impressive Will Smith in the role of a man faced with the possibility of being the last human being on the face of the Earth.<br /><br />While I reward the film superior marks on the one hand for Will's performance, exceptional production values and the message imbued within the storyline delivered through the music and philosophy of Bob Marley, I also found the film very slow in unfolding. Once the action finally got into full swing and I was getting involved it abruptly ends, leaving me somewhat dissatisfied with the distinct feeling that something is missing.<br /><br />My Rating: `I Am Legend' is definitely worth a watch but I don't think it will stand up well to many repeat viewings; -3 ? Stars-.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fast and gritty"></head><body><p>One of the best American action films in quite a while. The action is fast and gritty. The stunts seldom blow past the limits of near-credibility into the realm of CGI cartoon as so many films do these days. The action careens along at such a clip and the plot is just twisty enough that you can't always see what's coming. Man, I wish Jolie weren't too big a name and too expensive to have joined the Avengers ensemble as Black Widow. She would have been spot-on perfect.</p></body></html>

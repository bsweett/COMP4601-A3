<meta name="summary" content="The Incredibles..."></head><body><p>At first I was really upset with the makers of this story, as the Characters have powers from both Marvel and DC Comics.  But, when I finally saw the movie on cable, I had to admit, I actually liked it, a lot!  Let me lay out their powers:<br /><br />Mr. Incredible:<br /><br />1. Super strength (ala DC Comics Superman, Uncle Sam)<br /><br />Ms. Incredible:<br /><br />1. Streching ability (ala Marvel's Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, DC's Elongated Man)<br /><br />Violet:<br /><br />1. Ability to generate force fields and go invisible (ala Marvel's Sue Richards of the Fantastic Four and Jane Grey of the X-Men)<br /><br />Dash:<br /><br />1. Super Speed (ala DC's Kid Flash)<br /><br />Jack-Jack:<br /><br />1. Morphing Ability (his name escapes me, but I remember the Character "The Element Man" - I believe DC comics).<br /><br />After I got over my "prejudice," I found the movie very well done...they spent a buck (or two) making this feature.  Edna's security system just cracks me up!<br /><br />Finally, Congress should be mandated to watch Mr. Syndrome's character and learn from his dialogue. Particularly the line - "When everyone's Super - no one will be..."  You see we have had Nuclear Weapons advantage over the rest of the world for over fifty years.  That is coming rapidly to an end, as now everyone wants in, whether we approve or not.  So, to repeat:<br /><br />  "When everyone's Super - No one will be"<br /><br />I hope somebody heard what they are trying to say - I did!  Five stars!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not quite 4 stars but close -- a winning comedy"></head><body><p>Here's the movie the Motion Picture Academy overrated and nominated for best picture for 2006, much as it did with "Sideways" a 2004 flick about a pair of middle aged guys travleing through California's wine country a few years earlier. This one is about a dysfunctional family traveling in California too. Think there's a coincidental relationship between the academy nominating each for best picture? Maybe it has something to do with all the electors and voters living in California?<br /><br />As you probably know, this involves a typically dysfunctional family (highly Hollywoodized) that consists of an out of work dad (Greg Kinnear), standup mom that holds it all together (Toni Collette), pervert father that lives with them (Alan Arkin), loser brother that lost his boyfriend and job, tried to commit suicide, and now lives with them (Steve Carell, better known as the "40 Year Old Virgin"), bitter and alienated teenage son (Paul Dano) and the star, Little Miss Sunshine herself, 12-year-old Olive (Abagail Breslin) who wins a local contest and competes for the national title of the named character.<br /><br />The action revolves around the family taking its trip from New Mexico to the pagaent near Los Angeles and the various underlying stories that go on while that's in progress. Every character is a cliche, of course, with the mother being the typical savior that holds it all together. The film is variably hilarious, stupid, insightful, energetic, arousing, perverted and sentimental. You will laugh a lot at and with these characters during their trip to, and arrival at, the Little Miss Sunshine pagaent, where a lot of nonsense breaks out that would only occur in a movie or a Three Stooges routine.<br /><br />If you're like me, you'll wonder why the Motion Picture Academy thought this was one of the five best movies of 2006. Its temperament reminds me a bit of "In America", a movie from 2002 starring a pair of real life sisters that lit up the screen with transcendent performances that bordered on magic. That film didn't have the outright humor of "Little Miss Sunshine" but it was, from my perspective, a far better production and a much better story.<br /><br />This one will leave you feeling good, if that's your goal, and it will entertain you throughout, but it definitely should not have been considered an Oscar contender.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Easily could have been a 3 or 4 with some better execution with the story."></head><body><p>I loved how this movie starts out with the joke to the kid about the doctor, he seemed to be playing his character from Snatch.  This movie actually goes downhill from this point on.  It had some pretty good fight scenes, but Statham takes liek 20 minutes to disbatch like 10 guys.  He's obviously not very fast, but they he could have taken care of the baddies quicker.  And I'm not talking about anything but the action, it would be way too hard to recall the story, I;m already starting o feel sick this of this stupid ass movie again.  I had more fun watching Exit wounds or timecop.</p></body></html>

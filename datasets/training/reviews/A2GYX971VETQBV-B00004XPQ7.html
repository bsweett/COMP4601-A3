The film is not historically accurate; its main character (played by Mel Gibson) is an utterly perfect and flat character that has no visible faults and is somehow able to articulate the ideas of freedom better than the framers of the Constitution; the film is slanted towards the American side, portraying the British in an overtly negative light; the blacks and French are underplayed and stereotyped; etc.  But to conclude that the film has no worth based upon these points is ridiculous.  One must step back from the film and ask, "Was I entertained?  Did the movie hit upon some things that made me think?  Feel?"<p>"The Patriot" is certainly an enjoyable film visually.  The battle scenes are terrific and provide a plenty of visual and emotional interest-an aspect that is surprising with its long pans and relatively slow camera angles.  The scene in which Gibson first "re-enters" his warrior mode and almost single-handedly takes on a British regiment of twenty soldiers has some spectacular hatchet fighting and hand combat choreography.  This scene alone makes the film worth watching for any lover of guerilla tactics or knife fighting/close combat.  On top of the action, the screenplay is quite clever in parts, despite its tendency towards the sentimental.  Mel Gibson's performance seems very much like a continuation of his role in "Braveheart"-one can hardly notice a difference in the characters.  But he plays this part well, the part of a man who alone can save a country from the oppressive enemy.  In the scenes where he deals with the loss of his family his acting is moving and quite believable. <p>There is much to dislike in this picture.  If one is upset by the historical inaccuracies, I ask why they are looking to Hollywood to fill them in on American history.  Writing a film that satisfied all of the points mentioned above would not only be an impossibility-it would be boring and lack any appeal.  This movie tells the story of a man who fights for his family and, in doing this, for a new country and an ideal.  While the love stories seem contrived and thrown in, the love of family, the love of brotherhood and camaraderie, and the incredible action all make this an excellent film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Ten Most Magnificent Films Of All Time!"></head><body><p>No one was a more masterful film maker than was David Lean, the British director who brought us such unforgettable classics as "Bridge Over the River Kwai", "Doctor Zhivago" ""Ryan's Daughter", and of course, "Lawrence  of Arabia"(see my reviews of all these films). The cinematography is always  spectacular and breath-taking, and one has to agree with the comments of a  previous reviewer that here the desert plays a well-scripted supporting  role in the unfolding drama that was T. E. Lawrence's experience during the  First World War in Arabia. Lean always focused his films on the ways in  which individuals and their personal characteristics clash and meld with  the larger social, cultural, and historical surround in which they are  located, and so each film is a particularly captivating study of the  specific dynamics of each such situation. Each of these films is also a  well-choreographed and photographed excursion into the topography, climate,  and landscape of the geographic location in which the drama unfolds. The  eyes and ears are always delighted by what Lean displays. <p>Here young and  bookish Lawrence is faced with the unenviable and unlikely prospect of  trying to unite the multitude of Arab Bedouin tribes in support of the  Allies in the regional warfare associated with WWI. The film captures this  unlikely and somewhat quixotic personal odyssey most memorably, and a very  young Peter O'Toole is masterful in his edgy portrayal of the enigmatic  Lawrence as a time-trapped romantic caught by whimsy and circumstance in  the most mind-boggling adventure of a lifetime, an adventure that broke all  the rules of convention and upper-class British expectations.  <p>He meets  his match with other characters played by Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, and  Sir Alec Guinness. And in capturing the comically mismatched skills,  expectations, and romanticism that Lawrence launched into the larger  picture of what was going on, by viewing his personal odyssey in the  context of the much larger cultural framework of Arab ambitions,  jealousies, and cultural differences, we are magically transported into the  strange and marvelous world of the desert and all the romance and mystery  of that region.  Viewing each of David Lean's splendid and classic films  is a treat and a privilege; no one was as prolific, as consistent, and as  engaging a storyteller as he. Lawrence of Arabia is one of his finest  films, and as such represents a wonderful standard of excellence in  storytelling and film experiences. Sit down and relax, for you are in a  master's hands. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

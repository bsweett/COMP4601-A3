<meta name="summary" content="There is a ghost in her house"></head><body><p>It is rats in the attic or termites in the timbers ( bats in the bell free<br />or bugs in your hat?), but never, never real spirits? Seeing the head doctor<br />and fighting off the men in white coats, people believe in their lonesome fantasy of dead people walking? Is it the neighbor's dead wife or something more sinister? It seems to be a plum role for Michelle Pfeiffer?<br />Harrison Ford is kind of the straight man to the bent housewife<br />with delusions that aren't...MEF and possession.<br />From there things go from bad to worse.<br />Well made, well acted, just not the kind of movie I like.<br />I've watched it twice to make this review.</p></body></html>

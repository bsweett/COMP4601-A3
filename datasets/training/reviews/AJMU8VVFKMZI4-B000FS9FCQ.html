This is a descent movie, however, I think the concept and the story is better suited for graphic novel medium and doesn't translate as poignantly as a film.  Film, books and music are often warning us to mindful of our goverment and how easily we can slip into a totalitarian rule.  Fear is a very real weapon most goverments have already learned to weld to shrink civil rights in the name of national secruity.  Yet as a film, this one is missing some things.  I never truely contected with V.  There are a few scene when he comes off looking rather silly (cooking-kissing).  Weaving, likely a strong actor with a very theatrical voice, the mask was too cold a shield for an audience to connect to.  At the very least I would have liked to see his eyes.  Something for him to become more real to me.  Portman's character could have just as easily been taken out.  I know what she was suppose to symbolize, but, eh, I wanted her to be more involved in the revolution and I guess I wanted a bigger revolution than what was delivered on screen.  Again, it's a good film, just not a great one.</p></body></html>

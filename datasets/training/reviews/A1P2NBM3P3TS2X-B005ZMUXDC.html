The forty-four year-old me was completely delighted by this film and I look forward to watching it many times over.<br /><br />The movie is available in various digital media formats and with various bonus features depending on your purchase choice.  But all of that is secondary --  if it isn't a good movie, ultimately the bonus features are empty and don't matter.  "Tangled" IS a good movie and worthy of adding to your library.  Young and old will both find it charming, funny, and delightful.<br /><br />As a fan of all things Broadway, I was extra pleased to hear that Broadway veteran Donna Murphy was featured in this.  She is a great actress with a tremendous singing voice.  She brings a lot to her villainous role in "Tangled" and lends the requisite amount of dramatic weight to the proceedings.<br /><br />This movie ain't just for kids, folks.</p></body></html>

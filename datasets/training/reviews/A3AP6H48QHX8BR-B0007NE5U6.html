<meta name="summary" content="Bridget's Back!!!!!---I Like This Movie Just The Way It Is!"></head><body><p>After reading the reviews online I was a little hestitant about seeing the movie afterall, it's common sense that the sequel to any good movie never really turns out the way you want it too... but, in this case I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is what fans of Bridget have waited for-<br /><br />What happens after happily ever after we all wonder when we see the end to any movie and in this one we get the chance to see a piece of what becomes between the buff Bridget and her "perfect" boyfriend Mark-- who folds his underwear before he goes to sleep. In this reality strikes their relationship as Bridget and Mark deal with snobby/single friends, lesbian kisses, Thai prisons, break-ups, family, weekends spent away together, and work-- also a beautiful young secretary with long legs who happens to work with Mark. Of course, as in any squel there is a comeback by Daniel Cleaver who everywhere Bridget turns manages to see his face as he has just landed himself his own television show and is the same as ever-- and still going after Bridget. Can Bridget and Mark manage to survie??? Well I think we all know the answer to that.<br /><br />Colin Firth is more charming in this as Mark Darcy than he was in the first and of course, Renee does a wonderful job as the buff Brit who never seems to get anything right. Hugh Grant is davishly evil and once again you see that wonderful on-screen rivalry between Hugh and Firth.<br /><br />This was the film I have been waiting for after seeing the words "the beginning" in Bridget Jone's Diary... and I loved seeing Bridg and Mark together. I found myself swooning after Mark who likes Bridget-- "likes her just the way she is"--wobbly bits included... what girl dosn't want a man like Mark? And Bridget maintains to be the symbol of all woman- slightly overweight and wanting wedding bells to dong.<br /><br />This is a movie for fans and a must see for any Colin Firth or Hugh Grant fan. All in all rent this one or do what I'm doing and buy this one!</p></body></html>

So from Sweden to South Korea I went this weekend, and my friend was right, Old Boy was quite good. (But I think that I've filled my quota for subtitled movies for the year.)<br /><br />While a little over the top and bizarre at times, Old Boy is one of the more original and diabolical stories that I've seen in a while. Your name is Dae-su and you've been kidnapped off the streets one day to find yourself locked in a room with no explanation for why you're being held captive. No one communicates with you other than a TV set that has been placed in the room and your only contact with anyone is a daily serving of dumplings pushed through a small opening in the locked door. Now imagine that several years of this pass and there's still no explanation for your captivity.<br /><br />Would you go nuts? Or would you spend every day wishing and preparing for release so that you could exact revenge on your captors? Be careful what you wish for, because being locked in a room for the rest of your life could turn out to be a better option if your captor releases you and your imprisonment was only the beginning of your torment. "Laugh, and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you weep alone." Baloney! Ask Dae-su how he feels about that inspirational poster.<br /><br />Old Boy is darkly amusing at times, but mostly genuinely disturbing. Importantly, it was thoroughly entertaining. It had enough action and the twists and turns came frequently enough to prevent any boredom. Definitely worth reading 2 hours of subtitles.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Good Film"></head><body><p>I liked most parts of "Slumdog Millionaire."  There were many standout moments, from the exceptional final twenty minutes, to Jamal's hilarious plunge into the feces, to pretty much any of the scenes on the set of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire."  The film's structure in non-linear, and it really works for the movie, allowing Jamal's answers to the "Millionaire" questions to be the catalyst for the film to flash back to the earlier days of his life, eventually blurring the line between the two stories as Jamal's past catches up to his present.<br /><br />At one hundred and twenty minutes, I did feel that the film was a bit bloated in parts.  The sections at the police station were clearly used to show how different the legal system works where Jamal lives, but too much time was spent there, and I did feel that it took away from the overall impact of the film.  There were parts that felt like they dragged on and on, and I think the film would have come closer to deserving the critical acclaim if it had been a bit more focused, especially in the middle.  The beginning was good, though, and the fantastic end was enough to get the movie back on track.  The only other thing I could fault the movie for is that the screenplay didn't really make the transition of Jamal's feelings about Latika feel organic.  Instead of assuming that the audience would buy Jamal's love for her developing from close friend/almost family to love of his life, I think a bit of time might have been spent on filling in that gap, so the story arc from beginning to end would flow a bit better.<br /><br />In the end, it's a good film that keeps you on your toes with its structure.  It might make you cry, it might make you laugh, it might make you cringe, and it will definitely make you think.  The relationship between Jamal and his brother Salim was developed so exceptionally, on both the writing and acting front.  It's a movie that has many great things about it, but I'm not sure that I found it as stunningly brilliant as a lot of other filmgoers did.  I think it's certainly the most overrated film of the year, but that's only because folks seem to think this movie is the second coming of film.  In the end, I found "Slumdog Millionaire" to be a good movie that had some problems along the way but rectified them with a superb end.<br /><br />7/10</p></body></html>

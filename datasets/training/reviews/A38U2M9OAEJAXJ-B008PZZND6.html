But the truth is, "Brokeback Mountain" is an emotionally charged love story directed with maturity, elegance, and grace by Ang Lee.  Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play two men (Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist) who get a gig as shepherds at (where else?) Brokeback Mountain (based in Wyoming but filmed in Alberta).  Their working relationship morphs into a friendship, which takes an intimate turn when Ennis and Jack have a tryst on one cold night.  They swear it's a one-time thing, but in reality, they try to carry on a twenty-year affair unbeknownst to the wives they eventually marry (Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway).  The beauty of "Brokeback" is that it doesn't take sides or cast judgement.  Ang Lee lets you feel each of the character's pain, frustration and anxiety.  We sympathize with Jack's longing, and we witness Ennis struggling to balance both a family and the man he so desires.  We also ache with Ennis' wife Alma (Williams), who can't even begin to grasp the words to describe what she sees when she catches her husband kissing another man from her window.  For her, it seems, homosexuality is completely outside her realm of understanding.  But "Brokeback" wouldn't stand tall without its performances, which are collectively outstanding.  What's also remarkable is how the screenwriters took the 40-odd-page short story (written by Annie Proux) and stretched it to a movie that runs for over two hours.  Rush-released shortly after the Oscars, this DVD somewhat skimps on the extras (no director's commentary, for instance).  Still, "Brokeback Mountain" is a beautifully told movie than lingers in your head long after the final credits roll.</p></body></html>

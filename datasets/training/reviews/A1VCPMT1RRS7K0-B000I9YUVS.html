<meta name="summary" content="Foggy memories of a poor film effort"></head><body><p>The movie opens with a fairly boring beginning.  Things don't look too promising- and they don't get any better throughout.<br /><br />I would liken the film more to a Murder She Wrote episode than a horror/thriller movie.  The acting is a bit on the weak side and it's very difficult to maintain interest in the story.  As another reviewer said, it's "just plan bad".  There is nothing frightening about it and it will leave you questioning why they even decided to remake the movie in the first place.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mary Shaw asks...now who's the dummy?"></head><body><p>I am not a big fan of the malevolent doll subgenre in horror, but respecting talents of James Wan and Leigh Whannell, I gave Dead Silence (2007) a try.  While this film didn't change my feelings about dolls, puppets, or dummies, this was an entertaining and atmospheric tale, with a wicked twist at the conclusion.  Wan and Whannell, creators of the Saw series, turned that project over to others, so they could work on Dead Silence.  Characterized by some as a throwback to a gothic style of storytelling, perhaps this was not the time for resurgence in puppet horror, as the film tanked at the box office.  Despite there being no Sawesque gore, I still recommend the film to those who appreciate their PG-13 horror with a little ghostly element.<br /><br />Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) and his wife Lisa (Laura Regan) receive a strange looking ventriloquist puppet as a gift.  While Jamie is out of the house, Lisa is mysteriously killed, her tongue removed, and her body left looking like a grotesque doll.  Police Detective Jim Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg) suspects Jamie of being involved, but has no proof.  Jamie returns to his home town of Ravens Fair, to bury his wife.  He also visits his estranged father Edward (Bob Gunton), and discovers that he has remarried, and suffered a stroke.  Now confined to a wheelchair, his needs are attended to by his wife Ella (Amber Valletta).<br /><br />Jamie eventually learns about Mary Shaw, a famous ventriloquist, who during a performance, was heckled by a small boy named Michael Ashen.  Shortly thereafter, Michael mysteriously disappeared.  The Ashen family, and others in the town, cut out Mary Shaw's tongue before killing her.  As time passed, Mary began to exact her revenge, as the people responsible began to die, their bodies found with their tongues cut out.  Now Ravens Fair has practically become a ghost town.  With Lisa's death the last in a long line of similar killings, Jamie may be the next on the list.<br /><br />The family curse is a device with a long tradition in horror, and the setup here is rather traditional, with the innocent hero poking around and then discovering its existence.  The ghostly Mary Shaw is creepy, but with her major weapon being her huge grotesque tongue, what she can do is rather limited.  Dead Silence heavily relies on darkness and a heavy atmosphere, to setup the scares, as it's a little short on action and gore.  The acting performances are generally solid.  Ryan Kwanten is understated and effective, as his character uncovers the truth in a calm and rational way.  Detective Lipton is guy who just has a lot of time on his hands, leaving his jurisdiction to pursue what is a nebulous case.  Bob Gunton, Amber Valetta, and Michael Fairman as the mortician, don't have much screen time, but are all quite effective in crucial roles.<br /><br />For their most personal projects, Leigh Whannell and James Wan and have steered away from the gory extremes that the Saw films have inspired.  Dead Silence is a creepy atmospheric ghost story that provides some thrills, while building up to a climactic finish.  The film's big twist plays out pretty well, as Mary Shaw accomplishes her goal of creating the perfect dummy.  The plot has some holes, but is generally well crafted, and effectively creates a creepy atmosphere, however a little more action might have helped perk it up a bit.  Rating 3.5 stars, this one is a bit of a tweener.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ID4: Special Edition DVD -- WOW!"></head><body><p>I just got this dvd and finally got through all the materials included on this dvd, and all I have to say is wow! There is so much packed into 2 discs its crazy. First off, I really love this movie to begin with, so this  set is for any ID4 fan. On disc one there is a special edition of this  movie with about 9 minutes of additional footage, although it actually  seems like a lot less. Nothing major added, just some addition to add to  the scene development. It also has the original theatrical release on disc  one if you want to watch that. The second disc is packed with suppliments.  My favorite was seeing an alternate ending using the biplane, it was quite  funny and i'm a little surprised they didnt stick with that one. There is  also a neat hidden easter egg on this disc which most people will likely  miss. Goto the Data Console, then highlight main menu, then press the right  arrow key to highlight the red LED on the computer and press enter. The  spaceship in the background will start to move, once it lets you, quickly  go back to the main menu and press 7 then 4 and enter and it will kick you  inside the ship where it has a lot of cool extra features.<p>All in all  this is a great dvd, the 3d menus are very similar to The Abyss SE Dvd,  which i also loved. If you own a dvd player, get this now! :)</p></body></html>

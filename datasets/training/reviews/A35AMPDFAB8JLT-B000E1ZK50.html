<meta name="summary" content="Tongue in cheek tribute to the horror classics"></head><body><p>I think Stephen Sommers ("The Mummy", "The Mummy Returns") had fun making this film. This tongue in cheek tribute to the classic horror films from the 1930's and 1940's is a thrilling ride with an amazing sequence of visuals. There are many outstanding scenes, such as Dracula's lair with the frozen ice sickles hanging from the ceiling and furniture, to the marvelously dark scenes of the Dracula castle high up in the craggy mountain ranges, to the splendor of the Fellini like ballroom scene inside a Cathedral with its motley group of guests. Perhaps we could have done without the initial battle between Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) and the grotesquely huge, cigar smoking, Mr. Hyde, but once we get beyond this point the film is charmingly engaging as we move from one visual spectacle into the next as Van Helsing and Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), and the friar, Carl(David Wenham), battle the likes of Dracula, the Werewolf, and the Frankenstein monster. This movie was created with the energy and spirit of movies like "The Mummy" or the "Pirates of the Caribbean".  Pop up some popcorn and then just sit back and enjoy this roller coaster ride!</p></body></html>

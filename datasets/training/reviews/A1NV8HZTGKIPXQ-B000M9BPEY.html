The macabe genius has slipped up here lately with his re-make of "Planet Of The Apes", but the man is back and in a big way. Burton has always been able to take his audience on an incredible journey into the minds of oddball characters(Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood) and into the presence of magical worlds and fairy tales. Never has he done so with such brilliance as he has with this latest offering. The movie is about Edward Bloom, a man who is seen young(played by Ewan McGregor), and as his older present day self(played by Albert Finney). Edward is not long for this world, and his estranged son Will(Billy Crudup), comes back home with his expecting wife, to see his father and patch things up before it's too late. Will has always been hearing his father's wild tall tales, and has had enough. He wants the truth. He wants to know the man that his father really is before the man himself is no more. From his bed, Edward Sr. talks with his son and the discussion takes us through the life and journeys he has been in. Young Edward is seen as a young man with ambition and determination with a lot left over to spare. He is seen journeying through the world into haunted woods, enchanting towns, working in a traveling circus, and coming across people such as a giant, witches, werewolves, and other interesting characters. Will tries to get to the bottom of these tall tales that his father has been telling and claiming are as true as they can be. It's a son hoping to reconcile with the man, the father, that he never really knew. This is like "Forrest Gump", but in a way that only Tim Burton could tell it. The story and screenplay is solid and laced with delicate writing, settings, and colorful characterizations. The fact that this wonderful film was so overlooked during 'Awards' time was downright criminal. Burton's girlfriend, Helena Bonham Carter, appears in the film, as does Burton regular, Danny DeVito, who plays a circus ringleader. Jessica Lange plays Edward's wife in present day, Sandra, and that character is played in the past by Alison Lohman. Jessica is such a fine actress, and it's too bad she wasn't given more to do. They did a fine job of getting the two actresses to play the same character. Crudup is a fine young actor and he does a solid job as the confused son searching for answers. Who wouldn't be in his place?. Who would believe the stories, or some of them, would be true?. Every frame is flawlessly choreographed, and the sets and art direction are magical, clear, colorful, and have a very serene feel. This is definitley Burton's masterpiece. It is a film that seems more human than anything he has done. The acting is sincere. Ewan brings an enthusiasm and down home charm to his role as the younger Edward, and he is enigmatic throughout. You are instantly charmed and even though you already know how he turns out, you root for him and wish him the best on his journey in life. Albert Finney does a fine job as the older, ailing Edward. He comes across as a very likeable old man who just embraces life. That's what the film is. Embrace life. Live it to it's fullest. One other review stated that Finney was unpleasant. I find that so untrue. This is pure gold. I haven't been this enchanted with a film in a long time. Thank you Tim Burton. Can't wait for the next one.</p></body></html>

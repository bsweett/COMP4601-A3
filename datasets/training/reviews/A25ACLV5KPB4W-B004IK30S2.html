<meta name="summary" content="A fistful of gags"></head><body><p>Will Ferrell's first big comedy after Elf won't rake in the dollars that his holiday heartwarmer did, nor is it likely to go over as well with critics, who were able to forgive Elf's schmaltzy ending due to the imaginative gags. Anchorman is a pretty funny comedy, although there is nothing much to occupy our minds as we wait for the next funny joke. The movie takes a shotgun approach, spraying us liberally with jokes to see what sticks, and enough did that I was happy walking out of the theater. The storyline is pretty simple-Ron Burgundy is a bigshot local tv anchorman in the seventies, who is so entrenched in the way that things are that he can't even conceive of an aspiring female anchor as a threat. He quickly falls in love with said aspirant Applegate, but they break up as soon as her encroachment on his professional turf is too much to ignore. Happy ending, blah blah blah.</p></body></html>

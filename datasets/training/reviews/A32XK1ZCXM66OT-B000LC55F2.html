Which seems normal enough at first. But when one of the magicians comes up with a trick called "The Teleported Man" and the trick becomes a hit. It forces the other magician into an obsessive quest to figure out how the trick is done. Which drives him to do some pretty dangerous and deadly things to destroy the other magician.</p></body></html>

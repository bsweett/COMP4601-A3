<meta name="summary" content="gore galore"></head><body><p>*Saw III* is gore galore!  You're going to see broken bones, ripped flesh, twisted flesh and bones and many more.  You'll even see decaying pigs turned into liquid. This film is definitely not for the squeamish.  I had to look away from the screen a few times.  The crime scenes you seen in CSI are G-rated compared to what you'll see here.  As a warning, don't eat while you're watching this film because you'll definitely lose your appetite.<br /><br />Jigsaw is at it again...except that he is dying.  Once again, Amanda (the sole survivor of Jigsaw's games from the first film) joins Jigsaw.  In this film, you'll see just how much Amanda is involved and why she holds Jigsaw dear.<br /><br />A doctor has been kidnapped to keep Jigsaw alive.  As long as Jigsaw is alive, she'll stay alive.  If he dies, she dies as well.  Meanwhile, a man has been kidnapped and is going through a game.  This man lost a son to a drunk driver and has since been obsessed with vengenance.  In this tailored game, he has to decide whether to forgive certain people or let them die in their own games.<br /><br />As I said before, Jigsaw is dying.  Amanda is emotionally unstable.  The doctor does everything to keep Jigsaw alive.  The grieving father is advancing towards his freedom.  Just who makes it out alive?  Who dies?  Just like the first and second movies, there's a twist.  The twist is so good that you won't believe you didn't think of it before.<br /><br />*Saw III* is a good movie that is just overloaded with gory stuff.  They make be fake but still, they can make you really squirm in your seats.</p></body></html>

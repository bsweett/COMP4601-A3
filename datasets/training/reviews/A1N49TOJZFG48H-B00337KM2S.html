<meta name="summary" content="along with the hurt locker another perfect film from 2009"></head><body><p>you'll read from much better writers than myself state why you ought or ought not to consider this film for a rental and/or ownership . i was not always taken with George's films . i disliked the smirking , we're to sexy for these pictures (the Oceans films) beyond the 1st which i rather liked . additionally i'm not really smitten with political films . gradually Mr. Clooney began to win me over for a number of projects and reasons though . i saw him in Syriana and was impressed (even though it was a political Film) . when next i chose to see him it was at my parents urging in the flawed (at the end) but largely excellent Michael Clayton . those films and the acclaim heaped on this picture made me go all in and rent it . i'm glad i did . i feel it's his most mature and best work to date . the entire cast is outstanding . its young writer/director is obviously no slouch . being related to the jazz songbird Rosemary Clooney did not hurt either . modern film for smart people . hope you like it .</p></body></html>

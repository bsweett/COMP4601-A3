<meta name="summary" content="Excellent performances all around..."></head><body><p>Very powerful true story, starring two excellent performances from Forest Whitacker and James McAvoy, as a doctor who travels to Uganda and becomes the personal assistant to the president, who is a brutal tyrant and a ruthless murderer. For Whitacker, this is the role that will be remembered for years to come. At once awkwardly friendly, then vicious at the drop of a hat, he creates a character that is so authentically realized, you forget that he is delivering a performance. SEE IT.</p></body></html>

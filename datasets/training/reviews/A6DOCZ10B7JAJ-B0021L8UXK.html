<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant Romero script finally gets studio support"></head><body><p>t took nearly four decades, but finally Hollywood threw The Crazies a bone.  With a budget of 20 million (compared to the meager $275,000 in the original), this remake gnaws on some more fleshed-out ideas than the early 70's gem could offer.  It injects a very believable threat while exposing a provocative element of fear.  Although far from perfect, this doomsday thriller is nicely shot and unleashes some horrific moments upon the audience.<br /><br />Although the virus outbreak dilemma has spread through countless movies over the years, few have the same sort of tense, spine-shattering images and predicaments.  Like American soldiers blindly obeying orders to kill.  Crowds being quarantined and transported like cattle.  Suspicions arising and distrust rampant amongst the entire town.  Just mass chaos as all lingering hope is brutally crushed.  This has some great kill scenes, like impalement by pitchfork, flesh-burning by blowtorch, and the threat of a circular saw.  Probably not for the squeamish.<br /><br />Unfortunately this movie eventually suffers from the typical Hollywood infection.  Hard to ward that off in a big budget release.  Nothing too preposterous I guess, just the normal last-second bravado that seems highly unlikely.  There are some other minor plot holes littered here and there.  Slightly irritating, but not too bad.<br /><br />Highly recommended to the casual horror fan.  Plus you Crazies will probably enjoy it.</p></body></html>

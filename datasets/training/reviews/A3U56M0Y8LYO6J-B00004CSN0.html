It is filled with so many characters and story arcs that its scale is overwhelming at times. Thankfully, the two central actors in the film are such strong anchors that they manage to keep you from losing your focus while watching this grand tale unfold before your eyes. The two actors are the twin living legends of cinema - Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro. <p>Los Angeles police detective Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is handed the job of tracking down a team of professional thieves. They are led by a clever ex-con named Neil McCauley (De Niro) who is as cool as he is calculating. McCauley lives by a strict code of conduct that demands that he be disciplined enough to walk away from anything in his life if the heat is on. When a loose end from an earlier heist interferes with his enjoying the spoils of a subsequent heist, McCauley finds out if he really can carry out this dictate. If he can, then he will be able to start a new life for himself. If he cannot, then Hanna will bring to an end his obsession with McCauley by finally catching his prey.<p>Most of the attention this film received was due to the presence of its two leads. Pacino and DeNiro certainly do not disappoint and their discussion in the coffee shop is certainly the highlight of the film. Yet, the performances of the supporting cast should also be noted. Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, and Ashley Judd turn in great performances and manage not to be overwhelmed by all the machismo around them. Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, and Tom Sizemore also enhance the film with the presence. Kilmer is particularly strong in his role and his relationship with Judd is the most touching of the male-female story arcs in the film. <p>Michael Mann once again manages to achieve the proper balance of substance and style in a feature film. "Heat" has an authentic feel and a sense of realism that elevates it above its clich&eacute;-filled brethrens. There are some issues with the film that hinder matters - the Natalie Portman arc is underdeveloped, the Waingro character should have had more of a presence, and the film's pacing drags at spots. Yet, "Heat" is still a solid film that is well worth watching. In a closing note, I'd like to recommend reading Nick James' analysis of "Heat" from the "BFI Modern Classics" book series. The book is a solid critique that will open your eyes to facets of the film not considered before.</p></body></html>

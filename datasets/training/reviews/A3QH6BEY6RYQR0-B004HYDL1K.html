<meta name="summary" content="A rockin' good time"></head><body><p>Robert Rodriguez brings to the screen a violent, funny, over-the-top story of a former Mexican Federale, known as Machete,  who is hired to assassinate a Texas political figure.  The assassination is a set-up, and Machete must find out who is behind it, while at the same time looking at self-preservation. Machete encounters two strong female characters. One is an ICE agent, the other has an operation assisting illegal immigrants, but she poses as a seller of burritos. These two women provide valuable assistance to Machete in his quest to keep himself alive while hunting down the bad guys. The film also contains caricatures of border hawk sheriffs and political figures. The graphic violence is lightened by dark humor that keeps the audience laughing, even while heads are chopped off.</p></body></html>

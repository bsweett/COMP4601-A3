<meta name="summary" content="The Key: The Chief Inspector and the Spectator are ONE"></head><body><p>From the very beginnings of cinema, especially with the turn-of-the-century movies of the great French magician, Georges Melies, film has been the ultimate illusion.  It's the amateur spectator who perceives the movies as a "documentation of reality." Orson Welles, for one, knew better, saying "Film is a ribbon of dreams."  And as the illusionist tells his agitated admirers out in the streets: "Everything you've seen is an illusion, a trick. Go home and don't be upset."<br /><br />Accordingly, the first step toward the full appreciation of film is to see every great movie as a "construct" of the director, not as a "record of reality."  The Chief Inspector (Paul Giamatti) is the ideal spectator.  In his first confrontation with the Illusionist, he is allowed to see through Illusionist's illusion to the cause-effect logic behind the deception (identifying the behind-the-back hand that holds an object).  He, like the spectator, has seen a deception exposed, though something in us simultaneously wishes to believe in the magic.  As he tells the Illusionist (Edward Norton) during their final conversation, "I don't know whether you actually bring these people back from the 'other side' or are playing some great trick on us.  But I do know that you're special." Alfred Hitchcock may not have put Gary Grant on the face of Mt. Rushmore, but we nonetheless believe whole-heartedly in the director's sleight of hand even as we appreciate and applaud his inventiveness.<br /><br />But then we reach the final scene of the film and not only witness but participate in an ever-crescendoing epiphany of joy, one which we share with the Chief Inspector, as he (along with the spectator) finally puts the pieces together: he figures out the illusion. It's ironic that many experienced filmgoers can become so savvy about special effects and complain that the "blood didn't look real," etc., yet fail in this instance to be in step with let alone ahead of the Inspector.  Yet the film presents us not with "real" scenery and backgrounds but with painting after painting, fabrication after fabrication. We should have known all along (but the movie wouldn't have been better for it).<br /><br />No matter that the film is an adult "fairy tale" in which everything ends "happily ever after": we believe in it all the more strongly once we're able to discover that it is such a tale.  Or, to invoke a poet (Coleridge) from before the age of cinema, the film celebrates movies as the ultimate "suspension of disbelief."<br /><br />This movie is as smart as they come--made for intelligent viewers who have had their fill of inferior formulaic and "family" film fare.  Not that the film's cleverness and sophistication should limit the size, or mitigate the pleasure, of its audience.  For a change, the spectator has an opportunity to have it both ways: to quote our poet once again, he can emerge a "wiser man"--but without being sadder.<br /><br />[The Blu-Ray version did not strike me as having stunning clarity lacking in the standard version.  But perhaps upon watching the film a 2nd time in Blu-Ray, the spectator who was "tricked" the first time, will be more alert to the fabrications employed in the filmmaking process.]</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A bad movie that starts out great and then degenerates"></head><body><p>This movie starts out with some great promise, yet quickly degenerates into absurdities once the military team makes their journey. The premise is that the ancient Egyptian society that built the pyramids was based on a sophisticated space traveler that needed a host for his failing alien body and found one on Earth. This became the basis for the Egyptian sun god Ra and the reason for the construction of the pyramids.<br /> For reasons that are unexplained, "Ra" left a powerful device in the Egyptian desert that, with a companion device light years away, form a star gate where materials could be transported in a manner of seconds.  Professor Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is an expert on ancient Egypt and his theories of alien assistance in building the pyramids are ridiculed.<br /> However, there is one person that takes him seriously and she asks for his assistance, so Daniel goes to a secret Air Force Facility where the Earth side of the star gate resides. Daniel is able to decipher the markings on the device so that it can be used and Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) leads a military team with Daniel through the star gate to another world. Daniel's role is to decipher the symbols at the other location so that the team can return.<br /> Once the team arrives on the other planet, the plot falls apart. The first unweaving is when Daniel admits that he cannot immediately decipher the return-gate. Some of the soldiers in the team push him around and even throw away his suitcase containing his books. Given that Daniel and his knowledge base is their only hope in returning to Earth this was stupid. To have been selected for such a mission, the soldiers would have been the elite forces, selected for their sturdy mental construction and discipline, surely not ones to push their salvation around.<br />  After some exploring of the planet, the team discovers a large group of humans living in primitive conditions and building a pyramid. The plot is further complicated when Ra returns to the planet to exact revenge and wants to send a nuclear bomb back through the star gate to destroy Earth. That bomb has conveniently been provided by the military team. Why a creature with such a powerful space ship would need that tactical nuclear weapon to exact revenge on Earth is one of many foolish plot premises left unexplained.<br /> There is also a love interest between Daniel and a native woman that leads to an ending that screamed "Sequel!" Apparently there were plans to make one but they were unachieved, which is not such a bad thing. This movie is awful, often very simplistic for a story based on powerful and sophisticated space travelers.</p></body></html>

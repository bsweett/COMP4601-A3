<meta name="summary" content="Amadeus brilliantly restored in Blu-Ray!!"></head><body><p>Looks like I should have waited since now this Blu-ray edition of this Oscar winner is now $14.99 instead of $26.99 which I paid about a week and half ago!!  That's even cheaper than what Best buy advertised.  Anyway I found this edition to boast better chroma and sound than the version HD Net broadcasted.  A plus definitely is the CD of Mozart selections by Neville Mariner.  As for Digital Copy, I didn't find the image on computer to be much worse than it would be on Standard Def.  Anyway if you love this film like I do and am a music lover--I do recommend this film along with the Godfather trilogy in Blu-Ray as well.</p></body></html>

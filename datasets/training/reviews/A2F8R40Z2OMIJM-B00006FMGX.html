<meta name="summary" content="Catch It If You Can"></head><body><p>I love the title sequence of CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (by Kuntzel + Deygas).  The zippy graphics and John Williams score set the scene for what is to come: a stylish chase movie.<p>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale Jr., who, in real life, masqueraded as a pilot, lawyer, and swindled millions.  Tom Hanks is Carl Hanratty (what a name!), the FBI agent who chased Abagnale.<p>As directed by Steven Spielberg, CMIYC is a very entertaining film.  It's well paced, funny, and moving at times.<p>My one complaint about the DVD is that Janusz Kaminski's cinematography gets mucked up in the transfer to digital.  On my widescreen digital TV and proscan DVD player, there are some digital problems in low light scenes with streams of light in the background.  You can see digital artifacts floating in the light beams, which ends up looking like a STAR TREK transporter effect! Otherwise, the disc (especially the sound mix) is a treat.<p>I missed CMIYC in the theaters.  I'm glad I finally 'caught it' on DVD.</p></body></html>

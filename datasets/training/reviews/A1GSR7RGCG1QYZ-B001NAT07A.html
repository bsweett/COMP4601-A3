I think the biggest hurdle that most of us had to overcome in this film was that Catwoman was not Michelle Pfeiffer.  Most of us are still a generation of Batman Returns fans, as well as Tim Burton's darkness, and Halle just couldn't fit those shoes.  Pfeiffer gave us this unbridled performance as this tormented woman who is given a rebirth by some cats, while Berry continually felt as if she was just going through the motions in order to try to be cooler than Pfeiffer was.  You could see the competition going on in the film, and it hurt the overall story and characters.  I will agree, this film had a very weak plot, but with the right person behind the mask of Catwoman, this could have been a decent film.  Sadly, Berry just didn't put the force into it that I felt Pfeiffer did.  There wasn't enough passion in the eyes, just this uncanny ability to act like a cat.  Catwoman was more than "just a cat", she was this troubled soul that had to deal with both the good side of her actions as well as the devilish.  That is what never came through with Berry.<br /><br />Outside of the complete miscast of Halle Berry, there were a couple other points that I just felt cheated after watching the film.  The scene where the cat breaths on Halle was too eerily like Ralph Wiggum's "My cat's breath smells like cat food" moment.  I kept waiting to hear that whenever possible.  It would have granted this film one additional star more.  Sadly, we had to live with what was in this film, and not what wasn't.  What was in this film was shoddy acting, a very flimsy script, and scenario after scenario that just didn't seem to work.  I realize the Pitof (the director) was trying to show a very feminine film that could be seen as a feminist picture, but to me it just didn't work.  All of the sudden this cat brings out what Patience couldn't in the past?  Suddenly, with the quick breath of a cat, she could play basketball better than ever, crack a whip, and drive a motorcycle.  There was no development here, just plain assumption.  I needed more development of this character instead of just this light-speed characterization that lead nowhere.<br /><br />Another element that didn't brood well with me were the villains.  Who were they?  What was their purpose behind their situations?  Without giving us any of this information, we can only assume that they really weren't evil and that perhaps Catwoman was caught up in this big misunderstanding?  I know that is far fetched, but honestly Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson were not that sinister.  Sure, every company that you work for has that boss that is not going to treat you with the greatest of respect, but does that make him the super-villain?  Then you have Sharon Stone with this pathetic super power that works and doesn't work half the time.  I just didn't care at this point what Catwoman was to do to stop the corporation.  It was this huge dilemma that I could have solved quickly by perhaps incorporating something about the Umbrella Corporation and a tie into Resident Evil 3.  Anything could have been better than what Pitof presented here.<br /><br />The themes were also as jumbled as a child's playroom.  Scattered throughout this picture you had different themes that never quite tied into the big solution.  There were the feminist issues, the skin care/growing old is "ok" theme, the dual personalities and to live life to the fullest moments, and then there was the pro-self sidesteps that just never took us anywhere.  It was like bobbing for themes in this mess.  Nearly every five minutes, Pitof would present to us either a new theme or an older one that should have been dropped, but instead found itself back in the picture.  It became increasingly clear with these scattered themes why Berry couldn't quite capture her character.  There were supposed to be several layers to her character, but instead with all the layers everywhere except on Berry, it became increasingly more difficult to uncover.  This caused both problems for the film itself as well as for the audience forced to sit through this mess.  I mean who wants to visit a place of rest and have to clean up before being able to enjoy it.  Not me, and that is how I felt with this film.  I felt that it was this huge mess that Pitof created and wanted me to clean up.  It was pathetic.<br /><br />Overall, I was not happy with this film.  Either Pfeiffer should have been in it or it should have been shelved.  With the growing business behind superheroes in today's cinema, Hollywood studios will have to pick and choose which ones they think will be big.  You cannot release them all, and it proves with the attempt to capitalize on this small hero that ultimately failed.  I hate to go with the rest of the critics with this one, but I just did not enjoy the final result.  The costume, the style, the themes, and the acting all put a hinder on this film that was unrepairable from the beginning.  This is a perfect example of a film that should have been scrapped from the beginning instead of rushed to theaters.  Procrastination does not pay off in the long run!<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I expected silly / dumb, but it was well done."></head><body><p>1.  I like Steve Carrell, but just based on the trailers, I thought this movie was going to be a little too silly or dumb in its humor.<br /><br />2.  Bottomline:  a great cast of characters, well acted, good story line and smart / funny humor.  Well done.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Highly-Charged Thriller"></head><body><p>In the span of 75 minutes, the directors of "Phonebooth" have packed a ton of fast-paced psychological suspense that will be sure to glue audiences to the screen.  Colin Farrell gives a superior performance as Stu Shepard, a sleazy publicist for struggling actors.  Stu decides to use a phonebooth to make a call and his life changes forever.  While in the booth, the phone rings, Stu answers, and he soon discovers that a psychopath with a high-powered rifle is on the other end.  Soon, Stu is begging for his life as the caller (Kiefer Sutherland) asks Stu to answer questions about his infidelity to his wife Kelly, played by Radha Mitchell, his infatuation with Pamela McFadden (Katie Holmes), a young actress he has become involved with, and also bearing his soul to other things as well.<p>Meanwhile, a group of hookers try to get Stu out of the phonebooth, but he won't leave.  Finally, the pimp comes over to try, but he ends up getting shot by the caller.  Instantly, the hookers think that Stu is the shooter, and soon the phonebooth is surrounded by police and SWAT team members.  Captain Ramey, played by Forrest Whitaker, attempts to talk Stu out of the phoneboot, but to no avail.  Finally, Stu is able to alert the police with his cell phone about the sniper.<p>This is an excellent DVD.  The pop-up screens really help the viewer follow the action more closely.  Colin Farrell, Forrest Whitaker, Radha Mitchell, and Katie Holmes all give excellent performances throughout the movie.  The viewer only gets to see Kiefer Sutherland briefly at the end, but his voice really makes the caller scary and menacing.  Watch this highly entertaining psychological thriller.  You'll never want to use a phonebooth again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fragmented psychological thriller"></head><body><p>Adrien Brody is the kind of actor that can pull off something like "The Jacket", a film way out of the mainstream that is more cerebral than emotional, more visual than literal, more reliant on its script that the beauty of its stars, and more difficult to follow than any other Brody film I've seen.<br /><br />Brody plays a Gulf War veteran going through a sequence of psychiatric rehabilitation where he enters a couple new worlds -- one in the past and one in the future. He used these visits to put together his own life story and that of the person that eventually becomes his significant other.<br /><br />After about an hour I figured out the ending, although I did not imagine the precise event our star would go through to get there. But this predictability was quite obvious and was played out at the end of the film with a bit of a twist.<br /><br />Brody is one of the most compelling film presences in today's cinema and he uses his ability and charisma to maintain interest in this movie, which can be hard to follow and episodic. He looks even thinner here than he did in his role as "The PIanist", where he lost 30 pounds to play the role. He has virtually no meat on him, a stark contrast to his romantic bad boy role in "Love The Hard Way".<br /><br />So rent, buy or borrow this to see one of the world's great actors in his newest role. This movie is far from maintstream Hollywood so beware viewers that like nice little movie packages. It has a nice ending, if that matters to you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A movie of epic proportions"></head><body><p>I am by far no fan of any film that has Jerry Bruckheimer's name stamped all over it. To me, Jerry Bruckheimer represents everything wrong with most big budgeted films in Hollywood, all action and no substance. I didn't have much interest in seeing "King Arthur" over the summer but when I had the opportunity to review the unedited version on dvd, I thought to give "King Arthur" a chance. I'm glad I did. I found myself loving the film from the moment I saw a young Lancelot to the last scene.<br /><br />I didn't go into this film expecting the the film to be the truth but to be entertained instead so I wasn't expecting a history lesson. I definitely was entertained. The film begins with a young Lancelot being recruited by the Roman empire to serve in its military for fifteen years which was a common practice for British men during the era (at least in the film). Speed ahead fifteen years, Arthur and his fellow knights are just about to complete their indentured servitude to the Roman empire when they are given one last mission to rescue a young man destined to be a pop from the invading Saxon army. This final mission (which was not by choice) causes minor conflict for Arthur and the knights of the Round Table. During the course of the mission, Arthur encounters Guinevere and her brother and rescuses them along with the Romans before the Saxons could reach the castle.<br /><br />I enjoyed the performances by all the actors involved but I really thought Clive Owen as Arthur and Kiera Knightley as Guinevere really stood out for me. I liked the fact that Guinevere was by no means your atypical damsel in distress. She was just as much as a warrior as she was as a young woman. The battle scenes with the Saxons were visually spectacular. The costumes were great, especially King Arthur's armor which reminded me of Russell Crowe in "Gladiator". What really made this film enjoyable for me is Hans Zimmer's gorgeous film score and the gorgeous vocals of Moira Brennan. I loved the music.<br /><br />My only fault I could find "King Arthur" is that this film reminded me too much of either "Braveheart" or "Gladiator". I felt that this film was trying to be the big, epic dramas those films were. I thought the speech Clive Owen gives before he and his fellow knights go into their final battle with the Saxons was cheesy and sounded too much like the cheesy speech that Mel Gibson gives in "Braveheart". As wonderfully choreographed as the battle scenes were, I thought the choreography was a bit too polished and I thought I was watching a ballet, not a movie, like in "Gladiator". Overall, I enjoyed "King Arthur" immensely for all its flaws and gaffes. The bonus dvd features were very entertaining to watch as well.</p></body></html>

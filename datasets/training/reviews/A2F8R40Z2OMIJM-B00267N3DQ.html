<meta name="summary" content="Disney Magic Makes SNOW WHITE Classic DVD"></head><body><p>I was extremely excited to receive this DVD....  Upon opening it, one gets the feeling that it is truly a special edition.  The packaging is very nice: the DVD box is sturdy with two openings for each disk.  The pamphlet inside the DVD is gorgeously produced and very helpful.<p>My first impression is that Disney has spent much time making this DVD user-friendly.  There is an abundance of directions and drawings showing you what is on the disk and how to get there.  Since there are two disks and a KINGDOM of information to pour through, these directions are very welcome (even to this seasoned DVD-viewer!)<p>Disney pulls out some familiar faces to make the experience as warm as possible:  Disney himself appears in various footage; Angela Lansbury narrates the documentary and provides a &quot;tour&quot; of the disks; Michael Eisner shows up; and Barbra Streisand sings a specially recorded version of &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come&quot;.<p>SNOW WHITE, the movie, looks gorgeous and, although old fashioned, is quite wonderful.  SNOW WHITE, the double-disk, is a lot of information to wade through.  I am amazed at the amount of behind-the-scenes film that exists!  Disney must have suspected that he was creating a classic - he filmed every aspect of it!  I especially enjoy the HALL OF ART section.  There are 3 halls of various story art (i.e. &quot;The cottage&quot;; &quot;The castle&quot;; &quot;the Forest&quot;; etc.)  Although initially I found it hard to move from hall to hall, I eventually figured it out.  The animated HALLS are extraordinary and the art that &quot;hangs&quot; there is incredible -- various renderings and attempts at bringing the story and locales of SNOW WHITE alive.  It's even more incredible that Disney Co. held on to these papers for all these years.<p>Well, in case you can't tell, I highly recommend the special SNOW WHITE disks.  You will spend days looking at everything that is included -- or you can opt to spend an hour and a half viewing the original,gorgeous film that started the Disney empire....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="absolutly brilliant"></head><body><p>ok, at first i only heard of lost and always shrugged it off. but then after the success of desperate housewives and the huge speculation and fan base review i finally sucumbed to lost and got season 1 on DVD and was BLOWN away. it was a supurbly acted show with smart writing, top-notch thrills, the axing of main characters, and mysteries that left people talking. the show is about flight 815 when it suddenly crashes, stranding 48 people on a uncharted island but it was then the islanders found out this island...had many secrets from the french woman, poler bears on a tropicle island, the mysterious group called the 'others', a set of cursed numbers, and the strange hatch in the ground. the cast is manly composed of 14 main characters each with there own background and story that somehow ties them with the island. all this leads to a huge cliffhanger that will leave people scrambling to find out about season 2. so buy this truley great show that will leave you breathless.</p></body></html>

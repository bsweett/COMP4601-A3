Singer told 20th Century Fox that, if they would wait until he completed SUPERMAN RETURNS, he would make X-MEN III as well. Fox decided to go ahead without Singer, bringing numerous directors on to the project before settling on Brett Ratner. This worried fans ever more, as they realized that Ratner's previous films included RUSH HOUR, MONEY TALKS, and THE FAMILY MAN. What many fans forgot is that Ratner also directed the superb RED DRAGON. Personally, I was optimistic. Ratner's work on both RUSH HOUR movies and on RED DRAGON had impressed me, and I thought that he could do a nice job on the film.<br /><br />I was right - sort of. Ratner does a fine job, but he tends to favor shots that are either very close or very far away. Because of this, he creates a sort of claustrophobic feeling which hung with me throughout the film. Also, he can't wring great performances out of the actors like Bryan Singer can. On the plus side, Ratner does create some stunning visuals (with lots of help from the special effects team) - namely a sequence involving the Golden Gate Bridge. Though Ratner is potentially a very good director, he is nowhere near as talented as Bryan Singer.<br /><br />Three other new additions to the crew are screenwriters Simon Kinberg (MR. & MRS. SMITH) and Zak Penn (BEHIND ENEMY LINES, ELEKTRA) and composer John Powell (THE BOURNE IDENTITY). The script is good, though it feels like the events in the film are rather rushed. Perhaps editors Mark Goldblatt, Mark Helfrich, and Julia Wong - taking over for John Ottman - are to blame for this. I also noticed that some of Wolverine's lines seemed forced; they didn't seem natural like those from the previous films. I must say that the ending, however, is very clever. Very clever indeed.<br /><br />Then we come to the matter of the soundtrack. John Powell's music fluctuated between being grand and atrocious. It's a sweeping score, but it seems a little too over-the-top. It's not as good as John Ottman's score for X2 or Michael Kamen's score for X-MEN, but it will suffice.<br /><br />The cast seemed far less stellar this time. At her request, Halle Berry's part was expanded. Though I've always thought that Storm was an interesting character - and Berry did very well as her in the first two films - her performance seems rather weak in this film. Hugh Jackman is still excellent as Wolverine, but even his performance isn't as wonderful as it was in the previous films. Then we have Ian McKellen, who is just outstanding as Magneto. He shines in each and every one of his scenes. Famke Janssen is great, although she doesn't get many lines. Also great is Kelsey Grammer as Hank McCoy (a.k.a. Beast), Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde, and especially Vinnie Jones (LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, SNATCH.) as Juggernaut. Juggernaut is a hulking character whose special ability is plowing through everything and everyone with no difficulty whatsoever. Jones turns Juggernaut into an extremely amusing character. His scenes are the most fun of any in the film.<br /><br />As both a comic book fan and an avid moviegoer, I enjoyed this film very much. However, the comic fan within me wishes that we'd learnt the origins of Hank McCoy (which I've also found very interesting) and seen Gambit, one of the major X-Men characters from the comics (LOST's Josh Holloway, a perfect choice, was offered the part but turned it down). Though it does seem rushed and a little short (it clocks in at 106 minutes, compared to X2's 133 minutes), I had a ball throughout the movie. I'd have liked to see Joss Whedon or Matthew Vaughn as director (both of whom were attached to the project at one time), but Brett Ratner did a good job. X-MEN: THE LAST STAND isn't up to par with Bryan Singer's X-MEN and X2, but it's a fine film nonetheless.</p></body></html>

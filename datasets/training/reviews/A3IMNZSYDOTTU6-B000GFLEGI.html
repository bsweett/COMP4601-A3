<meta name="summary" content="'Land' A Great 'Dead' Film...Romero Does It Again..."></head><body><p>It took 20 years for us Romero fans to finally witness firsthand the long-awaited fourth 'Dead' movie. Romero had been rumored to be considering it for many years, and up until now we had wondered if he would ever make another film. Well wait no longer fans...we now have this fourth entry in the 'Dead' film series, and was it worth the wait? You bet!<br /><br />LAND OF THE DEAD takes on the premise of picking up slightly where DAY OF THE DEAD left off, but really it has its own beginning and end. The film opens with the squad of militants left killing off the mindless zombies and dumping them in the garbage. Many of the dead are now walking the streets, but there's something very different about them now...and the lead Zombie (played in awesome fashion by Eugene Clark) is getting smarter. We see the zombies watching fireworks in the sky which seems to distract them so these militants can kill off the zombies one by one. Many of the survivors are now in an enclosed city run by the corrupt Mr. Kaufman (played by the as usual good Dennis Hopper, who seems to inhabit villain or corrupt roles with such gusto. Bravo Mr. Hopper!!), and the zombies roaming the streets in the wastelands of suburbs are starting to evolve. This was one of the best elements of the movie...giving the zombies some type of personality...they now realize their fate and what they have to do. It really makes the film quite interesting and a little bit creepier than most other films of this day and age. The zombies proceed, following the lead zombie, to infiltrate the city and eventually start killing off the population one by one. The gore in this uncensored version is absolutely creepy and you will cringe every time a zombie rips flesh, tears off a limb, or rips off a head. It almost looks realistic. There is more gore in this one then there was in DAY OF THE DEAD. The fast pace time of the movie (at 97 minutes long) also helps to make this a very entertaining and creepy entry in the DEAD film series. The ending was actually kind of smart too, but I don't want to give it away to anyone because you'll enjoy it yourself. Let's just say the zombies aren't completely killed off by the end and there is a destiny for them. Most of the actors, especially Leguizamo, Simon Baker, and the sexy Asia Argento, are all on their game here. Watch for a surprise cameo from none other than make-up stalwart Tom Savini...<br /><br />George Romero continues to impress to this day, and LAND OF THE DEAD just further cements his status as an essential director in the horror film genre (and more specifically, the zombie genre). LAND OF THE DEAD presents a much different picture than DAY OF THE DEAD...and it's a great film that will continue the resurgence of horror films today.</p></body></html>

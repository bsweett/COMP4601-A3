<meta name="summary" content="Are The Tales Really All That Tall?"></head><body><p>I really liked this movie, and despite its emotional ending I was somewhat disappointed to find out that the man was a liar all along.  Okay, the few final scenes may be open to interpretation, but I still say the guy's a liar.  Of course, most people probably know that before they even open the DVD box, but I've always been quite gullible.<br /><br />But the more I thought about it, the more I thought that we all have tall tales to tell about ourselves.  I mean, I've had a cat that could sleep with his eyes open, I've had a job where I cremated people, I once drove home and saw part of a miniature golf course lying on my neighbor's lawn, I've beaten a multi time world champion powerlifter in an official meet, and I once arm wrestled a guy who survived the concentration camps of the holocaust.  All of these statements are true, but I'm leaving out a lot of information regarding each one on purpose.  I guess knowing what not to say is an important part of storytelling too.<br /><br />The music in the film is perfect.  Perfect.  The tall tales are pretty good at bordering reality and fantasy just right, although there are one or two instances where they cut clear into fantasy completely.<br /><br />Big Fish may not have the originality of The Neverending Story, but it certainly has a lot of charm.  The Alabama setting adds a lot to the atmosphere.  The title fits in perfectly with the symbolism and themes.  I don't recall the use of any bad language.  It's probably the closest thing to a George MacDonald story you'll find on film.<br /><br />(12/12/09 - actually, I do remember some slightly bad language from Devito, and the kids visiting the witch house)</p></body></html>

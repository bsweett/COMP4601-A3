This movie had neither of those elementary elements and therefore this cannot be a good movie.<br /><br />I do not care for extreme violence simply because violence for "violence sake" does not make a good movie. When you see enough violence you get de-sensatized and there is no longer any shock value.<br /><br />When you actually care about the character and there exists suspense...that is when the violence has meaning.  This movie had no emotional contents. The violence was simply mean and exploitive yet this film was hardly scary or suspenseful.<br /><br />The ending was so silly, it practically qualifies as the ridiculous "it's only a dream ending".<br /><br />This movie shows weak, vulnerable people getting killed. The killer in this movie is a frumpy, fat, 60 year old hillbilly. Lets see how he does against a more able bodied opponent...Oh, I am sorry...that is inconsistent with frail people (in this film) getting killed.<br /><br />In contrast, if you compare this to a good zombie film, with all the graphic cannibalism, because that violence examines the horroric concept of getting eaten alive...it leastit stresses how dire the premise is. There, the extreme violence serves a purpose.In this fil, the violence serves no purpose since there is no suspense, scares or anything.<br /><br />People patronize this film and you wonder why society has unexplainable violence!</p></body></html>

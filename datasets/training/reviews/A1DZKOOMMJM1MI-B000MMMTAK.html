<meta name="summary" content="Borat was the worst film of the year...NOT!"></head><body><p>I finally got to see "Borat" in its fourth week of release. I have to say, I enjoyed every minute. While the plot is a bit shallow, the film itself is frank, funny, and cruel. It definitely unmasks the hypocritical, shallow, and disgusting society we live in. Even when people know a camera is pointed to their face, they say and do things they know they will later regret. It makes for fascinating viewing, and a wonderful opportunity to laugh at the idiots trying to sue Cohen after signing releases allowing him to use the footage.<br /><br />This was the funniest movie I have seen in a long time...Cohen is hilarious...I can't wait for "Bruno" to come out next year!</p></body></html>

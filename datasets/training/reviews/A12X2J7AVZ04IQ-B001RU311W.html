Mickey Rourke was certainly solid, but Penn has proven again that there isn't much he can't do; the new Dustin Hoffman? Researching his roles? Penn is excellent in this role, aided by one of the best supporting casts ever assembled. Credit to director Gus Van Sant, but mostly to the flawless script of Lance Black. The story of Harvey Milk had been attempted by many, but with Black's script, it finally found fruition, so to speak. Bravo to all involved.  AFTERTHOUGHT: The Indie Spirit Awards honored Mr. Black and James Franco, but no nomination for the Film, nor for Mr. Penn & Mr. Van Sant. Bad feelings? How objective is that? Doesn't seem fair to me.</p></body></html>

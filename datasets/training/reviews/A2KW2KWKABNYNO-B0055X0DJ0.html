Along the way, thousands of innocent civilians are killed, but who cares, the Decepticons always lose at the end of the day right? That is until new ones are created, or brought back to life by other pesky Decepticons from outer space. It is then where College Freshman Shia Laboef (I hate spelling his, or his character's last name) must then help save humanity, with the help of familiar friends and Meagan Fox, who filmmakers could find no better reason to be in this film other than cheesy emotional scenes and eye candy.<br /><br />I must admit, this film is impossible for a real movie reviewer, or critics to review because their job title has them breaking down movies to see if you should enjoy them. Unfortunately, if you break this film down, it loses all it's fun. So don't think, just sit and enjoy.<br /><br />See It If:<br /><br />You like Awesome action: This is almost a pure action movie, because the fighting sequences are stunning, and really make you get into the movie despite any flaws it may have. Sure, a 20-minute action sequence may be overblown, but I was enjoying every moment of it.<br /><br />You like comedy that is funny in the moment: To balance the intense action, the writers upped the quotient on comedy this time around, having several LOL jokes that kept a semi-permanent smile on my face throughout the film, especially in the college scenes. Kudos especially to Kevin Dunn, Julie White, and Rainn Wilson who play Shia's parents and teacher, respectively. I could have done without the juvenile scenes of dogs humping which a 6-year old sitting a few seats down from me found particularly enjoyable. However, don't think about these jokes later, because you mind lose your mind trying to wrap it around these jokes.<br /><br />Don't See It If:<br /><br />Your movies are driven on plot: This plot is one in the moment as you get it when it's happening, but you're left wondering later how the heck they got there. Again, don't think, just sit and enjoy.<br /><br />Your tolerance for pure stupidity is low: Yeah, this has been beaten to death by other reviewers. You have been warned.<br /><br />You hated the Transformers mythology: Because if you got confused before, you're going to be scratching your head here. It's like they went for the geeks, and left the rest of us just to ignore that aspect, because it gets confusing.<br /><br />Now For Some Observations:<br /><br />This movie is very grounded in 2009... Swine Flu jokes? Economy jokes? And a Chevy Volt? Will anybody get what any of this means in 10 years?<br /><br />Speaking of which, from the first scenes GM makes their presence known because they must have gotten a HUGE contract with the government.<br /><br />Obama is anti-Transformer! He's mentioned specifically by name in the movie as wanting to shut down the Transformers program as he feels they could be a threat to nation's security. I mean, he is pro immigration! His National Security advisor is also a jerk within the movie, so it shows poor judgement in his staff choices... Republicans, ravage at this fact, Democrats steer clear of these scenes.<br /><br />Did the composer get lazy in this movie? I counted no less than 4 times Linkin Park's "New Divide" was played in the movie either instrumentally or in full. Same goes for Green Day's "21 Guns" which I counted no less than 5 times during the movie. It also happened to be the ONLY song playing in Meagan Fox's garage.<br /><br />Again, a LOT of civilians die in this movie. In the first I was shocked when a Decepticon plowed through a bus, but in this movie, that's nothing. Buildings are wiped out, cars are smashed at will, aircraft carriers are blown up with no survivors. It's almost numbing after a while.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />In a survey of viewers that saw the movie, 91% said it was as good, if not better than the first. I would join these people in saying that what the first one sets up, the sequel takes and runs away with in explosive fashion. And despite its many flaws, I was fully-engrossed in the movie, and you will be too if you don't try to break it down, or take it too seriously. But I must admit I have seen this movie 4 or 5 times now, and it grates on me more every time I see it, so keep repeat viewing at an absolute minimum. Keep your unbridled joy of watching the first time in your memory.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable Retro Fluff Just Like The Show"></head><body><p>There's an unwritten formula: when a dusty '70s show gets branded cool again, a shoddy and blasphemous remake is quickly shunted out by soulless studios, made hastily and carelessly enough not to miss the boat before Open All Hours gets its comeback. Scooby-Doo did it, and- sorry if you were in the process of wiping this one out of your memory- The Avengers did too. But somehow Starsky And Hutch avoids remake clich&eacute;s by revelling in the irony goldmine left vacant by the TV show.<br /><br />Top marks go to the casters for revolving the film around trusted comedy performers rather than straight-faced, perfectly groomed Hollywood big-shots. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson- who tickled the world together in Zoolander and The Royal Tenembaums- have now perfected the geeky, uptight but loveable goon and laid-back chick magnet. Snoop Dogg has a go at stealing the show in his 15 minutes of screen time as Huggy Bear- a role he seems to have spent his whole life emulating.<br /><br />Despite the absence of a Wilson writing credit, the script strikes a balance of comedy and wisely simple plot. It's never laugh-out-loud funny but then, with heavy dollops of nostalgia, irony and references to navigate through, it's no problem. Those two hours will cruise by like a high-speed Torino</p></body></html>

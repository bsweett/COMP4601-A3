<meta name="summary" content="zero and 1/2 star options would suit this junk"></head><body><p>its only saving grace was the almost always brilliant tom c.as for j foxx,well he played a black cab driver well.half his act came naturally(and why he got such praise for playing a blind black guy-ray charles-is beyond me...just bobble your head from side to side and walk funny....how impressive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)anyway,back to this nonsense.tom is a contract killer who needs to off some saps in 1 night.and his only means of accomplishing this is by way of taxi cab.dont you just love gimmicks?!?!?!?!?ok,after witnessing the 1st murder,its obvious that j foxx charactor has but 2 options.....walk away and hand cab over to tom OR risk sticking around and hoping tom doesnt kill witnesses.and wasnt that a touching scene in the hospital?!?!?!?awww.....this movie is silly and j foxx,as funny as he kinda is,is just the flavor of the moment.silly,silly movie.</p></body></html>

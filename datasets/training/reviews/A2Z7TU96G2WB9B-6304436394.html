<meta name="summary" content="Good scenes, but not much of a big picture"></head><body><p>After watching Desperado, I was excited to see this movie coming out, especially knowing that Selma Hayek was in this one also.  Seeing Johnny Depp joining the film as an American agent promised a good film.  Unfortunately, I really don't feel the film quite coalesced into a coherent whole.<p>Parts of the movie are flashbacks, which prevent us from getting a solid flow. Although flashbacks often work, I never quite got the feeling that all the flashbacks helped us understand what was happening in the present day.  We are also introduced to characters, which have their pasts hinted at (like the former FBI agent or the other two members of the mariachi band), but we never get enough of the characters to feel that they fit.  They seem more like a quick plot device used to fill a gap.<p>The movie has Johnny Depp playing the role of an agent trying to stay in control of the situation.  His character is tough as well as funny.  Some of his lines will stay with you, as the director or writer seemed to make him a second focal point for the movie, which does not seem to have helped.<p>The movie also has Willem DaFoe, but I really don't feel that I saw his character much.  I have the feeling that maybe his big scenes had been cut from the movie.  He seems out of place.<p>If you are a die-hard fan of one of the actors in the film, then I would see it.  Otherwise, I would recommend giving this one a slip.</p></body></html>

I did enjoy &quot;Spartan,&quot; despite gaping holes in the plot.  The film has a great look to it, and Kilmer is good as the tough &quot;mission first&quot; agent Scott.  The dialogue is tough, but in a way that has you thinking here's a (good) poet writing noir.  For example, the repetitions regarding the need to &quot;find the girl&quot; was poet-cool, and dropped at just about the moment it would of started to get annoying.  The fact she's the President's daughter is left unsaid, at least until the midway point, but you are able to make this connection with that fact unsaid. (And the unseen &quot;President&quot; in &quot;Spartan&quot; seems to be a combo of Clinton &amp; Bush: a warmongering whoremonger.) But it's also at about the midway point that Kilmer has a conversation with a female agent that had been assigned to protect the President's daughter over the years.  It has to be one of the most unintentionally funny scenes I've seen in a good movie in quite a while, and had me picking up on other &quot;moments&quot; as the movie went on.  (But not enough to wreck the film, by any means.)  On the bad side, super character actor William Macy is nearly wasted, a virtual non-entity for most of the movie. No doubt this role was as Mamet envisioned it, a character flying beneath radar, for that twist at the end.  But if that's the case, a more anonymous actor would of been a better choice. On the good side, Ed O'Neil, as the ruthless Burch, further cements his own credentials as one of Hollywood's best character actors. And watch and listen carefully, or you will miss the why of the title.  Not an exact fit, but it worked for me, in a wonderfully (and classically) understated way, and fit Kilmer's character as we'd grown to know him.  Definitely worth a watch. Just don't peek too closely under the hood of this nifty looking car.</p></body></html>

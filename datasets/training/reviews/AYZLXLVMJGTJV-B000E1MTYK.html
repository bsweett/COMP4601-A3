I loved the chariot with the birds in the sky. I loved the portal that takes you to a renaissance fair with magic and fun. A tent that looks small from the outside but is a castle on the inside. I liked the expanding campy maze with the creeps and brainwash that it held. I liked the gillyweed that makes Potters neck have gills. I liked the ball and the rock out concert after. I liked the ease of Potter and his friends and their love for one another. I liked the neat potions and the magic classes. But real magic. The bowl with things from the past floating in the water. The huge bathtub with suds and a ghostly funny girl to talk to. The broom riding, the adventures with dragons and a challenge with outstanding magic. Dinners with extrodinare fare, sweets and sours. The dark and the fun all mixed together, a castle in a skyfilled valley with cliffs and mountains and magical life.</p></body></html>

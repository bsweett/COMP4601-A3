The bad news is that James Wan only returned to do some of the script work for Saw III. Wan, who also directed the first film, created one of the enduring horror movies of the decade so far; Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed the second film in the franchise, turned in what was, at best, just another cheesy survival thriller that lacked any echo of the characterization, complexity, and finesse that made the first one so good. Guess who directs Saw III?<br /><br />I'm sure you've seen at least one sitcom episode where there's a loose frame story that exists for the sole purpose of replaying amusing scenes from earlier in the season. That's, in part, the direction Saw III takes-- there's a lot of flashback footage in this movie. Which is really kind of depressing, because Wan came up with a real barnburner of a story idea here-- Jigsaw (Tobin Bell, reprising his role) and his assistant Amanda (Shawnee Smith, reprising hers) are the focus here. They've kidnapped Lynn (Crash's Bahar Soomekh), a doctor with marital problems, to keep Jigsaw alive during his final game, one in which Jeff (Titus' Angus McFadyen) must forgive the driver who killed his son in a hit-and-run accident, as well as a number of others who, directly or indirectly, contributed to his son's death. Jeff's game, however, is almost a background here, as the focus remains on Lynn, Amanda, and Jigsaw. And, of course, there's an awesome twist ending (with the most blatant "if you're not paying attention, you'll miss it" clue since Profondo Rosso) that leads us straight into Saw IV. And had Wan's idea been perfectly translated, I have no doubt this would have been an excellent movie, easily the equal of the first one.<br /><br />"Perfectly translated," however, it is not. It has once again gone through the blender that is Leigh Whannell, but again without Wan's butt in the director's chair mitigating Whannell's inability to characterize. We see an even worse flaw of Whannell's in the opening scenes of Saw III: Dina Meyer, Costas Mandylor, and Donnie Wahlberg's characters, all of whom survived Saw II, appear in the movie's opening scenes and are eliminated for no reason. (Well, there's a reason, but it's a desperately flimsy one that's obviously the thinnest of layers over "hey, we have cool devices and nowhere else in the movie to use them.") While the movie's better than its predecessor, "better" is something of a relative term. It's certainly not the equal of the first film, but it doesn't quite have the "let's trample all over the legacy of the first film" feel to it that the second one does. Watchable, at least. **</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Scumacher screws up yet again."></head><body><p>Phone Booth (Joel Schumacher, 2003)<p>I got suckered again. I admit it. I watched yet another recent Joel Schumacher film. This time, I figured, Schumacher has himself a fantastic cast, it can't be any worse than Liberty Stands Still, and, really, it's less than eighty minutes long. How bad can it be?<p>To answer that question, I will say that my first comment after the movie was over was "the best thing about it was that it was less than eighty minutes long."<p>Colin Farrell (who is finally breaking out of the "I'm a soldier" stereotype) stars as Stu, a very not-nice guy who lies for a living. (He's a media publicist.) Stu makes a phone call from the same phone booth in New York City every day. On the last day before Verizon (nice product placement, there) is set to tear down the phone booth, while Stu is making his daily call, a guy tries to deliver him a pizza in the phone booth. Stu gets rid of the guy, then the phone starts to ring. He answers it and finds himself in conversation with another very not-nice guy (Kiefer Sutherland), who just happens to have a sniper rifle, and it's trained on the phone booth. If Stu hangs up, he dies. The sniper spends the rest of the film doing various things to put Stu into uncomfortable situations.<p>Sound like the kind of thing a mean, well-armed teenager would do? Well, yeah. Wesley Snipes, in Liberty Stands Still, at least had himself a cause (even if it was a misguided one). This guy is just there for the fun of it, really, unless you believe his story about wanting to make Stu a better person by making him confess his sins in public. There's not really enough here to make it buyable. The sniper comes off like a sadistic juvenile. Stu comes off like someone who's perfectly content to be emotionally manipulated, and his gradual transformation into said Better Person is completely unbelievable. (This is not to take away from Farrell's acting job, which on its own might have pulled this off, had he not been handed such an awful script.)<p>Schumacher, who decides about halfway through that you can't turn My Dinner with Andre into a suspense film, brings in the big guns. The police arrive on the scene, captained by Forest Whitaker, a man who needs no introduction, but has suddenly found himself in a number of roles that do no justice at all to his magnificent talent. Ghost Dog, phone home, we miss you. Stu's wife and would-be girlfriend are played by the wonderful Radha Mitchell (Pitch Black, High Art) and the decent Katie Holmes (Go, The Gift) respectively, and their parts are painful to watch. Mitchell, one of the great underrated actresses of our time, is given sharkbait to work with, and to her credit treats the material with the respect it deserves, zilch. Holmes' part actually has some potential, early on. (Of course, his conversation with Holmes' character in the first few minutes is long enough to have some meat to it, whereas his conversation with Mitchell is obviously of the "we need to introduce this character, how will we do it?" variety.) Unfortunately, when Holmes turns up again halfway through the movie, her entire part consists of standing in a crowd with a pained look on her face.<p>Given a cast like this, a proven situation, and even the barest competency in scriptwriting, camerawork, and direction, you've got a surefire winner. But the script was written by the inconsistent Larry Cohen, who turns out the odd script that fires (Best Seller, The Stuff) now and again, and the rest of the time turns out, well, the Maniac Cop movies and the third It's Alive movie, Island of the Alive. (If you haven't seen it, you've spared yourself a good deal of trauma.) Cinematographer Matthew Libatique provides hard evidence that good cinematography doesn't always outperform bad direction; the man who single-handedly made Tigerland barely watchable falters here with almost every step, which is extremely out of character (he's also Darren Aronofsky's preferred cinematographer. Nuff said.)  And then there is Joel Schumacher, who has completely forgotten how to make a good film since 1990. The guy who made Flatliners could have pulled this off without a second thought. But Joel Schumacher is no longer the guy who made Flatliners. He's the guy who made the last two Batman flops. * ?</p></body></html>

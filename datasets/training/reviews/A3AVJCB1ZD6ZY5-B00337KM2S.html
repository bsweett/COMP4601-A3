<meta name="summary" content="Clooney's flying high in this traveling epic (4.5 stars)"></head><body><p>Ryan Bingham's (Clooney) a hired gun--he literally flies all around the world firing people for big companies without the cajones to do it themselves.  While he's redirecting the newly fired employees' anger to finding their new goals, he's on his way to his life's goal--10 million frequent flier miles--when Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) literally grounds him.  Her brilliant and economical idea:  use teleconferencing to fire people.<br /><br />But first, Ryan's got to teach Natalie the ropes so she can design the program. The two of them go out on the road where Natalie learns such things as how to accumulate miles and which travelers to get behind to get through the lines faster.<br /><br />In this case both have a lot to learn from each other.  Natalie loses her love and Ryan thinks he's found his with Alex (Vera Farmiga). The story's poignant and painful and truly one of Clooney's best roles.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, December 2009</p></body></html>

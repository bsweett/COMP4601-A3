<meta name="summary" content="Mixed emotions over a well-made film"></head><body><p>Tim Burton has made a GREAT film that incorporates the greatest aspect of classic horror: creepiness, suspense and just the right amount of humor.<p>The production values are superb and have Burton's fingerprints all over them.  The performances are great, from Depp's whimsical but squeamish &quot;Constable&quot; Ichabod Crane to a supporting cast that is, simply put, to die for.<p>Where I fault the film (it would be a 3 1/2 for me) is the loss of Washington Irving's original vision.  Ichabod Crane is not the hero of the story.  He doesn't rid the town of the Headless Horseman.  Of course, this doesn't quite fit the bill for a Depp/Burton vehicle.  This would have made a fun sequel -- what happened after Ichabod disappeared.  As it is, it is a very shaky reworking that over-analyzes Crane's childhood and introduces too many plot and character changes to really make it recognizable.<p>Would that Burton had brought the original story to film with this much energy and whimsy and spookiness.  Alas, it was not meant to be, but it's still a good film overall.</p></body></html>

HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES is his attempt at bringing his "every day should be halloween" vision to the screen. Like an unholy mixture of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Spider Baby, Natural Born Killers, and VH1's Surviving Nugent; H-O-1K-C is by no means a classic, but does have it's moments. I loved the beginning at Captain Spaulding's gas station / fried chicken stand / Murder and Madness Museum. Sid Haig (Spider Baby) made an excellent host of the ghoulish festivities. The Murder Ride was well done, like an animatronic tour of hell. We learn about the notorious Dr. Satan, who is ufortunately not used enough in the story. I'd watch a whole movie about his exploits! We meet the four dopey kids who will go on to the actual house itself, a spook-house loaded with twisted hillbillies and their victims (why is it always the rural folk??). This long section is fairly entertaining, yet somehow dull. Even while cheerleaders were being slaughtered, I found myself checking my watch! Lots of flash - very little fear. Even Karen Black (Trilogy Of Terror, Burnt Offerings, It's Alive 3) had a hard time spicing things up! Baby (Sherri Moon) wasn't bad, but was overused, while Tiny and the others just sort of lumbered about like extras. The final chapter in the underground catacombs is great and shows what the rest of the movie could have been. Sadly, it goes by too fast! I'm looking forward to Zombie's next feature, as few seem to have the appreciation for monsters (both human and inhuman) that he has. Hopefully, his next venture will be better...</p></body></html>

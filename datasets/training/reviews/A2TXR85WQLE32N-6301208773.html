As sardonic, hard-hitting everyman New York City police detective John McClane, Willis had found his signature role.<br /><br />John McClane arrives in Los Angeles on Christmas Eve, planning to spend the Christmas Holidays with his estranged business executive wife (played by Bonnie Bedelia) and their two children.  While McClane waits in his wife's office for a holiday party to break up, terrorists break in and take control of the party-goers and the 40 story office building they work in.  McClane, barefoot and armed with his service pistol, escapes and fights back.<br /><br />The balance of the movie is an often vicious cat-and-mouse game within the highrise between the trigger-happy terrorists and a cunning McClane, who slowly figures out the terrorist game plan and improvises ways to interfere.  McClane is helped by an L.A. cop (Reginald ValJean) outside the building and nearly killed by an ham-handed FBI hostage rescue team.  As McClane eliminates the terrorists one by one, the terrorists in turn resort to increasingly savage methods to kill the one obstacle to their success. The stage is set for a final do-or-die confrontation with the leader of the terrorists, played with snarling charm by Alan Rickman.<br /><br />The nooks and crannies of the highrise turn out to be a surprisingly supportive set for a series of narrow ambushes and escapes.  Supporting actors like a smarmy news reporter (played by William Atherton) add color and sometimes humor to what is otherwise a tense movie that lurches from action sequence to action sequence.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as an entertaining and very effective action movie.</p></body></html>

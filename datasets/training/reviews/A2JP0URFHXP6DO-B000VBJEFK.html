While they were both very good, "Meet the Robinsons" was a bit more cerebral and I thought its concepts of time travel may have been a bit much for younger kids to grasp. On the other hand, Ratatouille is a true screwball comedy, almost more in the spirit of old Warner Brothers Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny cartoons. It's a pure slapstick farce, and kids will have no problem laughing their heads off here.<br /><br />Comedian Patton Oswalt shines in the lead role as Remy, a rat with an acute sense of smell and a taste for fine food. When Remy and his clan are ran out of their previous home, Remy ends up in downtown Paris at the restaurant of recently deceased chef Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett). Gusteau's will calls for his restaurant to go to a family heir and if none are found, it passes to the head chef, Skinner. Of course, he does have an unknown heir working right in the restaurant. Linguini (Lou Romano) is a shy young man without the slightest bit of skills in the kitchen. That all changes when he meets Remy who hides under Linguini's hat and controls his movements to create dishes that thrill the customers at Gusteau's and rankle Skinner who is determined to find out his secrets. Gusteau's spirit visits Remy, providing sage advice along the way.<br /><br />While Linguini is learning skills from chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo), Remy runs into conflict with his father Django (Brian Dennehy) who shows in rather graphic fashion, what happens when rats get too close to humans. He wants Remy to return to the clan but Remy is determined to help Linguini win the restaurant from the evil Skinner. Peter O' Toole almost steals the film near the end playing a food critic named Anton Ego who is the scourge of fine dining. His column can make or break a restaurant. And now Linguini has to cook for him without a staff and without Remy.<br /><br />No offense to Patton Oswalt, but he was born to voice a rat. His light, enthusiastic voice was the perfect match for Remy. I laughed out loud several times when Remy was under Linguini's hat and pulling his hair to drive him like a horse. There's also a great scene when the Health Inspector walks into the kitchen to see hundreds of rats scurrying about, preparing dinner. Peter Sohn as Remy's brother Emile provided further comic relief as a fattened rat who never saw a piece of trash he wouldn't eat. All of the voice talent...even the usually annoying Garofalo...turned in strong performances. The only curious scene involved Skinner trying to get Linguini to talk by getting him drunk on wine. That's an odd scene for a Disney who normally likes to avoid the remotest chance of controversy.<br /><br />There are two weaknesses to the film and DVD. First, at 1 hour and 51 minutes, it's probably too long by about 15 minutes I think. It's hard to keep the interest of young kids for close to two hours. Secondly, the special features on the DVD were light. There is a 13 minute interview with the writer and producer, three deleted scenes, an instruction with Remy on rats as your friend, and a short animated film called "Lifted". A bit skimpy for a Disney DVD.</p></body></html>

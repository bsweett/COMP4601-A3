With good reason... the Nobel prize mathematician's story is a good one. It deserves attention... and director Ron Howard did a wonderful job of creating a masterful piece of Hollywood cinema. Based on Nash's experiences at New Jersey's most famed learning establishment, Princeton University, thru the development of his economic theory ("Nash's Equilibrium"), his marriage to Alicia, and his eventual work at MIT. Imagine if Robert Redford directed and Tom Cruise played the part of Nash as it might have been (they both considered it). I can't see this film being much better... however it would be kind of interesting to see another great director's (and the actor's) take on the same script. Russell Crowe takes the challenge of portraying the man with a chip on both soldiers (in this case schizophrenia), Mr. John Nash, right in stride with his previous preformance as Maximus in "Gladiator". I can't imagine anyone else playing this role of Nash as well as Crowe did. Co-stars Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany and Judd Hirsch round out a wonderful supporting cast. Footnote: Alicia (Connelly) was maybe to evenly tempered in this film thru all of Nash's emotional ups & downs... almost too much so (a performance worthy of an Academy Award... I'm still sitting on the fence about it... it was good, but it wasn't brilliant). Beautifully filmed - partly on location (Princeton Univ, NJ). This is how drama should be. "A Beautiful Mind" will make you think - Is he imagining all this? Yes he is... no he isn't, yes, no, not sure, those people in the shed behind their house ARE real, no they aren't... yes - he is delusional. DVD features include commentary by Ron Howard, deleted scenes with Howard's commentary, meeting John Nash, special effects featurette, and more. Oscar winner for best picture, best director for Howard, best supporting actress for Connelly, and best adapted screenplay. Ron Howard's movies just seem to get better and better... sheriff Andy Taylor must be proud of his favorite TV son.</p></body></html>

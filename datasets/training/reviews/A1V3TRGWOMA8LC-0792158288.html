Now I can't get that damned John Williams music out of my head.<br /><br />It's amazing how the plots don't make any sense whatsoever. I totally missed that as a child, which probably explains why the Harvard scholarship eluded me. Actually, not only are they completely nonsensical, but actually the plot jumps wouldn't be tolerated in a movie today. Cases in point:<br /><br />1. How in the hell did a former girlfriend have the bronze amulet that gains access to the Ark? (And she was wearing that around her neck.)<br />2. How did the Nazis follow Jones or find her 5 minutes after he arrived?<br />3. Indy only helps the Nazis to find the Ark more quickly, and then the Ark kills them all anyway (this problem was repeated in the first Tomb Raider, weirdly enough).<br /><br />... and it goes on and on. You could write hundreds of these.<br /><br />The screenwriting process here is like two caffeine-fueled comic book fans in competition to produce the most outrageous 'and-then' moment:<br /><br />#1: "Now he gets shot in the arm by a Nazi!"<br />#2: "Yeah but now he gets punched out of the windshield of the car!"<br />#1: "BUT he crawls under the moving car and climbs up the other side!"<br />#2: "And then THE NAZI gets thrown out of the windshield!"<br />#1: "BUT only out of the side that's not already broken!"<br />#2: "Yeah but HE gets run over the truck he was driving!"<br />#1: "GREAT! More double-whip no-chai extra-shot latte?"<br />#2: "Sure. Have we mentioned any aliens yet?"<br /><br />But who cares because they're fun movies and Jones is such a good screen character that it's a joy to watch all the BS. I mean, compare these to The Mummy movies, and it's obvious which series people will watch in 10, 20, 30 years time.<br /><br />Doom is the weakest of the three - uncharacteristically dark and sadistic - with the story only kicking off after the midpoint of the film. The sidekick and romantic interests are annoying, and they don't have the 'Champagne bad guy', so the main villain seems very flat. The Last Crusade is clearly when everyone got comfortable with the formula, and is the most expertly made in terms of balance of action scenes, humor and mild drama.<br /><br />Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised by how much sheer fun I had rewatching the set after 15 years - I'm looking forward to #4. It's actually great to see films without CGI in every damned scene... it reminds me of why hanging off a bridge seems like a dangerous idea.<br /><br />PS - The extras are so-so. Don't buy this set if you've already got the films since the 10-15 mins of extras on each disc are disappointing.</p></body></html>

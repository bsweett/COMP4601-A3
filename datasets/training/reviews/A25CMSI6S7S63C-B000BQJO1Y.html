<meta name="summary" content="One of the best Zombie movies ever"></head><body><p>My favorite Zombie movie. The best way to see this is unrated and uncut. Not for the faint at heart or those easily grossed out. Lots of blood,and exposed intestines. Ken Foree was great in this. He is one of 4 survivors trapped in a mall with zombies. They fly to the mall after a drug bust in an apartment where zombies are on the loose. They escape via chopper to a mall. The mall is filled with zombies. Tom Savini leads a gang of bikers who want the mall for themselves and go after Ken & co. (all GREAT performances) and you actually feel bad for the zombies who are getting attacked by Savini & his bikers. Cool twists, cool flick,great acting, & SPFX the best Zombie film if you ask me. The best version of this on DVD is the ultimate edition from Anchor Bay which has 3 versions of the movie(including Dario Argento's version)..</p></body></html>

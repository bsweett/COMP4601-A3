<meta name="summary" content="An Incredible Movie"></head><body><p>Pixar animation has done it again!  Following in the footsteps of such classic animated films as "Finding Nemo" and "Toy Story", this fun-filled and action-packed film will be sure to captivate adults and children alike.<br /><br />Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Helen (Holly Hunter) are the former crime-fighters Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl.  Forced into retirement due to costly lawsuits and a slowly eroding base of support, they are placed in exile and must live the lives of "normal" people while forgoing their superpowers.  Their children Violet, Dash, and baby Jack-Jack have inherited their parent's powers; Violet has the ability to turn invisible and Dash has super speed.  Jack-Jack's powers aren't revealed until the end of the film.<br /><br />Bob takes a job as an insurance adjuster while Helen has set up housekeeping.  Longing to return to his superhero days, Bob is contacted by Mirage (Elizabeth Pena).  She has a top-secret assignment for him on a remote island, but when he arrives, he soon finds out that he has been tricked and lured in by Syndrome (Jason Lee), the former Incrediboy who idolozed Mr. Incredible but was shunned by him.  Bent on revenge, Syndrome has created a robot that has the capacity to learn on its own and Syndrome is threatening to unleash the robot on the unsuspecting city while he in turn destroys the robot himself, making himself look like a real superhero.<br /><br />Helen gets wind of Bob's mysterious journey to the island, and soon she, Violet, and Dash are on the island searching for Bob.  Will Syndrome succeed in his mission?  Will Bob, Helen, Dash, and Violet stop him before its too late?<br /><br />This is a spectacular film.  As with the other successful Pixar films in this genre, the animation is excellent, and the story is first rate.  Although there are some violent parts in this movie, it is still safe for kids to view as well as adults.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  It has quickly become our children's favorite film, and we've watched it together several times, and it keeps getting better with each viewing.  Watch this highly entertaining and exciting film from Pixar and enjoy some animated fun and action!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Longest Yard Scores Modestly."></head><body><p>Under the guiding hand of producer/star Adam Sandler, THE LONGEST YARD is a formulaic sports prison movie that accomplishes its goal to entertain for a couple of hours. Its goal is not to outdo the original, but it makes a decent, companion piece to the great and classic Burt Reynolds original. The inspired Sandler had the good sense of casting Burt Reynolds in the film in a key support role of 'Nate Scarboro'(originated by Michael Conrad-HILL STREET BLUES) and Reynolds had the good mind in accepting it because it was tailor-made for him now that its 30 years since the original was released. In an interview with Reynolds, he stated that he was apprehensive of the whole remake concept along with the fact that he created the 'Paul Crewe' character. However, he realized that the film wasn't 'Shakespeare', so why not? Robert Aldrich directed the first 'YARD' which had a familiar theme from some of his earlier films (FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX, THE DIRTY DOZEN), showing men in dire situations rising to the occasion. Peter Segal directs the sequel with men making smart-alec remarks in comedic situations. In the original there are characters. The remake has caricatures. Also, the original worked as a dramedy, whearas the remake is more comedy. The original film had a bit more suspense with plot twists in the storyline that leads up to the big game. In the remake, the plot simply has to get from Point A to Point B. Lastly, the creators completely missed the meaning of the title of the film which is exemplified by the final play of the game. Sandler/Paul Crewe scores the winning touchdown  and the inmates (The Mean Machine) win the game.  If one watches the original version compared to the remake, one will see why the film is called THE LONGEST YARD.  If the people involved were more creative, they should have had Burt Reynolds reprise the 'Paul Crewe' character and do a sort of THE HUSTLER/COLOR OF MONEY-type sequel. Overall, a typical Adam Sandler crowd pleaser that retains most of the original film's screenplay with some added contemporary themes. (Note: In a weird ironic twist, actor Eddie Albert-tv's GREEN ACRES- who originated the role of 'Warden Hazen' in the first film, died the same weekend the remake was released. - and - Question: Was that Courtney Cox' real cleavage in the film?)</p></body></html>

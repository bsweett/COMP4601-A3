I remember being blown away in the theatre at what he was able to pull off.  Seems the Mad Max films taught Gibson well.  There are definite paralles to Wallace and Max.  The fight for freedom is always a good fight and despite the gory end, Wallace was truely victorious.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

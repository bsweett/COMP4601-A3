It's such a joy to find that the literary characters of ages past could be brought together in one massive idea of someone's imagination. It makes you wonder "Could these people have been the first superhero team if they really exsisted?"<br /><br />These titans of american fiction all have their special abilities and legendary skills:<br /><br />Alan Quatermain - an excelent exploerer who has a taste for adventure even at an old age.<br /><br />The Invisble man - a creeping sly cat who is stuck in his invisible body until he could find an antidote.<br /><br />Captain Nemo - famous spy who pirates plans and builds massive machinery.<br /><br />Mina Harker - the fabled wife of johnathan harker who has a deep dark secret, a perfect dark ability that strengthens her independent spirit.<br /><br />Dorian Gray - a man with a cursed ability to never die.<br /><br />Tom Sawyer - the adventurous risk-taker who mimics quatermains spirit.<br /><br />Dr. Jekal/ Mr. Hyde - the man and the myth of changing into a massive beast of a man with great strength but a short temper.<br /><br />All of these fictional characters combined makes for a team that is stylishly clever and ready to fit the screen.<br /><br />Together, they unravel the mystery of their newest foe: the Phantom.<br /><br />It sounds like something totally out of the pulp comics but this little concept was made famous by the talented Alan Moore of the popular comic book series.<br /><br />It's worth a look.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

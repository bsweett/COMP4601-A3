<meta name="summary" content="strong performances rescue a predictable script"></head><body><p>United by a common fate, two terminally ill strangers share a room in a hospital and become the best of friends.  Together, they draw up something called a "bucket list," a catalog of things they've always wanted to do in their lives but somehow never got around to doing.  This includes jumping out of an airplane, getting a tattoo, driving a racecar and touring the planet (luckily, one of them is rich enough to own his own jet) - all before "kicking the bucket."<br /><br />Sort of a "feel-good" movie about death, Rob Reiner's "The Bucket List" pretty much plays out as one would expect it to, with a predictable and episodic script (by Justin Zackham) that wobbles uncomfortably between whistling-past-the-graveyard humor and courage-in-the-face-of-death sentimental uplift (the latter being particularly evident in  Morgan Freeman's stentorian voiceover narration and Marc Shaiman's tinkling-piano score).<br /><br />Like the solid professionals they are, Freeman and Jack Nicholson both rise above the cliches of their respective stereotypes: Nicholson's of a gruff, billionaire playboy (true typecasting if ever there was any) who's been successful in all areas of his life except where it really counts, that is to say as a loving husband and father; and Freeman's of a stolid, conservative family man who's never learned to just cut loose and enjoy life to the full.  Now, just as they are about to meet their maker, these two polar opposites get a chance to teach one another valuable lessons on how to make the most of what little time remains to them.<br /><br />All told, there's nothing particularly striking or memorable about "The Bucket List," but the actors make it worth seeing.</p></body></html>

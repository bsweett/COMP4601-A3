<meta name="summary" content="Kansas City Shuffle"></head><body><p>Lucky Number Slevin is a satisfying revenge tale (reminded me of Sleepers a bit) that's told, through flashbacks, editing, and piece-meal revelations, in a way that keeps us guessing about what exactly is going on and who is in on what, until the twist at the end.  Bruce Willis is perfect as "Mr. Goodkat," a world-class hitman who tells us the start of the story - about a family killing 20 years ago - but his own role in it isn't clear until the end, though he appears here and there.  The real protagonist seems to be Josh Hartnett.  He's mistaken for "Nick" and grabbed by thugs who bring him to "The Boss," Morgan Freeman, who insists Nick owes him $96,000, and must kill someone to pay it off.  Before the day is out Hartnett falls in love with Nick's neighbor Lucy Liu and is again abducted by the Boss's rival, Sir Ben Kingsley.  There's a lot of humor in this middle part of the movie, but first and last thirds are intense and violent.  What's amazing is the way it all comes together to a satisfying conclusion that explains everything - which is really all in the story-telling, the way it's put together to let us know the right clues as the story unfolds.  The cast is terrific, with Robert Forster and others, besides those mentioned above. It's not appropriate for kids - too much sex, in addition to considerable violence - but otherwise outstanding.  So what's the Kansas City Shuffle?  You have to see the movie to find out!</p></body></html>

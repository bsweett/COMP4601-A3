<meta name="summary" content="Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson ruin it!"></head><body><p>The only thing I liked about this film was the cameo appearances of the real actors from the "Starsky & Hutch" tv series (ABC, 1975-79), Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00018D3RI">Starsky & Hutch - The Complete First Season</a>.<br /> Looks more like a Zoolander 2.<br /> "Easter Egg" in Special Features: When the yellow star is on Deleted Scenes, Gag Reel or theatrical trailer, press the right button. When the big star is yellow, "click". You will see a Brady Bunch trivia bit with Vince Vaughn and a cop.</p></body></html>

The military has ran out of ideas and every man seems to have a different idea about what to do and where to go. Throughout all this chaos, two S.W.A.T. team members (played by Scott H. Reiniger and the great Ken Foree) meet up with two television station employees (Gaylen Ross and David Emgee) and take shelter in a nearby shopping mall. Despite an incredible amount of the undead population flocking to the mall at an alarming rate, the foursome find salvation in a top-level storage space, and turn what was originally supposed to be a resting stop, into a long-term stay. However, like all societies sooner or later, the one created above the mall full of zombies begins to crumble piece by piece as the movie forges on. All four actors play their roles perfectly, and the characters conflict and compliment each other very well. Director George Romero ("Night Of The Living Dead") is very subtle and lets the story play out naturally. Although his message of anti-consumerism is a bit dated, he still manages to make the movie and the story timeless. Despite the undead being very slow, there is still a thick amount of dread and suspense piled on. There is a reason why Romero is the grandfather of zombie flicks. The zombies aren't the scary part of this movie. What is scary are the people, and how they react to the situation they are faced with, and how quickly society begins to crumble. But it doesn't hurt that special effects master Tom Savini (who, incidentally directed the remake of "Night Of The Living Dead") piles on healthy servings of gore at all the right moments (also, look out for him as the leader of the gang that breaks into the mall). The original "Dawn Of The Dead" is easily one of the best horror movies ever made, and is the rare case of a sequel being just as good as the original. It also works so that if you haven't seen "N.O.T.L.D." you can still watch this and know what's going on. The remake is good, but nothing will ever top this one. This is a movie that will stay in your head for days, and will never ever leave your subconcious. If you're looking for an intelligent and brave horror flick, go to the mall. "Dawn Of The Dead" is highly recommended.</p></body></html>

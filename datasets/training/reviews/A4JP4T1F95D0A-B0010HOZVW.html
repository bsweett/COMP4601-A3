It is fun to watch Foster change into a vigilante, but then it really goes nowhere original with that idea.  The basic plot is that Foster and her husband to be are attacked by thugs in the part.  Foster is beaten severely but survives, her boyfriend is not so lucky and is killed.  Foster then becomes a killing avenger while a divorced good cop slowly starts to piece together the mystery of who is killing all the bad people in New York.  The Blu-ray transfer is good.  A nice crisp clear picture.  I wish the movie were better.  Unless you are a huge Foster fan, this one is a skip.</p></body></html>

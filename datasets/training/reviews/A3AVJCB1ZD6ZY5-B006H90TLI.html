I know Film Appreciation classes try to normalize those answers by giving parameters by which to judge, but I still believe actual answers are as unique as the members of the audience.<br /><br />In my case, greatness is defined by the number of snippets of the individual films that are engraved in your mind. For example, the scene in "Casablanca" where the Germans at Rick's are singing their national anthem and everyone else joins together to sing the French national anthem louder.  I once had the privilege to see "Casablanca" screened at the Paramount in Austin and heard the stillness as the first words in French sounded--then the thundering applause at the end.<br /><br />Add a second quality.  Great films make me think--whether I want to or not.<br /><br />I didn't come out of the theatre this evening with a 5-star rating for "No Country For Old Men."  I sat down twice before this to write the review for this film and walked away.  Now, I'm up at 4:21 AM still considering events and dialogue and I htink I'm ready to write.<br /><br />At the very first, Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) delivers a monologue against a West Texas backdrop.  He's a third-generation lawman who knows of a time when the Sheriffs didn't carry a gun...The times are changing (kids now have green hair and bones in their noses), but he still looks back on that prior generation as a role model.<br /><br />Next, a Texas deputy is in the process of arresting a Hispanic man (Javier Bardem).  The Deputy takes him into the station and calls the Sheriff commenting that the man had an oxygen tank and a hose kind of like someone with emphysema. That deputy was dead wrong.<br /><br />A hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is shooting at some pronghorn deer.  He hits one, but doesn't make the kill shot.  In his search for the wounded animal, he comes across a drug deal gone bad.  Both parties had apparently gone "Wild West" on each other, leaving a pickup bed full of heroin and 2 million dollars in cash in a suitcase.  Moss leaves with the suitcase full of money, but returns later that night to take a drink of water to the only survivor, a Hispanic man. One of the best scenes in that film occurs between Moss and his wife Carla Jean (Kelly McDonald) as he's leaving:<br /><br />Moss:  If I don't come back, tell Mama I love her<br />Carla Jean:  Llewelyn, your Mama's been dead 20 years<br />Moss:  Then I'll tell her myself<br /><br />By the time Moss returned to the scene, the 'corporate people' are looking for the drugs and money. Chigurh killed them, but where's the money?<br /><br />This sets Anton Chigurh (Bardem) on Moss' tail.  He's not just a gangland fix it man, Chigurh may well now be the Energizer Bunny of Sociopathic Killers.  He moves through Texas like a tornado--wreaking havoc wherever he goes, but occasionally whimsically sparing a person.<br /><br />Many reviewers have offered up "No COuntry" as an Oscar contender and I certainly would agree it's a possibility.  Bardem's portrayal of Chigurh is as fascinating as it is hair raising. Brolin and McDonald definitely deserve a nod as supporting cast. McDonald particularly stood up to Bardem very well.<br /><br />I offer up three cautions to people planning on attending this film:<br /><br />1.  Don't attend "No Country" when you're looking for passive entertainment.  Yes, there's plenty of that to be had--but the film is much more than chases and gunfights and you need to be paying attention to understand what's happening.  (I'm planning on going back by myself to review some bits I didn't quite understand)<br /><br />2.  If high violence with concomitant bloodshed and tension are problems for you, be advised that "No Country" is "no film for the squeamish or faint of heart."<br /><br />3.  If you like definitive endings, this is not your film.  On the other hand, if you like to consider the character, the circumstance, and follow the clues--like me, you can come up with a scenario that works for you.  Indeed, "No Country" may be an interesting film to show to a writing class to have students try and write an ending of their own based on the clues.</p></body></html>

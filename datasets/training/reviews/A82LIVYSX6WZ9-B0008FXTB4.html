<meta name="summary" content="Be Cool is not that cool...more like a disappointment really"></head><body><p>Be Cool is the sequel to the 1995 smash hit Get Shorty. John Travolta (Basic, Pulp Fiction, Grease) reprises his tough guy role as Chili Palmer who wants to quit the movie buisness and go into the music business. His friend Tommy, played by James Woods (Diggstown, Scary Movie 2, Virgin Suicides) gets whacked by the Russians. He wants to make Linda Moon, played by singer Christina Milian (Man Of The House '05) a star. So, Chili visits Woods' now widow Edie, played by Uma Thurman (Kill Bill 1 and 2, Pulp Fiction, Tape) so they join together and make this girl big but she has a contract with the rival Nick Carr, played by Harvey Keitel (National Treasure, U571, Pulp Fiction). Keitel's two henchman are played by The Rock (The Rundown, Walking Tall, The Mummy Returns) and Vince Vaughn (upcoming Wedding Crashers, Made, Swingers). Vaughn plays Raji..his real name is Roger...he thinks he's black and The Rock plays Elliott a gay bodyguard who's looking for a bite in the movie business. Cedric The Entertainer (Man Of The House '05, Lemony Snickets, Johnson Family Vacation), Outkast member Andre Benjamin Ice Cold 3000 (Hollywood Homicide), Danny DeVito (Death To Smoochey, Batman Returns), the late Robert Pastorelli (Bait, Eraser, Tv's Murphy Brown), The Black Eyed Peas and Steven Tyler and Aerosmith also star. Cameos by Kobe Bryant, Gene Simmons (of Kiss), Fred Durst (Of Limp Bizkit) and Seth Green (Knockaround Guys, Tv's Buffy and Angel) who plays a music video director named Shotgun. The cast look good especially Thurman but Christina Milian is not the best choice for the role as Linda Moon..I read the book. I didnt like the Music Video awards segment, I thought that was too corny. Vaughn got some of the highlights but he overblows his character way too much. The Rock also had some moments along with Andre Ice Cold 3000 ("Dont give me no gun"). Doesnt give off that much really....could of been better....with a different director...I mean you take a look at Get Shorty and you take a look at Be Cool and sometimes they connect but othertimes they dont. Very, very upsetting for me. Based from Elmore Leonards novel.</p></body></html>

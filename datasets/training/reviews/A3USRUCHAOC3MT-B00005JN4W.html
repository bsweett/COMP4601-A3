That's what composer Michael Ciacchino said the score was about for "The Incredibles".  Director Brad Bird echoed that, saying it was aimed at being a balance of the mundane and the fantastic.  It did a fantastic job at that.<br /><br />This was the first Pixar picture I watched, and I can see why people rave about their animation.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story.  I will admit that I found it interesting the similarity between the foursome and the Fantastic Four (one stretches, one is super-strong, and one is invisible with force fields in both quartets).  I also think it stretched reality a little -- I can imagine the son of a superman type inheriting super-speed, but there is no explanation why a super strong parent and an elastic parent could produce a daughter who turns invisible and throws force fields.  Likewise, if superheroes were out-lawed, what could keep evil supers from running wild?  But when did facts stand in the way of a good story?<br /><br />The story was very entertaining.  It dealt with adult themes in a way that children wouldn't be bored or question something inappropriate.  The writing was great to show human people who just happened to have powers.  It made a great jab at bureauracy being no better than criminals.<br /><br />Also, I enjoyed the James Bond-ish music.  The characters were great as well.<br /><br />Spoiler alert!!!  The rest of this review may ruin some surprises -- read at your own risk!  Also, some of this is my opinion of life in general.<br /><br />The villain, Syndrome, when he was younger, had wanted to be the sidekick for Mr. Incredible, who told him to get lost, that he could handle things on his own.  So Syndrome's plan was to sell superpowers to everyone, and commented "When everybody is super, nobody is super."  Actually, that is the reality.  In a sense, each of us are super, so nobody is better than anyone else.  (My thoughts here.)<br /><br />There is a theme that we are not meant to go about it alone.  If Mr. Incredible has decided to work with "Indrediboy", maybe there would never have been a Syndrome.  In the end, Mr. Incredible learned he was meant to be part of a team, and that team was his family.  We need to realize that this is true of us as well.<br /><br />The alternate beginning drove home the family point.  I think they did the better opening, but I wish they were able to do as the alternate beginning did, and have Helen tell some career woman who looked down on home mothers  the fact that one is no less important than the other.<br /><br />I enjoyed the extra features.  I would have moved the Incrediblunders up on the menu, because a lot of them were shown in the making of the Incredibles.  I was disappointed there was little shown about the voice-actors.  I did find the "essay" by Sarah Vowell (who provided the voice for Violet) intersting, since Vowell and I share interest in the Garfield and McKinley administrations, though I think she would benefit from Toastmasters.</p></body></html>

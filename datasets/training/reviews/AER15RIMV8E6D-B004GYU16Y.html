The character of Salt changes her personality and looks three times, and I couldn't tell what she was supposed to be, because the movie is pretty confusing. In the beginning, she seems like a damsel in distress, and then later she turns into an action star. While interrogating a Russian defector, he mentions that Evelyn Salt is a Russian spy. The CIA believe it to be true, so she escapes and tries to find her husband to make sure he's safe. During the Vice President's funeral, the Russian President will be assassinated unless Salt can stop it. If you like action movies, you might like SALT!!!</p></body></html>

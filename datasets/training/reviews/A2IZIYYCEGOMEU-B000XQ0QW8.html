<meta name="summary" content="POSING THE QUESTION: WHAT IF SUPERHEROES DID EXIST..."></head><body><p>I loved THE SIXTH SENSE, and Shamalayan's take on the possibilities of actual superheroes in our midst ( and our present society's fixation on such an improbability ) in UNBREAKABLE was presented in such a low-key ( some might scoff, and say 'simplistic' ) fashion that one almost wishes that the premise were true. Willis and Jackson as the main protagonists in the film deliver some quite nuanced performances, and the atmospheric camerawork, and subtle ratcheting of tension throughout the film built to a very decent ( and not overtly contrived ) conclusion. If not taken too seriously, UNBREAKABLE is quite engrossing, even thought-provoking, and well worth a second, or even a third viewing. Good stuff.</p></body></html>

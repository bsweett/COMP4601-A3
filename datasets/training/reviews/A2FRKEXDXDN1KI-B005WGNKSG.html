<meta name="summary" content="DVD: Magnificent film, awesome performance, cinematography.  A little skimpy on special features though."></head><body><p>Stieg Larsson is known in Sweden for his contribution to sci-fi fandom but to the outside world, he is known posthumously for his "Millennium" trilogy especially with the novel "M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor (Men who hate women)" aka "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo", the first novel of the trilogy and a novel based on manuscripts by Larsson written  but unpublished until after his death in 2004.<br /><br />In 2008, Larsson became the second best-selling author in the world and the trilogy had sold 27 million copies in more than 40 countries.<br /><br />In 2009, the film received its Swedish adaptation and the film which was created for $13 million would go on to earn $102 million worldwide and now a US version based on the novel has been greenlighted and currently, casting for the film is now being done in the US.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" looks very good on DVD.  The cinematography by Jens Fischer and Eric Kress is well-done.  The various shots throughout Sweden during the various scenes of daylight, night, snow and heavy rain was well-captured.  I didn't notice any compression artifacts or any major PQ problems.  Personally, I was impressed by the cinematography that I actually am looking forward in picking this film up on Blu-ray and watching it via HD.  It's a stunning film that the director and cinematographers really did a wonderful job in bringing Stieg Larsson's novel to life.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is presented in Swedish Dolby Digital 5.1 and an English 5.1 Dolby Digital dub.  I watched the film in its original Swedish presentation with English subtitles and the audio is very well-done.  Great use of crowd and hardware ambiance, music and various action scenes that utilize the surround channels.  Audio is clear and understandable and I actually would have love to hear the lossless soundtrack for this film on Blu-ray.  But people who are curious about the Swedish track should know that it is clear.<br /><br />As for the English dub, I prefer not too watch dubs but my wife does and I watched a little bit with the English dialogue and its well done.  The good news is that the dub track is not by American's trying to be Swedish which is good news and that the dub actors due have a slight accent.<br /><br />But for both audio tracks, we vouch for the audio tracks that we listened to.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Interview with Noomi Rapace - (12:30) An English interview with actress Noomi Rapace (who plays Lisabeth) who talks about playing the role of Lisbeth and enjoying the original novel and what preparation was done to transform to the character of Liabeth and the pressures she felt in playing this major role.<br />  * Theatrical Trailer - (1:43) The English dubbed theatrical trailer for "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo".<br />  * The Vanger Family Tree - A graphic showing the Vanger Family Tree.<br />  * TGWPWF Preview - (1:25) An English preview of the second film in the "Millennium" trilogy, "The Girl Who Played With Fire".<br />  * Previews - Music Box Film Trailers<br /><br />JUDGMENT FILM:<br /><br />My first foray into "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" came from my wife.  Her family members have loved the novels and my wife was going crazy reading all three novels and then watching the film.  She has told me many times to read the novels in the trilogy but with so many books in my reading queue, I figured, why not see what the hype is all about and watch this film for myself.<br /><br />And as I watched "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", I was drawn in by the performances of Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.  Their performance was magnificent, as was the cinematography by Jens Fishcer and Eric Kress.  Just the amount of footage shot in various weather conditions and locations was quite impressive but most of all, bringing the novel to life (as my wife would say).<br /><br />This film was not only suspenseful but it literally sent chills down my spine.  The film is not for the weak at heart when it comes to violence and torture.  The film has many graphic moments of people who have been murdered, people who have been raped and I'm not going to sugarcoat things... this film is violent.<br /><br />But the film is also a suspenseful, haunting thriller that not only grabs your attention, you literally root for these characters that are completely opposite but they take you on an amazing ride with quite a bit of twists and turns along the way.  I have no problems saying that "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is one of the best modern suspense films that I have watched in long while.  And I'm talking about overall acting, cinematography, pacing and how well the story is conceived.  It's a fantastic film!<br /><br />So far, a lot of the reviews haven been quite positive for this film.  Those who have read the novel have had positive feelings while some have a hard time with the casting choices.<br /><br />Duane Dudek of the Journal Sentinel writes, "The lead character, a crusading journalist, looks older and seems duller, and the title character, an anti-social computer hacker wearing a spiked dog collar and black lipstick, seems as if she belongs in a vampire movie. And the story that was so compelling on the page, about the disappearance of a teenage girl 40 years earlier, feels simplified and literal."<br /><br />Personally, these characters are what I loved about the film.  The character of Mikael Blomkvist is an experienced writer who is taking on a billionare and now having to face a serious libel charge that he libeled him due to false information he was given.  I just don't see this part going to a younger talent.  Considering the US version has hired 007 actor Daniel Craig to play Blomkvist, the more seasoned writer than is very astute, observational and wise made Michael Nyqvist perfect for the role.  And Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth was a wonderful casting choice.  To see her as an anti-social, goth-like computer hacker brought another dimension to this film.  I literally can't picture anyone but someone from the underground and also different from the norm in playing the role.<br /><br />Since I haven't read the novel, I don't know how much detail was left out but for the most part, this is one of the few instances where I felt the longer duration has helped the film (where so many filmmakers abuse the longer duration for a film and sometimes lose sight of what made their film so entertaining with banal scenes).  Personally, I didn't feel the story was simplified but having read a variety of those who felt it was a solid adaptation and others who felt that the book was better, it's all subjective.<br /><br />If there was one subject that I feel may touch a nerve with viewers is a rape scene (well, actually there are others who have been raped and tortured) but there is one graphic scene that may turn people off.  I for one, dislike disturbing scenes like this in a film especially if was done for shock value.  In the case of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", although a film that contains a lot of violence, I felt that the violence was not gratuitous and was appropriate to the story but again, this is subjective as I've read those who felt it was appropriate and others who felt it was bit too much for their taste.<br /><br />As for the DVD, the DVD doesn't come with a lot of special features but the interview with Noomi Rapace was quite interesting to watch and see how she dealt with playing the character and seeing how the public had felt about her performance.  Also, it was cool to see the trailer for the second film which I really look forward too. But I wish there was an audio commentary track, featurette and more interviews.<br /><br />Personally, as much as I enjoyed the DVD version, I now want the Blu-ray version.  The cinematography was just great as was the audio that I want to watch this movie in HD and also hear it in lossless audio.  If you are debating between both Blu-ray and DVD, I'll tell you right now, go with the Blu-ray version because a movie this good, demands to be seen on Blu!<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is a fantastic film featuring an awesome performance by the talent, a chilling screenplay adaptation and wonderful cinematography and music.  It's a film that will no doubt send shivers towards your spine but you will feel that you are captured by the film by the solid performances courtesy of Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.  These two were absolutely wonderful.  I know there is a US version coming out soon but personally, the Swedish film was done exceptionally well and both the Blu-ray and the DVD comes with the Swedish and dubbed English soundtrack.  But I just hope that the US version of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" doesn't become another film that joins the list of horrible US remakes.<br /><br />Overall, I absolutely loved this film and if you have not watched this film yet, I absolutely recommend one putting this on their must-buy list for 2010.  "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is highly recommended!</p></body></html>

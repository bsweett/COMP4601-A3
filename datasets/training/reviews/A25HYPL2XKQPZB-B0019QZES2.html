<meta name="summary" content="Good entertainment...but nothing original"></head><body><p>Meet the Fockers is a solid sequel to the Ben Stiller starring Meet the Parents.  In the sequel, Greg (Stiller) must bring his future wife and her family to Florida to meet his parents played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand.<br /><br />Meet the Fockers is more of the first movie, with Greg trying to keep his parents from totally embarassing him in front of his conservative, uptight future inlaws.  With so many stars in this movie, Striesand and Blythe Danner don't get as much to do.  De Niro's character does the exact same things as the first movie.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman is really the star of this movie.  He is the focus of almost every scene and is definitely the acting equal of DeNiro.  And am I the only one to notice...What happened to Teri Polo.  In some scenes, she looked kind of creepy, not anywhere close to the cute girl in the first movie.<br /><br />Meet the Fockers is a fun movie to watch, but is basically an extension of the first movie and offers nothing new except solid laughs.</p></body></html>

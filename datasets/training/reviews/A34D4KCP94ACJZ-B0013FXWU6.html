<meta name="summary" content="The Best Film of 2007"></head><body><p>Some people have already hailed this as a masterpiece topping nearly all films in history.  I saw one recent list of the greatest movies ever made that put There Will be Blood as number two, following only <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W0WM">Casablanca</a>.  Perhaps that kind of message is somewhat consistent with the film's themes of false prophets and capitalist hype.  Time will tell if this movie deserves that kind of glorious praise I suppose, but I will agree without a shadow of a doubt that among the many tall trees in 2007, There Will be Blood is the tallest.  It is an astounding achievement and P.T. Anderson (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAAJZ6">Boogie Nights</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAAJYW">Magnolia</a>) has officially settled into all of his massive potential.  He had not made a movie in five years but has always shown flashes of brilliance.<br /><br />There Will be Blood is apparently based to some degree on the Upton Sinclair novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0141031700">Oil!</a>.  The movie tells the tale of a silver miner named Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) who stumbles upon oil deposits in one of his mines.  The first part of the film shows us how he gradually refines his drilling techniques and how he eventually creates a massively successful oil enterprise.  One of his expeditions into a small town suspected of having vast oil reserves is framed in greater detail and introduces us to Eli (Paul Dano), a faith healer and head of the Church of the Third Revelation.  Many other significant stories involving Plainview's adopted son and a half-brother he didn't know he had, also portray the moral dilemmas he faces, but it is his dance with Eli that is more fascinating and layered than many cinematic conflicts I can think of.  Blind faith and devotion, whether it be in God or money, so easily devolve to greed, dishonesty, and self-destruction.  This is a dark movie with an incredibly powerful screenplay.<br /><br />Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead put together the music and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XA50MK">soundtrack</a> is as effective as we've come to expect from a P.T. Anderson movie, as is the first rate cinematography from Anderson partner Robert Elswit, who has put together a wonderful career even outside of Anderson's movies.  However, stylistically this is restrained by comparison to Anderson's earlier films and I actually think it serves to make the film far more effective.  Almost everyone loves the hip booming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002UKO">soundtrack</a> and Tarantino-esque dialogue of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAAJZ6">Boogie Nights</a>,  but it would not have worked in a serious film like this, and Anderson seems to have grown out of caring about that sort of thing.  Good for him, I really enjoyed forgetting I was watching a movie and instead stepping into the cutthroat world of Daniel Plainview for two and a half hours.<br /><br />The one element of this film that will be remembered in the annals of cinematic history is of course the Oscar winning, and more than Oscar worthy, performance of Daniel Day Lewis.  This guy is never less than great in anything he has ever done and seems to come out of seclusion every three to five years or so to show the rest of the world what acting really is.  I'm hard-pressed to think of a performance that is definitely better than this one.  He is a remarkable and gifted actor, and showcases that here more than anywhere else.  On the other hand, I think Paul Dano's performance will be overlooked.  The young actor was highly praised in many circles for his performance in 2006's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHQE">Little Miss Sunshine</a>, a dramatically different performance in a dramatically different movie, but here is even better and is definitely one to look out for.<br /><br />There Will be Blood offers great visuals, great performances, and significant insights that some viewers may be sensitive to.  I felt a subtle contemporary social commentary that points to overwhelming hypocrisies happening in our modern world.  I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.</p></body></html>

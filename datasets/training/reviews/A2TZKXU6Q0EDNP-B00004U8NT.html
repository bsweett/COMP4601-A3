<meta name="summary" content="Withstood the test of time...And who said this is sci-&quot;fi&quot;?"></head><body><p>It had been years since I had watched this film and i wanted to see whether it would have the same impact on me as it when i saw it almost 20 years ago.<p>  Perhaps unsurprisingly it was every bit as intimidating, eerie, and tremendously entertaining as it was back then.<p>  Ask any UFO buff and he/she'll tell you that when it comes to films about the &quot;objects in the sky&quot; there are very few, extremely few, that can demand good notes from the audiences.<br />  &quot;Close encounters&quot; is definately one of them, a film that despite a near 30 yrs after its release it still jumps at you (small screen or big) and is at the same time thought provoking.<p>  Spielberg has some tremendous (especially at the box office) hits under his belt but in the minds of many this might be one of his very best films. If not the best.<p>  As &quot;they&quot; arrive with lightning-speed craft that cruise the skies of a small american town, scanning and patroling while getting the attention of every local in sight it seems like a collective obsession takes over the residents and the viewers together.<p>  What do they want? Who are they? <p>  The questions, the fear, the immense intimidation, the complications and the implications come through in brilliant manner through all the characters that parade through this classic film.<p>  But what still impresses is that &quot;Close encounters&quot; manages to remain intelligent even if you see it today. That might sound<br />like a moot point to those that love this film but it's a legitimate point. Spielberg doesnt ridicule the issue, doesnt attempt to offer some laughable debunking, doesnt dismiss it, but instead takes it full-on with the seriousness it demands.<br />  And even when the film has its funny moments the focus isnt lost for a single second.<p>  All the more wowing is the fact that effects still look pretty damn good and i saw it in my small living room TV. Sure, it might reek of that 70s aura all along but that's inevitable and it really doeasn't come across as annoying, if anything that even adds to the charm.<p>  Funny and certinaly bizzare that I havent seen a good film with this theme in a long, long while, unless we consider braindead disasters like &quot;Independence day&quot; contenders.<br />  This is why i picked up to the DVD and the reward factor was immense.<br />  The extra features on this limited edition disc are seriously interesting as well.<br />  Way up there with the cinematic classics regardless of genre. If you havent seen this check it out.<br />  Timeless stuff.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The DUKE and PAPPY at the top of their game!  5stars aren't enough!!!"></head><body><p>I am laughing at John Milius' marvelous comments on the feature on disc 2..."For people to say that John Wayne isn't a good actor is the stupidest thing in  the world...all you have to do is show "the  Searchers"!  Richard Schickel also says of Wayne's performance that it is as good as any in  the history of film.<br /><br />Obviously by the title of my review ...I agree...and its a great story...incredibly directed by John Ford ....the greatest of all directors and everything from the casting to cinematography is perfect.<br /><br />THE DVD set is also wonderful.. the movie LOOKS GREAT for any age much less a 50 year old print.  THe VIstaVision print  is stunning!  On disc 2 there is a wealth of goodies...the new featurette (around 30 minutes) is terrific as is the previously released feature on the film with marvelous commentary by Patrick Wayne ,  John  Milius and others...and to round  things out...several WB making  ofs...which were "teasers" of the day.<br /><br />THE ONLY downer is the 1minute plus preview for JESSE JAMES ..starring Brad Pitt. As a lover of western's I'll probably catch it but the 1minute preview doesn't deserve the STICKER on the front of this package touting its inclusion...geez...to buy this 2 DVD set for THAT preview..well ..that's as stupid as saying John Wayne isn't a good actor!<br /><br />ENJOY...there is plenty here to spend time with..OH ,  and Peter Bogdonavichs audio commentary on the  film is typically first rate!!!</p></body></html>

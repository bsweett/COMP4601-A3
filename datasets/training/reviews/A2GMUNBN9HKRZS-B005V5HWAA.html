<meta name="summary" content="The voice in the back seat"></head><body><p>This is a most clever murder mystery thing, with enough surprises and twists to keep you glued to your lazy boy. John Hurt is always a pleasure, and he gets to dig in deep into a very different character. It's good to see Kevin Costner in a subdued but powerful role. Demi Moore  has a role where she can "act out" as a trait of her character, something she is good at. This fim is enjoyable and intriguing.</p></body></html>

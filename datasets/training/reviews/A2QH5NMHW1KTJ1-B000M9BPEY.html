Before I hit the theater, I know the movie was going to be a father and son one.....,but a weird one. The imagination of Tim Burton has been captured on film for all his films. The way he makes the movie all dark, and just....amazing at the same time is amazing. He is like one of my favorite director of all time, Better than Spielberg. This is a father and son movie and I would understand if someone cried during the film. I felt like crying. This is like the first really great fairy tale in year's...!!! What surprised me the most is that Rogert Ebert hated this film. As which Richard Roeper liked it. I guess Ebert got a little nuts since Siskels gone. Don't listen to Ebert, listen to Roeper.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="(4.5 STARS) Meeting with People to Fire Them: Intelligent Drama with a Serious Theme"></head><body><p>According to the tagline of the film, "Up in the Air" is about "The story of a man ready to make a connection." The irony is that Ryan Bingham, our protagonist, is a corporate downsizer, a man traveling across the country to fire employees. He is hired by their employers who would rather not see them in person. He spends his days traveling around the country to meet people he knows he will never see again.<br /><br />"Up in the Air" is a comedy drama, but its subject matter is immediate and very serious. Another irony of the film is that Ryan Bingham, the corporate downsizer ready to make a connection, is played by George Clooney, one of Hollywood's most likable stars. In fact Ryan, always efficient and professional, is able to charm his way through life. Ryan is so confident, and perhaps he should be, though we are aware that behind the amusing (and satirical) sketches of him there is something missing in his life.<br /><br />Things get more complicated for him when Ryan meets two women: Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga), an enigmatic frequent flyer Ryan sleeps with, and Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), his ambitious coworker selling her own idea to Ryan's boss Craig (Jason Bateman): firing people through the Internet and video camera. Obviously Ryan's life is about to change, but can he really connect to other people? Or what does he want in his life?<br /><br />Having seen "Thank You for Smoking" and "Juno," I think Jason Reitman is one of the most talented directors of his generation. He turns controversial issues into drama with humor and thought-provoking challenges for viewers. He knows the right way to do it. You may not like what his characters are doing - and they often do it with confidence - but you definitely care them, or are at least interested in them and their life.<br /><br />Not everything is perfect, I admit. Though her acting is fine, Anna Kendrick's character (her back story about the boyfriend, for instance) doesn't really convince. The story is told with good pace, but some part of it is a bit familiar, and charming Melanie Lynskey is sadly underused. Still "Up in the Air" is an intelligent comedy drama with one serious theme, bolstered by superb acting from the three leads, George Clooney, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick.</p></body></html>

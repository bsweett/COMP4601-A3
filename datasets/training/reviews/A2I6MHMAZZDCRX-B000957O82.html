<meta name="summary" content="You'll Fall in Love with This Movie"></head><body><p>Alex Hitchens, "Hitch" to his friends (Will Smith), has a wonderful job.  He helps men get the women of their dreams by giving them dating tips and arranging situations where they can meet their current crushes.  Dubbed the "Date Doctor," Hitch operates by word of mouth.<br /><br />His latest client is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), a nerdy accountant who is deeply in love with socialite Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta).  Even though Albert is way out of Allegra's league, Hitch begins to work his magic.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Hitch has met society columnist Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) and is doing his best to win her.  Sara is a tough cookie to crack, however, because her job reporting the break ups of others has made her extremely cynical.  Sara's pursuit of Allegra and Albert only makes things worse.  Will anyone find true love?<br /><br />I'm sure if I describe this romantic comedy as predictable, it won't come as any surprise to you.  I had the ultimate ending figured out long before the story really got going.  However, I was left wondering how exactly they'd reach that outcome.<br /><br />Even more importantly, the journey along the way was fun.  While I didn't laugh as much as my friends, I was often smiling when I wasn't cringing.  I'm not a fan of comedy from embarrassment, and that's some of the humor here.  However, watching Hitch in action is fun.  He is so smooth it is remarkable.<br /><br />Finally, the characters made me care about the outcome.  Sara was the only one it was hard to warm up to, and by the end I cared for her, too.  The acting was great, which really helped.<br /><br />This is one of those rare romantic comedies that everyone seems to enjoy.  So if you are looking for a light film, give this one a chance.</p></body></html>

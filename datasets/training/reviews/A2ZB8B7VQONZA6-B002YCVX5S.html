So of course when this film was released I had to go see it and the second it was out on DVD/BLU-RAY I had to own it. I knew from the moment this film was announced that it would be another QT classic with out a doubt. Say what you will but it was a major success and you can't discount that at all. I of course knew that I would love this film and of course I did. Call me a Fanboy or what ever but I really did enjoy the film being a QT fan or not.<br /><br />QT had been writing this film for years and was looking to make this one of his best films ever, I think he did just that. Yes there is another film by this name that QT is a big fan of but this is not the same film. I do however recommend seeing that film because it is another fun one. Any way this film has been in the works long before it was released and I think the time spent on it shows. And for those who have for some reason yet to see this film it is not just about that naughty group of American soldiers who go by the films title. No in fact it tells the story of a group of different people who some how or some way all get brought together some how at some point.<br /><br />The film follows of course The Basterds lead by Lt. Aldo Raine [Pitt] in their quest to punish and destroy Nazis across the land. Along with Jewish American soldiers like the Bear Jew [Eli Roth] and even German recruits [you will love one guy]. But others like the brilliant Colonel Hans Landa aka the Jew Hunter [played wonderfully by Christoph Waltz] and Shosanna who later becomes Emmanuelle Mimieux [M&eacute;lanie Laurent]. Add in a film star named Bridget von Hammersmark [Diane Kruger] and a German war hero Frederick Zoller [Daniel Br&uuml;hl] and you have a great film.<br /><br />The film is basically told like a book kinda broke into 5 chapters each continuing the story and bringing them all together at the same time. The first one is set in 1941 while the rest take place in 1944, but rest assured nothing seems out of place at all with the time jump. The chapters are 1.Once Upon a Time in Nazi Occupied France, 2.Inglourious Basterds, 3.German Night in Paris, 4.Operation Kino, and the explosive 5.Revenge of the Giant Face. Every chapter in my opinion is absolutely perfect. The first one is the introduction of the Jew Hunter in one of the best scenes in the film followed by chapter two which is the introduction of The Basterds. The third one is were we catch up with Shosanna who is now Emmanuelle and her admirer war hero Frederick. Chapter four shows us the actress and her plan to infiltrate a planned Nazi gathering for a film premiere. And finally the grand finish which I will not ruin for those who have yet to see it, excellent.<br /><br />Tarantino has always been known to have great dialogue in his films and this one follows suit, the film is with out a doubt a QT film. The direction is flawless in my humble opinion and how could it be anything less. The cinematography is beautiful and the score is excellent as well, the perfect film is coming together. But it is the performances here that really are great with every one doing a great job. Christoph Waltz is the show stealer as the Jew Hunter and rightfully won the Oscar for Supporting Actor. He is with out a doubt the best thing about this film from the acting stand point and that is really saying something.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is absolutely hilarious in this film is probably the most fun one in the film with the accent and attitude he showcases in the film. All of the Basterds are excellent in this film as one would expect and that includes filmmaker Eli Roth as the Bear Jew. M&eacute;lanie Laurent and Diane Kruger are wonderful in the two female leads for the film as QT has always been able to write strong female characters. Each one is a totally different character with a different life and style but they are more the same then they seem. Martin Wuttke is excellent as Hitler and who could disagree with that, he is hilarious with his little hair bouncing up and down and flopping every were when he is mad.<br /><br />Daniel Br&uuml;hl is also very well cast in the film as a Nazi war hero turned actor who has a thing for M&eacute;lanie Laurent's character. These two are great together and deliver one of the best scenes in the film. Also August Diehl is great in the one scene he is in as a German officer who may or may not be on to our heroes. The fact is every one in this film from the smallest part to the biggest are excellent in this film. I would highly recommend this film especially if you like great acting. Also Lawrence Bender returns as the producer for QT, just one more reason to get this. Go but this film now it is worth much more than a rental. The two disc special edition has some wonderful features from behind the scenes to the film within the film [the war heroes' film]. gotta love that Mike Myers cameo.<br /><br />I waited a long time to see this film and with what was happening in my life around this time I needed an escape.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A little disappointed"></head><body><p>Well I thought this would be a horror movie for one thing. The previews showed nothing but a girl going out of her mind and going insane from the demons taking over her body. Well that's only about a half hour of the movie. The rest of the movie is courtroom mumbo jumbo. It's bad enough all my wife watches is Law and Order and every CSI, but when I want to watch a horror movie, I don't want to see more courtroom babble. This is not your daddy's Exorcist.<br /><br />The movie was well acted and the girl that played Emily did a great job, but there just wasn't enough to keep me interested. For a movie about a young girl being possessed, the movie is more about the defense attorney who defends the priest who is charged with criminal manslaughter or negligence or something. I'm sorry but it takes more than a lawyer waking up at 3:00 AM and discovering her front door is unlocked to frighten me.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is when the exorcism is being performed and the climatic part out in the barn when the demon finally admits he is the same demon that possessed Cain and Nero.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this DVD at the pawn shop for next to nothing. Like I said I was expecting a horror movie. This movie could barely get a 13 year old girl scared.</p></body></html>

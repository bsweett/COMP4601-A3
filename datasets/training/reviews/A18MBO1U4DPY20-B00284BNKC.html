<meta name="summary" content="Emotional Sickness"></head><body><p>I am not weak and I like movies that can emote remote depressive feelings in me. Somehow this movie with absolutely impacting dark nature didnt manage to entertain me. Sometimes our sub conscious mind exerts extreme nightmares on our brain and there are times when we feel we just came out of the worst feeling ever.<br /><br />I have once felt the same feeling of drowning within yourself and yet everything being more unreal than comprehension. I have not seen a more dark film in my life. The best way to describe it is "black" owing to its extreme....<br /><br />A certain character in the film rots in the worst way. A fridge can be extreme torture. I really felt emotionally sick while watching those scenes. However  I somehow could not contain myself in that period of time where I saw the film.<br /><br />PLEASE READ:<br /><br />However I noticed a lot of people liked this film but in my (not)humble opinion, watch this if you know what addiction can do and are willing to see something of as dark nature as this.<br /><br />Enjoy what works</p></body></html>

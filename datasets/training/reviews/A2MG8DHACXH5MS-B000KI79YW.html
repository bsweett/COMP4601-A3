<meta name="summary" content="Agent Jack Bauer on the Big Screen"></head><body><p>Kiefer Sutherland's Toronto gets a feature when the American President is almost taken down near City Hall. Keifer Sutherland is one of the best sleuths with the American Secret Service. His former best friend and mentor is having an affair with the First Lady and now framed for attempted treason. While Douglas tries to clear his name... the Secret Service must heighten efforts to protect the Commander in Chief.  Sure its Agent Bauer from 24 on the big screen but it's cool to see a rouge agent break into the Metro Toronto Police Headquarters just by flashing his badge despite a US Federal Warrant out for his capture.</p></body></html>

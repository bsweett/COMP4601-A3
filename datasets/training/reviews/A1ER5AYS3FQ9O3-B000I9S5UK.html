<meta name="summary" content="Why this was made...and whether it is worth seeing"></head><body><p>WHY THEY MADE IT:<br />1. THe original Assault on Precinct 13 was made in 1976 so there might be a fair number of people out there who hadn't seen the original, many of them age 30 or under (a desirable demographic)<br />2. The formula worked the first time around and Hollywood likes proven successes.<br /><br />IS IT WORTH SEEING?:<br />1. For fans of Ethan Hawke, definitely.Credible work.<br />2. For everyone else, rent or buy the first movie before you see this one. If the subject matter interests you ( a precinct being shut down and attacked by bad guys), you might want to take a look at the remake because there are enough differences to hold your attention.</p></body></html>

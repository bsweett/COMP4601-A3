<meta name="summary" content="Good film."></head><body><p>I really wasn't sure what to expect from this movie.<br />I had heard about it for years but I still wasn't entirely sure what it was about.<br />Was it a comedy or a documentary style movie?<br />It turned out to be a very dark comedy.<br />A somewhat unrealistic comedy but still a good one.<br />Aaron Eckhart is the big tobacco lobbyist who is trying to convince the government and the public that smoking isn't bad for you.<br />He's divorced, and pretty much a dirt bag.<br />That said the movie has excellent acting.<br />Pacing is spot on.<br />Pretty much everything was done well.<br />I recommend a rental.</p></body></html>

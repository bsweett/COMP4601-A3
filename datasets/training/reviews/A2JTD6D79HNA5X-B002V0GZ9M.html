I guess  that part is not factored in or people have not seen enough films. Well, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves once again worked well together and did a great job in this film. So she's in 2006 and he's in 2004 and they keep trying to meet. Thought what they do keep impacting each others lifes and they send letters to each other through the mailbox at the lakehouse which he is living in at the moment. It's confusing but if you do what others do and just pretend to not notice it and just deem it cute, then you will enjoy it no doubt. I liked the film in general but the plot is confusing. I even wonder if Sandra and Keanu knew what was going on half the time.</p></body></html>

In the tradition of WHAT LIES BENEATH and GOTHIKA it makes for an entertaining ride.  Keep in mind, however, there is a difference between a horror movie & a ghost story.<br /><br />As with all Jennifer Connelly movies, the best feature of this one is........er........Jennifer Connelly.  She's my favorite actress and she could make a bad movie look good.  She can also make a good movie better, which she does here.  For all I care, Jennifer Connelly could become the supreme commander of the universe and I would greet the news with enthusiasm!<br /><br />As for the story, it is rather slow moving.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but don't watch this one expecting things to be constantly happening.  One of the biggest differences between a ghost story & horror film is suspense.  Ghost stories tend to have a lot of it, whereas horror flicks have little or no suspense.<br /><br />If you like  Jennifer Connelly and / or ghost themes, this one is worth checking out.  Besides Connelly, the rest of the supporting cast is quite good also.</p></body></html>

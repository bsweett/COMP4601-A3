<meta name="summary" content="A love affair with the universe:The Life and Death of Christopher McCandless"></head><body><p>The true story of Christopher McCandless, a young man who leaves a hefty scholarship to Emory U.in 1992 puts a new face on the old saying,"Go West,young man,go West!"<br /> Sean Penn has taken Jon Krakauer's book and boiled it down to one theme: the finding of self-knowledge through forsaking all.Not since St.Francis of Assisi left all his wealth and familial bonds to serve Christ in  BROTHER SUN,SISTER MOON has come a film where one man leaves all,not to follow Christ in this case, but to undertake his own "spiritual journey" as he experiences life with nature and people on his way to Alaska.<br />Emile Hirsch is so perfect in this role,that his charm and innocence are refreshing.Hirsch IS McCandless or "Alexander Supertramp" as he knights himself.The film is told from several perspectives:McCandless',his sister's (Jena Malone) and his parents (an amazing Marcia Gay Harden and stoic ol'William Hurt).Everyone is affected by Chris' decision.Penn shows us from what Chris is running from and to where he is running which will eventually lead to his death.Between those polar opposites,is a heartfelt tale of a man in love with the universe.That's not a spoiler.It was a well known newspaper fact when this story broke.Still we will root all the way as Chris tries to survive over 100 days in wilderness alone.He will lose, but we will win from an example well set by a young idealist who "grabbed all the gusto" and "went out in a blaze of glory!"<br />The film clocks in in over two-and-a-half hours,so hunker down for an interesting journey INTO THE WILD.<br />Also starring Catherine Keener,Vince Vaughn (a surprising excellent performance) and Hal Holbrook as an old "leather tramp" named Ron.It is Holbrook's role, though, that is the real pro-acting of this film.It's a small role, but the noms will come.</p></body></html>

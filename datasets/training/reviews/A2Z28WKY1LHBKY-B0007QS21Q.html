Never compare a movie with a book: they're different animals. This was an interesting film, although there is little doubt that mankind is actually on the high road to dehumanisation. That's why there was no sex, not much gore, only three human deaths, more hardware than software, and why Smith was a quarter robot himself. At one point I thought he was a robot through and through; and might even have been the mastermind behind the whole set-up. But no, it all turned out right in the end. Reassuring for the kids. Good fun, but not very memorable. Five stars for the sfx and the cgi; and Smith was good as Spooner.</p></body></html>

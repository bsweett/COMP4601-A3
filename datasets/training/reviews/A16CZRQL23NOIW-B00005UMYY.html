<meta name="summary" content="The fragmented memory supported by backward glances!"></head><body><p>The memory is selectively greedy. The overall amount of the selected repertoire depends of you and your personal bliss.<br /><br />This powerful and challenging Noir has to do with a simple question: what about you or me if suddenly the lights of the memory simply turn off? What if your capacity to remember is no longer than five minutes?<br /><br />The dramatic and awful premise: a horrid murder and a serious cerebral damage will make your name still persists but your entire life since that moment will be a total mess, a complicated puzzle of photographs, annotations, addresses, footnotes, faces, false names are the lost fragments product of a bloody explosion, that has caused a true virulent disorder of the vital synapses, reduced to occasional flashes.<br /><br />A man without memory will become a desperate man; he needs to belong a country, be part of a community, for love and be loved and so nourish his imagination,  to expand his intelligence and so  to learn and grow up. On the other hand a man with just a memory becomes a modern Faust. Between these two extremes, this anguished man will desperately seek the origin of his emotional wounds to restore a minimum of necessary equilibrium.<br /><br />This striking film - supported by a breathtaking script - integrates an astonishing and fundamental Quartet of golden movies: Twelve monkeys, Dark city and Mulholland drive.</p></body></html>

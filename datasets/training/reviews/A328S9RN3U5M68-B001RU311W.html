<meta name="summary" content="A Splendid and Important Film"></head><body><p>MILK is one of the more powerful bio-epics produced by Hollywood.  Harvey Milk, the man honored by this superbly crafted film by writer Dustin Lance Black and directed by Gus Van Sant, is brought to life by Sean Penn in his most skilled performance of his fine career.  Not only is this movie an homage to Harvey Milk, but it is also a shaking reminder of the ferocious ongoing battle for Civil Rights.  Few viewers will come away from this  film untouched.<br /><br />The life of gay activist Harvey Milk is well known, as is his assassination as he finally reached a platform where his voice could be heard.  Black and Van Zant have wisely started the story with some black and white footage of the abuse of the gay population across the country and then ease into the biography by showing us Milk in New York, approaching his 40th birthday and  discovering Scott Smith (James Franco) as the beginning of not only a  tender partnership but also a change in Milk's drive to make a difference.  The climb to importance from his migration to Castro Street in San Francisco and the 'recruiting' of his clan (Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones et al) and the struggles he faced in gaining acceptance of a minority group is the stuff of legends.<br /><br />Penn is extraordinary, but Franco, Hirsch, Josh Brolin  as Milk's assassin, and Diego Luna as the kinky Jack Lira turn in excellent performances.  Van Zant is unafraid to show the tenderness among his characters: it is satisfying to see prominent male actors take on roles that include same sex intimacy.  This is a film that deserves to enter the archives as one of the 'greats.'  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, March 09</p></body></html>

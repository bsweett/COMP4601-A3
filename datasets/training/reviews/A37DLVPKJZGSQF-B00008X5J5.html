<meta name="summary" content="Rich, lovely and entertaining animated feature."></head><body><p>Sleeping Beauty is one of the most original Disney movies to come out ever, no contest. The way the story strings itself together with such clean cleverness assures that this is some of the most masterful storytelling ever put to animation. It's a tremendous, stunning musical with songs to delight the heart and dreamy forest sets and thrilling medievil battles. The film will have you holding on to your pillow in the suspense scenes and have you heart tickled in the romantic loveliness. Every plot point is used no matter what, and even when some scenes are either annoying or slightly boring, that doesn't stop Sleepy Beauty from being an endlessly watchable, spellbindingly fun film for the entire family or just you and your cat.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An classic horror movie that remains genuinely disturbing, 25 years after its release."></head><body><p>We figured we might as well start out with the iconic religious horror film, The Exorcist. While some horror movies become dated over time, this one retains its bite even after 25 years; the fears it plays upon are still strong, unlike movies that focus on atomic war. The plotline also is representative of a common sub-genre within religious horror--the disillusioned priest who regains his faith through extreme trials in which scholarship and science fail. The cold, clinical scientists do nothing but cause Regan enormous fear and pain, with no relief; only faith and religion can save her. It is a trial, but a trial worth struggling through, and a trial that is brought upon purely out of a desire to free Regan from the horrors that inhabit her, not scientific curiousity. An interesting commentary on science, religion, and faith, as well as a genuinely scary movie even without new-fangled sfx!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Americanized Audition"></head><body><p>Have you ever seen that internet video of bird getting eaten by the (ninja) turtle?  Or the one where the octopus eats the shark?  In nature, we all have preconceived notions about roles of weakness and strength during confrontation.  The same holds true for humanity, which is why we love an underdog.  Hard Candy flips that concept on its head, sociopathically displaying that the concepts of predator and prey are interchangeable.<br /><br />When Jeff (Patrick Wilson), a 32-year old photographer, begins chatting online with precocious 14-year old Haley (Ellen Page), the interaction has every indication of something creepy; the situation is just wrong.  When they meet up for coffee, an uneasiness exudes from every table, chair, and fiber of their surroundings.  After some conversation in which Haley displays a maturity and intellect rivaling Jeff, the two make their way back to Jeff's apartment; it's difficult to ascertain who persuades whom.<br /><br />Foreboding and disturbing, the setting quickly illustrates how easily an adult could take advantage of a child; and when alcohol becomes involved, it becomes very clear that despite Jeff's seemingly clean-cut image, he definitely fits the mold of a pedophile.  Little does anyone know that young Haley is not quite as vulnerable as first impressions indicate.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is a battle of minds and will-power, as Haley transforms into a scalpel-slinging psycho, while Jeff attempts at psychobabble only dig his hole deeper and deeper.  The emotional range each displays is mesmerizing.  Haley's actions grow more and more sadistic; at more than one point she admits to being insane.  Meanwhile, Jeff ping-pongs between bleak denial, hopeless sorrow, and fiery rage while under the tormenting teenager's control.<br /><br />Amidst exploitation, asphyxiation, and castration, Haley's glee dances on Jeff's growing despair, and the audience must attempt to weigh the merits of vigilante justice against its inevitable depravity.  Whereas Miike's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000640S9">Audition</a> treated it as an afterthought, the justification for Haley's actions is a common theme in the dialogue - but only a small part of the overall captivating script.  The suspenseful, mental sparring, where Jeff's witty pleading is consistently met with clever repartees from the erudite Haley, is something to behold.  The pacing, camera-work, and directing are minimal, accentuating the feeling of isolation, heightening the psychological maze slowly woven between the two characters - who are responsible for carrying 99% of the movie - and allowing for the exposure of countless emotional layers.<br /><br />This is the epitome if what psycho-thriller should be.  It's clearly the Americanized version - not nearly as much build-up, and quite a bit more "interaction" - of Audition, and aside from a questionable resolution (better choices are available for Jeff), it's highly recommended...on an empty stomach.</p></body></html>

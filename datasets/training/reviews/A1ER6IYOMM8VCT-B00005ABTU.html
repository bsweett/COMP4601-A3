<meta name="summary" content="GREAT CLASSIC HORROR MOVIE SPACEK IS PERFECT"></head><body><p>This is such a strange movie as you wouldn't know it was a horror film until very late in the movie. When it gets there it will scare the you know what out of you! Most have seen this film,but for those of you who haven't, I don't want to tell too much. Truly a classic and one of Kings stories get a grade A movie treatment. Spacek should get a lot of credit as it is her at the prom in a trance like state that takes this movie to another level, she is magnificent. The DVD has a great transfer with some excellent bonus features.</p></body></html>

Their chocolates were amazing.  Seemed like Wonka could invent candy other folks just dreamed of making---like ice cream that never melted even on the hottest day.  So amazing, in fact, that a good many of the employees performed industrial espionage.  Soon, Wonka's competitors were offering no-melt ice cream and gum that didn't lose its flavor.<br /><br />Willy could have no idea that at least one or two of his competitors could steal in no time flat.<br /><br />Sadly, Willy Wonka closed the door on the factory and let all his employees go.  No one's been in there since, but the choclate keeps pouring out.<br /><br />In an unprecedented move, Willy offers five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars.  The children who win these five tickets get to visit the chocolate factory for a day--and one will come away with an unheard of prize:  which Willy will not list!<br /><br />Charlie badly wants to win the prize, both for himself and his grandfather.  But, how does poor Charlie stand a chance if he only gets one bar of chocolate per year---on his birthday.<br /><br />Meanwhile, kids are finding the Golden Tickets.  First, there's a fat German kid who eats chocolate all the time.  Then, there's a spoilt British girl whose industrialist father buys her hundreds of thousands of chocolate bars just so she can get the one.  Then, a kid hacker from Colorado who pegs the system and knows just which bar to buy.  Finally, the world's champion gum chewer and her stage mom win.<br /><br />They're down to one.  Charlie finds a dollar in the snow and gets the last ticket.<br /><br />The next day is the tour of the chocolate factory.  Wonka, the five kids and their respective parents go on an amazing tour where they discover that a tiny race of people--the oompah loompahs--are who now work at the factory creating choclates.  Throughout the tour, each of the children is tested---til only one remains.<br /><br />The effects in this film are pretty amazing.  I will admit I wasn't certain Depp could pull the role off, but he did.  He's a somewhat more disociated Wonka than Gene Wilder, but still interesting.  Overall, a very enjoyable film and a sweet deal for both the young and the young at heart.</p></body></html>

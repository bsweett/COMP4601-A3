<meta name="summary" content="Five Stars For Spiderman!"></head><body><p>This is another smashing Spiderman movie.This movie has everything. The special effects are outstanding.Alfred Molina<br />plays the role of a scientist who becomes taken over by mechanical arms after a fusion experiment goes awry.He is turned into the evil villain Dr. Octopus who has four mechanical arms.<br />In the meantime Peter Parker is having mounting problems.Because<br />of his superhero career he is having trouble holding down a job. Aunt Mae is about to be evicted from his home.His heartthrob M.J.(played by Kirsten Dunst) is about to get married.Peter Parker<br />makes the decision to retire from crimefighting and just be normal.The retirement is short lived.Dr. Octopus calls Spiderman<br />out of retirement.You also have Harry Osborne still pursuing Spiderman.Osborne makes a deal with Dr. Octopus to capture Spiderman.The movie will hold your attention throughout.If you<br />don't see another movie this year see this one.I wish I could give it six stars.</p></body></html>

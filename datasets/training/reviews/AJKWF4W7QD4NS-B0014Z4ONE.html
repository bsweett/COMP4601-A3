Taking place between the 1930's and 40's, all three films feature professor and adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford in the role he was born to play; hard to believe Tom Selleck was originally considered for the role) on various death defying adventures all over the world.  The first film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, features Jones attempting to stop the Nazis from getting the Lost Ark of the Covenent.  This film is probably the most exciting of the three, with some cleverly imaginitive special effects and all around spookiness.  The second film, Indiana Jones & The Temple of Doom, is a prequel which finds Jones and two comrades (a young Asian boy and Kate Capshaw who is Mrs. Steven Spielberg) fighting against a cult who is enslaving Indian children.  This film wasn't too well received because of it's surprising violence, but it is my favorite of the trilogy and is loaded with suspense.  The third film, Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade, finds Jones trying to save his father (Sean Connery) from a Nazi regime who are hellbent on finding the Holy Grail.  This installment is the most comic like of the three, and Ford and Connery are great together.  This much hyped about DVD set is definitely worth owning, but the DVD extras are extremely lacking (then again, this is Paramount after all).  A fourth film is rumored to be in the works, but until that ever sees the light of day, you should definitely pick up this set.</p></body></html>

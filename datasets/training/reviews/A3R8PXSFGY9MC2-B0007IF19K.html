<meta name="summary" content="Ray"></head><body><p>Ray is a brilliant film looking at the life of Ray Charles. Jamie Foxx does an excellent job of portraying the man and you get a real feeling for the times he performed in and what shaped his music. You get to see what motivated Ray Charles and most aspects of his character, both good and bad. Of course the soundtrack is amazing. I found myself completely engrossed throughout and the direction style reminded me of Ali in places, which is no bad thing as that film is superb also! Overall a great film, which should both entertain and move. Well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

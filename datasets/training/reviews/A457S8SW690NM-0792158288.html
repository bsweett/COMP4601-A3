<meta name="summary" content="Some great adventure movies"></head><body><p>The Indiana Jones trilogy contains some of the best adventure movies ever made. They all have a distinct plot but they all revolve around a very neat adventure that blends in bursts of comedy. Harrison Ford is great as Indy and the adventures never cease to amaze. Like the Back to the Future Trilogy, these movies sre for adults and children. Everyone will love these classics. The first one is the classic one becuase it started the series and the second incorporates lots of lava and some "nasty food." Also, look at the name of the club in the opening scene of the temple of doom. It's called club Obi-Wan. Get it? The last Crusade has also some comic moments like when Hitler signs Indiana Jone's book. Sean Connery adds a lot to that one!<br /><br />So, these are great adventure movies with some great comedy and will leave your whole family exited to watch the next in the trilogy. An then you'll just have to rewatch the whole trilogy again!</p></body></html>

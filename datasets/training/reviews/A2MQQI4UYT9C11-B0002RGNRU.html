<meta name="summary" content="Love and Remembrance"></head><body><p>"Eternal Sunshine" was my favorite film of 2004, and one of my all-time favorites.  Given that Jim Carrey starred, that's quite a tribute to both him and the rest of the people (screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry in particular) involved with this delightful and imaginative project.  Both Carrey and co-star Kate Winslet play skillfully against type--he shy and introverted; she way off-beat.  Their trip through mind and memory takes awhile to get used to--like eyes adjusting to a darkened room, but it's full of wonderful surprises once you get used to the view.  Other treats include Elijah Wood (Frodo) role as junior memory erasure technician and Kirsten Dunst (Spiderman's girlfriend) quoting "Pope Alexander's" poem that gives the film its title.  My strongest recommendation--as long as you can handle a little (well a lot) of time shifting.</p></body></html>

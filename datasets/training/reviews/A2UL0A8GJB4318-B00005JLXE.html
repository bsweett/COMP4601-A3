<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Memorable...And Potent"></head><body><p>Every few months it seems, marvel is releasling a movie adaptation of one of its classic comicbooks.  This year, we have had (or will have) "X2," "The Hulk," and "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."  But buried beneath them, is "Daredeveil," a frenetic, eye-catching spectacle, but with enough heart and humor to help rise above it rumored shallowness.  Key to the movies' success is Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, who hits the right amount of brood and anger as "The Man with no Fear."  I would say that "Daredevil" reasserted my confidence in Affleck as a good actor.  <p>As a boy, Matt Murdock is blinded by a chemical waste accident, but his other senses functioned at superhuman levels, more than making up for his lack of sight.  As a man, he is a determined lawyer representing the downtrodden in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York.  At night, he wages a secret war against crime as Daredevil, a red-leather clad superhero.  His new enemy is the rumored Kingpin (an imposing Michael-Clark Duncan), one man who controls all the crime in New York.  At his disposal, Kingpin has a legion of criminals, most dangerous is the gleefully evil Bullseye (a delicious Colin Farrel) who can turn any object into a lethal projectile.  Caught up in the middle is Elecktra (a beautiful Jennifer Garner) who develops a relationship with Murdock and her doomed father (Erik Avari).<p>Even though "Daredevil" is a satisfying action movie, it does leave room for improvement for its inevitable sequels.  The characters could use a little more development, and the story could use a little tightening.  Also, was the play-fight between Murdock and Elecktra in the playground necessary?  I don't know.  To me, it seemed a little shallow as it balantly goes for eye-filling candy, instead of a little substance.  But other than that, "Daredevil" is a dark, lurid and satisfying action flick.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="loose account of a supposed true story but more of an urban legend"></head><body><p>Based on real events. That is what it says at the beginning. However, this movie is a very overblown and improbable version. This movie is sure to stir up an urban legend about the Australian Outback, and probably this movie means to do just that. Apparently something like 10,000 people go missing every year while in remote parts of the outback. This is sure to plant the seed in people's head that a serial killer or two lurk in the outback.<br />I've got to hand it to the makers, they pulled off an edge of your seat film. Even though it is pretty ordinary stuff. Travelers take a wrong turn in an isolated area and become prey to the local looney blokes.<br />here is more on the REAL STORY:<br /> 2 tourists travel down Stuart Highway in Wolfe Creek National Park, in the Northern Territory. A  bushman tries to assist them with car trouble and ends up trying to kill them, only to kill the male while the female escapes.<br />Sure to become an urban legend on that stretch of highway for sure.<br />Oh by the way, the film is really beautifully photographed in HIGH DEF.</p></body></html>

The added benefit was seeing it in the El Capitan in Hollywood.  With the organ grinding away as you enter, then, getting to see a pit crew in action and then some kids getting up on stage, wow, then the movie.<br /><br />The review of the movie tells a lot of the plot, but the sond "Finding Yourself" really reveals the story.  When I see this movie, I think of the genius behind it.  Some say that hope is lost in America, well, this movie is one of hope, one of coming of age, one of learning to consider where you are headed in life.<br /><br />What got me the most was the spontaneous applause at the end of the movie, the whole audience just suddenly errupted with applause, I have not experienced such a joyful reaction from an audience in a long time.  Not that it is a cartoon, it sends a message, one of friendship and one of turning your life around from selfishness to learning to be a friend.<br /><br />The message to me is that it may only take one person to turn around the lives of many.  The animation is just outstanding, the sound track, wow, what great songs.  I think this may be one of Pixar's greatest movies.<br /><br />"Find yourself" seeing cars.</p></body></html>

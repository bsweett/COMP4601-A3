Again,incredibly, I've talked to many who have never seen this film! Am I the only person who's noticed that Bogart and Rains are walking the wrong way in the final scene?  Or is this just a form of "poetic license" given to producers and directors? OBVIOUS MISTAKE IN ADVERTISEMENT-INGRID BERGMAN,NOT LAUREN BECALL SHOULD BE LISTED!</p></body></html>

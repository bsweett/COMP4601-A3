<meta name="summary" content="A beautiful, mysterious, pitch-perfect horror/fantasy flick."></head><body><p>The classic tale of Sleepy Hollow is brought blazingly alive in the competitive film year of 1999 and it has a lot to qualify for to be one of the year's best movies. Well, this movie has all these qualifications and more too! It is truly one of the modern greats and one of the year's best films. The film has awesome mystery, horror, comedy, romance and fantasy balled into a great and amazingly intelligent script by Andrew Kevin Walker. In fact, this is one of the most well written and clever horror films of all time. Some critics have dissed this movie's script but I really thought it was fabulous. To act out this wonderful script they cast Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, and they couldn't have made a better choice. Depp is in almost every scene, and he steals every one with his wit, great accent and great enthusiasm for the film. Christina Ricci is also very beautiful and mysterious, although a little out of her depth. I enjoyed Miranda Richardson's performance, and she has a surprising waiting in the end. The cinematography for the film is lush and stunning, the art and sets are fantastically Sleepy Hollow-ish, and the visuals are truly breathtaking. So much effort went into this film, and a lot of people brought the unforgettable story alive. But most of the credit must go to the visionary and endlessly plausible director Tim Burton, who, with his great ideas, vision, abilities and past credibility's, has the right stuff to make this movie the perfect horror-fantasy. This is one of the most memorable movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching, and one of the creepiest too. Sometimes I can still hear the headless horseman's stallion thundering along the forest, in search for heads to decapitate. I love this flick, and it kicks major butt, so if you're a Tim Burton fan, a person who enjoys the tale of Sleepy Hollow, a horror movie fan or just a movie fan in general, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed by this pitch-perfect masterpiece that is Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow!</p></body></html>

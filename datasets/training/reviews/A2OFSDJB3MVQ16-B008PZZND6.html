<meta name="summary" content="An over-rated film about gay love"></head><body><p>I had no qualms about viewing this highly praised movie since I've seen in the past such films as "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" (directed by the gay director, John Scheslinger) and a highly rated Movie for TV "That Certain Summer" with Hal Holbrook as a divorced "out of the closet" gay man dealing with his young son's discovery about why his parents divorced. These films were both excellent and I looked forward to seeing this film but I was disappointed. Despite excellent acting from Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams, the film left me cold.  I think one of the reasons was that the film focused a little too much on the two male characters and less on the women.  My question too was did Anne Hathaway's character know that her husband was gay--and what were the consequences that resulted in their marriage.  Maybe director Ang Lee's approach is a little too detached for this material and also the writing had too many questions unanswered for me to fully enjoy this film.  Sorry but "Crash" though not a perfect film really deserved the Best Picture Oscar.</p></body></html>

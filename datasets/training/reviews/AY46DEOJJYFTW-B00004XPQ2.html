<meta name="summary" content="David Lean masterpiece..."></head><body><p>David Lean directed this classic, masterpiece in 1957, right before he began work on Lawrence of Arabia. It is filled with<br />richness in theme, narrative, and characterization and supported by an incredible cast. This film describes the horrors of war and man's pyschological struggle to find meaning and survival amidst the horror.<br />Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) has been charged with building a vitally important railway bridge but his efforts are failing and only by soliciting help with a British prisoner, the charismatic Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), can he accomplish his task but this escalates into a duel of honor, Nicholson defying his captor's demands to win concessions for his troops. How the two officers reach a compromise, and Nicholson becomes obsessed with building that bridge, provides the story's thematic spine. Meanwhile an American escapee (William Holden) leads a commando raid to blow up the bridge. Alec Guinness won a much deserved Best Supporting Actor for his work. His realization at what he's sacrificed to keep his troops morale and survival is astonishing.</p></body></html>

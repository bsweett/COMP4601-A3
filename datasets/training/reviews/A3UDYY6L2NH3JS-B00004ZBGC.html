The apes turn military and war-minded because the gorillas take over and for them the only good human is a dead human. We already know that, well nearly that. From an ape general it is not surprising that he apes a certain colonel or is it general too? At least in the end he was a general, but then his horn was too little to be big enough for his appetite. As a matter of fact a second NASA rocket arrives with some more survivors looking for Taylor. But Taylor had literally disappear into thin air when trying to enter the forbidden zone. The newcomer, a certain Brent, recuperates the poor abandoned Nova who takes him back to the Ape city. And from there with a war on their hands they run into the forbidden zone to escape the gorillas. And they descend into the underground destroyed city of New York. There we are back, but with an enormous twist, to H.G. Wells, though the city of the apes is stratified in three classes that are three different species of apes. That sounds a little bit like a Brave New World. But the underground destroyed New York and its survivors have nothing to do with Terminator and the rebellion against the machines. They are pacifists who make their enemies kill each other in couples, and yet are not able to defend themselves since they have no weapon, or nearly no weapons. They have their God nevertheless and their God is a fully operational Doomsday Bomb. And that will be a big bang in the universe when it goes boom. Don't ask why and how all that found itself on a planet that is two thousand years away from the earth. Details, details, my dear Watson. And in the jungle you must presume, my dear Livingstone. And we presume. But a nuclear disaster on the earth brings humanity down, then apes take over and reverse the famous Darwinian evolution, and then war becomes inevitable and the human survivors of that cataclysm are pacifists who refuse to defend themselves except by calling for the help of their God, the nuclear auto de f&eacute; that destroyed them in the first place. No hope for these humans. 1970 was the year when all hell broke down, out and up in Vietnam and Cambodia and Indochina. There was no other alternative than a nuclear war for some and this film tries to reflect that mood, but certainly not to enlighten us with any hope. Die man die hard man that is your final and inescapable fate. I am still all shivering with the recollection of that 1970 year. Gosh it was bleak.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></body></html>

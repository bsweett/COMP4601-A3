<meta name="summary" content="Another great film from Alexander Payne from an equally winning book"></head><body><p>I'd read Kaui Hart Hemmings' excellent novel once I heard that it was Alexander Payne's newest project.  It seemed the perfect Payne vehicle: small enough to tell in whole without stripping out key parts (it's notable that Hart Hemmings' work started its life as a short story), featuring a flawed (though not deeply) protagonist at the heart of the story.  Piling this success on top of 'Election,' 'About Schmidt' and 'Sideways,' I can only say: this guy needs to work more.  I can't believe that he waited seven years after the brilliance of 'Sideways' to deliver another gem like 'The Descendants.'<br /><br />George Clooney has never been better than he is here as Matt King (though I thought his work in the title role as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014B8KSI">Michael Clayton</a> was superb).  He is (as widely quoted in the trailer) 'the backup parent.'  Now, with his family suddenly reeling from a tragic event, King is thrust to the forefront - primary caretaker of two daughters who grew up quickly under his nose - right at a critical professional juncture in which he needs to make a critical decision about his family's stake in large swathes of Hawaiian lands held under their trust and jurisdiction.  How King (and Clooney) handles those two rapidly evolving matters is the crux of the story.<br /><br />Whenever you read a book and then see the movie, you can't help but compare...<br /><br />What I liked...<br /><br />Shailene Woodley - She is stunningly good as older daughter Alexandra.  It's an awesome portrayal.  She's supposed to be model beautiful (check), a bit of a screw-up in her past (the movie gives a nod to that) and - to her father's surprise - a lot tougher and mature than he thought at event's outset.  In every scene with Clooney (and there are many of them), she's every bit his equal as a presence<br /><br />Hawaii - Hart Hemmings' is Hawaiian, so she doesn't spend a lot of time discussing what makes Hawaii Hawaiian.  Payne needs to do that for his wider audience.  He does so deftly - at the opening in King's voice over in which he tells you that living in Hawaii is not like living in paradise (they have their own concerns like everyone else), in a scene in which they go to look at their property "for one last time," in the houses and neighborhoods he shows (most modestly middle class).  This is the Hawaii of its residents, not its tourists.<br /><br />Other casting nuggets - Laird Hamilton as Troy (sounding reedy and borderline pathetic as you would expect someone in that situation)...brilliant choice; author Hart Hemmings tucked into a little Easter Egg as Matt's secretary...loved that; Matthew Lillard (Shaggy!) as Brian Speer...an unexpected choice, but pulled off very well indeed (his frozen face when confronted with King is perfect); Judy Greer as Julie Speer (was Payne casting due to the name rhyming?)...always a scene-stealer in supporting roles, she's great here again<br /><br />Pushing the the wife's story into the background - Here was the major script choice made by Payne: in the book, we come to know a lot more about Matt's wife (she's 'Joanie' in the book, 'Elizabeth' on screen).  We learn that she and Matt were vastly different.  The boating accident that put Joanie in the hospital is very representative of the way she lived her life: loud and and way up on the risk-o-meter.  One passage the stuck with me in the book.  A restauranteur tells him that he "liked when Joanie came because her presence encouraged everyone to drink more."  We learn about Joanie's personality in Matt's remembrances (the book is first-person from his perspective).  Payne could have done the same by going back in time and showing them together as a couple.  He chose not to do that.  I think the movie is better for it.  First, he's got two hours to tell a story that unfolded in print over almost 300 pages.  Second, the movie works better with Matt needing to go it alone...he can't be helped by his wife. Her near-lifeless presence brings that home.<br /><br />What I didn't like...<br /><br />Matt and Joanie/Elizabeth's relationship - They're depicted here as having been mutually unhappy (the words "ask you for a divorce" are mentioned at least three times).  In the book, it's more nuanced.  They were, right from the start, very different.  But Joanie "always came home with me."  It was a marriage of opposites that - despite what outsiders might have seen and felt - worked.  Or, rather, always had.  That's why the revelation about his wife and Speer stung so deeply.<br /><br />Sid - In the book, Alex's friend Sid is a steady stream of surprise to Matt.  He writes him off at the outset as shallow.  Turns out, he's anything but.  In movie, there's a hint of that.  In the book, it's better: it's Sid that calls Julie Speer to the hospital.  In the movie, Julie says she could "smell it on [Brian]" (after Matt and Alex's visit). In the book, she relates that "Sid told me.  He called the house yesterday."  Matt's response: "Sid," I say.  Well."  You can feel Matt's respect go up immensely with that one small scene.  I liked that Sid was instrumental in letting that key moment come to pass.<br /><br />All in all, those are small quibbles.  I heartily recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

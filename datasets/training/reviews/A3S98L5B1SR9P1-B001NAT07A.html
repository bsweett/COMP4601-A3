This movie started off right with it's brief tease of it's originality with scenes of "cat woman's" origin, but then got lost in the lack of thought in the story line thereafter. Making this movie very predictable and boring.  This movie depended on too many special effects and not enough realism to enjoy the characters. Even the romance scene was lacking the animal attraction and chemistry between the two characters, making their romance a very forgetable one.  Although, Ms.Berry is a very beautiful and attractive woman, this movie focused more on her sexual appeal in a cat suit instead of her ability to act. As she uses her whip and shows some skin to draw audiences, mainly of the male species, her true ability as an actress is over shadowed. Bottom-line: it was very disappointing to say the least.</p></body></html>

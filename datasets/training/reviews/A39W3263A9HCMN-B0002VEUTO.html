<meta name="summary" content="READ MY REVIEW. NONE OF THE OTHERS."></head><body><p>I'm sick of that 3.5 star rating. And I hate it when people give this movie a bad review. TCOR is NOT BAD! PUH-LEASE STOP GIVING IT A BAD REVIEW! In this companion to PITCH BLACK, an escaped convict finds him self in the battle for the human race.<br /><br />A lot of ppl think that this is one of those movies where some guy goes "Oh, I hate you! BAM BAM BAM!" and kills somebody. Well hello hello! None of that happens in this movie.<br /><br />I didn't like PITCH BLACK, but this movie makes up for it. With realistic s/fx, mind blowing backgrounds, you'll have one hell of a damn fun time!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />so far, 0 of 4 people found it helpful. Dammit, I wrote you an amusing review, so why can't you people find it as helpful as it REALLY is?</p></body></html>

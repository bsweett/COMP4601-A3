Fast forward to June '12, "wonder if on blu": astounded that no release yet offered for this classic. Did some research, then ordered Superbit dvd <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AGQ6Z">Lawrence of Arabia (Superbit Collection)</a>, for picture quality, and 2 disc set <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXB2">Lawrence of Arabia</a>, for myriad of extra features. Each of these latter purchases were $6.00 (flawless used condition), and you can NOW get the 2 disc (non-SB) NEW for $6.00 (list $40) from Amazon!! Both of these releases are terrific in presentation AND packaging (2 disc has elegant cloth cover even!). Am just now seeing that blu WILL be released -in this country- in November, coincidentally just in time for black friday (having been earlier released in Sept '12 for Eng,Swe,Den)! AND, for now, if you "need" the blu, big bucks will be needed to procure this massive box set, with its oh-so-unappealing cover art (imho). HIGHLY recommend that if you can be content with a measly dvd, or want to purchase for a film fan -not caught up in need for "latest/greatest"- than the 2 disc cloth cover set -six bucks!- would be the ticket. (I note that many folk insist upon "only way to view proper is on big screen". My big screen is 50", so am content with these fairly recent dvd releases.) The Superbit version did get highest marks for video quality, and included DTS audio, when released in '03. ...but enough of rant, let's enjoy the film already (or can't we, "unless . . .?")<br />7/28/12 UPDATE: while watching "making of", discovered that new "unappealing cover art" is actually from original promotional campaign; had just never seen it before, so stand corrected on it's blu inclusion. After watching Superbit version this date, decided that I will eventually get blu, when single comes out. Sweeping, panoramic sequences -though very nice on BOTH older versions just bought- can only be fantasied about in pending hi-def format!<br />**9/6/12 final update! 2 disc blu now avail. for pre-order, $18.99. Life so good!**</p></body></html>

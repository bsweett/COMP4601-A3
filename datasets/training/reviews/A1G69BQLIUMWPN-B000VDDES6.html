<meta name="summary" content="This movie has no "Anchor""></head><body><p>I was disappointed in this movie.  Ron Burgundy gets so tiring after like the first 20 minutes that it is hard to even watch this movie all the way through.  I thought Christina Applegate's character was funny and the guy who was slow was funny in the part where he was yelling just becaue everyone else was yelling.  But the rest of the movie  was a bore.  I just couldn't believe such great actors would stoop so low to do this movie.  Not something I would own or even put myself through watching again.</p></body></html>

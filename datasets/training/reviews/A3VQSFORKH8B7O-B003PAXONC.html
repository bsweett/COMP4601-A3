<meta name="summary" content="GREAT THRILLS, FINE STORYTELLING WITH FASCINATING END."></head><body><p>The third adaptation of Richard Matheson's apocalyptic novel (behind <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WC3A0I">The Last Man on Earth</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0BU">The Omega Man</a>), "I Am Legend" is a a fine film that features great chills, thrilling action sequences, and fine-but-uneven storytelling. Will Smith gives a terrific performance as Robert Neville, and does a good job of carrying this movie on his own for more than half its length. While the end might seem disjointed from the rest of the film, it is still very fascinating, leaving one to ponder the possibilities.<br />The DVD comes with terrific picture and sound, and some good extras. The alternate theatrical cut of the film is basically the same except for the ending, which is weaker than the other one. Overall, this is a fine film that fans of action/horror films will enjoy.<br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+</p></body></html>

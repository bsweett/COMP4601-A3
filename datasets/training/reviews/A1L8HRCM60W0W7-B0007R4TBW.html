<meta name="summary" content="GREAT SERIOCOMIC BITS, BUT NOT QUITE THE EDEN CRITICS HAILED"></head><body><p>In a nutshell, this is a very worthy rental even if it doesn't quite live up to the odes hailed by critics. In fact the general tempo of Garden State is reminiscent of a recent film with similar idiosynchratic tones, The Station Agent.<br /><br />But director/writer/actor Braff's ability to underplay his befuddled stance in the midst of wacky comedy without appearing silly himself, is quite impressive. His sublime sensibility permeates the entire film as our protagonist visits his mother's house after a patch of nine years to attend her funeral, in the process reuniting with his old high school buddies as well as his family.<br /><br />The characters are interestingly quirky, some less hokey than others, but I couldn't help leaving with an intense personal disdain for Natalie Portman and her incredulous antics.<br /><br />The humour is endearing and generally clever, plus we get a certain "detour" that turns out to be thematically quite relevant. Much of the film's fizz wears out by the tail end though.<br /><br />A word for the soundtrack: it is stellar, throwing into the fray some cool chill-out inputs from Zero 7 and Coldplay. I recommend it more than the film itself, get a copy if you like your music relaxed and downtempo.<br /><br />Overall, Garden State is a likeable little charmer with incidental pleasures, but it's not quite the cinematic Eden that critics promised. Recommended rental.</p></body></html>

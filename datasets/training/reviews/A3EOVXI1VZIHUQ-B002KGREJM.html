<meta name="summary" content="Forest Whitaker earns his Oscar nomination in every scene"></head><body><p>Last King of Scotland is a strange movie. A movie that without Forest Whitaker's performance really would have fallen by the wayside in the theatres this year. Luckily for everyone involved with the film, and for audiences everywhere, it does contain Whitaker's intense portrayal.<br /><br />The story doesn't actually center on Whitaker's Idi Amin, however; it centers around James McAvoy's fictional Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan: a spoiled young man who feels unappreciated by his father and so chooses to spin a globe and head to the first country he lands on. This ends up sending him to Uganda.<br /><br />The sheltered, naive way that Garrigan looks at the world ends up costing him when he is enlisted to be the personal physician of President Idi Amin after a chance encounter. This film could be seen as a psychological thriller where "nothing is as it seems". It's simply set on a grander scale where you have an infamous dictator as the deceiving friend.<br /><br />The film itself gets a little slow at times, and it's difficult not to be annoyed with some of the poor decisions that McAvoy's character makes, but the acting pulls this slightly above average script into something audiences can really enjoy, although most audience members will find themselves watching passively, anxiously awaiting Whitaker's next appearance on screen, as he really carries the picture.</p></body></html>

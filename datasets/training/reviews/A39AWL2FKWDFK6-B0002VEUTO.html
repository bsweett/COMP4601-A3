<meta name="summary" content="Disjointed Diesel drama"></head><body><p>Vin Diesel, playing futuristic fugitive Riddick, grunts and growls his way through "The Chronicles of Riddick" in a manner reminiscent of Schwarzenegger in The Terminator.  Don't get your hopes up, "Riddick" lacks the impact of seminal cultish Arnie flick.<p>While method acting isn't Diesel's forte, his beefcaked psychique provides a worthy macho image for this role.  The plot which was poorly developed doesn't really define the flick as it is more a vehicle for computer generated special effects.  Some action sequences move so fast as to appear blurry which didn't enhance my viewing pleasure.<p>It seems that Riddick is a survivor of a thought to be exterminated race called the Furians.  The supreme power in the universe is a sect called the Necromongers.  Their mission seems to be the conquest of all civilizations in order to seek their nirvana called Underverse(?).  The powerful Lord Marshal leader of the Necros played by Colm Feore has been foretold that he will be destroyed by a Furian.  His mission becomes clear.......... destroy Riddick.<p>This movie was essentially nothing more than violent eye candy.  The accomplished Dame Judi Dench was a strange sight to see among the cast in a film of this type.  "Riddick" fails to live up to the mail biting drama established so wonderfully in the prequel "Pitch Black".</p></body></html>

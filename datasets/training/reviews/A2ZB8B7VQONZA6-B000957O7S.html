<meta name="summary" content="KEVIN JAMES & WILL SMITH MAKE THE PERFECT ON SCREEN TEAM."></head><body><p>First off I have to admit that the big reason I went to see this film was because Of "KING OF QUEENS" Kevin James, but it also helped that the very talented Will Smith is in this to. Director Andy Tennant did an excellent job with this film. Various types of humor are incorperated into the film as well as the romantic factor for all you date movie people. This would best be described as a Comedy with romantic elements, not a romantic comedy.<br /><br />We will start with the star Will Smith, I for one think it is great to see him in something else other then a big budget sci-fi flick again. And he did a excellent job in his first role in this type of film, his preformance is amazing. His charisma and screen precence make his character very belivable. Of course that changes after meeting his love, and he becomes a clumsy idiot, and he plays it greatly.<br /><br />That brings some one that was miscast, EVA MENDAS. I like her, infact I love her but she just didn't work in this role. She gave what she could, but the preformance wasn't belivable. That's all I can say about that, nothing more nothing less.<br /><br />Now comes the highlight of the film, the one and only KEVIN JAMES. What can one say about this brilliant preformance. Why dosn't this man make some more movies in his off time from his excellent show "KING OF QUEENS". Kevin's preformance is so good, so brilliant, so belivable it is nothing short of a classic preformance. His nice guy shy role fits him perfectlly, so much so that when he isn't on screen you are left waiting and wanting more of Mr James. Most of the films best moments happen because of him, the ending is a perfect example, or his early dance scene with Will.<br /><br />Which brings me to the on screen chemestry of these two brilliant preformers. When both are on screen you will laugh with out a doubt. After the film is over you might be left wanting to see more of them together again on the big screen. The chemestry between the two is amazing, no team I can remember has done so well together since Samual & John on "PULP FICTION". I'am sure there have been other great teams like Farley & spade in "TOMMEY BOY", but none have done so in the recent onslaught of terrible movies to come out lately.<br /><br />Thankfully this film is a gem in the film industry, and I can't wait to own it on dvd when it is released.</p></body></html>

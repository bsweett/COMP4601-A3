<meta name="summary" content="Yet More Hate for the Corps."></head><body><p>Here, in Jarhead, director Sam Mendes has a chance to build on some of the hate and distrust for the Marine Corps which he constructed previously in his overrated blockbuster American Beauty. It's not a pretty sight, and one would think, based on the psychological instability prevalent within Swoff's platoon, that these soldiers had spent four years fighting on the Eastern front instead of four days in the Middle East during Desert Storm. That these fellows underwent the type of ungluing they did, based on such a short period in action, is incredibly unlikely, and, to do so in such a uniform fashion, defies belief. When contemplating the madness of these characters, the fact that they all graduated from high school, let alone avoided placement in a special education program for the emotionally disturbed, is astonishing. Overall, I completely doubted the veracity of this story.<br /><br />The attempt to portray the entire company as a group of blood-thirsty zealots, who whoop and holler as a village gets destroyed in Apocalypse Now, was actually quite offensive. I really think that these negative stereotypes are put forth as a means to defile the USMC, who stand guard over our safety regardless of the way in which Hollywood demeans them. A good bit of propaganda is also included in the allusion to the fact that everything done in Iraq was due to our lust for oil. This is patently ridiculous. Our government is the richest entity on this earth and they're not concerned about how much their citizens pay for gasoline. They could care less, yet this was just another way to delegitimize the presence of the Marines on the peninsula which was probably the purpose for making the movie in the first place.</p></body></html>

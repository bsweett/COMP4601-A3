Unforgiven does feature plenty of action, but the movie is driven more by the characters rather than the action. The characters are all mostly well written for, but some aren't as interesting as others. None of the characters are boring or anything, but some work better than others. The script is well thought out and works on pretty much every level<br /><br />Clint Eastwood won his first Oscar for Unforgiven and he delivers a very well made movie. As I stated even with the action, Unforgiven is much more driven by the characters and Eastwood does a great job at brining the script to life. His scenes are generally well paced and he delivers some great action, suspense and real life human emotions. The only problem I really had was the running time. I personally felt the 134-minute running time was a little overly long. While none of the scenes are filler scenes and they all add to the plot and to the characters I did feel a few minutes here and there could have been edited out and it wouldn't hurt the movie at all.<br /><br />But regardless Eastwood delivers an excellent movie and the final act was nothing short of brilliant. The suspense level is excellent and while the shoot outs don't drag out, but they aren't too brief either and while the whole movie was well done I think the final act is where Eastwood really shines as director.<br /><br />Besides directing and producing Clint Eastwood stars as William Munny and this might be the best character Eastwood has ever played or at least the most complex. The thing about Eastwood is he is a great actor in the sense that he's best known for that tough guy role and even in his lighter movies he still has that tough guy persona and you'll be hard pressed to find someone better at that role than Eastwood, but he doesn't have a lot of range as an actor. That isn't a knock against him since he's great at what he does, but in Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood shows more range than anything before or after this movie.<br /><br />William Munny was a cold blooded killer who once married changed his ways and is seeking a sort of redemption. He knows what he's done in the past and he knows it was wrong, but what's done is done and in many ways William Munny is a broken man since the death of his wife. William Munny may not be as cool and entertaining as say Dirty Harry, but like I said he is the most complex of all Eastwood's characters. There was a lot of depth to William Munny and Eastwood really delivers a performance of a lifetime. We've seen characters like this before, but Eastwood as director and actor manages to make it seem fresh and different. Clint was nominated for best actor, but lost out to Al Pacino for Scent of a Woman, but I personally feel of all the nominated actors that year Eastwood was by far the best with a very complex character.<br /><br />The supporting cast is excellent with Morgan Freeman as Ned Logan, who like Munny has done bad things in the past and is trying to put it behind him. Gene Hackman like always is great and was very deserving of his Oscar win, but I don't understand how Freeman wasn't nominated. Jaimz Woolvett as The Schofield Kid nearly steals the show as a wannabe gunslinger.<br /><br />Like I said Unforgiven is a great picture and it's one of those movies as I think back to I like it even more, but still wouldn't place it in my top 5 Eastwood flicks. Unforgiven though is a really complex movie with excellent characters and like I said Eastwood is great at what he does, but doesn't have a lot of range, but here he shows all that range and more. William Munny is truly a great character and despite any problems I had with Unforgiven it comes highly recommended to Eastwood and Western fans.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has excellent quality and makes the movie look like it was done recently and not in 1992. The extra features are great with some good behind the scenes, plus the documentary Eastwood on Eastwood, which is a must see for fans of the Iconic actor.</p></body></html>

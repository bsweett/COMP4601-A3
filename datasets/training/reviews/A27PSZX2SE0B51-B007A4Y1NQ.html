<meta name="summary" content="The crueler the better"></head><body><p>I remember first hearing about "Being John Malkovich" more than a year before it was released to theatres.  At that time it was just a title, a concept, and a guarantee that Malk (and Cusack) would be involved.  Stunned at the bravado and imagination, I couldn't wait to buy tickets.  Sadly, sometimes anticipation ruins the result, and I left the theatre disappointed, if not a little bored.<p>Having recently seen the movie again, I found myself enjoying it immensely, buying in to its eclectic concept and execution wholeheartedly, while holding a silly smile on my face the whole time.  This second experience leads me to a conclusion that dovetails nicely with one of the film's major themes: I'm not the same person now as I was then.<p>Director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman realize their vision with exuberance and melancholy, which, although paradoxical emotions, make an easy fit together.  Kaufman's script cares not for the rules of the physical world or sane human behaviour.  This apathy allows him to go down roads other screenwriter's have not the talent or the courage to travel.  Jonze, he who cut his teeth on Beastie Boy, Weezer, and Fatboy Slim videos and who's iconoclastic vision reminds one favourably of his musical namesake, achieves Kaufman's vision so sublimely you'd think the two men sprung from the same artistically fertile womb.  They could have made a perfectly banal movie, and only included the marionette sequences, and it still would have been fascinating.  Throw in the 7 1/2-floor orientation video, Dr. Lester and his deaf receptionist, the ingenious celebrity cameos, and the 'Dance of Despair and Disillusionment', and you've got yourself a unique and fascinating vision.  Top it all off with the stunning "What happens when a man goes through his own portal" scene (where the word 'Malkovich' loses all meaning), and I can't think of a way they could have improved this movie.<p>(Re-reading the above paragraph, it's amazing to think that not two hours ago I would have called anyone who'd written such rubbish a frantic imbecile; ah, how quickly the tune can change when the orchestra is given time to practice&#8230;)<p>John Cusack is miles away from Lloyd Dobler country, and yet he still manages to hit the role on the sweet spot.  His Craig is an open wound, festering from lack of love and attention.  Cusack makes him uncomfortable to watch, which is a neat trick because Johnny boy's roles usually go down smoothly.  Like the rest of the actors here, he subverts his own persona (and others'; he's a puppeteer, natch), in a movie about subverting personae.<p>Others themes to watch for (and this is by no means an exhaustive list), include the meaning of the individual and the self, loneliness, obsession, genius, unrequited love, existentialism, capitalism, ethics, morality, celebrity, theology, immortality, passion, art, the tortured artist, vanity, inspiration, and of course, fractional numbers.  It tackles all the big themes, and it tackles them hard.<p>Why is Cameron Diaz in this movie? I asked myself upon first viewing.  Why bring her aboard, and then waste the one reason why you would cast Cameron Diaz, i.e., because she looks like Cameron Diaz!  Putting her in a fright wig, and never letting her near the shower just seemed counterproductive.  Well, on further review, she actually does a fine job in both creating her character and subverting her glamorous Cameron Diaz persona.  She shows longing and frustration, and then ecstasy with ease, and is able to pull off some of the deadpan absurdity that Lotte's dialogue requires.<p>Catherine Keener proves that if you need someone to play a sexy ice queen, then she's your girl.  Ratcheting up a notch her work as a similar character in "Your Friends and Neighbors", Keener is a vital life force, giving energy and vitality to a film peopled with losers and freaks (that's the film's message, not just my opinion).  Whenever she's onscreen, you fear for your life in the audience, for she just might lash out through the screen and slap you where you sit without blinking an eye.  But, she's also able to sincerely play the more emotional moments, without believability and vulnerability.  I love watching this classy lady on film.  More Keener please!<p>Malkovich himself pulls off the film's best acting, especially when he has to portray what happens while Craig is inside his skull.  It's a trick that Cage/Travolta tried to pull off, without success, in "Face/Off".  Here, Malk and Cusack form a superior tandem (having worked together previously in "Con Air"; that's not the jewel thief movie everyone is talking about, is it?).  Malk details Cusack's mannerisms with spot-on accuracy.  But there are other moments where Malk mocks himself, his celebrity, and his supposed lifestyle.  Scenes showing him earnestly rehearsing "The Cherry Orchard" and "Richard III", greeting obtuse fans who praise him for his sensitivity in playing "retards", or passionately ordering bathroom towels from a mail order catalog not only subvert his persona, but deconstruct it, and then deconstruct it again.  This movie wouldn't have worked if Malkovich had no sense of humour about himself (His advice to Spike Jonze upon taking the role: 'The crueler the better'; "Being Tom Cruise", while probably a bigger ticket, wouldn't have packed the same punch).  Kudos to him for getting, and running with, the joke.<p>[The DVD is loaded with quirky video pieces, such as the entire orientation video and Malkovich-as-puppeteer documentary, both featured in the movie; plus, it has an odd behind the scenes look at one of the extras driving along the Jersey Turnpike, and a mock interview with Spike Jonze that's a dirty gag in more ways than one]</p></body></html>

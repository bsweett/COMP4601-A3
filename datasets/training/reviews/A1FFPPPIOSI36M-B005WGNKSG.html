<meta name="summary" content="A truly suspenseful and original movie"></head><body><p>There are umpteen reviews of this movie so I won't further discuss  the plot in detail.<br /><br />This is a magnificent, richly detailed and emotionally moving film that offers a tremendous reward for those who stick with it and experience the climax. It's many related stories woven into one. This is not a movie to watch a bit at a time but rather, if you want to enjoy the emotion of the story,  you must be involved throughout the duration of the flick<br /><br />There's a lot going on here. You have the woes of the title character, Lisbeth who is an abused ward of the State.You have an investigative trail pursued by a publicly defamed journalist, Michael. You have the reputation and exploits of Michael's small, investigative newspaper. You have debilitating secrets exposed of an aristocratic family and you have a fantastic disappearance mystery.<br /><br />The story is told in a slow moving yet highly absorbing manner. As the plot furthers, the mystery and eerie atmosphere steadily develops. The director does a very effective job by creating suspense through the prolonged use of old black and white photographs. During multiple times, there is simply the closeup of 40 year old portrait of the subject of the disappearance which is utilized in an effectively, spooky manner.<br /><br />This is a Swedish film with subtitles. The subtitles actually enhance the mysterious effect of the movie. It makes the viewer pay close attention to the dialog and excises any unwanted, unnecesary chatter. Part of the haunting charm of the movie involves the old world, European aura of many of the characters so the lack of English fosters this aspect perfectly (I cannot imagine this film being remade, which it is, by Hollywood, since I feel that taking away this "European" aura will take away what makes the film so interesting).<br /><br />Although there is action in the film, that is not what makes the film so good. The quality in the movie is not so much in the visual but rather in the quality of the story, the character development, and how it all resolves itself.<br /><br />This film gets better with repeated viewing since there is a lot to absorb. This is a fresh alternative to the mainstream.<br /><br />P.S. The other 2 films "The Girl who played with Fire" and "The Girl who kicked the Hornets Nest" are not merely sequels, they pick up EXACTLY where the preceding films end... although the three films are quite different from each other. To see one of the films before the other would be a mistake since each is predicated upon the earlier one. This film is a mystery, "Fire" acts as a "James Bond" like, spy piece and "Hornets Nest" is a courtroom drama. Each film is good but this first one is by far the best since it is quite an effective mystery.</p></body></html>

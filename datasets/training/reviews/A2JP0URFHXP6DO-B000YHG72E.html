<meta name="summary" content="FUN CHRISTMAS FILM!"></head><body><p>Will Ferrell, one of the funnier of the recent Saturday Night Live cast members, stars as Buddy the Elf.  As a baby living in an orphanage, the baby buddy manages to crawl out of his crib and into Santa's bag of toys.  When Santa (Ed Asner) returns to the North Pole, the baby is found and they decide to raise him as an elf.  This north pole is straight out of a Rankin-Bass Animation with stop-motion snowmen and woodland creatures.<br /><br />Buddy is adopted by Papa Elf, played in his best deadpan style by Bob Newhart.  But all is not well, Buddy is twice the size of all the other elves and just doesn't excel at toy making.  He's finally told that he's human...he was put up for adoption and his father WAlter(james Caan) never knew he had a son.<br /><br />Walter is now a publishing Exec in NY and what's more..he's on the naughty list.  Buddy sets out...walking...all the way from the North Pole to NY to meet his dad.  Along the way he encounters a few adventures like getting a job as a Gimbels department store Elf, and getting into a fight with the fake Santa, and meeting a beautiful, but lonely girl, Jovie.<br /><br />Of course Walter at first thinks Buddy's nuts...but a blood test proves Buddy is his son and takes him home to his wife (Mary Steenburgen) and son Michael.<br /><br />As you would expect, Buddy eventually wins over his gruff father and imbues everyone around him with the true spirit of Christmas.<br /><br />The movie is very predictable but what Christmas movie isn't.  Ferrell is just so damn funny with his child-like portrayal of buddy, winning over everyone he meets...even the clerks in the mail room.  Ferrell really has great timing.<br /><br />All the roles are pretty standard, especially steenburgens who always seems to play the nice, sweet mother figure.  There are also some nice bit parts from Andy Richter and Artie Lange as the aforementioned fake Santa who gets into a fight with Buddy.<br /><br />The two disk DVD is loaded with a lot of extras including several cute little games you can play with your dvd remote.<br /><br />I enjoyed it a lot!</p></body></html>

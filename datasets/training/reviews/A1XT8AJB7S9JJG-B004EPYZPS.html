<meta name="summary" content="A very good sci/fi thriller that fans of Cloverfield will love. Could have been a little shorter and been better though. I say B"></head><body><p>"Do not speak of this or else you and your parents will die." When a group of kids set out to film a scene for a movie they want to submit to a contest they witness a train crash. When the man that caused it gives them a warning and people start disappearing they begin to investigate further. This is a difficult movie to review. Much like "Cloverfield" the preview gives nothing away, and I don't want to ruin anything or give too much away. I will say though that you can really tell that this is a JJ Abrams movie, and Spielberg's ideas are all over this as well. I would have to say that this is a pretty good mix of "Cloverfield" and "Stand By Me" with a steadier camera and more tense. The biggest problem with this movie to me is that it was too slow in some parts. Trying to put too much in the movie it takes a lot of repetition and long drawn out exposition scenes which hurt the flow of the movie to me. If they simplified it just a little or had more faith in the viewer it would have been much better then it was. On the other hand this was much much better then I was expecting. Overall, a tense and entertaining thriller that is definitely worth a watch. It was just a few tweaks from being a classic. I give it a B+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.<br /><br />*Also try - Cloverfield & Skyline</p></body></html>

I didn't find it impressive that some teenage con-artist was frauding corporate America, which inevitably the tax payers have to front the bill for.  I didn't find his character likable, charming or intelligent, which "Catch Me If You Can" tried to convey to it's audience.  I also believe that this film totally exaggerated what really happened.  I find it hard to believe he did half the stuff he did in the movie.  The acting was overdone and horrible for lack of a better word.  It seemed like everyone in this movie was just soaking up the limelight and loving every minute of it.  Less is more, ever hear of that cliche?  I was hoping Leonardo's character was going to get caught sooner. This would have made the film shorter, considering the 2 1/2 hours it lasted....what's up with that by the way?!?  I would have enjoyed more footage of him locked up in prison, paying for what he did.  And to add insult to injury, this film made sure to inform us that this guy now works for the FBI and makes millions of dollars!!!  Woohoo,who cares, next.....</p></body></html>

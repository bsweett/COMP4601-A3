<meta name="summary" content="The Doctor is in....."></head><body><p>When Hannibal was eating his way through theaters earlier this year, I thought to myself &quot;I can't wait for the DVD!!!&quot; I live for the behind-the-scenes stuff, so I was dying to find out how the filmmakers accomplished the effects...Gary Oldman's Verger makeup, the pigs, the climactic buffet scene....so did the DVD deliver? Pretty much. The deleted scenes were very good, and I was especially pleased to see a VERY long sequence concerning Inspector Pazzi's hunt for the infamous &quot;Il Mostre&quot;. These scenes really fleshed out the characters. The 5 behind the scenes featurettes are informative, even if there is virtually NOTHING about the Verger makeup. I really enjoyed the the poster gallery, as well. The film itself looks great, and the commentary by Director Ridley Scott is a keeper. I especially liked his overview of the 3rd ending they were considering. Couldn't they have filmed the Book's ending though?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="You know what they call a cheesy review in Paris?  A review with Cheese"></head><body><p>This film is all about dialogue, I know what your saying, Check out the big brain on Mike, I'm a smart mother father.  This movie had me wanting to walk the earth, you know, walk the earth, meet people... get into adventures. Like Caine from "Kung Fu", just so i could get into conversations and practice dialogue such as this.<br />Of course, not all conversations are gonna go smoothly like in Pulp Fiction  and there are going to be ignorant people who get angry and are ready to blow, to them i say.  "Oh! Oh! You ready to blow?"  Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherflower, motherflower! , I'm Superfly T.N.T., I'm the Guns of the Navarone!<br />You probably came into this review thinking here comes another plot synopsis, usually, most readers would be happy with some freeze-dried reviewers choice, but Mike springs this serious GOURMET shiznit on us!<br />A lot of movies try to be clever but aren't in the same ballpark as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same F'in sport.<br />So finally in closing I'd like to exuberantly add, mmmmmm this is a tasty movie, if it's ever on television check it out sometime.  Actually if you haven't seen it yet, I don't wanna hear about no mf ing ifs. All I wanna hear from your anus is, You ain't got no problems, Mike. I'm on the mother-father. Go back online, order Pulp Fiction, and wait for the dvd, which should be coming directly.</p></body></html>

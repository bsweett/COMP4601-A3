<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating!"></head><body><p>I never thought a movie/documentary about animals would make me feel this way, but the French-made "March of the Penguins" truly makes you feel a great degree of respect (for lack of a better term) for what these funny little birds go through in order to reproduce. The fascinating insights into their lives, along with the impact we as humans inflict on their habitat are perfectly framed by Morgan Freeman's narration laid on top of a fascinating score (one of 2005's best). The result is one of those movies you can watch over and over again and it doesn't get old (even more so, if you have children at home). Without a doubt one of the best in 2005, and one of the best documentaries ever.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is a movie worth standing up for!"></head><body><p>After the beginning of the sage of "X-Men" beginning with the 2000 original and going all the way up to a much grander scale with "X-Men United", the third in what is sometimes referred to as the trilogy of X-Men films entitled "The Last Stand" brings the epic saga to a glorious close. I am very much clueless as to why this movie seems to be getting far more negative reviews than it's predecessors. While far from perfect, "The Last Stand" is true to it's title: It is a grand finale to the current X-Men movie saga. Yet I just can't imagine how they can make a fourth one after the events that take place here unless they are doing Wolverine or Magneto spin-off movies.<br /><br /> Some time after Charles Xavier's X-Men and his archenemy Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants united against a common foe hell-bent on wiping out the mutant race, the two camps are suddenly torn apart in an acrimonious division between the mutant race as non-mutant or `normal' humans devise a medical substance that works as a `cure' for mutant powers and suppresses the genes that cause the mutant powers to manifest. The so-called cure divides the mutant community into several camps but the prominent ones are the X-Men lead by Charles Xavier who work to bridge the divide between mutants and non-mutants, the second is of the scientists devising the `cure', and the third and most vicious is Magneto's camp who views the `cure' as a tactic to commit genocide against the mutant community and he and his army aim to destroy this cure and will destroy anyone who stands in his way, even if it's a mutant. So the battle begins and the battle lines are now drawn. Xavier, The X-Men and their allies believe in tolerance and bridging the divide between the mutants and human beings but Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants believes that mutants are the superior race on earth and aims to establish mutant control over non-mutants.<br /><br /> The so-called cure devised on a research facility on Alcatraz Island was made in reaction to the news of an enormously powerful mutant with the ability to wipe out entire cities with one fell swoop. Jean Grey, who was thought to have actually died after sacrificing herself to save the others from a large flood, mysteriously returns to life but with a far greater power that manifest in the subconscious parts of her mind. This power sees Grey revived as the Phoenix. Yet these enormous news powers that have manifested in her, have made her a monstrously powerful mutant whose powers endanger everyone around her, both ally and enemy alike, mutant and non-mutant alike, as well as the entire planet.<br /><br /> So the battle lines are drawn and the war begins between the three camps, the non-mutants protecting this `cure', the X-Men aiming to end the enmity between the races, and Magneto's Brotherhood organization's goals of mutant superiority. It is indeed the war to end all wars as so it is said. Who will turn out victorious when it is over?<br /><br /> I am absolutely proud to have seen this movie. A major reason for this is that the whole idea of a `cure' for mutants reminds me of the bigoted beliefs in `curing' homosexual and bisexuality in human beings and the horrific consequences of these bigoted beliefs. While too complex to jam into this review, watching "The Last Stand" really reminded me vividly of the gay rights movement occurring across the United States with one camp being those who've made their inner peace with their orientation and the other being the camp that views homosexuality as a `disease' which is completely and totally absurd. Such behavior is documented in almost every species of animals including dogs, cats, as well as our closest relatives, the chimpanzees. Though there's much more about this that cannot be squashed into this review, "The Last Stand" story plot I felt has a lot of parallels to the battle against homophobia and intolerance against not just gays, lesbians and bisexuals, but also others because of their differences. There is no need for a `cure' for this orientation.<br /><br /> The movies problems though are similar to it's predecessors. Rogue is just another false-angst-ridden teen who's reduced from a dynamite comic character to just a wooden stock character who has almost no role in the events. In fact, Rogue felt more like an cameo extra rather than a main character. I really like this character and the complex background but after seeing some improvement in "X2" over its 2000 predecessor, I was disappointed. I think they should do a Rogue spin-off movie to make up for this. My biggest disappointment was the small role of Mystique after her front-row seat in the last movie. After being a major staple in the last two, Mystique is almost completely absent after about 20 minutes into the movie.<br /><br />Storm though is an improvement and has far better roles in this than before. The movie also somewhat tones down some of the emotional weight in favor of tons of action and a dazzling array of special effect. The emotional part is definitely there throughout but in many areas, it gets lost amidst the heavy amounts of action battle sequences and special effects in many parts of the movie. Who knows what may come next but after seeing this, I don't see how they could make another one without the characters who were so much a staple throughout this saga unless it's a total reboot of the film series similar to how "Batman Begins" rebooted the Batman movie franchise after the disaster of "Batman and Robin" a decade ago.</p></body></html>

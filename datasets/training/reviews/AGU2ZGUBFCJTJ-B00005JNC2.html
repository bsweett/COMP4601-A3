<meta name="summary" content="The Moose Hole - Art Imitates Life in the 'Garden State'"></head><body><p>Progressing from the rather limited realm of television productions to the far more expansive universe of major motion pictures can be quite an overwhelming experience for any aspiring young performer, as some have found out the hard way. The cast members of Friends, for example, with the exception of Miss Jennifer Aniston of course, have had little in the way of success making the transition - David Schwimmer has had no box office hits, Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow have each at least one cult classic (in spite of both being ruined by their unnecessary sequels - when will Hollywood learn), Matt LeBlanc had the Charlie's Angels franchise (though he was never featured prominently), and Courtney Cox made the best with both the Scream franchise and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (all of this in spite of the fact that she is married to David Arquette). Is it so much a mystery now as to why they demanded so much money per episode in the final season? They knew they would not be finding much in the way of work after the show ended. Sure there are success stories, but those who take make the leap gamble their future career opportunities in Hollywood.<br /><br />The story follows a man coming to grips with who he is and where his life is going following the death of his mother. Andrew Largeman did not live a carefree childhood back in his home state of New Jersey. Following an incident when he was young where he pushed his mother, causing her to be placed in a wheelchair for the rest of her life, his father, a psychiatrist, ships him off to boarding school. He also prescribes to him dozens of anti-depressant medications which cause him to feel numb to the world around him. Now a moderately successful actor, Andrew makes the decision to go cold-turkey off the prescription drugs he has taken for fifteen years and return home to reconcile not only with his estranged father but also with himself following the death of his mother in a bathtub. In the short time he spends back in New Jersey, he reconnects with all his old friends who have each gone their separate ways in the world and meets Sam, a girl who is everything that he isn't, who teaches him how to open himself up to the world. The story for Garden State, albeit adequately endowed with the comprehensive themes relative to the condition of the human spirit and the adolescent reflections upon life its key demographic necessitates, remains lax in terms of the script's focus and direction. Braff is hell-bent on presenting to his audience every little quirk and peculiarity he can recall about the state of New Jersey, some of which were well established long before this film came out, so much so that blowback occurs where in the pacing within the more somber moments of the movie feel way off from the rest of the picture. Another fortuitous result of these eccentric occurrences is that Garden State develops this tendency toward creating transitional sequences, most notably the one in which Method Man cameos as the operator of peeping-tom business in the back of a hotel, which serve no purpose in stimulating the storyline and only adds further hindrance to the movie's moderate pacing.<br /><br />For what it is worth, acclamation should be given to Zach Braff for a valiant effort in soliciting the responsibility of acting not only as the film's screenwriter and director but its leading man as well, all of which were firsts for him with Garden State. As anyone who has ever embarked on such a cinematic challenge of the limits of both patience and ambition, even for those not in their initial effort, can tell you, achieving the proper tone and style in which to win over the audience is an intricate balancing act so rarely achieved in the modern mainstream Hollywood environment. With that in mind, Braff's efforts in the role of Andrew Largeman, the protagonist of the picture, are like those of the character himself in that they are only moderately successful. Specific scenes opposite Portman or Holm in which they are seen interacting with each other through a segment of honest dialogue successfully demonstrates his proficiency in bringing out the intensity within his character, but at the same time fails to properly illustrate to his audience the dramatic shift in emotions Andrew experiences from the beginning to the end of the movie. Not to say that he should be seen on the floor near the end balling his eyes out but at least show some variance from the insipid, melancholic countenance expressed through nearly the entire picture. Natalie Portman gleams with this illuminating radiance in the role of Sam, the romantic interest of Andrew Largeman, and is suited perfectly opposite Braff in the charming subplot of the film, though it was felt as if this portion of the screenplay could have been expanded upon earlier rather then later in the picture, but in any case it works out fine. Though this is certainly not what one would consider as being Oscar-caliber material in the sense, still if Julia Roberts could be nominated for her rather simplistic role in Pretty Woman then anything is possible - as long as you play a hooker that is, she is a treasure to watch onscreen in this film nonetheless.<br /><br />Ian Holm, the brilliantly talented British actor more commonly remembered for his recent appearance as Bilbo Baggins in the highly successful Lord of the Rings trilogy, is greatly underutilized in the role of Andrew's father, Gideon Largeman. The rather intense interactions and conversational engagements held between Holm and Braff sprinkled sporadically throughout the film are intriguing and poignantly insightful into how divergent the relationship between father and son can become as a result of elevated variant emotions in regards to a single incident involving a loved one. The lack of development within this specific element of the screenplay is truly what made the end result of Garden State all the more disappointing to witness. Time would have been better spent concentrating on the elaboration of the anguish and resentment held for each other which has brought their relationship to a head at this point in their lives, rather then the mindless quirks of the town's residents. Speaking of which, Jean Smart's Carol (Mark's mother) and Armando Riesco's Jesse (a friend of Andrew's whose newfound wealth has stemmed from his creation of the silent Velcro) are two within the film's cast of quirky characters that should have been given something more valuable to do that would have merited their time and involvement in the project or else cut out entirely.<br /><br />Overall, in regards to the emotions Garden State invokes, it would appear as though art does imitate life - the intense anguish and sadness it produces from the prospects of what might have been make it nearly unbearable at times, but when all is said and done you do not regret having taken the ride. Putting it more sincerely, Garden State is not exactly a fantastic film, but there are enough memorable moments contained in it to make it at least recommended for someone else to watch. The film's most egregious oversight would unquestionably have to be its ending, which comes off as being half-assed and anti-climatic to audience members unreceptive to ludicrous clich&eacute;s. Sensing perchance that he could not tangibly achieve the "happily ever after" outcome that both he and his audience naively desired with the direction in which the story was heading toward, Braff in total disregard to the characters he created rashly ties up all the loose plot elements instead of allowing them be who they are. Although there is nothing unethical about using maledictions and nudity in movies, within reason of course, a complexity does arise when these are used in excess of what is necessary. And what was with Andrew Largeman going completely cold-turkey on the anti-psychotic medication his father prescribed for him? Having taken what would seem to be an exuberant amount of prescriptions for over fifteen, had he never heard of medical withdrawal? This is not a huge sticking point but realistically speaking this would not have been feasible and should not be recommended for anyone on with such considerable prescriptions. Instead the larger deliberation lies in what is presumed to be Braff's assumption which is that anti-depressant medication has made people numb to the world around them and that it has done far more harm then good, admirable their intentions or not. Although one can certainly argue that the modern generation has evolved into a society which has sought quick-fix solutions to their problems through prescription medication with little, if any, risk of side-effects, it would flat-out ignorant to believe all are unnecessary. Sure, there are those who take this medication for a condition they do not have, there is always a bad apple somewhere in the bunch, but a majority of them do need these prescriptions, in combination with psychological therapy, in order to restore the balance of their lives. And yes, there are no guarantees and uncertainties do occur in which the person may be placed in a high stress environment, but these risks need to be taken in order to reclaim a role in functional society. As much as we would like to, we can not logically shun away the world whenever we are hurt emotionally, or even physically, so we must learn to overcome these hindrances and move on with life, one way or another.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="My Favorite Horror Film!"></head><body><p>I ran out to buy univesal release of this dvd and the picture quality is great and the sounds also and now for the film! Halloween 2 jumps off right where the last one left off soon Jamie Lee Curtis is taken to the Hospital for evaluation and care and this is why halloween 2 is the perfect Horror film! Granted Michael Myers is the true star but here he takes a back seat to the Hosital! I like most people hjave a deathly fear of hospitals, maybe it's the smell of lysol or the fact that some check in but don't check out or the fact that even in the next room someone is dying and John Carpenter makes this the ultimate hospitalof horror! it's stark and empty the floors have a low grade sheen and the walls are a strange muted color and even the baby's ward is void of noise! When Myers makes hi sway into the hospital he turns into the Grim Reaper of mercy killing people with the precision of a ginsu! When he finally meets up with curtis his impsoing stature and slow creeping body overwhelm her and the viwer when a relentless Pleasence comes to her aid and they have the ultimate grude battle and Myers is wounded in th head by a bullet and blinded the swipes Myers takes at his sister (Curtis) with the blade slashing through the air with such a clear cut that sound alone makes this film worth the price. So sit back and watch out for two things on your next visit to the hospital; Myers and a missing scapel!</p></body></html>

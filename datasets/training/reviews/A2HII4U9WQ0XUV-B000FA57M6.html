Things have gone way south on a research base on Mars---or was it the Martian moon Phobos?---anyhoo, communications are dead, and the situation is totally FUBAR. You're sent to clean it up.<br /><br />You get hyper-jumped into the Phobos base, and mutated bloodthirsty zombies and demons and flesh-and-steel monstrosities in the thousands come to rip your face off. You blow them back into Hell. Rinse. Repeat. Boo-yah!<br /><br />Now: the formula for "Doom" wasn't anything profound, but it worked: it was pure, raw, nerve-rattling, brain-boggling adrenaline.<br /><br />Raw, pulsing adrenaline. The Gnomes at Id Software had found that magical servo, written it into gaming code, and hardwired it into our fitfully slumbering Reptile Brain.<br /><br />If you played "Doom", you found yourself, say, at about 11:00 P.M., with a load of schoolwork piled on the couch behind you, jacked into your computer, a sheen of sweat coating your greasy, slack-jawed, whey-skinned face. I swear to God, you said---just this level---just this next corridor---just to the Research Lab, honest to god, and then I'm going to go study/sleep/work.<br /><br />At 5 in the morning, you were still blasting Pinky Demons and dodging Imp Fireballs, and praying your boss/professor/chick-of-the-moment would understand, even as wan morning-light was feebly forcing its way through the blinds and curtains.<br /><br />So: when "Doom" first reared its ugly head, I wasn't expecting much. I didn't need much. I needed a few ready-for-bear, growing-and-spitting Space Marines. I needed a massed, hungry army of demons and hellspawn mutants, Stygian sinew fused cruelly with state-of-the-art Phobos military technology. I needed shotguns, and rocket launchers, and most definitely the BFG, laying waste to huge chunks of the Demon Horde and Martian real estate alike.<br /><br />Most importantly, I needed lots of slaughter. I wanted to be knee-deep in the Dead. What did I get with the cinematic "Doom"?<br /><br />1)There's very little to see---no seriously, this flick is Dark, as in it's underlit. If you spy a monster---and God knows, I was all eyes!---you'd better not blink, or you'll miss it.<br /><br />And the Phobos base comes off as your late-night Kansas City cheapo haunted house---lots of blind alleys and stairways and ramps and sh*t. Hell, we might as well be following the Rock (who plays "Sarge") through the local poultry warehouse.<br /><br />2) Turn off the Ultraviolence. Yep, "Doom" the movie is definitely toggled over to the "Don't Hurt Me" setting: we get a little gore thrown our way, but it's so minimal, so begrudging, and so tightly edited, that it might as well not be there at all.<br /><br />3) No Demons. Yeah, let's make a flick about marines slaughtering Demons on Mars and---well, skip the demons. Something about genomes and a propensity to evil. If I'd wanted to see a flick about socio-genetics, I'd have stayed in school. Bah Humbug.<br /><br />4) Oh, and no Hell. Did I mention that? "Doom" without a gateway to Hell.<br /><br />So---this review could go on. I could talk about Stan Winston fighting the good fight, doing some good critter prosthetics---and from what I could see of them, they *are* good. I could talk about The Rock's squinchy uni-brow. I could talk about how Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike (fraternal twins, according to the plot---a sort of spacefaring Sisters Grimm) spend much of the flick looking painfully constipated.<br /><br />I could even spend a few sentences yakking it up about the first-person shooter segment, meant as a nod to the fans, coming across as something you might see in a more desperate spookhouse at the Wichita County Fair.<br /><br />Or I could just say "Avoid", and be done with it.<br /><br />Game Over.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

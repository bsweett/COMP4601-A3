<meta name="summary" content="welles in top form"></head><body><p>This is a movie that can arguably be called the greatest movie ever made (and I lean towards the belief that it is one of the greatest movies ever made). The innovations Welles and Toland made in the cinematography and as a director were years and years ahead of their time. The makeup and art direction is Oscar Worthy. Even Robert Wise's editing was well done. Welles use lighting, the deep focus, long takes, and low angles was revolutionary. Sure, there are several plot holes and continuity goes all to hell, but you don't notice it. That's how much the movie captures you visually, and with the superb acting from Welles, Joseph Cotton, Everette Sloan, and Dorothy Comingore you don't notice until you've seen it several times. Oh, and before I forget, Hermann was the composer.<p>The DVD itself has a lot of great features, this is how a DVD should be made. It is a 2 disc set that is packaged beautifully in a slipcover case. There is commentary from Roger Ebert (who really analysis the film for you) and Peter Bogdanovitch, who was apparently a friend of Welles and has alot of great insights. You also get quick interviews with Ruth Warwick (the actress to portraits Kane's first wife) and Robert Wise (editor).<br />One major problem with the DVD is that in the storyboards, production stills, and call sheets you have no control over how fast they go. pretty much at the mercy of the DVD. <p>Disc 2 contains a 2 hour documentary on the Battle for Citizen Kane between Welles and Hearst.<p>It Citizen Kane the greatest movie ever made? I don't know, but certainly in the top five.</p></body></html>

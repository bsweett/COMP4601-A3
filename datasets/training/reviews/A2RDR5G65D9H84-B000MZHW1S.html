Clearly the intent was to bring to the forefront the issue of conflict diamonds in Africa. But instead of going for a factual film, the creators decided to throw together a group of great actors and a set of interesting sidelines to the story, polishing it into a magnificent jewel. The issue at hand is the brutal slaughtering in several parts of Africa, especially Sierra Leone, related to the control of diamonds. The situation in the movie is best described as TIA (This is Africa), a political mess, where those that govern only want to steal for their own benefit, and where there is no way to help, not even for the peace corps.<br /><br />Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a fisherman that dreams of his son, Dia, becoming a doctor and moving on to better things. This dream is stopped in its track when the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) comes to his village and brutally slaughters most of the inhabitants. Luckily, Solomon's family escapes, but the RUF captures him and takes him to work on the diamond fields as a slave. Meanwhile, politicians in the industrialized world are aware of the problem resulting from diamonds from conflict zones and there is an agreement not to buy them anymore. The big diamond houses in Europe and the US agree, but you probably know by now that they will go around it in one way or another.<br /><br />Then there is Danny (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is a local from Zimbabwe that gives arms to different guerrilla groups in exchange for diamonds and then smuggles them to Liberia, from where they can be imported into the consumer countries as conflict free rocks. When he is captured during one of his diamond operations, he is thrown in jail, where he meets Solomon. Solomon was in jail as a result of a raid of the RUF camp, but not before finding a big pink diamond that he hid underground. When the greedy Danny finds out about this, he makes sure that his future path is linked to Solomon's.<br /><br />Besides the greedy and unscrupulous Danny, and the moral Solomon, who just wants his family back, we have Maddy (Jennifer Connelly), a journalist that is frustrated by the situations she witnesses all around the globe and that wants her work to be effective in stopping the destruction. The three characters go through a journey of self-discovery while everyone around them is out to kill each other for the control of the diamonds. The situation is so bad that the different revolutionary groups kidnap and train children to join them. Seeing the transformation these young minds go through in a short time breaks your heart.<br /><br />The film definitely achieves its purpose of making people aware of the issues, and even though the story is gut-wrenching and some portions are extremely violent, I think that it was needed to convey the message clearly. What I did not expect before watching this movie was the outstanding performances I was going to witness. This is definitely DiCaprio's best. He even altered his accent to make it sound like a local and he does this very well. But he also has to play a character with multiple facets and that goes through somewhat of a transformation, and his performance really helps to make this believable. I have never heard of Hounsou before, but was impressed by the emotion he put into his role, and I am sure there will be many starring roles for him in the future. Jennifer Connely is the one I expected the best from, and she did not disappoint, since she delivers a performance on par to the one she gave us on excellent "The House of Sand and Fog". This is definitely one of the best releases of 2006, and if you can stomach the violence I believe you will agree.</p></body></html>

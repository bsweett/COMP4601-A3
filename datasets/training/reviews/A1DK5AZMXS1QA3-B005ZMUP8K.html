<meta name="summary" content="Craziest movie of 2006"></head><body><p>POTC2 received bad reviews from critics, yet fans loved it; as witnessed by the huge ticket sales both in the US and overseas.  It was the highest grossing movie of 2006, the most anticipated sequel of that year, and counter to what many critics claimed, a unique movie unto itself.  The first POTC was a great action-adventure flick, with scenes of situational comedy spliced in.  However, the action and the comedy were usually kept separate.  POTC2 is different in this respect; the comedy is inherent in the action scenes.  Examples include the swordfight in the water wheel, Jack's escape from the roasting pit, and the simultaneous escape of the Pearl's crew from the cannibals.  Hence whereas the first POTC had irony, sarcasm, wit and sitcom humor to provide the laughs, the second POTC relies on pure, unbridled, and very original slapstick.  The result is a mix of Three Stooges and Indiana Jones on the high seas.<br /><br />Similar to the first movie, POTC2 authentically recreates the sailing life and world pre-Industrial Revolution.  Whippings of crew members, superstitions, general illiteracy, and the looming power of large shipping companies (played by the East India Trading Company here) were everyday features of the seafaring life in the 1700s that are completely absent today.  This second POTC has many of the same tunes as the first POTC, with several key additions; most notably the music for the Flying Dutchman, the Kraken, and Davy Jones himself.<br /><br />This DVD contains the movie, some special features, but no extra scenes.  Overall, a great movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Man on the Moon: an inventive independent science fiction film, with a brilliant performance by Sam Rockwell"></head><body><p>In a not-so-distant future, Earth's energy is being supplied through extraction of Helium-3 from the Moon.  Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell, a space miner whose job is to make sure that the massive mining machines keep running and to ship the fuel they extract back to Earth.  He's at the tail end of a three year stint, and can't wait to go home -- and Gerty 3000, his robot companion whose design and mission is a significant twist from that of Hal 9000 (of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ASUM">2001 - A Space Odyssey</a>), seems worried he is beginning to lose focus on the mission.  It turns out Sam has much bigger issues to worry about.<br /><br />The German philosopher Martin Heidegger wrote that in an age of technology, where everything is treated as a resource, we ourselves become just another means to an end.  We think of technology as our servant, but humanity itself becomes another means to an end, a cog in the globalized technological machine.<br /><br />Director Duncan Jones has created a profound yet simple and small science fiction film that thematizes questions regarding the impact of technology on human life, how it affects human relations to each other, even what it means to be human.  The film feels like a return to some of the most intriguing science fiction of the seventies and the eighties, films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016I0AJG">Soylent Green</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063UR1">Silent Running</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000ILDD">Alien</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UD0ESA">Blade Runner</a>, even if it is working on a smaller scale than the last few of these.  (It's worth watching more than once for its inclusion of clever references to many of these films - the script and the setting include a number of subtleties, that are likely to be missed on first viewing.)  The production team obviously made the most of a small budget, and managed to create a very realistic moon base, and very convincing machines and subtle use of special effects.  Of course, the most impressive component of the film is the performance of Sam Rockwell, who almost singlehandedly carries the entire show, and gives a delicate and nuanced performance throughout.  This is excellent independent science fiction.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

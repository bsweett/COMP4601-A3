So begins an extended chase film and action movie.  Considering that Jason has amnesia and doesn't even remember his own name, you can hardly blame him for the mayhem that follows - he's just acting out of self-preservation.  With the help of Marie, he slowly begins to uncover details about his past, including the fact that that he was a highly trained CIA assassin involved in high level operations.  But now the CIA is trying to eliminate him - why?  While on the run from his own government, Bourne slowly makes a transition from confused amnesiac to an efficient combat machine, and at the end shows real touches of being sympathetic and human, even if this isn't entirely credible given his professional resume.  In fact throughout the story he comes across as genuinely concerned for the people close to him, and even while keeping the trained operatives at bay he's presented as a sympathetic character who isn't motivated by revenge or blood-lust, and any violence he causes only happens because there seems to be no alternative.<br /><br />As far as action films go, there's something refreshing about the way that The Bourne Identity has made the transition from Robert Ludlum's popular book to the big screen, despite significant changes to the original.  The plot features a spy thriller narrative reminiscent from the days of the Cold War (although with a post-Cold War setting here), and raises compelling questions immediately from the outset, as viewers share Jason's desperate questions to discover who he is, why he has bullet wounds in his back and details of a numbered Swiss bank account in his hip.  The chase scenes and suspense rarely disappoint, and even though the body count in the film is reasonably high, gore isn't the central interest, and even the fight sequences are for the most part about efficiency rather than eye candy - there's no unnecessary bullets or explosions, and the end result makes the action more believable.  The extended car chase early in the film is one of the best you'll see in the business. Parents should be forewarned about several instances of profanity and blasphemy, but fortunately these don't dominate the film, and even the chemistry between Bourne and his counterpart is muted and relatively tasteful.<br /><br />It's not suitable for children, but mature adults will find some decent entertainment here.  Much of it might be considered cliche and generic, but The Bourne Identity does a good job of it.  Fans of action thrillers will enjoy something that is fast and furious without becoming larger than life or over the top, and with a sympathetic fugitive that is just as much a man as a machine, and who has a real conscience.  This might not redeem the film from all its flaws, but it does go some ways to making it stand out from the average. - GODLY GADFLY</p></body></html>

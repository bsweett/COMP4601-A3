Breck Eisner's The Crazies, a remake of George Romero's 1973 film, addresses a similar issue when a peaceful town descends into chaos as the result of an unknown virus that turns people into the murderous crazies of the title. With so many horror films following this formula does The Crazies have anything unique to offer?<br /><br />The film begins in the town of Ogden Marsh in Iowa. We witness the town in flames before the story switches back two days to explain how the destruction began. Sinisterly we see satellite footage of the town and the words "initiate containment protocol" appear early in the film. Things begin normally at a baseball game but local sheriff David (Timothy Olyphant) and his deputy Russell (Joe Anderson) confront local resident Rory Hamill (Mike Hickman) who walks onto the field armed with a gun. When David moves in close he finds Rory unresponsive and when he raises his gun the sheriff has no choice but to kill Rory. This becomes the first of some bizarre incidents in the town and culminates in the discovery of a crashed plane in the nearby swampland. All too soon the military descend on the town, checking the temperature of all the locals and separating those with high temperatures as infected by an unknown virus. When David is separated from his wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) he must find a way to rescue and escape the town where the infected locals and the military have no hesitation in murdering anyone in their way.<br /><br />The opening reels of The Crazies are very intriguing with the shooting at the baseball game followed by a local farmer trapping his wife and child and burning their property to the ground. When the emergency services arrive he is outside and seemingly doesn't have a care in the world. The satellite view of the town and the military's sudden appearance cannot disguise who is responsible for the outbreak of the virus and that it is linked to the crashed plane that is found at the start of the film. When the army arrives they separate the locals with Judy being told she is infected because of a high temperature though she insists this is down to her being pregnant. David is powerless to stop her being taken away but when the locals are fenced off and told to await evacuation they find salvation in another local who drives through the perimeter and signals everyone to flee for their lives. David hooks up with his deputy Russell and they rescue Judy and another girl Becca (Danielle Panabaker) who have been strapped to beds in another part of the military facility. The quartet then begins their long journey away from the town and to safety.<br /><br />The Crazies certainly has some chilling moments, especially when more of the locals become infected. In one unnerving scene Judy, Becca and other locals who are presumed infected lie defenceless, strapped to their beds while carnage erupts outside as the perimeter fences are breached and the townspeople begin to escape. Suddenly a man enters the facility scraping a pitchfork along the ground and approaching those strapped to the beds. When they begin to weep he raises his pitchfork and proceeds to stab the locals in their beds! When the infected man is about to kill Becca, Judy cries out and he turns his attention to her! A further twist in the film comes in the form of David's deputy Russell who shows many susceptibilities to violence when the group make their escape from town and it is quite clear that he is infected as well.<br /><br />When I first saw the trailer for The Crazies I was drawn to it and believed it would be one of the better horror films of recent years. By the end I had enjoyed it but not as much as I had hoped I would. It's hard to say clearly what irked me about the film. It starts really well, building up the tension well as the virus spreads and the military come charging in but in the latter stages becomes very predictable. We learn during the film that the virus infects only certain people and if you have no symptoms after 48 hours then you're fine. With Judy being pregnant it's pretty obvious that she'll get through it and go on to have a child that will signal a new start. The deterioration of Russell as the virus takes hold could have been a lot better. His changing mood and increasing threats were good but once he realises what he's becoming the film descends into melodrama which doesn't work considering the farmer that killed his wife and child without a care in the world. The good thing is the film has one of those endings that will make you smile and could leave this open for a sequel.<br /><br />The Crazies is one of the better horror films of recent years though it does carry some flaws. There are some great scenes with the infected locals lashing out at friends and family without hesitation and the entrance of the military and their approach to dealing with the crisis are sinister and chilling moments indeed. This isn't as good as I had hoped but is still worth a look.</p></body></html>

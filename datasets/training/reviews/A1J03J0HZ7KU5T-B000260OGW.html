<meta name="summary" content="A Solid Western in the Classic Tradition"></head><body><p>After the stunning fiascos of "The Postman," "Wyatt Earp" and "3000 Miles to Graceland," director-actor Kevin Costner makes a long-overdue comeback with "Open Range" (2003). Though flawed, it's nice to see a traditional western that wholeheartedly embraces its cliches. The teaming of Costner with Robert Duvall is truly inspired and lends an emotional power to the film. Costner works best when paired with seasoned veterans such as Duvall - in fact, both actors should venture into western territory more often. An excellent cast (Annette Bening, Michael Gambon, the late Michael Jeter) and James Muro's exquisite cinematography lift this familiar range-war saga well above the ordinary, with director Costner utilizing the Alberta landscape to memorable effect. "Open Range" might have been a great western if Costner had made a few judicious cuts (the 139-minute running time is way too long) and hired a better composer than Michael Kamen, whose derivative score lacks spark and resonance. Still, it remains a film worth having in an era where movie westerns are a dying breed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Exciting Suspense Thriller!!"></head><body><p>Normally, I am not fond of Nicole Kidman's acting abilities, but in this movie, I was pretty impressed with her skills in playing the part of Sylvia Broome a multilingual interpreter at the United Nations.<br /><br />Sylvia Broome overhears a death threat against a controversial African leader, but is unable to identify the speaker due to the circumstances. She reports what she hears only to have the Secret Service not believe what she has to say. In fact, the Secret Service thinks Sylvia Broome may be a part of the plot her self as she has a reason not to like African political leader.<br /><br />Sean Penn plays the part of Tobin Keller and is assigned to investigate Sylvia Broome to see if what she has to say has any merit what so ever. The movie becomes a fast paced, suspenseful, political thriller and is fun to watch!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Scarier Than the First"></head><body><p>"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" is a good sequel to "Harry Potters and the Socerer's Stone". Much like the first movie, "Chamber of Secrets" is full of magic and fantasy. However, this film is much scarier than the first, something the surprised me a little. Even though I read the books, I was a little surprised by how graphic and violent some of the fight scenes were.<p>Even though some of the scenes may have been a little too much for younger children, I would still recommend watching this film. I doubt there is a Harry Potter fan out there who hasn't, but those of you who aren't, this is a film to at least check out.</p></body></html>

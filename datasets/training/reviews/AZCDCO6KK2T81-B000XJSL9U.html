<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable popcorn fun, but disappointing entry in the franchise."></head><body><p>I am a big fan of both Bruce Willis, who seems to move so easily from one genre to another, and the Die Hard films.  I was looking very forward to this film and happy to see the PG-13 rating which meant the extreme foul language and vivid violence of the previous films was now toned down to have wider audience appeal.  Some may feel this was a serious flaw with this entry, but I'm okay with this change.  However, I am not okay with the general storyline and this entry's villain as it is written and acted.<br /><br />While Justin Long makes a great sidekick for Willis and is very believable in his role, Timothy Olyphant is never believable as the villian and the plot's mix of his reasons for crippling the nation's technological infrastructure is completely silly.  First, he claims he's doing this to "save America" from "real" terrorists since he was fired and discredited when he demonstrated our nation's vulnerability.  Then he claims he should be paid for enlightening America and attempts a grand robbery.  Whether its Olyphant's inability to demonstrate any believable emotion or because the script is ludicrious, I just can't feel anything about the villain which was a major point with the prior films as they had very different, but interesting and engaging bad guys.<br /><br />The action and stunt work is awesome, but less believable than the prior films.  It all has that "we've got $100 million to blow and here it is" feel to it.  They really don't propel the story very much and while impressive, they really don't mean so much which, again, is contrary to the other films.  It's action for action's sake, thus, it feels rather empty.<br /><br />Inspite of my negative comments here, I did enjoy this film.  I just don't think it can hold a candle to the first three in which I gave four stars to each of them for originality, believable (most of the time) action, consistently good villains, and great casting.  This film just has too many faults in the areas that made the others so enjoyable and memorable.  I saw this film two weeks ago in the theatres and except for one or two scenes, I've just about forgotten the whole film already and that is not true of the first three which I still recall vividly.</p></body></html>

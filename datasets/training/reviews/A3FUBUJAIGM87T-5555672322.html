<meta name="summary" content="The best of the Friday the 13th/Jason series.  Great movie!!"></head><body><p>First, let me preface this review by saying that if you don't like slasher/horror flicks to begin with, then you sure as hell aren't going to like "Friday the 13th part 3", but if you are a fan of the genre then you are in for a treat with this one.  Still, with that being said, some horror movie fans and critics alike would disagree with my assertion that "Friday the 13th part 2" and/or "Friday the 13th part 3" are the best of the "Friday the 13th" series and those people would clearly be wrong.  The acting and scripts for parts 2 & 3 are without a doubt superior to the other movies.  Steve Miner did an outstanding job with both Friday the 13th part 2 and 3, which are also the most dynamic movies of the series, and while one could legitimately argue that part 2 is technically superior than part 3 in the sense of being scary (it's a tough call, but Jason with the hood and his style in part 2 was scarier in my opinion), I think that part 3 has a little extra something that makes it a little more interesting than part 2.  I should say that I think the score is even better for "Friday the 13th part 3" with the advent of that funky-scary music that we get in the opening credits of this brilliant horror flick.<br /><br />At any rate, part 3 starts out recapping what happened at the end of "Friday the 13th part 2".  Immediately following the part 2 murders, the audience is introduced to a very attractive young lady named Chris who has had a traumatic and mysterious confrontation with Jason Voorhees.  Chris is trying to overcome her fear of this past experience by going back to the "scene of the incident" if you will.  Hence, you have the plot of this movie in a somewhat different setting than the other Friday 13th flicks.  I like this underlying theme of the mysterious attack by Jason Voorhees against Chris...I think it really sets the tone and provides an interesting and refreshing perspective for this series.<br /><br />Chris and her friends return to the cabin location and Chris tries to deal with her fears and her memory of the horrible attack.  I thought the addition of the barn was a terrific arena for horror with this type of movie...you have it all in this one: the woods, the barn and the cabins...great setting for what is a great slasher flick.  Meanwhile, while Chris and friends are arriving at the cabin, Jason has just finished a massive killing spree and is hungry for more blood, and of course, Chris in her crew are most definitely in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br /><br />In "Friday the 13th part 3", we have more dynamic characters and better character development in general; this is where part 3 is slightly better than part 2, although I did like Paul and Ginny as well.  For instance, in part 3, Shelley provides an interesting character as he is a weird kind of fellow with an inferiority complex.  He constantly engages in morbid-like pranks with gore in which he tricks everyone into thinking he has been brutally murdered.  This sets the tone for later of course when Jason actually kills Shelley and it is a really great scene when Shelley is finally discovered dead for real.  Also, I really loved the advent of the biker crew...I thought the little altercation between Shelley and the bikers was an interesting and fun subplot.  The actors who played Ali, Fox and Loco were outstanding.  In fact, Ali is a dangerous man in his own right and provides Jason with some combative competition...okay, not much competition but he's better than the girls he ends up losing to in the end.  I must admit that my favorite part of the movie is when Fox is swinging on that rope on the second floor of that barn and Loco reprimands her while she is having such a good time and then when he looks back, Fox aint there no more...I guess she found Jason somewhat more formidable than that little girl she bullied in the grocery mart.<br /><br />Anyway, Jason disposes of his prey in the usual fashion with some creativity.  In fact, I really love the murder scene when that guy is always walking with his hands and eventually runs into Jason. OUCH!!!  But, by and large, the acting and script for this movie is just superior to the others...I give "Friday the 13th part 3" a slight but distinct edge over "Friday the 13th part 2" from that perspective.  Steve Miner did a brilliant job with both movies and both are slasher classics and must own DVDs for horror movie fans.<br /><br />As an interesting point of trivia, Jason donnes the notorious hockey mask in "Friday the 13th part 3"...it belonged to Shelley and was rudely stolen from him after his gruesome demise.<br /><br />"Friday the 13th part 3" is one of the very best slasher flicks ever and is an absolute must own for all serious and sophisticated horror movie fans.  Anyone who thinks this is bad slasher flick obviously has no idea what he/she is talking about.  Enjoy Jason's finest and buy "Friday the 13th part 3"...you'll be glad you did as you can watch this one over and over again...a solid 4 STAR slasher-horror flick.</p></body></html>

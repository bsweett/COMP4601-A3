<meta name="summary" content="One of the better recent bio-pics"></head><body><p>The assassination of Harvey Milk and the mayor of SF happened in the late 70s and is a somewhat forgotten, though shocking, episode in the gay rights movement. This Sean Penn vehicle nicely brings it all back, and the result is high quality all down the line. Penn's performance is very good. He seems to be making a little specialty of these politically minded bio-pics. I also liked his "All the King's Men," though not everyone did. It's hard to remember just how rough gays had it only a few years ago, and in San Francisco, of all places.</p></body></html>

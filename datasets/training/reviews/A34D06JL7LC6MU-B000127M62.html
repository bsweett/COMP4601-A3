<meta name="summary" content="A Great Action Film."></head><body><p>The long awaited &quot;Freddy vs.Jason&quot; was well worth the wait considering the makeup and the good script.The movie isn't the best in either series however it IS better than the last two installments &quot;Wes Cravens New Nightmare&quot; and &quot;Jason X&quot;.The film had some pretty good writers and a great script making the movie a must see for Freddy/Jason fans.The film starts out with an intro depicting how Freddy died and was sent to hell after the kids on Elm street forgot about him making him lose his power.<br />But when Freddy finds a way to get his power back by sending the immortal hockey faced slasher Jason Voorhees to remind people about him.Stuck in the web of terror are a couple of teenagers who are trying to bring the deadly duo together for the &quot;Ultimate Showdown of Terror&quot;.The film does have a semi predictable ending and I think does need a sequel although the film fell off the top 10 charts after four weeks.The makeup effects are great and the special features are top notch including an aternate ending,and 18 deleted scenes,this is a must have DVD for horror fans.</p></body></html>

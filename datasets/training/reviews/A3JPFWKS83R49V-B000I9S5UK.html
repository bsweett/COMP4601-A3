<meta name="summary" content="Cops and Criminals Join Together to Fight a Common Enemy"></head><body><p>Hollywood remakes are usually weak, but this remake of the 1976 movie is a pretty good one, with some good suspense and drama. It stars Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne in the main roles, with a pretty good supporting cast of heroes and villains.<br /><br />The storyline of this movie involves a gang of men who attack a police precinct where a mob member (played by Fishburne) is being held prisoner. They attack because they are trying to get this guy. As a result, the cops and prisoners decide to take up arms together to fight this outside enemy. They are still adversaries and they distrust each other. But they know they must join forces if they want to win this battle.<br /><br />Is a plot like this realistic? Possibly, and the characters make it seem halfway believable. But some parts of this movie aside from the plot itself make it seem unreal. For one thing, the guys inside the precinct- both cop and criminal- seem a little too cool. They know they are under attack, but they act very relaxed about the whole thing, which isn't much like reality. Second, there is little intervention taking place on the outside. If something like this really happened, I would think (hope) the outside world would quickly be made aware and would send help. Or, at the very least, there would be reporters and local people gathered around while the event was taking place. In this movie, there is really nothing at all on the outside. No one in Detroit (where the movie is set) seems to care at all that this police precinct is under siege.<br /><br />Still, I think this is a good movie to watch. If nothing else, it is worth watching just to see Laurence Fishburne in action. He and Hawke steal the show with their chemistry and their strength of person and character.</p></body></html>

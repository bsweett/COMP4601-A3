<meta name="summary" content="a psychic film distinguished by fabulous acting"></head><body><p>I am not usually one for fantasy films about psychics and the afterlife, but this one has such depth  that I could suspend my disbelief and feel completely engrossed in the emotions of the characters.  I have never seen acting so fine and vivid in this genre.  It is moving, beautiful, mysterious, and psychologically real.  I think it is a masterpiece.<br /><br />The film starts with the 2004 tsunami that devastated Indonesia.  A French woman is swept up in the wave, receiving a terrible blow in the head that brings her near death while submerged.  What she sees changes her life, alienating her from her past and its certainties.  She loses everything.  Meanwhile, we learn about a young man from San Francisco, a psychic who is searching desperately for a way to live and love with his "ability".  Every time he sees a potential relationship, it seems, his ability destroys his chances.  He is not helped by his brother, who is pushing to exploit his ability as a business concern.  The third character is a boy, whose mother is a junkie and who loses someone near to him.  He is pitifully depressed and seeking answers while in fostercare.<br /><br />How their lives intersect is the plot of the story.  However, the theme - of being able to move on with one's life - is wonderfully evoked by Eastwood, who is one of the greatest filmmakers alive.  Every gesture and expression of the 3 characters moved me, their struggle and melancholy totally believable, at least to me, as they search for resolution and a way forward.  It brought tears to my eyes, perhaps because I lost my father not too long ago.  The film actually helped me to mourn.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  I know it isn't for everyone, but it sure worked for me.</p></body></html>

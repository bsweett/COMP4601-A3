<meta name="summary" content="KONG! 8th Wonder of the World!"></head><body><p>I grew up watching this great classic and every single time had the same thrills over and over again, this one truly withstands the test of time, fascinating me just as much at 57 as it did at eight years old.<br /><br />When Armstrong first encounters a down-on-her-luck Wray, he offers her this magical job without revealing his true intent, and onboard the ship, he has her practice screaming in front of the camera, which moves one of the crew to ask: "What does he really expect her to see?" Chilling, foreboding moment...<br /><br />The journey to Skull Island on the ship really gets you worked up for the entry onto the island itself and the encounter with the Natives, the various monsters behind the great gate (used in the burning of Atlanta in GWTW) and finally, Kong himself.<br /><br />Robert Armstrong delivers the movie's sole humorous line when the Native Chief is taken with Fay Wray and wants to trade livestock for her, Armstrong says "Yes, I guess blondes are kinda scarce around here."<br /><br />Once they get past the gate and into the jungle, things take off in a hurry. The trip by boat to another part of the island has one of the (still, to this day) scariest moments I have ever seen in any movie of the genre; a water monster that is truly terrifying. When I was a child, this monster really scared me witless.<br /><br />Eventually Fay Wray, what's left of the crew and Kong are delivered safely back to New York and it is at that point my fear of Kong changed to one of pity. The poor guy, taken out of his home, to a foreign environment, treated like a sideshow freak and placed in iron restraints, it was really awful to see. When, at the end, he is on the top of the Empire State Building, fighting off the airplanes, and loses the battle, I cried.<br /><br />And Armstrong's last line, the perfect summation of Kong's trials: "It wasn't the airplanes, it was beauty killed the beast."<br /><br />GREAT movie, and fascinating to note Fay Wray only died last year! Born in 1907 and starred in one of the most famous films of all time...amazing.</p></body></html>

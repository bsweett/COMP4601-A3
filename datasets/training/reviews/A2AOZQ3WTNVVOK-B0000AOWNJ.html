<meta name="summary" content="Creepy Chiller"></head><body><p>A truly scary movie confuses you and chills you with the unexpected, the unknown, and occasionally, the incomprehensible.  "The Ring" gives you all this and more.<p>This film continues a recent trend in horror movies of taking place in a setting we all know that likely exists in our own home.  We have a comfortable familiarity with electronics, safe and snug with the doors locked.  The horror that finds us sounds much like an urban legend.  Watch a mysterious, bizarre videotape that causes fear in some, and others to scoff at its amateurish style and technique.  Moments after watching the videotape, the phone rings and a voice says, "seven days."  Seven days later the watcher of the video dies with a most horrible expression of fear on their face.<p>Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) learns of this urban legend when her niece dies in a most disconcerting way, and a friend who was with her becomes insane.  Rachel tries to back track recent events that happened to her niece and friend and discovers an unlabeled videotape in a remote mountain lodge.  Not yet believing the urban legend, Rachel watches the videotape.  The phone rings, and the fear begins.<p>Soon joining Rachel is her ex-husband Aidan (David Dorfman), and even more frighteningly, her son.  Hoping that the story isn't true, yet knowing she cannot wait for the end, Rachel begins following the clues in the video to determine whether there is a way of keeping from dying.  We discover with Rachel and Aidan in a journey that fits all the pieces together that every image in the movie has meaning.<p>The ending of the movie was a bit of a let-down, and yet almost as creepy as the movie itself.  As with many movies, especially horror movies, the ending can make or break a movie and the ending of this movie almost undoes all the excellence of the movie's body.<p>This movie is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen, and the best I've seen recently.  Elements of the movie are similar to "Fear Dot Com," which was also chilling and bloodier, but not as creepy and ominous as "The Ring."  I enjoyed how all the elements of the movie were tied together for those with the diligence to keep track of imagery throughout.  Horror movies always play better when ambiance and a growing sense of fear win out over the splatter of unnecessary and excessive blood.</p></body></html>

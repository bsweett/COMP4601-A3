<meta name="summary" content="An inglorious triumph for Tarantino!"></head><body><p>1944 Nazi-Ocupied France, it seems Adolf Hitler (Martin Wuttke) with his troops are taking over the country and killing off Jews. American soldier Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) with a group of  Jewish-American Soldiers (Eli Roth, Christoph Waltz, Til Schweiger, B.J. Novak, Omar Doom, Michael Bacall, Paul Rust, Samm Levine) who call themselves the Basterds as they spread terror and fear to every Nazi in europe. They run across with a beautiful French-Jewish woman named Shoshana (Meline Laurent) who's family was brutally killed by the Nazis as she runs a local movie theater in Paris to get revenge.<br /><br />Featuring appearences by Mike Myers, Julie Dreyfuss, Rod Taylor, Diane Kruger and Bo Stevenson this is one hell of a Quentin Tarantino action-war thriller. Some people love this movie or hate it but i loves it since Quentin never fails me! i believe this is a unique and ultraviolent character study that breaks up in 5 parts like Pulp Fiction back in 1994 did with 3 parts in one movie. I love how this mixes history and fiction combined as the director knows how to do it right and i know the film is a bit slow paced for some but this was a delight to watch. It has a mix of art-house and mainstream all combined in one, if you like a good quality action-drama-character flick then i suggest checking this movie out.<br /><br />The movie looks and sounds terrific in High-Def even with that theater quality on the sound with the parts during the war sequences. The Extras are terrific such as trailers, interviews, featurettes, poster gallery, camera angel feature, and extended & alternate scenes.</p></body></html>

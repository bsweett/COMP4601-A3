The only thing we lose here is the big-screen.  But we get so much more; screen-takes, documentaries, etc.  This DVD was produced very nicely, the picture and sound quality are quite good, the dialogue is crisp and the menus were easy to navigate.  Throw in John Williams' awesome score and what is there to complain about!?  The film retains just enough humor (witness interaction between Hackman and Beatty) to remind us that it is after all based on a COMIC BOOK (emphasis added for you detractors...)  How can you not enjoy Lex yelling "MS. TESSMACHER!!!!" or Williams amusing musical cues for Beatty's character?  Chris Reeves now embodies the persevering spirit of a character he played decades ago.  More power to you Chris.  Enjoyable, life-affirming, and classic.<p>Essential.</p></body></html>

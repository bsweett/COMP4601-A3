Actors in the 20s, usually get passed over on the assumption that they've got plenty of time to prove themselves over the course of their careers.  (I believe Adrien Brody's recent win for THE PIANIST made him the youngest winner ever--and he was pushing 30 by that point.)  Of course, cinema historians may find Norton's loss to the now somewhat discredited Roberto Benigni particularly galling (at least give it to Nolte or McKellan who were also up for the award that year--but Benigni fever, however benign it was, was running rampant that year and dictated otherwise).<br /><br />Norton's performance, as is generally acknowledged, is a tour-de-force.  Aside from his age, the other thing that worked against him as far as recognition from the Academy goes was the disturbing nature of the film.  Many reviewers have noted that the very articulateness with which Norton's character Derek expounds his racist views is downright scary.  One cannot dismiss him--as one can with nearly all of his neo-Nazi colleagues--as a complete ignoramus.  Even the supposedly canny and diabolically charismatic group leader, Cameron (Stacy Keach) is pretty much a cypher.  At the very least, Keach needed more screen time to establish why he was able to exert such a hold over Venice Beach's alienated white youth.  Do such groups really rely on middle aged Nazi gurus for inspiration?<br /><br />The failure to develop Keach's character is only one of many dramatic flaws--many of which have been detailed by other reviewers below and elsewhere.  The relatively short term (three years) that Derek serves in prison seems unlikely.  His in-prison conversion, mainly through the influence of a black inmate who befriends, him is certainly plausible, but also a little cliched.  The outreach efforts of a former teacher, also African-American, rings a bit truer but is also a bit dramatically suspect.  Finally, one could argue that someone as intelligent as Derek would not be so quick to reveal his change of heart to potentially dangerous former colleagues without first having made some provisions for his family's and his own safety and security.<br /><br />In short, there are gaps in the plot that you could drive a semi through.  That does not make the film--and Norton's performance--anything less than gripping, however.  The film's ending, which some may find a bit heavy handed, at least serves to remind the viewer that neither Derek's moral transformation not that of his younger brother (which Derek has begun to help effect) can prevent tragedy.  It is a final, powerful reminder that the cycle of hate is nearly impossible to break.<br /><br />For those who might be doing some programming or who simply like to do their own in-house double bills, consider running this film along with Mathieu Kassovitz's equally hard hitting HATE (LA HAINE).</p></body></html>

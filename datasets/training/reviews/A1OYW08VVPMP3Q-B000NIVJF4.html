<meta name="summary" content="A look at a forgotten chapter in African history"></head><body><p>Set in the backdrop of the east African country of Uganda, this is a fictional account of young Doctor Garrigan, a Scot who wishes to escape the promise of a humdrum life in his native country and who travels to Uganda on a whim to do humanitarian work. He arrives just as General Idi Amin Dada takes over the country in a coup, overthrowing a corrupt regime and apparantly replacing it with a populist government. Garrigan becomes Amin's personal physician and slowly begins to get sucked into the madness that overwhelms Uganda as Idi Amin brutally eliminates his enemies, real and imagined, expels the Asians who run the small country's economy and establishes an oppressive regime of his own.<br /><br />The film certainly captures the look and feel of Africa of that time, with many details you might not notice if you didn't know to look for them. The film does allow itself to reflect unnecessarily graphic violence and nudity, though. One thing I thought was interesting was how such a low-born uneducated man like Amin was able to charm the media, especially during one key TV event, and the answer is obvious: they WANTED to be charmed, they WANTED to be fooled. It is a trend that goes on today.<br /><br />The addition of actual historical footage at the end of some of the events of Idi's regime was a nice touch. It shows that yes, this really did happen or something awfully close to it.</p></body></html>

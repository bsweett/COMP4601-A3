<meta name="summary" content="the old school gold"></head><body><p>stumbled upon this wonderful set like new (flawless) in a buy , sell and trade store here in certal florida . only 15.00 bucks . man what a deal . "PLANET" gets ***** out of ***** from me . classic stuff . "BENEATH" i'd lob **** out of ***** . nearly as much fun . "ESCAPE" would cop **** out of ***** here . love that goofy stuff and unforgiving ending . "CONQUEST" gets ***1/2 out of ***** from me . good will , KHAN and fond memories of ape violence . "BATTLE" i'd award *** out of ***** . for having the stones to put PAUL WILLIAMS and JOHN HUSTON in prosthetics . the "DOCU" receives ***** out of ***** because of RODDY narrative and length and interesting content . if you're of a certain age (say 45 and up) and you're a sci-fi fan , you pretty much need this collection as sort of a membership to the pre-CG-WHY fan club . you know you belong . don't let 'um wow you with their 200 million dollar + budgets . this is the strait dope . mainline it .</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="LXG is no Spiderman, yet it is fun and witty...."></head><body><p>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is the kind of film that, in order to enjoy it, you need to leave your sense of disbelief at home (or, if you are at home, leave it in the closet).  It also helps if you have read either the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill or any of the classic adventure novels from which the League's characters are borrowed (King Solomon's Mines, Dracula, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, The Portrait of Dorian Grey, just to name a few).  If you embrace the idea that this is a popcorn-adventure movie and not one of those serious Oscar-contending films, then you'll have a good time.  <p>As comic-book-based movies go, LXG isn't on the same legendary adaptation level as Superman: The Movie or Spiderman.  Nevertheless, the conceit of uniting some of the best adventure/fantasy characters from late 19th Century literature and pitting them against a clever wannabe world dominator in order to stop a world war in 1899 is not exactly a bad one.  And of course it helps to have Sean Connery (Dr. No, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) as the head of an ensemble that includes TV's La Femme Nikita's Peta Wilson, Shane West, Stuart Townsend and Jason Fleming.  As legendary hunter Allan Quatermain Connery (who's also executive producer of this project) exudes world-weary cynicism and a sense of honorable duty as he leads a group of literary superheroes on a quest to stop the mysterious Fantom, a war-hungry arms merchant/inventor who seeks to pit the European superpowers against each other.  Of course, it's up to the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to stop this madman and preserve world peace (at least until 1914!).<p>Screenwriter James Dale Robinson and director Stephen Norrington keep things moving at a brisk pace, and the whole movie sparkles with a sense of fun and humor that was clearly lacking in both Daredevil and The Hulk, both of which are examples of how not to make a comic book movie.  LXG succeeds where many of this genre don't, partly because it doesn't take itself too seriously, but mostly because it is fast-paced and dares to take chances.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great horror movie, full of shocks & twists"></head><body><p>This is the best of the Saw movies by a long chalk. It's gripping and twisted, with some great shocks in it and a very good hold on the viewer. It's gory & it's got some very good surprises in it, as well as setting the audience up for one surprise after another. An excellent film.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></body></html>

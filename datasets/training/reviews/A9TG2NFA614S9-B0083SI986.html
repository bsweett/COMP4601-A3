<meta name="summary" content="This Gran Torino May Be an Edsel"></head><body><p>"Gran Torino" begins with a grim, crusty, bigoted Clint Eastwood (Walt Kowalski) who has just become a widower. Living with him must have been an act of penance for his devoutly Catholic wife. A very persistent boyish-looking priest in his late twenties has promised Clint's wife that he'll get the old codger to confession.<br />He has two sons and some grandkids who are self-centered, mean, and hateful, but they are also rubrics rather than real people. With a patriarch like Eastwood, it's little wonder they turned out so nasty.<br />He lives in a well-kept single family home in a nice neighborhood that's been taken over by Southeast Asians (Hmongs). Clint's prize possessions are an antique Ford Gran Torino (he worked on the Ford Detroit assembly line for many years) and an M-1 rifle from his service in Korea.<br />Over the years Eastwood's voice has grown hoarser, more gravelly, more strained and harder to distinguish. He's a dinosaur of the American film industry but still a national treasure.<br />The plot is formulaic, melodramatic and predictable. Eastwood is gradually won over by his Asian neighbors, especially the son and daughter next door. He becomes a mentor for the son and has to prevent the boy from becoming prey for the local Asian gang. Eastwood at first resorts to his guns with vestiges of his Dirty Harry image coming to the fore.<br />Eastwood has perfected a screen persona that is difficult for him to step out of. Even his walk is iconic. It probably would be better for him to let someone else direct a picture like this so it wouldn't turn into a star vehicle.<br />The ending is a surprise in a movie that needs a jolt of originality. It's not a bad movie, but it's not great either.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A truly unique, visionary motion picture"></head><body><p>The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the few truly visionary motion pictures of the last couple of decades.  The bizarre story is one only Tim Burton could tell, and he brings that story to life with some of the most impressive animation I've ever seen.  Stop-motion animation requires infinite care and patience to create, and one could easily forgive any slight hitches that result - but you'll find no imperfections at all here, as the animation rolls along beautifully and naturally.  As for the story, I found it good but not great, but the dark and imaginative vision behind it all more than makes up for any flaws in the writing.<br /><br />Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown, has grown bored of all the scary shenanigans to which his land is dedicated to producing, finding little joy in topping his past accomplishments each year.  Wandering off alone, lost in thought, he happens to come across a sort of holiday crossroads, which leads him to Christmas Town.  It's a world like nothing he's ever seen before, and the Christmas magic quickly captures his heart and soul - so much that he returns home to refashion Halloweentown in the guise of Christmas Town.  He has a hard time communicating the spirit of Christmas to the townsfolk, but his perseverance pays off in the transition of the local industry from scary items to Christmas toys and gifts (unfortunately, gifts such as shrunken heads aren't exactly what little Johnny or his parents are particularly looking for).  As Christmas approaches, Jack prepares to don the red suit and white beard, hook up his remodeled coffin sleigh to the reindeer created by the local mad scientist, and sail off into the night to deliver toys to all the good little boys and girls - after he has the real Santa Claus kidnapped, of course.  Only Sally, a rag doll who loves Jack from afar, sees just what a disaster this is in the making.  With Santa suffering torture at the hands of the Bogeyman, it looks like Christmas is doomed for sure.<br /><br />I don't see this as a children's movie, although children will no doubt be delighted by all of the dark and wacky animation.  I also found the somewhat rushed ending somewhat ambiguous, especially in terms of Jack's feelings for good old Halloween.  Still, the film does evoke the Christmas spirit somewhat and certainly proves entertaining with its wonderful soundtrack, incredible animation, and dark humor.</p></body></html>

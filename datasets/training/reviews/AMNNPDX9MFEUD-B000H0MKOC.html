<meta name="summary" content="Refreshingly intelligent satire"></head><body><p>Aaron Eckhart is fast becoming one of my favorite actors to watch (The Dark Night and Conversations with Other Women both showcase his talent) but my interest started with his excellent portrayal of a lobbyist for the tobacco industry in this great movie.<br />It's hard to find fault in Thank You For Smoking. It features an intelligent script, sharp and disciplined acting, and smooth yet brisk pacing. There are plenty of laughs, a perfect dose of heart, and a filleting of not only the lobby world, but of government, Hollywood, power, and the gullible American public that is surgically precise. There are no punches pulled here, Eckhart leads a brilliant cast of actors and Thank You For Smoking is easily one of the best satire comedies I have seen in a long time. When you look at how much praise Tropic Thunder got for trying (unsuccessfully) to pull off the same skewering satire, it should make you appreciate a gem like TYFS that much more. This is highly recommended.</p></body></html>

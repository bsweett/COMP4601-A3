<meta name="summary" content="I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!  OUTSTANDING!!!"></head><body><p>I had no idea what I was in for when I decided to watch "Snatch," but am I ever glad I took the time to watch this movie.  Let me say this: this has to be THE BEST CRIME CAPER MOVIE I have ever seen!  Wow, this is such a great movie...I don't know what else to say.<p>Just imagine a caper movie where everything that could possibly go wrong does.  Imagine a movie where different conflicts and interests drags all of these characters together in a unpredictible situation.  Imagine.....a dog that can swallow an entire squeeze toy ball??  Very possible in this movie, in fact, that's all I can tell you.  I don't want to give anything away.<p>Performances in this movie: very top knotch.  Brad Pitt once again shows how talented of an actor he is (and you can't even understand what the hell he's saying!!!!).  The writing is very original and clever, bringing tons of twists, crazy characters, and the most ridiculous scenarios to the tablle; with the end result being a very ingenious movie where everything all comes together and makes sense.  Brilliant directing, as well.  I like the slow-motion sequences; very clever and well-structured.<p>The DVD is very high quality as well.  Lots of special features, concidering this is a two disk set.  Haven't gotten through all of them, yet, but I liked what I saw.  The picture quality is very good and the sound quality is off the hook.  I was amazed by how good this movie sounded.  I'll have to get the soundtrack if I get the chance.<p>Despite what critics may think, this is a very clever and hillarious crime caper that will have you laughing like you would never believe.  This is one I will be sure to watch over and over again.  I am sorry if I couldn't get into too much detail about the story, but that would ruin the movie.  The best part of the movie is that it catches you off guard, showing you something you would never expect.  I went into seeing this movie without knowing a thing about it, except that is was a caper movie.  I am glad I didn't read any reviews that would give away the story.  All in all, "Snatch" is an amazing film that pulls no punches.  See this one as soon as possible!  I loved every minute.</p></body></html>

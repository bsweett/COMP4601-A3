She's the girl all the guys love and the women envy. She can throw down shots of tequila with the guys on the one hand and go shoe shopping with her girls on the other. So far in her career, she's played the live-wire, the over-achiever, the most elegantly dressed...the sexiest, friendliest, the most dazzling.<br />Not so in Curtis Hanson's (the sublime "LA Confidential") "In her Shoes." Diaz's Maggie Feller is a forlorn thief and drunk and more to the point a loser. Diaz's incandescent beauty is even dulled here: she's all dolled up, yes but underneath it all she is tragically sad.<br />I've always believed that the bond between siblings is the strongest bond in anyone's life and Maggie's bond with her older sister Rose (the terrific Toni Collette) is the backbone of this story: they hate each other, they love each other and they can't live with or without one another. Rose and Maggie have fought side-by-side on the battlefield of family deception and misunderstanding. They are comrades.<br />Director Hanson's movies always reek of the aroma of well observed life and relationships and "In Her Shoes" is no exception to this rule. But, in this case you can also marvel at Cameron Diaz's transformation into an important and serious actress of the first order.</p></body></html>

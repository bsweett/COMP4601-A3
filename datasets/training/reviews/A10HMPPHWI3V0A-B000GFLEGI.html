<meta name="summary" content="3.5 stars., couldnt help but laugh .... it's enjoyable"></head><body><p>George Romaro returns to his core as the true zombie director, though he changes his style a little bit, his directoral skills are still apparent as he makes a very un-scary but fun bloodfest, I got a kick out of John Leguizamo being one of the stars and watching him be in something thats not unrelentlessly serious (Romeo & Juilet, Summer Of Sam & Moulin Rouge), Romaro still writes some pretty cool dialouge as well as shows that he has a few fun ideas up his sleeves after all, I wouldnt say I was impressed just because it is by far the  worst installment of Zombie series that he has created (which is really not saying alot).<br /><br />For Some reason I cant stop looking at "Land Of The Dead" as some what of a parody of the films that he has created before. I have to admitt that one of my favorite parts of his zombie movies overall is that the humans have to outsmart the zombies, not beat them through brute strength, so of course I really dont like that in this film the zombies's had reasoning power and even somewhat of a brain. oh well this film is good for a laugh or two and I would recommend it to Romaro fans even though the film is very different from his others, not to shabby<br /><br />Grade: C</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Visually dazzling movie remains true to story"></head><body><p>Mike Newell ("4 Weddings and a Funeral," "Love Actually") may have been an unexpected choice to direct Harry Potter film.  He's mastered the art of the British upper-crust romantic comedy, but anxious fans wondered how that would translate to Hogwarts, dragons, and the return of Lord Voldemort?<br /><br />Fortunately for all, Newell was up to the challenge and has given us one of the most visually stunning movies this side of Peter Jackson.<br /><br />You may have heard a slight rumor or the occasional hint that this movie does not treat J.K. Rowling's mammoth book as a shooting script.  This is true, and this was obviously the correct decision -- not even the most die-hard fan would sit still for the eight-hour movie that would have entailed.  It's not surprising to find fans frustrated with this movie because their favorite scenes (whether the dragon fight, or the big dance, or Harry's sojourn underwater, or Hagrid's romantic efforts) handled with a bit more economy than the book.<br /><br />But if you look at the movie for what it is, then you have to give it a rave review.  From the Triwizard Tournament to Harry's fight with the dragon to Lord Voldemort's bilious return, this movie looks great and captures the essence of J.K. Rowling's wonderful story.  I'll leave it to others to summarize the plot, but suffice to say that Harry, Ron and Hermione have grown, as have their dangers and concerns.  This is easily the most grown-up movie so far, and be warned if you have younger kiddies who may have liked the first couple of movies.  Dark stuff lies ahead.<br /><br />One scene stands out as one of the best extended special effects shots ever -- Harry's extended fight with the dragon is sure to turn up annually in those special effects montages that they fire off in the Academy Awards show just when everyone is getting ready to doze off.  Kudos all around!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Damn it, Jean Luc..."></head><body><p>Naw, it doesn't really have the same ring as 'Damn it, Jim...' does it? However, this is still the only Next Gen movie that comes even close to the genius of The Wrath Of Khan, The Voyage Home and Undiscovered Country.<br /><br />First Contact is the Next Gen crew at their very best, and this intelligently scripted movie excels at all levels. There are also so many excellent performances in here, including a stunning Alice Krige as The Borg Queen, that this movie will keep the average fan on the edge of her/his seat.<br /><br />Yet it is not all intensity, and Marina Sirtis turns in a hilarious and quite frankly, very sexy performance as a tipsy Deanna Troi. It is the increased warmth between the crew members that stirs echoes of the Classic Trek crew, and had the Next Gen movies been able to duplicate the high standard set by First Contact, they would have won over a lot more fans. Sadly, Insurrection and Nemesis never delivered on the promise of this genuine classic.<br /><br />Will they make another movie to repair the lost credibility over Nemesis? I don't know. After all, I'm just a reviewer Jim, not a miracle worker.<br /><br />Definitely an important purchase. Damn it.</p></body></html>

THis movie is so indulgent, so cruel, sos tasteless, that in the middle of it you simply don't care about the fate of that mess of a character interpreted by Guy Pearce. I idsliked this movie from beggining to end. No, I had absolutely none difficult to follow the falshbacks all the time, that's not the point. The point is that the history is awful, bad tasted, ridiculous, a disgrace to motion picture. But director and cast can rest assured they made something &quot;unique&quot; in thtehistory of the movies: one of the worst wastes of time ever !</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Top to Bottom a Great Movie!"></head><body><p>Just like the title of this post says, I found this movie, top to bottom to be a great film. It was compelling, interesting as hell and the acting, directing and cinematography were just 100%. I found myself glued to the screen. I was entertained and I was informed about the subject and I never found myself bored or even for a moment not wanting to watch more.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anybody who has knowledge of the subject or who likes true crime stories. But this movie is also for any adult who likes good cinema. Fincher is one of the best and one of my favorites.</p></body></html>

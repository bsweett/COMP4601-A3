<meta name="summary" content="Best movie ever?, No, but still pretty good"></head><body><p>I've seen some of those Hong Kong/Taiwan action movies (bits of them anyway) and generally have not been impressed. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was made in homage to them and does so with class. I thought that it was much better than most of those films and might even be better than most of the so called realistic movies done in this country. I found very little to complain about. The wire act bits were usually very well done, a few scenes did have a little too much bounce in the movements, I thought they were amazing. The plot mostly made sense to me although Zhang Ziyi's flashback segment seemed oddly placed (maybe I was tired when I saw it)but good otherwise. The end scene where Jen (Zhang Ziyi) jumps from the bridge was the low point in the movie for me, was that supposed to be a suicide or what?</p></body></html>

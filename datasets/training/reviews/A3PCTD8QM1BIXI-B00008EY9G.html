The film reminded of Lifeboat but with a scarier atompshere. The film in my opinion really didn't have any jump out of your seat moments. John Cuscack and Ray Lioltta are in top form as always and Amanda Peet looks yummy as always. My only other compliant with the film was that Jake Busey had such a small part. Still it's James Mangold best film since Copland and worth a look.</p></body></html>

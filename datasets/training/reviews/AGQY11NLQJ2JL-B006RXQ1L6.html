"Chicago" is an exception to that pointless wave of musicals and the story is a great one on stage or on the screen.<br /><br />What makes the movie very special is that it highlights all the characters and doesn't take the light away from the leads: Roxan, Velma, and the attorney.<br /><br />Certainly, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere shine together but great direction by Rob Marshall enhances a perfect plot and makes every character a star including the deceived husband, prison mates and even Velma who's annoyingly played by the equally annoying Zeta-Jones.</p></body></html>

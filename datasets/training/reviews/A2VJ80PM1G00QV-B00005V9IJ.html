<meta name="summary" content="Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks in a Nice Film"></head><body><p>I don't belittle the film by saying it is nice. It is a nice, a good, nice, film as few can make better than the talented Tom Hanks, Now, I am not saying that Tom Hanks is personally a nice guy, I don't know him. I am saying that as John Wayne, with a big assist from John Ford, created John Wayne who played John Wayne roles superbly, so Tom Hanks has created Tom Hanks, the character who can play a variety of nice guys in diverse situations.The film has been described in detail so I am left with, happily, simply the task of voicing my opinion that one comes away from the film knowing that a star has, with the help of Helen Hunt with not much to do but doing that very well, wrought his spell once more and left me, at any rate, with a good feeling as I got up out of my chair to take the DVD out of the machine and put it into its case to contribute to our resident's library with the assurance that other old timers will get the same pleasure out of it as I did.</p></body></html>

First, it is almost an exact interpretation of the book - right down to the little detail of the way Spade is amused at his own hand shaking after confronting Gutman.  Second - the performances.  Bogart immortalized two of the 20th century's greatest detectives - Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade.  Peter Lorre is unforgetable as Cairo and there is the inimitable Sydney Greenstreet as Gutman.  True, I didn't picture Brigid O'Shaugnessy as Mary Astor, but that's a trifle here.  This is a gem of cinema that allows us to travel to a time, place, and STYLE that doesn't exist anymore.</p></body></html>

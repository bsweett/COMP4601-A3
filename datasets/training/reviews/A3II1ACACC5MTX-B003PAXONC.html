If you have read the book, you had better leave it at the door. You will prefer this if you pretend the book didn't exist and view the film as a stand alone.<br /><br />Personally, the film could have done with the books sexy lap-dancing vampires gyrating wildly on the front lawn whilst Neville glumly contemplates a box of tissues and a 3-year old copy of "Readers Wives".<br /><br />OK, The Fresh Prince is besieged by his not so fresh subjects (hoho) in a Heston-esque manner by 28 Days Later mega zombies. I prefer the old lurchy ones, you know where you are with those. Anyway, the first half of the film (see Independence Day, War of the Worlds etc etc) is good, we get an insight into the deserted New York and some rather silly fooling about with tailors dummies in scenes probably pinched from The Quiet Earth (Kiwi Low budget sci-fi film.)<br /><br />There appears to be some sort of mega-king zombie who is intelligent and plans a trap for the incredibly stupid Smith to fall into, but we are never told the motivation for this. Why did the zombie do it? All of these shenanigans fall by the wayside quicker than a sunbathing vampire when the love interest arrives. The wheels fall off the film, which lurches to a less dignified end than an old fashioned zombie with no underpants on.  Which is a shame because this film could have been pretty good. Now if you make "War of the Independence Day Legend", you would get 3/4 of a great film, Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood, you really have to work harder at those endings. Now, I'm off to review Waterworld.</p></body></html>

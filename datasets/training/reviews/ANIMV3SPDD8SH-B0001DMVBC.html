<meta name="summary" content="HOUSE OF DREAD"></head><body><p>Dependent on the unlikely actions of several characters, &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; is a heavy-handed, utterly earnest excersize in contemporary tragedy. I understand that Jennifer Connely's character is supposed to be an average American whose life history remains obscure but her reason for being involved in a legal dispute over the ownership of a modest home is so unlikely it is rendered shallow. The cop who befriends Connely and slowly becomes psychotic due to a racist mentality is only a device to turn the lame story toward it's melodramatic resolution. It's certainly a watchable movie, even involving, Connely and Ben Kingsly as the compatriot in this legal dispute are excellent, but the platform plot too often sinks in the sand and gets lost in the fog.</p></body></html>

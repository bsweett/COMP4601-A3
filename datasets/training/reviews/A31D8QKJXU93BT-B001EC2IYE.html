But he's disguised  it as sports formula about a rags-to-riches boxer. That the boxer is a woman (Hilary Swank) is not the twist we just knew he would give the genre. The training and boxing scenes that introduce the characters and story lead us to expect "Rocky Redux." Eastwood gives us something else entirely, a one-two punch that makes it quite clear that the non-training, non-boxing scenes address the real plot and theme. You won't see it coming, but you'll sure know what hit you.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" has too good a script to rely on mere surprises, although the movie still moves us knowing them in advance. It's unfortunate, however, that some reviewers here have revealed them, as audiences and the national press have not. No matter on what side of its central controversy you stand, this movie sneaks up on you long after it's over, forcing you to delay discussing it until others have seen it. Even at the 2004 Academy Awards, Eastwood, Swank and Morgan Freeman (they each picked up one) kept its secrets.<br /><br />"Unforgiven," "Bird," "Mystic River," "Million Dollar Baby," his quirky comedies and taut thrillers, plus the many Oscars three of them have won, all qualify Eastwood as that rare Hollywood denizen, an auteur (he often composes his own musical scores.) And unlike some actors, he knows how to direct himself, a tricky feat. Only one dud apparent, "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," oddly disappointing given its bestsellerdom and starry cast (Kevin Spacey, Jude Law, his own daughter.) No split decision here, though. It's hard to avoid a tired boxing cliche when touting Clint's achievement, but "Million Dollar Baby" is a knockout.</p></body></html>

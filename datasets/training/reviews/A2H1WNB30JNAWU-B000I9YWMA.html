<meta name="summary" content="Very good Deep movie"></head><body><p>From Hell was a very good Deep movie and Graham did a great supporting role helping Deep out with the case of the Ripper.  The movie itself was good also in the fact that you felt as if you were there in that time period with the buildings and clothing so forth.  If you like your history and a good very good horror movie with lots of drama elements thrown into the mix then pick this movie up for some good acting and a good horror movie.</p></body></html>

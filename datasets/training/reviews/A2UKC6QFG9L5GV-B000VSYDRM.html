<meta name="summary" content="A MOVIE THAT STINKS (LITERALLY)"></head><body><p>Everyone who read Patrick Suskind's "Das Parfum" must remember how well-scented and at the same time fetid it was. Every page of the novel effuses some smell and it literally makes you either savor it or hold your nose in disgust. Suskind's talent in describing different kinds of flavour can't be overestimated, like a real poet he finds words and metaphors that sometimes let you salivate and sometimes bring you very close to throwing up. In my opinion the main challenge of this film from the very beginning of its creation was: will this movie smell like the book does?<br /><br />Many great directors were to make "Perfume..." and many washed their hands for a variety of reasons. Martin Scorsese, Milos Forman, Tim Burton and others - all of them were once attached to the project and walked away. Stanley Kubrick nurtured the idea of filming Suskind's novel for a long time but finally concluded "Das Parfum" was UNFILMABLE. And I can understand that - the book based on all kinds of odours is very hard to be put on celluloid. So walking to the theater I was recalling the book's first scene taking place at Paris' fish market couple of centuries back and thinking - will it all smell?<br /><br />And - oh, my God - it did! It smelled and it reeked right from the screen. Certainly the book smelled better (or worse in this case) but those things you do not see but only imagine always hit harder, so I doubt any movie can be better than a book. But in this case actually it wasn't this film's idea - to top the novel, it just had to match it distantly. And it matched indeed. "Perfume..." is no cheap adaptation of another book - it's a piece of art of its own and it deserves some recognition. Tom Tykwer - a young German director whose best-known work to date was "Run, Lola, Run" seemed rather strange candidate to direct this picture at the first glance, but ultimately it turned out to be a wise idea. Tykwer is not afraid to experiment and we've seen it in "Lola". Many of his patterns and tricks from that movie were later used by a number of directors around the world. He is innovative and that's a fact. If you close your eyes and try hard to imagine what Martin Scorsese, Milos Forman or Tim Burton would do with this picture, I bet you'll come up with some idea and I bet it will be right. But what could we expect from Tom Tykwer? Only some surprise.<br /><br />Finally there were no surprise and in "Perfume..." Tykwer didn't invent anything. It was pretty traditional I'd say, but still very professional, magnificent and exciting. Still better than I think any other director would manage it. And what's most important - it SMELLED. It had all the scents and fragrances needed to feel yourself inside this movie. Tykwer didn't do the impossible, but he was very close... And in this case it's a hell of an achievement.<br /><br />Actors deserve a whole separate article, I'll only say Ben Whishaw and everyone else except Dustin Hoffman were awesome and the latter is still playing the role of Bernie Focker as it seems with all my respect :) Although I like THAT role of his a lot I think here he could be a little more serious. On the other hand - don't pay attention to my lamentations - a comic part was never too bad for any movie. So maybe it's just me. Anyway - why 4 stars? 5 would go for the impossible done by the director, but unfortunately I'm positive it was impossible to do so (no pun intended). Hence 4 is the highest rating this picture can get in my opinion and I'm giving it the highest rating possible.</p></body></html>

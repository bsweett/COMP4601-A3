<meta name="summary" content="Character Study of a Successful Arms Dealer."></head><body><p>`Lord of War', written and directed by Andrew Niccol, starring (and co-produced by) Nicolas Cage is a slightly better than average Nicholas Cage vehicle which at least some reviewers represented among the blurbs on the cover seem to misuderstand. At least two blurbs describe the film as a `thriller', but it is definitely not a `thriller' in any normal sense of the term. My best description of the nature of the movie may be a `biopic' based on a parody of a `New Yorker' profile of a fictional arms dealer.<br /><br />The movie is much more about motives, personality, and development of the Cage character, a Ukranian emigrant to `little Odessa' in Brooklyn who develops his `shady' to illegal arms trade from selling Uzi's to mercenaries to selling tanks and attack helicopters to African insurgents and strong men. The flick is not a thriller because aside from a few short incidents, there is never any enduring threat to the principle characters or any great mystery about Cage's character or his enterprises. By comparison, the great thriller, `The Usual Suspects' creates a big puzzle from the very beginning which grows with developments until it is resolved only in the very last scene. Nothing like that is going on here. There is even very little mystery or suspense over whether Cage's character will succeed with his romantic campaign.<br /><br />This movie is all about the principle character's morality, the morality, or more accurately the strong legal sense of his antagonist, the Interpol agent played by Ethan Hawke, and the advice the principle gets from veteran arms dealer played by Ian Holm, and the consequences of following Holm's advice.<br /><br />This movie is not quite as engaging as Cages's best flicks, such as `Adaptation', `Matchstick Man', or even the action movie `Con Air'. But, it is a whole lot better than some of Cage's stinkers such as `War Birds'.<br /><br />Actully, one of the most interesting things about the movie is what we learn about the illegal weapons trade and how it was affected by the end of the cold war. One almost expects these types of characters to be either outright scoundrels or inept. Cage is neither. He succeeds in escaping from the dual perils of the law and his unsavory customers.<br /><br />Unlike `Con Air' and even `Adaptation', this movie suffers a bit from the rather light cast. There is no one like  John Malkovich against which he can play.<br /><br />All in all, this is still a worthwhile movie, although the DVD extras are remarkably slim, probably because there is another 2 disk version, of course, for a higher price!</p></body></html>

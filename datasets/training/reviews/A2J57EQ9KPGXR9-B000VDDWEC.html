<meta name="summary" content="Not that scary, but it does work as a drama."></head><body><p>As a horror film, &quot;28 Days Later&quot; is only so-so. Its not that scary, the &quot;zombies&quot; do alot of chasing but no flesh eating; there made for TV movies that are scarier than this film. However, there are some genuinely tense moments in this movie and the acting and general plotline are very good. <p>Don't buy into the &quot;alternate ending&quot; hype, its not worth getting the DVD just for that.</p></body></html>

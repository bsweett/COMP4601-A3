<meta name="summary" content="If You Liked 'T2,' You Should Like This"></head><body><p>If you watched the first two movies in this "series," particularly the second film, then most of this should be very familiar territory. You can expect to see more of the same, meaning:<br /><br />1 - Some spectacular action scenes; 2 - more action than is needed; 3 - A supposedly-unstoppable villain robot (this time a female); 3 - profane and somewhat annoying lead characters, except for Arnold, of course; 4 - seeing some naked butts (odd knowing one is the governor of Califronia); 5 - humor mixed in with all the violence; 6 - great overall special-effects and surround sound.<br /><br />The first 30 minutes of this movie was the best part, I thought. Overall, there was so much action it wore me out but it was a worthy sequel to the last movie. If you enjoyed watching what the "bad cyborg" Robert Patrick could do in the "Terminator 2," you'll really be entertained by his successor, played by Kristannia Loken. Like Patrick, she doesn't say much....but doesn't have to. Schwarzenegger, meanwhile, performs admirably in his last starring role (I think) before tackling bigger responsibilities in real life.</p></body></html>

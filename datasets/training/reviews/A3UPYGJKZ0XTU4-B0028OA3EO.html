<meta name="summary" content="Reasonably Entertaining but Weak."></head><body><p>"Superman Returns" picks up the cinematic tradition of Superman after "Superman: The Movie" (1978) and "Superman II" (1980), ignoring the ill-conceived, campy Superman III & IV movies. We have a new Superman (Brandon Routh), who abandoned his love affair with Lois Lane and his adopted planet to search for his history in the ruins of Krypton. Returning after a 5-year absence, he resumes his reporting  job at Metropolis' "Daily Planet", disguised as mild-mannered Clark Kent. Still pining for star reporter Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), Clark finds that she has taken up with the boss' nephew Richard White (James Marsden), with whom she has a young son. Lex Luther (Kevin Spacey), however, has not abandoned his old ways. Out of prison once again, he plans to become the ultimate real estate mogul by replacing North America with his own brand new continent, aided by crystals he has stolen from Superman's Fortress of Solitude.<br /><br />I think fans will rank "Superman Returns" lower than Superman I & II but higher than the other sequels. The story is fine. Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey, as Lex Luther and his bubble-headed mistress, are sufficiently heavyweight thespians to inject some laughs into the adventure without undermining it. Brandon Routh makes a beautiful superhero, and I think that returning to a young image was probably smart. This is an entertaining movie with a few conspicuous flaws: The action sequences are the least satisfying aspect of the film. They seem compulsory and flat. Lois Lane is bland. She doesn't have enough personality to keep our interest, much less Superman's. Kate Bosworth is clearly too young for the role -though I suspect that is to avoid having Lois look older than the new, youthful Superman. And, at 2 hours 34 minutes, this movie is too long. More interesting action and a more forceful Lois Lane would have saved "Superman Returns" from mediocrity. As it is, a marginal 3 ? stars.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner 2006 single disc): No bonus features. Subtitles are available in English, French, and Spanish. Dubbing is available in Spanish.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Will Smith in one of his best films...."></head><body><p>Now we've all seen this plotline before, Robots created by humans start killing mankind to take over the world. However don't let that scare you away from this great movie. All the characters show how they each shine in this sci-fi thriller.<br /><br />Will Smith stars as Del Spooner, a cop that seems to think that the robots made for humans to help with labor will somehow turn on mankind and start thinking for themselves. The only problem he has is that everyone thinks he is just being paranoid, which just proves he will be right as the movie continues.<br /><br />When a roboticist, a guy that designs the robots, is found killed after being tossed outside the ledge of a huge building, that is all it takes for Spooner to believe the, "Rise of the Machines" will happen. The robot being questioned denies any involvment with the doctor's death, even though he was found at the scene of the crime.<br /><br />Its not long before more robots start turning bad, you can tell right before they are by the red lights that flash on inside them. Spooner just somehow always seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, as he fends off at least a few dozen at a time when they attack, once in a freeway tunnel in a thrilling car chase that involves two trucks that have sliding doors and at least 40 robots.<br /><br />While the acting may not be the greatest, I found that the robot, Sunny, was really good at trying to express human emotion as all he wants to do is be free and live in a quiet life. Will is good most of the time, as the tough cop who is the one that really knows what is going on as eveyone else thinks he is just stupid at times.<br /><br />And it was the visual effects that made this worth it. The robots are great, as more and more start making an army of renegade robots. As Spooner and his partner, Susan Calvin [played by Bridget Moynahan] are on top of a huge building, trying to shut down the robots, I found it quite dizzying from seeing it at a birds eye view.<br /><br />Another great scene is when the robots manage to get inside the police station in the city, and the lieutenant who is always on Spooner's back fends them off with a shotgun. Great action, sounds, and vivid color all add to the suspense.<br /><br />The big twist on who the real bad guy is in the movie is surprising [At least I thought it was] and if you are the type who likes to just watch the movie instead of trying to figure out the ending then this is great fun. I definately reccomend this movie.</p></body></html>

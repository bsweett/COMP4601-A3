<meta name="summary" content="30's sci fi recreated"></head><body><p>Such a strange film: it is very like John W. Campbell type 30's sci fi<br />novel brought to life:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1434401049">Invaders from the Infinite</a><br />Saving the world in a nick of time from an German evil genius who<br />predates the Nazis, Sky Captain is the 30's flying ace personified.<br />I think that the robots and flapping winged airplanes are<br />very well done. The Rocket ship is classic 30's design as well.<br />in a way it is an alternate history or an almost comic classic revival.<br />It is 30's sci fi as it deserved to be filmed, not as it<br />was filmed.</p></body></html>

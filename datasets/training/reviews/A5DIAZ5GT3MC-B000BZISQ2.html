<meta name="summary" content="&quot;T3 DVD&quot; Review"></head><body><p>My first opinion of Jonathan Mostow's &quot;Terminator 3&quot; was one of anger. The ending of the movie bothered me. To be honest, it still bothers me. The &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise had always been one of my favorites and I just didn't care for much of this movie. Having had a chance to watch it again on DVD, I will give credit where its due. Mostow did a compendable job with a great deal of things. The atmosphere of the movie still feels like a &quot;Terminator&quot; film. Most series lose that feeling by the third entry. Add in the fact that it's been close to twelve years since the last one and that's pretty impressive. My biggest problem with &quot;T3&quot; is that it never manages to do anything more than follow the same direction as &quot;Terminator 2&quot;. Despite the fact that it uses more elaborate effects shots, it still never captures the epic feeling of its predacessor. On the DVD's commentray track, Mostow makes mention of the fact that he takes the film's villian (Kristanna Loken) out of the movie for a lengthy period of time but forgets that Cameron did the very same thing in &quot;T2&quot; with Robert Patrick. Still, if you're just looking for a big, loud action movie that will blow the hell out of your speakers, this is worth a try. While it is miles behind the previous two films in innovation and style, the third &quot;Terminator&quot; is at least good for some by-the-numbers thrills. The movie both looks and sounds amazing. As a stand-alone film, it works but as a fan of the series, it hardly lived up to my expectations. It was good to see Arnold back in action though. The double-disc DVD has a humorous deleted scene and some other featurettes but don't be surprised if Warner Bros. ends up making an even better edition in the not too distant future.</p></body></html>

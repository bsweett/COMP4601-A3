<meta name="summary" content="Well presented and peformed...but lacking in outrage."></head><body><p>When I first heard about this movie, I remember wondering how the absolutely horrific events that occurred in Rwanda could be captured in a PG-13 movie, and still stir the outrage they should.  After seeing HOTEL RWANDA, I know they can't.<br /><br />I remember years ago getting my Newsweek delivered and finding inside some of the most disturbing photographic images I've ever seen.  Reading the statistics in the accompanying story simply added to the horror.  How could our modern society, with its instant communications, color TV, and so forth have let this bloodbath go on?  Hundreds of thousands of people murdered in the most horrific ways.  And yet, it seldom even made front-page news.<br /><br />HOTEL RWANDA is a handsomely made film, and it is VERY well acted.  Don Cheadle is particularly fine in the role that finally got him some  attention at awards time.  He is so underrated, because he's so effortless.  We're rarely aware of him acting.  Sophie Okonedo, as his wife, is radiant. I sure hope to see her in more movies in the near future.  The story of this man and wife (he is in a management position at a luxury hotel in Rwanda and finds himself not only taking in refugees who are doomed to be killed otherwise, but risking his own life to save them) is riveting as far as it goes.  We absolutely admire the risks they all took...Cheadle in particular shows great amounts of courage shining through knee-quaking fear.  He's the most reluctant of heroes...he's almost saving the lives of his refugees because that's what you do for your guests.  I don't mean to downplay his achievements...I'm simply saying that his courage is almost casual...as though no sane person would make another choice but to be brave.  But you can tell underneath that he's terrified.<br /><br />But the outrages that took place in Rwanda still demand more attention.  The film tries to show how the outside world abandoned Rwanda in its time of extreme crisis and chaos.  But so much brutality is missing.  Am I looking for gratuitous violence...no.  But I would like to see the public shocked out of its complacency.  Remember how SCHINDLER'S LIST got people talking about the holocaust as no other movie ever had.  Or how SAVING PRIVATE RYAN made clear the path for THE GREATEST GENERATION and fundraising for the long-overdue WWII Memorial?  This was in great part because Spielberg set out to slap us in the face with a visceral reminder of that the people who lived those events went through (and the people who didn't survive).  Both of those films left me silent, amazed and beyond tears.  HOTEL RWANDA should have done the same.  Certainly the atrocities committed were of a caliber to rival events that occurred in Europe in WWII or in the USSR during Stalin's reign.<br /><br />So, I guess I watched the movie with the wrong expectations.  I found the story fascinating and engaging.  The scene where the couple agree that they will commit suicide with their children if the rebels come (and later, when Cheadle thinks they may have mistakenly carried out their pact) will put a lump in your throat, and move you to the edge of your seat.  Another scene where Cheadle and a companion are forced to drive their truck of supplies over piles of bodies begins to suggest what this movie could have been on a visceral level.  My intellect was stimulated, my heart was moved, but my gut stayed uninvolved.<br /><br />By all means, see this fine movie.  But don't let it fool you into thinking what happened in Rwanda is being captured in the film.<br /><br />I seldom comment on the bonus materials, but in the case, I would say that the DVD offered a perfect opportunity for a "history lesson" documentary about Rwanda's recent political history...just who are the Hutu and the Tutsi's?  But it's not there.</p></body></html>

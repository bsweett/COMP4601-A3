<meta name="summary" content="Willis is still Willis"></head><body><p>After all, don't we watch the Die Hard movies for Willis' laconic, ironic, iconic and insouciant style?  Sure, the plot is a shotgun marriage of "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" and "Enemy of the State" but it doesn't really matter because Willis is there taking on the bad guys, giving us his deadpan, his sneers, his wisecracks, and great action as he once again saves the day.  New York, L.A. and New Jersey are lucky to have him as a cop!</p></body></html>

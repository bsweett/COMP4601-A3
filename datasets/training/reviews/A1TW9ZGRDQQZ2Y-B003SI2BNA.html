<meta name="summary" content="Good Performances Make Up For a Lacking Script"></head><body><p>If it were not for good performances from Jennifer Connelly, John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, and the guy who played the foreign janitor, this movie would have been lacking the key element that makes this film work. The story is basically the same as The Ring (water is used immensely, little girl killed, etc.) and really doesn't provide any true scares. I liked the atmosphere of the old apartment complex and the darkness of the picture, but this is one to rent on DVD and enjoy for a bit cheaper than a movie ticket price. I enjoyed the acting for sure, but sadly the story holds no water.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's hard to think of anything new to say about this film..."></head><body><p>It's truly difficult to come up with anything original to say about Citizen Kane, as it is one of the films that has been endlessly discussed, dissected, and reviewed over the years. To get to the point, though, there IS a reason for all this fuss. Admittedly, Citizen Kane may not be THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME because that title really doesn't have any meaning - there are so many types of films that to compare them ALL in one category is ridiculous. <p>Nevertheless, as stated earlier, there is a reason why Citizen Kane has been ranked as it has. Although it is easy to dismiss Citizen Kane as no longer being as groundbreaking as it once was, this is a silly way to approach film. So what if it is no longer new technologically? Watched as objectively as possible, like any other film, Citizen Kane is very entertaining and has many obvious merits. For instance, the acting is top notch, as is the insightful, cynical script. Yes, the cinematography is good too. <p>Just in case there are people out there who aren't familiar with the plot of this film, it is a series of flashbacks on the life of Charles Foster Kane, a man who controlled numerous newspapers and a vast fortune. Many films dealing with tycoons have been made before and since Citizen Kane, but none have been able to deal with the topic as brilliantly as Orson Welles did in his remarkable debut. <p>Anyhow, it may be that Citizen Kane has aged some, and it is hard to identify ONE FILM as the greatest of all time. But after watching Citizen Kane with an open mind it becomes clear why people might rate it as such - from start to finish, this is a beautifully rendered, interesting, and amusing film. As far as unforgettable moments go, it's tough to beat ROSEBUD! So go see what the fuss is all about and enjoy two hours of classic entertainment!</p></body></html>

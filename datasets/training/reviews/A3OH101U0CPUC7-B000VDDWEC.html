The Horror!"></head><body><p>28 Days Later begins when some foolish environmental activists/terrorists manage to unleash a plague of "Rage" upon England (and possibly the world).  The story then picks up 28 days later when a young man wakes up from a coma in his hospital bed that goes back to just prior to the outbreak.  As he, and by extension we, attempt to find out what's going on he wanders around London calling out "hello" repeatedly with no one answering.  While he ultimately manages to find other people as well as some infected unfortunates, it is striking how empty the entire city of London is.  Where did all those millions of people disappear to?  We never learn the answer to that question.  As the movie continues and we see the rest of England, we find it is similarly depopulated.  There are nowhere near enough corpses to believe everyone is dead and nowhere near enough infected to believe that everyone has turned.<br /><br />I would gladly set aside an empty country if there were only something interesting happening in the movie to push it from my mind.  Sadly, the plot is almost nonexistent in this movie.  Very little actually happens.  Our small band of characters wander an empty UK and are very occasionally attacked but there is surprisingly little real menace.  When they finally find an organized band of military men, we find that man's inhumanity to man is alive and well as these "saviors" are arguably worse than the Rage infected maniacs.  This theme has been done in virtually every movie of this type since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Y6Y2">Night of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition)</a> and almost always in a far more interesting way.<br /><br />The director of this film clearly has no idea how to build suspense, develop characters, or even shoot interesting action scenes.  I can't say that any aspect of this film was strong, or even mediocre, and would urge any and all people who haven't seen this yet to avoid it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dark revenge tale explores the depths of hatred, revenge, and self-delusion"></head><body><p>"Oldboy" could have been a terrible, terrible movie, bordering on pornography.  The story is an unsettling tale of vengeance, murder, suicide, mutilation, sex, more mutilation, and incest.  The movie seems to focus on what human beings will do in the name of justice, and then twists darkly into an exploration of the ugly aspects of truth.<br /><br />The plot seems to be simple enough at the outset.  A drunken man is making a fool of himself at the police station, babbling incoherently about missing his daughter's birthday party.  Finally bailed out by his friend, the drunk is swiftly kidnapped off the street by forces unknown.<br /><br />And he is kept in prison for fifteen years.  15 years of one room, one TV, and a whole bunch of fried pot stickers.<br /><br />And then, he is freed.  He does not know why.  He does not know who did this to him.  He just knows that he must find seek vengeance.<br /><br />Virtuoso filmmaking elevates this story - one that has a pretty high body count but gets a lot more "mileage" out of its torture scenes (and there are quite a few) than the killings.  Indeed, the most disturbing death scene involves the live octopus famously consumed at dinner.  This is movie where several body parts are sliced off, penetrated, or pried out of their natural locations, and "Oldboy" shows none of Quentin Tarantino's restraint - remember when Mr. Blonde cuts off the cop's ear off-screen in "Reservoir Dogs"?  Very little happens off-screen in "Oldboy."<br /><br />"Oldboy" is one of those dark, ultraviolent films that has a lot to say and doesn't really leave you feeling all that good at the end.  But like other ultraviolent films like "A Clockwork Orange," or "Menace 2 Society," or even (in its own way) "Natural Born Killers,"  that uses its extreme violence and subject matter in an intelligent, entertaining way.  Just be warned - this is far from the feel-good movie of the year.  But if you can stomach it, it's a pretty darn good flick.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An animated film as real as it can get."></head><body><p>I have never reviewed a Pixar film on Amazon just yet, but their 10th feature `Up' had to be. Pixar, since Toy Story has spit out one hit after another bringing a whole new generation of legendary Disney Characters. While every single one of them has been incredible `Up' just stands out because it is unlike any of its Pixar predecessors.<br /><br />This is the second film from Pixar to be given a PG rating since The Incredibles. While The Incredibles was more based around comic books and superhero action the first few minutes of Up are very adult oriented. There are extremely real elements that lead us to the main characters adventure, but the previous one he had was real life. It is a beautiful sequence with no dialogue, but a score to show a husband and wife sharing the happy times and the devastating ones, one of them being the loss of a loved one. Even with no words it is so heartfelt and full of emotion it is just something that a young audience might not understand and the scene where Carl assaults a construction worker is also a moment that is very hard to explain to a very young person. After that the story changes gears to a rip roaring hysterical adventure. The cast works so well together especially bringing two legends in Edward Asner and Christopher Plumber. Everyone will love Russell, the eager young explorer who seeks adventure, but there is also more depth to this character that again reflects real live issues such as parent separation. Of course there is pure Disney magic in this film especially in the animals. This time when there are talking dogs, `Up' uses technology to make them speak instead of a traditional imaginative talking animal. That was a stroke of genius making is actually believable that someone can create a device to make an animal speak and still keep its own natural characteristics.<br /><br />Up may be the best Pixar film to date although I love each and every one of them, this just stands out as a story that was trying to get as real as it could. I do feel that if someone tied that many balloons to a house it could fly. So find a way to see this film it will truly lift your spirits and melt your heart. Oh, if you start yelling `Squirrel' at the top of your lungs no one will think you're out of your mind.</p></body></html>

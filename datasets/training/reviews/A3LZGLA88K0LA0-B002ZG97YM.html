<meta name="summary" content="FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN"></head><body><p>Beautifully filmed and using good actors for voice performances, HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON was a big box office draw in 2010.  It has eye-popping visuals and lots of high-powered action sequences to frame it's all too familiar tale of a young Viking lad who befriends an injured dragon and achieves his manhood.<br />I enjoyed most of the film, but there's nothing new here and even kids minds may wander.  Certainly it's a well-done if routine film.</p></body></html>

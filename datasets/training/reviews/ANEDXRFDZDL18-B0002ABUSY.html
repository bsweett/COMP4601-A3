<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Entertaining if you like Zombie films"></head><body><p>Dawn of the dead stars a nurse whose boyfriend comes down with a strange disease which turns him into a flesh-eating zombie. Things get worse as she realizes the entire city is infected. Teaming up with a gang of misfits and a terse police officer, the group hide in a mall, until tempers flare.<br /><br />Ultimately, the group decides to try to make a 'run for it' for a nearby boatyard. Can the group make it in time?<br /><br />I enjoyed the team dynamics of this film. I thought there was some great acting and the special effects were overall were great. The plot is basically 'us against them' with an added dash of a timelock. My only disappointment? I really wanted to know what happened in the end!<br /><br />Great, fast moving, gory fun.</p></body></html>

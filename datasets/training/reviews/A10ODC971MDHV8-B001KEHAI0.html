<meta name="summary" content="Groundhog Day"></head><body><p>Harold Ramis's oddball comedy tracks a cynical meteorologist's hilarious efforts to free himself from a wormhole that's locked him into one of the dreariest days of his entire life. Murray's deadpan line reading and impeccable comic timing are what really make this such a cult favorite--especially as he devises various schemes to escape the temporal loop (including suicide!), and then decides to take a more productive tack. Chris Elliott, playing a dodo-brained camera operator, and sultry brunette MacDowell, the charming, cool-headed love interest, are wonderful as well. This is a fun, heady riff on petty misery that's tailor-made for Murray fans. Plus, you'll never hear Sonny and Cher's "I Got You, Babe" quite the same way again.</p></body></html>

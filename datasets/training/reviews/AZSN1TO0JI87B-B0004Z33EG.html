Directed by Ted Kotcheff ("Weekend at Bernie's") and co-starring Brian Dennehy, Richard Crenna and a young David Caruso, the film is as notorious for its extensive action scenes as it is for the intense and iconic performance put forth by Stallone, who is also credited for writing the screenplay.<br /><br /> Ex-Green Beret and Vietnam War veteran John Rambo is passing through a small town after learning of the death of a member of his unit, and all he wants is something to eat. The local sheriff (Dennehy) doesn't take too kindly to him, however, and after he breaks out of jail, a strong disagreement turns into a full-scale war, with Rambo at odds against the town's police force. Not only does he make a fool of the sheriff, but in his wake, leaves a trail of destruction all on his own that only serves to match the amount of rage and alienation built up inside of him.<br /><br />Despite laying the violence on a bit thick, the film never cheapens or lowers itself to average action-filler. At the heart of it, it's a story about a man's mental disintegration following a failed attempt at re-entering society. Stallone's speech during his breakdown towards the end of the film not only shows significant range for the actor, but also marks a rare occurrence where an action film attempts to address a painful but all too true reality. "Rambo" is not only a great action film, but a gritty and raw one that feels real and human at the same time. Action films just don't get better than this, although the three sequels that followed sure did try.</p></body></html>

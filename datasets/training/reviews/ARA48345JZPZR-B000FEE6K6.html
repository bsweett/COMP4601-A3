<meta name="summary" content="Amorality anyone?"></head><body><p>This sharp, incisive, and darkly funny movie about the career of a Ukrainian born American gunrunner was probably too cynical to find acceptance with a general audience.  Its central character is an amoral, conscience-challenged arms dealer who finds it impossible to leave his chosen profession no matter the cost to himself or the people around him because "he's good at it".<br /><br />Despite all of Nicholas Cage's inherent charm, this guy is hard to like, especially as the progress of the film will demonstrate his gaining the world and losing his soul and everything else that matters to him.  Films with disturbing protaganists usually don't do well, and judging by a lot of the negative reviews I see here, I think this was a prime example of that response.<br /><br />Most Americans probably don't even recognize or contemplate the fact that our government is the largest arms dealer in the world.  Followed of course, as pointed out in the movie, by all the rest of the UN Security Council (China, France, Great Britain, Russia).<br /><br />You can take the stance that Nic Cage's Yuri does in the film of "if I don't do it someone else will" or you can wonder would any of the suffering of, especially, the third world be relieved if arms dealing wasn't so easy, prevalent, and cheap.  Yuri is not sociopathic as many have labeled him in their reviews, he is doggedly amoral.  He takes no sides, he deals to whoever has the cash.  His chief rival admonishes him that he must take sides.  But is that any real option or just more of the same rationale to assauge one's conscience?<br /><br />At any rate, I for one wasn't bored, and I found the writing sharp and insightful and fascinating as it recounts in dispassionate detail the rise of a world class arms dealer.  Extremely well played by Cage, he somehow remains detached from the consequences of his actions for a long while, until all the dark and cynical humor coalesces in the end to a detailing of the harsh tragedy the trade really engenders.<br /><br />The writer/director has created a stylish piece that actually bites into a subject worth thinking about, and takes us into a ruthless and cold world we know little about. Recommended for those wanting something different. 4-1/2 stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Romero's Original Gets All Polished Up"></head><body><p>With all of the remakes, reboots, and re-imaginings of classic (and some not-so-classic) horror films, I was a bit hesitant to watch Scott Kosar, Ray Wright, and Breck Eisner's version of George A. Romero's semi-classic "The Crazies."  Kosar and Wright updated the screenplay, moved it to a new location (Ogden Marsh, Iowa) and generally maintained the essence of the original film.  Director Eisner keeps the film interesting by mixing equal parts of suspense and action with brief quiet moments between the primary characters.<br /><br />The film starts at a baseball game in the heartland of America.  During the game, Sheriff Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) has a tense encounter with a local named Rory Hamill, who pulls a gun on Dutton and the sheriff is forced to shoot him.<br /><br />While at home with his pregnant wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell), Dutton considers the shooting death of Hamill.  Judy consoles him and he eventually goes to bed.  He's awakened early the next day by the fire department when they tell him another resident has set his own home on fire with his family in it.  More bizarre events begin to occur as the day wears on.  Some citizens begin to "zone out" while others begin to act out violently.<br /><br />After a bit of investigating, the sheriff demands that the towns water supply be shut off.  Then the military shows up and begins to lock down the entire area.  Citizens are divided into two classes:  those who show signs of the virus driving people insane and those who appear to be fine.  The townspeople turn on the military and each other, and soon it's every man for himself.  Dutton, his loyal deputy, Russell Clank (Joe Anderson), Judy, and her medical assistant, Becca (Danielle Panabaker), try to evade the military and the violent townsfolk in order to escape the chaos, but they soon find the odds stacked against them and their chances of survival quickly dwindle.<br /><br />While many people want to classify this film as a zombie flick, I have to say that the "villains" in this film are a much more lively, much more terrifying bunch.  The virus that affects the residents of Ogden Marsh makes them bloodthirsty and violent, but they manage to keep enough of their wits about them to become real threats to those who aren't affected.  The infected don't lumber around in mass groups.  Instead, they gang up and hunt those who haven't succumbed to the virus, often with revenge in mind.  Others continue to do their normal daily routines and hobbies, but with deadly consequences for those who get in their way.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about this film is that Dutton and Clank aren't portrayed as stereotypically dumb lawmen.  Instead, they almost immediately realize what the cause is for their neighbors and friends' bizarre behavior and attempt to save as many people as they can before the military quarantines the area.<br /><br />Olyphant and Anderson shine as the lawmen in this film.  Mitchell is sufficient, as is Panabaker in a somewhat small role.  Supporting players such as Larry Cedar as the Principal Sandborn and Christie Lynn Smith as Deardra Farnum give solid, albeit brief, performances.<br /><br />When you boil down to it, "The Crazies" is just one more "infection" flick along the lines of "28 Days Later."  However, it stands above most of the other films in this genre due to smart characters, above average acting, solid direction, and a decent script.  Recommended to fans of modern thrillers and anyone who's tired of generic zombie fodder.</p></body></html>

For one, the set designs are brilliant, the lighting and mood of just about every scene is fantastic and the musical numbers, while all actual recordings, are choreographed in such a way that you could swear Foxx did all his own singing.  Case in point, there is a scene where Ray is singing in a club and in the recording some of the first words out of his mouth are mumbled and so to make it authentic Jamie knocks the microphone off balance for a moment.  It's the little touches like that one that make this movie authentic, accurate and worth while.<br /><br />I did enjoy Foxx, so don't get me wrong, but I did feel that his work in `Collateral' was more deserving of the praise.  The main problem I have with Foxx's performance is that he invests so much time and energy into getting Ray down that he forgets to infuse enough of himself into the performance to make Jamie the actor stand out aside from Ray the character.  But, with that little jab of criticism I will admit that he's a force on screen and demands you pay attention.<br /><br />That said, to me the real star of this film is the man behind the camera, Taylor Hackford.  His acute eye for detail is fantastic here, and is a huge step up from his previous work.  Technically `Ray' is far from my favorite biopic, even in the year of the biopic it falls short of perfection and or utter brilliance, but when `Ray' hits its mark it hits it with such beautiful depth and clarity that it makes up for its minor shortcomings.  Did it deserve a `Best Picture' Oscar nomination?  Not really, but I'm not going to whine about that too much.<br /><br />Another aspect of the film that shines like a diamond among pearls is the impressive female supporting cast, all of which deserved any and all recognition and praise for they all were essential in not only developing the man that was Ray into a full blown character study but they were also pertinent in making `Ray' the film a film entertaining and relatable from beginning to end.  Kerry Washington, an actress I've just fallen in love with over the years, gives such a brutally honest performance as Charles wife, the woman who stands by her man and supports him despite his addictions to drugs and loose women.  Regina King gives probably the most explosive performance of the bunch as Margie, one of Ray's backup singers and his obsessive secret lover.  Her brilliance on screen is matched only by her spunk and heart and it's a true pleasure to watch her chew each and every scene she encounters.  Sharon Warren also does a splendid job as Ray's mother and is sure to stand out as a remembered favorite.<br /><br />The life of Ray Charles was a hard one, full of deceit, drugs, women and pressure.  He was abused, taken advantage of and used and on the other side he abused, took advantage of and used others in the process, but the true story of Ray Charles is a story about overcoming our weaknesses and growing into the person we knew we had in us all along, the person who has been dying to come out but just needed to opportunity.  My one big disappointment with this film is that it never truly shows us the recovery Ray made.  We see his struggles, his problems and his faults.  We see him finally realize he needs help but we never see him truly change, we just read about it in a montage of newspaper clippings that litter the final frames of the film.  It's a small quaral I know, but it's one I'm not ready to let go of.  If the ending had only added as much depth as the beginning and middle had then maybe this would have been a more deserving film to me, but in the end, even with my issue included, `Ray' is still a wonderful biopic, one that I'm happy to have seen and will most definitely see again.</p></body></html>

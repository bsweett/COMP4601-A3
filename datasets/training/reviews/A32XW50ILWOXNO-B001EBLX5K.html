<meta name="summary" content="Slapstick and satire blended into a sweet-smelling brew"></head><body><p>Out of all the supposedly daring, controversial pictures released in 2006 - "The Da Vinci Code" and "V For Vendetta" being two prime examples - here is the movie event of the year, that one must-see picture.<br /><br />"Borat." Yes, "Borat."<br /><br />It is not the slickest comedy, and surely not the funniest, but its timely fusion of ingredients - satire, puns, visual gags, verbal gaffes, grossly-gross nudie stuff - make it irresistible and effective. Let's face it: It's the 10-car pileup on the Interstate. Our eyes are wide, our necks are wrenched and our mouths are slack in disbelief.<br /><br />Officially titled "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," the film stars comedian Sacha Baron Cohen as the title character, a wild-looking, anti-Semitic buffoon who plays up every stereotype Americans have about the Third World and Eastern Europe.<br /><br />Especially the anti-Semitism, which is revealed in an annual Kazak ritual so terrifically offensive (and creative) that writing about it won't do it justice. Several set pieces in "Borat" fall into that category. They work solely in the context of the character, not outside him. The best parts of the movie are the kind of satire you have to leave at the theater door.<br /><br />Doesn't mean you can't go back.<br /><br />So Borat is sent to New York City with his assistant (Ken Davitian) for cultural reports, and he finds a hostile city unwilling to receive his customary greeting of a kiss. His work there is unsuccessful. Then he sees Pamela Anderson on "Baywatch," finds out she lives in Malibu, Calif., and treks across the country in a used ice cream truck with his assistant. And a pet bear.<br /><br />He makes stops, mostly in the South, on his way to California. In scenes that Cohen and director Larry Charles insist are real, Borat appears on a morning show, sings at a rodeo and breaks up a Southern dining club by inviting an overweight black prostitute named Lunell.<br /><br />Some of "Borat" really is a crass reworking of "Candid Camera," as this fictional reporter, through innocent, Third World ignorance, forces his subjects to confront his skewed morality or cheerfully join him. A couple do, including some fraternity members in an RV. If there is one scene that feels forced in "Borat," it's this one. These guys seem to be cranking up their misogyny a few too many decibels.<br /><br />But one sequence is hilariously real, and that's a nude wrestling match between Cohen and Davitian, who is, well, a big man. The two are fighting WWE-style - except that it's no act - and I've never seen anything ? quite ? like ? it. It works on three levels: As a shock fest, a study in fight dynamics and a play on the homophobic Borat's complete willingness to engage in the grapple.<br /><br />What we're seeing is the id run amok, a movie that pretends as if children grew into full-size adults within the first 10 years of their lives, lacking an understanding in subversion and dark corners of the human heart. That's deep talk for what seems like such a goofy movie, but comedy occasionally does what drama cannot by throwing truth on a tilt to bring a shaded corner into light.<br /><br />We know that "Borat" is after more than cheap laughs because chunks of it just don't work. For me, anyway. The Pam Anderson material is dumb and overdone, but then, I'm no fan of Anderson. The dinner party sequence was lame, and Cohen is a little needlessly mean. If Jews want to accuse Cohen, who is Jewish, of self-hate, they could, but his use of anti-Semitism mostly highlights its stupidity.<br /><br />In other words, it's not searching, as most American comedies do, for a lowest common denominator, but erecting its own standard upon which to be judged. Cohen is a cagey, clever talent; while "Borat" is often improvised, the comedian had to map out these targets and create a humor that could survive the length of a feature film and not just a skit.<br /><br />"Borat" called its shot, slugged it into the cheap seats and just introduced us to the next year's No. 1 Halloween costume. Very nice, Mr. Cohen. Very nice.</p></body></html>

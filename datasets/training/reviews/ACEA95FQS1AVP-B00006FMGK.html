<meta name="summary" content="Blame the director, not the cast!"></head><body><p>This definitely could have been a better Star Trek movie, but it was still enjoyable.  I heard Marina Sirtis (the actress who plays Troi) talk about the flaws in this movie.  Most important was that the director never saw Star Trek before filming and never saw fit to watch any of it.  He wanted to make an action movie, which is what he did.  He cut out all the interpersonal relationships which make Trek what it is (check out the deleted scenes!).  He even wanted to cut the wedding completely out.<br /><br />That said, the villain was more engaging than the cookie-cutter villains in past TNG films, the special effects were great and the ending was surprisingly touching.  Worth the money!</p></body></html>

He had never made a comedy before.  His mastery of film was forged by his doing every single job in making little movies (and then REALLY BIG movies, like "Spartacus"), but especially his forte - cinematography.  He's a visual director, before and after this movie, and then tackles a talking head project...<br /><br />Peter Sellers was, by this time, reknowned for being a mimic and a great comic satirist.  And he'll advance that reputation beyond all measure here.<br /><br />George C. Scott gets top billing.  At the time of this movie, he was playing a dead-earnest social worker on an American TV show called "East Side/West Side."  To become a dissolute, crazed American general was breaking with type.<br /><br />Read the stories here about Slim Pickens and watch the film.  Do you believe that he did not know he was doing a satire?  I can't accept that.  It's a funny idea, though.<br /><br />Sterling Hayden?  Well, learn about his personal life before and after this movie.  He's a damn scary guy.<br /><br />But, getting back to Kubrick, notice the way the movie is lit.  Kubrick is reknowned for his cinematography and his meticulous nature.  For example, he might have been the only director who asked "A-list" actors to be present while lighting adjustments were made, versus getting stand-ins for lighting tests.  This insistence on perfection shows in this movie.  In many, many cases the lighting is below the action, creating a really strange, horror-movie effect.  There is indirector lighting, showcasing modernist architecture - to such an extent that modernism almost becomes a character in the movie.<br /><br />We created a modernist world.  It's self-image was that we've created nothing better than this world - we foresaw this world with "futuristic" looks at the potential of technology as seen in world fair (like the contemporary 1964 New York World's Fair).  This perfected technology has now destroyed us all, in the single catastrophic episode which ends this movie.<br /><br />But never forget:  it's not the end.  There was no mine shaft gap.</p></body></html>

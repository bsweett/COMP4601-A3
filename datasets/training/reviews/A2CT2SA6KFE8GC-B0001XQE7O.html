<meta name="summary" content="Return Of Burton"></head><body><p>If you take The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen and crossed it with Forest Gump, then you'll get a good idea of what Big Fish is like.  Tim Burton has always had a knack for taking bizarre subject matter and making a heartwarming movie out of it(like Edward Scissorhands).  Burton has certainly redeemed himself here after that rotten Planet Of The Apes remake with Marky Mark(Feel the vibrations!  Feel it, feel it!).  It's a whimsical, bizarre, funny fantasy with just the right amount of sappiness thrown in.  Some people might think the movie's just plain weird, but the human interest aspect of the story should overshadow the goofiness.  Interestingly enough, the opposite is true;  If you're too much of a man, the fantasy element is plentiful enough to make you forget about the touching father/son drama being played out.  Pretty well balanced if you ask me.  It doesn't look like other Burton films, most of this is in the daylight.  That's small potatoes coz his humor and style do still shine through.  I really hate to use this lame cliche, but this is a very good film for children and adults alike, though the adults are gonna get alot more out of it.</p></body></html>

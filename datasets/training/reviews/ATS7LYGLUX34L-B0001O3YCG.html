<meta name="summary" content="A Surprisingly Good Sci-Fi Thriller"></head><body><p>Pitch Black somehow managed to slip past me in it's original theatrical release, but the good word-of-mouth convinced me to buy the DVD. My original impression of the film turned out to be pretty much true: John Carpenter's "The Thing" meets "Alien". A diverse group of people are marooned on a desolate planet with three suns. One of the survivors, Riddick, (Played by Vin Diesel) is a mass-murderer/serial killer. The planet is inhabited by nocturnal, light-sensitive creatures who feed on human flesh....Luckily, the three suns force the Aliens to avoid the surface. Unfortunately for our hapless survivors, they've arrived just in time for a once-every-22-Years Total Eclipse....Is that the dinner bell I hear ringing....? And what's the bigger threat: The carnivorous Aliens or Riddick...?<p>  What sets Pitch Black apart is it's smart script. There are quite a few twists and turns here. Heroes who aren't so heroic, villains who might not be all that bad, a couple of unexpected deaths.....The effects are good, but don't overshadow the generally fine acting. Diesel did a good job as Riddick, but I did have to rewind and use the subtitles a LOT to catch some of Riddick's lines due to Diesel's mumbly delivery...<p>  The DVD has footage not seen in theaters, 2 seperate commentary tracks, theatrical trailers, production notes, cast & crew bios, a totally dopey "Pitch Black Raveworld Event" (20 minutes of people dancing while clips from the film play in the background), and a teeny-weeny little making-of featurette that clocks in at less than five minutes. Even though I'm not generally a fan of Vin Diesel's, if they do make a Riddick-based sequel, I'll be first on line....</p></body></html>

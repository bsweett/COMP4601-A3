It would be hard to imagine any other actor winning the Oscar for the Best Actor this year other than Jamie Foxx.  Not only did he get a nomination for his excellent work in "Collateral" for Best Supporting Actor, but I know now that he is a lock for Best Actor in "Ray."  From the television previews alone I thought he would get a nomination, but now that I've seen his performance in "Ray," well...there is no doubt at all that he will win.  The best parts of this film include Jamie Foxx in a tour-de-force performance, the music itself (which is elegantly staged), but also the highly underrated direction from Taylor Hackford.  Taylor Hackford richly deserves his Oscar-nomination for Best Director.  While it is true that the film does adhere to conventional storytelling techniques a little too often to make this film a seemless biopic, where the second half of Ray Charles life is basically hashed and fed to the audience in the final ten minutes of the film, what is shown here is often mesmerizing and enthralling.  The only real filmmaking flaw, as far as technical aspects are concerned, come in the form of the stylized film editing.  Some of the cuts include a circle of the next scene gradually becoming larger until it fills the whole screen, or the classic peel-away effect that shows a scene right on the heels of the one that just ended (a technique George Lucas used often in "Star Wars").  While these effects work occasionally, if they are used too much, as is the case in "Ray" it becomes noticable.  I would lose myself in Jamie Foxx's performance only to be reminded by the director that I am watching a movie via an over-used editing technique.  One edit he uses is actually very effective, where the camera slowly goes dark before the next scene begins.  At those times I felt I was inside Ray's head.  The best parts of the film more than make up for the mistakes; Taylor Hackford has enough inspired moments to merit his Oscar-nomination, the music is rendered beautifully, and Jamie Foxx is simply amazing.  The best compliment any actor can receive, I think, is that while watching his movie you forget he is an actor and completely believe he is the character being portrayed.  In this movie Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hot Tub Time Machine funny but the best part about it is the music"></head><body><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 7:23 Mins<br /><br /></span>Gina from Haunted Flower reviews "Hot Tub Time Machine" directed by Steve Pink and starring John Cusack, Rob Corddry, Craig Robinson, and Clark Duke. Four friends travel back in time with the help of a magic hot tub.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />There is the theatrical edition, but also the unrated edition not shown in theaters. There is a trailer and some deleted scenes. There were several screenings of this movie in Indianapolis so I saw a really early version of the film that contained some of these deleted scenes like Craig Robinson waiting on Thomas Lennon at the 'Sup Dawg grooming salon and John Cusack sharing his past to Lizzy Caplan in the ski lodge.<br /><br />These scenes include more detail of the 80s ski outfits as they wait for a turn skiing and Clark Duke gets to interact with his romantic interest more. There is also some pathetic begging by John Cusack for his girlfriend to take him back while she leaves him for Gunner. Lots of extra ad-libbing by Rob Corddry from the, uh, bathroom scene and Craig Robinson on the phone to the young girl version of his future wife and both are simply hysterical.<br /><br />Chevy Chase shows up in another enigmatic sequence to tell them the Hot Tub is like Dorothy's ruby slippers and they didn't need the energy drink...which could have saved them quite a bit of time in the movie if they had used it. All in all, if you loved this movie, you'll get to see more funny moments that didn't make the cut theatrically and the unrated version of the movie is pretty nuts!</p></body></html>

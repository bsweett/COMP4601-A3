<meta name="summary" content="It's not THAT bad"></head><body><p>Above and beyond all genres of film, horror takes the cake for me.  So when I heard about "The Grudge", how it was yet another version of "The Ring" (which "Ju-On also was), I was prepared to vomit, yes.<br /><br />This went beyond my expectations and had some genuinely frightening moments--no thanks to the lead performances of "who again?" Hollywood nonentities like Sarah Michelle Gellar or Bill Pullman.  Not even frightening moments exactly, frightening sequences, like when Matthew's sister is essentially tortured psychologically till she's sucked under the bed by that blue chick who crawls like she's really angry and really handicapped.<br /><br />This is a scary movie to a considerable degree.  Yeah, it's derivative, and yeah, they use the blue chick too much.  But there are some scary moments, and like the other reviewer said, it beats crap like Seed of Chucky.  Worth a rental.</p></body></html>

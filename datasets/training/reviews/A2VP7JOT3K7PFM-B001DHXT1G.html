You're probably wondering if this movie is similar to Ang Lee's 2003 movie "Hulk."  Surprisingly, it's not.  It's better!  How can this be?  Oh, it be!<br /><br />This movie is not a sequel to 2003's "Hulk" but rather is a reinvention that establishes a new back-story where Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton, who rewrote some of the script) becomes the Hulk as a pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate a "super soldier" program through gamma radiation.  (Why and how Banner becomes the Hulk is established in the movie's opening credits.)<br /><br />On the run, Banner attempts to cure himself of the Hulk before he's captured by General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross (William Hurt).  The General's worst fears are realized when power-hungry soldier (Tim Roth) becomes a similar but more Hulk-like creature (called the "Abomination").<br /><br />This movie has it all: action, drama, humour, (dare I say) incredible special effects, and good acting (with one exception).<br /><br />I missed Jennifer Connelly who played Dr. Elizabeth "Betty" Ross in the 2003 movie.  Here she's replaced by Liv Tyler who's rather bland.<br /><br />The CGI creation of the Hulk was quite good.  This movie did not over rely on special effects but let the actors do their jobs.  It was only at the end where (as you can probably guess) there's a confrontation between the Hulk and the Abomination that the movie becomes cartoon-like.<br /><br />Be sure to look for a few cameo appearances.  Do not miss, especially, Lou Ferrigno (who played the Hulk in the late 1970's television series).  He voiced the words said by the CGI Hulk in this movie.  (Lou...what a guy!!)<br /><br />I also liked the "Days without Incident" meter.  I thought this was a nice touch.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2008) has good picture and sound quality.  It has two extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a surprisingly entertaining Hulk movie.  Be sure to watch it to discover why you shouldn't get Bruce Banner mad.  (You wouldn't like him when he's mad.)<br /><br />(2008;  1 hr, 50 min;  wide screen;  20 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></body></html>

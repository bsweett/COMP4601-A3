<meta name="summary" content="A fitting end, better than Vol. 1 in many ways"></head><body><p>Tarantino is famous for his unpredictability.<br /><br />After the violence-heavy "Reservoir Dogs", came the plot-heavy "Pulp Fiction", then the character-driven (and, in my opinion, best-to-that-date movie) "Jackie Brown".<br /><br />Why, then, has it been such a shock to so many people that "Kill Bill Vol. 2" has not followed the same template as the excellent original?<br /><br />Picking up where we left off, The Bride is en-route to actually kill the titular Bill, and fills us in on the events up to that point. Gone is the yellow pleather, gone too are the Manga cutscenes, the Japanese hedonism, the bustling metropolitan cityscapes and the sense of mystery that the original movie had in spades.<br /><br />But replacing those things are some truly seminal Tarantino moments, like his glorious homage to the characters of  spaghetti-western, a magnificently-concieved Chinese Master, a truly grim buried-alive sequence, and all the missing pieces to the puzzle of "Kill Bill Vol. 1".<br /><br />Performance-wise, Thurman as The Bride is back on top form, and is edgy and cool as the woman who is out to reclaim her life. Michael Madsen gives a star turn as prodigal assassin Budd, his laziness and viciousness contrasting beautifully. Daryl Hannah is a joy as the disengaged, violent Elle Driver (her demise is a scene that will go down in Tarantino history as legend) and David Carradine is perfect as the eponymous Bill.<br /><br />Direction is Classic Tarantino. Whereas Volume 1 relied (some might say a little too heavily) on the "Quirky" factor, here most of the movie is shot in the desert, and Tarantino's artistry with a camera, as well as the talents of his perfect ensemble cast, are allowed to shine through, ggimmick-free. The fight between Elle Driver and The Bride in Budd's trailer is amazing, as is the flashback sequence in rural China.<br /><br />All in all, this truly is a Sequel that is an Equal, and in many ways, outstrips the original in terms of directorial mastery and wonderful performance.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

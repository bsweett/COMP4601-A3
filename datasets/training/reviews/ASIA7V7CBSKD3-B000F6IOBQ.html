Wonder what happened to the rest of the Coven?  How about Michael?  Still a little fuzzy on how the whole thing began?  Can't get enough Kate Beckinsale?<br /><br />Well that is all right here my friend.  Every thing you want to know and see.  Beckinsale is wonderful yet again and Scott Speedman continues his strong performance.<br /><br />You definately need both movies as they truly compliment (and feed - no pun intended) off of each other.</p></body></html>

Somehow this elegant period piece was much more enchanting than the thrillers and horror flicks that came streaming in from all directions. Edward Norton's fine performance and a fine supporting cast are greatly enhanced by the period sets and costumes all lit and styled with great taste.. We live in a world of illusion and this movie does a fine job of tickling and teasing us with this notion.. One can only hope that this will help to open the doors for similar projects in 2007..</p></body></html>

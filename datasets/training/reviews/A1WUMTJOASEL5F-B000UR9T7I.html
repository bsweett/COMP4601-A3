It's like they are expecting the superhero action to actually fit the frames of real life as we know it. (laugh) Well, if they did that, there would certainly be no men swinging from webs born from the wrists or men flying in from Krypton.<br />Personally I feel a little slighted when superhero flicks take themselves too seriously. Unless we filter in the topical criminal mind, and what makes him tick, we need not bother with the plot at all.<br />OK, so they did that in the previous two flicks, and chose not to follow in the same avenue of what makes a "criminal tick" in this one, focusing more on the relationship of Peter Parker and Mary Jane, which was fine with me. I don't view the superhero cartoons, or even Bugs Bunny with a yearning to find the origin of Yosemite Sam, and what's irking him. I simply accept his formidible non-compliance in dealing with his adversary.<br />Same with the multi villain plot here. Although we do get casual glimps of the villains "beefs", this movie does not dwell on them, and I accept that wholeheartedly. I spent enough time with Doc Ock's woes in the previous film, and I'm glad they chose to make this one more nonsense, as well as fun. I actually laughed more during this Spiderman, than the other ones, who took their subject matter very seriously. OH, WELL. . .it's still based on a "comic book"! HELLO!<br />One last note (no pun intended), I did not like the music video by Snow Patrol, and thought the movie ended on a solemn depressing exit for a dynamic series that has nothing to apologize for.</p></body></html>

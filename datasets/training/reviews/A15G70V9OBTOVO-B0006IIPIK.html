But I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Certainly the most fully formed vision of a world that never was since Blade Runner or perhaps The Fifth Element.  The obvious comparisons would be to the dreadful Rocketeer or the depressing Dark City (interestingly, both with Jennifer Connally who would have really made this a show stopper!)<br /><br />For those who don't get it this is a high tech retread of 1930s  art, movies and cartoons.  Just as Star Wars was a Flash Gordon/Buck Rogers ripoff, Sky Captain is based on a series of 30's motifs.  Specifically, the robots are from the Max Fleischer Superman Cartoon, "The Mechanical Monsters" (Paltrow is dressed as the Lois Lane character)  The landing decks in the sky were pictured in Popular Science.  Angela Jolie's group, her rocket belt, the rocket  "ark" and the hover craft are from Things To Come (with a dash of When Worlds Collide).  And the  giant figure at the end, holding the sword, must have been traced from the Tarna sequence in Heavy Metal.  Throw in Lost Horizon and a pinch of The Day The Earth Stood Still and you've got it.<br /><br />But somehow it all works.  Its stylish and I found it suprisingly fun.  There is so much detail it will be fun to examine it on DVD.  Why not 5 stars?  Because it was a little too long.</p></body></html>

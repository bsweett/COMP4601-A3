Upon his graduation, he is invited to be one of the first agents in the fledgling CIA.  At this time he has a tender romance with a young, hearing-impaired woman, but a moment's dalliance with a friend's sister (played by Angelina Jolie) results in her pregnancy and their marriage.  Edward leaves her to go overseas to England and thus begins a distant and emotionless marriage and fatherhood.  As the years go by, Edward becomes totally remote and secretive, stung by the cruelty and treachery that he has witnessed.  The role of Edward Wilson is a difficult one to play and Matt Damon does a credible job with it.  There are problems with the script which mar the film, and the constant flashbacks are distracting and confusing.  The premise of the film is a very interesting one, the birth and development of the CIA as seen through the life of one of its early agents, but the movie is cold and emotionless like the lead character, and is told in a monotone.  The length of the film only adds to the deadening effect.  The movie makes a noble effort to tell a story, but it falls short of its potential.</p></body></html>

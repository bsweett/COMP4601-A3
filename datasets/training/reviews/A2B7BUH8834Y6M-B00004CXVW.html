<meta name="summary" content="Masterfully made, far more than just eye candy"></head><body><p>This was sadly a sleeper in the box office, probably due to the theatrical trailer that made the film look more like some sort of demonic tale than what it was really about.<p>The special effects are out of this world, but  there aren't many of them... you don't need to see a lot of special effects  in this highly cerebral tale of realistic terror.<p>A city that seems to  never have sunlight and everyone goes to sleep at midnight.... well, almost  everyone.  Aliens driven to find out what makes the human species survive  adversity create a twisted zoo of human subjects who have no idea what is  going on and never realize that nothing is quite what it seems... with the  exception of John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), who seems to be the only person  to realize nothing is how it should be.<p>The psychological fear in the  film is far more powerful than anything you actually see, but the two  (visual and psychological) exacerbate one another... you will be on the  edge of your seat through out.<p>This dual-sided feature-packed DVD  includes the theatrical trailer, cast bios, and full-length audio  commentaries; one by Roger Ebert, who (rightfully so) dubbed this the best  film of 1998 and the second commentary has audio from the Director,  writers, production designers and the director of photography.  This is the  first DVD I ever bought and I've seen it several times... it is exquisitely  executed and a standard by which other DVD presentations should be measured  in terms of what the DVD medium is all about.<p>The film contains nudity  and violence and is not suitable for children.  Don't let the comparisons  with &quot;The Matrix&quot; fool you, this is a film and genre in its own  right, but you will see some parallels once you've seen both movies.  The  film has been more closely tied with the epic Sci-Fi silent classic,  &quot;Metropolis.&quot; The DVD includes blow-by-blow comparisons of this  film w/ &quot;Metropolis&quot; as well as an interactive game (can be  played using a remote control on your TV or by your mouse)... well worth  the money and a treat for those who love movies that entertain by  stimulating the mind.</p></body></html>

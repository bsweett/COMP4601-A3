<meta name="summary" content="A fable about what a waste of time anger is"></head><body><p>When her husband's secretary goes back to Sweden and then her husband disappears, Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) puts two and two together.  As far as Terry is concerned, her husband no longer exists and is dead to her and their four daughters.  At the start of "The Upside of Anger" Terry is not so much angry as she is drunk.  When next door neighbor and former baseball player Denny Davies (Kevin Costner) finds out about Terry's situation, both the news that her husband is gone and the fact that she is drinking all of the time, he walks into her house and into her life.  Denny's reasons for doing so are not clear.  He could just be looking for a new drinking partner, or he could be recognizing a person whose life has just crumbled beneath then.  Then again, maybe he just wants sex.  But when Terry decides she just wants sex, Denny flees, so we have to think there is more going on.<br /><br />The relationship between Terry and Denny is the main plotline of "The Upside of Anger," but in addition to the missing husband and deciding what is up with this new man suddenly in her life, Terry has to deal with four daughters.  Hadley (Alicia Witt) is about to graduate college and has a double-dose of news for her mother.  Andy (Erika Christensen) does not want to go to college and just wants to work, which is also news for Terry.  Emily (Keri Russell) is a dancer who wants to go to a small arts college, ideas that Terry disparages.  Then there is "Popeye" (Evan Rachel Wood), real name Lavender, who is the narrator of the film in those few instances where we cannot be told a profound thought any other way.  It is hard enough for Terry to deal with being an abandoned wife without her daughter's throwing an increasingly frustrating number of new monkey wrenches into her life as well.  Consequently, there are moments where the dialogue gives way to inarticulate grunts and a particular memorable death wish daydream at the family dining room table.<br /><br />I do not have a problem with the conclusion put together by writer-director Mike Binder ("The Sex Monster," "The Search for John Gissing").  Since I have the firm conviction that irony is the master trope of the universe, I appreciate the twist at the end of this one.  Furthermore, I think that it underscores the message of the film, a conclusion I reached before I did the extras on this DVD and found out precisely what Binder says is his thesis proposition.  Binder wrote the script specifically for Allen, so it is not surprising that her performance is on point, but Costner is equally as good in what is essentially a supporting role (his best moments are when he wins "Popeye" over and kicks down the bathroom door).  It is not surprising that the four young actresses basically jumped on board because they wanted to work with Joan Allen (clearly there is a big upside to doing so).<br /><br />My main complaint with this movie ends up being that it does not have enough deleted scenes.  Dealing with what is happening between Terry and Denny is enough without trying to provide equal time to all four of the daughters.  After all, it is not like this is adopted from a novel that you can go read after the fact to find out more about the characters.  Binder wrote a script and not a novel, so this is all there is and there ain't no more.  But I wish there was because it is the complexity of Terry's relationship with her daughters and how they all deal with Denny and the absent father.  "The Upside of Anger" feels like it has the depth of a novel, which is a pretty good compliment for a movie of this sort.<br /><br />Plus, you have to like any writer-director who writes a script in which his leading lady gets to slap him not only around but actually all the way down to the groud.  The fact that Binder filmed this story, set in a Detroit suburb, at the Ealing Studios in London, is also impressive.  Now the big question is whether the Academy will remember Joan Allen at Oscar time, because she should at least get a nomination out of this one (her performance is certainly better than all five of last year's nominees).</p></body></html>

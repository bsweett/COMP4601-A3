<meta name="summary" content="Taxi Driver (1976)"></head><body><p>Director:  Martin Scorsese<br />Cast:  Robert DeNiro, Harvey Keitel, Cybill Shepherd, Jodie Foster, Peter Boyle.<br />Running Time:  120 minutes.<br />Rated R for a scene of extreme violence and language.<p>All of us have known, in some shape or form, how Travis Bickle (played brilliantly by Robert DeNiro) feels.  There is a time in every person's life in which he/she feels isolated from the world, perhaps out of place or unjustly a receiver of misfortune.  Travis, on the other hand, is consumed by this sense of loneliness and despair, taking it to the brink of pure destruction and maniacal proportions.<p>DeNiro is hauntingly right on as the former Vietnam veteran who decides to get a job as a taxi driver for the streets of New York City.  As he cruises the big-city landscape, he realizes all of the hidious crime, starvation, murder, death, and macabre that consumes society.  When he is rejected by a love interest (Shepherd) due to his out-of-the-norm behavior, Travis begins a downward spiral:  he begins to train as if he were still in the military, buys numerous firearms and weapons, and ultimately plans to stage an assasination attempt on one of the political candidates planning to take over the city.<p>When Travis meets a twelve-year old prostitute (Jodie Foster, in a extremely profound and witty introductory performance), his motivations for violence and release are geared towards the awful individuals who have taken this poor girl into their possession and are encouraging her into a filthy profession.  This hatred for filth causes Travis to explode, creating a tormenting, horrific climax that will be remembered as one of the most severe in film history.  &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; is certainly an acquired taste and not a film for all adults.  It is a strikingly honest tale of how the inner troubles of a man can be extremely exaggerated, to the point that he knows no boundaries.<p>Director Scorsese uses dark camera angles and vivid images to portray his story, incorporating a musical score that embodies the essence of the film: an unoffensive saxaphone that dwindles into a deep, resounding boom.  A film that can shock and chill, one that should be celebrated for its original genius, but also a work that is almost too graphic and emotionally-draining to enjoy.</p></body></html>

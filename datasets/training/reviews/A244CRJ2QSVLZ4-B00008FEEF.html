It begins exactly where the first one ended - Michael Myers is shot and falls from the balcony.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance reprise their roles as Laurie Strode and Dr. Sam Loomis.  John Carpenter and Debra Hill wrote the suspenseful script and Rick Rosenthal provided great direction.  The eerie trademark soundtrack from the original is also used in this superb sequel.<br /><br />  If you enjoy a high body count, you will enjoy "Halloween II."  Michael Myers pursues Laurie Strode to the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital; he begins dispatching the entire staff within its sanitized, claustrophobic corridors.  In this sequel, we learn why Michael Myers is intent on destroying Laurie.  We also learn that Michael Myers is well versed in the ancient occult religion of Druidism.<br /><br />  Michael Myers is Samhain, the Lord of the Dead.  He can't be killed because he is already dead.  Satanic evilness has possessed his body and given it the illusion of life.  Bullets and fire can not stop him.<br /><br />  This film is a must see for fans of high body count slasher flicks and horror films set at hospitals.  "Visiting Hours" is also highly recommended.</p></body></html>

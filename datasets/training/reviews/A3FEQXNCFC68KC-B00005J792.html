You get all the same kind of engrossing mystery as in Sixth Sense, but this time with a little dose of comic book "what if?" is thrown in the mix. What comes out is a seriously cool adaptation to a theme that just about every one of us has imagined at least one time in our lives. What would it be like to have super powers?<br /><br />Just like his other thrillers. The beauty of the movie is slowly learning what the heck is going on. You go through this ordinary security guard's tribulation of finding out if he really is nigh invulnerable. The story is done really well in this aspect. You get really swept away in this trek to find the truth. Many of the scenes use color, sound and other cinematography techniques to bring out an even greater artistic enhancement of storytelling. These techniques almost make you feel like you are seeing techniques used in comic books to enhance the story in a subtle and realistic way. Very, very nice!<br /><br />The acting is superb. Bruce Willis has never disappointed me yet. When he is needed to show strength you see the inner strength. When he needed to be a vulnerable character you can see it in his eyes and the way he carries himself. Masterful work. Samuel L. Jackson plays his role as Elijah Price so well that you almost think Jackson himself is the infinitely frail. He also has a great presence and complexity that further makes him perfect for the role.<br /><br />Like most of Shyamalan's other movies this one isn't action based, in spite of what the story is about. Unbreakable is, however, an excellent coming-of-super-age type story with one doozy of a surprise ending... an early Shyamalan trademark. If you absolutely, positively need lots of action in your films then you might as well pass this one. However you will miss out. Anybody who likes to see more depth in his or her heroes you won't see anything better on any superhero movie hands down. Don't deprive your mind of this brain food. It's a winner.<br /><br />I don't really see a very compelling reason to get this Blu-Ray if you already own the two-disc Vista series DVD. The visuals don't seem like they have improved that much, but then again I didn't compare the two versions side by side. I won't say the picture isn't significantly better, but I will say it's not the kind of visual pop you would find on movies people use as high def references. Now the audio on the Blu-Ray is PCM 5.1 lossless and it's really nice. You get to hear a lot of subtle audio queues that may or may not be noticeable on the previous releases (again I didn't compare the two side by side).<br /><br />The special features are a 100% rehash of the Vista series extras with absolutely nothing new to the table. This kinda dissapoints me, but in the end most of the time when they make a Blu-Ray exlusive featurette it sometimes tends to be throwaway content. Here's what you get:<br /><br />Behind the Scenes - A documentary of interviews from the cast and crew. Not bad, but not groundbreaking.<br /><br />Comic Books and Superheroes - A cool analysis of comic book heroes and villans. Shows that Samuel Jackson does have a love for the genre.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes - There are some really cool scenes that were taken out and now you get to enjoy them. Some, of course, are obvious why they were taken out. My favorite is the weighlifting scene at the college gym.<br /><br />The Train Station Sequence - Uses the multiple angles feature to switch between the movie and the storyboards. Not really interesting unless you plan to direct.<br /><br />Night's First Fight Sequence - One a Shyamalan's home movies depicting the title sequence. Just shows the budding directory building his chops as a teen with a camcorder. Interesting bit of historic trivia, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />I didn't feel the Blu-Ray really stood out on the visual end, but it did look really good. I would have liked to have seen some more content on this release like maybe a director commentary, maybe an analytical retrospective. Something new. If you already have the Vista series DVD I can't say with 100% certainty this is the one to get. I keep wondering if a new and improved Blu-Ray release will come down the pike with more features or maybe a director's cut adding some of those deleted scenes into a longer movie. If you don't have the Vista series DVD then your choice is easier as you get all the special features plus the improved visuals (likely) and audio (definitely).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="He's not dead, the second shooter was in Yugoslavia and killed Archduke Ferdinand not on the grassy knoll in Dallas"></head><body><p>The hubbub around JFK's death in Dallas is just too extreme and bizarre.  There's not enough money to be gained to kill a POTUS so publicly.  The second shooter represents the second shooter working for the Hapsburgs and their Germanic warmongers who wanted to get rid of a useless monarch - their Archduke Ferdinand.  The convicted shooter was a young Yugoslav whose earlier attempt failed because he had a JAMMED gun so when the Archduke fell later, he was surprised albeit pleased.  There was a second shooter and somehow the Allies know a lot more about German crimes in waging constant world war (though officially designated WWI and WW2) than the public is allowed to know about.</p></body></html>

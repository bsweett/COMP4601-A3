<meta name="summary" content="This is not a romantic comedy"></head><body><p>It may look like it on the cover, but not!!!, I watched this & could not help but wonder if Natalie Portman & Julia Roberts were smoking crack when they signed on for this, this film is about four people(Jude Law & Clive Owen, being the other two) who get together with one another, & break up with one another, none of them are very likable, in fact, all four are downright distasteful, the dialogue is outrageous, I thought for minute I might have been watching a porn movie, Owen & Roberts, who are very talented utter some extreme dialogue, that you can't actually believe they are saying it, only in a porn film do you here this kind of talk, not that it offended me, but surprised me is more like it, Portman even gets raunchy toward the end, you can't help but wonder if all four should get together at once & get it over with,  I found it very hard to watch, but did see it till the end, & yet the ending is confusing, If you want to see Portman, Roberts, Owen, & Law in somthing different & distasteful, this is your movie!!!</p></body></html>

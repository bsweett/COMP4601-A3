<meta name="summary" content="A mediocre movie in search of a genre - and failing to find one."></head><body><p>Sandra Bullock puts in a great performance of a confused and conflicted women unsure of reality.  Perhaps she was channelling how she felt about being in the movie, because the script is entirely undeserving of her attentions.<br />Not that it is completely without merit - the concept of a woman who lives the days of a week out of order giving her first a chance to know her husband is going to die, and then perhaps a chance to change it before it happens, is quite a good one.  The opportunity is wasted though, as plot logic flies through the window, along with our suspension of belief.  Apart from a brief chat with a priest, no explanation is given as to how this premonition happens, or why it would happen to her.  The plot therefore leads you on with the hook of `will she make it?' in a ticking clock sort of way, before fizzling out into a stock-heartwarming message about how we approach life being as important as death etc etc.  Not that it's a bad message, but the movie just does not decide which way it is going until the end... and it is too late to rescue an audiences involvement.<br />On the plus side, music is good - both suspenseful and melancholic by turns, and the acting across the board is good - with the exception perhaps of the husband, who fails to convince us of being the man that would hold Bullock's devotion the way he does.<br />Not a complete disaster, but neither is it worthy of a recommendation - for Bullock completists only.</p></body></html>

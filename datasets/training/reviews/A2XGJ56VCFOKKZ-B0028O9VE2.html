<meta name="summary" content="A film that defies your expectations...muy muy fabuloso!"></head><body><p>I avoided seeing this film in theaters because it just didn't seem very interesting. Even after it has been on dvd for awhile, I hesitated renting it and the biggest reason is because it was victimized by false marketing. My guess is that the studios didn't know how to market it, and because it stars Adam Sandler, they decided to market it as a comedy, which is a huge mistake. I consider this film to be a drama with comedic elements...but if you're looking for the goofy style comedy of past Adam Sandler films, you're in for a huge disappointment.<br /><br />It's a shame, really, because this film doesn't fit any neat category. It must be viewed with an open mind (and an open heart wouldn't hurt either). There are some unbelievable stretches that don't work...such as the marriage between Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni. Throughout the whole film, I wondered why they were even a couple. They had little in common and clashed about everything, particularly the role of parental responsibility. If I hadn't seen "The Family Man" where I actually loved Tea Leoni's performance in that film, I would not have been impressed with her here. She plays a very annoying, obsessive and eccentric mother/housewife, who acts without thinking. She's impulsive, intense, and downright irritating. Self-absorbed/self-obsessed to pay any attention to her daughter or husband. I simply couldn't figure her out and her eccentric behavior only made me empathize with Adam Sandler even more.<br /><br />Adam Sandler does seem out of place in a film like this. As often is the case, he plays the likeable hero whom audiences love. This film is a bit of a stretch, as he plays a father, husband, and award-winning chef. The last part really strained credibility with me. Together, as a couple, Sandler and Leoni are affluent Los Angeles suburbanites who can afford a fulltime housekeeper, played wonderfully by Paz Vega. This film belongs to Paz Vega, as the POV is from her daughter and the focus sits square on her shoulders. She is an amazing find and the reason why I rate this film so high. She has an uncanny resemblance to actress Penelope Cruz and if any Hollywood moguls are reading this review, those two should play sisters in some film one day!!!<br /><br />The clash of cultures begin when the housekeeper Flor (Paz Vega) begins to work, as she doesn't speak English and the family doesn't speak Spanish. They get by with all manner of comedic misunderstandings, until Flor decides to learn English. What surprises me with this film is that it moves in a certain direction that makes you think where it will end up, yet turns in a surprising way that is actually profound. Ultimately, this film is about boundaries. The American family are too inconsiderate of their housekeeper as they try to "Americanize" her daughter in a way the mother doesn't approve, so she has to decide how best to maintain the sense of boundary and self-respect. The other surprise of this film is Cloris Leachmann, who is a wonderful actress in her own right and she gives the best advice any mother could give a daughter (she plays the alcoholic mother of Tea Leoni's character). I would have loved to see a larger role for her in this film, but she is a joy to watch in every scene she's in.<br /><br />The reason why I give it a perfect score of 5 stars is because of actresses Paz Vega, Cloris Leachman, and the two girls who play the daughters; along with the surprising turns this film makes; and the overall message one receives at the end of the movie. Quite profound on the clash of cultures, the nature of families, and how best to handle temptations. It is a remarkable film that should have been better advertised to find the right audience. People expecting a typical Adam Sandler comedy will naturally be disappointed, but people expecting a drama with some humor will most likely surprised, in a good way.</p></body></html>

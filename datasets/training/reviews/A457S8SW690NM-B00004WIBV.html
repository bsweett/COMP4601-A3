It is a dark movie putting Washington Irving's classic story to the big screen. The movie is therefore about Ichobod Crane (Johnny Depp) sent to Sleepy Hollow from New York to investigate a series of murders. The murders all have one thing in common. The murdered people all have been decapitated and their heads are missing. Everyone in the town thinks that the headless horseman is the murderer. Crane thinks that they are joking until he has an encounter with him.<br /><br />The movie is fascinating with a haunting score by Danny Elfman, gorgeous visuals, wonderful acting and an awesome ending. The movie also has awesome fights and adventure scenes.<br /><br />This movie is definitely on my top 25 films of all time. It's a movie that everyone should see. The visuals alone make this a must see. It's a movie that I will definitely rewatch soon and a lot in the future. This isn't worth a rent. NO, BUY IT!!!!!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT! You rock Tim Burton!</p></body></html>

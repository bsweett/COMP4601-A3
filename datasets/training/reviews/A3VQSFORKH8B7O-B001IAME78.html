<meta name="summary" content="MARVEL STUDIOS HITS 2 FOR 2 WITH "THE INCREDIBLE HULK!" (Some Spoilers)"></head><body><p>Marvel Studios followed their exceptional "Iron Man" with "The Incredible Hulk," another terrific comic book adaptation. Dispensing with the overall seriousness of the previous film, the Ang Lee-directed "The Hulk," this film returns to the storyline as seen in the 1978 television show. In fact, one of the film's pluses is that it brings elements from the show into the film, such as Lou Ferrigno, who lends his voice to the Hulk, as well as a cameo appearance as a security guard; and the TV theme makes a welcomed return.<br />While not as good as "Iron Man," this is a terrific film that features some awesome action sequences, terrific visual effects and fine storytelling. The performances are good as well. Edward Norton is great as Bruce Banner, bringing the character elements that Bill Bixby made famous, while also adding some great little character nuances, while not making the character too dark or depressing, such as Tobey McGuire did in the overrated "Spider-man" films. The beautiful and talented Liv Tyler provides some smarts and sexyness as Banner's love interest, while William Hurt and Tim Roth give menacing performances as Banner's villainous rivals. And a welcomed cameo by Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark is not only memorable, but also continues the march toward "The Avengers" in 2011.<br />With "The Incredible Hulk," Marvel Studios has made two well-done superhero films. If you enjoyed the original TV series or the comic books, then you'll surely enjoy "The Incredible Hulk!"<br />Movie/DVD Grade: A</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="They Don't Get any Better."></head><body><p>This is a very unsual film, and it's actors fit every part they were cast in.  Story about a group of soldiers kidnaped during the Korean war and taken to Manchuria, where Laurence Harvey is somehow brainwashed and manipulated to respond to commands no matter where or when.  The surreal scene where the soldiers are captured is very unusual, and reminded me a little of the dream sequence in the Hitchcock film, Spellbound, though they are very different.<br /><br />When they all get home, the Major played by Frank Sinatra  begins to have disturbing dreams. He learns that a plot must be uncovered and eventually figures out that Shaw (HarveY) is a trigger man who responds to a card, the Queen of Diamonds, magnificently played by Angela Lansbury.  Frank Sinatra is great as the Major who uncovers the secret and Laurence Harvey plays Shaw the victim of the gross plot.  A true thriller in every sense of the word.  In fact, one the best films I've ever seen.</p></body></html>

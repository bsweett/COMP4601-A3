The 3D was pretty good and added to the overall feel of the movie. I really enjoyed it, as with every Johnny Depp movie. He is a very gifted actor. Tim Burton is just unbelievable with the stories he comes up with. If you haven't seen this yet be sure to check it out, and in 3D if possible.</p></body></html>

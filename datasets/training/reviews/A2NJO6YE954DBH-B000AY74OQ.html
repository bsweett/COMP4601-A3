<meta name="summary" content="But what are Mommy and Daddy laughing at?"></head><body><p>"Madagascar" must be a very maddening movie for young kids who go with their parents, because at moments when they are not laughing their parents very well could be and the kiddies will have no clue why.  After all, how many pre-teens have seen the end of the original version of "The Planet of the Apes," the beginnings of "Saturday Night Fever" and "Chariot of Fire," or have even heard the theme song from "Born Free"?  I expect they may have seen "Castaway" and might well recognize a homage to the dancing hippos from "Fantasia," but is it reasonable to think they saw "The Twilight Zone" episode "To Serve Man"?  I realize that when kids are laughing they probably are not aware of what their parents or guardians are doing, but since they will not be laughing at most of these pop culture references to other films, they may well be awrae that the older people are watching a different movie.<br /><br />Ultimately the problem is that the different "Madagascar" that the grownups are watching is clearly funnier than the one that is trying to keep the wee folk entertained.  The story is about four animals who are best buds at the Central Park Zoo.  Alex the Lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) is the star of the show and a devotee of raw steak, while Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock) is tired of looking at the fake jungle painted on the wall and longs to be free in the wild, not really knowing what that means.  Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) is a hypochondriac, worried about the brown spots on his skin, while Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinikett Smith), is a rather contented soul.  But when the quartet of penguins decide to make a break for Antarctica, Marty gets out on the streets of New York City, which forces Alex and the others to rescue him.  Their trip to Grand Central Station is seen by the humans as a quest for freedom and against the will of three of the four friends, they are crated up and put on a ship bound for Africa so they can be happy (the humans who come up with this saw the movie "Free Willy," but never read the news stories about what happened when the star of those films was released into the ocean).<br /><br />To say that they end up in Madagascar rather than Africa might seem like a minor distinction since the island is off the coast of the continent and therefore part of the same land mass, but it is important that the place is NOT Africa.  Africa is a place where there are prides of lions, herds of zebras, and so forth.  Madagascar is a place where there is a division between the lemurs and their small friends, ruled by the wacky Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen), who is advised by the more sedate Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer), and the hyenas, who do not talk, following the tradition of really bad animals in movies populated by talking animals (e.g., the rats in "Lady and the Tramp").  This matters because it makes the newcomers the biggest animals around (the "New York giants" to the locals), and Alex a true king of the jungle (he terrifies the hyenas when he is not trying to and Julian wants Alex to try really hard to terrify the hyenas).<br /><br />"Madagascar" is an anti-"Call of the Wild" in that the biggest conflict becomes not the ability of the zoo animals to survive in the wild or to save the lemurs from the hyenas, but rather keeping Alex from converting to his natural state in which case Marty and the others are literally the walking steaks he misses so much.  Few friendships can survive one friend sinking their teeth into the butt of another, and the tightrope this 2005 animated film must walk is that we have to fear that Alex is going to eat the rest of the cast.  But then we remember, to adapt the wise words of Chandler Bing, that this would just mean they stop drawing the zebra.  However, it is hard to complain about the rhetorical aspects of a film whose chief message is that you should not eat your friends (I bet small kids would get the idea that film is the anti-"Silence of the Lambs").  Not a classic by any means, but I know how often I laughed out loud, so I have to round up.</p></body></html>

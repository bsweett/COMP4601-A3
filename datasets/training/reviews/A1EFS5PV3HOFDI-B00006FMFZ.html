<meta name="summary" content="Road to salvation"></head><body><p>This movie is so absolutely heartbreaking, the ending did nothing to lighten the mood of the film. Even so, Road to Perdition is a wonderful movie of how one mans decisions can decide the future of his family and those surrounding him.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is wonderful as the hitman working to feed his family while keeping his two boys from finding out what he does. Out of curiousity, the elder of the two decides to follow his father to work, just to discover the horrible truth of his work. To keep the secret safe, the boss's son is sent to kill the son, but ends up killing the younger son along with his mother. So begins a race to stay ahead of death and destruction, and Tom Hank's ultimate goal to save the soul of his son.<br /><br />Jude Law plays the crazy hitman who has a passion for photagraphing his dead victims to grace his walls, and who is sent after Micheal Sullivan and his son. What transpires between these three is the height and ending purpose to the entire movie. Sad, but with shades of hope as the sons life is forever changed for the better.</p></body></html>

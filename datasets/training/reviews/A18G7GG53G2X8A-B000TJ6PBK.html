<meta name="summary" content="Hotel Hell"></head><body><p>In a Haunted Hotel story, it always starts with a warning: Don't stay in that one room. It's haunted. It's evil. Such is the way that "1408" starts, an opening that inevitably leads to a series of nightmarish supernatural occurrences. But rather than bombarding the audience with cliched images of ghosts and monsters, the film effectively gets under the audience's skin by adding uncomfortable subtleties. Example: there's a moment when John Cusack passes a painting while in room 1408. He sees that it's slightly crooked. It wasn't like that when he first entered the room. Moments such as these build up as the film advances, resulting in a story that doesn't shock so much as it unnerves. In short, this is a film that takes us on one heck of a ride.<br /><br />And no wonder; it's based on the short story by Stephen King. In the collection "Everything's Eventual," he introduces "1408" by saying, "hotel rooms are just naturally creepy places, don't you think? I mean, how many people have slept in that bed before you? How many of them were sick? How many were losing their minds?" I must admit that I don't put much thought into hotel rooms. Still, such unpleasant ideas ring true. The filmmakers must have known this; those very words were used as dialogue for Cusack's character Mike Enslin, a man who makes his living writing about reputedly haunted locations. Following the death of his daughter, he no longer believes in anything, least of all in ghosts. When he learns of New York City's Dolphin Hotel and the history behind room 1408 (whose digits add up to thirteen), he only sees it as an opportunity to add material to his next book. He intends to stay overnight.<br /><br />The manager of the hotel--Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson)--desperately tries to talk Enslin out of it, as such characters do in such stories. Room 1408 has been associated with many deaths during the Dolphin's ninety-plus year history: there was the sewing machine salesman that slit his own throat; there was the man that drowned in a bowl of soup; there was the woman that jumped from the room's window. Today, no one stays in room 1408. The only people who enter it are the maids, who give the room a very quick turn every month. The sheets are changed. The towels are replaced. The light bulbs are fixed. According to Olin, it's similar to holding your breath in a room filled with poison gas: everything has to be done quickly. This is because no one who stays in that room will last for more than an hour. Something is in that room. Not a ghost, but definitely something.<br /><br />Enslin listens but refuses to reconsider. He sees Olin's words as nothing more than scare tactics, a way to drum up publicity for the hotel. Olin insists that he's being quite serious. Whatever the case, Enslin eventually receives the key to room 1408, an old-fashioned metal key that fits into an old-fashioned lock (the hotel has upgraded to magnetic cards, but according to Olin, nothing electronic will work in 1408). The room is located on the fourteenth floor ... but actually, it isn't. During the elevator ride, Enslin notices that the floor numbers go from twelve directly to fourteen; apparently, a thirteenth floor is highly frowned upon in many hotels. Either way, Enslin enters room 1408.<br /><br />Thus begins a highly intense, horrific journey, highlighted by unexplainable occurrences, terrifying images, and otherworldly encounters. I won't bother describing them in detail: for one thing, it would be difficult to do so; for another thing, you really should experience this film for yourself. Let's be incredibly vague and say that many strange and frightening things happen, all of which force Enslin to reexamine his state of mind. For the horror movie aficionado, this film is delightfully unsettling, filled to the brim with pop out scares, spooky sounds, and startling twists of fate. At the same time, it utilizes smaller, quieter moments, such as when Enslin bathes the room in ultraviolet light, exposing large areas that were once covered with blood. In the hands of a lesser director, all this could have amounted to mere shock value, great to look at but lacking any substance.<br /><br />Luckily, there's genuine imagination at work in "1408," so much so that it begins to get overwhelming. But that's how it should be; Enslin is learning the hard way, and the audience needs to be aware of this. Ultimately, I felt the same way leaving the theater as I did when finishing King's original story: thrilled. It doesn't matter that this film adaptation isn't completely faithful to its source; the story served more as a springboard than a strict guideline, allowing for many ideas to be expanded and solidified. When Cusack's strong performance is added to the mix, it gets even better; for most of the film, he had to act while alone in a hotel room, surrounded by a wealth of special effects. Nonetheless, he shows terrific range, relying on an emotional gamut that's just as convincing as it is intense.<br /><br />"1408" is one of the better Stephen King adaptations of recent memory, a carefully crafted fright fest that knows how to make the audience uncomfortable. It's engaging, exciting, and genuinely terrifying, perfect for anyone in need of a good scare.</p></body></html>

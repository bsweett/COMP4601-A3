The viewer is never really challenged but, rather, is taken along for a comfortable journey.<br /><br />In essence, the film involves a series of corporate takeovers in America where a comparatively na?ve young executive Carter Duryea (Topher Grace) and that's not a mis-spelling, is placed in charge of a department formerly managed by Dan Forman (Dennis Quaid).  The 26 year old apparent wunderkind has the 51 year old offsider.  Yet to further muddy the waters, Duryea falls in love with Forman's university student daughter.  Forman, needless to say, is less than impressed.<br /><br />In a somewhat formulaic process, the young pretender learns a few things about life the hard way.  Experience triumphs over youthful ambition.  Duryea leaves for a new, perhaps simpler, life and Forman returns to the fold back in his old job.  The young lovers go there own way.  A lesson is learned and there are no hard feelings.<br /><br />Would I recommend this film to others?  Well, yes, but only as a piece of escapism.  Do not expect to be challenged or made to question motives and outcomes.  See the film just for the fun of it.</p></body></html>

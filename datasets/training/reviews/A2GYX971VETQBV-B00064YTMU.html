<meta name="summary" content="An Outstanding Film by Absolutely Any Standard"></head><body><p>In the past few years, I have fallen away from movies with Tom Cruise in them, feeling that he just hasn't been hitting the mark lately.  But under the direction of Michael Mann, Tom Cruise finds his pacing and delivers one of the best performances of his career.  Combine his character with the recent explosion of Jamie Foxx and you have the makings of a great movie.  Both Cruise and Foxx guide COLLATERAL to its explosive conclusion, all the while managing to shed light on their characters and explore real emotion.  I just could not find something not to like about this film while watching it.  The opening sequences are great, the dialogue is superb, and the imagery is extraordinary.  Los Angeles comes alive in COLLATERAL and Mann's picture seems to be a tribute to its scenic locations and nightlife.  I even noticed the quality of the soundtrack, not normally something to which I pay an inordinate amount of attention.<br /><br />Ultimately, I found COLLATERAL interesting because of the depth of its two main characters.  Take Cruise's character, for instance.  I was expecting a typical "hitman" character: no sense of morality, quick-decision maker, etc.  But what we get is someone who brings complexity to his position, someone who seems to develop a friendship & care for the cabdriver who has been ushering him around all night, someone who behind all of the grime has a personal code of ethics.  Of course, at the end of the day he is what he is.  But Cruise manages to squeeze a lot more life into the character than I had expected, particularly in the scenes where we learn about his childhood experiences.  Opposite Cruise stands Foxx, a simple cabdriver who has been putting off his dreams for twelve years, afraid of the commitment and the responsibility.  But he is also a man capable of great heroism and courage, witnessed several times throughout the film in short bursts.<br /><br />What I really loved about COLLATERAL, however, is how it manages to communicate the haphazard nature of life.  The opening sequence is particularly illustrative as Cruise only ends up in Foxx's cab as an accident.  Small decisions in this film have ripple effects that change the course of each characters' life.  This is not a film of fate.  It is a film of personal free will and the chaos of our decisions.  It is a film that preaches agency over the chains of predetermined outcomes.  And it transforms the audience as it transforms its characters.  COLLATERAL is one of Michael Mann's best films to date and an absolute must-see for everyone.</p></body></html>

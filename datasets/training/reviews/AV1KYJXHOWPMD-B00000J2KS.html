<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as the book, but still a very good movie by Stanley Kubrick."></head><body><p>The film is not as good as the fantastic novel. Mainly because they went a little overboard on the violence and sexuality. I give the film four and a half stars. I could say that this is close to being a classic. I liked they guy who played Alex's father better on The Shining. But still, Malcolm McDowell was born to play Alex he was perhaps the best actor in the film. Recommended to Kubrick fans.</p></body></html>

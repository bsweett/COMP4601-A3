<meta name="summary" content="What ever happened to Tom Hulce? ..."></head><body><p>So what can really be said about a film in a review that arrives 24 years after the film's first release?<br /><br />First, I cannot believe that it's already been that long. I saw this film in a theatre in England as a boy and it was one of the highlights of my movie going youth. And yes, I'm that old ... or young. Take your pick, dear reader.<br /><br />So, what did become of Tom Hulce? He was absolutely shocking in this movie as a portrayal of one of the greatest composers / humans ever to live. Well, for the record Tom Hulce, kind of decided that it must be cool to put on some weight, because that's exactly what he went and did. He also became a producer doing projects of his own liking. He was also recently in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LXH0AE">Stranger Than Fiction</a>, but if you don't look fast you just might miss him.<br /><br />Regarding the film ... a lot of viewers often come away with the belief that this is an intensely accurate story about the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, which in fact it is a story about Mozart, but it is not all that accurate. This is a movie that was based upon a stage play called "Mozart and Salieri". What it does capture though, is period set design, wardrobe and atmosphere and it does it so well that any story told within this shell could be utterly believable and engrossing.<br /><br />However, all these things aside, this is an incredibly strong film to say the least and one of my all time favourites. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000000XBT">The music</a> is beautifully woven throughout this to carry you back to the life of a would-be madman and reckless drunkard. It's a blessing that he did not wallow in obscurity and is still esteemed as highly as he is today, for WAM, so deserves it.<br /><br />If you are the type of person that prefers accurate portrayals in their bio-pic features, then you should probably see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K3TN">Immortal Beloved</a>, as it is about as true of an account of that Composers life as you're going to see and is wonderfully captured by Gary Oldman.</p></body></html>

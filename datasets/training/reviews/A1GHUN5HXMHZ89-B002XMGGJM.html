But not only does he plan to kill the criminals involved in a painful way, he plans to take out their attorney (Jamie Foxx), and everyone else with even the slightist involvement with the case. Simply arresting him seems an easy solution until we find out he was a government assassin with a pinchant for intricate deadly traps and he seems to have some means of controlling them from inside prison. Great action thriller with plenty of twists and turns. Good quality DVD with minor extras.

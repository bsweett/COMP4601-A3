This includes stand up routines, sitcoms with live studio audiences, or just your uncle Bob telling you a joke during a family visit.  Kung Fu Panda absolutely rules, and the animation is one of the main reasons why.<br /><br />I've actually wanted to watch Kung Fu Panda for quite a while now.  I finally got the chance to watch it this afternoon.  It certainly lived up to all the hype it received a couple years ago.<br /><br />What makes it so enjoyable is the fact that the laughs aren't the only exciting thing about Kung Fu Panda- it's the outrageous and zanny action segments that really elevate this film to a level of untouchable greatness.  We're talking a LOT of animated action here, folks.<br /><br />The storyline is about a panda bear that's severely out of shape but dreams about becoming the ultimate master of kung fu fighting.<br /><br />Eventually he's chosen to be given such a chance, with lots of special attention and guidance from his master (along with other friends).  Unfortunately his laziness constantly prevents him from ever reaching his dream... until a really evil wild cat comes into the equation and pretty much forces the panda bear to stand up and fight.<br /><br />I don't know what's most awesome about Kung Fu Panda- the exciting action and fighting segments, the actual humor and jokes involving all the animated animals communicating with each other, or just the brilliantly executed animation frames themselves.<br /><br />One thing's for sure- you simply MUST watch this movie.  Adults and children alike must watch it.  You'll be laughing hard and heavy, I guarantee it!</p></body></html>

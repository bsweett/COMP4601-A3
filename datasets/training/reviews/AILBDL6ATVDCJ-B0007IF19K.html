<meta name="summary" content="A Movie That Had To Be Made!"></head><body><p>Just about everything about in this movie was impressive.  From scanning side-to-side film shots (camera sliding left and right between actors speaking) to an amazing script, this movie lived up to the hype.<br /><br />I have to admit that I knew very little about Ray Charles before watching this film.  But after viewing this movie I felt like I couldn't learn enough about the man.  He was as talented a musician as there ever was.  And this story on film does a great job of trying to give us a glimpse of the struggles and roadblocks, some of them self-induced, this man suffered through.<br /><br />There are so many good parts in the movie that it would be impossible to list them all; besides, I don't want to spoil it for the five or six people who might not have watched the movie yet.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx manages to portray Ray Charles with such a convincing performance that he deserves all the accolades being sent his way.  He, in fact, is so convincing that at times I wanted to look away during the scenes when Ray was becoming addicted to drugs.  It will be extremely hard for Foxx to ever top this performance.<br /><br />The flashback scenes to Ray's childhood home and surroundings were inserted at just the right times during the film; I have seen directors totally blow that placement in movies.  Taylor Hackford should get director of the year for this movie.  He managed to add just the right amount of music, history, good dialogue, and extras to make this film a complete success.  I would love for him to direct The Running Girl if it ever becomes a movie; wishful thinking on my part.  Seriously, he is going to have a hard time topping this masterpiece.<br /><br />All of the actors and actresses in this movie were very convincing in their roles.  Combine that fact with the incredible set designs and atmosphere and you have a film that will still be popular fifty years from now.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie because you thought the hype was probably overdone, I suggest you take a look.  It really is that good.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></body></html>

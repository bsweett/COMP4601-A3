Part of the problem most big-ticket movies have had in the last several years is that they have been pretentious on the surface and hollow at the core.  "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is just big, supremely dumb, and gobs of fun.<br /><br />If you've seen the previews you know the basic story.  A married couple has settled into bland co-existence, each unaware that the other is a top-flight assassin.  When the two of them are given the same assignment and botch each other's plans, they are forced to train their sights on each other.<br /><br />That's it.  There are no layers, no profound themes.  Though a serious critic could get a great deal out of the fight scenes, which transparently conflate sex and violence, that's all smoke and mirrors.  This movie is about lush visuals, gorgeously choreographed combat, and coarse humor.<br /><br />It's true that the two leads don't put a lot into the acting.  Did you expect anything more from these two?  They deliver servicable lines and allow the camera to admire their stylish fighting technique.  That's all the movie demands, and that's all you and I need.<br /><br />It's not world-changing.  You won't tell your grandchildren about this movie in your glory days.  This is a movie to watch with hot buttered popcorn, a soda, and your sweetie.  It's plain the moviemakers had plenty of fun themselves, so kick back and enjoy.</p></body></html>

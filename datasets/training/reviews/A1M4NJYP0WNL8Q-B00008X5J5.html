There I was sitting way up front eating my popcorn and all of a sudden this spectacular dragon materialized right before my eyes.  Popcorn forgotten, I was hooked.  Cartoons never looked the same to me, and I spent the rest of my life inhaling fantasy and science fiction on a quest for the same thrill.<p>Animation has changed quite a bit in the ensuing years, but even today Sleeping Beauty is a towering achievement.  Now I'm more sensitive to the tricks of the art and can see the masterful use of perspective that made the scenes leap out at you.  When I first picked up this DVD I half expected to be disappointed, to find it really wasn't so glorious in retrospect.  This is hardly the case - this film is just as vibrant and alive as it was in 1959.<p>The added dimension now is that I can see how Disney's work was a formative influence on animation even today.  Artist/Directors like Miyazaki owe much to this film and its predecessor Snow White.  And they freely admit it.  As a production, Sleeping Beauty created a sense of legitimacy for animation that proved that high quality animation was something well beyond the Saturday morning funnies.<p>Disney took a great risk when creating this film, pouring a tremendous amount of resources in making it something as perfect as was possible for his time.  While the studio reaped the financial benefits, the audience was the real winner, as a whole genre exploded before our eyes.  Even now, with anime rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, this film stands out for story, art, and music.<p>The additional features, especially those that retell the making of the film, are excellent as well.  All captures in fine detail on this DVD.  This is a must see for anyone who still loves a fairy tale.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="If you like other Wes Anderson films, the this is right up your alley!"></head><body><p>The latest from Wes Anderson, using a lot of the same troupe as usual (Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, etc.) Light but fun movie about three estranged brothers who are called together by the oldest after he has a bike accident (and the an epiphany). They set off in India on a train ride to find their inner spirits. These comedies are more chuckles than belly laughs, but they come often and are nicely quirky. If you like Wes's previous movies ('Royal Tannenbaums', 'Life Aquatic', etc.), then this is right up your alley.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Best Picture of 2007"></head><body><p>After seeing it a second time, I think that ATONEMENT should have won the Academy Award as Best Picture of 2007.  It is a rich, sweeping production; a touching romantic drama that transports you back to a simpler, albeit more dangerous, time and place.<br /><br />There is also a surprise, absolutely unforgettable ending.<br /><br />Ian McEwan's acclaimed novel was adapted to the screen by Christopher Hampton and directed by Joe Wright.<br /><br />Keira Knightley and James McAvoy play the star-crossed lovers whose lives are destroyed by a vicious lie told by her younger sister, played at different times on the picture by Oscar-nominated Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave.<br /><br />With a great film, like ATONEMENT, you see many things in a second viewing that you missed the first time around.  For example, the occasional sound of a typewriter on the soundtrack takes on an entirely new meaning, as does a brief scene of McAvoy walking through a field of poppies.<br /><br />There is also a 5-minute stedicam sequence on the beach at Dunkirk that makes Orson Welles' brilliant opening sequence in TOUCH OF EVIL look like child's play.<br /><br />The DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment contains two excellent "Making of" featurettes, deleted scenes and audio commentary by director Wright.<br /><br />?

The plot is preposterous, but it is executed with 21st Century technical expertise.  Therefore, the viewer is so engaged with the visual extravaganza, he does not care that Tom Cruise essentially is impersonating Arnold's Terminator.  Cruise is a short man. The idea that he's a cool killer for some reason made me notice his eternal adolescent size.  In Easy Money he became the Cool Tom we see in Rain Man, Mission Impossible etc, but with gray hair, he resembles Tom with gray hair.  The kid doesn't have a lot of range, but Clark Gable didn't either.<br /><br />The big surprise in Collateral is Jamie Foxx.  I have no idea how these comedians turned sitcom boobs can suddenly out act Tom Cruise.  Again, I'm not sure this is a big deal, but Jamie does steal the show.  He's a nice guy stuck in a bad job with a talkie mother. His dreams are not realized because of his own inertia. The Cruise killer prods Jamie to aggressive actions he would have never taken without the threat of death.  Therefore his personality morphs, which is more than I can say for Cruise's character.<br /><br />LA at night is a strange alien city in Mann's vision.  Wandering the streets are the good and the bad in total isolation from each other.  Humans are but grains of sand on a universal beach according to Cruise.  Their elimination is meaningless.  From the rooftops LA is beautiful but meaningless.  Our lives are absurd in an Existential Philosophy without redemption.  I protest, but that's the post-Hitchcock vision of so many films today.</p></body></html>

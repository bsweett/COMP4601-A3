To be around such a weird and fearful person in charge of children made me very glad I'm not a Catholic and never went to a Catholic school. I had a few mean teachers in my time, but never anything like her. Streep played the part perfectly for one of those overly fanatic religious people who think they know it all.  But the whole theme of the film, the suspicion, the cruelty, of a teacher whose in charge of children, upset me so much, I had to finally turn it off.<br /><br />After a while, I turned it back on.  It was still playing, and it was near the end.  Then I saw that cruel nun crying because of the fact that she might have been wrong by trying to ruin a priests career, and who knows about the boy? That part was totally unbelievable.  In reality, she would have been proud of what she had done, as most fanatics are when things go their way. It made me so mad, that I threw the film in the garbage where it belonged.<br /><br />First of all the movie was supposed to be in the early 60's where no one ever would have accused a priest of pedophilia!  Out of the question.  This never came up until the 90's when a few brave boys spoke up.  And even then, it took years for anyone to believe them, or the church to do anything about it, much less the civil authorities.  Rev. Law of Boston, who covered up the crimes of his pedophile priests holds a high position in Rome today.  The Church didn't care one wit. And they still don't or Law would have been excommunicated, and sitting in a jail cell in Boston along with those priests he was protecting.<br /><br />I have no sympathy for a paranoid teacher whose in charge of children.  She should not have been placed in a school. She belonged in a mental institution. Beyond that, the priest did absolutely nothing to even cause any such doubt.  Should any nice priest or the kind father of a child be considered a molester?  I think a man would go out of his way to not act suspicious.  Rather this priest was simply being nice and helpful to a kid who felt out of his place.  I guess nice priests are not acceptable in the Catholic church.  But wasn't it Jesus who said "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven." Perhaps the Catholic Church doesnt' accept Jesus' beliefs just the Church's beliefs. Certainly this nun didn't. A priest can be kind without being a pedophile. And a difficult priest can, in fact, be one.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is a great actress and played the part of the evil, destructive nun to a T. One of her best acting jobs since Sophie's Choice.  But I hated the film, and I'm sorry she played that role.</p></body></html>

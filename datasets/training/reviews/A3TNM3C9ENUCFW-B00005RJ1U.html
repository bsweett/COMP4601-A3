<meta name="summary" content="Great Suspense and a Good Storyline"></head><body><p>This is actually a well plotted above average teen horror flick from director Victor Salva(most recently seen in the drama film Powder)<br />The first 20 minutes or so of this movie are truly tense and quite scary as we find a young brother &amp; sister travelling home for spring break in an old car. As they drive along in a more than deserted part of the countryside, they witness a macabre looking stranger doing something they can't quite believe after a near miss on the highway, and quickly begin to fear for their own safety. Without divulging too much of the storyline, the picture gathers pace from this point and more than cleverly keeps up the tension without falling into the usual gratuitous gore or fantastical scenes. Fans of this type of movie will certainly find plenty to enjoy, although the power of the movie is placed much more firmly in the psychological aspect, than the more common &quot;in your face&quot; horror, in fact there are even one or two references to the horror movie genre by the stars themselves, woven nicely into the script. The two main characters are played with huge credibility by the relative newcomers Gina Phillips and Justin Long, who are probably remembered for their recent outings in films like of Telling You &amp;  the very different Galaxy Quest respectively. Their portrayal of two very scared youngsters comes across well, and puts the viewer, easily into their situations. My only complaint about the movie would be the directors insistence on incorporating a fantastic element eventually into the direction, in an attempt to follow a supernatural theme. This works OK, but one has to say or more believable or credible explanation of the events we are seeing, would have been even better.<br />The movie has something of a low budget feel, but this is not in any way detrimental to the story, and almost adds something to the feeling of isolation in the locations depicted. All this said, this is a very well made movie with more than a few suprises along the way, and an ending that is certainly not &quot;out of the box&quot;. There are several short scenes of gory violence, but not too much to warrant an R rating otherwise. Enjoy.</p></body></html>

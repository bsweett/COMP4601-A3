<meta name="summary" content="Romero set the stage for today's horror  flick !"></head><body><p>I remember seeing this movie in theaters when I was a kid, and it still affects me the same today as it did back then.<br />If not for Romero, Horror movies would not be what they are today.<br />"Night of the Living Dead" was the true grounbreaker in horror,<br />but "Dawn" actually paved the way for today's horror flick.<br />It was the blood and guts and gore, and all in wonderful technicolor!!!!<br />True enough, there are cheesy looking things in the movie, like the blood in some scenes looks UNMISTAKENLY like red paint,<br />But if you focus on the STORY and not it's minor defects, It is one hell of a movie!<br /><br />To me there is nothing scarier than the walking dead! I also loved the idea (and still do today) of the survivors living upstairs in this HUGE mall,in very nice living quarters, and everything they could possibly want or need in the mall below, right at thier fingertips!<br />  then the irony that without a civilization of people, all these material things, and money are......useless !!<br /><br />"Dawn of the Dead" is just a great horror flick, with a GREAT storyline, and in my opinion, the acting was good, too.<br />The movie surely is not boring as some have suggested, in fact, quite the contrary. It held my attention RAPTLY for the entire film. I only wish they would have made a part 2 to this with the same characters!<br />It would have been nice to see what became of Fran and Peter,Fran's baby...They could have easily did a part 2, The possibilities were endless!<br />Perhaps the NEW version of "Dawn" they will make a part 2...I REALLY wasn't satisfied with THAT ending!!!<br />Anyway, I am getting way off track here, I give "Dawn" 10 stars!!!!</p></body></html>

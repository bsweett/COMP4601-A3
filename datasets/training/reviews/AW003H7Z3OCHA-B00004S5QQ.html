<meta name="summary" content="AFI Voted Casablanca #2 ALL TIME CLASSIC !!!!"></head><body><p>Casablanca is the 2nd greatest movie of the 100 top  in the last 100 years according to the American Film Institute (AFI) poll of 1998.<p>Warner Brothers Studios produce an abundance of hit patriotic romance features during the War Years (1940's).  They had a stable of the greatest stars (Bogart, Bergman, Rains, Lorre, Greenstreet to mention a few) which produced countless movies in short order.<p>In Summary; French Morocco during World War II love triangle night club owner Rick (Humphrey Bogart), Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) &amp; Victor (Paul Henreid) try to outwit &amp; escape the Nazi's with many twists &amp; turns involving an assortment of memorable characters you'll never forget.<p>Casablanca was the greatest of Warner Brothers (Best Picture Oscar)1940's features.  In my opinion the #1 movie as yet due to the fantasic script, sreenplay (Won an Oscar) plots, cast, direction (Best Director Oscar)and charismatic attraction you'll have in watching this movie over and over.<p>The extras include a fantastic documentary narrated by Bogarts wife, Lauren Bacall.<p>Seeing is believing, trust me, pull up a comfortable chair and watch this digitalized Black &amp; White classic &quot;CASABLANCA&quot;.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ONLY Will Ferrell movie I like"></head><body><p>I had caught this film on pay cable when it came on in 2005.<br /><br />Surprised me I liked it.<br /><br />At the time of release, it was original idea for a film I thought.<br /><br />It is the ONLY Will Ferrell film I like where he is the lead character.<br /><br />Now of course EVERY ear he does a similar film like all the sports films basketball, NASCAR & ice skating where this good Anchorman idea keeps being repeated.<br /><br />The cast were perfect in their roles.  Did NOT need Luke Wilson though.  Unnecessary.  And, I do NOT like the Wilson brothers.<br /><br />Now, the DVD package it's.<br /><br />I expected more since it is a "Unrated, Uncut, & Uncalled For!".<br />1.  Has those HORRIBLE little flaps tat are a pain & terrible to have to open up.<br />2.  NO chapter search list or any information on the film inside.<br /><br />Good soundtrack for the film</p></body></html>

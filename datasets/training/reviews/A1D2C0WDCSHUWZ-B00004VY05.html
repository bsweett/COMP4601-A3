<meta name="summary" content="Dumb but entertaining..."></head><body><p>"The Fifth Element" has so many illogical plot holes that eventually your brain stops noticing them. It'sd a dumb scifi epic that knows how dumb it is, and as a result it doesn't take itself seriously. With some good acting, bad acting, and a lot of bright colors, this is an entertaining way to spend a weekend evening.<p>In 1914, in anticipation of war the alien Mondoshawi took four mystical stones from Earth. The four stones represent the four elements, and when centered around the perfect being (the Fifth Element) they become a weapon against the forces of darkness and evil, who show up every five thousand years. (No, don't ask why!) Their contact is always a priest of indeterminate religion, who has been given the "knowledge" from his predecessors. Three hundred years later, a dark planetoid is zooming toward Earth, increasing in size and swallowing warships. When the Mondoshawi attempt to return the stones to Earth, they're blown up by the thugs of Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman). Isn't that a great name?<p>All that's left is the hand of the Fifth Element, which the president's scientists clone into a beautiful young woman (Milla Jovovich) who speaks the "Divine Language" only. But the Fifth Element -- nicknamed Leeloo -- escapes and falls into the cab of a bitter-with-a-heart-of-gold ex-military cabbie, Corbin Dallas (Bruce Willis). He takes her to the priest who is supposed to help her, Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm). The problem is, the Evil will be there in a few days, and the stones are missing. With the help of Cornelius, Leeloo, and the unspeakably annoying Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker), Dallas must stop the powers of darkness from destroying the universe. (I can't believe I just wrote that)<p>You can tell this is an unusual film just by the colors -- French director Luc Besson revels in bright blues and reds and yellows. And what other movie would have opera singing during a martial-arts sequence? It's a quirky vision of the future, with New York much as it is now (noisy, crowded, full of bad drivers in aircars), McDonald's, otherwordly resorts, annoying radio talk show hosts, and a little box that applies your makeup for you. (I want one of those) <p>Bruce Willis is okay as Corbin Dallas. Not great, not bad, just okay. He does have some really sparkling moments, such as when Corbin is at the opera, or when he describes Leeloo to a friend, but most of the time he seems very "Die Hard." Milla Jovovich uses her expressive face, eyes and body to best effect, especially since Leeloo speaks gibberish most of the time. (Her wild flailing when Leeloo is in the cloning tube is amazing, like a trapped animal) And she seems a lot like a baby in an adult body sometimes, repeating "autowash" and "multipass" and giggling with delight over chicken dinners. Ian Holm is, as always, wonderful as the kindly little priest, who manages to remain semi-dignified under very circumstances. He's cute. Gary Oldman revels weirdly in his role as the ultra-evil-for-no-reason Zorg. And Chris Tucker wins the prize for most annoying supporting character: An effeminate, loud, obnoxious, pointless-in-the-plot radio talk show host who will drive many viewers up the wall. (At least the hero despises him)<p>The dialogue ranges from very funny ("Too bad it's not loaded") to very, very corny ("We are lost!"); the soundtrack is very good as well, ranging from opera to pop. There's some sexual content (very weird and not at all sexy) and some nudity (brief and vague), nd not a lot of cursing. And in the age of CGI, it's nice to see that there are still movies that are unafraid to stick rather silly rubber masks on the actors. (The masks do, admittedly, fit the movie -- the special effects are less prominent than you'd expect)<p>Basically, "Fifth Element" is a good movie for when you don't want to use your brain. With the good (Holm and Jovovich) the bad (Tucker) and the REALLY ugly (all of Rhod's clothes, and the Mangalore thugs), it's entertaining if flawed brain fluff.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Christmas chick flick"></head><body><p>The story's predictable.  Two women, burned in their respective relationships, decide to change countries and homes for a holiday break.  Both fall in love with local gents.<br /><br />Amanda (Diaz) is a California television producer who's got no spark with her live-in boyfriend.  She throws him out when she learns he was cheating on her and she still cannot cry.<br /><br />Iris (Winslet) is an English editor who's been involved with Jasper (Rufus Sewell) who can't seem to let her go, but is going to marry someone else.<br /><br />And yet, both acting and some twists in the plot made this a film I'll buy and watch again.  One of the particular treats is Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach) appears in California as an aging writer who needs help from Iris to get some of his 'gumption' back.<br /><br />The soundtrack is also lovely.  I particularly enjoyed some of the instrumental pieces.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, December 2008</p></body></html>

I figured I'd at least get a nice, lowbrow, politically incorrect goofball comedy with a few good laughs in the mold of Old School and Anchorman, but instead Wedding Crashers turned out to be the kind of cynical, implausible, and overlong dead whale of a movie that's causing ever-greater dissatisfaction with Hollywood.  Padded out to a laughable running time of 119 minutes, this movie can't even be saved by the deliriously cute Rachel McAdams, which is saying something.  Obviously Wedding Crashers was designed to be a classic buddy comedy, but it only deserves that label if you think Black Sheep does as well.<br /><br />The movie starts out promisingly enough, as we see a pair of thirty-something divorce mediators (I think it says something that I don't even remember their names at this point) devoting their midyear weekends to going uninvited to weddings of various religions and ethnicities to pick up chicks, culminating in a few good lines and some nice gratuitious nudity.  It's all downhill from there, though, as a clever concept is ruined by humor that would cease to exist if it were any broader or more watered down.  There are a few good ideas to be found in the first half of the movie, notably with some of the ancillary characters: the crazed clingy girl, the evil alpha-male boyfriend, and the social-misfit brother all manage to provoke a few guffaws.  Ultimately, though, Wedding Crashers turns out to be some decent ideas in search of a movie.  Great comedies-Rushmore, Election, The Big Lebwoski, Swingers-have memorable main characters, interesting plots, and intelligent dialogue.  Weighed down by sitcom-level writing and a mailed-in lead performance by the talented Owen Wilson (Vince Vaughn isn't much better), Wedding Crashers boasts none of these things.<br /><br />Even worse, about halfway through, after a cryptic conversation between Vaughn and the underused Christopher Walken and an agonizing beach pattycake scene, the movie sells out and ventures into sappy relationship territory, turning into the most ghastly of all creations: a romantic comedy without the comedy.  Even the inevitable Will Ferrell cameo near the end isn't enough to redeem Wedding Crashers from the horrors witnessed in its final hour.  This movie was clearly trying to be all things to all people, making it sort of the cinematic equivalent of a John Mayer album: soulless, corporate, and irritatingly ingratiating.  Had the makers of the film decided to go lowbrow and stay there they might have had something, but in the end all we're left with is yet another piece of big-studio tripe to rival anything Julia Roberts has starred in.</p></body></html>

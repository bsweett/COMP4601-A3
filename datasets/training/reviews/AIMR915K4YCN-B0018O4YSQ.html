Why can't he remember? Why can't he recall his own name? Did he kill the girl? John has no idea. You see, he was destined for a completely different reality than the one he's awakened to / in. Mr. Murdoch was supposed to be a serial killer. He somehow resisted this fate and must now find out who he really is. Along the way he meets THE STRANGERS, an odd group of humanoids, led by Mr. Hand (Richard &quot;Riff Raff&quot; O'Brien). These scary folks seem bent on Murdoch's destruction. They control everything, making the entire city sleep, so they can rearrange buildings, erect whole new cityscapes, and inject whole new lifetime &quot;memories&quot; / &quot;experiences&quot; into the minds of their subjects (the populace). John soon finds that he can manipulate things with his mind and battle the strangers on an equal footing. Helped by a police detective (William Hurt) and John's &quot;wife&quot; (Jennifer Connelly), Murdoch sets out to discover the secret truth behind the artificial world he's trapped in. Kieffer Sutherland plays a psychiatrist who may or may not be trying to help John Murdoch. The ending is positive without being sappy. DC is sort of a good cross between THE MATRIX, BLADE RUNNER, THE TRUMAN SHOW, METROPOLIS, and THE TRIAL, among others. Would make a mind-blowing double bill w/ MEMENTO! Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

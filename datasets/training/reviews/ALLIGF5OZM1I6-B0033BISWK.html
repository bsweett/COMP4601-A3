It's no surprise his film found its place among the top ten nominated for the Academy Award for best picture.<br /><br />It starts off slow and is shot kind of like a documentary. I'll admit, the beginning of the film could have been done a little better, but it does serve a purpose. It sets up the characters and the film's thick underlying theme; which is prejudice and segregation.<br /><br />We learn that in the 80s, an alien spices landed on Earth. Not in Manhattan or Los Angeles, but in Johannesburg, South Africa.<br /><br />The alien's massive `mother ship' still hovers above the city, years after they landed. The special effects used for this little trick are flawless. Seeing as two of my picks for best special effects didn't receive nominations (2012 and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen), it's between District 9 and Avatar for the Oscar. If you think the spaceship looks cool, just wait till you see the creatures.<br /><br />They reminded me of a cross between The Fly and Predator. Because of this, they are referred to as the slur name `prawns.' After the humans become agitated by their presence (some twenty years later) they put forth an effort to have them sanctioned off, into a lower-status-quo part of town referred to as `District 9'. Should they refuse, they are terminated.<br /><br />Our hero is Wickus, played by a newbie by the name of Sharlto Copley. You can expect to see a lot more of this guy, because he was brilliant. Matter of fact, he's already going to be starring opposite Liam Neeson, Jessica Biel and Bradley Cooper in the upcoming action flick, The A-Team.<br /><br />It's no wonder Sharlto was interested in the material, as he was born a native of Johannesburg. Add on the fact that the film was produced by Peter Jackson, and he seems like a pretty smart dude to me.<br /><br />As the film is filled with intense action sequences and grizzly alien images, I'm sure a great number of its viewers will miss these important political analogies all together. If we are lucky, maybe they'll listen to the audio commentary.</p></body></html>

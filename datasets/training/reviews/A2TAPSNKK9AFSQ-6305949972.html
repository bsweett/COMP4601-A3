<meta name="summary" content="Another Masterpiece By Tim Burton!!!"></head><body><p>I have nothing but admiration for the talented and VERY PATIENT guys who endevour to make a movie based on stop/start photography. This must truly be a "labour of love" and the results of their efforts are wondrous. The viewer is introduced to Jack Skellington who is the King Of Halloween but has become jaded with this annual event. There must be millions of guys out in tedious jobs who can relate to Jack's predicament. Then to Jacks great surprise and delight he discovers "Christmastown" where everything is shiny and beautiful. So Jack then kidnaps Santa Claus in the hope of reproducing a wonderful Christmas for all. I marvel at  the novel concept of this movie in a time where most producers are just making stupid "Teenage Sex Comedies' which feature male virgins and of course the obligatory prostitute. This movie is a gem for young and old and I also have got to mention Jack's long suffering girfriend who also springs to vivid life in this movie. Tim Burton Rocks!!!</p></body></html>

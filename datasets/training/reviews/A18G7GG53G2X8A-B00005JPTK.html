This plot device is used once again in "I Am Legend," a science fiction thriller that would be far less impressive if an epidemic was all that the plot had to go on. In all honesty, the plot isn't all that interesting or original; this is the fourth film adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel, the first three being 1964's "The Last Man on Earth," 1971's "The Omega Man," and 2007's direct to video "I Am Omega." For this newest adaptation, the casting of Will Smith is what made it work, especially since he had to act by himself for most of the film. He plays an intelligent, driven, and desperate character, a man whose isolating circumstances have driven him to emotional extremes. Some extremes almost come off as funny, in a pathetic sort of way.<br /><br />Yes, I can praise Smith a great deal for this role. The story, on the other hand, is generally entertaining but not entirely successful, especially as it nears the end; at that point, it relies too much on the clich&eacute;s of hope, loss, and redemption in the midst of frightening special effects. This isn't to say that the film doesn't work altogether--the first three-quarters of "I Am Legend" are surprisingly strong, not only because of Smith's performance, but also because of the way it builds tension. The story functions under the premise of a cure for cancer that was introduced in 2009, only to mutate into an infection. By the year 2012, ninety percent of the planet's population is dead. Of the remaining ten percent, less than one percent is immune to the virus--everyone else has been transformed into a vampire-like flesh eater. Nothing is ever mentioned about garlic or wooden stakes, but it is known that exposure to sunlight is fatal for these things.<br /><br />This is the horrible future in which we find Robert Neville (Smith), a sole-surviving military scientist who struggles to exist in an empty, decimated New York City. When he's not gathering basic supplies, hunting loose herds of deer with his beloved dog, Sam, or protecting himself from hordes of mutant vampires, he's trying to discover a cure in a makeshift lab in his basement. Because he's immune, his blood serves as a possible way to produce a cure. The ironic implications of that are too clever to overlook: Blood may in fact be the key to ridding the infected of their thirst for blood. But irony is not what this film is about; at its heart, "I Am Legend" is about loneliness, guilt, and paranoia, all of which come into perspective during flashback sequences involving Neville and his family. Piece by piece, the fates of his wife, Zoe (Salli Richardson), and daughter, Marley (Willow Smith), are revealed, as are the facts of how Manhattan Island was quarantined.<br /><br />Neville's memories are second only to his emotional well-being, which is barely hanging on by a thread. He tries to maintain his sanity by (1) keeping a video diary of his scientific research, and (2) sending out a radio message to anyone who might be alive and in need of shelter. But his sanity may be slipping. Early on, he enters a video store that not only has a fine selection of DVDs, but also a number of strategically placed mannequins. He speaks to them as if they were real people. He also avoids some out of nervousness; he just can't bring himself to strike up a conversation with the pretty female mannequin in back of the store. Here's a scene that appears light-hearted and funny but is actually quite serious. Simply put, loneliness can make a person do some strange things. And consider the moment he returns to the video store--he finally does approach the female mannequin to say, "I promised my friend I'd say hello to you. Hello." Now with tears in his eyes, he says, "Please say hello to me. Please. Say hello to me."<br /><br />This is the kind of depth that can mean the difference between a compelling film and an unimaginative rehash. Most of "I Am Legend" is a well-structured character study, highlighted by palpable levels of suspense, drama, and fright. It isn't until the final twenty minutes that the film loses some steam, turning a fascinating story into a run of the mill creature feature. It begins with the introduction of two immune humans: a young woman named Anna (Alice Braga) and a boy named Ethan (Charlie Tahan). Anna believes that a survivor's colony exists, not because she's actually seen it, but because God told her so. This, of course, brings out the worst in Neville, who has not only lost his faith, but also his willingness to leave New York--"This is Ground Zero," he says. "I can fix this." Despite his daily radio message, his years of isolation have left him unable to interact with other people, least of all with Anna.<br /><br />And that's when the vampire mutants attack, infiltrating Neville's fortress/house in a final showdown. I obviously can't say how everything ends, but I can say that it isn't all that surprising given the kind of movie this wants to be. I won't go so far as to say that the ending doesn't work, but I do think it could have worked better, especially since the rest of the film was so much more effective. For the most part, "I Am Legend" is an above average thriller, with a tense opening that quietly plays itself out. I'm recommending this movie despite some structural and narrative flaws; on the whole, it's still an engaging, taut, emotionally charged thriller, one of the better ones of recent memory.</p></body></html>

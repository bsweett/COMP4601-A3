Granted, he brings many of the memorable traits of other films into each of his performances, but he's never boring. Depp is the main reason to see SECRET WINDOW. He plays writer Mort Raney, a somewhat successful author, who is going through the pains of an impending divorce. One day, a stranger knocks at his door and accuses Mort of stealing his short story, &quot;Secret Window.&quot; What a strange man...in a Quakerish style hat, with a rich Southern drawl, and cold, clinical eyes. John Turturro is wonderful in this role, bringing an inevitable demonic presence into Depp's tortured life.<br /><br /> Although the outcome may be apparent, it doesn't really hit you until the director David Koepp wants it to. Depp's performance is great, including his habit of cracking his jaws whenever things get a little nervous. Maria Bello and Timoth Hutton as his estranged wife and her lover perform adequately, but they are really more plot tools than characters. Charles Dutton, likewise, isn't given a whole lot to do, but his presence is commanding. Veteran character actor Len Cariou is also good in his role as the local sheriff.<br /><br /> SECRET WINDOW is a quietly suspenseful movie; it's not really a &quot;scary&quot; movie, but more of an intense portrayal of a man's descent into madness. Depp was perfect for the role.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Lesson for Us All!"></head><body><p>This movie rocked the nation when it came out. It's the film that put Edward Norton(Incredible Hulk, The 25th Hour, The Score) on the radar.<br /><br />The movie is a statement about racism, family and hate. Anyone that has seen this movie, can relate in one way or another. It makes you think about what you've done, what you've said and where that hate comes from. Everyone can take something away from this film, some lesson, some meaning.<br /><br />Ed Norton plays a racist, he goes to prison and when he gets out, his younger brother Edward Furlong (Terminator 2, Brainscan, Jimmy and Judy) is just like him. A racist full of unbridled hate for no good reason. Norton is healed, no longer a racist, matured and past that stage of his life, he tries to get his brother help and the movie escalates from there, twisting and turning, until the dramatic climax.<br /><br />A classic, everyone should see this movie!</p></body></html>

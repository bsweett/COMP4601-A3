He plays Robert Langdon, a guy with a fictional degree in cryptology who can suddenly turn into a super athletic hero type when called upon.  Jesus had a cousin whose sister had a nephew who married a truck driver that had another boy whose daughter married a guy a while back and now they live in Memphis.  In the meantime of course, it is all laid out in a painting until they find this Rubiks cube device that would make the people at Monopoly laugh.  Tom Hanks with long hair is lame as well, so beware of long haired crypto guys that suddenly can dodge bullets!</p></body></html>

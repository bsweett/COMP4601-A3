This is a Hollywood rags to riches tale based on a true story, but there are some liberties taken with the truth here. All in all it's still a wonderful film.<br /><br />I have nothing against 'Rocky', but this film is in another class. Heartfelt, inspirational and an eternal classic! Paul Giamatti gives a fantastic(should have won an Oscar!)performance as Braddock's manager. This is one of Ron Howards best films, if not the best picture he has ever made.<br /><br />If I have one complaint with the film, it is that the audio is too extreme between the boxing scenes and the talking scenes. I found myself adjusting the volume constantly either because I could not hear what was being said in the talking scenes or having my ears explode when they went to the fight scenes!....too bad.<br /><br />One of the best pictures I have seen in many years! The DVD has a great transfer and should be in everyone's movie collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I was so ...INCREDIBLY...unprepared"></head><body><p>I admit that I was not attracted to this motion picture. I had no desire to watch it. Then my 6 year old asked if we could buy it on pay per view. And what is my opinion now that I've seen it? I love it! In fact, I would watch it again and again. It exceeded expectations. Mr. Incredible was hilarious.<br /><br />The Incredibles is a movie about a super hero that is forced into retirement but, alas, his heart is still with saving the world from danger. He heads to the suburbs where he takes a lame desk job (like the one I have). Occasionally he sneaks out to rescue someone from a fire, etc, but he does it behind his wife's back.<br /><br />Along the way Mr. Incredible has 3 incredible children who, of course, all have unique superpowers. Mr. Incredible inevitably gets drawn into peril, gets a new hero suit, and goes off to save the world against a very evil villain. (I won't spoil you with clues as to who it is). Mr. Incredible's family joins him in this adventure, and the world is restored to happiness.<br /><br />The Incredibles is a movie for all ages. The humor is actually humorous, and I found myself laughing out loud many times. The Incredibles are not crude or obnoxious other than the kids having an occasional verbal scuffle. In general the movie is immersive, flows very well, and makes 90 minutes seem like 30.</p></body></html>

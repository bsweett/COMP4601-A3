<meta name="summary" content="Good but not scary"></head><body><p>Is there a law against making horror movies scary? This movie seems like just an excuse for Ryan Reynolds to take his shirt off. I never saw the original Amityville but I did see the Simpsons Halloween special where they spoofed it. And that was a lot better than this movie. It just wasn't scary. In fact, the parts that are supposed to be scary are kinda funny. Like when they go down in the basement and there are coffins there with their names on them. That made me laugh. I dunno. This isn't a terrible movie. Good for a night when you have nothing to do.</p></body></html>

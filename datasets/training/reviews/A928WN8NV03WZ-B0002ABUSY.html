<meta name="summary" content="All I ever wanted in a horror movie"></head><body><p>Well maybe not everything, but it was one of the best horror movies of late, as well as one of the best horror remakes.  Psycho fell a bit flat, not bad, but nothing special.  Texas Chainsaw Massacre was argued over many about how terrifying it was.  This one was a truly scary movie, dealing with several common fears; death, especially when they rise to consume the living, and the fear of disease.  It also deals with some more psychological ideals, as in how would survivors deal with what appears to be the end of the world.<br /><br />The movie starts out simply enough, teasing you with ideas of what was going to happen.  Ana (Sarah Polley) is working late on her shift as a nurse.  There is mentioned that someone was brought in for a bite on the hand and the ambulances tear off before she leaves.  She and her husband are obviously very in love, and while taking a shower miss an emergency broadcast on the TV.  A little girl who seems injured wakes them from their slumber, but then savagely attacks and kills her husband like a feral animal.  While she is calling an EMT her husband dies, gets up, and starts attacking her in the same manner.  She manages to get to her car and escape out of her neighborhood.  But disaster is all around her, packs of people screaming wildly are running through the burbs, cars are racing through the streets crashing more often than not, etc......  She crashes after someone tries to take her car, and after waking up meets Kenneth(Ving Rhames) and another group of people looking for safety.  They go to the mall and board it up with a group of rednecks they found and other survivors and try to figure what to do next.<br /><br />The first 10 minutes of this movie are just about perfect.  It was teasing with the horror, bringing up the tension until we finally see what we paid to see.  Then it goes full tilt until the car crash and the opening credits.  They show tidbits of what is going on through news pieces, and without telling you make it seem like society is collapsing, and now people are more concerned with survival than anything.  The zombies aren't slow moving ponderous(a fact that was argued over by horror fans), they are fast moving almost feral animals.  Society seems to rapidly collapse with extreme chaos, then the only thing that you see is the dead and the small group of survivors.  The survivors are what you would logically expect, a mixed up group of people; crazy rednecks, a yuppie, some kids, truckers, salesman, gangbanger, etc.....  They don't interact well, some of them are outright dangerous, and some are a little deranged.  They go from a point of fear to a point of decadence, society is gone so they can do pretty much whatever they want, no work, no bills, etc.....<br /><br />The bad<br />The acting was a bit lopsided, and though there were more people than in the original, they didn't go into a lot of them with any sort of depth making them feel a bit too dimensional.  They also didn't explore the world around them as much, making it feel more claustrophobic.<br /><br />The good<br />The movie has a fresh feeling to the pacing, starting out as an adrenaline shot then going to a psychological piece, to a survival at all costs ending.  The zombies are used well, never over done, or overused.  The makeup and FX are excellent, especially when you see the progression in one of the featurettes.  The plot was believable, and the character interactions interesting.  The extras were actually worthwhile, they took some effort in this.<br /><br />All in all this is an excellent horror movie, and one of the better zombie movies of all time.</p></body></html>

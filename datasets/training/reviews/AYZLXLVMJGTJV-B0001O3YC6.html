<meta name="summary" content="Space Odyssey"></head><body><p>Very Dark picture to match its title. A story of those in cybersleep who wake up to their ship going out of control. Rushing to controls, trying to save the sleeping fugitives who await unknown possibilities and adventures. Help they scream out as the ship plummets into outer space. They are saved I don't know who Owens is but he saved those passengers. They hit the new planet with flying blackish birds they could look like huge cormarants. They try and some do make it, rebuilding the exisiting dumping ground space machines with cells they find. The things I liked. I like the female lead, I think she is very pretty and strong looking, plus I think she is a good actress. She does a good job in all films she is in. I would like to look this strong. She is the captain and struggles to keep her plan. I like flying to space planets and meeting the strange creatures and exiciting possibilites. The birds dripped blue blood from the many sun filled atmosphere, an eclipse comes bringing them out of hiding to eat the stranded. Help again, finding a solution so they can move on to ever more feats of strength and hope of happiness in each of their neverending experiences.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well, if they free me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine,,,"></head><body><p>I'd bet i'd move it all a little farther down the line, far from Folsom Prison, thats where I want to stay.<br /><br />As I write this review I'm listening to Walk the Line soundtrack, Cocaine Blues, great song.  "I was dressed in black"  Sorry I'll try to refrain from writing any more song lines down.  Okay first of all, I think Joquin Phoenix is one of the best actors in this time.  I mean, I thought he was good in Gladiator and the Village, in this he should have got an Oscar.  Singing all of the songs and acting awesomely at the same time!  That deserves a ZOUNDS!<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon is very good too.  She doesn't sing as well as Joquin, but she still gives a great performance.  The movie chronicles his entire life from his rise to fame, to his struggle with drugs, to him rising up again.<br /><br />Overall watch this movie, it gave me a much better appreciation for Mr. Cash and his life.<br /><br />"You'll wake up some cold day and find your alone, you'll ask for me but I'm gonna tell you BYE BYE BYE, When I turn around and walk away your gonna CRY CRY CRY.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Poor attention to any detail"></head><body><p>The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy Mr. Neeson. The movie itself is absolutely absurd. "Mr. Outdoors", played by Neeson made every wrong decision starting with his employment at the oil camp.<br />So many dreadful errors in judgements made me want to turn the movie off, as did the stereotyping of the differing characters, especially the former prison inmate.<br />I wont get into why there were shotgun shells found but no shotgun or how Mr. Neesons rifle was broken while it's case remained intact.<br />I wont go into detail as to why on earth they ever left the relative safe haven they could have made the remnants of the crashed aircraft into while awaiting rescue (there are two black boxes on such aircraft, all of them, that transmit signalling information for a very long time).<br />I wont go into detail about why Mr Neeson didnt die of hypothermia after his little river excursion late in the movie.<br />And I won't express my disgust with the ending of the movie.<br />I would not recommend this movie to anyone other than President Obama as I don't hate anyone else enough.<br />Poor movie with a great actor in it. That is as kind as I can be.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Cast-Good Movie, BRING ON THE SEQUEL!"></head><body><p>The Italian Job brings to the screen the story of a group of thieves bent on revenge on one of their own who betrayed them by murdering their leader and running off with the gold.<br />Mark Wahlberg, Donald Sunderland, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Seth Green, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are commendable to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few laughs.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!<br />In short, The Italian Job is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Horror film that engages you in the characters and plot"></head><body><p>Let Me In deals with both one boy's need to find acceptance, friendship and love, but also the darkness surrounding vampirism. Owen is a young boy who feels a sense of alienation at home with his parents having marital problems. He is also is the target of bullies at schools. He internalizes ideas of revenge with his tormentors at times when alone. Drawn to his next door neighbor, Abby, he strikes up a friendship with her and they begin to pal around. It becomes clear to Owen that Abby is not like other children. She doesn't seem to have knowledge of simple everyday things, and is seemingly never around at school, which gives Owens clues that there is something shady about her. He also overhears what appears to be verbal abuse in her home next door. A string of bizarre murders leads one policeman to believe some cult is responsible. As Owen longs more and more for friendship, he gets closer and closer to Abby, even while he suspects she is in some way connected with the murders.<br /><br />A remake of the recent Swedish film Let the Right One In and based on the book by John Ajvide Lindqvist, Let Me In is a well-thought out, intelligent horror film that has the right balance of mood, plot and gore. Although it has elements of violence and gore, it doesn't overdo it to the point of making this the focus. There's a real understated quality to the film, especially the dialogue between Owen and Abby, but it works here because both characters are trying to channel acceptance from each other and understand their conflicted inner worlds. Both leads (Chloe Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee) are solid in their roles as the two friends.<br /><br />I haven't watched the original film yet, but looking forward to checking it out after seeing this. Unlike many horrors films of today, Let Me In actually makes you feel a little bit for the characters and engages you in their story.</p></body></html>

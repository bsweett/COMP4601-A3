<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood must have lost his marbles"></head><body><p>I cannot go into how many ways this films bothers me or I would be playing spoiler.  Oh, how I wished I had read the spoilers first!<p>It was tightly directed, though with a style and feel that echoed a much better film, A Perfect World.  But unlike A Perfect World, where the were good guys, bad buys and bad guys who had good in them, this film has no one that is likeable, no one you can respect.  Worse, it has no remorse, and that is SO sad, no redemption. <p>Bacon, Penn, and Robinson put in strong performances in their going nowhere roles.  I admired Eastwood's flair in A Perfect World, an emotional film that touched you on all levels.  Only this movie...well, you want to wash after watching it.  You cannot empathize with Penn's character, even though the murder of his 19-year-old daughter is the focal point of the film.  Sorry, to point all the problems of this film one would have to go into spoilers left and right (I wish someone had told me the spoilers before!).  There are devises that have no place in the film, that do nothing to further the storyline, just Eastwood's sense of quirky?  Quirky worked in A Perfect World, quirky worked in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  Quirky in this films was an insult to the intelligence of the viewer.  I have loved Eastwood since his Rowdy Yates days, and marveled all the films he has starred in or directed ever since.  But this one just is so pointless.  This movie has a lack of honor, of true caring, of heart and it just hurts to see such talent put to such a useless waste of 2 ? hours.<p>My best advice - Rent this film before you buy or - be sure to read all the BAD reviews before making up your mind.  Most people will not enjoy the senseless violence and to no end.  Most people will not like the total remorse in nearly all the characters.</p></body></html>

She has a beauty and innocence that I find captivating. As Dahlia Williams, Ms. Connelly has this same charming quality, while going through a living hell. Dahlia is being assaulted on three separate levels. She is haunted by the terrible memories of her childhood, dogged by the insanity of her current, ugly divorce, and plagued by the ghostly happenings in her apartment building. Dahlia and her daughter, Cecelia are in the middle of a black storm of  overwhelming forces. A combination that would drive most souls to despair, most minds to break down. Watching this poor woman go through this ordeal is downright depressing, yet Connelly plays it w/ her usual grace. DARK WATER is a supernatural mystery. Beyond that, it is a story about the undying love of one mother for her daughter in the face of abandonment,  desolation, and mounting terror. I watched it twice, and liked it more the second time around...</p></body></html>

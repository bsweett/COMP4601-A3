<meta name="summary" content="WOW...I should have saw this one on the BIG screen!"></head><body><p>I bought this movie without ever seeing it and knowing that many critics had bashed this one pretty bad. Thanks to some of the amazon.com reviewers giving it 4 or 5 stars, I thought maybe it would be better than the critics thought and I knew it had to be much better than Daredevil. This movie is so much fun from start to finish! Way better than Daredevil or The Hulk and to me just as good as the first two Spiderman films. The action is good throughout without going too over the top and the creative kills were a nice touch to an already violent movie. Tom Jane nails the part of Frank Castle here and is a joy to behold as his character changes from family man to a one man assault team. I heard John Travolta went over the top here, but to me he plays a pretty laid back bad guy and I like what he did with this role. Yes, the neighbors are a little annoying (they were in the comics too), but there screen time is limited. The only character I really didn't was the model turned actress who played the third neighbor. She just couldn't act and got on my nerves fast. This is a must buy for all action and comic hero movie fans out there! This one will be watched many times in the coming weeks. High replay value = A worthy purchase.</p></body></html>

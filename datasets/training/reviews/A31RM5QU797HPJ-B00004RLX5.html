How do they save the world?  By bringing two humpback whales into the future to talk to a probe in space that is destorying the Earth.<br /><br />  This is my favorite "classic Trek" movies. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but that's what makes it enjoyable.  This also stars Catherine Hicks from "7th Heaven"</p></body></html>

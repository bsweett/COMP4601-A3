<meta name="summary" content=""Disobey and you die.""></head><body><p>Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) is an ordinary young man working at a copy center when he suddenly finds himself on the run from the FBI.  A woman's voice on the phone has him racing all over the place and facing death at every turn.  Running with him is a young mother (Michelle Monaghan) whose son will be killed if she and Jerry don't do what they're told.  They make their way to Washington, D.C. and finally find out who is controlling their every move.<br /><br />I've enjoyed Shia LaBeouf before and was expecting another movie showcasing his boyish charm.  Sadly, this film didn't give him a chance to really shine; it's just one frantic, chaotic, mad dash from place to place with a bunch of explosions and implausible escapes from death.  The intensity level is always at 99% which leaves no time to really get to know LaBeouf's character.  He's in a constant state of fear and we don't know why until the very end.  The voice on the phone telling Jerry what to do and where to go has the ability to control any and all machines and systems he comes in contact with; this starts out pretty preposterous and goes all the way to "Huh?!"<br /><br />None of the incredible, non-stop action scenes could really happen, but if you love explosions and don't need a story that makes sense, this is the movie for you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Enough"></head><body><p>I picked up this movie for my wife; figured it'd be a nice chick-flick and don't all girls like romance and fashion<br /><br />The Devil Wears Prada is about an aspiring journalist, Anne Hathaway, who gets a job as the second assistant to a ruthless fashion magazine editor, Meryl Streep.<br /><br />At first, Hathaway's, Andy Sachs, thinks the fashion business is a joke and only stays on board to pay the rent until she can get a real job for a newspaper.<br /><br />After days of ruthless, stinging barbs about her weight and sense of style, Sachs decides to join the team and begins wearing the latest trends.<br /><br />As she gets deeper and deeper into the business, her relationships with her friends begin to suffer.<br /><br />Things come to a head when Sachs is invited to Paris with her boss.<br /><br />For a girly movie based on a book, this film wasn't too bad. I'm a hesitant fan of Hathaways. I'm not much of a Streep fan (does she have to cry in every movie?) but the music and the style of this film kept it interesting.<br /><br />There was enough humor in it to keep me on the couch on a Valentine's Day.</p></body></html>

See it's supposed to be a mixed and twisted love story of how four people meet in the weirdest ways but in the end it just tells the tale of an enormous puzzle of lust, conflict, heartbreak, and most of all lust. For me this movie was a comedy, just wait until you hear the dirty words that come out of their mouths and the crazy computer scene. The problem is that no matter how hard they tried the only person that truly made you feel she was in love was Natalie Portman. It's not the acting it's just the way these characters were written and it didn't work here. Worst of all Closer is badly jumbled by going from one period of time to another in a matter of seconds and it really didn't need to be in that style. Then they mess up by making the film seem like a dirty movie by emphasizing everything nasty you could think up and more and not on the story itself. In the end the characters don't really get closer but further apart and your left with a movie that is only worth watching for its moments of comedy and only worth watching for the good acting.</p></body></html>

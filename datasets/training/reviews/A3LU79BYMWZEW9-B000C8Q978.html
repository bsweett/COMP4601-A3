Even those of us who love film passionatesly, but who are not professional critics, experience film in quite a different way from those critics, no matter how "of the people" they strive to be in their writing.  Simply put, if you see maybe a couple of films a week, and maybe the majority of those months or years after their release, your experience of those films HAS to differ from those in the pro-crit establishment, who as a professional necessity, live and breathe the cinema.<br /><br />I was thinking about this very fact when I caught Jim Jarmusch's most recent film BROKEN FLOWERS.  I haven't seen nearly as much of his work as I might have liked--not nearly as much as thought I would have by now.  You know how it is, you have a running list of films you intend to see, books you want to read, music you hope to get around to listening to.  Then one day you realize that, hey, there are only so many hours in a day.  And most of those are spoken for by everyday life concerns.  So maybe you better pick and choose your entertainments carefully.<br /><br />It's not too late, of course, but I wish I had chosen to get better acquainted with Jim Jarmusch's work well before now.  The understated humor, thoughtful and episodic approach, and his brutally honest cinematography (which captures the American landscape as it really is) were all elements that I felt I instantly understood and related too.  It's presumptuous at best to say that an artist's sensibility matches your own.  But you can't help but get excited when you begin to feel that kind of spiritual kinship.  In cinema, it happens all too rarely these days.<br /><br />This is what some might call a "quiet film."  Casting Bill Murray as a laconic, vaguely depressive aging Don Juan (punnily named Don Johnston--jokey on a couple of levels, both pretty good) may seem almost too easy.  The aging, alienated hipster is a role that Murray could pretty much phone in.  But no one does it better--and I for one, prefer his jaded performance here to that of say LOST IN TRANSLATION.  He just seems more, well, "at home" wandering the contemporary American landscape than he did in the confines of a Tokyo superhotel and studio.<br /><br />The inconclusive plot will frustrate some, but as some have noted a more conventional "Hollywood" ending would have been less than honest.  The story of a man's initially half-hearted search for a son of whose existence he never knew (and is actually still not sure of) seems like a dismal and futile quest from the outset.  But we go along willingly, in part for the absurd comedy of it all.  In part, because we all have loose ends that were never quite tied up in any satisfactory way.  You can't go back again?  Well, you can try, but you're really going someplace else.<br /><br />As BROKEN FLOWERS suggests, the Information Highway has made tracking down the people in your past much easier than at any time in history.<br /><br />Actually reconnecting with those individuals is quite another matter.</p></body></html>

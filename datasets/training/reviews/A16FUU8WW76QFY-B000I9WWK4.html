When Copper and MacCready (Kurt Russell) arrive to investigate a Norwegian research station after a bizarre, violent incident at their own base, they find some horrific events have taken place.  Upon their return, they discover an alien from space has invaded their American Antarctic Research station, and no one is sure just who is who.<br /><br />"The Thing" was adapted from "Who Goes There?", a classic SF short story by John W. Campbell, and adheres fairly closely to the original.  A fine ensemble cast of actors such as Keith David (Childs)and Richard Masur (Clark) populate the isolated station.  Several of these actors went on to success in show business; for example, David is now narrating "The War", Ken Burns' documentary on America's participation in WWII (now being broadcast on PBS).  With director John Carpenter, the actors do a fine job of projecting the suspicion and fear the monster in their midst has created.<br /><br />A real star of "The Thing" is special effects maestro Rob Bottin, who was only in his 20s when the film was made.  Bottin was given complete creative freedom in designing the horrific appearance of the chameleon-like alien. The beast has a completely different look each time it shows itself, combining the various lifeforms it has absorbed along the way.  The creature is not neat by any means-each appearance is accompanied by buckets of blood and gore.<br /><br />"The Thing" impacted me greatly when I first saw it 25 years ago.  When the sled dog's head split open like a banana being peeled I knew I was in for something different... I had never seen anything quite like it before, and frankly still haven't.  I have this film in my DVD collection, and still watch it regularly...</p></body></html>

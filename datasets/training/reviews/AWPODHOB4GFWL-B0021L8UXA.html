<meta name="summary" content="How Does One Rate This Kind Of Film???"></head><body><p>If you don't like zombie films, you'll find yourself sitting through this one, albeit sometimes reluctantly.  It has all the modern setups of a classic zombie film, but includes enough plot and character development that you start to flip out any time someone is threatening the heroes - ANYONE.  Those heroes would be the Sheriff and his doctor wife.<br /><br />A flashback starts the film with the town being a burned out mess.  It looks like Armageddon, so you know what to expect.  The story then begins when things were normal.  I won't spoil the rich plot, but it includes a scary beginning where the sheriff has to shoot someone at a public town game when he approaches everyone with a rifle.  He is the first `crazie'.  People start showing up at the doctor's office one after another, `not being themselves'.  The weirdness escalates with other bizarre behavior; a man trying to burn down a house with his wife and child inside, hunters finding a government plane in the local pond, a theory of water contamination and hoards of more scary, grisly killings.<br /><br />The military shows up and starts rounding up the crazies with the non-crazies, which is a real treat for these who are still sane.  Some of the healthy are strapped down in gurneys as crazies approach, and well.  It's pretty gory.  Finally the crazies get out of control and the military screws up and everyone gets loose.  It's a wild ride.  There are some great scenes including some non-crazies being trapped in a car going through car wash (very clever) and a nifty car and helicopter chase scene to mix in with all the bloodshed.  It does get to you after a while with the relentless carnage.<br /><br />Of course, in all these disaster movies, the big question is who will survive?  It must be the good sheriff and his doctor wife. Right?  Well, some survive and others don't, like any good zombie movie - you just never know.  The ending is classic as well.  Like a clock, it literally ticks down to the last scene - and then some later on, if you can believe that.</p></body></html>

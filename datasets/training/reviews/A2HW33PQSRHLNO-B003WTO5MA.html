Essentially, this is what the filmmakers decided to do:remake a horror film from the 70's and add some new images to it, making sure to throw in the necessary up-and-coming celebrities.  Not entirely unpleasant, the film has a few genuinely frightening moments: "Look what Ronnie did to me", the young victim's ghost whispers as she places a stoned, ill-willed babysitter's finger into the bulletwound in her ghastly skin.  These moments are few and far between, however, and I can see no real justification for the making of this film.  Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George are unremarkable and hurried in their "transformation" from (sort of) a happy, very much in love couple to two individuals falling apart as the result of a diseased house.  The children in the film who are killed at the beginning, and who later appear as ghosts, seem less annoying then the ones we have to watch the whole movie in the flesh and blood.  Philip Baker Hall's performance as Father Callaway is disappointing and shallow, not holding a candle to Steiger's role in the original.  After it stops being scary (that doesn't take long) and the same hackneyed "demon" devices are rewound in various ways throughout the film, it can't help but occur to one that Hollywood directors are running fresh out of ideas for horror movies.  A dull, unimaginative lot they must be: with the exception of Brad Anderson ("Session 9", "The Machinist), who I believe may be our last hope in this decaying genre.<br /><br />Plus, "Amityville" was always the weakest film in the odd Satanic Renaissance they had in 70's film.  It sat on the sideline beside "The Omen", "Rosemary's Baby", and "The Exorcist".  These three films gave us quite a fright because each one has some possibility about it, something that transcends the petty and reaches right into our gut: the biblically predicted child of Satan finally being born, the story of a possession that actually occured and has never been proven to be a fraud, and Polanski's genius combined with Ira Levin's power as a novelist: "Amityville" had none of these factors backing it up.  A suspension of disbelief is fine, but a willingness to participate in a hoax is another thing entirely: George and Kathy Lutz were con artists who moved into the house knowing precisely what had happened there with the intention of making lots of money by claiming it was haunted.  They themselves even ended up recanting parts of it.<br /><br />For anyone who doesn't know, the whole matter was debunked by the Catholic Diocese of Rockville and William Weber, the lawyer for Ronald Defeo himself.  People have lived in that house since:tables do not fly around, dishes don't crash, and nothing but the standard foulness sits in the toilet.  The young man who shot his family to death was a generic psychopath who had been using drugs near the time of the slayings, lied pathologically, and enjoyed what he did thoroughly by his own admission.  The Defeo family was alcoholic and dysfunctional.  On the stand he claimed demonic possession and a host of other invented ailments:insanity, personality disorders, a dissociative condition, none of which he actually had.  The real "horror" of this whole thing is Ronnie himself.  That is the true story.<br /><br />I would, though, recommend "Amityville Horror II:The Possession".  It is an overlooked gem.<br /><br />So much for the magic, eh?</p></body></html>

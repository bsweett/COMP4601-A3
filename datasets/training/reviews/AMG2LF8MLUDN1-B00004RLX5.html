<meta name="summary" content="Lot's of Laughs!"></head><body><p>This is probably by far the funniest of the Star Trek motion pictures.  The crew of the Enterprise has found Spock and are trying to get home when they receive a signal from earth telling them to stay away because of the impending doom of the planet.  Of course this is how Kirk gets out of the dog house (in the previous film he disobeyed Star Fleet orders and stole a starship to look for Spock) because as we all know, he's the only one that can save the earth.  An alien probe has returned to earth to communicate with hump backed whales.  The problem is that they are extinct on the earth of the future.  Unbeknownst to the probe, its communications begin to destroy earth's atmosphere and the weather goes nuts and 100% cloud cover prevents the sun's rays from reaching the earth.<br /><br />So where do you get these whales for the probe to communicate with?  From earth of the past of course.  So sets the premise for the film.  The laughs are mostly due to Mr. Spock not being quite himself and also from the fact that the crew has had to return to earth of the past in a Klingon Bird of Prey (with the cloaking device).<br /><br />Yes there is a message here.  Take care of the earth or it won't be able to take care of you!<br /><br />Some would say the story is far fetched but it's science fiction.  It's supposed to be far fetched.  The kids will love it even if they don't know Star Trek.  There's no nudity and no real foul language.  Also you won't find much violence either.  This film is kid friendly.<br /><br />Go ahead and purchase with confidence.  May the force be with you! (oops, wrong scifi series!!)  Live long and prosper.  Enjoy.</p></body></html>

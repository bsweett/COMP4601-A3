I don't care what this actress' age is: she is sexy, she is sweet and she can act. And boy, did she have to really act in this otherwise strange, lifeless film.<br /><br />I know, I know: it's TIM BURTON! It's JOHNNY DEPP! It's a ton of British and other loveable voices from today's Great Age of Cinema! It's innovative in color, CGI animation and other nonentities. Ho-HUM!!<br /><br />Why am I so icy about this film? Well, where to start. 1) Crispin Glover (THE DONNER PARTY) whom I have always loved deserves a better major comeback than this. 2) Alan Rickman could have found a different speech cadence than Severus Snape to play the caterpillar. Also ... enough of Helena Bonham Carter and her amateurish, over-the-top nonsense and one may say the same about Depp, by the way. Where is the Depp of SLEEPY HOLLOW?<br /><br />The great Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat was one of the highlights of this rather boring and at times disturbing 'sequel' to the classic Alice in Wonderland story I know from my childhood. (Never liked it.) Michael Sheen was a very welcome voice; Anne Hathaway was downright creepy as she usually is. Christopher Lee, a lifelong favorite of mine, sounds too much like Count Dooku.<br /><br />I'd only add: buy at your own risk. Though it has superlative special effects and some brightness of spirit, I didn't like it, but that's just me. So don't come throwing hate-mail-wrapped bricks through my windows.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great performances, so-so movie..."></head><body><p>Mystic River has great performances. It finally won Sean Penn an oscar and got Tim Robbins one which was well deserved. By now you have heard about the plot and know what to expect. The only thing I think hasn't been touched on alot was the ending. Once you figure out who did it, it really isn't all that great. Why? Because when you learn the motive, it makes the movie seem kinda overdone. The performances are good, but the movie can't quite make up for that.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unbelievebly fun and entertaining! Best action movie since the A-Team. Watch this with popcorn, I loved this movie. I say A"></head><body><p>A train with no driver filled with deadly chemicals is out of control and it is up to Frank (Washington) and Will (Pine) to find a way to stop it.  After leaving his cab to try and apply the independent brake, the train gets away from the driver.  Frank and Will are the only two in posistion to be able to stop "a missile the size of the Chrysler building" before it causes an epic disaster.  I have to admit I was not excited about watching this.  I'm so glad I did.  If you looking for a movie with intricate plot twists that keep you guessing...this is not it.  If your looking for a deeply moving film that tugs at you emotions...this is not it.  If you want an edge of you seat experience that grabs you from the first scene and doesn't let go...THIS IS IT!!!  This movie is so much fun to watch, very fast moving - the defination of a white-knuckle thrill ride. Hands down the best action movie since the A-Team.  I give it an A.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Absolutley, I felt like watching it as soon as it was over.  I would buy this!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Bomb Squad"></head><body><p>Hard to fault this movie as it provides a very compelling portrait of the troops in Iraq, and with the use of hand-held 16 mm cameras certainly gives you the feeling of being there.  However, I found myself wondering why Bigelow chose to make this so exclusively a "boys' movie," with no significant women characters and little feeling for the Iraqis except for the empathy Sgt. Will James felt for young "Beckham."<br /><br />Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00096S45I">Gunner Palace</a>, The Hurt Locker is one for the soldiers serving in combat.  She takes you into their world, and makes you see Iraq through their eyes.  In this case, we follow a "bomb squad" as they defuse land mines around Baghdad and in one compelling scene venture into the desert where they come across some private contractors and soon find themselves under fire by insurgents.<br /><br />If you are looking for more in this "war movie" you will probably be disappointed as Bigelow chose to make this movie politically non-partisan, based more or less on Mark Boal's "embedded" stories from 2004, when he was a journalist in Iraq.  The movie lacks the inner struggle that is found in Chris Hedges' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400034639">War Is a Force that Gives Us Meaning</a> which she references at the start of her movie with the phrase, "war is a drug."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sin City"></head><body><p>Hartigan (Willis) is a cop who is on his last case, saving a young girl from the a seriel rapist (Stahl).  Marv (Rourke), after finding love in the arms of Goldie (King), wakes up to find her dead. Dwight (Owen) is helping the hookers of Old Town cover up the accidental murder of Rafferty (Del Toro), and preserve the uneasy peace.  All three are residents of crime-ridden Sin City.<br /><br />"Sin City" is the most stylish movie to hit theaters since "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow".  "Sin City", however, has much more to offer.  Stylish and comic book-y, directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller deliver a film that feels live a graphic novel come to life.  Shot in black and white with some reds and yellows thrown in, "Sin City" engages the eyes as well as the mind.<br /><br />Willis, Rourke, and Owen are the stars in this ensemble cast.  Each embodies their characters and drives their respective stories.  The standout of the three though, is Rourke.  From under a large amount of makeup, Marv's story is the emotional core of the movie.  His desire for revenge against the people who took the only good thing in his life away from him is the best of the stories.<br /><br />"Sin City" is really an amazing piece of work.  I hope that more "Sin City" stories make the jump to the big screen, but only under Rodriguez's guidance.  One can't halp but feel that he really gets the source material, and has a passion for it.  I highly recommend "Sin City".</p></body></html>

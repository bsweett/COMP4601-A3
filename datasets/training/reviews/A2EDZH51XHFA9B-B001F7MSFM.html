At first I figured he was your basic foreign director: making movies at home that are simply fantastic, being recruited by Hollywood, and then turning out stuff here that's entirely leached of the aspects that make his foreign films so great. And it was the usual formula for a while; he made Cronos at home and Mimic in Hollywood, went home and made The Devil's Backbone, came back and made Blade II. And then came the monkeywrench... Hellboy. del Toro once again teamed up with Ron Perlman, who was so phenomenal in Cronos (and the only thing about Blade II of worth), and came up with one of the best comic book superhero adaptations of the last two decades. (Then he went home and made Pan's Labyrinth, and damn if that wasn't a game-changer.) Inevitably, because it's Hollywood, a successful comic-book movie had to have a sequel, and so along came The Golden Army. Surprisingly, they got this one right, too, with the relevant cast and crew coming back, a bigger budget, and the same sense of stupid fun that made the first movie so good.<br /><br />We start off with a flashback to Professor Broom (John Hurt) reading the fable of the Golden Army to Hellboy as a child. Fast-forward to present, and the Kingdom of the Elves, who built the Golden Army, is in turmoil. King Balor (Roy Dotrice, from the highly-anticipated A Game of Thrones adaptation), who originally negotiated a treaty with humanity to never unleash the Golden Army, is grown old and feeble, and while his daughter Nuala (Crusoe's Anna Walton) is right there with him on that, his son Nuada (Blade II's Luke Goss) is disgusted with what the humans have done to the earth. He unofficially declared war on them, in fact, by blasting his way into a New York City auction house where a piece of the crown used to control the Golden Army was being auctioned off. Part of the treaty involved the splitting up of the crown; one piece went to the humans, while the elves kept two. Now Nuada has the human piece, and needs to get the others from his dad. Where does Hellboy (Perlman) fit into all of this? Well, when he's not fighting with his girlfriend Liz (Kath & Kim's Selma Blair), the two of them, along with old pal Abe Sapien (del Toro regular Doug Jones), and their human handler Manning (Jeffrey Tambor), do things like investigate auction houses where elves come and slaughter people in order to get back a piece of crown. As it usually is with Hellboy, the investigation is a comeplete cock-up, and the government sends in a new guy to head up the department, Johann Krauss (played at various times by Layer Cake's James Dodd and Men in Black II's John Alexander, but voiced by Seth MacFarlane of Family Guy fame). Given Hellboy's entrance into this world, he's not too happy with Germans, as a rule...<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, this is not as good a movie as Hellboy. it suffers from pacing problems, it dwells a bit much on the soap-opera aspects of the relationship between Hellboy and Liz (though rest assured this does become germane to the plot), and it could have used a slightly more zealous editor; it runs maybe ten minutes longer than it should. And I know there are quite a few fans of the first film in the franchise who hated this one, but I can't quite imagine why. Yes, there's a bunch of eco-silliness in the plot and the aforementioned pace problems rear their ugly heads a time or two, but the Hellboy flicks are about two things: a whole lot of action and Guillermo del Toro's fabulist vision of the world. Rest assured you're going to get the former, and as for the latter, the only time del Toro has failed to deliver was in Blade II, where his hands were tied by an already-existing iconography. The world of The Golden Army is that same blend of the real and the fantastic that's made all of his foreign movies so amazing. For sheer visual spectacle, it's hard to beat del Toro. And while the film is a bit slack and soap-opera-y, it's still big, stupid fun. ***</p></body></html>

I've never really cared for any of Portman's performance prior to Black Swan, but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and why she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Surprise, surpise...Portman is absolutely stellar in this film! Her facial expressions and dancing are what carries this film. Barbara Hershey is also fabulous as Portman's controlling mother. The only performance I found awkward and stiff was Mila Kunis's. Kunis is a beautiful woman but she doesn't have a lot of depth to pull off such a complex character. Black Swan was definitely worth all the hype, has some odd moments but overall...I'd watch it again!</p></body></html>

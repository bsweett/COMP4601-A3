Moore hit another HUGE homerun, this film hits you in the gut<br />from start to finish, weaves a devastating story, and is the first<br />and last thing you need to know about U.S. health care:  IT SUCKS !!<br />We're a bunch of suckers in the USA.  I shed a tear when the U.S.<br />rescue workers were embraced by their Cuban firefighting brothers.<br />Thank god someone can recognize a hero, apparently the U.S. government<br />cannot!  Next time you see a bright, shining skyscraper with a medical insurance, hmo, or drug company logo on the top, just remember all the dead and chronically ill people that were swindled, left to die or suffer untreated for the rest of their lives just so some top executives and CEOs can be filthy rich and the richest 1% can see their multi-million and billion dollar stock holdings appreciate.  We are all suckers in the U.S.  As the brillant british gentleman said, "If you can pay to kill people, certainly you can pay to save people".  That's all you need to remember.</p></body></html>

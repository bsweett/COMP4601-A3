<meta name="summary" content="Top notch superhero flick"></head><body><p>Very strong movie that stands up there with the original Batman with Michael Keaton and the original Spider-Man with Toby Maquire, and let's not forget about Superman!  Who knows if they'll ever make a decent Hulk, X-men or Avengers (coming soon).  Good modern adaptation of the story.  Ending was a bit heavy, and I wasn't particularly enamored with Bridges role, but Downey and Paltrow worked great.  They'll have to get creative with SHEILD for the sequel to work.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg's masterpiece"></head><body><p>CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is one of Spielberg's most personal films, and one of his best DVDs. Originally released in 1977, Spielberg re-released it with additional footage in 1980, then altered it again for the film's 1997 re-release on VHS with the extra footage dropped and some scenes never released put back in. This DVD is the definitive version of Spielberg's classic, with the extra sections making the film's progress more involving than when it was first released.<br />Extra stuff aside, does the film itself deserve a place in the collection of all-time great Science Fiction? The answer is a resounding yes, as the film conveys a sense of excitement, wonder and obsession. Different from other nihlistic sci fi films (The Alien movies), Close Encounters is a story of a man (Richard Dreyfuss), who, after having an encounter with a U.F.O, starts to become fixated with images and sounds that draw him to the film's conclusion.<br />Dreyfuss, who also starred in Spielberg's own Jaws (1975), is brilliant in this film, with his gradual obsessions and transfixion creating a fascinating film, which has become an undisputed classic. While perhaps not as essential as the 2 Disc version with lots of extras, CE3K is an impressive film in any format.</p></body></html>

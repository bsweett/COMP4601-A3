From the beginning of the film on, we have to confront facts that could or couldn't be true. For instance, Mr. Goodkat's frightening story about the slaughter of an entire family told to Nick Fisher seems very much real to us but, as soon as the hitman kills Nick Fisher, we have doubts about the story's reality. Secondly, the rest of the film is told according to Slevin's subjective point of view so that we are led to believe that what Slevin sees or tells is necessarily true. Like in an Agatha Christie book, we have to wait for the last 10 minutes of the film to discover who was lying and what really happened during the former 90 minutes. It's the essence of Cinema : to manage to convince the audience that what is shown on the screen is true.<br /><br />Now, I didn't feel any peculiar Tarantino influence in LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN, the movie lives by itself and frankly, it deserves to be seen if you like a smart story with good actors such as Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Stanley Tucci, Lucy Liu, Bruce Willis and Josh Hartnett. Highly recommended.<br /><br />A DVD zone Bruce's new haircut.</p></body></html>

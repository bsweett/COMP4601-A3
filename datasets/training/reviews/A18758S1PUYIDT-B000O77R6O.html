Hugh Jackman did the best he could with the confusing, slow, dull script, without much help from the miscast Rachel Weisz.  Apparently she had a brain tumor and he was trying to find a way to save her--but then it turns out she's writing a novel with the same title as the film, and it spans the lives of two similar people from 1500 AD to 2000 AD to 2500 AD. And there are Mayan things and a star and a fountain of youth tree, and ......I don't know.  Who cares?  I can usually follow convoluted plots, but this was just too much.</p></body></html>

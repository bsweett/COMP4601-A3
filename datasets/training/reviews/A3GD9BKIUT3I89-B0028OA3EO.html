Said to be a sequel to SUPERMAN & SUPERMAN II, it lacks the feel of the Donner film and not even the Donner/Lester amalgamation that is the 2nd film.  I like Brandon Routh as Kent/Superman.  He isn't Christopher Reeve but he does a pretty decent job.  Kevin Spacey is a truly vile and vicious Lex Luthor, Parker Posey a trip as his girlfriend Kitty.  Frank Langella is ok as Perry White (stepping in after Hugh Laurie had to bow out), Sam Huntington a good Jimmy Olson and Eva Marie Saint as Ma Kent.  As the acting goes, the weak link is Kate Bosworth.  She is such a lousy Lois Lane.  What killed this project -- it was a $200 million production that made money but not enough (movies have to do double their cost to break EVEN) -- it is dark, it is violent and long and kinda boring.  What Singer managed to infuse into the X-Men franchise he couldn't do for the Man of Steel.  Will we see another Superman adventure on the big screen?  I am confident.  It might be years but you can't keep a good man down.</p></body></html>

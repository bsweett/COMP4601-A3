<meta name="summary" content="Shoulda been called 'House of 2000 Corpses'"></head><body><p>I'll say right up front that I saw this with out having seen 'House of 1000 Corpses'. Reports were that that movie was no good, and that it wasn't liable to make too much of a difference if you'd seen the original to get the sequel. I suspect I was correct. Either way, this is a pretty good movie. Some will tell you this isn't a horror movie, and they do sorta have a point, but, on the other hand, 'The Devil's Rejects' is the kinda film that is pretty much only going to appeal to people who consider themselves horror fans. As you've doubtless heard a million times, this movie is in the vein of 'Last House on the Left' and 'The Hills Have Eyes', and if those are horror movies so is this. Actually this leaves me in a kinda strange position, as those are the two most obvious predecessors to this film, but I don't like either of those movies very much, as much as I enjoy 70's horror in general. Of course, the problem with those films was mainly in execution rather than concept, so if you do it right you can make it work. And Zombie made it work here.<br /><br />This film is pleasantly short on plot. Basically, there is a family of murderers, and a vengeful, nutty cop who wants to get them. They kill people and fight one another etc. It's mostly situation based, as the family takes hostages and murders people and just generally creates havoc. Oddly enough, this film is much more reliant on the performances than is your typical horror film. The clan members all verge on parody, but they keep it held back just enough to make them believable, and I suppose one might say that that would be the goal when it comes to making ludicrously villainous characters. Sid Haig is Captain Spaulding, the father of the family, and while he's pretty evil, of course, he's the most charming, playful member of the family. Haig does a real good job with him. Bill Moseley is Otis, the craziest, most sadistic one. His performance is much praised, perhaps over praised. He's believable enough, but not really that interesting. The director's wife plays Baby. This sorta nepotism is always worrisome, but she stands up passably well against the other leads. The real standout, however, is William Forsythe as Sheriff Wydell. He is... intense. In a way this hurts the film, as I believe we are supposed to sympathize with the family towards the end of the film. This didn't happen for me, largely due to the strength of Forsythe's performance. He's a very bad man too, no doubt, but still not as bad as them, and he's just more compelling and intriguing than any of them, too. Zombie stuff a few old horror icons into small roles, most notably Ken Foree and Michael Berryman. Zombie deserves some credit for making them be there for a reason, making it not feel like a cameo. I like that kinda stuff, but I want it to flow nicely, and not *feel* like a cameo. (The Takashi Miike scene in Hostel, anyone? Still, that movie was pretty good. If you like this you'll probably like that, though it's quite a bit more modern. I wrote a review of it for Amazon, but alas I used a naughty word and they didn't post it, nor will they ever let me write another one now, for some reason. Jerks.)<br /><br />This is an ugly, ugly film, grainy and washed out, with grimy scenery and filled with unattractive people, many of whom do not have enough clothes. Many people will be understandably put off by this, but I think the grit works. I should note that though this is a violent film, it isn't very gory. (The one exception is when one person is run over by a large truck, with splattery results.) Still, there are plenty of scenes that will put off less adventurous viewers, so consider yourself warned. The film also deserves credit for being relatively unpredictable. The lack over any real protagonist means it's tough to say who is likely to survive til the end. And the final scene was quite surprising to me, and I thought it worked pretty well. (Well, actually the execution is a bit overwrought, but I think the concept it good enough.)  The film also has quite a bit of humor, and I think it was generally surprisingly funny.  Fortunately, Zombie holds back enough on the humor that it doesn't really dilute the intensity.<br /><br />The most notable flaw in the film is the opening firefight.  To be blunt, it's just dull.  Zombie needs to work on his action scenes a bit.  Not too big a problem, but definitely noticeable.  Also, the period songs are occasionally distracting and obvious.  Still, no big deal.<br /><br />Hmm, I haven't really said much, but I'm tired of writing. It's pretty good. Not fantastic or groundbreaking, but worth seeing.<br /><br />Grade: B-</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Courtesy Three Stars"></head><body><p>I watched this movie with the family and found it only mildly entertaining.  Certainly the imagry was wonderful, yet, the story was only okay from my perspective.  Sadly, "just okay" is not something that I ever expect from the talented duo of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.<br /><br />I must confess also that the oompla loompa was pretty creepy and distracted me from the story.<br /><br />A bigger indicator for me {and parents looking for a good family movie} was the overall lack of appreciation and interest from my kids.<br /><br />I give this movie a three stars vote out of respect for Burton and Depp and the effort they put forth, but I think the true mark lies somewhere between two and three stars.</p></body></html>

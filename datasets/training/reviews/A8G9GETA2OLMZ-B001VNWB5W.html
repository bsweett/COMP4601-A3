For example, clearly avoiding nuclear holocaust is preferable to merely cleaning up streetgangs who happened to hurt a friend.<br /><br />And it tries to get beyond the rigid dualism of GOOD vs. EVIL, by intimating that most of the times things are not so clear.  For example, Veidt is a liar and a murderer, but does it in a greater cause--which really is a greater cause, and not merely self-serving.<br /><br />Also, it presents a lot of characters, and they go through changes--all of which adds interest.  Oddly, Rorschach is the most interesting, and the best actor.<br /><br />However, the take on social issues, while laudable in principle, is lame in practice.  The movie is still hobbled by its "the political is always personal" outlook.  For example, when Veidt and Rorschach finally face off, no resolution is possible except for one of them to blow the other up.<br /><br />As in all superhero movies, the special effects are more important than the people.  You don't really know if Billy Crudup is affectless because the character demands it, or if he just can't act.<br /><br />All in all, this picture is unsettling and not very instructive or fun.<br /><br />I'm glad I saw it.  And I will never watch it again.</p></body></html>

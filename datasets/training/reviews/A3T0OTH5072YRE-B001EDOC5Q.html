<meta name="summary" content="Prince Caspian: The Movie"></head><body><p>This is the 2nd installment of the movie adaptations of C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia.  In this, much of our beloved characters have returned along with a few new faces as well.<br /><br />After being away for awhile, the Pevensie children find themselves being whisked back to Narnia and dumped on to what once was their home.  Realizing that it is hundreds of years later, they wonder why they have been brought back.  When they rescue a dwarf and learn that a Prince is trying to free the Narnians from years of oppression they know they have to help.  But Aslan isn't around to help as much this time, and their foe seems unbeatable.<br /><br />Characters:<br />William Moseley: Peter Pevensie<br />Anna Popplewell: Susan Pevensie<br />Skandar Keynes: Edmund Pevensie<br />Georgie Henley: Lucy Pevensie<br />Ben Barnes: Prince Caspian<br />Liam Neeson: Aslan<br /><br />Once again all of the characters were well cast and I was glad the original characters came back for this sequel (and subsequent ones).  The continuity always helps in a series.  Peter was kind of annoying in this movie, but I think he was supposed to have some strife so I guess that explains the motivations. Lucy was still as wonderful as ever and it was amazing to see how Georgie Henley grew up.  I liked the addition of Reepicheep as well as he is always amusing in his daring mousy ways.<br /><br />This movie mostly stuck close to the book.  There wasn't too much changed anyway.  All the main aspects of the book were included, such as the Uncle's deviousness and Prince Caspian's will to fight for the Narnians.  I do have to complain about the amount of battle scenes in this movie.  Maybe some people enjoy it, but for being an exciting clash of war, I actually got bored with it because it went on so long.  It jus seemed like more was devoted to the battle scenes than to the actual storyline itself.  So much could have been added that wasn't.<br /><br />The special effects, once again, were tremendous in this movie.  The centaurs and other creatures came to life.  The music too was wonderful as usual.  Still hauntingly beautiful and completely fitting to the tone of Narnia.<br /><br />It still wasn't a terrible movie.  Quite good when you think about book to movie's that have come before.  If you enjoyed the first, you'll surely enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011</p></body></html>

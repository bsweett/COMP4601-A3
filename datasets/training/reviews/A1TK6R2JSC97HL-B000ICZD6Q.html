Living the life that most of us can only wish for, Foreman sells ad space for a sports magazine, has a great family and the kind of work-place camaraderie you only see in sit-coms.  That is, until his mag is acquired by a power-mad Australian tycoon known only as "Teddy K" (though immediately recognizable as Malcom Macdowell).  In the evitable shake-up, Foreman is demoted and must now serve one of Teddy K's instant-MBA monsters, a man who looks more like an intern than an exec.  Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), a man whose blood supply is polluted by large concentrations of caffeine, is liitle older than half Foreman's age when he becomes Foreman's boss.  (A birthday in the middle of the movie puts Foreman well over the milestone of serving a man half as old as he is.)  Full of corporate oomph while a compulsively nice guy, Duryea is emotionally hollow and compulsively self-centered.  Forced to downsize Dan's department, Duryea tries to buddy up to ad execs who know to expect an axing.  Because he needs Dan, Duryea latches onto his new "wingman" in a big way, inviting himself over to Dan's house for a sunday dinner, and unwittingly falling for Foreman's college-age daughter.  Knowing that Dan's sensitive enough about his precarious job situation, Duryea wisley keeps the romance secret, but Foreman's too smart to remain in the dark for long.<br /><br />This was more of a promising idea than a great movie.  The dialog is pretty thin, the characterizations quite shallow<br /><br />and the dilemmas never explored.  Though Dan's big worry is of becoming a dinosaur made extinct by a newer (and younger) breed of exec like Duryea, the story never realizes that fear.  Job security aside, Teddy K's sycophantic minions never put Dan's skills at risk - we never have any reason to believe that Carter's breed will actually outlast Dan's more experienced ways, and certainly not with Teddy K's rantings of "synergy".  (The concept is meant to make individual components of larger companies stronger by allowing them to work in concert; in practice, and in this story, they prove more hazard than help since, as Dan finds, former clients are now competitors of Teddy K's other acquisitions) Then there's Carter's secret romance with Alex (Scarlet Johanson), Dan's pride and joy.  Improbably they connect, though the script glosses over the attraction (we see them walking and talking, and guess they're sleeping around).  Pretty soon, we begin to wonder whether she's got as much interest in a future with Duryea as she has in her past with her father, and whether she'll discard him as his wife did in the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />WHY YOU SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE:  "Company" offers some fine performances by Dennis Quaid (the dinosaur most of us wish we could morph into shortly before extinction), and Topher Grace as Duryea, who seems oblivious to the humiliation his age inflicts on Dan; There's also David Paymer as a less fortunate colleague of Dan's, and a string of smaller palyers who somehow come alive despite the deadening script.</p></body></html>

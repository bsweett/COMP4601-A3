Clooney is an attorney in a huge law firm who never goes to court. His job is as a janitor who cleans up everybody else's messes. And the mess in this movie-- at least one of them-- is that the lead attorney Arthur (Wilkinson), who is defending a three billion class action lawsuit, appears to have gone bananas in a deposition and removed all his clothes except his shoes and socks.<br /><br />The plot is complex and not for the lazy so it is probably better appreciated in the luxury of your own home away from  a theatre overrun with talkers and cell phones. There are several threads woven into the plot. Clayton (Clooney) has both family problems and money problems of his own that he has to "clean up," along with his janitorial duties at work. (The kid who plays Clayton's son, by the way, almost steals the movie away from Clooney.)<br /><br />The DVD version permits the viewer to watch this film in its entirety with the director's comments in a voice-over. After listening to about ten minutes or so of Gilroy's remarks and he was still informing us of how he came to make this film, blah, blah, blah, I decided I had heard enough. Listening to directors expound on their films is 99 times out of 100 a waste of one's precious life.<br /><br />As I watched this fine performance by Mr. Clooney, I remembered an article I read a couple of years or so ago when Bill O'Reilly opined that Clooney's left-leaning political views would sound the death knell of his acting career. What do you think of your brown-eyed boy now, Mr. O'Reilly?</p></body></html>

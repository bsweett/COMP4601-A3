Now, within the space of a week and a half, I've seen Advise and Consent, Hard Core Logo, and Hard Candy, and if I were making up a list of the ten best films I saw in 2006, I'd have a very, very hard time choosing one of the three to top it.<br /><br />Now, I should warn you from the outset: this is one of those films that you will either love or hate, probably depending on how you feel about the subject matter itself. It's hard to summarize the plot, or even give the obvious comparisons, without spoilers-- and it should be mentioned here that the advertising campaign for this movie was about as perfect as it gets in its painstaking insistence on not giving a single blessed thing away about this flick while still keeping interest levels high; the final three-quarters of the movie I never saw coming. Bravo to the marketing team (and that's something I almost never say).<br /><br />In any case, the drama here surrounds to characters: photographer Jeff Kohlver (Angels in America's Patrick Wilson) and teen Hayley Stark (X-Men: The Last Stand's Ellen Page). In the opening scene, there's some typical online flirting that leads to a meeting between the two; Jeff is painted as something of a morally ambivalent character from the outset, but nothing here is going to prepare you for what follows-- none of which I can tell you about without spoilers. You'll have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />As I said, it's the subject matter that will cause your reaction to this film, because how the subject matter is handled is absolutely above reproach. Both Wilson and Page play their roles to the hilt without overplaying them (though there are some clever uses of, shall we say, mood-altering substances that allow for some latitude in that regard); the film is written by Brian Nelson, who's penning the script for the upcoming 30 Days of Night, and it's directed by David Slade of Do Geese See God?. Everyone here, with the ironic exception of some of the cameos (Sandra Oh makes a brief appearance) and Page-- who's been in the business for about a decade, having gotten her start in the good TV series Pit Pony back in the day-- is a relative newcomer to this business, and all of them show that they have a very, very good handle on how to make a bang-up movie.<br /><br />The spoiler thing is frustrating, because there are two films to which I'd like to favorably compare this movie, one of them firmly lodged in my top ten favorite films of all time. But, as I keep saying, you'll just have to see it for yourself. It falls squarely into a particular subgenre of thriller that seems to turn out excellent movies whenever it pops up, and Hard Candy is no exception. You will love this film or you will hate it, but either way, you have to admit that the folks who made this movie did one hell of a good job getting you to love it or hate it. This is fantastic stuff. **** ?</p></body></html>

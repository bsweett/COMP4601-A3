Apparently it's when it involves breaking our immigration laws. Sad to see how "freely" this movie depicts the act. It really shows how we've somehow slipped into this euphoric state where we longer care about our borders. Really glad the Minute Men have the guts to do what our goverenment DOESN'T. Back to the movie: Ok, the characters were not likeable, the pacing was dull, and even Adam couldn't salvage this mess. If you liked real comedies like As Good As It Gets or Punch Drunk Love steer clear of this train wreck.</p></body></html>

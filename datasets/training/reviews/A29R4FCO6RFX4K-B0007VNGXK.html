<meta name="summary" content="Hellboy"></head><body><p>Guillermo del Toro's HELLBOY is one of the best comic book movies I have ever seen. Ranking up there with BATMAN RETURNS and SPIDER-MAN, this is a fantastic example of everything a movie of this genre should have: Great action, spectacle without overkill, story before style and a leading man who carries the whole movie on his broad shoulders. Ron Pearlman is unquestionably the perfect guy for the role, eschewing the usual moody, anti-heroes of previous CB movies that tried (And failed) at setting the bar for excellence, this is a film that rides on no ones coattails, instead shows off its originality well. The music is brooding and stylish, the supporting cast is excellent and the villains are great fun. So what else is there to say?  If you haven?t seen it, go see it now, and if you have already, then see it again. Now.</p></body></html>

I still remember the first book I cried at the end of (Magic's Price by Mercedes Lackey, the book series that also helped me come out), and that was when I was 19. I was twenty-five before I cried at my first movie (Titanic). It wasn't until three years later when I saw A.I. - Artificial Intelligence that I did it again. So I'm not overly sentimental, as you may have gathered from this and most of my blog.<br /><br />But lately I've been crying like a baby at a bunch of different movies. Everything from The Red Balloon, to Up, to Where the Wild Things Are, getting me to cry at a movie is getting easier and easier. Maybe they're just shamelessly manipulative, or maybe I'm starting menopause.<br /><br />To that list of films that had me all weepy we can now add Toy Story 3. I'm not a long-term fan of the Toy Story franchise. I only saw the first and second one a few weeks ago when Amazon had blu-ray versions on sale for $30 if you bought both. I saw them and liked them, so I was looking forward to this newest version.<br /><br />Our film opens with Andy, the boy who owns the toys, getting ready to head to college. He's seventeen and hasn't played with his toys in years. These days Woody, Buzz and the rest spend most of their time sitting around in the toy box inventing new ways to get Andy to come open it and peer inside. This does not make for a happy set of toys.<br /><br />Eventually the day comes when Andy is packing up to go. He plans to take Woody with him to school and put the other toys in the attic, but due to some confusion on his mother's part all the toys end up out on the curb ready to get picked up by the garbage men. Woody, seeing this, rushes down to help and through a series of unfortunate incidents the toys then end up at a daycare center.<br /><br />Life there seems to be ideal, especially for Barbie once she meets Ken, but Woody's main concern is getting back home to Andy. He tries to rally the other toys, but no one wants to come along. Eventually he leaves as the toys that remain learn that paradise isn't what it seems to be.<br /><br />There's plenty of action and peril in this movie, a bit more so than in the others. In addition to a menacing purple teddy-bear and his creepy baby-doll henchman, there's also many sharp blades, a grinder, flames, and, perhaps most dangerous of all, toddlers. The resolutions to the various bits of peril were entertaining and satisfying, including one resolution that I'll describe as machina ex machina.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect (I could really do without Randy Newman's music. Ever), but I really enjoyed it, and the final scene is fitting, moving and deeply wonderful. This is one of the few movies I've seen this year that I actively look forward to seeing again, and while that's not saying much given that this summer has included films like Grown Ups, it is nevertheless a great recommendation.</p></body></html>

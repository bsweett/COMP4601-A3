<meta name="summary" content="Good on its Own, But No Surprise with This Cast"></head><body><p>Don't ever try to compare "Red Dragon" with "The Silence of the Lambs."  The "prequel" of the story of Hannibal Lector, which is once made by director Michael "Heat" Mann as "Manhunter" before, is just an OK thriller.  You get scared, certainly, but not by the undercurrent phychological power of "Lambs," but by sudden big noise and loud, pounding music by Danny Elfman.<p>The story is virtually same as that of "Manhunter" except that you see Dr. Lector as a civilian in Boltimore, listening to classic music among other law-abiding people (a rare scene, indeed), and that the relation between Dolarhyde and Reba has been explored more.  A retired FBI agent Will Graham agrees to go back in work to investigate the two related bloody murders of families, and to have an aid he meets again Master of Evil, Hannibal Lector, now in maximum-security custody in institution, as you saw in "Lams."  But with Lector's cunning trick Graham and his family are exposed to the danger of the still unknown serial killer, who is sure to commit another murder within days.<p>The speed is fast enough to forget the plot holes, and the thrills are provided a lot, thanks to Ted Tally's good script.  The new cast is also effective with Edward Norton as Graham and of course Anthony Hopkins as Lector.  Norton, unlike his predecessor William Pertersen in "Manhunter", doesn't yell at TV set to "think like the killer," which is a good thing.  Philip Seymore Hoffman is also good as a gossip-hungry journalist while my favorite, impressive Harvey Keitel replaces Dennis Farrina role as an FBI partner.<p>But I found two defects in "Red Dragon"; one of them is that there is no sizzling interaction between Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins across the cell wall.  The same set was recreated for this film, I heard, but there is no tension during their dialogues (which I found almost the same as those in "Manhunter.")  It is curious because they must have decided to remake this one to capitalize on the popularity of Hopkins' Lector, and as if to show that to us, they give more chances for Graham to meet Lector (in "Manhunter" they meet only once face to face).  The reason for the lower tension might be attributed to Hopkins's less interest, but my feeling is that it should be owing to director's skill.<p>The other flaw is less convincing relation between the characters by Emily Watson and Ralph Fiennes.  It is certain that their roles are given more time, but I frankly say that I find that part boring.  I simply couldn't help thinking that they overact a bit, especially Fiennes with body tattoos and exaggerated gestures, which are bordering on caricature.  As for this sub-plot, Tom Noonan and Joan Allen did a better job.<p>"Red Dragon" succeeds as fast-paced thriller, but without depth.  Brett Ratner is famous for two "Rush Hour" films, which are certainly hits, but no definite Jackie Chan film.  If you need a definite Lector, you must watch "Lambs" again.</p></body></html>

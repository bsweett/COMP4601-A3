I saw this in 2D, but lots of coming-at-you scenes must have worked beautifully in 3D projection.<br /><br />The bad: pretty much everything else. The story's logic faltered in just too many places. And, for a movie about a scientist, they got way too much of the science horribly wrong. Magnesium never occurs in metallic form in nature because it's so reactive, birds didn't exist 150 million years ago, and, well, lots more. And, despite his best effort to shake it off, Fraser's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304711867">George of the Jungle</a> seems to stand behind every attempt at a dramatic scene. If you want mindless excitement, great, but make sure you understand just how mindless.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></body></html>

But then he'd have to pause.  "Why," I suspect he'd ask, "do my films attract such empty barrels?"<br /><br />Anyway, I hope I'm not one of them.<br /><br />Eyes Wide Shut, I think, is a deceptively simple meditation on human honesty in the context of our dearest human institution ... marriage.  Of course, much of the dishonesty in relationships centers around sexuality, and the conflict between the sexual roles imposed by the institution itself, and the far less clear lines that exists within each of us.  And so, we round pegs shoved in the square holes of an artificial and ancient institution struggle to be both open and closed to each other.<br /><br />In the marriage at the heart of this film, both husband and wife have their own, hidden fantasies, longings, disappointments, and wishes that don't fit neatly into what is expected of them.  Nicole Kidman's character, in a moment of marijuana induced honesty, admits to having something less than an idealized fidelity to her husband ... that the mere glance of a stranger could destroy it all (and nearly did once).  Of course, Cruise's character has secrets of his own, and Kidman's brutal and devastating disclosure plunges him into fugue state where his own conflicts of role and sexuality surface.  Cruise's journey touches on many areas of the "forbidden" ... from homosexuality (the taunting of "roughs" leads him into the hands of a prostitute uncertain whether he belongs there) to a possible dalliance with a patient to a ritualistic orgy.  Of course, much like his wife has owned her hidden side, he must, eventually, own his ... and he does.<br /><br />A central metaphor here is the mask.  And with his mask finally stripped free and sitting on his pillow, Cruise (never before wanting to remove his mask or costume) relents and tells all ... and we can only hope, by that point, that his relationship can survive transformed ... or not.  It depends on who or what you are rooting for, as with any great film.  Their is fodder for both points of view.<br /><br />Eyes Wide Shut is a powerful searchlight into the psychology of sexuality and marriage, into truth and honesty, and into the question of who (and what) we really are.  Don't be put off by the pedantic and lunatic silliness of many of the reviews you'll read.  They're mainly by folks desperate to sound smart, to read more (and sometimes less) into the film than is really there.  Eyes Wide Shut, thankfully, doesn't need their help.</p></body></html>

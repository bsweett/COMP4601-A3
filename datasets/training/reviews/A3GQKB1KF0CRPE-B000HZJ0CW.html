<meta name="summary" content="a very enjoyable entry in the long line of ST films"></head><body><p>I am not going to argue if the film's plot is like another.  I don't watch a film to hold comparisons.  I judge the film strictly on its merits.  And frankly, I really enjoyed this ST entry.  I love the series and have always thought the films never reached the greatness of the series that spun them.  It was bigger, fancier, but ST always revolved around the people not the plot.  And in that this film is one of the best ST films.<p>It maintains that esprit de corps and spectacular film.  Maybe expectations hurt this.  Everyone went in expecting this or that from the film.  I did not, so I truly enjoyed it.  I have watched if several times and each time I am impressed.<p>So kick by and stop analyzing and enjoy the fun.</p></body></html>

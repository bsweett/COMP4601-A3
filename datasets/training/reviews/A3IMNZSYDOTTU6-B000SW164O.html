<meta name="summary" content="A Decent Psychological Thriller With An Ending That Will Scare You...3.5 stars..."></head><body><p>When you have rented a video, have you ever felt like once you watched the entire product you rented that you never thought you'd watch it again for a long time? Well, HIDE AND SEEK happens to be that kind of a movie. It's premise is very tantalizing, its actors are quite solid in their roles, and the twist is somewhat satisfying, while the last shot of the film leaves chills down your spine. HIDE AND SEEK, while a satisfying, does have some holes from time to time that don't keep it from being a good movie...just not a great one.<br /><br />Robert De Niro plays David, a well-respected psychologist who has a cute little daughter, Emily, played by Dakota Fanning. His wife, it seems, committed suicide due to the recent trials of their marriage, which in turn seems to be unwinding at a steady pace in the beginning. David is horrified one night waking up and discovering his wife in a blood-soaked bathtub, with poor Emily shocked and in a complete state of disbelief from what she has seen.<br /><br />We pick up some time later with Emily in a children's hospital working with a staff member (Famke Jennsen, in fine form here) who's trying to help Emily cope with the loss of her mother, while David tries his best to keep being as good a father as he can be. David decides that he and Emily should move somewhere quieter and more peaceful to start fresh, and they move into a new house by a lake which draws a crowd during summertimes. Things seem to go from weird, to worse, as David and Emily grow further apart. Emily, however, develops a friendship with her new imaginary friend, "Charlie", who seems to make her very happy. But "Charlie" isn't interested in harmless child's play and things soon go to worse as after David meets the sweet Elizabeth (Elisabeth Shue, once again acing her acting), "Charlie" begins making bad things happen because he seems to hate David. The rest of the movie plays like an M. Night Shymalan thriller, leaving you guessing what will happen next. Some parts seem tepid and slow, but the "twist" will leave you guessing until it happens. The last shot of the film has Emily and her new friend, the staff member, living together, and while Emily loves to draw, her drawing ultimately leaves the movie open for a sequel, which is yet to appear. I won't give it away but let's just say you'll be left chilled to the bone when you see the "drawing".<br /><br />Dakota Fanning is in superb form here, and at first you want to hate her character so much for the way she treats her father, but as the movie goes along, especially later in the second half, you start to wonder if she's the one you should be afraid for. Nevertheless, she's a pro in this movie, bringing one bone-chilling and rock-solid performance to the table here. Great job kid!!<br /><br />So if you're looking to kill 100 minutes on a Saturday night and get some good chills, HIDE AND SEEK might just be right up your alley. But be warned: the last shot of the movie will send a chill up your spine.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This Wolfman neither bites nor sparkles"></head><body><p>Armed with an alarmingly suspenseful trailer, Benecio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins as leads, and a solid foundation of horror history to carry the major weight, this movie looked like a can't miss home run.  I can't say all expectations were met, but for those who know what they're looking for, entertainment is still possible.<br /><br />To start with, the two leads do not disappoint.  Both carry their scenes competently enough, but don't attempt to overwhelm.  I'd go so far as to say that Del Toro's interpretation of Lawrence Talbot, and the subsequent morose delivery - while normally suited for his roles - doesn't always fit the scene.  Nonetheless, the acting is one of the positives of the film, with Art Malik (the antagonist in True Lies) and Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith, Matrix) rounding out the cast.<br /><br />Estranged family member Lawrence returns home after receiving correspondence about his brother's death of unknown cause.  The only thing known is that his brother was gashed open with unrecognizable claw marks, and his brother's beautiful widow is still hanging around the English mansion - a lavish Victorian monstrosity with enough grandeur fitting of the time and position, and enough moaning floorboards and ten-foot cobwebs to make it spooky - with Lawrence's reclusive father, Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), a man with a shady (some say cursed) past to say the least.  Commence with the investigation into the brother's death, the increasingly revealed werewolf, and the "twist" ending that, when put together, gets a little long in the tooth.<br /><br />The cinematography is predictable but good.  Tons of dark, cloudy nights with impossibly bright moons looming dangerously.  The full moon appears often enough to get an IMDB page.  Similarly, the story sticks to tradition, adding in very good special effects befitting of a big budget movie.  Yet, it's not outstanding.  And therein lies the problem.  Nothing stands out, and there was very little in the way of character connection.  Add in a pointless, inappropriate romance, and result is a somewhat hollow overall feeling.<br /><br />Pretty simply, go into this movie with the understanding that the filmmakers intended to stay true to the werewolf lore and its tragic similarities and to Shakespearean literature, straying as little as possible to avoid the recent Hollywood habit of raping traditional perspective.  Do that and you'll have a good time.  Expecting the Wolfman to live a life happily after, and you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></body></html>

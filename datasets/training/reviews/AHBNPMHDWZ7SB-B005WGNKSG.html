It's a suspenseful drama with aspects of a thriller, and it's based on the Stieg Larsson novel. The story follows an investigative journalist named Mikael Blomkvist who is sentenced to a few months in prison at the start of the film. He has time before he has to clock in and begin his sentence so he takes a job from a very wealthy business man named Henrik Vanger, with a family empire. The business man hires Mikael to find out what happened to his niece that mysteriously disappeared forty years prior. But she's not who the title is based on.<br /><br />The actual girl with the dragon tattoo is a computer hacker who was hired by Mikael's boss to hack into his computer, and find out if he really is guilty of the crimes he was committed for at the start off the film. Don't worry, none of this is a spoiler because we find out all of what I said at the start of the movie. But anyway, the center of the story is the mystery of the disappearance of that wealthy business man's niece. And it is gripping. I have to warn that there are some sexually graphic scenes in this movie. A few of them may actually be hard to watch for some people. But if you can get past that, this movie will turn out to be a rewarding experience. Oh yeah, and it runs at about two hours and thirty-two minutes. So, it may be a little too long to some people, but it never bothered me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Desert Epic"></head><body><p>Lawrence Of Arabia is one of the biggest and grandest films ever made.  Director David Lean crafted a stunning epic that tells the tale of World War I British soldier T.E. Lawrence.  Lawrence joined the various desert tribes of Arabia against the Turks and the desert battle scenes are breathtaking.  Peter O'Toole is amazing as Lawrence in what would be a star-making turn for him.  Omar Shariff, Anthony Quinn and Alec Guinness provide strong support, but this is Mr. Lean's film through and through.  His direction provides sweeping shots of the desert vistas and gives the film its big look, but he also allows the story to flow and we really get inside the complicated head of Lawrence and see his psychological foibles.  The film is beautifully transferred to DVD and it brings justice to the film that had previously suffered on video transfers.  The movie was a major success as it swept through the 1962 Oscars winning Best Picture and Best Director, but Mr. O'Toole lost out on what would be the first of his of his seven unsuccessful Best Actor nominations.</p></body></html>

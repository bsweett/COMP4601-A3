<meta name="summary" content="Eye-catching alien movie -- no more, no less"></head><body><p>"District 9" is a potentially great film that, unfortunately,  left its brains on the cutting room floor. A massive alien spacecraft is parked, incongruously, above Johannesburg, South Africa. After a suitable period of distant study, the government invades and discovers that the craft is filled with sickly aliens. These are promptly removed to a squalid shanty town, District 9, directly below the ship. There, the aliens prove to be ill-tempered, violence-prone neighbors for the local humans, who agitate to move them out of the city. The film follows a group of government clerks and police who seek to evict the aliens.<br /><br />The first half of the movie was filled with originality and promise. The city-sized, haze-shrouded spacecraft itself was spectacular, and CGI used to render the wasp-waisted, humanoid aliens was near perfect. Watching the South Africans attack the ship using comparatively tiny helicopters went against most films in the aliens genre, which are either filled with peace-loving kewpie dolls or invulnerable mega-warriors. The irony of watching civil servants try to extract signatures from the clicking, grunting, ever-menacing  aliens was delicious and even funny. Wikus Van De Merwe, the civil servant who led the evictions (acted by a suitably sniveling Sharlto Copley) was a narcissistic figure full of his own self-importance who was barely more tolerated by his own people than by the aliens. And the willingness of government officials to inflict torture on their own citizens  in order to procure a desired technological advantage, while undeveloped, was all too believable.<br /><br />The second half of the movie devolved into a sequence of hoary Hollywood clich&eacute;s. There was the unlikely buddy clich&eacute;, on the order of "The Defiant Ones," in which a human and an alien must work together to save themselves. An interminable chase ensues, including a session in which bad guys talk endlessly about how they will hurt our heroes. There are cute kids in danger and unrelenting hunters, etc., etc. In spite of obvious parallels between apartheid-era South Africa's brutal dislocation of blacks and the treatment of the aliens, there was surprisingly little political meat to the movie. Why a film set up this elaborate allegory of man's mistreatment of man, then chose not to pull the trigger, is a mystery that robs the film of its potential for greatness.<br /><br />Watch District 9 for the masterful acting, cool-ish weapons, writing, use of CGI and a few tantalizing good ideas. But alas, don't watch it for anything deeper.</p></body></html>

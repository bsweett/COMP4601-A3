<meta name="summary" content="Guys, Where Are We?"></head><body><p>On the day of the 6th season premiere, I finally decided to watch Lost to cement the fact that I will forever be six years behind or ahead of pop culture. I would have watched sooner, but by the time I wanted to jump on the bandwagon, a lot of my friends jumped off, "It was great for a while, then it just got weird" they'd say. But now, with the final season upon us, and with my hearing that answers will be/have been given, I jumped on the fated Lost plane. Thus, this review will be in the context of a first-time viewer starting from the beginning, so forgive me if these facts are later changed, resolved, or otherwise not true in later seasons.<br /><br />Highlight Episodes:<br />Pilot<br />Walkabout<br />All The Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues<br />Hearts & Minds<br />Deus Ex Machina<br /><br />From the opening moments of death-dog, Vincent waking up our fateful hero, then finding out that a plane has crashed on an island, and the ensuing chaos that follows, Lost comes up with one of the best pilots in TV history. It's absolutely mesmerizing for anybody that watches it. How could you not become a fan after watching this? The beach scene not only has some great special effects, but the tension and feeling of terror on the beach is just so well-done. In fact, this scene is so iconic, every show like it that has come afterwards has tried to come up with their own version of this scene. Guess what, they all fail. What may seem like a simple scene, is actually an encapsulation of all that makes Lost a great show, at least in the first season.<br /><br />Another aspect of Lost that the show does so well, is that while it's most known for its story, it's characters hold the show together, and it's mostly what makes the characters so good. It's so hard to get to know so many people since it's an ensemble cast, but by the end of the season, you get a good sense of most/all of the characters, their motivations, and what brought them to the island.<br /><br />Jack is the reluctant leader who was told all of his life that he didn't have what it takes to be a hero (He's also the first of many characters we learn that has MAJOR daddy issues). Sawyer is the local conman, unlikable maybe, but he gives clever nicknames, so he can't be all bad. Locke is the local philosopher, always the wiser, he struggles with issues of faith. Sayid is the local Iraqi torturer. Hurley is the comical fat guy with a heart of gold and a harsh unlucky streak. Jin & Sun are the local Koreans that are surrounded by emotional and linguistic barriers. Charlie is the local drug-addicted former rockstar that finds a new addiction in the pregnant/sweet/cute Claire. Boone & Shannon are the high-class step-brother & sister that slept together. Michael & Walt are a father & son that struggle to build their relationship. And even though Kate is often criticized for being the worst character/actress, she's a tragic type who's built by circumstances, and only suffers because she's the least likable out of the whole cast.<br /><br />To build out and flesh out that big of a cast in only 25 episodes is an amazing accomplishment to me, especially since a lot of it comes in the form of well-placed flashbacks. And again, in this season at least, Lost puts its characters above its story. Sure, it may string you along with a few mysteries, Lost Season 1 was all about the characters. This is where Lost succeeds, and for me at least, makes it such a compelling watch.<br /><br />Overall, it's a must that you at least try the show out at least thought the pilot, and probably through episode 4 or 5. If you're not satisfied by this point, then you'll probably never be satisfied, and if you continue and make it through the whole season and you still don't like it, then just drop it. This is the best that Lost has offered so far, and to me, it's a TV gem.<br /><br />Also, if you've already seen this season, after you've seen the whole show, I hear it's equally comelling and facinating the 2nd time around. Which is always great when a show stands up to, and even benefits from repeat viewings.</p></body></html>

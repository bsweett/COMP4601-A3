This time around, we know her name - Alice.  In "Apocalypse," the deadly T-virus has escaped from the underground laboratory known as the Hive and threatens to destroy an entire metropolis, Raccoon City.  Alice has been injected with the T-virus and has become a mutated super hero.  She leads a handful of survivors in search of a scientist's lost daughter.  The scientist has promised to airlift them to safety before a nuclear bomb destroys Raccoon City.  Like the original "Resident Evil," this sequel is a science fiction/horror hybrid with non-stop action.  Instead of an underground lab, an entire city has been infected with the T-virus.  There are a thousand more zombies, killer dobermans, and hideoulsy mutated creatures that must be fought by a gorgeous cast of young actors/actresses.  A powerful rock-n-roll score accentuates the numerous action sequences.  While watching this movie, Euro horror fans will think of Lamberto Bava's "Demons" and "Demons 2" in which everyone is turning into hideous demons in lieu of zombies.  Favorite scene in "Apocalypse:"  When Alice crashes her motorcycle through a church's stained glass windown and battles the mutated creatures.  A very strong sequel that rivals the original, "Apocalypse" is an apocalyptic disaster movie.  If you own the original, you must own "Apocalypse."</p></body></html>

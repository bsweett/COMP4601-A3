<meta name="summary" content="Master and Commander"></head><body><p>`Master and Commander', for me at least, is one of those films that surprises you by how good it turns out to be. I wasn't expecting to be gripped and captivated as much as I was. This is set during the Napoleonic wars and follows an English ship as it is chased and as it chases a French warship of superior size and strength. This basic premise may seem rather staid, but this has so much tension, as the cat and mouse game is played out, that the just over two hour duration goes by in the blink of an eye.<br /><br />This conjures up the tensions, fears and excitements of life on the high seas and offers a fascinating look at life onboard one of these ships, from the captains table to the men on deck. You will enjoy the rough camaraderie and carousing amongst the crew, as well as the superstitions and cabin fever long stretches at sea engenders.<br /><br />This film is shot very well and you are quickly pitched into the cramped and close quarters of life onboard. You see how the men live and fight and the hierarchy onboard as well. All the accents are `most frightfully British' and whilst it seemed mildly annoying at the start, it very quickly adds to the atmosphere of the film. Crow acts surprisingly well in this film and you can feel his charisma and drive as a captain throughout. This is a good old fashioned adventure film and left me on the edge of my seat and moved by the end. Well worth checking out at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

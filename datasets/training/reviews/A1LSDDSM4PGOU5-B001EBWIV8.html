<meta name="summary" content="random and incoherent"></head><body><p>this is the second movie in the Matrix saga.it chronicles the<br />continuing fight of the resistance to free humanity from continuing<br />enslavement from the machines which keep reality hidden from them.this<br />is not what i would call good movie.it is a collection of repetitive<br />and ridiculous unrealistic fight scenes,coupled with an incoherent<br />storyline.plus there a lot of 'profound' sayings which aren't really<br />profound at all.then you have characters speaking in riddles which are<br />gibberish half the time.at time,i felt i was being preached a<br />philosophy lesson.My vote for The Matrix Reloaded is a 2/5</p></body></html>

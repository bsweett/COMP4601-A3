As always, Jack Sparrow navigates the straits between the straight-laced royal military, the villains mor evillainous than he is, and the supernatural forces that he seems to take for granted so casually. Chemistry with Pen&eacute;lope Cruz works well, but lacks some of the spark he had with Keira Knightley. Effects work beautifully, even if a few seem not to have been thought through fully. (That aquarium full of water would have weighed what? And would have taken how many to carry it?) The romance between two side characters adds a sweet touch to the mix, too.<br /><br />This isn't the first "summer movie" of this summer season, but it sets the bar high for the ones that follow.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters</p></body></html>

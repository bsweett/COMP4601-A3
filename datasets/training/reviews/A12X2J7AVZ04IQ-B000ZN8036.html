<meta name="summary" content="Sean Penn succeeds; Fascinating study"></head><body><p>Even at 2? hours, this film commands attention, thanks largely to the care and vision of director/screenwriter Sean Penn. Despite his checkered past in Hollywood (bad-boy image, married to Madonna, etc.), I've been a fan since his directorial debut, "The Indian Runner", introducing the world to Viggo Mortenson. Smart move; great film. There is little I can say that hasn't been said. The episodic nature of the narrative is a good thing; Mr. McCandless certainly found the adventure he was seeking, and his reflections and flashbacks fill in most of the holes. It's brilliantly acted, and the top-notch cast, most relegated to short screen time, fulfill the requirements. Most impressive of all is the focused, centered and determined performance of Emile Hirsch. There's not a glitch in the committment of his character. His resemblance to Leo di Caprio is profound. Certainly, everyone thinks, at one time, to get away from it all. Mr. McCandless certainly had that idea, and ran with it. Unfortunately, it wasn't well imagined for him,  and his dream was not fruitful.Some might think that re-imagining yourself would be productive, but there are too many factors involved that must be considered: love, memories, friends, accountability; it's presented well, and non-judgmental. A true adventure; alas, no heroes.</p></body></html>

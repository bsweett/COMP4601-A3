Despite his best efforts, Kimball finds himself convicted for murder and facing wrongful punishment by the law.<br /><br />Not willing to let his wife's murder escape jsutice, Kimball stages a daring escape from a train heading towards a state penitentiary (one of the greatest scenes ever), and becomes the most wanted man in the state.<br /><br />Put in charge of apprehending him is no-nonsense U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard, who is determined to bring Kimball to justice.<br /><br />This begins a tense game of cat and mouse that never lets up.

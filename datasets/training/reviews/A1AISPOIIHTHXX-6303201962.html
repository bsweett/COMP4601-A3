<meta name="summary" content="The best Star Trek? Possibly. A good Star Trek? Yep."></head><body><p>Oddly enough I have not seen a single original series Star Trek episode. I've heard the classic Kirk vs. Spock music and know the character names but never actually watched an episode. Same thing with the other series although I have watched all the Next Generation films. So on a whim and since everyone says II is the best, I blind bought and it was a good purchase.<br /><br />Apparently(like I said, didn't watch original series), Captain Kirk banished genetically engineered Khan to a desolate planet for 15 years. A little snafu accident with Chekov and his new ship's captain finds himself face to face with Khan. His plan? Why revenge of course. Using mind control bugs he takes over the ship and surprise attacks the Enterprise leaving it a bit crippled.<br /><br />Turns out there's another thing Khan wants: the Genesis program, which can actually create life on lifeless planets. It has the reverse effect on life already there: it destroys it so the new life can thrive. Perfect annihilation weapon, no? So Captain Kirk and his crew, including new recruit Saavik(and also film newcomer Kirstie Alley of Cheers fame).<br /><br />What makes II work is that it's quite action packed. It builds up slowly until Khan takes over the ship then the fight begins. It's the 80's so everything was pre CG with motion control shots and cloud tank effects for the nebula at the end but you wouldn't care anyways. Also a quite significant event happens at the end and it's handled particularly well.<br /><br />As for acting, everyone is of course top notch in their character. No Oscar caliber but come on, we're just happy Spock acts like Spock right? Known for...his...overracting...and...pause-y speech, William Shatner is quite a surprise on here especially his infamous "KHHHAANNN!".<br /><br />I'm kind of torn between this film and First Contact as the best Star Trek(Granted I've only seen 7-10 and this) but so far it's definately up there as the best Trek adventure.</p></body></html>

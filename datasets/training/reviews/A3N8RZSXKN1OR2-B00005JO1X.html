<meta name="summary" content="A wonderful adaptation!"></head><body><p>This almost-epic-length film is far superior to the TV version of a few years ago, as we might expect given the rapid development of SFX technology.  It's also an almost exact copy of the classic book, with only a few scenes (not very vital) left out.  By now probably everyone knows the story: the four Pevensy children are sent away from London during the Blitz and end up at a rambling old country house inhabited by aged Prof. Kirke and his housekeeper; youngest Lucy inadvertantly blunders into the magical land of Narnia by way of a magical wardrobe and is befriended by a faun named Tumnus, tries to convince her sister and brothers of the reality of her experience, is followed in a second time by Edmund (who meets the infamous White Witch, self-proclaimed Queen of Narnia, and is tricked into becoming her agent), and a third time by all three of them; they discover that Tumnus has been arrested by the Queen's Secret Police (wolves), are befriended by a pair of talking Beavers, learn that they are the foretold saviors of the land, and after extended trails (and Edmund's temporary defection) finally meet and make common cause with Aslan, the great Lion, who has assembled an army for them to lead against the Witch and her partisans.<br /><br />Of course if you've read the book you know ahead of time how it's all going to turn out, and the real enjoyment comes from seeing how the scriptwriters and director have translated the story to film and how the SFX department has made the magic of Narnia come alive.  I don't think I've seen better effects since the first chapter of "Star Wars" burst upon an astounded world 30 years ago.  Even though you know that the creatures of Narnia are computer-generated, they seem so lifelike that you root for the good ones and (mentally) hiss the bad guys: standouts include Aslan (of course), whose facial expressions haven't been equalled by an effects-created creature since "Dragonheart," the centaurs in his army (one of whom serves as Peter Pevensy's second-in-command), and the Witch's force, a wonderfully-imagined stew of ugliness including her General, who appears to be a Minotaur.  There are even cheetahs in the good army and tigers in the evil one whose movements are completely true to what you've seen in nature films.  The climactic battle (which was apparently filmed in New Zealand) is absolutely unforgettable, including a clashing, crashing confrontation between Peter and the Witch, the latter armed with not one but two swords and swinging them around like broomsticks.  (And the music that plays under the action makes you want to rush right out and get the soundtrack CD.)  And, as has been mentioned by another reviewer, just when you think the story has ended and the credits have started to roll, there's a little surprise that isn't in the book but looks forward to revelations of a later volume in the series.  (Recently while at my local theater to see another flick, I noticed a poster for a forthcoming release of "Prince Caspian," the second book in the Chronicles, so it looks as if we can hope to see all seven adapted to film in the next few years.)  Well-paced, splendidly visualized, and just scary enough to give youngsters some delicious thrills (and maybe, admittedly, a nightmare or two), this is DVD that should be in everyone's permanent collection; it's definitely going to join mine.</p></body></html>

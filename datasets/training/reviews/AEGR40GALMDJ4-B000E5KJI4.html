<meta name="summary" content="The Best Movie of 2004 so far."></head><body><p>The best movie of 2004 yet, and one of the best epics ever.  Everything about the movie was on a grand scale.  The acting, the score, the special effects, everything.  This is definately one of Brad Pitt's best performances, as with the rest of the cast.  It was deep, tragic, and even if you know the story it is still very very entertaining.  It is definately a must see movie, spend your money on it, it is worth it.  I highly reccomend this film.</p></body></html>

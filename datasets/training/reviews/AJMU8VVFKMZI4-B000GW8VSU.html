However, the battle of mothers will definitely go to Angela Lansbury over Meryl.  Not that Meryl did a bad job, it's just Angela was outstanding.  This movie filled in a little more holes for me-though I find the overall premises still far fetched and the ending wholly unbelivable.  Still-a good rental.</p></body></html>

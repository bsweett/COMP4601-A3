This film was simply aweful, and I don't say that often about films, as I usually find something good to say about the films I watch, because I am very particular to the films I'm interested in.  Subject material (or genre) is usually the only criteria I care about.  If I'm interested in the subject material, I'll check out the film.  I generally like sci-fi and/or apocalyptic films, so I checked this out because this film was billed as the "new Millenium's 'Blade Runner'".  Hogwash.  The only thing that would make this in the vein of "Blade Runner" would be the noir dystopia post-apocalyptic setting.  If you've seen the TV series "Dark Angel", you get the gist of the environment this is set in.<br /><br />However, here's the deal with this film (and story).  Instead of Blade Runner's Replicants, this story deals with the infertilization of human kind and then the sudden miracle of a illegal immigrant being pregnant and then giving birth.  Of course the police state is very fascist, and the heroes need to smuggle this woman and her baby to some sort of human experimental organization.<br /><br />The film is only 110 minutes long and only 10-15 minutes of the film near the end is worth watching.  The action scene in the streets and buildings of a bombed out city block or two.  But that's not what really ticked me off about the film.  Believe it or not, it's one of the extras on the DVD.  The 27 minute featurette "The Possibility of Hope."  This featurette features about every prominent European leftist telling the viewer just how bad and evil individualism, globalization, capitalism, and ownership of personal property is.  One of the main speakers is a "Philosophy and Culture critic".  Now if that don't tell you something, nothing will.  Someone paid to come up with and say anything and everything about how bad humanity is.  It was a disgusting piece to put on a DVD as an extra.  Even though it supposedly tied into the film somewhat, the piece was totally one-sided.  That's propaganda folks...and I ain't buyin'.  Not one voice of dissent in the piece.  They basically blamed every ill that plagues mankind (and on the earth, ie. global warming)...on mankind.  I couldn't hardly watch it...in fact, I didn't.  I just let it play in the background as I did something else.  This kind of thing happened once before with a DVD release.  The Running Man-SE had a left-wing hit piece on it that dealt with something, I can't even remember what, but it featured Ramsey Clark, one of America's most infamous America-haters, who takes the side of America's enemies every chance he gets.<br /><br />I'm gonna say right now to all these DVD companies, if you're going to put a featurette or documentary on a DVD that has political referrences, you better make it "fair and balanced".  DVDs aren't the place for propaganda hit pieces.</p></body></html>

The psycho killer "Sugar" is so bizzare and scary. Tommy Lee Jones is great as the Sheriff who just doesn't understand some of the things that haunt him. Josh Brolin was perfect and I was cheering for him so badly. This may be the one movie where Woody Harrelson doesn't steal the show and every scene he is in. I truly enjoyed every second of this movie and I know I will see it many more times. You gotta see this movie! It keeps you holding your breath from start to end.</p></body></html>

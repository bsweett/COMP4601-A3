<meta name="summary" content="In Good Company"></head><body><p>Dan Foreman (Quaid) is the Sales Director at Sports America magazine.  He is a very good salesman who has built relationships with his customers.  When Sports America is taken over by Worldcom, Dan (and his co-workers) find their world turned on end.  Dan finds himself demoted to "wingman" for the new boss, Carter Duryea (Grace).  26-year old Carter is not a salesman, but he has had success in the business world.  He is in over his head, and must rely on Dan's assistance if he wants any chance to succeed.<br /><br />After seizing an opportunity to come over for dinner at Dan's house, Carter is amazed by the nice life that Dan has put together for himself.  Coming off of a failed marriage, Carter longs for what Dan has, and soon finds himself dating Dan's daughter Alex (Johannson) behind Dan's back.<br /><br />"In Good Company" is a movie about relationships and the business world.  The interaction between Quaid and Grace and Grace and Johannson feels genuine, and that is the main reason that this movie works.  There is nothing too original here story-wise, sometimes grasping at long-time plot devices, but it is the start interaction with each other that makes this movie stand out.  Dennis Quaid gets to be the likeable guy that most see him as in real life, and Topher Grace gets a chance to shine on the big screen as the good-hearted young man that he seems to be in real life.<br /><br />And, while this movie does rely on formula to some extent, director Paul Weitz is gutsy enough to not give any of the characters a clear answer to their problems.  It feels real, and that is why "In Good Company" succeeds.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="4 Stars for the movie--1 star for this DVD edition"></head><body><p>I couldn't figure out why this so called "Collector's Edition" only had one disc.  Special editions usually have two discs, right?  Was it a typo?  No.<br /><br />The ONLY difference between this edition and the regular edition (that is $8 cheaper!) is that there will be a reprinted comic and a special "collectible" comic included.  So collectible that it will be included in the hundreds of thousands of these DVDs produced.  No extra features, no additional content beyong what is in the regular DVD.  The studio is obviously saving all that for another special edition to be released in 6 months (like X-Men 1.5).<br /><br />Unless you're a huge fan of comics, get the regular release and save the money for Superman Returns on November 28th.</p></body></html>

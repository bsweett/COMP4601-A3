<meta name="summary" content="Great Story"></head><body><p>I found the premise to be interesting- the government seizes the home of a woman for failing to pay a $500 business tax, which she never owed in the first place. An Iranian family man legitimatly buys the seized property and plans to sell it at market value, so to turn a hefty profit. The drama becomes tense, as the woman fights to regain the house which she feels is still hers.<br />Kingsly does a fine job as always. The film is well-paced, and well written, albeit a bit overdramatized at parts. It is an interesting film which should cause one to imagine themselves in the protagonists' shoes, and how he would deal with the situations.</p></body></html>

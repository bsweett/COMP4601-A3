It stars Denzel Washington as Eli Gary Oldman as Carnegie & Mila Kunis as Solara. Basically to get straight down to the plot there's this guy named Eli he has the last bible in the world in pot apocalyptic 2043. You have this guy Carnegie who want's the bible for manipulation or power I don't know maybe its best I don't know & leave it up to my imagination. Then a girl Solara joins Eli later on basically that's the plot. I felt there were flaws Denzel Washington Gary Oldman deserved better a better actor to work than Ray "Rome if she want to Stevenson 1 funny thing during an action scene he fired a CGI rocket he did the same thing in Punisher Warzone. Carnegie was a airly weak villain but Gary Oldman did a good with what he was given. Denzel Washington gave a good performance I 've never seen Denzel Washington give a bad 1. I thought it couldn've used more action. There was a cool cameo by Malcom McDowell I wish he he could've been in the movie more. I do kind of like the score. It's definitely worth renting I'll probably buy it too. So pretty good movie I thought.</p></body></html>

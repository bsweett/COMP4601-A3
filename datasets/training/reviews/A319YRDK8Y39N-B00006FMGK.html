<meta name="summary" content="A boring plot hurts what could have been a great Trek film"></head><body><p>Star Trek: Nemesis is definitely not the worst Trek film to date (That distinction would go to Insurrection or Final Frontier). But it's also nowhere near the best. Falling smack dab in the midst of mediocrity, this film is crying to be great but feels like a paint by numbers Van Gough.<p>Centered on the story of a subclass of Romulans gaining control of its council with the intent of taking over the Federation, the film follows the generation crowd at a time of change as second in command Will Riker and his new wife, ship's counselor Deana Troi, ready to leave the crew. It seems like the over-all theme of the film is supposed to be endings and new beginnings, but that bittersweet concept seems lost in the mostly uninteresting Romulan plot line. What is most frustrating though, is while Nemesis is better then the last Trek film, Insurrection, it had potential to be one of the best of the series. Instead the great scenes are hidden behind the tedious plot. Excellent character moments are screaming to get out, but are replaced either by boring plot developments or ill-placed comedic relief.<p>On the flip side, the special effects are probably some of the best Trek effects yet. But as is becoming more and more evident in modern film, effects don't make a good movie. There are also some fun cameos early on in during what is probably the best scene. In fact, the first fifteen minutes of the movie seemed like it was headed in the right direction. But that was all before the plot took a death grip on it.<p>If Nemesis' story could be related to any other Trek film, it would be that of The Wrath of Kahn, with its similar plot and structure. But this latest seems to be only a pale imitation of Kahn's brilliance. Definitely worth skipping until the video is released, except for the die-hard Trekkies.</p></body></html>

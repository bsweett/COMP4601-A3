<meta name="summary" content="Do Fries Go With That Blake?"></head><body><p>...this is a moderately entertaining upgrade of the Michael Mann cinema Manhunter with THE Hannibal Lector, Anthony Hopkins, pre-queling his role. Fiennes as Dolohyde does an adequate job. Edward Norton should have never done that Death to Smoochy movie and this within a three year span...I couldn't get him out of that purple rhino suit. In the Manhunter movie the detective was made to be a bit on the psychic side. You don't get this here. Nevertheless, it is a good movie, but not of the excellence exhibited in SOTL or, in hindsight now, Hannibal. Hannibal now is up a coupla notches because of this in my opinion...A Note:  Why are all serial killers obsessed with classical literature or art? Or a parent or grandparent beat the crap out of him? I ask only rhetorically. There needs to be a new serial killer paradigm...and quickly. Also, Frankie Faison should have never been put in all three movies because his weight fluctated...A LOT..he was relatively more thin in SOTL...(that's just one of those odd things I notice.)</p></body></html>

The story in itself is simple enough, a man from the future comes back to save a woman who will give birth to the man who will save the future.  But a cyborg has also been sent back to kill the woman to prevent mankind from defeating the machines.  This is a perfect role for Arnold.  Cold emotionless and intimidating.  It is his only true villian role in the movies.  This is for the collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Bourne Controversy"></head><body><p>It seems as though this film/DVD has as many detractors as fans. The principal reason seems to be its faithlessness to the decades-old Robert Ludlum novel. Well, I believe Ludlum was an executive producer of the film, and think that he helped migrate the book into a slick script, which provides plenty of screen satisfaction.<p>At last, someone got the idea, that of an amnesiac spy, to the screen, as the first in what was a book trilogy, and will hopefully produce at least one movie sequel. A lukewarm version of "Identity" played on television years ago (think of the results if it starred Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith!). This version stylishly updates the story to today.<p>I felt that I saw another dimension to talented actor Matt Damon as the action anti-hero of the film, and thought his onscreen chemistry with Franka Potente worked brilliantly. Couple it with a fine performance from Chris Cooper, a jolting assassination, and one of the finest chase sequences I've seen on film....its a winner!<p>The DVD features are somewhat average, although anything filmed this slickly has a lot of interesting background material. The alternate ending was very disappointing.<p>All in all, definitely worth a watch!!!</p></body></html>

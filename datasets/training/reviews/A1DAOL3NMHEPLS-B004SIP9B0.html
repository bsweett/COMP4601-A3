<meta name="summary" content="4.5 Stars is about right"></head><body><p>A beautifully produced reconstruction of events during the week following Diana Spencer's unexpected death: the public mourning, the Royal Family's cluelessness, and Tony Blair's attempts to curry favor with all involved. Helen Mirren deservedly won the 2006 Oscar for best performance by an actress, and the rest of the cast turns in creditable performances as well. I'd give this 4.5 stars if that were allowed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A decent popcorn flick"></head><body><p>"Sahara" is the film adaptation of Cussler's mildly-successful book "Sahara," based on the adventures of Dirk Pitt, a poor man's James Bond who goes through life one adventure at a time and always seems to find some long lost treasure at the end of the book.  As a stand-alone film, "Sahara" is a lot like "National Treasure" and "The Mummy." It can be very cheesy and there are way to many coincidences (Pitt wanders through the Saharan Desert and just happens to come up on Eva getting attacked a second time), but if you can suspend your disbelief, you will probably enjoy it as an entertaining popcorn-flick.<br /><br />If you're a Clive Cussler fan you may have problems though. I can understand why Cussler did not want to be associated with this film.  It is only loosely based on his book.  Of course films always have to change books when doing film adaptations, but only a few of the main ideas were kept for the film, and the biggest flaw is that the characters of Pitt and Giordino were horribly mis-cast.  Pitt is supposed to be an "ordinary-looking" man, not People Magazine's Sexiest Man of the Year.  McConaughey comes across too much like a stereotypical surfer-Keanu Reeves type.  Al Giordino appears to be changed into the bumbling idiot sidekick, a role very similar to the sidekicks in "National Treasure" and "The Mummy."  The only other major flaw with the film is the soundtrack, which sounds like it was thrown together by the staff of the Today Show and is a weird mix of classic rock songs that don't seem to make much sense (eg, Pitt and Giordino are driving down the Niger river in their boat and the movie blasts into Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Alabama" for no reason.)<br /><br />Overall, if you're a big Cussler fan and you're approaching this film as your chance to see one of your favorite protagonists realized on screen, you will be disappointed.  However if you're watching Sahara as a mindless way to kill two hours, it's not too bad of a film, and will likely keep you entertained.</p></body></html>

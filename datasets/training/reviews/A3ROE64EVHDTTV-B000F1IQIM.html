These are probably the best shoot-outs in the entire Mexico trilogy.<br />*Still well-filmed and well-edited.<br />*Great writing.<br />*Good acting; interesting characters.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Storyline is pretty convoluted, and can be hard to follow.<br />*There are so many characters in this movie that it can be hard to remember who's who and what they want and so on.<br /><br />The Other Things<br />*The film is mostly in English, with subtitles for Spanish-speaking parts.<br /><br />Although this doesn't quite outdo "Desperado" or even the original "El Mariachi," "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" is wildly entertaining.  The action scenes are its greatest strength, for they are bigger (almost epic in scale) and great fun to watch.  The characters are great, even if there are dozens of them.  The only thing that really suffers is the story, which can be difficult to comprehend.  Still, most action movie fans will like this.</p></body></html>

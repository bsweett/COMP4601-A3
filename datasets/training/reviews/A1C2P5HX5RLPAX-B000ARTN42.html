<meta name="summary" content="Intense and Wonderfully Shot"></head><body><p>I thoroughly enjoyed this story about a noble underdog from New Jersey who re-establishes his reign in the world of boxing after succumbing to the woes of the Great Depression. Russell Crowe always does well in strong character roles with a physical component and this is no exception. It took a bit for me to warm up to Ren&eacute;e Zellweger in the role of Mae, James Braddock's (the Cinderella Man) wife but she was really brilliant and brought me to tears numerous times. Loved her accent. The fighting scenes were intense and wonderfully shot. I especially liked how they transposed an x-ray view into a couple of them when wrists, ribs and noses were broken. Would definitely watch this again. Reviewed by M. E. Wood</p></body></html>

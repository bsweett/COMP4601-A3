<meta name="summary" content="Hard to go wrong with Vaughn"></head><body><p>Hard to go wrong with a movie starring Vince Vaughn and Christopher Walken.  This is a humorous movie with the simple premise contained in the title - two friends (Vaughn and Owen Wilson) base their social life around wedding season.  Of course one has to expect some real romance to come out of it too - otherwise there wouldn't be a movie.<br /><br />Vaughn shows his manic greatness as expected, and carries the movie.  Despite that, the best pieces are in the crashing scenes in the beginning.  Not enough material in that for a two hour movie, and the movie slows down considerably as it extends.  Still a good movie, but not a great one.</p></body></html>

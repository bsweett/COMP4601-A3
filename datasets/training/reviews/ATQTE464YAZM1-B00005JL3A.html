While he is mostly known for his "Living Dead" series, he also has experience with Resident Evil - he directed a Japanese commercial for the first Resident Evil game, and it became pretty popular. However, Romero got in arguments with the producers over the movie, was fired, and the script was rewritten by Paul Andersen. What we got was this - a travesty of a film in general. The story involves things going haywire at "the Hive," an Umbrella Corporation laboratory. A T-Virus escapes the testing laboratory and escapes into the air conditioning, and the security computer ("The Red Queen") responds. I don't understand why it should respond to this, since the T-Virus is spread by touch and not by air. I also wonder why, if that was a concern, there was an air conditioner in the first place. Isn't having an air conditioner in a test lab where you make chemical and biological viruses a bit...stupid? You would also think they would have tougher glass for containers of dangerous chemicals and...oh dear, am I using logic with this movie?<br /><br />A special-ops team working for Umbrella (sorry, no S*T*A*R*S) is sent in to shut the laboratory down. Using a secret entrance, which is a mansion (the mansion is in the film for maybe five minutes), they come across Milla Jovovich's character and her "husband," taking them to the lab. It should also be mentioned that the two were sprayed by a nerve gas to erase their memory for a long time, as activated by the security. At no point is it explained how this was supposed to help in the first place - it is also never explained why a special ops team would take two extra loads on a secret mission when they could just pass them on to a surface security team. The team goes into the lab to turn off the system, and hilarity - I mean - horror ensues.<br /><br />I'd like to first say off that, like "Final Fantasy: Spirits Within" which had little fantasy, there was little horror in this film. The enemy in this film is not really the undead or the biogenetic failures, but the laboratory computer. Uh, pardon me, writers? This is "Resident Evil," not "2001: A Space Odyssey." The only real thing you had to fear from computers in the game was that in the last level you had a timeline before the lab/mansion/city/sewer/whatever blew up. There was no Hal screwing things up for characters.<br /><br />Did I mention the producers stated one of the reasons Romero was fired was because his script was "too zombie-ish?" That'd be like if Peter Jackson's script for "Lord of the Rings" was rejected for being "too fantasy-ish." Zombies take up about ten minutes total in the film. (yes I actually timed it) They appear and then disappear at random moments as if the producers said, "Dang it, I just remembered we promised the fans zombies!"<br /><br />Any way, second thing: I have always abhored Milla Jovovich, and this movie only strengthens my hatred for her as an actress. Look, she can't act, she gets the majority of her roles by sleeping with one of the filmmakers (case in point, "The Messenger"), the only good thing she can do in her films is get naked, (and even then she's about as exciting as a pencil with boobs) and once again...she can't act. I tried counting the amount of facial expressions she had in this film, but could at best get two: prissy and super prissy. Dead body found? Prissy look. Zombies attack? Prissy look. Butter spread on toast? Prissy look. The only purpose she serves here is to be the cute body standing around while helpful characters do meaningful things.<br /><br />Actually, many of the characters are rather useless. The Red Queen tells them that one tiny scratch will turn you into a zombie...but after the female trooper is bitten practically ten times, NO ONE seems to think, "Hey, she's gonna turn into a zombie!" or shows any worry over it.<br /><br />I've only ever heard one good thing about this movie: the gore and death scenes are cool. I have yet to discover why a fantastic film like "Saving Private Ryan" gets poo-pooed for its violence, yet atrocious horror films are praised for the amount of splatter they show. You might argue violence is more necessary in horror films than war movies. People - getting shot by a .50 caliber bullet is by defination NOT a pretty thing. Neither is getting decapitated by an elevator, mind you, but I'm not going to spend two hours watching a demo of make-up affects. If I want to do that, I'll watch a low-budget Japanese horror film.<br /><br />Incidentally, try to guess what the main monster (the big one the characters have to destroy at the end) is. Give up? You guessed the Tyrant right? Wrong. The Licker. Yes, you got that right. A monster you kill in the first five minutes of "Resident Evil 2," and with two shots from a shotgun. Say what you want about the Super Mario Bros movie, at least the main villain wasn't a Koopa Troopa. It's also the ONLY biological monster in the whole film, aside from the zombie dogs in another scene. The film just didn't live up to its monster potential - I remember seeing a scene with flooded water and expecting the zombie sharks from the first game, but was left with nothing. The film just doesn't live up to the game's standards for cool enemies.<br /><br />Don't watch it if you're a Resident Evil fan - the script plays out like someone read the back of a Resident Evil video game box and made a story from that. Don't watch it if you're into horror films, it's not scary and it's got horrible acting and a script that shouldn't have survived pre-production. In fact, just don't watch it at all.</p></body></html>

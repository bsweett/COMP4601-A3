<meta name="summary" content="A fun movie"></head><body><p>This was a rather fun movie, nothing over the top, but it was still fun to watch and try to piece together what was going on.  Matthew does a great job of playing the lead character, all of the actors really did a good job with their characters.  You connected and had fun with them as they went.<br /><br />Some of the action was just too much of a stretch, but that is part of watching a action movie, to suspend reality to have fun.  I'm still plagued with the question, why was the iron_clad in Africa in the first place?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Midnight showings are nice....."></head><body><p>After having seen the midnight showing in my town, and having mulled over in my mind what I thought about the film, I have this to say one simple statement.  I liked it.<br /><br />Yes, many purist fans will shirk at the lack of depth in some of the new characters introduced; however, all in all the film did what so many films fail to do these days, entertain throughout.<br /><br />Just to give a little initial background plot, as you probably know by now a lot of the focus is on Jean and the Phoenix.  Well, actually a ton of the movie focuses on this, and not giving anything away, but basically all the climactic events deal with Jean/The Phoenix.  Intriguingly enough though, she's given a very small role at least as far as speaking goes.<br /><br />Instead, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry) take the lead roles, as they advance their characters slightly in depth, but heavily in status.  Don't worry though if if you want and expected fresh faces, because the filmmakers also leave plenty of time for looking at, but not learning about, the newcomers.  Also to mention, the youngest X-Men Rogue, Bobby (Iceman), and Kitty have somewhat of a sub-plot love triangle.<br /><br />Back to the plot though, because all those characters center on the story that a supposed-cure has been released for mutant hood.  This is obviously a very divisive issue, as it widens Magneto and Xavier separation even more, while threatening the already fragile make-up of the X-men themselves.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the movie did have some flaws, as it seemed to want to provide too much in too short a time, while having to glaze over any kind of legitimate character development, (except for some for the Phoenix).  Still, if you were a fan of the old ones, or just like good, entertaining superhero-type films, then you're sure to like X3.</p></body></html>

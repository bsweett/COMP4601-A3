<meta name="summary" content="V for Vendetta"></head><body><p>In the England of 2020, dictator Adam Sutler (Hurt) rules with an iron fist.  Citizens live in fear of him and his regime.  One man who stands against him in a mysterious figure that goes by the name "V" (Weaving).  Hidden behind a Guy Fawkes mask, he seeks to inspire the people.  Evey (Portman) is saved by V one night when she is backed into a corner by Sutler's men.  Then he invites her to a viewing of a "performance" that he has arranged...the blowing up of the Old Bailey.  He gives the government one year before he goes after parliament, and asks the citizens to stand up with him.<br /><br />"V for Vendetta" is an interesting enough movie that is an attempt to not so subtly mirror current events.  This is somewhat of a mistake, as it will alienate some of the audience.  Also, the hero is a terrorist, who resorts to torture of an innocent to further his goals.  Weaving does a good job as V, especially since you do not see his face throughout the entire movie.  Portman does a passable job as Evie, but is nothing spectacular.  "V" will give the viewer something to think about, and is not your standard comic book movie.  This is definately one of the better movies to come out so far this year though, and that may be reason enough to see it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of 007's Best Adventures..."></head><body><p>Some things just get better and better with age, examples would be wine, legends, rare trinkets, and even some movie franchises.  One movie franchise that would be a prime example of this statement would have to be the `James Bond' franchise.  After 19 movies, technically 20 if you count Sean Connery's final appearance in "Never Say Never Again" which occurs somewhat outside of the recognized 007 continuity.  In 2002 MGM went back to the well that just keeps on giving for what turns out to be the final appearance of Pierce Brosnan as the suave secret agent in "007:  Die Another Day".<br /><br />When one of his mission's gets sabotaged, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) finds himself in a rare predicament, captured and tortured for an extended period of time, and to top things off it appears that MI-6 has completely abandoned their top agent.  After M (Judi Dench) finally secures the release of 007, by swapping him for another prisoner, Bond uses his renewed freedom not to relax and heal, but to seek revenge on those that betrayed him.  Upon his reinstatement in the ranks of MI-6, Bond is given a chaperone to ensure that he cause as minimal trouble as possible.  Knowing that this chaperone will slow him down, Bond eventually strikes out on his own once again and follows his leads to the source of his betrayal.  With the help of an American spy (Halle Berry), Bond discovers that the person responsible for his mission's sabotage is a multi-billionaire whose business is diamonds; however, that is just a cover as his true business is that of terrorism as he is now in the possession of a devastingly powerful new weapon that could bring the world's superpowers to their knees.<br /><br />After 21 total `James Bond' films in the franchise, one would think that there would really be nothing new the filmmakers could come up with.  Well, sometimes it's really nice to be surprised, because with "007:  Die Another Day" not only did the writers and the director, Lee Tamahori (director of "xXx:  State of the Union") deliver what could very well be one of the greatest `James Bond' adventures yet, but Pierce Brosnan also delivered his most powerful performance as the capable-as-ever Agent 007.  Sadly, as I stated earlier, this terrific entry into the franchise also served as the final appearance of Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.  The reason this was Brosnan's final appearance isn't because he died or quit, it's because the producers of the franchise felt he no longer fit the part.  While I understand their reasoning to an extent, Brosnan was starting to show his age, and he did go out with one of the best installments in the long-lasting franchise.  But I would have liked to have seen him as Bond again, mostly because between him and Connery, they are the only two actors that I feel portrayed the character the best.  Anyways, back to the task at hand, other factors that assisted in making this one of the best `Bond' films ever is the raw emotions that are evoked throughout the story, the entire cast really did an amazing job, and the dramatic side of the story was well-paced, and the action served to propel the story for a change.  Another asset would have to be the perfectly cast Halle Berry as the new scantily clad, incredibly sexy Bond girl.  She is definitely enough to make any secret agent let all his secrets spill out.  Not to dote solely on Halle, the entire cast was excellent, and John Cleese as the new `Q' is just hilarious without being over the top or out of place in this franchise.<br /><br />Well, as I've said numerous times in this review, this terrific entry into the `James Bond' franchise is definitely not one to be missed, especially by any of the fans of the series.  If you haven't ever gotten much out of this series of films, you should really give the franchise another chance, and make "007:  Die Another Day" one of the first on your list to see.<br /><br />"007:  Die Another Day" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sexuality.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great crime drama"></head><body><p>A crew of criminals rip off a diamond merchant.  The cops intervene far more quickly than seems natural.  Were the robbers set up?  That's the question left for the survivors to puzzle out as they rendezvous back at their meeting place.<br /><br />Writer/director Quentin Tarentino has clearly learned the lesson that a basic, straightforward narrative gains intrinsic interest from a skilled skewing of narrative.  What seems like an uncomplicated crime story gains new and unexpected levels because Tarentino chooses to shoot events in an unconventional order, often producing surprising juxtapositions.

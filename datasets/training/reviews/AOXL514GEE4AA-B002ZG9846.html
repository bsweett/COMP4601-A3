Blu-ray review."></head><body><p>Dave Lizewski (Johnson) can't help but wonder "Why has no one tried to become a superhero?" As a comic-book nut he decides to take his passion to the next level and become a real-life superhero. His journey begins where else, EBay! What do you expect when you are a high school dork with only a $200 budget? His next step, a name...Kick-Ass or as Big Daddy (Cage) says "more like Ass-Kick"! Of course Kick-Ass has no powers, no skills, no smarts and no cool gadgets but he still inspires NY'ers once his beating by 3 thugs becomes viral on YouTube. His life is now changed by having his own comic book and copy cats. It all seems pretty cool, until he is implicated as the vigilante that is taking down D'Amico's (Strong) drug empire! Now, he is hunted by violent criminals and meets up with a pair of real crazed vigilantes, including an 11-year-old weapons wielding dynamo, Hit Girl (Moretz) and her father, Big Daddy. Kick-Ass eventually learns that the duo have their own score to settle with D'Amico. As obsession turns into madness, Kick-Ass is forced to become a real hero or die!<br /><br />Kudos to everyone involved on this project (both the comic and the film)! Millar's story and Romita's drawings inspired Matt Vaughn's vision and the result is a cult classic that will be loved by comic fanboys and it's own subculture for decades. The true star of this movie is Hit-Girl played amazingly by Chloe Moretz. She absolutely steals the show. Fans of Leon the Professional will immediately pick up the relationship with Moretz and Cage as it is similar to Portman and Reno. The film is dark and although there is comedy, it can be uncomfortable. Ultimately, once the "Ass-Kickin'" starts, you will be cheering with every dead bad guy! A must see.<br /><br />BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: A beautiful picture with outstanding sound. The colors pop and the blacks are rich. Blu-ray has made the home theatre experience so much better. SPECIAL FEATURES: Fantastic, although I would have loved deleted scenes. The two best features are long and include a making of and the origins of the comic book. FINAL THOUGHTS: I loved this movie. Comic book fans will jump all over it. Blu ray collectors should add this as well. Casual fans? Once you see it, you will love it too. A MUST OWN!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Average Comedy: What's New?"></head><body><p>Seems like you have to look hard to find a funny movie these days. The Longest Yard fails at being funny mainly because it tries too hard to be like many other sports comedies. It seems to use the same type of jokes over and over again (one liners and overuse of profanity for instance), and the same formulaic and predictable elements that you would find in any Adam Sandler movie.<br /><br />The characters are all typical prototypes. For instance, you have the corrupt warden of the prison who tries to get Adam Sandler's character to form a team that will seemingly be doomed. You have the big dumb guy who just likes to hit people, but wants to play. You have the fat guy who just wants to be a part of the team, and is the source of several jokes. You have the sidekick(Chris Rock) who knows everything about the prison, and is a willing participant to help Sandler's character out. You have Adam Sandler being the washed up athlete with a snobby girlfriend. You have Adam Sandler trying to turn a bunch of less-than-average football players into winners. You have the corrupt guards who try to bully some of the inmates, etc.<br /><br />It also doesn't help this movie to see cameos by the least respected sports personalities (such as Micheal Irvin and Bill Romanowski). I mean, I know it is suppose to be a tasteless comedy, but sheesh!<br /><br />There are certain funny points, sure, but this is a forgetable movie, and there are better and funnier Adam Sandler movies out there (Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer come to mind). I happened to go see this one at the show, but, in hindsight, I would have been better off waiting for this one for rental.<br /><br />Rating: 2 1/2 stars</p></body></html>

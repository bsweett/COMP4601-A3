<meta name="summary" content="A terrific performance sparks this film!"></head><body><p>MONSTER is an admirable movie, in the way that it makes our loyalties shift from character to character.  We are introduced right away to Aileen (Lee) [played by Charlize Theron...more on her later], the soon-to-be first ever female serial killer.  She is unattractive in a way that says "I feel ugly on the inside, and that has bled into the outside," rather than, "Because I was ugly outside, my soul has become ugly too."  She is, quite obviously, rotten at the core.  She goes into a bar, mostly to escape the elements, and finds she is in a gay bar, and there she meets the character played by Christina Ricci, who is a not-quite-out-of-the-closet lesbian, making some very shy forays into the gay world. She is unattractively dressed and wearing a huge cast on her arm, so her desparation to connect makes her even more unappealing to the more happy-go-lucky crowd around.  She and Lee connect though, and a "torrid" affair develops.<p>At first, Ricci (who lives in a tiny bedroom in the ultra-religious home of some family relatives she's been shipped off to) and Lee are a "happy" couple...crazy and irresponsible, but so glad to have made a connection with another human being and not to be found repulsive.  But soon, we see some ugliness coming out...unexpectedly, it comes from Ricci.  She is fascinated that Lee is a prostitute, and when Lee makes a (sad) effort to "go straight," we are dismayed to see that Ricci seems to want Lee to continue her life as a prostitute.<p>Then Lee (whom we have come to feel very sorry for at this point) is brutally attacked by a customer. She fights back and kills the man.  At this point, we are ready to cheer.  She is empowered and certainly seems to be within her rights to shoot the guy.  But when she returns to Ricci with the man's car, Ricci's greed comes out even more, and their love for each other begins to curdle.<p>Lee begins to kill for less and less "admirable" reasons, and by the end of her spree, our feelings have flip-flopped for her.  <p>The movie is frank and brutal.  In the crowd I saw it in, there were plenty of shocked gasps...not from gore, but from the cold natured brutality.  Somehow, low-budget movies just make the grittiness of violent death feel more REAL.  Death  Be Not Proud, the quote goes, and it certainly isn't in this film!  <p>Yet underneath it, the movie is still structured something like a predicatable TV movie.  Cleaned up just a little and cast with a TV star instead of a movie star, and you could have a "movie of the week." Ultimately, the movie doesn't really have anything big or new to say.  We see how Lee became a serial killer, but this only sheds illumination on her, not on the world in general.  The story IS fascinating, no question, but at the end, you don't really leave the movie with a big feeling one way or another.<p>Charlize Theron.  She has never been a favorite of mine. She is glamorous, and was okay in films like CIDER HOUSE RULES.  Often, though, she's little more than an adornment to the film, usually attached at the hip to a man.  Here, the male characters are VERY minor, and Theron spends most of her time on screen with Ricci.  Much has been made of her makeup, and it is stellar.  She is pretty much unrecognizable.  And  unlike, for example, Nichole Kidman in THE HOURS (remember the rubber nose?), Theron's makeup  is seamless.  But what she has done here is transformed herself. Her entire posture has been given over to the realities of her character. Not one bit of glamour is there to be found.  It is a brave performance, and one that should make it possible for her to find meatier roles.  But MONSTER'S BALL didn't help Halle Barry get "juicy" roles...just bigger paychecks.  We'll see what Theron's fate is.  I'm not entirely sure she should win the Oscar...as amazing as her performance is, there are some gradations lacking. It begins to feel a little bit predictable by the end.  But if she does win, I won't begrudge her.  <p>But adult movie audiences looking for a unique, engrossing film could do far worse than MONSTER.  It's a trip into a previously unfamiliar world.  Just leave the kids at home!</p></body></html>

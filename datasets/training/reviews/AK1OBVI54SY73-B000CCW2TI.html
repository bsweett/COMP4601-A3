But I liked it enough to buy it and when I did again watch it one night I was blown away by how much more entertaining it was than I gave credit for.<br /><br />Almost right away the movie dives into the plot. Cillian Murphy's character cuts right to the chase about what he wants McAdam's character to do and from then it turns into a fast- paced and satisfying thrill of a ride that doesn't end till the credits.<br /><br />Cillian is just an amazing actor and was perfect for his role and McAdams was great with him. Their dialogue together throughout the films keeps you interested and the ending, although predictable, is also satisfying. The entire movie is short but rather exciting, with two talented actors that fit their roles like a glove, and the plot itself carries well.<br /><br />Overall highly recommended. One of my favorites to watch. 5/5</p></body></html>

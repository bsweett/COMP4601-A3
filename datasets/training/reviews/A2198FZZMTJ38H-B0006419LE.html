<meta name="summary" content="An absolute stunner! One of the great sci-fi films!"></head><body><p>People often ask me what my favorite movies are, which is never an easy question, but what remains even harder is listening to their pondering one of my answers with the question, &quot;Why is that one of them?&quot; Such is the case with &quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; the 1968 classic science fiction film that has become a milestone in moviemaking. As I am not an avid fan of the genre, it bewilders people to learn that such a film ranks so highly in my opinion. But this is no ordinary science fiction film we're talking about, either. <p>Despite numerous sequels, a short-lived television series, and a modern reenvisioning of the film that might as well be a different movie all its own, the first and most appealing &quot;Apes&quot; film captures everything that is great about film in a single two hours of pure, unmitigated brilliance. From its psychedelic opening sequence to the final, hard-hitting shot, the movie works a silent spell on its audience that remains with the mind long after the experience has ended. It's nuanced plot provokes thought and consideration, and its smart sense of reversal is simply stunning. <p>The movie is based on the novel by Pierre Boulle, beginning with astronaut Colonel George Taylor making preparations for a sleep that, to him and the other three members of his crew, will last a few mere hours as their space ship travels thousands of light years into space, leaving Earth behind for a new planet on which to begin a new civilization. They soon find themselves on a barren, seemingly uninhabited planet, with the sole female of the crew deceased and three days supply of food and water for the remaining three astronauts. <p>Their trek across the desert terrain leads them to an oasis, flowing with fresh water and inhabited by humans, who are seized and taken as prisoners by the dominant apes that rule the planet. Taylor is also captured, taken to their colony, where he discovers that apes have taken on the role of Earthly humans, and humans are the lesser species. He makes impressions on all who encounter him, from Dr Zira (Kim Hunter), the animal researcher who is perplexed by his intelligence and speech capabilities, to the high council, whose ignorance causes them extreme fear in the face of the new arrival. <p>But rather than just provide simple answers to the question of where Taylor has landed, the film examines more thought-provoking issues, from the harsh treatment and prejudice of the humans by the apes, to the ways in which science is viewed by the apes, whose government and belief system are much like that of humans on Earth. Dr. Zira and her fiance, Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), provide arguments for the existence of Taylor on their planet that also carry small clues as to what the movie is building up to, while also enforcing the film's theme of ignorance in the assembly's unwillingness to accept their theories.  <p>As we try to decipher the many twists and clues provided us by the characters, the movie is at work diverting us from the big picture, keeping us at bay. Even still, it is the film's final shot that remains the most effective, and sells the film on everything its plot argues. It's a revelation that makes clear all that we have been pondering during the course of the story, but it is also a cold look at the possible future that lies ahead if man continues on his current path. This warning is no less meaningful today as it was then, and it proves that &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; is one of the most effective science fictions films ever made. <p>The casting department scored big points in acquiring Charlton Heston for the lead role. As Taylor, Heston is the actor we have come to know and love, hitting us with a performance full of power and true emotion, something many actors of today fail to possess. Heston successfully conveys the wide variety of emotions needed to pull his character off. <p>It must also be said that this is one of the most visually arresting films ever made. The opening shots just before the craft crashes into the sea are complex and mind-blowing, setting up the tone of unease that will palpitate throughout the film. The setting fits the material entirely, evoking the harshness of the planet with its parched desert and dry, arid appearance. <p>To call &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; a strictly science fiction film is unjust, as there is more to its story. There is a meaningful lesson to be learned from its unfolding events, which carry with them universal truths that will remain recognizable by the future generations who see it. Its production and cast are remarkable, but what remains its most effective aspect is its ability to mystify the audience, leading us to believe one thing until we realize its something entirely different.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The most revolting movie of 2003"></head><body><p>It's been said that women love "The Hours" and men don't. That's a rather simplified analysis. <p>I found this movie to be simply revolting. There wasn't one single woman in the entire movie who didn't annoy me. Meryl Streep's character is a pathetic creature in love with a man who can never love her back. Julianne Moore plays a selfish 1950s housewife who can't see the world beyond her own navel, and Nicole Kidman captured the Oscar for her portrayal of Virginia Wolf, the depressive and ultimately suicidal author. <p>Every one of these women is presented as some kind of victim. None of them is responsible for her own actions and all them spend their time whining. This was an extremely dreary and lightweight movie.</p></body></html>

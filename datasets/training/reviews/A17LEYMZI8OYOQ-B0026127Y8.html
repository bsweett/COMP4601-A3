<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining Action-Thriller"></head><body><p>This is perhaps the best action-thriller to come along since the BOURNE movies.  It has a good, straight-forward plot, characters that we care about and action sequences that may, at times, get a bit "over the top," but never to the point of being ridiculous.<br /><br />Liam Neeson stars as a retired CIA agent, working an occasional security gig, who is forced back into action when his teenage daughter is kidnapped by white slavers while she is visiting Paris with a friend.  Liam knows that he has only 96 hours in which to find the girl before she disappears forever, and the French authorities are no help whatsoever.  In fact, many of them, are corrupt and on the payroll of the kidnappers.<br /><br />Like DEATH WISH, Taken is one of those movies where you actually cheer when Neeson kills one of the bad guys...and he kills a lot of them.<br /><br />The DVD contains both the theatrical and an extended edition.<br /><br />?

Will Smith tries to play the dating doctor but it turns out that he needs some thereapy when he falls for a reporter.  Its all a matter of practicing what you preach.  Some good scenes where Smith's, knowledgeable but shy accountant speaks out especially when confronted with aristocratic snobs.  The speedating scene is amusing as well.  Howver, the movie is sluggish in spots.  Nonetheless the good outweighs the bad.</p></body></html>

I was excited to see Shyamalan tackle a fairy tale.  I mean, Night has hit a slump since `Unbreakable' and for some reason I still flock to his films crossing my fingers and praying he gets his mojo back, but `Lady in the Water' si just further proof that he tries way too hard.  What's sad is that this has so much potential, but Shyamalan was too concerned with making a point (the point being that he can do whatever he wants in this industry) and failed to give the story a solid point.  Add to that a film littered with many other faults and you have a big problem.<br /><br />The first problem is found in the underdeveloped, or maybe it's overdeveloped, story.  The fairy tale that this movie tells, about a sea-nymph or narf who must return to the blue world via `The Great Etlon' only after inspiring a man to write something that will change the face of the world while she contends with creatures called skrunt's who will stop at nothing to kill her, even risking their own lives at the hands of three monkey like guardians is somewhat exhausting.  But Shyamalan didn't stop there.  You have to add to that the fact that there are humans who must help this narf escape the skrunt's.  Each of these humans has a specific title or job.  There has to be a translator, a guardian, a healer and a guild or group of people.<br /><br />With all of this here you may wonder how so much could mean so little, but when each persons role is far from explained it makes it difficult to give it much meaning.  So, for every `overdeveloped' plotline it, in a sense, comes of `underdeveloped' because it just flat out makes no sense.  In a way I feel that this is another attempt on Night's behalf to throw one at his critics.  In the film, as all know, there is a film critic who meets an untimely end, but before that happens he makes a comment about how all films are predictable and that there is no originality in cinema today.  Well, Night is attempting to disprove that by giving us the opposite of what is expected...the only problem is that Night forgot a key element to making any film memorable...it needs to make sense!<br /><br />Now that you've processed all of that, we can move onto the next problem.  This is found in the characters themselves.  They all, every one of them, seem na?ve and childish.  It makes no sense that no one would question the reality of what is going on.  Even Cleveland (Paul Giamatti) who in the first scene of the film says that creatures don't exist, doesn't even question whether or not this girl is just plain delusional.  It baffles me that everyone wants so desperately to believe this whole thing is real, which is not the way any normal person would act...and maybe that's why this apartment building is littered with strange and abnormal people.<br /><br />Another problem is found in the acting.  I normally love Paul Giamatti but here he's somewhat annoying, especially his stuttering which comes off too rehearsed, unnatural and, for lack of a better word, bad.  Bryce Dallas Howard was sensational in `The Village' but here she comes off distant and stagnant.  She lacks the commanding energy she gave to her previous role but she just kind of slips away into the background.  Bob Balaban as that arrogant critic Harry Farber is ridiculously clich&eacute;d, Jeffrey Wright sounds like he's reading cue cards throughout the film and Freddy Rodriguez is pitifully used and abused in a thankless and ridiculous role.  The shock to me was M. Night Shyamalan who to me was the better actor here, and that was something I never expected.  Cindy Cheung was also fine, I mean at least she was funny, and Sarita Choudhury was decent if not underused.<br /><br />When you add these disappointments together it becomes harder and harder to find anything good about this film.  The visuals are stunning in comparison to the horrid makeup and effects in `The Village'.  The skrunts and tree beings look pretty cool, scary even, but even they can't rescue this film from impending disaster.  The real sad thing is that Night had so much promise.  `The Sixth Sense' was one of the best films to come out in the past decade and it gave Night the boost he needed to make a name for himself and garner enough respect to make what he wanted the way he wanted...but sadly that power has been misused.  Instead of capitalizing on his strengths and turning out smart script after smart script, in an essence becoming the go-to guy for a blockbuster he ended up becoming the go-to guy for a international flop.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Extended Cut Gives A New Look"></head><body><p>I bought The Punisher when it originally came out so now I have both the original DVD and its new Extended Cut.<br /><br />As for the film itself, I liked the original but the new extended cut does what it should do. It gives the film a whole new look that was missing before! I won't give it away but it has a new subplot that makes the film make more sense (much like the director's cut of Daredevil) and makes it better in my view!<br /><br />On a personal note, for those that says its nothing but mindless violence and that it has no regard for human life obviously didn't watch the film or read the comics! Yes, there is gory violence but this isn't freakin' Spider-man (though I enjoy that character's movies as well)! The Punisher ISN'T a nice character. I am not married nor do I have children but if my wife and son (along with my extended family) was gunned down in front of my eyes, I don't think I'd have such a positive attitude either. Also, Frank Castle isn't so hellbent that he can't see suffering around him. If that was so, he wouldn't have helped Joan (played by Rebecca Romjin) with that creepy boyfriend of hers or befriend (sort of) Joan and her friends or left the "gift" that he left so on that note, Frank Castle wasn't totally twisted.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the DVD, it has the animated beginning both with the film and seperate. Also, there is a 10 minute short explaining the new extended cut as well as classic Punisher covers from the comics. I would also recommend keeping the original release for the extras (it has some good ones too). Overall, if you can stand the violence that comes, its a good film.</p></body></html>

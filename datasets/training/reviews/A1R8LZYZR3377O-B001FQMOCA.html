If your not watching this on a decent home theatre system you are missing a whole lot.Viewing this I kept waiting for particuler events to happen that never played out. Ring of Fire was not presented as a true focalpoint of Johnny and June's relationship, just bits and pieces of another song being written. It wasn't even discussed between them in the film. Strange. Then they played it uneventfully. Mr. Phoenix had Cash's movements down well but I kept being distracted by predictability. The film is entertaining though and I learned a little more about times and places. Reese Witherspoon is finally playing a role made for her instead of those cheesy supposed comedy "films". Her acting had real believability and she was properly awarded. A Boy Named Sue was not used for the prison singing scenes and I'm not sure why. It was done there, has wide appeal, would capture a new audience and is just a wild song to have witnessed prisoner reaction to.<br /><br />  I wanted to see Johnny Cashes spiritual road expounded upon more but the film ended rather abruptly. The Elvis scenes seemed very forgetable and cheapish. I like Johnny Cash and their was a great deal to the man, but the movie came up missing that critical essence of a very changed deeper person. A trying effort by all though.</p></body></html>

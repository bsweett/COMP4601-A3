<meta name="summary" content=""Love The Art In Yourself, Not Yourself In Art""></head><body><p>And while I probably don't have anything particularly new to say about this, one of the 10 greatest films ever made in the history of motion pictures, I do none the less strongly urge any and all fans of great movies to add this celebration of life to your permanent film collection. Especially now with this crisp deluxe DVD transfer which gloriously captures the rich colors of director Stanley Donen's expert eye.<br /><br />I am not a great fan of musicals per se, but this film is something far more than a simple genre picture. It is a celebration of the creative muse.<br /><br />At the central core of the narrative is the very real lesson to be learned from acting teacher Constantine Stanislavski: "Love the Art in yourself, not yourself in the art." Kelley's "Don Lockwood", Donald O'Connor's "Cosmo Brown" and Debbie Reynolds' "Cathy Seldon" all succeed because of their undying will and love for very art of performing and creating. Comedic villain "Lina Lamont" as portrayed by the excellent Jean Hagen, is undone by her shallow devotion to her own celebrity.<br /><br />The film, besides being one of the most legitimately uplifting and entertaining experiences an audience can ever enjoy (SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a far more effective anti-depressant than any prescription!), also is a historical accurate depiction of the drastic paradigm shift that occurred not only in film, but in acting history as well. The coming of sound brought drastic, and cataclysmic changes in acting technique. No longer could actors, like "Don" and "Lina" do what they always did- "Just add talking". While many folks do (and in many cases, rightfully so) believe that a large part of real acting died with the coming of sound, an entire new industry of Acting training resulted- hence the need for teachers like Stanislavski and others.<br /><br />In fact, this film has been an important part of my high school acting curriculum for several years. It is refreshing to see how big an influence this film has on all ages. Especially teenagers addicted to violent clap trap, big budget exploitation flicks and rap music.<br /><br />The New York vs. Los Angeles acting rivalry. The comical over enunciated vocalization, the purposefully "cheezy" recreated musical numbers ("Beautiful Girls" is classic!) and a very real depiction of how one built an acting career (barrooms to strip clubs to Burlesque to Vaudeville to Broadway to films) are all historical elements that lend the film depth and strength.<br /><br />Gene Kelley, perhaps even more than the great Astaire, was a great artist who combined a fierce alpha mail athleticism to his mastery of all dance styles. Here, he excels in telling stories through not only tap, but ballet and jazz as well. Debbie Reynolds was never better as the innocent yet strong willed ing&eacute;nue. She and Kelley (and along with Cyd Charrise) create a real sexual chemistry. Anyone who is not convinced that dance can not be a substitute for explicit sex needs to see the utter taste and class depicted here.<br /><br />Donald O'Connor steals the show with his rubber face and impeccable timing. O'Connor's dancing is impressive also- especially in the "Moses Supposes" number in which he matches Kelley step for step. His "Make 'Em Laugh" teaches Jim Carrey a thing or two about how to make broad physical comedy appealing and not obnoxious.<br /><br />Ultimately, like all great films and other works of literature, Singin' in the Rain holds up perfectly to repeated viewings. It is a fresh and vibrant the 100th time as it is the first.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="great movie"></head><body><p>This is a great love story for kids. I don't have any kids but I would enjoy watching this movie with them. They made the dead bride so beautiful that it isn't scare for kids. You can see a lot of sad in her so there is no fear. I like the songs they sing in the movie. I like that Victor stuck by his word and wanted to marry the dead girl. Even though his words weren't meant for her. BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL MOVIE!!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Gran Torino" For The Family Set"></head><body><p>A few years ago, I watched the film "Gran Torino" and was completely blown away by director Clint Eastwood's take on themes such as aging, friendship, and coming to terms with one's own life.  However, those who are easily offended (by either harsh language or non-political correctness) would likely not be able to get past those hang-ups, while kids are ruled out altogether.  Thankfully, Pixar's "Up" explores those same themes in a much more family-friendly fashion.<br /><br />Basically, the story centers on Carl Fredricksen, a senior citizen widower who's being cajoled out of his old relic of a house by construction ("progress") on all sides of him.  Instead of going out smoothly, though, Carl decides (being a retired balloon salesman) to fly his home (via a gaggle of helium balloons!) to Paradise Falls, the mystical place that him and his deceased wife Ellie always dreamed of, but never quite realized.  However, there is one hitch in the plan...that being the completely helpless boy scout, Russell, who just happened to be on the wrong porch at the wrong time.  As they make their way towards the falls, Carl and Russell encounter a slew of new characters and challenges, making it truly an adventure in every sense of the word.<br /><br />The first level that this film really works at is with the kiddies...the intended viewers.  There are enough sight gags (involving the rotund Russell and crotchety Carl) and crazy characters (the talking dog "Dug"...squirrel!) to keep their interest the whole runtime.<br /><br />However, on a much deeper level, this film will truly move even the most adult of viewers.  An amazing sequence towards the beginning of the film depicts the marriage (both the ups and the downs) of Carl and Ellie, and really sets up Carl's character development as he is forced to venture out into the world again and bond with young Russell.  With each passing moment (and new adventure), viewers get the feeling that Carl is taking another small step closer to making a clean break from the past and living for the here and now.  The scene where he finally realizes that fact is enough to make your eyes begin to water.<br /><br />Thus, I consider "Up" to be the pinnacle (at least so far) of animated films for its ability to make you laugh, tantalizing your senses, and really draw you into the characters and their successes/struggles.</p></body></html>

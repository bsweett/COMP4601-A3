<meta name="summary" content="The Best Thriller Since Silence of the Lambs"></head><body><p>I have not read Stieg Larsson's trilogy so I can to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo unaware, for the most part, of the story. My wife, who has read the novels, filled in my gaps.  The film grabs and holds your attention from the beginning as the mystery of the forty-year disappearance of Harriet Vanger seems to deepen rather than become resolved.<br /><br />I especially liked the editing where the stories of Mikael Blomkyist and Lisbeth Salander are told, side-by-side, before they become devoted to solving the mystery.  There were parts of the story of Lisbeth - her relationship to her father and mother - that were inexplicable. We see Lisbeth as young girl setting a man on fire in his car without knowing why she is doing this or to whom.  We also don't know why her mother is in a nursing home.  This actually is a critical part of the story for Lisbeth's character and perhaps a few minutes could have been spent relating her troubled past.  For me, this was a small matter compared to the overall excellence of the film.<br /><br />The performance of Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth is something to behold. I can't recall a recent performance that was so mesmerizing. Michael Nygvist is excellent as Blomkyist and he plays well off the darker character of Lisbeth.  Together, Lisbeth and Blomkist make an interesting investigative team as they unravel the depraved Nazi past of members of the Vanger family.  The film is very graphic in the scenes of Lisbeth's rape and her revenge on her "guardian" and in the murders that Lisbeth and Blomkyist uncover on their way to the truth.  Viewers who are sensitive to violence may want to opt out of viewing the film.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is well acted and filmed. It is the best thriller/mystery that I have seen in a longtime.  At two and a half hours, the film has no boring spots; your attention remains rapt until the surprising conclusion.</p></body></html>

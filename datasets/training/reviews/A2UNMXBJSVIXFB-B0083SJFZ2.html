<meta name="summary" content="Clash of the Titans (2010) (Blu-ray)"></head><body><p>Movie - 4.0<br /><br />While Clash '81 may be Ray Harryhausen's final legacy to a brilliant career and the center of reminiscence for many a child growing up or being born in that decade, I'm going to be honest and say I thought Clash '81 was a good, but not great movie. The reason being because I recently saw Jason and the Argonauts, a film that clearly surpasses Clash '81 in almost every conceivable category be it storytelling, special effects, overall production, and even BD presentation. 18 years after the fact and Clash '81 barely feels like an upgrade over Jason in terms of.. well, anything. The stop animation is barely on par, while the pacing and narrative are even a tad weaker, and yet it's still treasured just for the sake of nostalgia. When I heard a new version of Clash was being directed by Louis Letterier, I was pretty excited. Being familiar with his previous works I knew he came from an action background as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; under Luc Besson and that he'd easily find ways to improve the shortcomings of the original to make a more fulfilling fantasy epic. Aside from character and location names, that's about all both movies have in common. And in creating his version from scratch, I feel Letterier has managed to make a very good and entertaining action flick that's not so much a remake, but rather an adaptation for today's audiences. It's a darker, grittier, and more violent film with all sorts of new characters, themes, and special effects that make for better and faster-paced storytelling. Instead of the playful nature of the original where the gods were just bickering over superiority and toying around with their chessboard, or the way Perseus just slowly made his way from point to point with little to no difficulty, I actually felt a deeper sense of drive and purpose from this new version. For starters, the gods actually show emotion: desperation for the love/fear of the people and the power it gives them, jealousy, spite, and vengeance through deception (between Zeus and Hades), and even a little bit of humility (in what Zeus learns about man from Perseus). Meanwhile, the new Perseus actually has some character depth as well: his demi-god blood puts him at odds with the people he's trying to help, while his pride in being raised as a man makes him stubborn in accepting his god-given gifts and heritage, yet he still chooses to fight the oppressive rule of the gods and show them the virtues of being a man. These themes obviously don't get as much exposure as they should, what with a mere 95 minutes of screen time. But having set this foundation of ideals, hopefully the sequels will expand upon them. Much like Letterier's The Incredible Hulk, watch it for the action, but expect hints of story and character.<br /><br />Video - 4.5<br /><br />While the photography of Clash '10 does, indeed, have a kind of a processed look, it's actually not that bad. I would personally attribute it to something along the lines of visual effects and/or tweaks made during post-production that, at times, gives certain scenes either a kind of shiny or hazy look (like Mount Olympus and the gods' Saint Seiya armor or the ferry trip across the River Styx). But despite the near-grainless appearance, picture quality looks excellent. Colors from the costuming, set design, beautifully-shot backgrounds, and various creatures still possess a degree of vibrancy from the palace props and soldiers' gear, to the lush greens of the forest and fiery reds of Medusa's lair, to the murky brown scales and tentacles of the Kraken. Black levels are nice and inky, though not too deep, but with great shadow delineation, as seen in the black Pegasus or Stygian Mountain when the witches are introduced. Contrast provides for accurate brightness when need be, though the film itself tries to be a little too dark at times and, thus, loses some detail in people and objects leading to bits and pieces of softness. On the bright side, there don't appear to be any signs of Edge Enhancement or DNR, and the picture is completely free of artifacts and debris. CG integration is especially smooth, with highlights being the various appearances of Hades and, of course, the aforementioned Kraken. It should also be noted that 90% of the backgrounds are not even green screen, which amazes me that places like that even exist, so be sure to take those images in as you see them.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Besides the cinematography and special effects, one of my favorite improvements with this new Clash is its sound. Granted the original, like many a Harryhausen feature, was a bit on the low-budget side of production, but it's nice to see and hear the differences in advancement. Dialogue is clear and undistorted through the center and does a great job staying audible amongst the action, while the growls of Zeus and the haunting whispers of Hades give the script a much-appreciated Thespian quality. Directionality has an excellent sense of depth with sounds and action filling their respective speakers when needed, most notably in the battle against Medusa as she rattles and slithers about her temple. Separation is also spot-on with effects and music dispersing equally through the fronts and rears to accompany the situation. While it's a shame Craig Armstrong was dropped as composer (love his work for The Incredible Hulk), Ramin Djawadi's stuff isn't so bad. I actually like his score for Iron Man, and it was nice to hear him try something with more orchestral instrumentation. If you like brass, expect to hear a lot of it. And finally, LFEs aren't as frequent as I expected, but they really pack a punch when they occur. The thundering of Zeus's bolts in the sky, the Scorpinochs battle, and the rising of the Kraken will give your subwoofer a thoroughly progressive workout as each scene unfolds and builds upon the narrative. The overall track may or may not be reference to some, probably depending on your standards for LFEs, but given that there really aren't a whole lot of instances for LFEs to shine in the first place, this might be enough for others.<br /><br />Extras - 4.0<br /><br />This is my second time ever for a Maximum Movie Mode (the first being Sherlock Holmes). And while it's a tad disappointing Letterier couldn't do the entire thing in person, I actually still liked the commentary, regardless. Instead of the 2-screen, 1-director approach, we get a 2-3-screen presentation where the movie plays bigger and the commentary/interviews play in a smaller screen and takes turns switching priority. In-between these segments, icons for Focus Features will pop up and allow the user to watch a branched-off making-of sequence that lasts about 2-4 minutes per Feature for about 35 minutes total. These Focus Features do not constitute the entire MMM, by the way, and can be viewed separately from the MMM itself if you want. In addition to the Focus Features, the MMM actually takes up a good majority of the film providing lots of cool factoids and opinions from the cast and crew about the filming, design, production, writing, stunt work, and just about everything else. Objectively, all the information probably would've made a fine behind-the-scenes featurette on its own. But to watch it in real-time during the movie is what I think really raises my appreciation the most. The MMM literally explains and expands on every little bit of the movie piece by piece, and I applaud everyone involved for their hard work and perseverance. To top it all off, there's also an 8-minute feature on Sam Worthington that talks about the fact that he did most of his own stunts (a little generic, but I applaud his toughness), deleted scenes that would've completely changed the context of the story, and an alternate ending that wasn't as good as I'd hoped. It's not a lot of extras in terms of quantity, but the quality of it for the MMM alone is worth a look.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />Nostalgia will probably be the deal-breaker for most people wanting to see this movie. If you prefer the original version for its light-heartedness and more campy demeanor, chances are you won't like this new version because of its inclination toward a darker, grittier atmosphere. If you're like me and one of the few fans of Letterier that can appreciate his forte for action while also realizing this is just the beginning of a trilogy, then maybe you'll like this version enough and forgive a lot of its newer elements in writing and character portrayal. With excellent video, reference audio, and a commentary feature that continues to amaze me, Clash of the Titans (2010) comes highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="New cut of the film is pretty good, but bonus features are fantastic"></head><body><p>The pleasant yet undeniably featherweight souffle that was 2005's "Fantastic Four" is now, in this extended cut, a pleasant featherweight souffle with perhaps a tad more richness in the batter.  Fans will likely enjoy the extra bit of heft in the proceedings, but will also probably notice that the extra scenes aren't particularly indispensible or brilliant or make the movie a whole lot better.  They're just interesting and fun to see.<br /><br />Technically, this new cut looks and plays fine.  If seamless branching is employed to add the extra scenes when the extended cut option is selected (both the theatrical cut and the extended cut are offered here), the result is indeed seamless.  I experienced no pauses or other "bumps" when watching the extended cut; it played like a regular movie.  And I hardly have state-of-the-art equipment.<br /><br />But while the new extended cut of the film offers good entertainment value, disc two is the real keeper here.  If the producers annoyed many FF fans by changing a lot of the team's established mythology for the film, it looks like they're trying to win back their love by including extremely generous features about the comic book and its creative forces on the bonus disc.  The extra features are a treasure trove of behind-the-scenes lore about the FF comic book, and alone justify the price of the DVD.</p></body></html>

For example, after making the dark, dramatic "Fargo", they made this film - "The Big Lebowski", a comedy about a stoner who gets his rug stolen.  What other filmmakers would make such a leap from film to film, and continuing doing so through all of their films?  Only the Coen brothers.<br /><br />"The Big Lebowski" stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey Lebowski, an unemployed man known to everyone as "The Dude".  His life revolves around the nights spent bowling with his buddies Donny (Steve Buscemi) and Walter (John Goodman), the latter of which is an easily upset Vietnam vet.  Life is good for The Dude - until two thugs beat him up and pee on his rug, mistaking him for a different Jeffrey Lebowski.  The Dude goes to visit "the Big Lebowski" (David Huddleston) and tells him about it.  Shortly thereafter, The Dude is beat up by three people he's never met, then ordered by the Big Lebowski to be the courier in an exchange - the Big Lebowski's wife, Bunny (a young Tara Reid) has just been kidnapped.  From there on, things get worse and worse for The Dude.  How he's gonna get himself out of it is anyone's guess.<br /><br />"The Big Lebowski" is really a fantastic film.  There is a well-written, clever, and funny script - which isn't really a surprise from the Coen brothers.  Great directing and cinematography (the latter by Roger Deakins), particularly during some wonderfully quirky dream sequences.  There's also a really cool soundtrack, featuring Bob Dylan, CCR, and more.<br /><br />But what would the film be without the cast?  Jeff Bridges is really great and funny as The Dude.  The real highlight of the cast is probably John Goodman, who is absolutely hilarious as The Dude's over-the-top best friend.  There's also good performances from Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Huddleston, and Sam Elliott.  Coen brothers favorites Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, and Peter Stormmare also appear.<br /><br />As I've said, the thing that is most appealing about the Coen brothers are the differences between each of their films.  "The Big Lebowski" is one of their very best.  It's a stoner movie - and it's one of the best movies ever made.  Watch it, dude.  You won't regret it.</p></body></html>

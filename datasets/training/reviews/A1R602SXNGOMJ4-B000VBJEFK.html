<meta name="summary" content="Extremely Disappointing"></head><body><p>After reading the glowing reviews, I had nothing but the highest expectations from Ratatouille.  Ratatouille is terrible. I can describe it no other way.  What was the point of this film? I suppose something democratic like "anyone can cook," but honestly, was that really the point?  The story was boring. Really boring...and predictable and way too long.  Ratatouille had two stories that went nowhere.<br />Everyone knows the premise by now: a rat works undercover as a chef in a fancy restaurant to prove that "anyone" can be a great chef if they want to. We know this theme because it is repeated ad nauseum to stretch out a movie that has nothing else to offer. That is not the only idea that is repeated over and over again. Cooking scenes, the rat being hunted and chased by the head chef, the love/hate dynamics between the two "human" leads, all make you wonder when we'll see anything new before the movie ends. We don't; the story just limps to its foregone conclusion.<br />Not the worst film I have every seen but in no way what so ever a classic of any type.</p></body></html>

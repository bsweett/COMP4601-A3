<meta name="summary" content="Utterly Perplexing Remake....Why?"></head><body><p>Firstly, I wish you all the merriest Beltane! Some cinephiles may celebrate May Day with a viewing of the wonderful cult classic film The Wicker Man, although it certainly works as a critique toward all faith.  I mean of course the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005KHJM">original 1973 film</a> and not its 2006 remake which I finally sat through recently and hated with great passion.  Neil LaBute directs and writes the screenplay, which is a bit surprising because his films haven't been significantly unimpressive; at least until now that is.  The cast includes the likes of Ellen Burstyn, Frances Conroy, Leelee Sobieski, Molly Parker and of course Nicholas Cage as the film's protagonist. All should've promptly fired their management. The music for this film is by veteran Angelo Badalamenti.  With that kind of talent you may on the surface wonder what could've gone wrong, but I can assure you that the flaws are many and they are actually quite easy to pinpoint.<br /><br />The Wicker Man is, in short, about a man who investigates a mysterious island after hearing about his ex-girlfriend's missing daughter.  The plot is roughly the same as the plot of the original, at least on the surface.  All of the changes, and I mean every last one of them, were made with no concern whatsoever to the elements that made the original film so compelling and unique.  Cage's character is not a virgin, nor is he notably religious in any way, which immediately eliminates the significance of the message from the original film.  If anything, Cage's character comes off as a bit misogynistic and the film's villain played by Burstyn comes off as a feminist.  Are we to believe that Cage deserved his fate for his misogyny or that the feminists are evil? Or both?  The festival of the original was of course for May Day, here it is for a completely made up holiday while the film takes place on an island off of an American coast as opposed to an island off of the coast of Scotland like the original film.  This was even PG-13 when one of the key elements to the original were the unconventional sexual overtones in the face of a devout Christian.  But let's not forget, no bewbs can be seen in American theaters by anyone under the age of 17, at least without an adult present to explain exactly what those are!  Amazing, especially with so many other gratuitous elements presented within this garbage.<br /><br />All in all, The Wicker Man remake was nominated for five Golden Raspberry awards and cost $35 million to make.  It made $32 million worldwide and has been as widely panned by critics as infamous stinkers like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AM6NV">Boat Trip</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006CXI1">Death to Smoochy</a>.  Thank goodness for that as we may have had an even worse sequel to worry about.  Even an actor like Nicholas Cage, who has a history of poor judgement in taking roles, should've known better than this.  It was evidently a huge waste of money to make and it will be a waste of money for you to buy.  I highly recommend the original for only two dollars more, but avoid this one at all costs unless you're searching for unintended laughter.  Cage prancing around and yelling in a bear suit is really funny, but the plot-holes alone will keep you smiling.</p></body></html>

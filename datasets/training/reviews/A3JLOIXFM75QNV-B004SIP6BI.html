Alright, so he doesn't necessarily make the movie, Juliette Binoche is fantastic too, as well as the rest of the supporting cast. They all do a great job of portraying what life was probably like in a small French village, in that time period. It seems like every character is hiding some little secret. Its a great mix of mystery and romance and even a little bit of fantasy. This refreshing movie should be seen by all chocolate lovers, and even non-lovers!</p></body></html>

I suppose they aren't happy with a movie unless there is a car chase, and a few explosions, and a thousand bullets.<br />Forget the naysayers, forget the people who couldn't keep more than one plot line in their heads at a time. They're happier watching reruns of South Park.<br />If you want to see cinema as a work of art, this is your movie. It is not to be taken literally. It is a work of allegory. For instance, quiz shows are not live, and they don't have shows pitting children against adults, with the children besting the adults. There obviously wouldn't be a 'Seduce and Destroy' infomercial. It is all over the top to make a point. And that point is....relationships, love, and loss. What a powerful film. Yep, it's long, but well worth it. This is a must-have DVD.</p></body></html>

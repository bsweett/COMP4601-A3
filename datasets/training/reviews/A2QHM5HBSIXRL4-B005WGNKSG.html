<meta name="summary" content="Director Niels Arden Oplev strips Larsson's story down to its core: the hunt for Harriet Vanger"></head><body><p>I'm a fervent and early fan of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy.  I would have flown to another city to watch this film if I had to.  Luckily, I live in one of the country's best cities for art house cinema:  Dallas.  Yes, contrary to the expected stereotypes I always have to bat down when I tell out-of-town friends this fact: Dallas has a tremendous art house cinema culture.  And, as testament to that, we got "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" very early.  What a thrill for us.<br /><br />I am not going to claim that the movie is better than the book.  What makes the books so compelling are the monster-deep dives Larsson takes into varied areas like investigative journalism, corruption, hacking, mafia, governmental affairs, mafia-government connections, intelligence agencies, detectives..and a host of others.  What makes the first book spin is its dual axes of investigative journalism and hacking, personified respectively by Larsson's two protagonists, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander.  In the movie, something's gotta give: there's just no earthly way director Niels Arden Oplev is going to be able to fit all of Larsson's work into a film of slightly less than three hours.<br /><br />So what Oplev does is strip the story down to its core: the hunt for Harriet Vanger.  It's this case that serendipitously brings Blomkvist and Salander together.  In the process of the focus, we lose some of the flavor that is the hallmark of the book, most notably much of the investigative journalism as practiced inside the walls of Millennium magazine.  Millennium's editor, Erika Berger, is but a footnote in the movie but a big part of the book.  Likewise, little attention is given to the so-called "Wennerstr&ouml;m Affair," the personal and professional downfall that befalls Mikael at the book's outset.  Indeed, the first third of the book focuses mainly on these two elements of the tale.<br /><br />Similarly, we lose out on some other aspects of Mikael's character.  Mainly, his babe-magnetism.  In the movie, he and Salander develop a sexual relationship.  [Indeed, it's undertones of the memories of this relationship that drives much of books two and three.]  But the movie has removed the sexual aspects from two of the other relationships Mikael has with female characters.<br /><br />Despite all that, this movie lives and dies on one turn: it's ability to 'get it right' with its casting of Lisbeth.  Over and over I would to my wife "Lisbeth better be good."  And she'd tell me the same thing repeatedly.  And others I know have the same mantra: don't mess with my ideal vision of Lisbeth.  In that light, Noomi Rapace represents deliverance.  She scored the essence of the character: we want Lisbeth to have that mix of smarts, hardened exterior, quirky beauty, ferocity and manic energy that drives the book.  Ms. Rapace delivers all that in spades.  She's maybe a little less elfin than the character described by Larsson, but other than that, she's the Lisbeth from my head.<br /><br />I urge all fans of the book to see this enjoyable adaptation.  [The producers had the smarts to make all three movies at once, so the other two are headed this way.]  This is a Swedish story through and through.  It deserves to be seen in Swedish.</p></body></html>

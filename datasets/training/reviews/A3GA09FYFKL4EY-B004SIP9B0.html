Still, the subject matter still has some feel of tabloid sensationalism, with its dramatization of political scrambling in the aftermath of the shocking death of Diana, Princess of Wales.<br /><br />No one the movie seems to care about the tragedy itself - only how to secure their personal positions in the eyes of the public. There was no real grief for Diana, and that is indescribably sad.<br /><br />The best thing about "The Queen" goes back to what Ms. Mirren said in her Oscar acceptance speech: that Elizabeth Windsor has weathered so many storms in her 50-plus years on the throne. The movie certainly does justice to Her Majesty's indomitable strength, and the legacy that she is leaving for history.</p></body></html>

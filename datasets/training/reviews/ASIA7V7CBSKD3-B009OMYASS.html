At best the special effects are okay (other times they look like something straight out of a Troma movie).  If you are looking for a movie with excessive nudity and bloody violence then "Hostel" is for you.  This movie will leave you feeling distrubed as some of the scenes are extremely intense.  More freaky then scary this movie is not for the faint of heart.  Jay Hernandez is excellent as he and his buddies go in search of the Sex Mecca of Europe (the rest of the no-name actors do a pretty good job - the girls are super good-looking).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Thumbs up for two extremely absorbing performances."></head><body><p>I must say, my preconceptions about Training Day were all wrong.  The trailer I saw in the theatres made it look like a belated ripoff of The Corruptor, while director Antoine Fuqua's disastrous fumble with The Replacement Killers several years ago did nothing to boost my confidence.<p>My doubts were dispelled the minute Denzel Washington looked up from his newspaper.  It is indeed good to see Washington, one of the most gifted actors of our time, abandon the saintly martyrs he's been prone to playing for 10 years and sink his teeth into a role which allows him to show a mix of deep charisma and dangerous viciousness.  That same alchemy had made his breakthrough performance in 1989's Glory  amazingly compelling, and in Training Day, there isn't a single moment where Washington is less than completely absorbing.  Ethan Hawke also gives the performance of his career as Jake Hoyt, an idealistic but easily swayed young cop who finds himself drawn into a web of corruption, violence, and twisted morals.<p>Fuqua's directing is still overly stylish at times, but after a hyperactive first act, the film begins to roar.  David Ayer's script is dazzling, a combination of rat-a-tat street vernacular and relentless forward momentum, and after the midpoint of the movie, the intensity of the scenes would reach incredible levels.  And that's when Fuqua's show-offy camerawork finds a raison d'etre.  In this film, Fuqua even finds room for some comparatively simple scenes which are really like a breath of fresh air to his filmmaking -- for example, the &quot;you're a leader&quot; car scene, and that beautifully understated ending shot.  I hope he makes this part of his regular style, because there's only so much virtuoso camera one can take before it gets tiring, as is the case in the opening of the film.<p>A white-knuckle thriller, well worthy of the accolades it received.  I stand humbly corrected on my original predictions.</p></body></html>

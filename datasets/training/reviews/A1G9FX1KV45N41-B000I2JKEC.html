<meta name="summary" content="Brought to you from Kryptonite"></head><body><p>A great movie from 1978 , about the Marvel comics superhero. Faced with the destruction of their planet Kryptonite, Jor-El (Marlon Brando) and his wife Lara  (Susannah York) send their infant son to the planet earth, where he is found by a childless elderly couple in Kansas. Growing up as a curiosity, by the name of Clark Kent, with superhuman strength, he becomes a reporter, who at times metamorphosis's into Superman. But nobody knows that Clark Kent is Superman. Though not even Superman's sweetheart, Lois Lane (a fresh faced Margo Kidder) knows that Kent is Superman.<br /><br />Anyway it is up to Superman in this adventure to foil the evil plans of the mastermind criminal Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) to destroy California. Generally thrillingly done, with a lighthearted feel through most of it, and it is noteworthy that they play a part of the 1977 hit by Supertramp, `Give a Little Bit'. It was a bit silly though when Superman flew around the Earth several times to reverse time. Couldn't he have just rescued Lois Lane to begin with. Other than that well worth seeing again.</p></body></html>

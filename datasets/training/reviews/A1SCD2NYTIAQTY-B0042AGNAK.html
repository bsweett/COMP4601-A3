<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining Comic Hero"></head><body><p>Having never read the comics, not being a fan of comics in general, I didn't really know what to expect from "Ghostrider". The only thing I knew was that he looked pretty cool and I liked his chopper.<br /><br />Johnny Blaze, (Cage), sells his soul to the devil in return for his father's health. Satan being Satan interprets the deal extremely literally and does what he does best: shafts Blaze, (both of them). Johnny becomes a famous stunt rider and has to answer the call to become the Devil's Ghostrider, a sort of contract-bound bounty hunter.<br /><br />The premise is very good and the whole anti-hero thing works well, although unlike the "Spiderman" movies, the whole characterisation was not explored so deeply in this movie. The story itself is relatively predictable, which also detracts a little from the movie itself. It can be hoped that these will develop in later installments, (if they are forthcoming), as they did with "Spiderman". This would make Ghostrider a very cool superhero.<br /><br />The special effects are excellent, as one would expect from such a movie, and they alone make the movie worth seeing. The special features of this package of the DVD are also in depth and relatively interesting. I particularly liked the history documentary about the comic books, which was a nice filler for one who has never heard of them before.<br /><br />Overall, this is pretty good package and one that I would recommend with some reservations. The movie did not "wow" me, and lacked some of that "X" factor that makes movies really cool. There was something missing from it, perhaps lack of character exploration and excessive predictability. However, I did enjoy it and it is possible it will grow on me later.</p></body></html>

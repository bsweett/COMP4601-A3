<meta name="summary" content="Well Done Action Movie"></head><body><p>UNSTOPPABLE is a genre film - minimal story/lots of action - and as such it succeeds very well.  Probably for audience breathing time the story line introduces some psychological exchanges between the two characters - in formation about their family lives that seem oddly out of place with all the terror on the screen - and that aspect of the film adds some human drama that makes the final product more credible: it is, actually based on a true story. The fact that veteran action flick creators - writer Mark Bombeck and director Tony Scott - are 'on board' this project assures the popularity quotient.<br /><br />Frank (Denzel Washington) is an aging soon to be retired train engineer and is joined by a young, emotionally distracted but well-trained new conductor Will (Chris Pine) who are out on what seems to be a routine run in Pennsylvania.  They banter caustically until hearing that there is a full speed runaway train (engineer Dewey - Ethan Suplee - left his position in the train with the throttle on) that happens to be carrying toxic chemicals. Should the train proceed with its runaway course many lives could be endangered when the train reaches a critical curve in the tracts in Stanton , PA.  Frank decides the only way to stop the train would be to go in reverse and lock onto the back of the train, putting on the brakes to slow the runaway train.  Frank and Will decide to brave the elements and attempt this near impossible task, much against the advice of the chief Galvin (Kevin Dunn) but with the daring go ahead signal form the men's immediate boss Connie (Rosario Dawson).  During this breakneck chase Will relates his fragile marriage to a wife (Jessy Schram) who refuses to return or accept his calls and Frank confides in Will that his wife died a few years ago form cancer, leaving his the sole parent for his two daughters (Elizabeth Mathis and Meagan Tandy): they both have family deadlines to meet that very day.  How the two not only become friends but allies in heroic effort to stop the incipient tragedy makes of the ending of the film.<br /><br />Washington and Pine make fine acting partners and the off the tracks work by Dawson and Dunn and the other small parts are well executed.  The special effects are excellent.  The fact that seemingly far-fetched story is true adds to the appreciation of the film.  This is a solid action flick with some standout performances.

<meta name="summary" content="THEY DON'T GET MUCH WILDER"></head><body><p>Thirty years later, Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder's YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN remains a classic comedy, filmed with such loving affection for the classic it spoofed.  So much of the humor is played so straight, it becomes even funnier.  All the actors have their own crowning moments, many of which have been reiterated by other reviewers.  But take the film's classic black and white photography and cinematography which evokes the pure essence of the original films.  Gene Wilder is perfect as the heir to the Frankenstein legacy, and his comic timing has never been better.  Marty Feldman is pure magic in his role as Eyegor, the bug-eyed assistant who is lecherous, witty and morose all at the same time.  Teri Garr is brilliant as Inga, the buxom assistant whose German accent is so good it's amazing.  Peter Boyle, barely recognizable under the expert make-up, does wonders with his eyes and his duet with Wilder on "Puttin on the Ritz" is superb.  Cloris Leachman is great, but I wish she had more screen time; her Frau Brucher (Neighhh) is a comic masterpiece.  And of course the late Madeline Kahn also brutally underused, is magnificent as Elizabeth, whose roll in the hay with the Monster is tremendous.  Gene Hackman in his cameo as the blind man is top notch; only an irritating Kenneth Mars "mars" the perfect casting.<br /><br />But one cannot help but admit YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is one of the funniest films Brooks ever made and one of the best American comedies of our time.</p></body></html>

Is this the worst Indy film?  Yeah, probably.  However, it still fits okay into the franchise.  Four Stars For Nostalgias Sake.  This series really should have taken the "James Bond Route" and began casting new leads to lend viability to the franchise.  At this point it's too late.  Still, it was fun while it lasted and took me back to the truly great films of the 80s.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Two Minute Warning"></head><body><p>The Two Minute Warning might have been a better title for this film, as Next is the name of last years Michael Crichton novel, and "The Golden Man" the name of the story that the film was based on would be confusing. Philip K. Dick the late great Short Story writer, has been adapted many times in the last few years, trying to recapture the brilliance of "Blade Runner" (the adaptation of "do androids dream of electric sheep) which was in fact better than the story.<br /><br />Next almost (but not quite) triumphs, the writing is pretty good, but unfortunately the actors are never quite able to make it completely convincing or believable. After watching the DVD, I watched the interviews with the cast and saw that all they cast had to say was how great it was to work with Nick Cage. Cage, who really did the best job in the film, but listening to him talk... He clearly didn't understand the concepts involved in the film, and with all the other actors taking the lead from him, the shortcomings were understandable.<br /><br />Still, this is a pretty good DVD, (with some original concepts, picking up on the girl, and the fighting were especially interestingly done) when compared to what is out there, so if you like movies with an element of ESP, you should enjoy this just fine. I'd just advise you to skip the commentary</p></body></html>

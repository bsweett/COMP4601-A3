<meta name="summary" content="The story is King"></head><body><p>Any Clint Eastwood film is going to be masterfully crafted.So, the content is what one may like or dislike, but rarely is the film a bad product. And this film has a great story, and a superb craftsmanship. With, to my surprise, the main music being done by Clint, and in the extras, you can see some of the theme music being played by clint.<br />  Given its unique material, the first film I thought was similar to it was AFTERLIFE; with the caveat that AFTERLIFE is a first film, and so is not as refined as the material, and the execution of this film. HEREAFTER delivers a quality supernatural undertone without this wonderfully chilling element subsuming the character driven content of Clint's film. The way the story weaves together three people's lives and eventually brings the two leads together, is both brilliant on the film level, and emotionally fulfilling on the personal level. The dramatic tones are a superb experience on the heavier side ( the supernatural elements) as well as the themes of loss relating to the young British actor, and the French actress who visits a character who is remarkably like Dr Elizabeth Kubler-Ross ( in some respects, not all). For AFTERLIFE, and HEREAFTER, my comment for the AFTERLIFE review was that the coment "get a life" applies; well, Afterlife achieves this in a heavy handed way, and HEREAFTER achieves this in a dramatically fulfilling way, with a style few people can manage. Also, the extras on the DVD are great, they shows elements that I would suggest you don't watch until after seeing the film, since the they show how the strong and very realistic images are achieved.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has done another great piece, very strong on many levels, and whilst it achieves the surreal elements I prefer, it also gives the heart ache of the personal experience in its sadest times.</p></body></html>

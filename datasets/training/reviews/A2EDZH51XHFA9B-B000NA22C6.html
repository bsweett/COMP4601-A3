Now, The Dark Half was taken on by a mighty, mighty director, George Romero, and it failed miserably. David Koepp is a good director (witness Stir of Echoes) and, when he wants to be, a fantastic writer (Bad Influence, the underrated TV series Hack), but let's face it, David Koepp is not on the level of George Romero. So why did anyone think this was going to work?<br /><br />Granted, they assembled one of the finest casts in recent history here-- Johnny Depp, Golden Globe winner and nominated for more Golden Globes, Oscars, and Oranges than you can shake a stick at; Golden Globe nominee and Cannes Best Actor winner John Turturro; Golden Globe nominee Maria Bello; Oscar and Golden Globe winner Timothy Hutton; Emmy winner and Golden Globe nominee Charles S. Dutton... I could keep going, but why? You've got a who's-who of underrated Hollywood already. And every one of them turns in a performance as wooden as the trees in Maine. Even Johnny Depp, who in a thirty-film career has never, even in his worst films, played a role that wasn't excellent, is off form here for the first (and perhaps only) time in his career. Depp, who has made a number of otherwise awful films worth watching, however marginally (Sleepy Hollow, The Astronaut's Wife, Don Juan DeMarco), can't save this turkey. The pacing is horrendous, and boredom will set in before ten minutes have passed. I will warn you, it gets no better. This is a thriller completely devoid of thrills, a mystery that's solvable long before the boneheads on the screen work it out. Normally, watching Johnny Depp act would be enough reason to rent this, but it doesn't cut the mustard this time. *</p></body></html>

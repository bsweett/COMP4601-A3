It features Shadowy Ex-Military Types, Corrupt Senators and Nefarious Plots. Good thing there is a Lone Patriot.<br /><br />* How do we know "Shooter" is Very Serious? A title card doesn't read "3 years later." Oh no. It reads "36 months later."<br /><br />* Danny Glover is one of Shadowy Types. Is there something wrong with him? He walks so uneasily he practically waddles and talks with a lisp so noticeable you can see a wall of spit frothing under his lower lip. My prayers for him, but goodness.<br /><br />* Mark Wahlberg is the Lone Patriot, Bob Lee Swagger, who's hired by the Shadowy Types to plan an execution of the President, so they can stop an Inside Job in Philadelphia. Except the Shadowy Types are the Inside Job, and the Lone Patriot is their Fall Guy.<br /><br />* Good thing Micheal Pena plays FBI agent Nick Memphis as the Lone Patriot's Only Defender.<br /><br />* To recap: Bob Lee Swagger and Nick Memphis. Those are their names. Eventually Swagger will wear a feathered snowsuit and Memphis will go sleeveless.<br /><br />* Now each of them get a Supportive, Completely Platonic Girl Friend. Swagger gets his Dead Partner's Widow (Kate Mara). Memphis gets a sympathetic FBI agent (Rhona Mitra).<br /><br />* But only the Widow gets to carve a couple bullets out of Swagger after he knocks himself out with the gas from a can of whipped cream. And only the Widow wears a blonde wig and leather miniskirt as a disguise. And only the Widow has lines like "Don't you take that away from him!" and "You best call me Sarah."<br /><br />* Alas, the Widow also has to get kidnapped by a particularly Shadowy Type who likes to lick her face and whisper "There's your boy!"<br /><br />* Let's do a quick review of a homemade weaponry featured in "Shooter": An IV made out of a turkey baster. A silencer made out of a water bottle and a sponge. A machine out of "Saw" that forces a guy to shoot himself in the head. A rifle that shoots by remote. Pipe bombs. Napalm. Yes, homemade napalm. And a truck that travels from Virginia to Montana in a matter of 12 hours.<br /><br />* Ned Beatty is the Corrupt Senator. Beatty, mourning the fact that he played a great role just like this 30 years ago in "Network," belches absurd lines here like "There are haves, and have nots!"<br /><br />* There's an Apocalyptic Old Man in "Shooter," too. You know the guy. He was here before time yet was and will remain until the Rapture to expense bizarre wisdom in his house in the woods. In "Shooter," Old Man knows guns inside and out, and where all the world's best snipers are hidden.<br /><br />* Because the movie never explains it, you should know that Ethiopia and Eritrea are two different countries. Do you notice how action movies use geography like "ER" uses medical terminology? Like this: BotchedopsecafterroutingEritreannationals.<br /><br />* The movie ends three times, kills about 100 people, blows a bishop's head off, and ends on this classic image: A vintage Camaro, driving down the middle of a two-lane highway. Yep - straddling the center line.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest, if Timothy McVeigh penned a script in hell, sent it through the devil's Floo Network to John Allen Muhammad, who pitched it to Hollywood brass during visiting hours, it'd look and sound a lot like "Shooter." It gives turkeys a bad name.</p></body></html>

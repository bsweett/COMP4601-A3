<meta name="summary" content="Good movie"></head><body><p>Ive had this dvd sitting around for the past few years and I finally got around to watch it. I loved this movie. The colors are rich, the effects are top notch, and it has some pretty good action sequences. Guillermo del Toro is an excellent director. The dvd has four cartoons as extras and the Tell Tale Heart is pretty amazing. I thought the second disc was unneccesary. Still, a great buy if you like action movies.</p></body></html>

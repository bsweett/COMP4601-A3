<meta name="summary" content="Best movie I've seen so far this year."></head><body><p>Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is the Vice President of an organization created by the cigarette conglomerate, a position that carries with it responsibility of being the chief spokesperson for Big Tobacco. He does not have the advanced degrees that other successful businessmen have, but he has a self-proclaimed bachelor's in "kicking ass and taking names." Nick is a talker and he is very good at what he does. And he must juggle his job (spinning on behalf of cigarette companies) and being a positive role model for his son.<br /><br />As if a man in such a position is not accustomed to conflict, he encounters further trouble from an outspoken Senator (William H. Macy) and a feisty newspaper reporter (Katie Holmes).<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart was great. He really did a fabulous job. The sly, "I've got a secret" smirk he wore for so much of the movie was fantastic. You have probably seen a movie he has been in, if you are wondering who he is. He has played some small, though decent roles. The movie for which I am most familiar with Aaron is In The Company of Men. To see him transition from that small production nearly ten years ago to playing a part for which he should receive an award or two is great. He was very engaging in this role. He will keep your captivated. Aaron Eckhart sells this role like Nick Naylor sells Big Tobacco.<br /><br />The slow development of Joey Naylor, Nick's son was done very well. From the early part of the film when he pleads with his dad to not ruin his childhood to when he finally takes his dad's advice about how to present an argument through to the end, Joey was a great side story.<br /><br />Maria Bello and David Koechner round out Nick Naylor's MOD Squad in expert fashion. Their constant sparring around the lunch table is definitely one of the highlights of the movie.<br /><br />The writing was fast and funny. The movie is full of one liners, but they come at you from all directions so be sure to keep up.<br /><br />Rob Lowe's cameo was perfect. The setup of walking through his office building, his assistant Jack, the late night phone call, it was all hilarious.<br /><br />Thank You For Smoking kept me entertained and kept me laughing. I really enjoyed the movie.</p></body></html>

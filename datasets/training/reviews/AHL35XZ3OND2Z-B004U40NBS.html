Yeesh.<br /><br />This is the female version of The Wrestler, another Darren Aronofsky story arc of love, hate and masochistic self destruction.<br /><br />Yawn.<br /><br />Just as they hand out 3D glasses to watch Avatar, Zoloft should be mandatory for every Aronofsky screening. It's a downer, but knowing that from the get-go, there's little to interest besides the sex scene. The acting is good, but Mila Kunis is the real gem here. I said it after Closer and I still believe it today - Natalie Portman is not much of an actress. She peaked with The Professional. She has a cute face, but carries no dramatic weight. Isn't that what we have Sandra Bullock for?<br /><br />Here would be a twist for Aronofsky, recast the Natalie Portman role with Mickey Rourke. Now we got something interesting going.<br /><br />"First rule of Ballerina Club IS, you do not talk about Ballerina Club!"</p></body></html>

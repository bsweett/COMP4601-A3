<meta name="summary" content="A good horror film with an interesting premise, but flawed nonetheless"></head><body><p>Actor-writer Leigh Whannel stars with Cary Elwes and Danny Glover in this horror-thriller in the vein of Seven. Newcomer James Wan takes on the directing duties for this ambitious, but flawed film called Saw. Financed by Lions Gate Films which is quickly earning the reputation for taking chances on small, low-budget horror films that other major studios and their independent house won't touch.<br /><br />Saw succeeds in creating a palpable dread and tension as the character of Adam (Whannel) and Lawrence (Elwes in scenery-chewing mode) wake up with no memory of how they got into chained-up in adingy and dimly lit shower room. Slowly the two characters try to figure out why they've been chained into pipings in the room. Soon ehough a tape recorded message informs them of the situation they're in and all of it due to demented criminal who the press and the police have dubbed Jigsaw. The premise of their incarceration is simple. Jigsaw wants them to play a game where they must find clues and tools hidden around the room and escape from just in time to save Lawrence's wife and daughter. This premise and the reasoning as to why they must play this game is one of this film's strong points, but it also becomes one of its flaws as the Whannel overwrites the dialogue into trying to explain everything through the Elwes character. Whannel as a writer doesn't seem to trust his audience to solve or even understand the premise and Jigsaw. Unlike Seven which gives just enough hints and clues for people to try and solve the problem, Saw pretty much tries to give everything away. Fortunately, the story in convoluted and twisty enough that the audience might be confused by the time Elwes character over-explains everything. Saw is the kind of film that surely would've benefitted from the concept of less is more.<br /><br />The acting is average to say the least with Elwes chewing up every scene he's in. It's hard to gauge whether Elwes' performance was due to the pedestrian script he had to read from or if he thought that was what the character needed. Either way his character dominated the film even in scenes when he should've stayed in the background. Whannel as an actor is believable enough and probably a level better than as a writer. Though he was abit too subdued, but then that might've been due to the fact he had to act opposite of the over-the-top Elwes. Danny Glover makes an appearance as a burned-out cop whose earlier run-in with Jigsaw led to his partner's death and him scarred for life. Glover's seems to barely register in the film and his character seems abit tacked on to give the story an added dimension to make it complex. Horror films should really try to stay simple.<br /><br />Saw does deliver in the gore department, but not overly much. It just had enough squirm-inducing scenes in the beginning, middle and end chapters to make the film worthwhile to fans of R-rated horror. This film will not be mistaken for one of the PG-13 Japanese ghost remakes of the last five years. As stated earlier this film owes alot more to Fincher's Seven than to Nakata's Ringu series. The quick frantic beginning makes way for a middle part where too much talking and not enough horror sequences. Fortunately, the pacing speeds up once more in the last 10-15 minutes as Jigsaw's game and manipulations come to a bloody and twisted end.<br /><br />One thing to mention as a stand-out character even though he's only on the screen a limited time is the genre actor Tobin Bell who plays Jigsaw with a twisted sense of tragic nobility. As much as Jigsaw may be the demented creator of the game and trap Adam and Lawrence have been put in, it was very difficult not to admire Bell's character. He's not on par with Hannibal Lector, but he has that potential to be one of the classic cinematic villains.<br /><br />In the end, Saw was a good enough horror movie for fans of the genre. Though casual horror fans may be more shocked with the film's scenes and premise than hardened horror-aficionados. Saw could've been very good or great if not for its overexplanation of everything going on in the scene and the average acting performance of most of the cast. Tobin Bell's performance being the only real highlight of the entire group. The ending of Saw seems well-suited for sequels. I wouldn't mind seeing what new complex game Jigsaw has in mind for a new set of unworthies.</p></body></html>

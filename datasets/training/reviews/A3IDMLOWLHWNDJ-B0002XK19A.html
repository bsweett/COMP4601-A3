<meta name="summary" content="Ultimate "Spider-Man""></head><body><p>"I believe there is a hero in all of us. That keeps us honest. Gives us strength. Makes us noble."<br />- Aunt May gives her nephew a clue on how to deal with his secret arachnid problem in "Spider-Man 2"<br /><br />The best comic book movie ever. Ever.<br /><br />The saga of Peter Parker and his alter ego, Spider-Man, continues as Parker has to deal with losing one of his two jobs, slipping grades (web-swinging at night is not a form of studying), a Russian landlord, Harry Osborn's drunken revenge on Spider-Man, and, worst of all, his life long crush, Mary Jane Watson, announces she's engaged to an astronaut that, adding insult to injury, is the son of J. Jonah Jameson, New York's tighest tight wad, publisher of the cities paper "The Daily Bugle", and Peter's boss. When Peter gives up being Spider-Man (thats after losing his web making abilities from psychological stress), things go from bad to worse as a new nemisis rises in the form of the six-armed mad scientist Otto Octavious.<br /><br />Man, think you've had a bad day?!<br /><br />"Spider-Man 2" is easily one of the best sequels made (right up there with "The Godfather II", The Empire Strikes Back", "Aliens", & "Terminator 2"). Sam Raimi's direction is at his best (yeah, that includes "A Simple Plan" & "The Evil Dead" films) and, again takes extreme care of bringing the comic book storyline to life.<br /><br />The cast is back and is in great form (it was also great to see cameos from Cliff Robertson & Willem Dafoe). You could almost peel the angst & heartache from Peter Parker right off the screen!<br /><br />The action sequences are instant classics, especially, the bank robbery scene & the subway car battle.<br /><br />I could go on all day, but, go see this movie - NOW.<br /><br />Stop reading.<br /><br />Go. Shoo.<br /><br />One other thing - three words...<br /><br />Venom. Summer. 2007.<br /><br />**It's been almost 3 long years since "Spider-Man 2" hit theaters & with the third installment less than a month away, Sony has decided to re-release "S-M 2" in a "2.1" version with 8 minutes of additional footage. Is it worth the upgrade? In simple terms - No. There are a couple of bits & pieces of fight scenes inserted back into the film, a scene between Mary Jane & her best friend that slows the movie down (MJ's best friend is actress Vanessa Ferlito who plays Butterfly in "Death Proof", the second film of "Grindhouse"), & a few other alternate or extended takes. The bonus disc is nothing short of delving too deeply into the visual effects aspect of the film (it goes to the point of boredom). If you can get this for under ten bucks, like I did, you will happy.**</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A sad case of "The preview for the movie is more exciting then the actual movie""></head><body><p>Think you've had a bad day?  Well, you haven't been on board a gigantic ocean liner that's been hit by a rogue tidal wave, capsized, and then is subsequently flooded while the few survivors try desperatly to escape before the big boat plunges to the bottom of the ocean.<br /><br />Poseidon was (along with the as-of-this-writting, unreleased "Snakes on a plane") the one big movie that I was looking forward to in 2006.  It had everything going for it.  An incredibly cool trailer, a great concept, state of the art CGI effefts, and a director who has had more then his fair share of water films.  It had everything going for it, and had all the elements of a blockbuster summer action movie.<br /><br />Alas, it was not to be.<br /><br />What went away here?  Perhaps it's the pacing and the timing.  A common complaint for Titanic when it came out way back in 1997 is that it took too long to get to the actual sinking.  Here, we get to the sinking in what feels like ten minutes.  In no time flat the boat has been hit by the wave, is upside down, and the escape attempt beings.  After that it's just bang, bang, bang as the film moves from one scene to another, barely giving you any time to catch your breath.<br /><br />This is probably the films greatest weakness.  It just moves far too quickly.  As an aspiring film editor, i'm aware that all the elements that don't add to the plot or the action at hand need to be cut out, but I just couldn't help but feel that a LOT of good material was cut out to try and keep the movie going as quickly as possible.  And when you cut out such material, your movie may go faster, but it looses  lot in the process, and I think that's what happened with Poseidon.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of James Cameron's Titanic is that it took the time to introduce it's charachters, build thier relationships and make us care about them.  By doing so, the movie was more gripping as the ship was sinking because we cared about Jack and Rose as the ship sank (I admit it, I cried when Jack turned into a popsicle).  Here, your charachters are nameless generic people (old guy, mom and kid, rouge anti-hero) who's names you forget five seconds after the credits start rolling.  Although the film does try to do some development, it just doesn't work.  I diddn't care for any of our heros (save for Richard Dreyfus, because it's always cool to see elderly people rise up to escape disaster), and I wasn't really sad when any of them died.  I will say this however, Poseidon does bend the rules a bit when it comes to charachter deaths.  Just like the shark film Deep Blue Sea, you never really know who's going to die.  One death in paticular, is given to a charachter who I thought for sure was going to live, and it suprised me when he/she died.<br /><br />The film isn't helped by the dialogue.  Now, to be fair, it is hard to write dialogue that doesn't sound expositional and i'm sure the scriptwritters tried hard, but the dialoge just sounds...well...artificial.  It's structured in a way that gives us the charachter's background and thier stories while trying to make us care about them.  Sadly, it doesn't work.  There are a few moments where the dialogue is actually silly.  When one of our heros says (in repsponse to the dad heading towards the disco room), "What?  You got an urge to dance now?"  I couldn't help but raise my hand in the John Travolta disco style, much to the laughter of other people in the theater.  When people in the audience are giggling and laughing at some of what is said on screen in a disaster movie, that can't be a good thing.<br /><br />In a way, Poseidon is just an excuse to go and watch big things happen on screen.  And this is the film's greatest strength.  It's a visual movie.  It's not a charachter driven epic, rather, it's a big action movie that spent the time and money on the visual effects, and it shows.  From the very cool capsizing sequence to the final plunge of the liner, Poseidon does hit the mark when it comes to great visuals.  Unfortunitly, the best moments are scattered throughout the film (such as the capsizing at the beginning and the final sinking at the end).  The rest of the time, we get pretty good visuals, but these just aren't as spectacular as the big stuff.<br /><br />Now, inevitably, comparisons are come up between Poseidon and Titanic, and in a way they are to be expected.  Both films are about sinking ships and the people on board.  The sad thing is, Titanic is just better then Poseidon in almost every way.  It's bigger, it has a more epic feel, and it has charachters we care about.  It takes it's time building up to the big event and keeps the flow going nicely without being too quick or too slow.<br /><br />Sadly, Poseidon has everything backwards.  Poseidon is full of charachters we don't care about, it moves far too quickly and relies more on big visuals over a good story.<br /><br />I really don't like giving this movie a low score because I had high hopes for it, and it is clear that Mr. Peterson and his crew put a lot of effort into making it (the design of the sets and the movie are quite good), but it just moves far too quickly and pretty much ignores charachters in favor of big effects. If you do want to see it, go in expecting a (very) fast paced movie that's big on visuals and don't go in expecting gripping charachters and complex relationships.</p></body></html>

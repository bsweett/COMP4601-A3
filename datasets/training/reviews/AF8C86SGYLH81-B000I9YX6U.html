<meta name="summary" content="Was That Robin WIlliams or Jack Nicholson?"></head><body><p>"One Hour Photo" does for Robin Williams what "The Shining" did for Jack Nicholson.  This intelligent, terrifying, realistic masterpiece is destined to be one of the screens best directed, edited and scripted films...period.  It will stand the test of time and Robin has shown a versatility (i.e. "Insomnia" earlier this summer) that ranks him right up there with the legends of film.  <p>This film left the audience in awe.  No one left their seats when the credits started to roll.  It is mesmerizing, haunting and compelling.  What makes it such a creepy thriller is the fact that this flick is REAL!  It can, and probably is, the story of what is going on right in our own backyards.  <p>I never write about plots or storylines.  I can only tell the potential viewer that this is a must if you like intelligent drama, thrills, believability and TERROR.  I will never be able to look into Robin Williams' eyes with the same understanding I had back in the days of "Mrs. Doubtfire" and "Jumanji".<p>This film has Oscar written all over it!!!</p></body></html>

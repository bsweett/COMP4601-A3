<meta name="summary" content="A chilling tale told right"></head><body><p>First off, I'm a huge Stephen King fan (since the 5th grade), and I was excited to see his most popular short story on the big screen. The acting was decent all around, but nothing special. The CGI looked below par at times, but was effective and chilling for the most part. The biggest complaint most people will have is with the ultra depressing ending. It is totally different from the book, and it doesn't really seem to fit the rest of the movie. I must admit that I liked the anti-hollywood approach Frank Darabont took. Not a bad try from a great Stephen King adapter. I mean this guy did give us The Shawshank Redemption (which was even better than King's book) and The Green Mile.</p></body></html>

However, the movie tells more about the creator than it does about feminism. This was by far the worst movie Nicholas Cage has ever starred in, and has topped my list for being one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although the trailer makes this movie look amazing and full of suspense and horror, it unfortunately contains neither.<br /><br />Nic Cage goes in search of his lost daughter in "The Wicker Man" and runs afoul of an isolated community of pagans. This remake of an old Chris Lee flick has little suspense and nothing to hold the attention, as Cage literally scrambles about the countryside, thinking he has glimpsed his kid first here and then there. Some of his search becomes downright comical, especially in a scene where he is trapped overnight in a cistern. Cage's character is allergic to bees, and there's a scene involving torture-by-bees where Cage utters what is destined to become an immortal line: "Oh God, not the bees!" Ellen Bursteyn of "The Exorcists" fame is wasted here as the head of the mysterious coven, much the way veteran horror actress Alice Krige was underutilized for a similar role in "Silent Hill".<br /><br />The beginning of the movie starts out fair enough, but as the movie pushes its way down you have to make more and more leaps of faith. And then, the bad dialog comes pouring out in the final 20-30 minutes. From "I'm going to find Rowan and what I need from you is to stay out of my f---ing way!" to "Ahhhh, my legs!!" the movie gets some really silly dialog...and considering its a LaBute film, its a shame to see his talent for dialog go to pot.<br /><br />The big questions, however, are "Is it better than the original?" and "Is it worth it?" It is arguably worse than the original. It is vastly different and in some aspects better and other aspects much much worse. But, it isn't worth it.</p></body></html>

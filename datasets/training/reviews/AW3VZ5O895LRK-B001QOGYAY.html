This has a very similar look and feel to it, especially in terms of what an afterlife and heaven might look like. The premise is the same as that film as well: someone dies a very violent and sudden death and suddenly finds herself in the afterlife, trying to reach back to her family.  In this situation the girl has been murdered by her neighbor, Stanley Tucci, who is a serial killer. I read about half of the novel when it first came out but I found it too depressing and couldn't finish it. The movie is not as depressing which makes it easier to experience that the novel.  This is NOT a "who done it."  You know exactly "who done it" within the earliest parts of the movie. This is also not a movie about a serial killer. It is simply a given that he is one and murders her.  Tucci does a very good job in a thankless role.  The actress playing the girl is also quite good and Marc Wahlberg, as usual, turns in his usual superior acting job. Peter Jackson of LORD OF THE RINGS  fame directs and he certainly makes this material as palatable and visual as it can be made.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Positive, if not uplifting conclusion!"></head><body><p>Jack appeared to have died in the gulf War, but then, did he die?  He wound up walking along a road in Maine where he met a girl and her mother, but when a cop was killed, did he do it?<br /><br />He was sent to a hospital for the criminally insane.  His treatment included being drugged and placed in a mortuary locker in a straight jacket, where he had out-of-body experiences and saw the past, and the future, or did he?<br /><br />This apparently cruel treatment, being locked in a morturary locker, seems to have worked by putting Jack in another dimension, and allowing him to solve otherwise unsolvable problems in his mind.<br /><br />At the end of the movie he was able to lock himself into a future existence through the straight jacket and the locker, but was that real, or was it in his mind, and did it matter?<br /><br />In some odd way, this movie reached a positive, if not uplifting conclusion.  It took a while to get there and I'm not all that sure it was worth it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cary Grant goes to Mount Rushmore--not just for the sight-seeing!!"></head><body><p>XXXXX<br /><br />Movie`s hero:  "My wives divorced me."<br />Movie's heroine: "Why?"<br />Hero: "They said I lived too dull a life."<br /><br />The above dialogue is found near the end of this classic suspense movie that is even today unparalleled in producing an optimal combination of plot, humour, action, mystery, and intrigue without resorting to clich&eacute;s.  It was directed by "The Master of Suspense," the great Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />Look for Hitchcock's characteristic brief cameo appearance after the opening credits.  Some say that there is a second cameo.<br /><br />Briefly, our hero in this movie, mid-mannered advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), is plunged into the bizarre world of spy (James Mason), counterspy (the heroine in this movie played by Eva Marie Saint), is kidnapped, framed for murder, chased, and even crop-dusted.  I should also mention that he "visits" Mount Rushmore and gets up-close to the faces of former U.S. presidents (Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Lincoln) carved on the mountain.<br /><br />The debonair Cary Grant effectively carries this movie.  (This was Grants fourth and final teaming with Hitchcock.)  Kudos must also go to the terrific supporting cast of Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Martin Landau (who plays the spy's main henchman), Jesse Royce Landis (who plays Thornhill's mother where in real-life Landis was only eight years older than Grant) and Leo G. Carroll (who plays the head of the C.I.A.).<br /><br />Another key ingredient of this movie is its background music.  This fantastic orchestral score was composed by Bernard Herrmann.  It effectively adds to each scene.<br /><br />Where does the movie's title come from?  There are actually many theories for its origin.  Personally, I think it comes from the fact that as the movie proceeds, Thornhill travels north on Northwest Airlines.  (One of the original titles for this movie was "The Man in Lincoln's Nose.")<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2004) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has eight interesting extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is one of those movie gems that, in my opinion, deserves to be called a "classic."  Roger Thornhill's ex-wives were wrong.  He definitely does not have a dull life!!<br /><br />Recommendation: watch this movie on as large of a screen as possible.<br /><br />(1959;  2 hr, 15 min;  wide screen;  46 scenes;  colour)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></body></html>

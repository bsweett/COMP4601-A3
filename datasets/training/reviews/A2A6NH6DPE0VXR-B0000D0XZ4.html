<meta name="summary" content="More drama than action but still a good movie"></head><body><p>Although the Hulk isn't your typical comic book movie that you could watch over and over again like Spiderman it's still good. It's slow and  doesn't have as much action as you'd expect. It does have a nice science fiction tone to it though. It reminded me of some of those science fiction movies from the 80's. Sorta like Altered States with William Hurt or even Darkman. It's more like those movies than it is like the old tv show. I mean it has that plot where a scientist transformed from science and his g/f is trying to save him. <p>  When he does transform it gets silly once he starts jumping from mountain to mountain. I don't know if he had a super jumping ability in the tv show or the comic but it's pretty silly. The movie had too many scenes with him just jumping around too. It may of worked for Ang Lee to have people jumping and flying in Crouching Tigar, Hidden Dragon but it doesn't work in the Hulk. Also when a helacopters are chasing him around, it reminded me too much of that bad 1998 Godzilla movie. The Hulk looks too cartoonish too. They should have just colored the WWE's Brock Lesner green lol. <p>  I still liked it though, some of the action was fun such as the Hulk vs super genetic dogs. The performances by Eric Bana "Black Hawke Down", Nick Nolte, Jennifer Connely and Sam Elliot are all strong. I hope that the sequel is more focused and has more action though. Hey X-Men 2 was better than the first one so maybe Hulk 2 will be better as well.</p></body></html>

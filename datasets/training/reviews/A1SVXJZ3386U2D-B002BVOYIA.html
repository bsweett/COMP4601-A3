Most of us have come to understand that the world stood by while genocide was taking place in this country.  However, at the same time, a massive military intervention ocurred in the Balkans over "ethnic cleansing".  There was a definite issue over whether or not American and European countries were willing to aid Europeans in trouble but not Africans in greater trouble.  It is an issue many people still struggle with.  Upon viewing "Hotel Rwanda" many will be inclined to agree that the world did not care enough about the fate of Black Africans to intervene in their behalf.  I'm not completely certain whether the movie suggests this because it is the truth or whether it is the true because the movie suggests it.  However, I have no problem with the movie's efforts to make a statement on the issue.<br /><br />This is a very good movie about one man's heroic efforts to protect roughly 1200 people who otherwise would probably have been killed.  I understand that this is based on actual events and I am glad that this individual's bravery has been presented for the world to acknowledge.  I found the suspense, frustration and fear to be very well developed in "Hotel Rwanda".<br /><br />My main issue with "Hotel Rwanda" is that I had to play back a number of scenes in the movie because I had no idea what had just been said.  I had to replay some scenes three or more times.  There is an accent of the actors that was difficult for me to easliy understand.  This may have been a issue unique to me and my mild hearing problem.  However, if I saw this movie in a theater without the ability to replay the various scenes, I may have had an even harder time understanding who represented what.  As it was there was a lot that was explained too briefly for me to always be sure what was going on, why, and how some people were related to others.  That may seem to some like I'm quibling over minor points and missing the big picture.  However, I felt that it inhibited me from being able to fully appreciate the big picture.<br /><br />I thought Don Cheadle made a case for himself as a serious actor.  However, after the complaints I heard about his not receiving the recent Best Actor Oscar, I'm afraid I expected more that I got.<br /><br />This is a very good movie and one I would readily encourage others to watch.  I did not think, however, that is is a "great" movie.</p></body></html>

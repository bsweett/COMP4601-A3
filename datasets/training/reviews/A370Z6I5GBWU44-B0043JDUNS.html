<meta name="summary" content="Fairly enjoyable sequel"></head><body><p>I don't read the Iron Man comic series, so I can't compare the canon in the comic and this movie, so my review is based solely on my impression of the film itself and what little I do know of the Marvel and Iron Man universe.<br /><br />The visuals and action was sweet. The fight scenes were thrilling. Ivan Vanko was played well and I liked the actor chosen for the role. The story was enjoyable and believable, with convincing villains and two-faced politicians. I enjoyed Iron Man 1 more than I did this, but the second installment of this film is a definite solid movie and more than worthy of four stars.</p></body></html>

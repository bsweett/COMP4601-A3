While I thought it was funny and entertaining, there wasn't much going on in this film. The cast is very good with lots of quirky characters and it is certainly worth seeing, it just doesn't go anyhwere. You might want to check it out on cable before you buy it. This may grow on me with repeat viewings. Until it does, I rate it 3 1/2 stars.</p></body></html>

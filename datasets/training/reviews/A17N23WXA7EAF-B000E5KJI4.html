<meta name="summary" content="More Gay than Gladiator"></head><body><p>I just saw Troy last night and I've got to say that it was more gay than "Gladiator". Yes, both films show scantily-clad, muscle men sweating, getting dirty, duking it out and professing love of one thing or another.<br /><br />In "Gladiator", the homo-erotic components is a little more subtle. Maximus is totally hot and Commodus is not. Commodus' dad, Marcus Aurelius has sublimated home-or-sect-chew-all attraction for Maximus and of course Maximus responds to it positively by going out onto the battle field with nothing more than a jock strap and some armor in order to cut off some German heads. Commodus is jealous and so he kills his dad, but then he wants to assume his father's role by consumating his (and his father's) attraction to Maximus. At first this takes the form of a loyalty enticement but when Maximus rebuffs this, Commodus unleashes a chain of murderous events that result in Maxiums performing in the Colloseum with a jock strap and some armor, a lot of tight, sweaty muscle men and even a few animals. Go Maximus! Anyway, Commodus transforms himself from observer to participant by doing a little disabling S&M routine on Maximus and then playing with him in the arena which is both scripted homo-erotic behavior and flagrant exhibitionism. So much for "Gay-ladiator".<br /><br />"Troy" ambitiously sets out to out-gay "Gladiator". From the beginning  the eye of the homo-erotic hurricane is Achilles played by Brad Pitt. My what a bad boy Achilles is. He's late for battle with Thesaly because he's sleeping in late (nood) with a couple of Ancient Greek chicks who look like a couple of Ancient Greek boys. This movie is clever about that because it gives the chicks the same hair style as the little servant boy and fails to show their distinctive feminine traits such as their love tunnels, fun seats, and chest-o-plenty.<br /><br />Achilles shows up at the battle field where he performs homo erotic combat with a total leather man from Thesaly. Then he goes home and plays with his cute little cousin, whacking wooden swords around and giggling while wearing cute blue dresses and having his hair sort of braided in blue.<br /><br />Then it's off to Troy which might as well be a gay disco spread out on the beach at day light. BOM PID DEEEEE, BOM PID DEEEE, BOM BOM BOM will you just look at all those scantily clad muscle men charging around on the beach and jumping on and stabbing each other!<br /><br />Ever the narcisist, it isn't enough for Achilles merely to do Hector. He also has to drag his body around the city wall behind his chariot boasting in a sort of modern prison movie manner, "Yeah, Hector: I DID him!" Achilles also shows as much of his nude body as he can get away with AND...<br /><br />  he shows his sweet sensitve side not to mention his pouty bad boy nature.<br /><br />Oh and that combat scene between delicate little Paris and husky, aggressive Meneleus--c'mon. Gay! Gay! Gay! It's soooooooo gay!<br /><br />Not that there's anything wrong with that.</p></body></html>

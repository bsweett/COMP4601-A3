After some ugly legal problems, their supering days are over. As cramped and constraining as those idenitites are, they are the only identities left. Then, at the peak of Mr. Incredible's mid-life crisis, the call comes from a mysterious source, and --<br /><br />Well, a lot happens, but you'll see that for yourself. Pixar gives good reason to sit through it, more than just Edna, Mirage (a Storm look-alike), and the self-declared Incredi-boy. Mr. and Mrs. Incredible have a lot to deal with, as in any marriage, and the super life is the least of it.<br /><br />The older children, Dash and Violet, are good characters, but a lot more could have been done with them. Violet, especially, is at an early teen age that can be very complicated, but breezes through it with surprising ease. I like the Incredible kids, but I would have liked more development of both characters.<br /><br />Oh, and yes. Keep watching. The littlest one does have "special needs."<br /><br />This is good, silly fun. It has characters worth caring about, and enough in it to be worth seeing again. Enjoy!<br /><br />//wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release of the movie</p></body></html>

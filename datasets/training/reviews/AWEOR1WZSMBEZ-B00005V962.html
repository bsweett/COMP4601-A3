<meta name="summary" content="Too star studded...shallow plot"></head><body><p>Despite the movie's main character being Danny Ocean, there were too many characters in the film.  To be specific, the film was too star studded to have the needed audience pull where the plot would have failed.  Moreover, I don't have any sympathies for a bunch of thieves &amp; a ruthless casino owner.  Honestly speaking, to hell with both of them.  The love/romantic scenes between Tess &amp; Danny were too forced.  Actually, I don't think it would have made any difference at all if they were all together deleted from the roll.  &amp; what kind of a woman would have moved from one man's arm to the other &amp; back?  Obviously, this remake capitalized on the actors' big name &amp; reputation.  A pity, they could have looked for better roles that would give justice to their talents.</p></body></html>

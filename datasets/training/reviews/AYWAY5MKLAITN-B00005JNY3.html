<meta name="summary" content="The Skeleton Key Opens New Doors."></head><body><p>Highly unpredictable and fluid in it's approach. It's the age-old tale with a twist. Girl has nursing home job, girl quits nursing home job, girl applies for nursing job all the way out in new orleans.<br /><br />But, the big kicker is that the house in which she has to do the "caring" is at an old run down mansion where ghosts may or may not be haunting the grounds. What makes this movie natural is it's approach. You'd think that we would grow tired of the main character, but, in reality, the main character Caroline(Kate hudson) has the same views as the audience and does not believe in mystical voo-doo.<br /><br />What I liked about this film is the fact that you never knew what was going to happen next. The plot and dialogue, I have to say, was very chess-like. Be on the lookout for characters in this one who try to Outsmart each other with the information that they have and the information that they gain.<br /><br />Oh, but my true favorite is the ending of this movie. Totally unexpected and totally orginal.<br /><br />This is a movie you must see. It will definetly give you the willies!</p></body></html>

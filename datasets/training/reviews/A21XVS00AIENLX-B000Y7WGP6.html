The action is definitely adrenaline-pumping and leave your nerves raw which action-movie goers will love.  The movie needed to turn down 12 ratchets and could have used a bit more character development.  So much so fast that you could barely get the story put together.<br /><br />I'd skip it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE RIVER OF THE SECRETS."></head><body><p>&quot;Mystic River&quot;, Clint Eastwood's most recent film, explores the dark side of the human being, that side that keeps terrible secrets and haunting memories from the past. It's a movie emotionally charged with situations that can be very dramatic, so the only way that this movie could have been well made, was counting with a good director and excellent performances.<br /><br /> Thankfully &quot;Mystic River&quot; has an impressive cast that successfully contributed to create this complex movie. In the wrong hands, this movie could have been merely a good film. Clint Eastwood managed to get an excellent performance from everybody in this movie. From the big stars to the supporting cast, every actor in &quot;Mystic River&quot; did a terrific job.<br /><br /> Without a doubt Sean Penn's performance in &quot;Mystic River&quot; is outstanding and he deserved every award that he got for his role of Jimmy Markum, a multi-dimensional character. Tim Robbins is excellent in his portrayal of a very dark character, a man tormented by his personal demons, and his complex performance also granted him some nominations and awards. Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney, Tom Guiry, Adam Nelson and Robert Wahlberg created very human and believable characters, their performances help to get the audiences involved in the plot, making &quot;Mystic River&quot; a very interesting story from beginning to end.<br /><br /> &quot;Mystic River&quot; is a very good movie, one of the finest of the 2003 class, and thanks to its great artistic quality, it's a very recommendable film.</p></body></html>

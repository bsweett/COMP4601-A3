It really depends on whether you love or hate this movie. Personally, I was transported away to this cinematic dreamland for the entire running time. Kerry Conran's labour of love is an unabashed tribute to the old pulp serials of the `20s and `30s (Doc Savage, Flash Gordon, etc.). It succeeds where previous pulp serial homages of the `90s failed (The Shadow, The Phantom, Dick Tracy). Like those films, Sky Captain successfully captures the look and feel of these vintage serials but, most importantly, it also stays true to their spirit-something that these other movies failed to do (The Rocketeer as the lone exception).<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by producer Jon Avnet. Avnet takes us through the filmmaking process in an engaging way that is also very informative. He talks quite eloquently about his role-how he allowed Conran to realize his vision but on a large budget-and mentored by him.<br /><br />Also included is another commentary track with Conran, his brother and the film's production designer Kevin Conran, animation supervisor Steve Yamamoto and visual effects supervisor Darin Hollings. Students of special effects will enjoy this informative commentary.<br /><br />"Brave New World: Chapter 1 and 2" are two making of featurettes that provide a fascinating look at how this production came together. These docs are refreshingly free of an excess of clips from the movie and a slick, over-produced look that resembles a commercial in favour of a more substantial look at how this film was made.<br /><br />"The Art of the World of Tomorrow" is hosted by Kevin Conran who describes the movie as "a comic book come to life." Among other things, he talks about the art and architecture that inspired their vision of New York City. It is interesting to see the sources that they drew upon for their distinctive cinematic world.<br /><br />"The Original Six Minute Short" allows you to look at what Conran made, pretty much on his own over several years, that would go on to impress people like Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow-enough that they would sign on to do the movie without even looking at a script.<br /><br />There are two deleted scenes, including a good scene where Dex rescues Joe and Polly from a cage, complete with unfinished effects.<br /><br />Finally, there is a two-and-a-half minute "Gag Reel" of blown lines and general goofing around on the set.<br /><br />Sky Captain has all the markings of a debut by a first-time filmmaker. There is a go-for-broke, let's-cram-everything-in-this-one attitude that a first-timer has a tendency to adopt because they don't know if there are going to get another chance. Sadly, Sky Captain failed at the box office thus insuring the unlikely prospects of a sequel. It's too bad because it presents a richly textured and detailed world with fun and exciting characters.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Big screenplay plot problems"></head><body><p>1. Audience doesn't care whether Talley's wife and daughter live or die.  The wife doesn't love him much and the annoying daughter is a loser.  Audience likes Walter Martin's kids much better.<br /><br />2.  Three thugs are just too young and not inspiring fear.  Even the silly stupid Mars was ludicrous as a madman.  He just looked like a geek playing a mad man.<br /><br />3.  Willis negotiating for money makes no sense as a ploy, and these black-booted thugs make no sense as to the lengths they'll go.<br /><br />It was not boring, I'll give it that.  There was action.  But I really wasn't inspired to give a damn whether Talley's wife lived or died in the end.  I almost hoped they died and he'd go off on his own and start a Hostage trilogy.<br /><br />Just a ridiculous uninspiring premise.</p></body></html>

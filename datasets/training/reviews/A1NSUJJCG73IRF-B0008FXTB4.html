<meta name="summary" content="Be Cool  (2005)"></head><body><p>Director:  F. Gary Gray<br /><br />Cast:  John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Vince Vaughn, Cedric the Entertainer, Andre Benjamin, Steven Tyler, Robert Pastorelli, Christina Milian, Paul Adelstein, Debi Mazar, The Rock, Harvey Keitel, Danny DeVito, James Woods.<br /><br />Running Time:  118 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for violence, sensuality, and language including sexual references.<br /><br />After conquering the movie business, Chili Palmer (John Travolta) grows weary of the cinema, and switches over to the music game when he gets a chance to team up with a friend's widow (Uma Thurman, entering the film in a very memorable way) to run a record label. After finding gold in a talented young singer (Christina Milian), Chili must first retrieve her recording contract from her shady manager (Harvey Keitel), outwit a dim, thugged-out-whiteboy wannabe producer (Vince Vaughn) and his homosexual, aspiring actor bodyguard (The Rock), negotiate a settlement of debt with a Suge Knightish producer (Cedric the Entertainer) and his gang (including Outkast's Andre Benjamin), and try to outsmart some Russian gangsters who are hot on his tail. All in a day's work in the record industry.<br /><br />It has been 10 years since Chili Palmer last graced the big screen (has it been that long?) in the Elmore Leonard adaptation, "Get Shorty." Impressed with star John Travolta's performance, novelist Elmore Leonard took it upon himself to write a sequel novel, which is the basis for "Be Cool." Chili is arguably Travota's finest role, utilizing the actor's rarely used gifts for deafeningly calm coolness and charm. "Be Cool" also reunites Travolta with Uma Thurman, his dance partner in both love and heroin in "Pulp Fiction." Their chemistry is terrific, providing the backbone of the film while every other actor gets to run around chewing the scenery. It's tremendous fun to see Travolta in this role again; however, in those 10 years, there have been many personnel changes in front of and behind the camera, which occasionally disrupts the Chili fun of "Be Cool."<br /><br />"Be Cool", more so than its predecessor, leeches shamelessly and excessively off "Pulp Fiction", which by now is as common as imitating bullet-time from "The Matrix". What's sad is that "Be Cool" depends entirely on leeching off of "Get Shorty" while neglecting to develop its own plot; what you get is a short-lived sense of nostalgia sugar coated with some manufactured "oohs" and "ahs" you get from seeing the Black Eyed Peas and Steven Tyler on screen. While such technique may make for a nice 5-minute music video or Coca Cola promo, it doesn't make for proper storytelling. "Get Shorty" created much more tension with a lot less color, with the beef among rival mobsters playing out like a well choreographed dance of opposing chemical elements. "Be Cool" is more like a chaotic late afternoon preschool where all the kids are fighting for attention, sacrificing classiness for distracting noise.</p></body></html>

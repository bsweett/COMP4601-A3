<meta name="summary" content="Unconventional, thrilling, and stark. Real cinema."></head><body><p>I have often thought it would be fun to write the plot to a film which was genuinely reflective of how real life unfolds and where no concessions were made to the conventions and impulses of dramatic structure: where the set of narratives, while looking for all the world like they'll lead somewhere, are corrupted, interfered with, or simply lapse through inattention, and are consequently frustrated, transformed, reconstituted and restated on the fly, with no dramatic lesson or deeper metaphyiscal meaning, thus ruining everything before a satisfying outcome is allowed to occur. Not dramatically satisfying, sure, but at least it wold be honest and reflective of how life really is on our side of the silver screen.<br /><br />No Country For Old Men is that sort of film. A few commentators have taken it to task for its failure to live up to story-telling and character development conventions; the plots and histories to which it introduces us don't prescribe satisfying arcs: They start off well enough but are blown off course, interrupted, or subverted. Some see this as a shortfall; to me, it is very much the point.<br /><br />It happens, in small details as much as in the main narrative, right from the beginning: Texan everyman Llewellyn is distracted whilst walking through scrubland to retrieve a deer he has shot. He sees a transverse trail of blood, leading over a hill. He follows it, and as a result never gets to collect the deer: the arc is interrupted. The trail of blood leads to the grisly scene of an aborted drug deal. Bodies everywhere and a ring of shot-up pickups suggest it has not gone to plan: its arc was interrupted. Llewellyn is thereafter drawn, like a puppet on a string, by the unintended consequences of his own actions, fiat and the deliberate pursuit of others, to completely re-sculpt the trajectory of his life. That trajectory is itself interrupted (from the perspective of the narrative of the film) in a quite unexpected way.<br /><br />The unexpected interruption of arcs continues throughout, even in small details: We are introduced to plans and trajectories we know are about to be impaired: An elderly gas station attendant, facing down a man he gradually realises to be a psychopathic killer, recounts briefly the story of his life, and how he came to be at that point at that time. His would-be murderer, Anton Chigurh, flips a dime, and makes facile observations about the fate and destiny of himself, the coin, and the gas station attendant in the same place. Note also the entry and exit from the film of Carson Welles (and for that matter his employer) - both seemingly primed to make a significant dramatic contribution but not ever getting the chance to thanks to events beyond their control. The role of destiny, fate and chance in framing our existences looms large throughout this film.<br /><br />As does the idea of non-verbal, almost innate communication. Chigurh and the gas station attendant carry on what on its face is an anoydyne conversation, but both are entirely aware what is meant and intended. Later, Chigurh and Llewellyn sit either side of a closed door, neither knowing the other is even there, but a spookily unspoken, almost telepathic dialogue carries on between them. It is masterful film-making.<br /><br />And this is not to mention the wonderful cinematography, the clever direction, the assured acting, and the clever soundtrack - where even the absence of sound is as significant and suspenseful. No Country For Old Men is also no film for every man or woman: It's extremely violent and the tension is almost unbearable at times: if you're expecting a purely intellectual journey into the dark heart of the American psyche you might (literally) get a fright: it's an old fashioned hide-behind-the-sofa sort of film into the bargain as well.<br /><br />That said, a second viewing, where the suspense was largely removed, would be highly rewarding. A candidate for DVD release for sure.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A superb &quot;revision&quot; of a classic tale"></head><body><p>Tim Burton is, in my opinion, one of our great visionary filmmakers, and &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is yet another creative triumph. Inspired by the classic 19th century story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,&quot; by Washington Irving, this film depicts a United States that is just about to enter the &quot;modern&quot; age. Constable Ichabod Crane (a superb Johnny Depp) is sent to a rural New York village to investigate a series of murders--killings which the locals claim are the work of a supernatural fiend known as the Headless Horseman.<p>&quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; works on may levels: as historical &quot;costume drama,&quot; as mystery-thriller, as love story, as fantasy, even as satire. The sets, costumes, make-up, special effects, and sumptuous Danny Elfman score blend marvelously to create an atmosphere that is both creepy and romantic. The filmmakers have assembled an amazing ensemble cast of veteran character actors to support Depp and the luminous Christina Ricci (as Crane's love interest). I was also impressed by Marc Pickering as Young Masbeth, a brave boy who becomes Crane's right-hand man.<p>Depp is excellent in his role, yet another in a series of oddball outsiders and weird &quot;prophets&quot; which he has played to perfection over the years. Depp's Crane is eccentric, comic, heroic, and very appealing.<p>I think it's healthy to be suspicious of attempts to make movies out of literary classics. But &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is an attempt that works. The changes that have been made (most notably, changing Ichabod Crane from a schoolteacher to a police investigator) make sense and are handled deftly by the screenwriters. The gruesome violence may be a bit much for some viewers, but I did not find the violence to be gratuitous; rather, it is well-integrated into the overall plot and atmosphere. Overall, an excellent film.</p></body></html>

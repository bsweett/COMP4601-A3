The special effect is especially good when it showed Cherry Darling had a sub-machine gun attached to her right calf. She shot zombies with it. It's also good when it showed Cherry walked with the submachine gun used as her clutch.<br /><br />The bloody scenes in this film are more disgusting than horrifying.</p></body></html>

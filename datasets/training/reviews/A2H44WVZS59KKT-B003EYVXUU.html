Beware of who you invite into your home - you never know what kind of monster may be standing on the threshold.<br /><br />Chilling vampire tale starring children although the bullies are almost scarier than the vampire. SUPERB casting in all the roles.<br /><br />I've seen the original Swedish version, too <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYIXAW">Let the Right One In [Blu-ray</a>] and I actually liked the U.S. version much better.  I liked the actors in the U.S. version much more.  I do have to say that in most ways the U.S. version stayed very true to the Swedish version.<br /><br />This was probably the scariest and most realistic vampire film I've seen to date.  And the most original.</p></body></html>

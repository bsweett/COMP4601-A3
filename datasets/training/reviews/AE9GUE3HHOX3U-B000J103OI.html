Meryl Streep plays Miranda Priestley so convincingly, it makes you hate her character to the core.  I hope Meryl isn't like Miranda in real life, if so that would be sad.  I personally would not put up with anything Andie went through with Miranda and her crappy attitude.  I would have spat in her face and walked out on the job.  If that's really how the fashion industry operates, I think it's pathetic and they need to get over themselves because everything they design goes out of style anyways.  This film captures the attitude of the fashion industry and the acting is fantastic by Meryl Streep, I wish she would have won the oscar.</p></body></html>

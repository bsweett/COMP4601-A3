Not only does this movie have lots of action, it has a good touch of humor as well.  Follow sparrow through the film trying to keep from tangling with Old Davy Jones.  Can he find the Dead Man's chest? Watch this movie and find out, well worth buying the DVD (either edition single or double disc).  Only complaint, it is a bit longer, and almost lost my interest for a second, but then sucked me right back in.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Assessing what really matters"></head><body><p>Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) likes his unencumbered lifestyle--as a corporate downsizing consultant, he spends most of the year traveling across the country, breaking the news to the formerly employed that their positions are "no longer available" and "preparing" them for the next stage of their life by handing them a packet.  A number of events conspire to cause him to reevaluate his life: he is assigned the task of showing the ropes to a young up-and-comer (Anna Kendrick) who wants to rock his industry, he meets a woman (Vera Farmiga) that he actually wants to spend more time with, and a sister (Melanie Lynskey) he rarely sees decides to get married.<br /><br />This perceptive film about life, work, and the deep insecurities we all feel in these precarious economic times reminds us to cherish the people in our lives.  It is interesting that such a famously confirmed bachelor as Clooney stars in such a paean to the comforts of married life--sort of an "only Nixon could go to China" situation.  The entire cast is wonderful.  This film has moments that are unsettling, sad, and radiantly happy, making for a complete emotional experience.</p></body></html>

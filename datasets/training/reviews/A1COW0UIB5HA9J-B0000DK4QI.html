Soon they discover that a sneaky alien creature begins to hunt the team down then slaughter them one by one, as Duke must try to find a way to defeat the unseen enemy force.<br /><br />A supsenseful and really violent Science Fiction action adventure that has became a genre favorite even with it's box-office success and fan base. There are some gore in this movie that may not be for the squeamish, but it's action and pacing never lets down the viewer especially with it's good special effects, the creature itself is quite a unique kind of alien monster that is fully armed with invisibility mode and all kinds of deadly weapons designed and created by Stan Winston.<br /><br />This special 2-Disc Edition is an improvement over the original badly transfered bareboned with only trailer DVD, it has a great and informative audio commentary by the director. The features on disc 2 are just cool, it has featurettes, documentary, Never-before-shown outtakes, deleted scene, still gallery and more.<br /><br />A must have DVD and movie for fans of action, adventure, horror, and Science Fiction everywhere.<br /><br />Also recommended: " The Thing" ( 1982), " Aliens", " Predator 2", "Alien", " Total Recall", " The Running Man", " The Terminator", " Terminator 2", " Alien3", "Alien Resurrection", "The Deadly Spawn", " Contamination", " Pitch Black", " Lifeforce", " Killer Klowns from Outer Space", " Jurassic Park", "Independence Day", "Stargate", " The Matrix", " Ghost in The Shell", " Cannibal Ferox", " Cannibal Holocaust", " The Evil Dead", " Evil Dead 2", " Event Horizon", " Creature ( 1985)", " Critters 1 & 2", " IT!

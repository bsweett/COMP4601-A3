<meta name="summary" content="Morbidly delightful."></head><body><p>There's this scene in An American Werewolf in London where our protagonist is having a conversation with the decomposed corpse of his best friend while watching a pornographic movie in an adult theater.  There are others in the screenroom that eventually reveal themselves to be victims of our tragic werewolf.  Why are they here?  To convince the poor man to commit suicide.  "You gotta kill yourself, man.  Tonight's another full moon."  He then proceeds to change into the beast and terrorizes the movie theater.<p>I bring this one scene up because it had a profound effect on me when I first saw this at eight years old (I know, I know...an eight year old shouldn't have been watching this).  I had never scene anything as twisted before and I've rarely seen anything like it since.  That's the most important thing about this film.  It has never been successfully imitated.<p>Two American best friends are backpacking through England when one night on an lonely road out in the old country, they're attacked by a vicious creature.  One man dies, the other receives near-fatal injuries.  After a brief stay in the hospital, the protagonist is taken in by his lovestruck sympathetis nurse.  The visions of his deceased best-friend begin to haunt him delivering a terrifying prophecy:  On the night of the first full moon, you'll become the creature that attaked you.<p>______________________________________________________<p>I recently saw what I consider to be a disaster of a movie...Van Helsing.  I bring this up because of the interesting werewolf transformation in the film.  The werewolf would convulse and then proceed to rip his flesh from his body revealing the monster underneath.  All of this was done photorealistically as CGI.  But with all the realsim, it still doesn't have the impact of the first werewolf transformation in An American Werewolf in London.  But why?  Are we desensitized as movie-goers?  Personally, I think it comes down to style.  Modern filmakers are too obsessed with how real their effects look that they've become lazy convinced that the realistic CGI will be enough to satisfy the audience.  They've forgotten how easy it is to creep someone out.  Modern special effects should inhance the atmosphere set by a monster...not replace it.</p></body></html>

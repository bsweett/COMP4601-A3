<meta name="summary" content=""From Dusk Till Dawn" to the 100th power...but with zombies!!!"></head><body><p>"Planet Terror" is one of the most unique films I've seen in quite a while. It's a sort of parody/ tribute to the drive-in/ exploitation movies of the 1970s. Now here's my Top Ten Reasons Why You Should Watch "Planet Terror":<br />1) It's brought to us by Robert Rodriguez, the same man that gave us "From Dusk Till Dawn", so you know this is gonna be something interesting, and especially well-made.<br />2) ...and, like "From Dusk Till Dawn", this movie starts off serious but is able to do a 180 about 40 minutes into it. This basically means that the pacing of this movie is good and time really flies, even though it's about an hour and forty minutes long.<br />3) There's plenty of odd characters, and while there isn't any real plot, all the characters contribute to the charm and appeal of this movie.<br />4) A reason you MUST watch this movie, a girl has a machine gun for a leg! She doesn't get it until the last, twenty minutes or so, but when she DOES get become our loveable Machine Gun Sally...WATCH OUT!!! This includes when she shoots the ground and flies thirty feet over a wall like a comic book superhero. That's a clip you will DEFINITELY wanna watch again.<br />5) Gore, gore, gore!!! This movie is packed with plenty of horror-related action, alongside LOTS of headshots and the red stuff flies like ducks flying south for the winter.<br />6) Tom Savini makes an appearance as a police officer, and it's always cool to see Tom land a spot in a cool movie.<br />7) The whole film even feels like a sort of '70s movie, if you forget the fact that it's a tribute to these types of movies, so we get the nostalgic feel and classic sorta setting.<br />8) All the actors do a very good job at playing their roles, so this breathes even more life into the film.<br />9) There are so many, ridiculous moments, like the guy that jumps around like a martial artist and rips zombies apart one after another after another!!! This movie is chock full of awesome moments and true novelty ideas that put a real twist on this type of movie.<br />and Reason Number 10:<br />10) This movie is a real treat because it doesn't follow the rulebook on what a horror/action/exploitation movie should be. Like "From Dusk Till Dawn" it is such a novelty item and SO COOL, it's a movie you just can't watch once. It's a fun-filled, action-packed, zombie-raging movie that YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE SERIOUSLY! Just kick back, grab a bottle of your favorite iced tea, and let the DVD play.<br /><br />Well, if you made it this far into the review, I wanna say thanks!!! If you're looking for a fun, exciting, gory, and actually rather funny movie, "Planet Terror" is a newfound gem that's sure to withstand the test of time, and can almost be called this generation's "From Dusk Till Dawn". Robert Rodriguez sure is making a name for himself as a writer and director, because both these movies are flat-out awesomeness!<br />If you're looking for a horror/action-comedy movie that'll bring you a good time, "Planet Terror" will be your Knight in Bloody Armor...WITH the machine gun leg! LOL. Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></body></html>

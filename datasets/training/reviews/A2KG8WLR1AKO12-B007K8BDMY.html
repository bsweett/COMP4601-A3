<meta name="summary" content="Timothy Treadwell Hated Human Society"></head><body><p>Werner Herzog's documentary is excellent.  I thought it to be among the very best I've ever seen.  "Grizzly Man" deals with the crazed Timothy Treadwell who was doomed to eventually get himself killed.  The odds were against his ever reaching retirement age.  Treadwell so hated the civilized world that he deluded himself into believing that wild animals had more love to offer than other human beings. Amie Huguenard and the other women in his life were probably mere sex objects.  They were nowhere near as important as the grizzly bears.  It is obvious as you watch the film that Treadwell is increasingly becoming more unbalanced.  A group of men, for instance, visit his "private" island and are obviously non-threatening.  And yet, Treadwell imagines them to be the very opposite.  Some true believers (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060505915">The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements (Perennial Classics)</a>) seek their utopias in political systems such as Communism, Nazism or environmental radicalism.  Treadwell instead opted for anthropomorphic extremism.  This is a sure one-way ticket to madness and eventual suicide.  Sadly, Amie did not recognize the danger signals.  Experts believe that an older and perhaps desperately hungry bear saw them as an easy meal.  There is one consolation regarding the deaths of Treadwell and Huguenard: they never murdered people on behalf of their utopian vision.  Only these two individuals paid the ultimate price.  For that, we can be thankful.</p></body></html>

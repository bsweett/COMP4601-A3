While recently having to sit thru a horrible film that didn't have a drop of fear or intrigue, it is refreshing to see a film that knows how to be scary and have fun doing it. Credit director James Mangold for his stylish, noirish eye, and screenwriter Michael Cooney for concocting a devilish web of mystery and suspense. It's the kind of movie that you will know right off the bat that you will really get into. It all starts during a dark and stormy night. Of course!. It's raining heavily and roads out in the middle of Nevada have been washed out. A group of strangers have been forced to seek shelter at this seedy, off the road motel. They have all crossed paths just minutes before, and it is show thru flashbacks how each one got connected together and ended up at the motel. There is Ed(John Cusack), a limo driver with a past job that makes him a strong leader in working out the mystery. He is driving a washed up actress(Rebecca DeMornay, who despite a hair color change, still looks great). She is the epitome of a spoiled, rich starlet. Success starved, and not willing to spend time in some mundane motel that doesn't have room service. Then there is Ginny(Clea DuValle), and her new husband Lou, who seem to not be the happiest of newlyweds. There's motel manager Larry(John Hawkes), who has some interesting secrets of his own; prostitute Paris(Amanda Peet), who is turning 30 in a week and just wants to go back home to Florida to grow oranges; and a normal, suburban type family led by John C. McGinley of "Scrubs", along with his wife(Leila Kenzle from "Mad About You" fame), and young son Timothy. Then things get weird when a cop named Rhoades(Ray Liotta), shows up with a prisoner(Jake Busey), in tow. He was supposed to be transferring the prisoner when they got caught up in the storm. There are numerous other things that have gone on and more in depth descriptions of the people, but telling would be spoiling all of the twists and turns this movie will take and how it will keep you thinking. Suddenly, one by one, the stranded motorists begin getting knocked off. When you think one way, you are suddenly proven wrong and think another way, until you finally come to the conclusion that you have no idea what is going on. The mystery is mind boggling and the turns in the story are clever and a lot of fun to figure out. Although you won't. You think that the murderer can't quite possibly pull this off, but it's even more interesting trying to figure out just who is behind it. The performances here are all stand out. Cusack is his usual reliable self, and Liotta is always convincing in everything he does. The rest are all up to the task as well. Jake Busey as the prisoner is good too. Then again, put someone with the last name of Busey in a psycho role, and you usually get an interesting performance. The movie really gets you to think, and Mangold's direction and keen eye for setting up chills and suspense are right on. The rain, the motel, the atmosphere, they are all just as much a part of the cast and the main story as the cast and story itself. What I always love about movies like this that have an eclectic cast of characters and actors is that I love watching how the different personalities interact and how they either disintegrate in the madness, or change for the better because of it. I have to say that the ending, while it may seem like a disappointment, is still very well executed and wonderfully constructed. It is a nice twist, but it does damage, in some way, what you have invested in it up to that point. I wasn't really disappointed because I thought that they had done it in a very creative, and well imagined way. Some people missed that. I really don't know what else to say without getting too much into the movie and giving things away. "Identity" is a suspense thriller that brings respect and dignity back to the genre. See it!.</p></body></html>

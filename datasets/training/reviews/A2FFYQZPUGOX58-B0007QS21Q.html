<meta name="summary" content="Flawless Laws"></head><body><p>Fifteen years ago, Lawrence Robertson and Alfred Lanning founded U.S. Robotics (USR); Robertson supplied the hard-nosed business sense while Lanning provided the technical know-how.  Their Nestor Robots have since become the robots of choice; their last major hardware upgrade was the venerable Nestor-4 (NS-4).<br /><br />The NS-4 has become so pervasive that you can't walk down the street without encountering one.  They are reliable, polite, and have proven to be completely safe.  In spite of their immobile faces with doll-like eyes and slot-like mouths, most people have accepted them as fellow beings.<br /><br />As good as the NS-4s have been, they are showing their age.  At last, USR is about to release the NS-5; it's more intelligent; its face is flexible, with expressive eyes and a working mouth.  Unlike the NS-4, the NS-5 has a radio link with USR's mainframe (VIKI), which will transmit daily software and data updates.<br /><br />There is no need to stand in line for your upgrade; your new NS-5 will be trucked to you.  Upon arrival, it will place your old NS-4 in the truck, which will then take it to the USR landfill.  It will be stored in a large, stacked shipping container with others of its kind, where they can live out their remaining years.<br /><br />Like the NS-4s, the NS-5s are safe.  Hardwired into every NS-5 - including USR's VIKI core - are the "Three Laws of Robotics", developed by Dr. Lanning, who has stated these safety laws are "perfect."  Unfortunately the release of the NS-5 robot has been marred by the discovery of Lanning's crushed body in USR's lobby ... perhaps the laws are flawed after all. . . .<br /><br />Picture (Blu-ray 2008): 5.

<meta name="summary" content="Great performance."></head><body><p>The story of Margaret Thatcher, the first woman elected Prime Minister of England. The movie begins with her later years suffering from Alzheimer's and flashes back to her early days as a young woman and her time in office. The movie only provides a snapshot of who she is, and perhaps could have focused less on her current condition, and given more weight to her rise from an eager young woman to the leadership of Great Britain. The primary reason to see this one is for one of the great performance by Meryl Streep. The iconic actress is at her finest, and successfully delves into the role, transforming herself into "The Iron Lady." If you enjoy great acting, this is a good one to see.</p></body></html>

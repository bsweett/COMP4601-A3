<meta name="summary" content="A truly enjoyable masterpiece..."></head><body><p>Mistaken by a couple of hired thugs for an international spy and innocent in the murder of a diplomat, Cary Grant (armed only with undeniable charms and seductive shape) flees across the most audacious places of the United States, pursued by appropriately menacing villains (led by suave cold-hearted head James Mason and his henchman young Martin Landau) and shadowed by government agents... Somewhere in between is the sophisticated, glamorous and mysterious femme fatale Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), whose unpredictable devotions tremble between the extremes of good and evil...<br /><br />Will Grant slip away from his would-be killers? Does he clear his name after falsely being accused?<br /><br />Directed by a genius behind the camera and a "master of suspense," and featuring intrigue, comedy, romance, and danger--the crime at the U.N., the lethal crop duster attack in the middle of nowhere, Grant's unusually good exhibition at a Chicago auction, the sequence at an automobile plant, and the impressive climactic hunt across the Presidential faces carved into Mount Rushmore--Hitchcock celebrated his golden effort with his fourth and final masterpiece after 1954's Rear Window, 1958's Vertigo, and 1960's Psycho.</p></body></html>

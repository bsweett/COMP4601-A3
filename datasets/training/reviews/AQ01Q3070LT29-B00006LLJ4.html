<meta name="summary" content="I dislike the "Bleach-Bypass" color processing of the film."></head><body><p>Why is Steven Speilberg so insistant in using the "Bleach-Bypass" color processing in his films.  Minority Report would have been alot better with just normal colors.  The use of dark shadows can be very effective to create a cold and dampy feeling, and it can be done with normal colors and rich black & white, i.e. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CMJSU">The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset DVD</a> (1972) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9E">Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> (1941).  I am not a Tom Cruise fan at all, bit I sure do enjoy Colin Farrell being in this film.  Thanks to this DVD company for offering this DVD in Full Screen and Wide Screen.  I will watch and buy full-screen anytime. I wish film makers would stop using the "Bleach-Bypass" color in films.</p></body></html>

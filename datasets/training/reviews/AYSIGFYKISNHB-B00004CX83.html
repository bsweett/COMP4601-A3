<meta name="summary" content="Still A Great Batman Film"></head><body><p>Even though Batman Begins is the best Batman film yet, Batman {1989} is still a great film and a masterpiece. I love how they worked on the new Batman 2-disc DVD. The new transfer rocks and the really did a great job remastering the footage.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson's performance as The Joker hasn't changed a bit. In fact, everytime I watch this film and see his performance as The Joker, I just get excited. Even though Christian Bale took the title from Michael Keaton as the best Batman/Bruce Wayne, Keaton still is a excellent Batman.<br /><br />I love the new features in this DVD, like Shadow Of The Bat: The Cinematic Saga Of The Dark Knight 1-3, Batman: The Complete Robin Storyboards Sequence, Legends Of The Dark Knight: The History Of Batman and more.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Batman {1989}, get this DVD. Also, get Batman Returns.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fun, but pointless remake"></head><body><p>I really can't put it any clearer than my opening line; the original was far from perfect, but it achieved what it set out to, and was enough of a cult favourite that it inspired 4 lesser sequels (the mark of any true BLOCKBUSTER).<p>As with the shot-by-shot remake of Psycho, it's just another example of Hollywood's tiredness.  There's nothing new under the sun, so to hell with it, we'll just bring those apes out of mothballs.  <p>If was impressed with anything, it was the technical aspects of the film, the make-up artists, and the sound-editing.  It's truly a great sounding/looking DVD, but all the extras contained within do not compensate for what's basically an old, overdone concept.<p>If you're more into picking up DVDs to simulate the feel of a theatre, then by all means pick it up!  The rest of us will settle for excellent cinema instead.</p></body></html>

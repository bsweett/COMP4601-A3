<meta name="summary" content="Rwanda...A Story That Had to be Told!"></head><body><p>There can be little doubt that the greatest human tragedy of 2004 was the Asian tsunami which killed some 300,000 people.  In this one rumbling of the earth's crust, a great swathe of people have their lives snuffed out from Indonesia through Sri Lanka and India to as far a field as Somalia on the coast of Africa.  Nature is truly a cruel mistress.<br /><br />Yet how many people who were brought to tears by this tragedy and rushed to offer help realise that nearly a million people died in 1994 in the tiny nation of Rwanda?  But it's true and the world turned a blind eye.<br /><br />In an attempt to fill the vacuum, "Hotel Rwanda" is a truly great work of art.  The film eschews gratuitous violence as seen in a Hollywood horror film but, nonetheless, serves to remind the viewer of the hell that humans can inflict upon each other.  "Hotel Rwanda" is a must see film for 2005 and it deserves its three Oscar nominations.  One can only hope that it is looked on favourably by the Academy.<br /><br />Don Cheadle as the hero, Paul Rusesabagina, is a revelation.  What's more, this story needed to be told.  Rusesabagina is a 21st century hero in much the same way as Oskar Schindler was in the 20th century.  Cheadle plays a great part and I can only hope that others see the depth of his character.<br /><br />To all readers, see this film!  It is a story that is unknown to the bulk of humanity.  It is a story that is told with grace and impact.  Do not miss it!</p></body></html>

I realize that Scorsese takes some historical liberties with the plotline but everything about Tammany Hall was interesting to me.  I know that the director had been thinking about making Gangs for a couple of decades and his long-term planning certainly paid off.  I've seen it twice but both times I rewound to see the first fifteen minutes again as the introduction is absolutely priceless.  There are few better fight scenes that can be found than the one in the beginning of "Gangs of New York" where Lewis and his Natives square off with Neeson and his Dead Rabbits.  It's visually stunning.<br /><br />Personally, I now view Daniel Day-Lewis as being the world's greatest living actor.  For a refined, artistocratic Englishman to put forth such a magnificent, and buyable, performance as a maniacal killer was truly amazing.  Even his accent was perfect.  I can't say enough about his skills and presence.<br /><br />In juxtaposition, while Lewis is outstanding, Leonardo DiCaprio manages not to impress.  He is average in this role and really, when considering the talent around him, is actually a disappointment.  To me, the love story between DiCaprio and Diaz was the low point, in an otherwise stupendous, film.</p></body></html>

Even when watching "Big" in 1988, the premise on which this movie was based on, the main character was from a time that I didn't know.<br /><br />I felt so old watching "13 Going On 30" because I could very much relate to 1987, being 11 years old then, and I kept thinking, "That hair and makeup is so on target."  I remember wanting to skip over the horror and confusion of the teenage years myself then - skip past those annoying cliques and raging hormones - and just become an adult.  I also remember those cheesy hairstyles and the corny music (I rolled my eyes at the continuous stream of those god-awful 80's tunes, although the Go Go's "Head Over Heels" as the opening song was a great fit).<br /><br />No need to rehash the plot (the female version of "Big," with '90's references thrown in) but Jennifer Garner was cute in her role as the adult Jenna Rink, who realizes, how many people she hurt on her way to number one (including the very magazine she worked for - she was sabotaging her own magazine by continually supplying a stream of ideas to their main rival magazine).  Mark Ruffalo played the adult Matt, Jenna's former boyfriend, a guy who she carelessly tossed on her way to popularity.<br /><br />For those who expect that Jenna and Mark will meet again as adults and everything will turn out great because she went from being a teenager to an adult overnight are in for a surprise.  While they got themselves reacquainted as adults, in the end, Matt decides to marry someone else, telling Jenna, on his wedding day, that "you can't turn back the hands of time."  The damage that she did to him was irreversible (as it is in real life).<br /><br />Matt gives Jenna the dollhouse he built for her when they were teenagers and, going to the back of the house where he's getting married in, the wind blows the remainder of the wishing dust on Jenna, transporting her back to 1987, and the party she left while she was blindfolded in the closet (waiting for one of the popular guys to kiss her, a trick played on her by the clique she wanted desperately to become part of).<br /><br />She returns to the party, seeing what happened to her as an adult, kisses Matt, ditches the clique, and Jenna and Matt wind up marrying and moving into their house, after all.<br /><br />Too bad real life can't mirror celluloid.  If only it were possible to see what would have happened in the future ...</p></body></html>

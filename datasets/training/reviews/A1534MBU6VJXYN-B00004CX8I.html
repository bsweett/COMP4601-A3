<meta name="summary" content="A Stunning, Timeless Piece Of American Filmmaking"></head><body><p>In terms of movies that had deep, meaningful storylines, expert writing, great actors and great directors, no era can beat the 1970s'. One hardly can hardly argue with this assertion, since films like "The Godfather", "The Last Picture Show", "Nashville", "Taxi Driver", "The Godfather Part II" and this 1975 masterpiece based on Ken Kesey's novel all came from this era.<br /><br />In "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", Jack Nicholson plays Randall P. McMurphy, a slightly maniacal man who is placed in a state mental hospital for an evaluation. There he encounters a stunning group of social misfits, wackos and mentally challenged people (played adeptly by future stars Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif and Danny DeVito as well as renowned character actor Vincent Schiavelli). He also encounters Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a heartless woman whom McMurphy vows to drive crazy within one week. At first McMurphy is taken aback by his new surroundings. But as the film progresses, McMurphy developes a profound understanding for his fellow inmates, which ultimately helps him become a better man.<br /><br />This film is truly excellent. Although Nicholson had been making movies for quite some time and made some excellent films ("Easy Rider", "Five Easy Pieces", "Carnal Knowledge", "The Last Detail", "Chinatown"), this was the film that gave him his first of three Oscars and cemented him as the Brando-esque acting god he's considered as today. Louise Fletcher also won an Oscar for her fiery portrayal as Nurse Ratched. He plays the role with the kind of intensity possessed by classic movie villians like Norman Baits and even some of Nicholson's characters, but comes off as less of a pyschopath and more of a miserable wench, which is essentially what her character is. Fletcher captures the character to a tee and deserved the Oscar. Another actor who deserves mention is Danny DeVito. Even though he only has a small role as Martini, he imbues the character with genuine sincerity, and this is probably my second favorite performance by him (his portrayal of the Penguin in "Batman Returns" is my first).<br /><br />To put this in simple terms, this film is an absolute must have and one of the best films ever made. A masterpiece in every sense of the word.</p></body></html>

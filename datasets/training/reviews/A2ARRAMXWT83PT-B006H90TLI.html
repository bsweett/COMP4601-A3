<meta name="summary" content="Amazing! Another modern masterpiece from the Coens!"></head><body><p>This film is up for many Oscars this year. It is not hard to see why! It is another instant classic from the Coen brothers. I've seen it twice already, and I can tell you, it holds up - maybe even calls for - repeat viewings. The performances here are amazing. I do believe that this is Josh Brolin's best performance ever. Who knew that Brandt from "The Goonies" would grow up to be such a fantastic actor? Tommy Lee Jones is perfect as usual, and embodies his character to a T. The same could be said for Javier Bardem who is absolutely terrifying as a ruthless serial killer. The writing here is perfect, as expected. There are two films that I am rooting for in the Best Picture Oscar department. This is one of them. Don't miss it!</p></body></html>

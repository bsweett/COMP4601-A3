<meta name="summary" content="The most complex film you'll see"></head><body><p>Why oh why did this NOT win best Original Screenplay?  It's one of the most complex films to come out in recent memory and it loses?(I think it lost to Almost Famous, which was equally good). Anyway enough griping, this was innovative. A movie that starts you off with the last chronological event and working backwards. So imagine having Sleep, Dinner, School, Lunch, School, Breakfast in that order and you get the picture.<p>Leonard Shelby is tracking down his wife's murderer and rapist.  He fought with the assailant only to have his brain screwed with. See, he can remember everything up until the accident but everything afterwards disappears, like if he were to shower, 10 minutes later he'd literally forget he took one.  So to help him out, he takes pictures of places and pictures with notes in order to keep track of who's who and who to trust.  <p>It got quite a lot of attention due to the rather unorthodox way of showing a film(final scene first, first scene last in a time aspect), and also its twist at the end. Once it unfolds towards the end, you really see how the rest of the film came together...if you can remember it.  Problem with this kind of way of showing and also its benefit is that sometimes you forget how Leonard got to a particular place or why he was there, making the benefit of repeated viewings.<p>If you wanna work your brain for a change, instead of the &quot;jerking off the ego&quot; movies that have come out recently, give this one a watch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spider-Man 3"></head><body><p>"Spider-man 3" was fairly enjoyable, featuring a fine set of villains, and a story in line with the previous films, though I do feel the whole "black-suit" thing went on for a bit long and that the Venom scenes (which I was looking forward to the most) were a bit rushed, as was Venom's character development. The ending was a little up in the air in some ways too. A little under 4 stars, I think.</p></body></html>

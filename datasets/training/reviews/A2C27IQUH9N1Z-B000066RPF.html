<meta name="summary" content="one of the best comedies ever  and dvd extras to rave about!"></head><body><p>This is what dvds were invented for -- there are so many great features here!  So in addition to seeing one of the funniest movies ever made, you can be entertained for hours with the extras, and the extras are terrific: subtitles in English, French or Spanish; audio track choices -- English (the original mono or a brand new full stereo version), French, a directors' (Gilliam and Jones) track or a commentary track with Cleese, Idle and Palin; a copy of the script overlaid on the film; a painstaking, hilarious Henry the IV-ish subtitle for those who don't like the film; a hard-of-hearing feature; killer rabbit easter eggs; animated menus using Gilliam's original animation; karaoke renditions of 'Knights of the Round Table', 'Sir Robin' and the 'Monks Chant'; a delightful 45 minute visit to the locations with Jones and Palin; an educational film about the 'other' uses of coconuts; Japanese versions of the French Castle and Knights Who Say Ni scenes, including references to the 'holy sake cup'; a 1974 BBC Film Night visit to a location site during filming; photos of tickets, press releases, reviews, posters, production stills and original artwork; trailers; cast credits (Palin played over a dozen parts!) with pictures of each character; a Lego knights version of the Camelot scene; pictures of sketches that were never used (a killer snail?!); a web link.<p>A lot of effort went into this special edition dvd, and it shows.  I particularly enjoyed seeing Jones and Palin visit locations.  They were in a jolly mood, their comments are interspersed with film footage, and they meet affectionate and funny fans along the way.<p>If you like this film you will love this dvd version; if you love the film, you wil adore this two-dvd set.  An essential item for your collection.<p>Highest recommendation.</p></body></html>

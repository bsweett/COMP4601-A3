MY 900TH REVIEW AND COUNTING!"></head><body><p>I have not read the book, but reviewing this as a movie on it's own, it's quite good and much better than the usual action fare! Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne like a robotic killing machine. Fast paced, engrossing with an intelligent script, this film leaves you wanting more!......and more ye shall get with installments 2 and 3! The DVD has a great transfer and the extended edition is nothing more than a small scene added to the beginning and end of the film. Fortunately the theatrical release is intact.</p></body></html>

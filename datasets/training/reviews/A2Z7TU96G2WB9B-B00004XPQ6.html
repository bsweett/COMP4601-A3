<meta name="summary" content="Not bad for a formula"></head><body><p>If a major star hits box office gold, studios usually try to find a formula to guarantee themselves another hit.  That being said, this Mel Gibson film of the American Revolution feels a lot like "Braveheart."  Here, as there, the reluctant hero joins the war to fight back a brutal military and oppressive government.  Leading a band of fighters thought to be of no consequence, the hero accomplishes the improbable.<p>This movie has quite a bit of gore.  Since this does concern a war, it is to be accepted, and the movie does not romanticize the violence.  Be prepared to see wounds caused by guns and cannon.<p>Unlike some formula films, this is an engaging movie.  I don't think you would be wasting your  time watching this.  There are bits of romance and humor to keep the film from being too dark.  I would recommend watching this movie.</p></body></html>

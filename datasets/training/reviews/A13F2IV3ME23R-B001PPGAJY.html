<meta name="summary" content="WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY --- GRRREAAAT!"></head><body><p>Yah gotta love the creaters of X-Men in any form.<br /><br />I would never have picked Hugh Jackman for Wolverine [One of my top favorites from the comics] but he tends to be excellent in the part.<br /><br />It is so hard to translate comic characters into human form but they sure did it.  The X-Men come alive.<br /><br />With the lose of Jean Gray do we now look forward to The Phenoix [?]<br /><br />I hope these guys don't wait forever in bringing the X-Men stories up to date -- too many years pass inbetween and we lose the ongoing line of our characters.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- for us comic buffs - great to add to the comic collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I am a big Bill Murray-fan..."></head><body><p>...usually just a look at the guy makes me laugh. He has wonderful comic expressions! But there are limitations to the entertainment-qualities throughout this entire movie. And the ending not being much of an ending at all was a slap in the face spending 90 minutes of my life just waiting for it. The movie serves a question, no satisfying answer. To me.<br /><br />Murrays' previous "hit", that underwater-movie, was also horrible. Too easy, too simple. "Lost in translation" was beautiful. And proved a variety in Murrays' acting skills. Hoping for a more demanding part for him soon, it is easy to put a lot more into a movie that "Broken flowers" that in truth it deserves. Keep that in mind when you watch a movie that no matter what "has got to be good. Why otherwise would Murray be in it?"</p></body></html>

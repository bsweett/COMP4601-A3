Whether it is Napoleon Dynamite, Little Miss Sunshine or this years Juno.  The movie seems very simple, but it has many hidden layers.  The story simply enough is that 16 year old Juno gets pregnant and decides to keep the baby, but give her up to adoption to a yuppie couple who can't conceive.  The actors in this film are all familiar faces and do a terrific job.  Ellen Page who did a great job in Hard Candy, is fantastic with her snarky wit as Juno.  I really enjoyed the soundtrack to the film.  Though the songs are a strange bag, I found myself humming along to most of the tunes throughout the movie.  This is a fun one to watch.</p></body></html>

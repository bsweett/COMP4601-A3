<meta name="summary" content="Jennifer Aniston in an engaging little "sequel" to "The Graduate""></head><body><p>Screenwriter Ted Griffin ("Ocean's Eleven," "Matchstick Men") gets high marks for showing restraint in coming up with this "sequel," of sorts, to "The Graduate."  "Rumor Has It..." could have been played a lot broader, especially when you are talking about Shirley MacLaine playing the role of the woman who was the model for Mrs. Robinson.  This could have been a farce (remember the sequel idea that Buck Henry pitches at the start of "The Player"?), but it ends up being a romantic comedy that actually places a premium on the characters more than the comedy.<br /><br />The movie is set a decade ago so that Sarah Huttinger is old enough to basically be Jennifer Aniston's age. As we all know from the trailer, Sarah discovers that her family is the basis for the Robinsons in the book that became the movie.  Her grandmother, Katharine Richelieu (MacLaine) is the original Mrs. Robinson, which makes Sarah's mother, Jocelyn Richelieu (seen only in flashback so that the image of Katharine Ross persists), "Elaine" in the configuration.  The immediate question is who then is "Benjamin Braddock."  When Sarah goes to visit her Aunt Mimi (an uncredited Kathy Bates) to find out about the skeletons in the family closet, lights come on and suddenly the finger of fate points to Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner).<br /><br />Obviously there are some differences between "The Graduate" and the story of the Huttinger family.  Instead of "Benjamin" rescuing "Elaine" at the church from marrying "Carl," what happened was a week before Jocelyn married Earl Huttinger (Richard Jenkins), she ran off to Mexico to be with Beau.  Then she came back, got married, and eight-and-a-half months later had Sarah.  Jeff Daly (Mark Ruffalo), who is engaged to Sarah, points out the implications of the math.  Consequently, Sarah has to track down Beau and ask the big question: Are you my daddy?<br /><br />Such a scene could be played for laughs, or certainly more laughs than director Rob Reiner goes for in this 2005 film.  What I found most interesting about this film is that the best moments are not really comedic and ultimately "Rumor Has It..." is waiting to give Jennifer Aniston her moment.  The first moment comes when she confronts Beau, but it is really his scene and before he ever gets around to going for the hat trick he deals honestly with her situation (Costner is building on what he accomplished in "The Upside of Anger" as a supporting player).  The second comes when her father tells her the rest of the story that she thought she knew.  Then we come to the end of the film when Sarah finally has her moment and actually the film I was thinking about at that point was "Notting Hill."<br /><br />"Rumor Has It..." is an enjoyable film because it is a gimmick film that does not overplay its hand (nice use of the opening guitar licks from "Mrs. Robinson").  It knows that these are not the character from "The Graduate," but that some-and not all-of them are real people on whom the story was based.  The fact that Jocelyn has been dead since Sarah was nine, and that Sarah is now older than her mother was when she died, become key parts of the dynamic.  The great irony here is that Sarah proves to be her mother's daughter, but not in the way she thought and not the way in which this movie would lead you to believe.  Team Aniston is still looking for a cinematic home run and this is not it, but it is nice ground-rule double and you have to admit, she is one of the best weepers of her generation.</p></body></html>

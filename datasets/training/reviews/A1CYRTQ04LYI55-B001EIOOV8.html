<meta name="summary" content="Classic - Viva Las Vegas"></head><body><p>Classic Vegas gangster movie.  Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci almost guarantees that it'll be great - add an Oscar-worthy performance from Sharon Stone and you have one of the greatest mob flicks of all time.  Based on the true story of Sam Rothstein, a great bookie, the story covers his rise and fall in pre-corporate Vegas.  Interesting story, great acting and some classic lines - what more can you ask for?</p></body></html>

Right from the first time they ever previewed the movie on TV I could tell it was going to be a psychological drama/thriller.  Some people on here said this wasn't a horror movie. However, if you're severely claustrophobic then this would be as horrifying as it gets!  Anyway, very good movie. As others have mentioned, it is sort of like a twilight zone episode meets the butterfly effect. I love complex movies and movie that make you think. I also like a well wrote plot. The acting was good, the dream sequences were good, and the movie holds your attention from beginning to end. For that I gave it a high rating. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next (when he would go back for additional treatment). Only VERY MINOR complaints: The DVD sound could have been better (you will notice your tv volume is way louder than the DVD volume, it could have had some better production in that department). Also, by the looks of the other reviews, I think I might be the only one here who liked the butterfly effect a little better. Not to belittle this movie by any means, because this movie was great and its probably not getting enough recognition! My final VERY MINOR complaint is that I was hoping by the end of the movie that the main character would have resolved an event that happened in his past and he didn't. He actually was able to ID someone and didn't use it to his advantage. I wont get into too many details, I wont spoil it for those who haven't seen it.</p></body></html>

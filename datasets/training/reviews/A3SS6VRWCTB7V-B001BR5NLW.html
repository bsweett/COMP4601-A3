Film moves a long evenly with no gaps in action and plot? Decent enough. Dialogue, acting, ok. Of course this builds on "Pitch Black", which is also a good action film. Riddick is an interesting character and actually one I like although he is a "bad" guy to some. Recommend for action, effects.</p></body></html>

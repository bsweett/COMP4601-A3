<meta name="summary" content="Something light for the holidays"></head><body><p>SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE is just what the season needs in the theaters - a bit of fluff with enough of a message to make it worthwhile.  FINALLY we're getting movies about women who are not only beautiful but are intelligent and definite candidates for the roles of desirable leading ladies.  Diane Keaton is a joy to watch - not only because she is beautiful but also because she is such an enormously gifted actor.  Yes, the director could have put the reigns on her 'post-transformation' crying at the loss of love; that does get tiresome.  But watch the way Keaton responds as a mother to Amanda Peet, as a sister to the always superb Frances McDormand, as a gradual paramour of an aging (well cast and well performed) Jack Nicholson, and as an incredulous recipient of the honest attractions of the younger Keanu Reeves.  In each mode of her role she is not only credible, she takes us with her on a wise (and wise-cracking) journey into new territory.<p>The openness of dealing with issues of the 'over 50 crowd' in career changes, love lost and love gained, and frank sexuality is such a relief from the norm and it is to the credit of Nancy Meyers that she continues to explore this realm (see "What Women Want").  Meyers manages to tell her tales of older romantic episodes without showing prejudice to either men or women.  <p>This is a well written (at least for the first 3/4s of the film) and well directed (ditto) funny yet tender comedy that shows off the talents of the five leads very well indeed.  While the critics continue to pan the acting abilities of Keanu Reeves, here is a film that allows him subtleties and promises of depth we have not seen before.  Well worth an afternoon's relief from the holiday madness.</p></body></html>

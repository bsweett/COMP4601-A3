<meta name="summary" content="Thoroughly Enjoyable, Sometimes Biting, Homage to Fashion."></head><body><p>"The Devil Wears Prada" is based on the best-selling novel by Lauren Weisberger about a young woman's journey of self-discovery through fashion -the clothes and the industry. Andrea "Andy" Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a recent college grad with ambitions for a career in journalism. Having little luck finding a writing position in New York, Andy interviews for a job as 2nd assistant to the editor-in-chief of "Runway", a fictional premiere fashion magazine. Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the world's most powerful fashion editor, who holds her staff and her favorite designers in a state of perpetual awe and terror, decides to "hire the smart fat girl". So Andy lands the job "a million girls would kill for". It seems that the job will kill Andy until she decides to embrace her boss' values and pour herself into it, launching her to professional success and personal turmoil.<br /><br />"The Devil Wears Prada" is a bit confused when it advocates embracing one's vocation and its culture without reservation...but then says Andy should stay true to herself and walk away from it all. But that is easy to overlook, because this is such an enjoyable film. It's an homage to the fashion industry in which the city of New York is a sort of overarching character. Meryl Streep is not to be missed as Miranda Priestly, whose incisive, merciless quips inject some black comedy. The stand-out performance comes from Emily Blunt, however, as Miranda's 1st assistant, a fashionista who both envies Andy's success and depends upon it. Stanley Tucci does a nice turn as "Runway"'s acerbic but sympathetic fashion director Nigel. These people don't mince words! And that's a real pleasure.<br /><br />"Runway" magazine is modeled after "Vogue", where Lauren Weisberger worked as an assistant to editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, the inspiration for Miranda Priestly. The film's view of fashion editors is accordingly optimistic. The truth is that fashion editors are not at liberty to criticize bad designs, because the design houses pay for the ad space -even if they convince themselves otherwise by frowning on the occasional garment. But "The Devil Wears Prada" is an entertaining look at one component of the fashion industry. It respects clothes and the people who create a market for them. It conveys why fashion is important, while it encourages us to laugh at the fashion industry's excesses.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): Bonus features are 5 featurettes, 15 deleted scenes with optional commentary, a Gag Reel (5 min), theatrical trailer, soundtrack promo, and audio commentary.

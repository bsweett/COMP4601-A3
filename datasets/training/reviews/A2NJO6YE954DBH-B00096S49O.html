<meta name="summary" content="Ironically, the big truth of "Hitch" is its biggest lie"></head><body><p>The grand irony of "Hitch" is that it talks the talk but in the end does not walk the walk.  The best part of this 2005 romantic comedy happen when the title character, Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), a.k.a. the "Date Doctor," and his newest pupil, Albert Brennaman (Kevin James) are making an effort to impress the women with whom they are smitten.  Respectively, these ladies are Sara Melas (Eva Mendes), a smart but cynical gossip columnist for a New York City tabloid, and Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), a glamorous celebrity socialite.  Nobody can get past the cold exterior that Sara has built around herself and everybody, especially the rest of the NYC celebrity set wants a piece of Allegra.<br /><br />Hitch decides he is interested in Sara and his opening gambits in getting her to respond are brilliant.  The script by Kevin Bisch provides a hook (at the bar) and a line (at her office) that set up a literal sinker (on the water).  More importantly, Will Smith could not be more comfortable playing a character.  Hitch is charming and he is smart, and despite a couple of problems with this first "date," you have no trouble believing he is the "Date Doctor."  Albert is an accountant and in great need of Hitch's coaching, even to the point of needing advice whispered in his ear while having a face to face conversation with the woman he adores (try doing THAT Cyrano de Bergerac).  But when Albert first manages to get Allegra's attention, and when he manages to get her to attend a function and has to run the gauntlet of her friends, he proves himself up to the task, and the important thing is that although Hitch has set up objectives (e.g., "shock and awe"), it is Albert who comes up with the specifics.  James's performance is almost as good as Smith's, but take into consideration that his role is harder, because he has to be both the timid accountant who needs all the help in the world and the guy who has his own charming side when he has the confidence to make it work for him.<br /><br />The problem with "Hitch" is that once director Andy Tennant has shown us that the Date Doctor is effective, both for his clients as well as in his own behalf, he decides that that he has come not to praise Hitch but to bury him.  I disagree with this diagnosis.  Hitch is not a smooth operator, which is a bad thing (a.k.a. being a pig), Hitch is just flat out smooth (I never thought I would say this, but Will Smith could be the closest thing we have to a new Cary Grant).  He is not scheming to seduce Sara, he is interested in her and capable of playing the high stakes came it takes to get her to actually take a guy seriously.  Likewise, Albert is not faking.  He has a better understanding of what it is he needs to do and why, and he makes an earnest attempt to do what needs to be done.  Neither one of them is lying when they say what they say and there is certainly nothing wrong with trying to put your best foot forward.  For that matter, knowing what that means in all of its myriad forms is not a bad thing either when you are trying to impress the woman you love.<br /><br />But when Hitch has his big moment of revelation and says what the script thinks is his big line, THAT is when the character tells his first lie.  Because what he says is simply not true and the proof for it is so simple: If Hitch had never talked to Albert how far would our accounting nebbish have gotten with Allegra?  For that matter, what in all honesty could Hitch have done to impress Sara given the dazzling display that we say it took from him to get her to agree to go out in the first place?  However, before the big dramatic ending ruins "Hitch" this is a pretty good romantic comedy with lots of smart and funny scenes, so there will be a lot of people willing to enjoy it and gloss over the hypocrisy of the final act, especially with all that cool dancing during the end credits.  But I have rarely seen a film whose self-proclaimed moral so badly missed the lesson it spent one hour and forty-five minutes developing.</p></body></html>

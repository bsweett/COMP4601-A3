<meta name="summary" content="Another Brilliant Malick masterpiece..."></head><body><p>One only needs to know the small body of work that Terrence Malick has created to know his intentions. Those films are unmercifully powerful; the man's vision is absolute. He abhors violence, and has put to screen 4 magnificent films that can only make one hope that the public at large will realize that violence only begets violence. He must have a following in Hollywood; when he was casting for "The Thin Red Line", his big "comeback", everyone wanted to be in it. And a great film it is. "The New World" is rife with Malick-isms, most especially with the care of his cinematographer (Emmanuel Lubezki, it's only Oscar nomination) to show off the beauty of the world around us. Let's enjoy it in peace... Colin Ferrell is solid in the role of John Smith, and Christoher Plummer, Christian Bale, and an especially nasty David Thewliss are also very fine. The auspicious debut of Q'orianka Kilcher is subdued, haunting and quite magnificent. No matter of detail is missed, and the art direcion is to be commended. Without blabbing away the plot, I can only say that this is another big feather in Terrence Malick's cap... One can not be in a hurry when it comes to Malick. He sees everything, and he knows his material. Relax, take it in, and love it.</p></body></html>

As someone with little knowledge of this certain group of movies, or of the history and fact surrounding the characters in writer Kevin Jarre's story, I'm not about the begin to praise or denounce the film on the basis of what is truth and what is fabrication. I simply wish to comment on the wondrous sense that a long-forgotten era of movie-making seems to have been resurrected to the screen in this near-perfect spectacle of gun-slinging and rousing action. <p>Once again telling the well-known story of legendary Wyatt Earp, the films casts Kurt Russell in the main role as the now-retired sheriff reunited with his two brothers, Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton). Accompanied by their wives, the brothers journey to Tombstone, where they hope to find peace and begin their lives anew, devoid of the perils of policing town after town.<p>The film's first hour is devoted to much of the character development, and while this is usually a good thing, it tends to test one's patience with the film. We learn that Earp's new wife suffers from a drug addiction, that which keeps him from living out his married life as he wishes to. This calls for the presence of a new love interest, arriving in the form of actress Josephine Marcus (Dana Delaney); unfortunately, the movie doesn't expand much on her interaction with Earp, and their scenes together seem muddled and misplaced. <p>Of course, throughout this wallow in seemingly endless boredom, the film has two things going for its first half: the meticulous production design, and the establishment of the cast's willingness to throw themselves into their roles with full vigor. "Tombstone" vividly recreates the Old West in a manner that pays homage to the Westerns decades before, from the single street lined by houses, hotels, and saloons, to the dry, arid feel of living in these territories. <p>The introduction of its many characters provides a new entrance by another actor in an all-star ensemble cast, with Russell and Val Kilmer leading the way. Russell gives perhaps the best performance of his still-unfinished career as Earp, making the transition from a man who wants no more violence to a brother bent on exacting justice with impressive conviction. Kilmer plays the eccentric Doc Holliday with a terrific panache and humorous wit; together with Elliott and Paxton, the four form a lethal force of unrelenting justice seekers. <p>As the movie moves into its second half, things begin to pick up speed, gaining momentum with the introduction of the ruthless band of renegades known as The Cowboys, who see fit to create a ruckus throughout Tombstone that disturbs the peace Earp so desperately needs in life. pleading with his brothers to stay out of the affairs of the law, he is reluctant to take up arms against these men, though a stormy night and a dead brother provides him enough emotional anguish to create an uprising against the Cowboys and wipe them out once and for all. <p>It's material like this that director George P. Cosmatos excels at. His character development is well-guided, though throughout much of the first half, I wasn't feeling the vibes that I felt I should be. Once the first shots were fired in a spectacular shootout that begins their bloody feud, I was completely enamored by the various sequences of gunplay, which never fail to dazzle the eyes with an authentic sense of realism and historical accuracy in terms of appearance. <p>Once Earp begins to take his stand, which ends with a grandly-executed stand-off sequence at O.K. Corral, "Tombstone" proves its worth as a modern envisioning of a legendary figure. Some will quibble about its historical accuracy, while others will embrace it wholeheartedly. To be honest, I enjoyed the movie's wonderful energy and realistic depiction of the Old West, which was almost more than enough to make me overlook the shortcomings that befall its beginning.</p></body></html>

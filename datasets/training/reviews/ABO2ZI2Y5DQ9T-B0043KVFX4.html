<meta name="summary" content="(2.5 STARS) A Few Nice Actions ... But the Wait Is Long"></head><body><p>In "Resident Evil Extinction" Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in the same way as the first installment, naked but discreetly covered by plastic sheet. It looks like someone has clicked a reset button at first, but writer Paul W. S. Anderson gives us a few nice twists to the earlier part of the story. After that, however, the third "Resident Evil" film goes on the same road as the previous two "Resident Evil" films as well as past classics like "Mad Max 2."<br /><br />The actions themselves are impressive even though they are getting less and less original. Milla Jovovich does her best as film's cool heroine Alice and the Mexican location gives an authentic touch to the post-apocalypse world with the fine production designs by Oscar-winner Eugenio Caballero ("Pan's Labyrinth").<br /><br />But what does Alice have to survive? Not much. She reunites Carlos and L.J. (Oded Fehr and Mike Epps, both returning to the series), but they are not given any particular place to go, traveling from one place another looking for gas, and this is not a very exciting premise. Moreover, the people at Umbrella Company (responsible for the mass destruction of the world) are very slow to discover where Alice is. In short, we have to wait for the action to start, and the wait is long and new characters by Ashanti, Spencer Locke and Ali Larter have little to do in it.<br /><br />Here is great material out of which someone like Paul W. S. Anderson himself, who knows this genre more than anyone, might have made a better film. As it is, it is just an OK film with increasingly tired story about zombies.</p></body></html>

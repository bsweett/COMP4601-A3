<meta name="summary" content="Cult indie"></head><body><p>In less than a decade, 'Pulp Fiction' has become a cult classic, making many people's top ten films of all time.  Not only was it a highly impressive second feature but it made Quentin Tarantino a real big Hollywood player (especially after the fantastic 'Reservoir Dogs') and it didn't just ressurect John Travolta's career but it made him cool again.  There's countless moments in it to treasure, many of which have even become famous, especially Travolta and Jackson's conversation about the Royale with cheese.  Cult movie fans should also be acquainted with the debate over what really was in that suitcase: diamonds, a human soul or even a Royale with cheese!<p>The story has three basic threads - revolving around two hitmen (Travolt and Jackson), a boxer (Willis) and a couple robbing a store (Roth and Plummer).  The cast itself is formidable, with Thurman and Travolta being especially good.  Yes it's violent, and has set off various arguments over the validity of such thrillers as valid cinema.  The truth is, this grips you from start to finish, and proves beyond doubt that Quentin Tarantino is a force to be reckoned with.</p></body></html>

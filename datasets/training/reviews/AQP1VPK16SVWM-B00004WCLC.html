If you pay attention at the beginning of the movie, Anderson's point is simple; there are no accidents and things are never seemingly random events that occur due to blind, doo-dah luck. We're presented with a canvas of characters: a male nurse (Phillip Seymour Hoffman)caring for a dying TV executive (Jason Robards); The dying man's unhinged wife (Julianne Moore)who tries to hold it all together when she realizes she's fallen in love with a man she simply married for his money; the dying man's estranged son (Tom Cruise)a guru for lonely men who sells a self actualiziation program designed to help men seduce women and treat them like dirt; a child (Stanley Barry) on a winning streak on a TV game show who feels like he's a freak on display; the host of the show (Philip Baker Hall)who is estranged from his only daughter (Melora Walter); a lonely police officer (John C. Reilly) and a winning contestant from the game show (William H. Macy)who is now all grown up and on a major losing streak. All of their lives intersect in Los Angeles in this marvelously acted if slighly overwrought drama.<br /><br />Anderson's ambitious film unfolds over three hours interconnecting, twisting together all these different divergent stories into a cohesive whole. They are all damaged people trying to repair themselves in the large, impersonal city of Los Angeles. Although it's a bit overlong with too many crescendos, it's another well made ensemble piece from Anderson.<br /><br />Everybody focuses on the frogs and their meaning. They do indeed descent like sort of plague but, more importantly, they manage to unite many of these divergent characters, deal out grim justice and help those who have made a mistake undo it. It all goes back to Paul Thomas Anderson's theme that things always happen for a reason and we all have some sort of purpose even if we don't understand the consequences or how our own little lives intertwine with others.<br /><br />The stories are framed by Aimee Mann's thoughtful, melodic songs and Jon Brion's effective score. While it isn't a perfect film, it's notable for its ambitious story and the Altman-like structure of the film. In fact, "Short Cuts" and "Magnolia" have a lot in common except that Altman's film works as a sustained narrative better than Paul Thomas Anderson's film. You can put that down to experience vs. talent--both are extremely talented film directors with their own unique view of the world.<br /><br />This two disc set has extremely good image quality with robust colors and a sharp picture. While this is about 5 years old on DVD, it still looks exceptionally good (and better than other films released along the same time frame). The 5.1 sound mix sounds terrific although some of the dialogue was drowned out at the trimphumant conclusion of the film if listened to in 2.0 format vs. the 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround format.<br /><br />The extras include an exceptionally good documentary on the making of the movie which, while illuminating, isn't always enlightening.We also get an assortment of deleted scenes, TV spots and Aimee Mann's great song "Save Me" and the music video that aired at the time helping to revive her career. A complex, fascinating mediation on love, lonliness and anger and all it all both uniques and divides us all at the same time, "Magnolia" isn't for everyone but then again everyone has their own favorite flower.</p></body></html>

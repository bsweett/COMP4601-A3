<meta name="summary" content="Penguins Are Cool"></head><body><p>This really is a remarkable DVD and you learn a great deal about penguins.  However, here is my gripe.  About every 10-15 minutes they show a Penguin dying.  However, the baby penguins are pretty cute and fun to watch (except for when they are dying).  This DVD may or may not be your cup of tea.</p></body></html>

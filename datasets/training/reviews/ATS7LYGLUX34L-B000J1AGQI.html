<meta name="summary" content="An Excellent War Movie"></head><body><p>I haven't read the book that this movie is based on, so unlike reviewer Russell Ross, I have nothing to compare it to....<p> Judged on it's own, We Were Soldiers is a tremendous movie, telling the story of 400 Air Cavalry Soldiers who spent three days waging a horrific battle with over 4,000 Vietnamese Soldiers. The courage and heart that our Soldiers displayed is wonderfully portrayed, and Mel Gibson does his usual great job as their Commanding Officer. (Sam Elliott is also great as his second-in-command...) We also get to see another, seldom-seen side of the Vietnam War- The Home Front, where wives and families lived in fear of a telegram from The Army...<p> The movie's violence is VERY graphic, but war is hell, so....<p> We Were Soldiers gives us another view of America's most unpopular War, and in this time of increased patriotism, it's a welcome view at that. Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

The movie is good, but not great.  It is not as faithful to the book as Last Man on Earth, nor does Smith show the utter madness of Heston in Omega Man.  Smith was good in the role.  Better in fact than I expected him to be.  The special effects showing an abandoned New York were terrific, I don't know why the special effects for the dark walkers was so terrible.  They looked so CGI that it took away from my enjoyment of the movie.  With a big budget I don't understand how they could have done such a bad job with that aspect.  I think overall the movie could have been longer.  The idea of the last man alive is very interesting and I would have loved to see more of Smith surviving on his own.  I would have also preferred a dark ending.  The ending of this one is a little too typical Hollywood uplifting feel good end.  I did however enjoy the movie overall.  I hope that there is an extended version for the dvd release.</p></body></html>

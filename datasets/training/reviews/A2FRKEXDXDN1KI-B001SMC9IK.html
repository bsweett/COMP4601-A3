<meta name="summary" content="The good news - Plenty of special effects and action scenes.  The bad news - The overall plot"></head><body><p>"THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL" is a loosely-based remake of the popular 1951 film, one of the first films that brought the concept of science fiction and aliens to the big screen.<br /><br />Where the original film had a deep theme of the time in regards to the Cold War and the use of nuclear missiles, the theme for the 2008 remake is about the environment and the damage that people are putting on the planet.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL" DVD is presented in widescreen with a 2:35:1 aspect ratio. Most of the video is captured during the night and during grey skies.<br /><br />The film is slick and utilizes state-of-the-art special effects and for the DVD release, you get a good amount of booms and gunshots and just a multitude of sounds from the various action segments in the film ranging from piercing audio from Klaatu's guardian, helicopter and jet planes galore and just overall destruction and blasts.  There is a good amount of that and so on DVD, the audio was well-done.<br /><br />And I have no doubt in my mind that on Blu-ray and in High Definition, this film's presentation and audio would be top notch.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL" comes in two different versions on DVD.  One is a 3-Disc release (which comes with the original 1951 movie and a digital copy) and the other is a standard release.  Some retailers are offering a free 5' GORT figure with purchase of the 3-Disc version.  I am reviewing the standard release which has the following special features:<br /><br />  * Deleted Scenes - There are three deleted/extended scenes which last nearly two minutes long for all.  "Equipment is Issued to the Scientists", "Helen and Granier Discuss the Shot" and "Extended Version of Klaatu Being Wheeled Down Hallway".<br />  * Re-Imagining "The Day" Featurette - This is a 30 minute special feature about how the remake of the film came about.  The challenges for both Director Scott Derrickson ("The Exorcism of Emily Rose") and screenwriter David Scarpa had in trying to do a different film from the 1951 film since so much has changed culturally but trying to capture that same type of feel of the original.  Different but trying to keep things similar.  Featuring interviews with Keanu Reeves, Jennifer Connelly and Jaden Smith and many more.<br />  * Unleashing Gort Featurette - A near 14-minute feature featuring Director Scott Derrickson, Character Designer Aaron Simms, Producer Erwin Stoff, Visual Director Jeffrey A. Okun, Senior VFX Supervisor/WETA DIGITAL's Joe Letteri talking about  trying to create the iconic alien GORT and how he can tie in a visual sense of how he and Klaatu are tied together.  Various 3D concepts of GORT.  Originally, GORT was almost like a spider-like alien character but fortunately they changed GORT similar to its 1950's look.  GORT has undergone many designs and it was among the challenges the filmmakers had for the making of the film.<br />  * Watching The Skies: In Search Of Extraterrestrial Life Featurette - A 23-minute special feature on extraterrestrial life with interviews with Seth Shostak (Senior Astronomer for the SETI Institute) and other scientists who talk about how its possible to have living life in other planets and why the SETI does what it can to find and communicate with extraterrestrial life.  Also, explaining that plantes with certain chemical compounds can create life.  The certain technology available now for the search of other life and also a counter argument from skeptics such as Dr. Michael Shermer (publisher of "Skeptic Magazine").<br />  * The Day The Earth Was "Green" Featurette - A 14-minute featurette is about the film promoting "Green" concepts and that we are doing irreprepable harm to the planet and the planet has a "green" message.  Newscorp which owns 20th Century Fox is going carbon neutral by 2010 and thus, it was important for the film which was promoting "green" to also work with the environment in time.  How to get people of all departments for the making of the film, many of those who have worked a certain way in the industry to change their whole concept towards a "green" concept and how to make a change and how everyone was accepting it.  One of the mandates from FOX was to use 20% biodiesel fuel in the generators, an idle mandate to drivers turn off their engine, disposing waste ecologically and more.<br />  * Commentary By Writer David Scarpa - You learn a lot about the behind-the-scenes of the making of the film.  Especially the many changes the film has went through (such as the opening segment which was supposed to feature the space shuttle discovering the spheres) to reasoning why John Cleese was hired and how Jaden Smith had the support from his father (Will) who went to visit him before the emotional scene and much more.<br />  * Still Galleries - Still images from the film<br />  * Theatrical Trailer - The original 1:48 film trailer<br />  * Gort Art Contest Winners - Those who participated in the online contest, their artwork for Gort is featured.  Using your remote to cycle through each photo.<br /><br />"THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL" was a film that features a lot of special effects and a good amount of action but as for the plot, I feel that Director Scott Derrickson and screenwriter David Scarpa focused too much on being a different film than the original, not doing a remake but trying to find ways where the 2008 film would embrace a message similar to the 1951 film.<br /><br />Where the 1951 film worked was because people were really not exposed to science fiction on the big screen or an aliens coming to the planet to wipe out humans because of the nuclear arms race and the Cold War.  There is a moral message in the film.<br /><br />In 2008, the moral message is that humans are destroying the planet and if we want humanity to survive, changes would have to be made now.<br /><br />But the storyline seems to have things that were cut out and thus there are some pacing issues that unfortunately makes the flow of the film quite pale.<br /><br />We try to feel some connection with Dr. Benson (Jennifer Connelly) and her son Jacob (Jaden Smith) but instead of trying to develop these characters and their problematic relationship after the death of her husband and his father, both characters are automatically thrusted to help the alien that the relationship between stepmother and son rarely feels natural.<br /><br />Then you ask yourself, so a sphere touches down on Central Park but why have the scientists there in the front line?  In fact, why bother introducing the scientists in the beginning when they play no significant role in the film.  In fact, why is Dr. Benson even there.  Is she that great of a scientist that she needed to be called?  And why is she the kind of scientist that is given quite a bit of leeway?  In other words, why is she important?<br /><br />As for Klaatu (Keanu Reeves), he manages to escape but during this time of national chaos, knowing the streets are jammed, Dr. Benson somehow gets home quickly and for him, he's observing humanity through a train station and he collapses.  And then all of a sudden, he manages to make a phone call to Dr. Benson for her to pick him up and immediately, she's there to pick him up despite the terrible traffic.<br /><br />As for the American military just so gung-ho to attack, may it be Godzilla or King Kong, there is always provocation to an attack, but Gort only acts on self defense.  So, you see a message of pre-Iraq, "let's go to war" mentality but with a "kill now, answers later" military campaign.  I would hope that if the Earth is about to be obliterated, determination of extinction is not based on a train station melee and a problematic relationship between a step mother and her son.<br /><br />In a way, I was hoping for something along the lines of "Independence Day" but in the end, we get something like "Godzilla".  A film with a lot of action and special effects but no substance behind the overall plot.<br /><br />If anything, It's April and that means "Earth Day" is coming and with the release of plenty of environment or "Green" based DVD's, "THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL" definitely has that message of keeping the Earth safe and changing your ways before its too late, and fortunately, that message does come clear.  Also, another positive is GORT, I actually dig the mighty defender of Klaatu.<br /><br />Despite my feelings about the overall storyline, "THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL" is an entertaining film and the constant amount of action and special effects is definitely worth checking out, otherwise the film is a mere rental not a keeper.</p></body></html>

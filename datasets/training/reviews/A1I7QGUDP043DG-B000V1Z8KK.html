<meta name="summary" content="Shooter review"></head><body><p>A veteran double crossed by the government during his early military career is used once again in this fast paced action flick.  The unsuspecting soldier is talked into helping 'prevent' the assassination of a president, but things are not what they seem and he's roped into a deep conspiracy. Now he must run for his life while he tries to find a way to reveal the truth. I could slightly guess the formula and where it was leading on this one, but still enjoyed the action packed story.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""One Of The Best Films Of All-Time""></head><body><p>Quentin Tarantino became a household name after the release of "Pulp Fiction" in 1994. He directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Roger Avary depicting the underbelly crime scene of the greater Los Angeles area. John Travolta's career took an upward turn after a series of Hollywood flops in this masterpiece playing a hit man who works alongside another psychotic maniac, played superbly with unapologetic force by Samuel L. Jackman. The story mainly deals with their encounters with many shaddy creatures in the drug trade as the film's backdrop. Uma Thurman plays the wife of a mob boss who "loves to powder her nose" frequently. Uma's portrayal in "Pulp Fiction" is downright disturbing as well as being hilarious which adds to the different elements of her character. Bruce Willis and Harvey Keitell have supporting roles.<br /> "Pulp Fiction" would receive a whopping seven Academy Award nominations including one for Best Picture. Quentin and Roger Avary would win one of the most acclaimned Oscars, for Best Original Screenplay.<br /> On a paltry budget of $8,000,000, "Pulp Fiction" has so far grossed an incredible $212,000,000 at the worldwide boxoffice becoming one of the biggest films ever.<br /> The DVD is filled with bonuses, including documentaries, Quentin's appearance on PBS' "The Charlie Rose Show", featurettes, TV Spots, still galleries, deleted scenes, and more.</p></body></html>

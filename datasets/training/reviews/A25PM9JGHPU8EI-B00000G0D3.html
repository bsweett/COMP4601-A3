<meta name="summary" content="Classic, long-dead wide format"></head><body><p>This is one of the few films shot in MGM Camera 65 (later known as Ultra Panavision). Now generally I dislike anything to do with the Bible or religious nonsense, but there are some make-believe / fantasy films which define this genre that are entertaining to watch (the Ten Commandments, for example). The spectacular images inside the 2.76:1 widescreen aspect are amazing to take in; you will want to view this film on a screen 36" or larger, otherwise you'll be sitting REALLY close to the set. It's a shame films today aren't composed inside extremely wide frames like this one. I suppose its near-equivalent now would be anything in IMAX, but that format will likely never be used as a primary method for anything but specialty features. The commentary included does NOT run throughout the film. Heston is heard only during select scenes. Warner Bros. screwed that up. They could have easily hired a notable film historian for added value, but no.<br /><br />Note: a four disc deluxe edition is forthcoming with gobs more features.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Danny Trujo for Presidente!"></head><body><p>I wanted badly to enjoy this film, because the tailer is so great and because Danny Trujo has deserved a starring role in a film for such a very long, long time... but the plot was just too hammy. Best scene was when Machete was making out in the pool with the topless wife and daughter of his adversary. Too many meatheads in this film, in particular the racist homicidal maniac senator (typical, typical) played by Robert "who believes he will ever be in a good movie again" DeNiro. Danny Trujo is good in the film, although they give him too little dialogue - the "strong silent type" thing doesn't work forever. Jessica Alba nearly ruins the movie with her stupid participation, and Michelle Rodriguez doesn't really spice it up much except as eye candy.  Looking forward to Machete Kills and Machete Kills again - I just KNOW that they can do better.</p></body></html>

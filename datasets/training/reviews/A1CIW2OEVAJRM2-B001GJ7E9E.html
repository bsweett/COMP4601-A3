<meta name="summary" content="It's no laughing matter when a married couple are out to murder each other"></head><body><p>Marriage is a beautiful and rich gift - when it works.  In the real world, because of fallen human nature, it's sometimes more about killing each other.  Usually it's just looks that kill and words that bite, but in this romantic action comedy film, the two main characters are real-life assassins who turn against each other in a very real bid to take each other out.<br /><br />Mr and Mrs John and Jane Smith (played by real life husband and wife Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) begin the film like many a married couple - on a couch, discussing their marital woes and observing how there seems to be so much distance between them.  The distance turns out to be far more than both of them could ever have imagined.  For over five years of marriage, they have both kept much of their real lives hidden from each other, including the fact that they are skilled assassins working for different companies.  It's while on assignment that they discover their true identities, but now they are commissioned to eliminate each other.  The first part of the film sets up this conflict, then moves into some stirring action sequences, with the highlight being a frenzied and violent battle between both protagonists in their home, until the very last moment when love triumphs over hate, and they lay down their guns and team up.  Then just when you thought the film was over, it switches gears, and the last part of the story sees them working together as a team against both their firms, who pull out all stops to terminate both of them.  The PG-13 rating is accounted for mostly by all the gunfire, bloodshed, explosions and the high body count needed to make this happen, as well as considerable sexual innuendo.<br /><br />For me the film just didn't work.  Marriage is intended to be a beautiful thing, and to see a married couple's strife escalate to the point where they are trying to kill each other was just painful to watch, even worse than watching  a train wreck.  Seeing the intense violence of a husband and wife kicking and punching and shooting each other in an all out effort to murder the other is not my idea of fun.  This wasn't helped by the fact that the film trivialized the conflict by taking on a comic tone, which minimized the very real  difficulties that some couples can experience in their relationships - and when it happens, it's no laughing matter.  The fact that the film was a comedy also didn't rescue the fact that the story-line was so unbelievable, particularly the critical and totally ridiculous point where the Smiths move from turning against each other to working together.  In real life, pulling out all stops to kill each other doesn't bring back the spark of love or inflame passion.  And it becomes just a bit too much to ask viewers to suspend their disbelief even further in the action sequences which follow, where our heroes take out a gazillion highly trained soldiers, while barely breaking into a sweat or getting a scratch.<br /><br />Rather than succeeding as a comedy, for me this film was a real tragedy, and epitomizes how Hollywood sometimes gives superficial treatment to very serious issues in the real world.  Even the `happy' ending doesn't make up for this.  Regrettably, for me the comic story of Mr & Mrs Smith just left me feeling disappointed.  There are many very real Mr & Mrs Smiths out there who experience the tragedy of this film in their marriages, and sadly it's no laughing matter. - GODLY GADFLY</p></body></html>

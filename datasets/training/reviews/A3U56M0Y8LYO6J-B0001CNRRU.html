To watch lives change in an instant is a sobering experience.  Almost as sobering as the claim that life itself may only weigh 21 grams. <p>Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is a college professor with a heart problem.  Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) is a former convict who has turned his life around with the help of his strong religious beliefs.  Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) is a married woman who finds comfort and stability in her husband and two daughters.  A tragedy strikes that devastates Cristina and sets into motion a series of events that draws Paul into her life and forces Jack to reassess his most deeply-held beliefs.  <p>Inarritu's decision to intercut the stories of the three characters in a non-chronological manner is jarring at the outset.  However, if you stick with the film, you will be rewarded when all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place and the tale can be finally seen in its entirety.  Penn and Watts are solid in their roles but Del Toro's performance is absolutely mesmerizing.  You can literally feel the pain of Jack as he abandons everything he has come to believe and cherish in life.  Eddie Marsan, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Melissa Leo perfectly compliment the leads with their supporting performances and prove invaluable in increasing the emotional impact of the unfolding events.  If you're willing to accept the unique storytelling style of "21 Grams" then you will find yourself watching a devastating and absorbing creative work.</p></body></html>

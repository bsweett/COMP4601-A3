<meta name="summary" content="Mesmerized"></head><body><p>I went to the movie theatre expecting a good film and became mesmerized.  I went back again with my daughter for a second time and now have the DVD.  My jaw drops with HOW good this movie is.  Director Mike Binder who was in "Minority Report" as an actor and who wrote the screenplay does an amazing job with the dialogue.  It's framed by some very literate narration from the young daughter Popeye played by Evan Rachel Wood from TV's "Once & Again" series.<br /><br />Joan Allen's performance is brilliant.  She is so angry and depressed and achieves such comedy that it's amazing she didn't walk away with a gold statuette at the Oscars.  She is so self-absorbed and delights in it so that everyone around her must pay attention.  When she goes to meet daughter Hadley's new in-laws she downs Bloody Marys like they were Pepsi-Colas and says, "Well, at least you're not Jewish."  It's the quintessential inappropriate remark and later causes her to describe herself as the poster child for alcohol prevention.  The costumer who puts her in the flowing nightgowns in the bedroom as she rips her husband's clothes out of the closet and his pictures off the wall is brilliant.  While most of the film's expressionistic flourishes fell on the cutting room floor in the deleted scenes, the one brilliant moment is when Shep slurps soup and his head suddenly explodes.  The deleted scenes show a fantasy sequence where Joan Allen's Terry has murdered her husband and his cheating partner and the bloody husband's corpse comes back to complain.  Terry looks at him with one of those icy stares and then punches his bloody hacked head.  It is hysterical!<br /><br />Her comedy plays off of a brilliant Kevin Costner performance as a former baseball star who seeks a life after baseball.  His giddy little expressions as he intrudes on her shower and offers her a drink are priceless.  After he makes love, he lays back and looks like the happiest man on the planet.<br /><br />The supporting actors are excellent.  In addition to Wood as Popeye, TV's Felicity, Keri Russell, plays Emily who longs to dance, but who the mother shuts down as being unrealistic.  Her illness and Terry's rushing to her side show even more levels of caring, tenderness, and gives the mother character a perspective on her own difficulties.  Erika Christensen from "Swimfan" and "Flight Plan" does an excellent job as Andy who doesn't want to go to college and gets a job as a production assistant at the radio station.  Her affair with middle-aged Shep is hilarious, especially when Terry discovers them in bed and is so furious words will not even form on her lips over the intense rage she feels.  Alicia Witt who was in "Vanilla Sky" plays the older daughter Hadley who marries and has several babies in the course of the film.  Dane Christensen plays Popeye's friend Gordon who she hits on, only to find out he's gay.  His bungi-jumping scene through their plate glass window is hysterical for the nonverbal reactions from Joan Allen.<br /><br />I also found the theme of the movie to be profound.  Anger is an emotion that many experience.  Controlling it, channeling it and focusing in ways that don't hurt those around us is an important lesson that some never learn.  As an actress, Joan Allen expresses her rage so exquisitely that we both laugh & cry.  This will be a film I will pull out from time to time as one of my all-time favorites.  Bravo!</p></body></html>

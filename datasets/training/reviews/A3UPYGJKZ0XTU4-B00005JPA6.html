In 1944, young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) travels with her mother (Adriadna Gil) from a war-torn city to the mountains to meet her new stepfather. Ofelia is an imaginative girl often engrossed in her fairy tale books. Her mother is expecting a child, and her new husband, the fastidious fascist Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), has insisted that she join him. Ofelia and Vidal take an immediate dislike to one another, but the country fires Ofelia's imagination. She is led to an ancient portal guarded by a faun named Pan (Doug Jones). Pan assumes Ofelia is the Princess Moanna, who left the underworld long ago to live among humans, but who is prophesied to return. Ofelia must complete 3 tasks in order to be readmitted to her kingdom. Meanwhile, Captain Vidal ruthlessly and indiscriminately battles Republican rebels, who find sympathy among the locals.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" alludes to various other works of fantasy, and its symbolism isn't slight. But Ofelia is engaging and her fantasies so vivid that the film never seems to be going over old territory. This may be due to the story's immersion in the real, intensely violent and unjust world of civil conflict in Spain. A child's fantasies take on greater meaning in contrast to and as commentary on the turbulent and dangerous world around her. The fantasy world is not safe or forthright but presents the kind of choices that the adults around her make. Perhaps it's unusual to make a fantasy film exclusively for older viewers, but the real-world violence in "Pan's Labyrinth" is too graphic and sadistic for young children and may unsettle some adults. Nevertheless, this is a beautiful film that engrosses the viewer in the fight to determine Spain's future and a child's conception of a fantastic world in which she too battles for what she holds dear -enabled in no small part by Guillermo Navarro continually gliding camera. In Spanish with English subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (New Line 2007 single disc): There is an unnecessary "Director's Prologue" (24 sec) in which the director introduces the film. Under "Marketing Campaign", there is Poster Art (7), a teaser trailer (1 min), a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min), and 7 short TV spots (4 min). There is a good audio commentary in English by director Guillermo del Toro. He discusses this film as a companion piece to "The Devil's Backbone" (2001), the themes of choice and disobedience, magic and violence, the role of violence in the film, symbolism, staging the real vs fantasy worlds, sources for some of the material, camera work, color palette, and blending reality and fantasy. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.</p></body></html>

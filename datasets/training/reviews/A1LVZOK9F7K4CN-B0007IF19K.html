I suppose that this is probably they could've made from the life of Ray Charles.  It's not that Ray Charles isn't interesting enough - it's that he's too interesting.  How do you squeeze a fifty-plus year career into a two-and-a-half-hour movie?  (The movie FEELS very long.)  So, the movie focuses on the broad arc of Ray's life.  The themes in the movie are Ray's constant infidelities, his addiction to heroine, and the question - how can a blind man every really trust anybody?  I won't go any further into Jamie Foxx's performance - he should win the Oscar.  It's only a shame that Ray Charles didn't live long enough to ride the high of his newly-restored popularity.</p></body></html>

It is no wonder Universal and MGM shelved the film after its completion for fear of the devastating effect it would have on their reputations. Shot like some sort of acid-induced Heavy Metal video, HOUSE borders on genius and sheer madness, but the disjointed narrative structure and crude editing show signs of Zombie's inexperience. Two couples run into trouble on Halloween Eve when they set out to find the burial site of local legend Dr. Satan. After going flat on an old country road, a beautiful hitchhiker lures the tourists to her family's decrepit home, where they are beaten and tortured before they come face to face with Dr. Satan! The entire picture plays out like a fan boy's wet dream, making frequent pop-culture references while filling out the cast with B-movie icons like Bill Moseley, Sid Haig, and Karen Black in a series of bizarre and frightening new roles. HOUSE most successfully emulates the filthy look and feel of 70's Exploitation pictures like TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE or THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, leaving the viewer in a disgusted state of shock after each of the grueling torture sequences. With HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES, Rob Zombie ushers in an unbridled new style of excessive Horror filmmaking that is wildly entertaining, but severely lacking in its basic storytelling techniques.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></body></html>

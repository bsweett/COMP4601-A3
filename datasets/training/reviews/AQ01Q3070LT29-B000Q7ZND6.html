<meta name="summary" content="Keanu Reeves has a devil of a time."></head><body><p>If you liked Keanu Reeves in The Devil's Advocate (1997), you'll like him in this devilish story.<br /><br />  A Hispanic, Manuel (Jesse Ramirez) is under the ruins of a freeway.  Under some wooden planks in the ground he finds an accient dagger wrapped in a Nazi flag.  With he dagger, he begins to walk away and suddenly is hit by a car that came out of nowhere.  He appears to be dead, but 27 seconds later, still holding the dagger he becomes alive and runs off.  The car is totalled, but Manuel is perfect.<br /><br />  An Asian mother (Suzanne Wang) find her daughter (Jhoanna Trias) possessed.  John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is called upon to help the girl. He is a modern-day exorcist.  First he finds the right religious symbol to shadow upon the girl for irritation.  Then he gets himself close to the demon's face and calls it a profanity. When the demon's face tries to come out of the girl's throat, Constantine gives it a right hook.<br /><br />  John Constantine is really tired of fighting the demons all the time and he just found out he has lung cancer from smoking since he was 15.  Be as it may other people are still in need of his help, including Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) who had a twin sister that fell from the hospital roof, but she believes it was murder.<br /><br />  Stay tuned after the end credits.  There is one more scene.<br /><br />  DVD includes in Special Features many deleted scenes and audio commentary.</p></body></html>

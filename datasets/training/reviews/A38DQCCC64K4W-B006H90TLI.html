<meta name="summary" content="A Perfect Crime Drama"></head><body><p>I know that many of today's movie goers get bored if there isn't some huge action scene every 10 minutes; The latest Coen venture is all about tension, followed by sudden and unexpected bursts of violence. It's all about a situation you know isn't good for anyone, the people involved, and the places it takes them. No, there aren't any huge explosions or 20 minute shoot-outs. But you have an ensemble cast that sucks you in, a flawless screenplay adaptation(inc. some of the best dialog in recent memory....), and some beautiful desert settings.  It's brutal and relentless, yet it's a film that has you thinking days after it's over.  And while many had a problem with the ending, I don't think it could have ended any other way.  I have read a lot of reviews that called this movie 'boring'. Personally, I can't understand that. I was never bored, and when it was over I watched it again.  Fans of true-to-life crime will find this to be an incredible film. There's a reason it won best picture. And Javier Bardem is the best criminal psycho since Samuel Jackson in 'Pulp Fiction'. This movie is the real deal, made by people who know what they're doing and have a love for making movies that matter.</p></body></html>

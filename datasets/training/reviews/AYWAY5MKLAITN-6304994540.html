<meta name="summary" content=""I said I just checked in to see what condition my condition was in!""></head><body><p>In this story,<br /><br />There are two people both named Lebowski.<br /><br />You have your rich tycoon who is handicapped to a wheel chair and who has a young starlet wife. This is one lebowski.<br /><br />The other is a totally different man who's tsraight out of the post-sixties era who just happens to be a regular bowler and is a private investigator as well. This is Jeffery "The Dude" Lebowski. But the tables turn when a group of kidnappers want money from lebowski and show up at the dude's house, infiltraiting his life with a host of colorful characters and a big comedy that's unpredictable in it's delivery.<br /><br />I loved every minute of this movie. Everything. From the dude's attitude to the classic lines "Hey, man! CaREFUL! There's a beverage here!" when he's being dragged away from his home right down to the "I really loved that carpet, man! It really tied the room together!"<br /><br />Now, Jeffery lebowski must participate in a chance to get the kidnapped girl, get his carpet, or at least a new one, back, and to figure out the soulfully pleasent mysteries of life by bowling with his buddies and trippin' out on some delusional dreams that include musical numbers.<br /><br />Get this movie now!<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better Than Most Horror Sequels I Have Seen..."></head><body><p>Most fans of Saw one will admit that the sequel wasn't as good as the first but most horror fans will also admit that it is one of the better sequels to come out for a horror film than most we have seen.<br /><br />Saw 2 finds actually a very clever way to connect both part one and two together by bringing back a woman from part one who survived. She is supposed to be there to help the rest who are new to the twisted game of Jigsaw's. There is ending scene as well in the movie that connects one and two in another way that I won't spoil but will answer all your questions you had for the two unfortunates in the first film.<br /><br />So yes the writing is in ways strong and keep you there in front of the screen. It does keep you caring about what will happen and you pray the main character's son that is one of the new players of Jigsaw's game survives. Also what makes this movie worth watching is the fact that you finally get to know the mysterious Jigsaw a lot better than you ever did know and he becomes less ominous- feeling than he was in the first and just...a sick (both mentally and physically) person that hasn't been caught yet.<br /><br />The characters are strong-ish. There are just too many characters I feel in this movie, so there isn't enough time for any of them to be too strong. The only ones that truly stood out was the boy, mainly because the main character is his father and trying to save him, and the survivor of the first movie who knows a little too much- I felt. Then of course Jigsaw. The film was sort of messy though because there shouldn't have been that many characters.<br /><br />Part one I felt was stronger in this case because there were less characters so thus they had a chance to grow into stronger personalities as the movie rolled on. And also Jigsaw having an ominous feel just made part one a lot more creepy than the second. The writing in the first was also more stronger just cause again less characters. But in both endings, I was surprised. I have to admit that. Both endings I didn't even think about till they were played.<br /><br />So overall this was a good follow- up to the Saw part one, but it doesn't match up to the strength of part one either. I highly recommend part one and also this one just because in part two they add a little more to the story everyone who liked Saw 1 should know.</p></body></html>

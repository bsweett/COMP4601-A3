Director Frank Darabont leaves no stone unturned in resorting to tired cliches in this fable about this hulking Black man (Duncan) who is on death row for murdering two white girls and befriends a prison guard (Hanks).  Through their friendship, it is revealed that Coffey has these healing powers, which, oddly, he uses to save everyone but himself.  And yadda, yadda, yadda.  The streotypes that emerge in this film are appalling.  The performances were okay, but was this really Oscar material?  The best thing about this movie is that, at three hours, it's paced fairly well.  It goes by so quickly, that you'll hardly realize that you wasted three hours on this preachy, self-important excuse of a film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Much better than &quot;Manhunter&quot;!"></head><body><p>Much more watchable than &quot;Manhunter&quot;.  This film has style, is well-acted, and doesn't feel so &quot;1980's&quot;, unlike &quot;Manhunter&quot;.  Plus, it features Sir Anthony doing his thing as Hannibal.<p>Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="EXCELLENT MOVIE!  KEEP'EM COMING!"></head><body><p>An outstanding animated film, Shrek 3 or Shrek the Third, brings to the screen the ongoing story of Shrek and Fiona, only this time they find themselves facing an old foe in her parents' home kingdom of Far Far Away with all the ups and downs that that entails!<br />Picking up from where Shrek 2 left off, Shrek 3 continues to shed light on the lovable duo and the rest of the original, and truly adorable, entourage.<br />Apart from all the fun and humor (and there is so much of it!), it is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.<br />Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the HUMOR (!!!) and the music (!) are all wonderful!<br />In short, Shrek the Third is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!<br />Strongly recommended along with the previous two Shrek movies, the Ice Age movies, Antz, The Ant Bully, Cars, Flushed Away, Hoodwinked, Madagascar, Monsters Inc. and Over the Hedge.</p></body></html>

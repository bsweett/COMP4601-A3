<meta name="summary" content="Non stop action + Big explosions + Outrageously illogical = worth renting"></head><body><p>This movie has non-stop action and big explosions. Yet it's so outrageously illogical that it's funny in many scenes. For example the scene on the brigde where Bruce did a lot of dangerous jumping and fighting. However, he got no serious injuries! No broken bones! There's no suspense at all.<br /><br />I found the first installment is more suspenseful.<br /><br />It's still worth renting.</p></body></html>

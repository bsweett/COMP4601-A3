<meta name="summary" content="SIMON PEGG IS THE NEW COP IN TOWN"></head><body><p>This is a great comedy. It has that fun quirky indie feel to it with none of the low budget drippy music let down. Simon Pegg plays Nicholas Angel. Angel is London's greatest policeman. In fact he is too good and makes the rest of the force look bad. They promote him and railroad him out to Sanford, a village which constantly wins "Village of the Year" awards. They have a low crime rate, primarily because the police don't arrest anyone, a British version of Mayberry. This puts Angel at odds with everyone in town, whom remain polite as he seemingly busts everyone in the peaceful village. The comedy is greater good. While on duty and sitting in a pub with fellow policemen, they talk about firearms.<br /><br />Andie: "Everyone in town and their mum owns a gun."<br />Angel: "Such as who?"<br />Andie: "Farmers own guns."<br />Angel: "And who else?"<br />Andie: "And their mums."<br /><br />Nick Frost plays PC Danny Butterman who becomes Angel's sidekick. He loves police movies and admires Angel. Together they become a crime fighting duo in a village that has a secret.<br /><br />F-bomb, no sex, fake nudity. some blood and gore.</p></body></html>

Plus with Tales Season 2, you get 17 other spooktacular episodes to keep you entertained if you're 'dying' for more than 30 minutes of scares.<br /><br />I remember reading 1408 in Stephen King's collection of short stories <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743457358">Everything's Eventual : 14 Dark Tales</a> back in 2002. 1408 wasn't one of the most impressionable King stories from that collection, and the 2007 movie adaptation with John Cusack held suit...not impressionable. Not a bad movie, but certainly not a Horror film that will be remembered as great.<br /><br />There are some good scares (that reminded me of that Tales From the Crypt episode that I mentioned earlier) in 1408. 1408 held my attention well enough, and John Cusack does a stand-up job at what is practically a solo performance all the way through (with brief {but always excellent} appearances by Samuel L. Jackson). But all in all, 1408 seemed like one of those Horror movies that I'd seen before...and I don't mean because I'd read the short story years ago...I mean because it just wasn't that original.<br /><br />So unless you've got nothing else in your viewing queue, 1408 might be best viewed as a hey-look-what's-just-about-to-start-on-cable flick.</p></body></html>

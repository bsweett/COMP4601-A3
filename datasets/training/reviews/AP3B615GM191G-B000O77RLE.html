<meta name="summary" content="Never Really Surprised Me"></head><body><p>After thoroughly enjoying Clint Eastwood's "Flags of Our Fathers", I was inspired to check out his Japanese-perspective companion piece "Letters From Iwo Jima".  Although the film was not bad by any means, it failed (were so many other Eastwood films have succeeded) to really surprise me or get me thinking about deeper issues.<br /><br />Basically, the film centers on the Iwo Jima invasion in the Pacific Theater of World War II, only from the Japanese army perspective.  The technical aspects of the battle, such as defending Mt. Suribachi, are discussed, but the movie really is about showing the differences between what the U.S. and Japan viewed as being honorable in battle.  Whereas the U.S. would give it's all and then retreat (to save lives) if the battle was not deemed winnable, Japanese soldiers were expected to die at their post (a sort of throw-back to the old samurai Bushido culture), even if that meant committing suicide so as not to be taken prisoner.<br /><br />While it was interesting to become more educated on these differences, I found there to be too few "wow" moments during the film.  I came in with the expectation of seeing the Iwo Jima battle from the Japanese perspective, and that is exactly what I got...no more, no less.  It's not like Eastwood's other recent films (Million Dollar Baby, Gran Torino, etc.), where they build on complex themes and touch on heavy societal issues.  This one is more cut-and-dry.<br /><br />One positive area I would like to single out, however, is the musical score.  The plinking piano and soulful strings of Kyle Eastwood did more to tug at my heart-strings than any of the character performances.  Eastwood (both Sr. and Jr.) has developed quite a positive reputation for the music of his films, and in no way does this one disappoint.<br /><br />Thus, if able, I would have given this film a "3.5 star" rating.  It's better than "just okay" due to the interesting perspective and touching music, but not quite "really good" because of the lack of emotional depth.  Also, the sooner you watch it after "Flags of our Fathers", the better, as the subject matter will be fresh in your brain.</p></body></html>

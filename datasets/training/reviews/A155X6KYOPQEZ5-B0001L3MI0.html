<meta name="summary" content="Amazing sci-fi action movie!"></head><body><p>Aliens coming to destroy earth. That's basically Independence Day in a nutshell. But there's A LOT more to it than that. Not only does Will Smith star in this one, but the special effects in it are just unbelievable! This is definately one of the top sci-fi movies I love watching again and again. The aliens bombing Washington D.C looks just unbelievably real!!! If you don't believe me, watch the movie for yourself. Not only does the alien spaceship look real, but the aliens themselves look great, too! For all you alien, Will Smith, or sci-fi fans out there, this is a must for you!!!</p></body></html>

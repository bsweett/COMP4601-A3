<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Yet Not Enough Action."></head><body><p>Equilibrium - an interesting concept. Yes this film may look and perhaps imitate other Sci-Fi movies but its basic storyline is original and thought provoking. <p>Christian Bale is John Preston, a Cleric who enforces the law of no emotion after they were declared illegal in order to prevent further war - achieved by the newly created drug 'Prozium'. One morning, having failed to take his daily dose of it, Preston realises the highs and lows of his new found human emotions and embarks on a new alliance with 'The Underground' and a fight to free the rest of the impassive city of Libria.<p>Some interesting ideas here, yet Writer/Director Kurt Wimmer did not execute them well enough nor expand on their philosophy. Not only that, its intent to be an action film was not fulfilled considering the Cleric's powers revolve around the fictional fighting style 'Gun Kata', it is seldom used. Had there been a few added fight scenes near the beginning and a bigger climatic fight at the end, Equilibrium would have been a lot more entertaining.<p>That aside and considering the rather low funding it had, Equilibrium exceeds as a low budget action film. Definitely worth watching.</p></body></html>

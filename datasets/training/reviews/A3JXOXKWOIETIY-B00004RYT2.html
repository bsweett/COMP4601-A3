<meta name="summary" content="One small step for Ron, one overrated film for mankind"></head><body><p>Apollo 13 has been so overpraised as a film even the evil Newt Gingrich would like it's hard to buck the trend, but here goes:  As  one of the Apollo moon mission junkies I saw this one on its release and was disappointed. Instead of the profound experience I expected of man going to the moon I got some jokes about the constellation Urine, some lines like, "Mommy, you're squishing me", and family scenes so schmaltzy they are practically unwatchable.<br /><br />  The film should be considered well done except for these family scenes which dumb it down so much.<br /><br />  To me the Apollo missions are mankind's greatest achievement and this film cheapens the experience.  I hope man one day returns to the moon and onto Mars instead of spending trillions of dollars on war.  I recommend an excellent, but hard to get documentary on Apollo 11 called, "Moonwalk One" that's shown sometimes on NASA TV.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="All 3 on dvd!!!, I dont believe it!!!!!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>Finally all 3 back to the futures on one amazing collection. All three movies are great. They are one of the best movies of the 80's. And even of all time. Back to the Future Part 1 is about a boy named &quot;Mardy&quot; who travels back in time to 1955. He runs into his mother, which screws his mother and father relation ships. He needs help from his scientist friend named &quot;Dock&quot;. If you have the collection without the V2 on the back. The first film is not out of the frame. Only on the 2nd and 3rd movie. 8 deleted scences, behind the scense, outtakes and much more!<p>Back to the Future part 2 takes place where Back to the Future left off. Mardy and his girlfriend Jennifer need to visit the future to help their children. Then Biff (Mardys Bully) old self, becuase you see when Mardy and Dock went to the future, Mardy picked up a magizine about 50 years of sports of who wins, which Mardy can then make a few extra bucks. Dock throws away the magazine then old Biff gets the magizine and travels back to give it to his young self. Which Biff then becomes a billionare. There are 7 deleted scences with optional commentary. Behind the scenes and outtakes and much more. <p>The third and final installment of the saga takes place in the old west. You see Dock travels back in time to be left alone, but then Mardy discovers his grave, and then travels back into time to save Dock. Dock then saves a scientist who was suppose to<br />die jumping off a cliff. It is a great and final ending for the saga. It includes only 2 deleted scences, outtakes, behind the scenes and more. Make sure when you buy this dvd it has a V2 on the back. If it doesnt you can call the company and they'll ship you new dvds. If you dont know what I'm talking is about is because they mest up on the framing on Back to the Future part 2 and 3. A must to buy if your a huge fan of the movies!!!</p></body></html>

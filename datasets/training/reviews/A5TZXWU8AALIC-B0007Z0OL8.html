I had to see how a politically-correct crowd of west coasters would react to the onslaught of crude humor in TEAM AMERICA.  There were gasps, but there were a lot of laughs (I saw it in Santa Monica).  The house wasn't full, but I realized that this movie will probably do better when it hits DVD and the stigma of being seen going to it won't be as bad.<br /><br />Kind of like porn.<br /><br />Like some of their best stuff, the creators of TEAM AMERICA are very hit and miss.  But when they hit, it's into the stratosphere.<br /><br />Rarely have I seen a movie that manages to make fun of so many things to so many people.  There's bound to be at least one thing that will offend anyone reading this, but you'll probably have a couple really hard laughs at other scenes.<br /><br />They've taken the ridiculous medium of puppetry (remember the THUNDERBIRDS from childhood?) to play out a brainless Hollywood action film, but they've also satirized the brainless Hollywood A-list of celebrity/activists (including "the greatest living actor of all-time, Alec Baldwin").  The constant barrage of bad language detracted from the overall film--but these are the mind behind "South Park," so there you go.<br /><br />I have a feeling the film will be more successful as a DVD: everyone's curious to see what was left out the first time around--especially of that notorious puppet sex scene!</p></body></html>

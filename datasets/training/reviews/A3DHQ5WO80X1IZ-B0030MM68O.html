<meta name="summary" content="Best movie of 2009 so far"></head><body><p>One of the year's best films, this follows a team of GIs in Iraq whose job is to defuse and/or detonate potential bombs. Incredibly taut and scary, particularly when you think about the fact that there are hundreds of soldiers still doing this same job right now.<br /><br />As a side note - I was on a whale watch this week and started talking with the volunteer naturalist, Jason. He had just come back from two tours in Iraq, doing this exact job. He said that of 198 men in his outfit, 196 had been wounded. (Including himself - 90% deaf in one ear from an IED blast.) He also said that the outfit was now being re-deployed to Afghanistan. I asked him if he has seen 'The Hurt Locker' yet, and he hadn't; but a lot of his comrades had, and they all raved about it. That alone should be enough of an endorsement - see this movie!!!</p></body></html>

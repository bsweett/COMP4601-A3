<meta name="summary" content="Comic fright film classic"></head><body><p>YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is a superb comedy, a masterpiece of motion picture parody and the very best work of all involved.<br /><br />Co-scripted by Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks and directed by the latter, YF lampoons the original 1931 Frankenstein movie as well as several other fright film classics. The laughs come fast and furious, as the finished movie was whittled down from over 3 hours to its current running time of 106 minutes. In the process, a lot of weak jokes were discarded, leaving only the funniest audience-tested material intact.<br /><br />YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is also available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305168857">DVD</a>.<br />The zany cowboy spoof, BLAZING SADDLES is Mel Brooks' and Gene Wilder's other comedic masterpiece.

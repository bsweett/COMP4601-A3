That is I thought the evolution of the movie's rules and causality would change by whim.  Instead, we get a "rock/ paper/ scissors" approach.  Each superhero has their own connecting powers, like one has fire and another has ice.  In this installment, the mutants find there is a cure for their powers, which some make into a crusade, others a curse.  There is a societal divide; one that breaks out with signs and protestors, but, unfortunately, like real life, it is too often resolved with violence.  (Will this be the fate of stem cell research, and was this something they had in mind for the movie's theme?)  Anyway, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Phoenix (Famke Jensen) have a consequential love affair that has global--or at least environmental--consequences.  The visual effects throughout are stunning and Storm (played skillfully by Halle Berry) and others give us capable performances for the plot's urgency.  Stately figures like Magneto (Ian McKlellen) and Sir Henry (Kelsey Grammer) give some weightiness to the story's edge.  Interesting and eye-popping, 'X-Men- The Last Stand' is impressive--even for a "newbie" like me.  Storm leaves us with words to live by at slain Professor X's funeral, "We live in an age of darkness--a world full of hate, fear, and intolerance. In every age there are those who try to fight it." In 'X-Men- The Last Stand' they do it in style.</p></body></html>

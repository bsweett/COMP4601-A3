<meta name="summary" content="Overrated but decent character piece"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Doubt works much better in its quiet moments (Viola Davis's scene springs to mind) when it eschews the thundering acting that works better on the boards than on the screen; the film is still worth seeing due to the convincing nature of the performances (exception: a weak Amy Adams) and several worthwhile scenes, but this trivial piece of Oscar-bait will not be remembered for very long.<br /><br />2.5/4</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Final Destination"></head><body><p>Four friends are going to Paris for a class field trip.  While on the plane, a guy named Billy has a premonition of the plane exploding.  When he wakes up, he warns his friends of what he saw.  He makes a scene on the plane, and gets himself and three of his friends kicked off the plane.  When outside, the four see the plane take off and EXPLODE.  From then on, the people who didn't die in the crash (the four who escape the plane), they die one by one in mysterious ways throughout the movie.  the deaths are disgusting and unrealistic.  Overall, I thought this was a good movie to watch, but if you are the faint at heart, then I recommend you not watch it.  I love this stuff, but some parts I had to cover my eyes.</p></body></html>

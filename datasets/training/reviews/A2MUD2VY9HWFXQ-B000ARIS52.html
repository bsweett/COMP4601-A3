Whomever did the cinematography for "Sin City" should get an Oscar.<br /><br />Stylish, action packed, visually stunning, and loaded with a tremendous cast- this movie delivers the goods in every scene and is the only movie based on a comic that actually comes across as a "live-action" comic book.<br /><br />This is a fantastic film--although I'm not really sure I understood all the stories behind it (Ill just have to see it again); it doesnt really matter.<br /><br />Wonderful eye candy with awesome direction and cameos throughout!<br /><br />This is the most original movie I have seen all summer!! It is definitely a masterpiece of direction and photography!!<br /><br />SEE OR BUY THIS MOVIE!!</p></body></html>

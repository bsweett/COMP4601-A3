Originally conceived a few years back, with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the feature roles, along with a much larger budget than the end result, The Fountain was put on indefinite hiatus thanks to nearly every party involved backing out.  Shortly there after, Aronofsky adapted his story into a graphic novel for DC Comics' mature readers imprint Vertigo, and soon enough, the film would be resurrected to be what we have now.  And be glad it was.  The Fountain is, for lack of a better word, a triumph of modern film making.  Hugh Jackman stars as Tom in this metaphysical love story spanning a thousand years.  Beginning as a Spanish conquistador, continuing as a present day desperate doctor, and finally as an interstellar traveler, Tom tries again and again to cheat death and ensure an eternity with his dearly beloved Izzi (Rachel Weisz), only to lose her time and again as well.  Aronofsky's theme and look at the inevitability of death is powerful to say the least.  It's no secret that Aronofsky doesn't present the film in the most accessable manner, nor is that his intention.  This is not a film that one can just walk into and know what to expect: The Fountain is a slow moving and heart wrenching journey that isn't easy to take, but for those that do, they will find something that is truly special indeed.  Jackman gives the absolute best performance of his career, and that, as well as the amazing special effects (mostly done without CGI!) are worth the price of admission alone.  Simply put, The Fountain is a masterpiece of modern film making; but be forewarned, this is not a film for all tastes and audiences.  If you do check it out and are not sure what to make of it, give it a second viewing, and above all, give it a chance.</p></body></html>

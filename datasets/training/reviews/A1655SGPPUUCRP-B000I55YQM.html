Although two soldiers were killed in the firefight, the rest were led to safety by Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), including the platoon's leader, Major Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington). As a result, Shaw, the son of the esteemed Senator Eleanor Shaw (Meryl Streep), became a Medal of Honor winner and parlayed his heroism into a political career. Marco, on the other hand, spends his days giving speeches where he mindlessly recites the details of the firefight and spends his nights suffering from surreal nightmares that suggest that there might have been more to that fateful night than what he remembers.  Or what he thinks he remembers.<br /><br />Political junkies will have a lot of fun with the jabs the film takes at the gullibility of the news' media and the buying and selling of whorish politicians.  From Saudi Arabia to John Kerry to Halliburton, the movie rarely stops to take a breath from drawing parallels between its fictional world and the world we reside in.  Sometimes it comes uncomfortably close, giving the film a sense of dread that will most likely only be noticed by the politically conscious.<br /><br />Director Jonathan Demme does his best to keep the film entertaining for the apolitical with his snazziest directing since "The Silence of the Lambs".  The dream sequences are frenzied, distorted and disturbing.  Demme achieves the same sense of dread here as he did in "The Silence of the Lambs" with numerous flashbacks and nightmares just as in John Frankenheimer's original.<br /><br />This film is blessed with an incredible cast.  Meryl Streep gives a truly creepy performance as Senator Eleanor Shaw, a virtual Hillary Clinton clone.  Liev Schreiber manages to be scary, frightened, threatening and vulnerable, all in the same scene.  Denzel Washington gives one of the most compelling performances of his career as Ben Marco.  Washington manages to hold his own against constant comparison to Frank Sinatra's portrayal of Marco in the original.  The fear Washington's Marco is feeling washes over the audience and kept everyone on the edge of their seats.<br /><br />"The Manchurian Candidate" is a smart contemporary film that takes familiar genre conventions and gives them a reasonably intelligent spin. True, it doesn't hold a candle to John Frankenheimer's original and it never comes close to approximating the boldness of the original film. However, it is a slick thriller that contains some first-rate performances and moves along quickly and efficiently.  Unlike "The Stepford Wives" remake, "The Manchurian Candidate" is a good film that can stand on its own two feet; a sign of a decent remake.  While it doesn't hold a candle to the original film, 50 years from now people will still be watching Frankenheimer's version, it doesn't do it any grave dishonor either.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Always know if the person you're conning isn't conning you...."></head><body><p>Matchstick Men is a story of one man by the name of Roy who is germophobic, is obsessive compulsive, and just happens to be a con man......<br /><br />Nicholas Cage plays Roy, a man who is utterly brilliant when it comes to conning other people. However he considers himself to be a con "Artist," that is, he doesn't take people's money by force. He also absolutely despises harsh language, instead of using any bad word he simply says, "Oh Pygmies!"<br /><br />He is also obsessive compulsive; his rituals include closing and opening doors three times in a row while saying the numbers out loud, and sometimes even in a different language. He lives on keeping his carpet clean, sometimes reminding people three or four times to always take off their shoes before they step on the carpet.<br /><br />Roy's world is turned upside down when he realizes that his ex wife's 14 year old daughter [Allison Lohman] heard about him trying to talk to her mother and wants to meet him. In the few awkward moments that he meets his daughter, Roy feels drawn to her, in a sort of protective father figure.<br /><br />I found that the relationship with Roy and Angela, his daughter, was very heartwarming, and genuine. A father trying to make up for 14 years of not growing up with her, and a girl who is curious about her father's past and what he does, and also acts as a rebellious child. [But all teens act like that]<br /><br />It doesn't take long for Roy to start taking Angela on some of his cons to teach her after being pressured into it by her to begin with. One very good scene involves an old lottery ticket that won 600 bucks, only to have a woman give 300 to Angela for finding the ticket. But Roy's responsible parent comes into play and makes Angela give the money back.<br /><br />This is a great movie, one of the best of Nicholas Cage's career. His portrayal as a man who is desperate to be a father and to make his life simple is brilliant. The big twist at the end, which you can see clearly the second time you watch this movie, is done brilliantly as well.<br /><br />This is definately a movie worth checking out.</p></body></html>

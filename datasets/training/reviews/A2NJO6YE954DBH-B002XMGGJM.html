<meta name="summary" content="Do not be surprised if your sympathies end up with the bad guy in this one"></head><body><p>"Law Abiding Citizen" is a thriller with a fairly unique twist in that the bad guy is already in prison when he gets serious about killing people.  The victim of a brutal home invasion, Clyde Shelton (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009XN4C">Gerard Butler</a>) has to watch as his wife and daughter are savagely murdered.  Then the American criminal justice system adds insult to injury when Philadelphia assistant district attorney Nick Rice (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y7WGOW">Jamie Foxx</a>) decides to plead the case out, despite the protestations and outrage of Clyde.  The details justifying the plea bargain are rather nebulous, because the main idea is to set up the profound sense of injustice that will send Clyde off the deep end.  Even if Clyde's eye-witness testimony would be suspect in court, it is certainly enough for Nick to make sure that even if the letter of the law dictates that both criminals are equally culpable for the murders that the one Clyde insists did the actual killing is not the one who gets the better deal.  Certainly the D.A. can make the same deal with the other guy.  But the devil is not in the details here, so all that really matters is that Clyde sees Nick shaking hands with the scum of the earth who killed his family.  Once the prologue is ten years past, we get to the execution of the guy who got the short end of the deal and things go horribly wrong.  Then Nick uses a more direct approach to dispatch of the thug who did the actual killing, showing a flair worthy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385496982">Dante</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SSOHC">Jigsaw</a>.<br /><br />I would say that my problem with this 2009 film is that my sympathies are way more with Clyde than with Nick, but to tell the truth I did not mind rooting for Clyde, even though he is admittedly not in the same class as previous guilty pleasure bad guys like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014K5ZA">Richard III</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LINC">Hannibal Lecter</a>.  The main selling point of the movie is that you get caught up way more with "what" he is doing and "how" he is doing, especially since you already know the "why."  Each "what" is a fairly sophisticated way of disposing of the people on his hit list , while the "how" has to do with the fact that for most of the movie Clyde is not only in prison, but in solitary confinement.  Screenwriter Kurt Wimmer, who also wrote the script for the remake of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305657947">The Thomas Crown Affair</a>," certainly knows how to come with elegant crimes, although this time around the goal is to kill people rather than steal paintings, and I like the explanation for how Clyde is able to do all that he does, once we finally get around to the origins of his peculiar set of skills.  Beyond that, Nick does not fit the bill as a worthy hero, not only because he is slow to catch on that people are dying because he is several moves behind in this killer chess game, but also because he fails to see himself as being culpable in any way, shape, or form for the gross injustice that set all of this in motion.  The more Nick stuck to his "principles" and refused to follow Clyde's instructions, the more I was actually hoping for an ironic ending where Nick literally feels Clyde's pain.  Director F. Gary Gray ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000B1OFL">The Italian Job</a>") goes a bit over the top with the big ending, which really runs counter to the feel of the rest of the film, but that is probably what happens when the mandated ending is an attempt to balance the scales before the end credits.  After all, we cannot have somebody bringing down our criminal justice system, can we?  Consequently, "Law Abiding Citizen" is one of those films where the journey is better than the final destination.<br /><br />This last paragraph is only for the eyes of those who have seen the film, so beware: there be spoilers here.  While watching this movie I was bothered by the whole idea that Clyde Shelton has an accomplice who works as the "Mr. Outside" counterpart to his "Mr. Inside," simply because there are really no logical possibilities to who that might be.  A lot of times in movies you can figure out the surprise because there are only a limited number of possible suspects.  So I was pretty much convinced they were going to have to pull one out of left field, and was actually pleased when they avoided doing that.  However, I was less enamored with the convenient mistakes that Clyde made to allow Nick to put two and two together in the final reel.  I also understand why Nick was so slow to catch on to the fact that Clyde has already put everything in place before he made his first demand behind bars.  Of course, the more I think about this film the more flaws I find in it, even if they were not painfully apparent during my first viewing.  However, I find it interesting that most of my thoughts are about the few but key changes Clyde could have done to ensure his plan played out to its intended end.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Francisco - That's Fun To Say!""></head><body><p>ELF is a warm humorous family Christmas tale.  Will Ferrell is hilarious as Buddy who in his own words is a "human raised by elves."  That's elves like Santa's employees not the ones that inhabit Tolkien's Middle-earth.  Needless to say Buddy has several differences from his adopted family and friends most notably his size which provides quite a few laughs in the first few minutes of the film.  The major plot point occurs when Buddy gets to meet his biological father, a stern man played by James Caan, who works as a children's book publisher in New York City.  There are misunderstandings at first between the naive Buddy and his city smart dad but a happy ending is in store for father, son and extended elf family.</p></body></html>

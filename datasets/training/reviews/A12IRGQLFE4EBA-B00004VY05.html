The first time I saw it I actually did not like it.  Then I took a second look and was blown away.  Everything just pops out at you.  Chris Tucker's performance is hilarious and Milla Jovovich was awesome.  This is a strange one -- may take some of us slower folks to see the brilliance in it, but what a wild ride!</p></body></html>

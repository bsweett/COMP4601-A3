Taking many Jack the Ripper legends, the Hughes brothers have created an amazing patchwork quilt of interlinking stories that are drawn together to reveal the identity of a mass murderer who was never bought to justice.  The most famous legend is that the Queen's son and heir to the throne married a commoner, Annie Crook and she bore him a child, and it is this setting that sets the film off on a ride to hell and back.  Abberline doggedly searches for a killer who has taken on mythical qualities, and bit-by-bit he puts together an intricate plot, of royal intrigue and scandal, insanity and corruption in high places.  Not that Abberline is uncorrupted himself, addicted to opium and haunted by the death of his wife in childbirth, he is already half-way to hell himself but redemption comes in the form of Mary Kelly, a beautiful fallen Irish girl who he strives to protect against all odds.  But Abberline is up against the British establishment and the might of Her Majesty's empire, in the guise of Sir Charles Warren played excellently by Ian Richardson and Sir William Gull, Ian Holm at his schizophrenic best.  We are treated to a tour around Victorian London with all its vices from drug taking to rampant prostitution whilst we head for the shattering climax that will reveal everything.  &quot;From Hell&quot; is a film of extraordinary color and vicious vitality.  The camera work is superb and the constant shadowy silhouette of Jack the Ripper gives an eerie feel to an already creepy film.  Blood is aplenty in this film and it is not a movie for the squeamish.  The worst scene is at the end when Jack kills Mary Kelly (there's a little twist here that will amuse those of a dark nature) and Ian Holm just explodes on the screen with the madness of someone on a holy quest for the British Empire.  The lobotomy scene where Annie is driven into madness is also quite disturbing, but there is justice for Annie in an ironic twist at the end of the film.  This movie isn't a horror film though it has horrific qualities.  I do think that many scenes were cut out which I hope will be incorporated onto DVD in the future because I notice from the cast list there are characters we never saw on screen like Annie Crook's parents.  However, despite this minor detail &quot;From Hell&quot; is a truly amazing film, with just enough suspense to make you sit on the edge of your seat, and just enough gore to make you, swallow hard and think &quot;oh gross&quot; before being distracted by another scene that makes you think real hard because of its complexity.  On a final note, Robbie Coltrane is the bomb as Abberline's cynical but good-hearted Sergeant, Peter Godley whose understanding of human nature is understated and truly awesome.  A cast of quality actors all the way through, from the doomed friends of Mary Kelly, through to little Alice Crook, the daughter of the ill-fate Annie and her husband, Albert, aka the future King of England.</p></body></html>

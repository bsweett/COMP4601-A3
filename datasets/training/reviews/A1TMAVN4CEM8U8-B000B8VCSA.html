<meta name="summary" content="MATT DAMON WAS BORN TO BE JASON BORNE"></head><body><p>The Bourne Supremacy<br /><br />The Borne Supremacy takes over where the Bourne Identity left off.  Jason Borne played by Matt Damon is still searching for his true identity and why someone is out to kill him.  One thing leads to another and Jason finds himself in Berlin.  A truly good action adventure.  I wonder if it was an accident that Robert Ludlum chose a name with the same initials as Fleming's James Bond?<br />Highly recommended for Ludlum fans and for fans of high adventure.<br /><br />Gunner  October,  2007</p></body></html>

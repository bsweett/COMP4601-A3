I heard good things about it and more power to them cause it's better than I was told it pwans. 2 people caught my eye in particular Liam Neeson & Fammke Janseen I like her as an actrees. I'll say for a PG13 film it's hardcore. Basically Liam Neeson plays a retired government agent or CIA something in that order and just wants to spend time with his teenaged daughter Kim who has wants to become a pop star. She has a friend who wants her to go to Paris with her while in Paris Kim and her friend Amanda are kidnapped and basically she's on the phone with her dad. and he records the phone call he goes to Paris he only has 4 days to find his daughter.It's a race against time and because his daughter is in a human trafficking ring and has to find her. If you love Movies like Commando revenge flicks like Hard to Kill  I mean there have been great films but this actually lived up to the hype.</p></body></html>

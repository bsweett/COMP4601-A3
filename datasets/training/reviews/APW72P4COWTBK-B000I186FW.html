<meta name="summary" content="Better than Constantine and Count of Monte Cristo 2001!!!"></head><body><p>I gave it 3 stars because the movie is VERY SLOW and there are very few action scenes (I think that the ending was the only action scene in particular).<br /><br />At least! This movie have BETTER action scenes, special effects, story, concept and characters than Constantine and Count of Monte Cristo 2001. Those movies have a very similar storyline and action to this one, but V for Vendetta is MUCH COOLER and bloodier than those two. Infact, those two movies were kind of boring.<br /><br />I think that this is the best movie of the NWOHAM (New Wave of Hollywood Action Movies),<br /><br />P.S: If you enjoy more the story than the action then this movie was made for you.<br /><br />Adios.</p></body></html>

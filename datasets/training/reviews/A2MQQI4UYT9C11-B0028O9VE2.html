<meta name="summary" content="Ride 'em ,Tea!"></head><body><p>One week last year, my wife and I each picked a romantic comedy as rental fare. Her choice, "Spanglish", came first. It wasn't hugely attractive to me--I've never been much of an Adam Sandler fan (excluding Punch Drunk Love, which was a hoot), and Tea Leoni has to answer for her appearance in the awful "Sudden Impact". One potential positive was direction by James Brooks, who did Terms of Endearment (which in retrospect was quite similar to Steel Magnolias) about 20 years ago.<br /><br />I hung in for the entire 130 minutes of this tale of culture clash in Southern California. A Mexican women and her young daughter emigrate to the U.S. After six years working for peanuts in the barrio where everyone speaks Spanish, Flor (the woman) realizes that she needs to enter the Anglo world to find a better paying job, which she finds as a housekeeper for Sandler, Leoni and family. Sandler is a successful chef. Leoni is an achievement-oriented basket case. The Hispanic actress and her daughter are gorgeous. Cloris Leachman has a nice turn as Leoni's mother. The girl who plays the Claskys' daughter is terrific, but I just couldn't get past Sandler and Leoni to really enjoy this film, even though the story has some resonance and wasn't necessarily resolved in the "happily-ever after" fashion that you'd expect. The title refers both to the culture clash, and to the housekeeper's belated efforts to learn English, so as to better control the Claskys' influence on her daughter's life.<br /><br />I think most folks would enjoy this one better than I did (the rest of my family did). As a warning to parents, despite the PG (13) rating there's one clothed, but fairly explicit otherwise, sex scene between the two stars (ride 'em Tea!)</p></body></html>

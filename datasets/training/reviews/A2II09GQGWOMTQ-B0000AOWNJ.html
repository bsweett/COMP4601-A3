<meta name="summary" content="The new wave of "J" horror."></head><body><p>Saw The Ring, loved the ring.<br />The acting, the story, direction, atmosphere is superb.<br />It is more slowly paced than American horror movies but I loved it.<br />It builds more suspense.<br />The music is amazing.<br />There really isn't anything bad to say about this movie.<br />Of all the "J" horror films that have come to America, The Ring is probably the best of the bunch.<br />Too bad the sequel sucked, and I hope Hollywood has the sense to stop now.</p></body></html>

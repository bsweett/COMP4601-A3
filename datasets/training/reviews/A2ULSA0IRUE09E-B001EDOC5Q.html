The wonderful books have been reduced to 'Fantasy for Dummies' here, with production values and acting befitting a late night TV Special. And not in a good way.<br /><br />From the moment the movie began, I had trouble staying awake, only because it seemed to be a really uninspired rehash of the LOTR special effects, but only with less heart or interest. All of the child actors are absolutely useless. They make Macaulay Culkin look like Peter O'Toole - I'm serious. I'm sure 'deadpan' is a cinematic style and all, but these kids have taken it to a whole new level.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the talking lion was just ridiculous. Let me see, he does a 'fancy thing' with a river here, and thats supposed to be the films' big highlight? I just don't get the positive reviews for this film. It was poorly made, badly acted, with elves, dwarves, talking mice, fairies etc all thrown in just because they appeared in the book (and sometimes not even)<br /><br />Of course, chances are you might just love this, but my own two cents was that it was an absolute waste of time and money. Not to mention I could have been at home fast asleep, or better still, watching reruns of "The Nanny"<br /><br />Two Generous Stars<br /><br />PS : I see glowing reviews here for Ben Barnes who plays the Prince. I see him as a less gifted Jesse Metcalfe (the gardener from "Desperate Housewives") minus the sixpack and half-hearted charisma.</p></body></html>

Mark Walhberg's character, Bob Lee Swagger, is the best sniper/marksman out there & trained by our government's military.<br /><br />When Bob Lee Swagger is left to fend for himself while in combat by our country's military, he decides to retreat from society disillusioned that his own country would leave him to possibly die in enemy territory while serving his country.<br /><br />Three years later, the government comes a knocking once again on Bob Lee Swagger front door, asking him to serve his country once again. This time they want him to figure out how and where a sniper might hide in order to kill the president during a set of public speaking engagements. In doing this task, Bob Lee Swagger becomes a prime suspect in the conspiracy to kill the President by the very same people whom have asked him to help them! Bob Lee Swagger must flee for his life after being shot, avoid being captured, and attempt to clear his name with the aid of two other people.<br /><br />It seems highly likely that Bob Lee Swagger could survive being shot, avoid being captured by the FBI, and attempt to clear his name with ONLY the aid of two other people.... One of whom is an amateur! This movie is all about revenge, vigilante style. It is sort of a modern day version of a Charles Bronson flick, but with Bob Lee Swagger having a little more compassion and depth of character then Bronson's characters.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A love letter to the NRA, strangely enough"></head><body><p>This inspiring movie should be shown at every NRA annual banquet, along with Schindler's List, as cautionary tales about a totally powerless and disarmed populace. Also a testament to the utter uselessness of the United Nations, who have presided over a couple more massacres and genocides in our time. "The West" is criticized for not intervening, but isn't the UN the voice of the whole world? If "The West" was immoral and wrong not to intervene (and I'm quite sure the US wanted to step in there and vaporize those murdering scum) where was the rest of the planet? Where was the moral voice of the UN? Nowhere, apparently. A familiar scenario.<br /><br />This movie paints a horrifying picture that we can only hope to avoid by sending oodles of cash to Smith and Wesson. The total helplessness of the unarmed citizenry will make you want to find your nearest gun dealer. I mean, really, that's the thought running through your mind the whole film. That's why even proponents of gun control have been found to own their own guns, like Carl Rowan. I myself don't have one, but this movie made me think about it.</p></body></html>

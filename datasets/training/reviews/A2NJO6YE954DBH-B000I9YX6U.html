<meta name="summary" content="Robin Williams in a sustained performance of creepiness"></head><body><p>Proving that he had depths of creepiness untouched by his performance in "Insomnia," Robin Williams puts on some weight, dyes his hair blonde, and inhabits the body and less than complete life of Sy Parrish, who works at the photo lab at the local Sav*Mart (writer-director Mark Romanek talks about it being like a K-Mart or Target, but I am sure everybody who watches this immediately thinks Wal-Mart).  During all that time that he has been processing photographs, Sy has taken what can only be characterized as an unhealthy interest in the family of Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) and her son Jake (Dylan Smith).  Nina has a husband, Will (Michael Vartan), who works too much, but it turns out there are other more serious problems with the perfect life Sy has seen while developing her photographs all these years.  <p>Sy is a nobody, a non-entity dismissed by the rest of the world who sees everything that his life is not in the photographs he develops for the Yorkins.  He sees himself as their "Uncle Sy," a kindly Dutch Uncle.  But Sy has a dark side, which only comes out when something he cares about, such as the setting of cyan on the photo printer, goes wrong, and as Sy starts to work his way into the lives of the Yorkins away from Sav*Mart he finds a fatal flaw in their perfect lives.  After all, Sy does not just develop photographs for them; he just always prints an extra set just for himself.  <p>However, for me there is one rather giant hole in this plot and that has to do with the access that Sy has to the entire store, especially after he is given the ax.  I have to tell you that I have worked in places that have fired employees and stood there watching them empty out their desks.  Under the circumstances that leave to Sy's termination, and given the antipathy that Bill Ownes (Gary Cole) feels for him, it just stretches the limits of my credulity that what happens would be allowed to happen.  <p>However, "One Hour Photo" earns back points because at the end of the film we find out, along with Detective Van Der Zee (Eriq LaSalle), not only why Sy did what he did, but also what he did--and it all fits together.  We are not talking about a stunning, spectacular resolution, but simply something that provides the final piece of the puzzle.  Lots of films never get that far and combined with the sustained creepiness of Robin Williams's performance, that is enough to warrant checking out "One Hour Photo."</p></body></html>

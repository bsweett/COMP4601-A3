I'm a huge fan of the first one, which I think is an action/adventure masterpiece, but the next two films are merely okay IMHO; although Sylvester Stallone never looked better and the locations are fabulous in these sequels, the stories are too comic-booky and the characters are cardboard. In other words, there's very little depth, if any. This third sequel makes up for all that because it's not cartooney at all and there's quite a bit of depth, albeit not much in dialogue form.<br /><br />THE STORY: John Rambo is alone & bitter and living hand-to-mouth in Thailand when a group of Christian missionaries enlist him to take them into Burma (aka Myanmar) to aid a village of people. Rambo strongly discourages them in light of the political instability of the country, which includes heavy persecutions and mass slayings, but they insist on trying to help so he does it anyway. Weeks later he learns the missionaries have been taken captive so he goes back with a group of mercenaries to bring them out, if possible.<br /><br />"Rambo" combines elements of "Apocalypse Now," "The Killing Fields" and the first two Rambo films and is ultra-serious & intense from beginning to end, not to mention it's probably the most violent film ever made. No lie. The picture powerfully illustrates the best and worst in humanity. The Christian missionaries are willing to risk everything to help the villagers, whereas the Myanmar militarists revel in slaughtering scores of unarmed people for "fun;" they're also shown abusing/raping women and boys. Obviously they've given themselves wholly over to the darkside of their natures. Such reprobates are only worthy of one thing: Utter annihilation.<br /><br />Numerous important themes are addressed in the picture (besides the main theme noted above):<br /><br />-- Bitterness/despair and deliverance. The beginning of the film shows Rambo in a complete state of bitterness: He's just existing. He has no friends. He doesn't talk much and, when he does, it's very few words laced with expletives. The male leader of the missionaries is completely unable to talk him into helping them. Two Biblical proverbs state "a gentle answer turns away wrath" and "a gentle tongue can break a bone." The female missionary (Julie Benz) knows this and skillfully talks John into helping them. Yet there's more going on here than just that. This woman with a heart of gold is Rambo's "golden connection" out of the horrible rut of bitterness he's fallen into. Despite his gruff exterior, she sees something in him, something in his eys -- a good heart, even greatness, a genuine glimmer however faint. Is Rambo helping the missionaries or is she the one helping him? John instinctively realizes the rope she's throwing him and takes hold of it. There's nothing sensual about their relationship, despite her (realistic) attractiveness; it's solely spiritual. She stirs in him the hope and faith he's been longing for for too long.<br /><br />-- Violence is not always necessary. Although this is the most violent film ever made it skillfully shows when pacifism is appropriate. Note the incident on Rambo's riverboat when the lead mercenary continuously insults John and tries to provoke him into a fight. Rambo completely ignores him, choosing not even say a word. In other words, he refuses to allow someone to victimize him and draw him into a conflict that has no positive purpose. It takes true strength to do this and Rambo has this strength. Indeed, John treats the guy as if he's a bothersome gnat. What do you do when a gnat bothers you? Do you break out a machine gun or merely ignore it?<br /><br />-- Total pacifism does not work. I'm a Christian and would like to point out that the New Testament does not support the idea of absolute pacifism. Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box with loads of money and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves and murderers. Also, Romans 13 clearly states the righteous laws of human governments are God-ordained for the purpose of punishing criminals, including the right to execute when appropriate. The vast majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extemists who refuse to be BALANCED with the Scriptures on this subject and insist that conflict and especially armed conflict is NEVER appropriate. The lead male missionary in the film is such a person (which I found unrealistic btw), but he learns the error of his ways before the story is over. This is an important point: Some people are so morally degenerate and evil that execution is the only just ultimate reaction (notice I said "ultimate").<br /><br />-- The possibility of Rambo's spiritual rebirth [SPOILER ALERT! Don't read this paragraph unless you've already seen the film and/or want to entertain possible insights]. Although the first two sequels are cartooney and lack depth they show Rambo searching for truth and flirting with religion and spirituality. In the second film he gets a Buddhist necklace off of the Asian woman he befriends (who, of course, dies) and at the beginning of "Rambo III" he is shown working at a Buddhist temple and helping out the priests there; later, he meets and wins the hearts of (moderate) Islamic villagers and gives his Buddhist necklace to a Muslim boy who helped him out. In "Rambo," as previously noted, the female missionary is key in John's positive transformation; at one point she gently asks him whether or not he has any family back in the USA. He mumbles that he might have a father, he really wasn't sure, and obviously didn't care at that point. She later gives him a cross necklace for helping them out (he wouldn't take money). Anyway, the end of the film shows Rambo back in America walking to his family ranch. Obviously John had a profoundly positive spiritual metamorphosis in the story. The precise nature and extent of this change is not known, unless there's (hopefully) a fifth film [END SPOILER].<br /><br />"Rambo" was written and directed by Sylvester Stallone and filmed in Thailand. The locations are magnificent.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: One reviewer said he went to see "Rambo" for some mindless action & laughs but was unexpectedly and deeply moved instead. The story only runs 80 minutes, not including credits, and it's ultra-intense from beginning to end. In fact, I don't suggest seeing the film right before you go to bed because you'll likely be too riled up by the onslaught of violence and intensity to sleep.<br /><br />"Rambo" is easily the second best of the series, second only to the first one; even that's debatable.<br /><br />Personal Grade: A</p></body></html>

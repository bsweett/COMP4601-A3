<meta name="summary" content="When old-school ethics face a violence without reason."></head><body><p>Our opening scene begins with one of the more powerful voice-overs I've heard in film, a voice that challenges humanity itself with its scratchy lines and raw, buring outlook that continues to haunt me. The vintage sheriff type (played and voiced by Tommy Lee Jones) states, "You can't help but compare yourself gainst the oldtimers. Can't help but wonder how they would've operated these times. There was this boy I sent to the gas chamber at Huntsville here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killed a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn't any passion to it. Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he'd do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. Be there in about fifteen minutes. I don't know what to make of that. I surely don't. The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure. It's not that I'm afraid of it. I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job - not to be glorious. But I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand. To go into something you don't understand you would have to be crazy or *become part of it*."<br /><br />This series of voice-over encapsulates the film's point - that evil no longer needs a reason, and probably never did; only now, evil is more prevalent and the old ways of handling evil? Well, they're are finished. They simply won't work anymore.<br /><br />So begins our film. The war that rages in this film is not so much that of a bounty hunter pitted against the man who stole his employer's money, or even of a conflict between an aging sheriff and a heartless killer. The war that resides here is that of ideas. On one hand, we have the idea that holds tightly to a belief that evil needs a reason and follows a code, however shady that code might be, and combating such an evil follows a line of logic. On the other, we have a thoughtless method of killing, where life has no value, and one's death resides as easily on the flip of a coin. It's in this film where the conflict of those two ideas converge, and as reality sets in on Jones' character and those around him, it's clear that evil no longer follows anything, and that some are incapable of rational thought or the slimmest forms of mercy.<br /><br />No Country For Old Men is a difficult, but probably necessary watch for those who study the nature of man and the combating elements which confound logical thought. It's also an excellent piece of cinema. I've never in my life been on the edge of my seat during so many scenes, or at the same time found myself not caring for any of the characters, except perhaps the Carla Jean Moss character. Even she, however, seems just another pawn in a deeper study on the nature of man and the things we'd hope we are as opposed to the things we actually exhibit.</p></body></html>

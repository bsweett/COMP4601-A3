Others may plump for Star Wars as the most influential film of the 70s, and maybe they are right.  But I think overall The Godfather still resonates with us the most, more than 30 years later.  Such expressions as "An offer you can't refuse" and "Sleeps with fishes" are now so commonplace they don't even have to be explained anymore, nor do we think where we first learned about them.  Virtually our whole knowledge of mafia culture, our entire understanding of how the machine of organized crime works, comes from this movie (or is filtered from this movie through other movies).  So many moments of this film--the kissing of the rings, the horse's head, the baptism/massacre--have become icons of mafia films, and crime films in general.  If The Godfather had flopped, a whole score of 80s and 90s films, TV shows and even Simpsons parodies ("You bring mucha joy to this old Italian stereotype") would not have happened.<br /><br />What's hard to believe is that through much of the production, the film was believed to be in serious trouble.  Coppola's battles with the studio execs have been well-chronicled; as incredible as it may seem today, he was nearly canned in mid-production.  (Supposedly he received a telegram from the producers at one point that said, "Don't quit, make them fire you.")  One looks at the product and wonders why.  The studio was very unenthusiastic for Al Pacino as Michael--again, one looks at the tests (available on a separate supplement disc that does not come with this set, sadly) and wonders why.  They reportedly wanted someone more "out" there, more animated.  But Pacino's performance strikes me as perfectly right in how the changes come from within, from a spiritual metamorphoses we never really see, but only see the effects of.  Although Brando (another unpopular choice with the studio) received much justified attention for his role, a role that *is* remarkable, it's Michael who is the most interesting character for me, as he goes from fish out of water to mob genius in an onscreen transition that is so magnificent in its deliberate pacing.  He picks the night he visits his father at the hospital to begin Michael's transformation from family outsider to center of the Corleones.  Thus that scene is one of the most pivotal, even though it's not often discussed when one hears about great moments in The Godfather.  Similarly, his shooting of the Turk and the police captain is brilliant in the way he incorporates but does not blindly follow the advice the more experienced members of the mob family give him.  He's already, at this early stage, thinking on his own.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is excellent as well, with the exception of Talia Shire, who I've always found to be somewhat weak and whose dialogue in the last scene had to be completely overdubbed for some reason (and whose delivery still isn't convincing).<br /><br />What makes the movie special, to me, is how this clubby world, usually presented so exotic and mysteriously, was for its participants just a "business," with hit men planning murders while their wives cook dinner and their children play in the next room.  Again, it's hard to appreciate 30+ years later how this view changed our perception of the mob world.  Prior films tended to portray gangsters as shiny-shoed polished types spouting spiffy dialogue.  This film was brave enough to show them for what they were--ordinary people, aside from what they do.<br /><br />The look of the film was equally radical for the time.  Gordon Willis--"The Price of Darkness," you either love him or hate him--likes to start with a completely black canvas and let in light and color grudgingly.  I am a fan of his very harsh, anti-Hollywood approach, even though it has since been abused by many people and occasionally even by him.  (He admits now that there were a few scenes where he overdid the darkness, and he would reshoot them today.)  The idea of giving the film a yellow tint caught on, and now so many period films have this look that I'd almost like to see it go away.  What's also interesting is how the camera is almost always very still, almost mimicking the slow, deliberate movements of the Don himself.<br /><br />It's delicious the way this film takes its time.  Editing like this is dead in this age of MTV and video equipment that allows itchy-fingered editing.  Like Chinatown, another masterpiece made around the same time by the same studio, The Godfather is in no hurry to divulge its secrets.  (Incidentally, take a look at the yellow car parked in the driveway of Woltz's mansion and compare it to Mrs. Mulwray's Packard in the Polanski film--the same prop?)  Yet, even at more than three hours in length, I actually wish the film were longer.  The sequence in Sicily feels too short and undeveloped to me.  At the same time, there's a laudable economy to the scenes, even though this is a long movie.  There's not one unnecessary moment or gesture in the film.<br /><br />It's sad, then, that Paramount seems so indifferent to this, one of a string of masterpieces they produced in the 70s.  The DVD is so lame that I have to subtract a whole star.  Actually, a more accurate rating would be the film gets five stars, while the DVD gets two-and-a-half.  The print is adequate--I've heard there are few good prints of this picture around, for some reason.  All the better reason to begin a full-blown restoration, I say.  The extras are slight--a director's commentary that is very interesting, but that's about all.  Paramout has released a complete Godfather trilogy with lots of goodies, but I don't want to be forced to buy the third film, which is a train wreck on top of a ten-car highway crash, just to get the extras.  So thumbs up to Coppola, Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan and the rest.  Thumbs down on Paramount, who can't seem to put together a compelling DVD to save their life.  Even with its flaws, though, this is a movie you can't refuse.  Bada-bang bada-bing!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Keira finally gets away from the period dramas"></head><body><p>I did buy this for someone else, but because the story intrigued me, I wanted to watch it too! I'd never got around to seeing it when it was released, so I thought I'd give it a go, although I was ready to dig my claws into Keira's performance.<br /><br />The story is about Adrien Brody, who plays a guy who gets shot in the head in Vietnam, and returns home. He then hitches a lift, but gets knocked out, and finds himself in court for killing a police officer. He then gets sent to a mental institution (which was actually Bangour Village Hospital in Scotland, not too far from where I live). There, he meets a sadistic doctor, who locks him in a morgue drawer on a regular basis.<br /><br />From here, the film gets complicated (but not as much as I expected) as Adrien's character travels forward in time into the future, where he meets Keira Knightley's character, and knows her from somewhere.<br /><br />I won't reveal too much more about the story, as you really have to watch it for yourself. But it's definitely an intriguing story, and very out there.<br /><br />I thought Adrien did a brilliant job the way he portrayed his confused character. There's quite a few crying scenes, which made me nearly start crying myself! There's also loads of closeup shots of eyes and stuff, which makes the viewer notice emotions more.<br /><br />I was surprised at Keira, she's mostly known for her period drama roles, and the press about her weight, nearly always overshadows what film role she's doing. The Jacket shows she can do something other than wear a corset, and play an interesting character at the same time. (Even if she does appear topless in the bath, a scene which is completely unnecessary to the film.) Plus, it's the best she's looked in a film yet. She looked stunning in most of the scenes, despite she was playing a reasonably awful looking character.<br /><br />The supporting cast are also excellent. Jennifer Jason Leigh was good, although her role could have been extended and the glasses just didn't work. The late Brad Renfro also appears. And also, Daniel Craig appears, and I spent the entire film insisting that was NOT Daniel Craig. (How wrong I was.) The past couple of years, we've been used to seeing him as suave and sophisticated Mr Bond, who can make the women weak at the knees. But in this, his image is completely different, to the point where I actually didn't recognise him. Oh my god, I still can't actually believe it's him.<br /><br />The Jacket is a film to be added to any film collection, it's really enjoyable, and will also get the brain working - I need it! Adrien Brody was absolutely brilliant, he made the film in my opinion.</p></body></html>

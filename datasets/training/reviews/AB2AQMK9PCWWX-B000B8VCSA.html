<meta name="summary" content="Third Damon/Bourne Movie will make the killing machine human"></head><body><p>....*more* human that is. I predict this because here we see little tidbits of info--revelation of Jason Bourne's real name, Jason's apology to the Russian gal for offing her parents, his relying on the by the book female honcho played by Joan Allen--that there may be a movie franchise in the making. This film is one you've gotta keep your eyes open for or you'll miss something...you can't doze for a second, because you'll miss him getting to, say, Berlin, por exemple (whaaat? how'd he get there?), to say nothing of the real-time car chases. (The one that is in India culminates in a manner which will blow your mind....). Matt has found a movie character that many will identify him as...ala Connery as Bond or Ford as Indy Jones.</p></body></html>

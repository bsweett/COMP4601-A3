<meta name="summary" content="Enough with the propaganda flicks, already!!!"></head><body><p>I never saw the original version of this movie, but when I saw the trailers for this release it promised to be a neat science fiction story.  Reeves is a so-so actor but I've seen decent performances from him in the past, so I decided to take my chances.  What a mistake!<br /><br />Aside from the uninspired acting from Reeves, Bates and, well, pretty much everyone else, and aside from some major league smarm with the cutesy and precocious little kid, the most prominent feature of this movie was the left-wing propaganda.  This film was fairly dripping with political correctness.  Just to make it clear, this would be equally objectionable if the movie was full of right-wing propaganda.  Can't we just get a good old-fashioned story anymore?<br /><br />Why Why Why?  Why do moviemakers lately seem to insist on making ill-advised and poorly disguised political statements, particularly in sci fi and horror movies (e.g. Shyamalan)?  This story is nothing but more of the same -- bashing the military and religion, while painting earth-friendly academics as the true saviors.  "We can change!  Give us a chance to save the earth!"  Gag me.  Stop the madness!  Just tell the story without all the half-baked moralizing.<br /><br />On a final note, I gave it the second star ONLY because the production was visually appealing and was replete with well-done special effects.  That, sadly, was the film's only redeeming quality.</p></body></html>

There are wonderful and unforgettable lines like "Bring out your dead" and "The knights who say nee".  It is loaded to the gills with humor and wit from the genius minds that brought you classics like "The Life of Brian" and "A Fish called Wanda".  That is just the movie itself now with the DVD you have a whole new level added to the experience.</p></body></html>

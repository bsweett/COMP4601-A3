<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Horror Film"></head><body><p>After seeing the original foreign version of this story called LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, I was prepared for another over-produced, over-wrought American version...but I am pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />In fact, I think I like this version better.  Set in a dark, wintry New Mexico with 80's songs playing just within hearing, this story about a lonely, bullied young boy who befriends a mysterious barefoot girl knows what needs to be done to tell a good story while not wallowing in gory excess.  Which is not to say there's none, but it's always just the right amount that the effects never overwhelm the story.  One definite improvement: I loved the attacks, which are so jarring as they come from a sweet little girl.  They also lend a poignancy to the scenes where she's trying to just find someone to connect with.<br /><br />One thing I would've addressed: was the little girl's "father" in the first half of the film once a child with her who ages as a human?  Kind of a dovetailing moment that could've been underscored a little clearer.<br /><br />But I'm quibbling.  An excellent horror film for all the fans who are tired of the mindless gorefests we have to endure these days.</p></body></html>

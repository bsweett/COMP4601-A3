<meta name="summary" content="A return to the franchise's roots"></head><body><p>Pirates of the Caribbean:On Stranger Tides(released May/11)is a welcome comeback for the franchise,which had bogged down in the second film,and started a slow climb up in the third;but not reaching quite up to the scale of the first film or this one.This one finds Depp firmly back in Sparrows character with all the "isms" he can muster,with a nicely edited and fast moving piece. .<br />The plot finds Sparrow in London and his first mate Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally)has been mistakenly dragged into court to face charges as...Jack Sparrow.The presiding judge is none other than the real Sparrow and he sentences his first mate to life in prison.In a typical switcharoo Sparrow accompanies his first mate as they are taken to prison,but when they arrive it seems they are both sentenced to die.Sparrow is brought before King George II(Richard Griffiths),who wants him to accompany his old nemesis Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush),to find the fabled fountain of youth(remember that compass from the last film?).Sparrow will have none of it and slips away from the crowded room.During his escapes he briefly runs into his father who gives him warnings re the fountain of youth and about an imposter of him that is trying to put a crew together.Sparrow ends up at a tavern and he meets his imposter,one Angelica(Pen&eacute;lope Cruz),who he deflowered in a convent years before and had not seen since.She claims she is the daughter of the infamous pirate Blackbeard,and before you can say Black Pearl,he is waylayed and brought on board Blackbeards ship.Back at the prison Barbarossa forces Sparrows first mate into servitude aboard his ship,as Gibbs also knows the location of the magical waters.<br />No one has seen Blackbeard,so Sparrow instigates a mutiny on his ship.He almost succeeds until Blackbeard appears before the crew and stops the mutiny in its tracks.With things settled into a manor more sided towards Blackbeard's purposes,the ship sails to find a mermaid from which its tears may be extracted,and Ponce de Leon's ship and the two chalices on board.Barbarossa is sailing also for the fountain but with a different purpose.It was Blackbeard that took the Black Pearl away from him and forced Barbarossa to cut his own leg off to save his life;so revenge,not youth,is on his mind.Add to all this the Spanish,who are also intent on finding the fountain,but again cross purposes to Blackbeard and Barbarossa;to destroy the fountain which is blasphemous to them and their Catholic beliefs.<br />Blackbeard captures a mermaid for her tears after a drawn and bloody battle.When they reach the land of the fountain,a decided impasse in the form of a cavernous ravine appears before them,at the bottom of which is a fast flowing river.Blackbeard forces Sparrow to jump into the water to search for Ponce De Leon's ship and the chalices.Jack finds the ship and Barbarossa;who has beat him to it.The ship sits on the edge of a cliff and they must both do a balancing act to get the cups.But they find the Spanish have beaten them to the punch.<br />Sparrow and Barbarossa raid the Spanish encampment and steal the cups.Jack and Barbarossa agree to work together to defeat Blackbeard.Sparrow returns with cups and takes Blackbeard to the fountain.Before long Barbarossa enters the picture,then the Spanish.A drawn and drag em out fight ensues with the Spanish trashing the fountain,Barabrossa getting his revenge on Blackbeard and Jack using the fountain to save Angelca's life.<br />Sparrow however strands Angelica on a desert island,Barbarossa returns to pirating on Blackbeards ship and Jack and his first mate start looking for a way to get the Black Pearl,in glass jar from Blackbeards ship,out of its prison.The film fades out as a voodoo doll of Jack,which Blackbeard had made,floats into the possession of a smiling Angelica.<br />Fast paced,well acted and scripted,the film is filled with Sparrow-isms and good doses of comedy.It is what made the first film so successful and I'm glad they have returned to this way of doing Pirates,once more.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.The only extras are commentary and deleted scenes.<br />A highly recommended fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.Its pace and sense of humour harkens back to the first one,taking most of its good,and dispensing with most of the bad.4-4 1/2 stars.</p></body></html>

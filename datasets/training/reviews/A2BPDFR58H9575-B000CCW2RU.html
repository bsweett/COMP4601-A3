<meta name="summary" content="The fast and furious attack of the clones"></head><body><p>"The Island", the combination of Action / Sci-Fi/ Thriller and more is quite enjoyable (it is always fun to see not just one but two Ewan Mcgregors on the screen; Scarlett has become a real beauty, and Steve Buscemi makes any film watchable) but easily forgettable summer blockbuster. "The Island" takes place in the near future and tells the story of a world where the cloning have became a reality and the wealthy citizens can and do order the clones in order to successfully treat their present or future health problems. The clones are living human beings with the feelings and dreams that have no idea about their destination which is to become the source for matching body parts, blood, and organ of the ones who paid for them. The movie raises very interesting, serious, and important ethical questions but does not have time to stop and to contemplate on them - it is too busy with the non-stoppable fast and furious action sequences.  It had the potentials of 'The Matrix" (first one) or "Minority Report" - it just did not happen.</p></body></html>

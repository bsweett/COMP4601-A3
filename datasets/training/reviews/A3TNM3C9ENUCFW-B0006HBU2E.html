<meta name="summary" content="4.5 Stars - Damon does it again!"></head><body><p>As others have already said, sequel territory is often littered with pitfalls, but considering the pedigree of Robert Ludlum's story (and that fact that he was executive producer) this is a very polished part II. Picking up immediately after the equally good Bourne Identity, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) returns after his self imposed exile in Goa is compromised. Implicated in a frame up, his previous employers now not only realise he is still alive, but at also large and suspect him of derailing a CIA exchange that goes awry. Filmed almost exclusively in Europe the action centers around Berlin & Moscow, and has some very impressive chase sequences and stuntwork. Damon continues to piece together his amnesia starved past, whilst trying to clear his name, and thwart the bad guys in a very fast paced cat and mouse thriller. A good supporting cast add credibilty to the story, and aside from some very choppy camera work in some action scenes, this movie is a gem. Puritans will complain about the sidestepping from the novels in places, but overall I feel this one of the top picks of the Summer releases. Enjoy</p></body></html>

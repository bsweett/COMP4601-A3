<meta name="summary" content="Exciting But Disturbing"></head><body><p>I wouldn't advise watching this movie just before you go to bed; it is a visually disturbing movie. Yes, there is a lot of exciting action, great chases, one on foot, and plenty of the bad guys getting what they deserve. That, for me, was not disturbing. I did watch the unrated version of the movie, not the theatrical version; it may be that some of the scenes which I found most disturbing are not in the theatrical release.<br /><br />The disturbing part to me was the picture of young people, especially young women, taking chances that can ruin their lives. The old saying that teenagers had better do what they're going to do while they're teenagers and still know everything seems to fit this movie all too well.<br /><br />A number of scenes showing the depravity of the slave trade are very saddening. Young women, imprisoned as prostitutes and chattel, graphically show the dangers that can lurk in societies today.<br /><br />One lasting impression is that there are too many really evil people out there today. I'm afraid that too many Americans have no notion of how bad things can sometimes get; they seem to believe that bad things only happen to someone else.<br /><br />I may watch the theatrical release later and see which scenes were deleted. The scenes in the unrated version made a convincing case for all of the actions taken by the father as he attempted to rescue his daughter.<br /><br />One of a number of issues that were glossed over was the lasting psychological impact of the experience on the daughter even after her rescue; she would never be the same again and would, I suspect, require extensive counseling to have any hope of resuming a normal life. Post traumatic stress disorder would be as much a problem for her as for any soldier; it could take years for the negative effects of this experience to be overcome. In that regard, the ending was much too much Hollywood Pollyannaism.<br /><br />If you can set aside your reason and just take the movie for what it is, it offers a fast paced, action packed movie that won't let you go; at 91 minutes it's relatively short and is over rather quickly. With the caveats mentioned above I can recommend this as an exciting action movie.</p></body></html>

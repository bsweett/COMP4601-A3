The largely polarized "loved it-hated it" reviews posted here prove once again that you either buy into Kaufman's somewhat myopic Woody Allen-on-crack worldview, or you don't. I will admit to being a bit of a fence-sitter in regards to Mr. Kaufman's work-I can appreciate his creativity and where he is coming from, but his films sometimes give me the uncomfortably creepy feeling that I am reading someone's private dream journal that was never intended for my prying eyes. Tom Wilkinson ("Full Monty", "In The Bedroom") keeps a straight face as the doctor-scientist running Lacuna, Inc., a clinic specializing in "erasing" unpleasant memories (love affairs and other mental traumas) from client's minds, sort of a "Total Recall" in reverse. Jim Carrey plays a lovelorn depressive who decides to go through the process after learning that his ex (a complete kook played by a decidedly unglamorous Kate Winslet) has had him erased from her memory. This silly, faux-sci-fi concept works mostly due to the earnest (albeit weird) performances from the cast. As unconventional as Kaufman's approach is, the movie surrenders to a somewhat predictable denoument that makes you feel like you've been led around the theater by your nose. Jim Carrey suffers a bit here from the Bill Murray Syndrome (wherein comic actors "play dead" when cast in a Serious Role-"Don't laugh at me-I'm ACTING!"). Worth a look for fans of the offbeat.</p></body></html>

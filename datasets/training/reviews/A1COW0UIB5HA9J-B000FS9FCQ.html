However, a mysterious masked avenger named V (Hugo Weaving) takes matters into his own hands as he becomes a rebel that fights against those that have disfigured him along time ago. A woman named Evey (Natalie Portman) befriends this mysterious anti-hero as she must know what he must fight against and could start a major revolution on the 5th of November.<br /><br />Co-starring Stephen Rhea and John Hurt, this powerful and startling sci-fi action drama is inspired by the brilliant DC/Vertigo graphic novel by David Lloyd of the same name. It's a thought provoking and action packed film is a visually stunning and very realistic look at futuristic society gone wrong but yet somehow someone would fight against it, the film is wonderfully written and co-produced by the Wachowski Brothers who brought us "The Matrix" trilogy and wonderfully directed by James McTeigue. The film is one of the smartest and coolest Sci-fi movies of the new century that also plays as a political statement, Hugo Weaving steals the show as the title hero in probably the best performance of his career since Agent Smith from "The Matrix" or Lord Elrond from "Lord of the Rings".<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD offers some good extras like theatrical trailer, easter egg, a behind the scenes look of the film, three featurettes, Soundtrack info and a Montage as this is a must see movie event as it could be the "Blade Runner" of the 2000's.</p></body></html>

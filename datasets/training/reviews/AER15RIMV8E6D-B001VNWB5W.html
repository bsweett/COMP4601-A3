There were some sweet bloody scenes, and some cool special effects, but the rest was very boring. When a superhero called The Comedian is killed, Doctor Manhattan, Rorschach, Silk Spectre II, and Night Owl II try to figure out why. Rorscach was my favorite character because of his attitude. I really didn't like the way the movie ended. I wouldn't recommend WATCHMEN!!!</p></body></html>

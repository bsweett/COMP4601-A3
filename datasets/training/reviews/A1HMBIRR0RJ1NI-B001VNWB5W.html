Though the new Batman films have approached the subject matter in the duality of comic book heroes as imperfect people, living a lie as the perfect hero, no film touches this subject matter as the bottomless black vortex that is, "Watchmen." It's characters so disillusioned with their selves & the world, that it's hard to tell many of them apart from the bad guys their supposed to be protecting the world from. It is also a commentary of the Vietnam era, & contemplates President Nixon role as a leader if he was still in office in 1985. It does not look at individual criminals, but the human race as a whole, that is so corrupt, it is destined to implode on it's self from the weight of it's own decadence. There is violent murder, rape, lies, greed, vigilantism, hate, sex, loneliness, mass destruction, & worse of all, hypocrisy, in spades in this film. There are moments of pure transcendence, as "Watchmen" becomes more than just a comic book hero film, but a film that speaks of absolutes, if man kind is to survive as a species.<br /><br />This film is a joy to look at, some of the most potently spectacular scenes I've ever seen in a film of this type, mostly with "Dr. Manhattan. The scene where he is killing the Vietcong by the dozens, as a glowing, giant, god of destruction is just jaw dropping, both in the beauty & imagination of the scene, & the terror it brings with it. A true metaphor of what the Vietcong most of thought about America, charging into their country with weapons of destruction. The scenes on Mars, are truly awe inspiring, as Dr. Manhattan prefers the lifeless planet to a planet filled with humans bent on their own genocide, & the destruction of earth it's self. Other scenes too, of a smaller, but just as tragic scope. Rorschach being told by his mother she wishes he would not of been born after having sex with a john. Rorschach biting the ear off a bully, was pure unadulterated viciousness. The scene where he finds the little girl in the wood burner, & the dogs chewing, fighting, over her leg, & his vengeance not only on the dogs, but her killer is absolutely brutal. The Comedian, killing the pregnant Vietnamese woman, who was carrying his baby. He then looked at Dr. Manhattan who was shocked, & told him, he could've of stopped him anytime, but didn't. Dr. Manhattan's self startling realization that this was true. The Comedian hired by his own country to kill it's President. Yes, this is a film with a message, a deeply dark message, a true message, that super heroes mean nothing in a world that is ran by greed & corruption, by man. That only man can save mankind, & no other force, earthly or not, can change that. This is "Watchmen."</p></body></html>

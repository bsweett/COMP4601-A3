This was the funniest and most intriguing murder non-mystery I've seen in a long long time.<br /><br />Here's a non-sequiter:  Who the hell is Shane Black? How does Amazon come up with the  name of the "star" to put under the title of the movie?  I don't know what movie they saw, but the one I saw starred Robert Downey, Jr, and Val Kilmar. This movie was sort of like a roller coaster.  It was full of funny and scarry ups and downs.  It really was very interesting.<br /><br />I loved how the director mixed humor with scariness.  It was a blast to watch.<br /><br />It could have had more bonus features, but I'm glad to see a commentary from Robert Downey, Jr and Val Kilmar.  Very nice.<br /><br />Great flick!<br /><br />Two thumbs up!<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!!!</p></body></html>

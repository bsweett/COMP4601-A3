Yes, I was uplifted, blah blah blah, but while I was watching the movie, I realized I was being manipulated, which bothered me. I'm used to needing to suspend disbelief when watching movies, but this one tosses belief right out the window from the first moment and never comes back to it. For all that I know that, however, it's an enjoyable enough movie.<br /><br />In case anyone actually managed to miss the plot of the 2008 Oscar winner for Best Picture, it involves a young man, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), who ends up on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.  As the host asks him questions, we see flashbacks to pieces of his life (amazingly, in chronological order!) that give him the answers. Boyle uses this to take us on a tour of Mumbai slum life, the state of gang warfare in India, a romantic subplot, and much much more.<br /><br />As long as you don't mind being herded into the pen like cattle, or don't notice, this is just about the perfect movie; it took home eight Oscars, and as I write this is sitting at #64 on IMDB's Top 250. Heady stuff indeed, but I still find myself unimpressed with the complete lack of subtlety to be found in the script. Granted, everyone involved did a bang-up job of bringing that script to life, but the script itself left a lot to be desired. It's shameless in everything it tries to do, but it garnered a whole lot of true believers, both behind and in front of the cameras. It had to, for the final product to be as technically fine as it is.<br /><br />Technically, a stunning achievement. Plotwise, not so much. See for yourself and judge. ***</p></body></html>

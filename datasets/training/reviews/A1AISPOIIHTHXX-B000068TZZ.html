Wanting to give films more recognition than they would've done otherwise, he helps get more attention to films by giving a "presented by..." credit such as on absolute pieces of...you know for Hostel and actually for a really good movie with Hero. But he did used to make movies once and his first one was the controversial Reservoir Dogs, which kind of exploded and made him the new face in directing. Will people love it as much as Pulp Fiction? Probably on the same level with Pulp edging it out but this is still a pretty good movie.<br /><br />6 guys, all given codenames: Mr. Blue, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange and Mr. White, are involved in a diamond heist but only it goes horribly wrong and they all go back to a warehouse and try to figure out why it went wrong and the possibility there's an undercover cop in their midst. Mixed in with this is flashbacks to not only some of the characters before the heist but during the heist itself, shooting their way out.<br /><br />Right from the on-set you can see what would become his trademark: long, drawn-out scenes of characters having normal day-type conversations with his witty dialogue. Some of it doesn't work (I still don't find the theory behind Madonna's "Like a Prayer" funny) but then in other cases, it's extremely funny. Another thing is that the film was criticized for being violent. Well it's actually not a very violent film despite guns firing and people getting hit. The violence comes from the way it portrayed, in a more realistic unflinching matter rather than over-the-top(in other words, this is not Kill Bill) that it seems more violent than it actually was.<br /><br />The casting is quite spot-on although to be honest, even though he passed recently, I never liked Chris Penn, even when he was acting but it's just a personal opinion. However everyone else, especially Harvey Kietel work perfectly. I'll also say Tim Roth does a good job but people might find his high-pitched squealing a little cumbersome. Does the film have any flaws besides the casting? Well, even though the warehouse and heist scenes are interesting, I never did like the pre-heist stuff, such as meeting Mr. Blonde and Mr. White or Mr. Orange telling a story in a bar. It's not like Pulp Fiction where each story was interesting in its own right, but here it almost felt like "get back to the warehouse".<br /><br />In probably one of the neatest packaging I've seen, the case comes in a gasoline can looking thing and the top comes out which reveals the 2 disc which are on the opposite site of a booklet that is shaped like a match book. But like the packaging for internet series Broken Saints, new packaging doesn't make good for practicality and people might find the case easily bendable or those horrible dents. The transfer's better, the extra features seem recycled and why do I get this nagging feeling there's going to be a 20th anniversary?<br /><br />There's a certain self-assurance that I love here. No nervous jittering since it was his first film, it's just go for broke filmmaking and it's all the better for it. While lately it seems his name is everywhere but not new movies, it's still good to see one of the 90's better movies.</p></body></html>

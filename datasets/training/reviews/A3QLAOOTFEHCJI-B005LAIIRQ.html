This is not a story about werewolves.  It is about survival in a part of the world unwelcome to man.  A group of oil workers on the Alaska pipeline are heading to Anchorage for a little R and R when the plane goes down in the frozen wilderness.  Miraculously 7 survive the crash.  Liam Neeson is fortunately one of the survivors.  He is a marksman employed by the company and is charged with keeping the workers safe from wolves.  He is suicidal because of the recent death of his wife.  These early scenes must have been difficult for Neeson given his own personal circumstances.  In any case, those memories of his wife sustain him as he attempts to lead the survivors to safety.  Attempt is the operative word here.  In addition to below freezing temperatures, blizzards and a lack of food and water, the group must also deal with a pack of wolves looking for dinner.<br /><br />Ottway (Neeson) knows wolves are cunning hunters and will pick off the men one by one if they let their guard down.  The movie is terribly moving at times as each of the men has their own skeletons in the closet or loved ones waiting to see them.  They are full of grit but a lack of weapons and adaptability to the elements puts them at great risk.  Yes there are confrontations both with the wolves and each other.  And yes, the wolves are vicious but in a realistic way.  Escapist material?  You bet, but don't look for a happy ending.  If you sit through the entire credit list at the end of the film, there is a very brief scene that may make you feel better.  See it!</p></body></html>

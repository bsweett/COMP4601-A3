This is a place where everybody tends to gather and has the atmosphere of excitement and familiarity. Rick owns this cafe with its separate gaming quarters. Humphrey plays this character, he owns his space with wit and flat affect, which seems common in his acting. He has been duped in love and is reserved and withholds emotion towards people in general. He finds out that a man who is quite respected in speaking out against the Nazis is coming to his establishment. What surprises him is who this man brings with him. It is the old flame who he loved and crumbled his defenses with her elegance and style. This is played by Bergman, Ilsa. She is married to the famous speaker and writer and Rick is taken aback. They are trying to escape to America. The things I liked about this film are the plush feel to the Cafe and the black and white eloquence of how it was filmed. The bazaar and exciting culture glimpsed with the set of Morroco. The dialog which is known by many, Heres Looking at you Kid and Play it again Sam. The words and how they are said. Bergman reminds me of Nicole Kidman. She is so feminine and respectable to me. I like the way she talks and how she comes across on film. The ending is different than the norm and you wonder if Ilsa was acting somewhat with Rick to save her husband. It seems like it wasn't acting she just was so strong in not running back to Rick on the last scene of their parting. He doesn't reflect his pain on her departure which is too bad, I think his emotional self could have been displayed a little more in this ending shot of his leaving with the constable, even though his character is quite guarded with armor. I liked the drives that Rick and Ilsa took in France, their leisure and intimate togetherness in cafes. Roulette is fun. This is in his small casino. Champagne and caviar, which is eaten on toast points and luscious bubbly swilled. An elegant film all in all.</p></body></html>

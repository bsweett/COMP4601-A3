<meta name="summary" content="The most powerful story to finally come out of Hollywood"></head><body><p>Like Dracula, World War II is probably one of the most filmed eras. You have Oskar Schindler's saving the Jews in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List, the bombing of Pearl Harbor in Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor, and the Invasion of Normandy in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Here, Roman Polanski directs a story that takes place throughout World War II through the eyes of a Polish man and his love for the piano. <p>The story begins as Wladyslaw Spilzman, a pianist is living through augmenting worse conditions. He then is forced to hide through the ruins of Warsaw, until his rescue from the ruins by a kind hearted German officer. Through dealing with famine, tragedy and death, he manages to get through it by his wanting to play the piano, even in his mind. In one scene, he imagines playing the piano notes in his head without actually playing for fear of Germans overhearing.<p>In today's era of overblown movies without substance like Legally Blonde or really expensive but good films like Matrix Reloaded, it's about time a film came out of Hollywood with a gripping story and human characters, rather than a big green Shrek reject.</p></body></html>

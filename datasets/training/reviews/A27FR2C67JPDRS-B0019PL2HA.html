<meta name="summary" content="Ferell and crew SHAKE and BAKE with this film!!!"></head><body><p>I'm a southern guy and I pretty much hate everything to do with NASCAR, which in this part of the country makes me a freak of nature!  So when I heard about this movie, I dismissed it.  Then I saw the trailer for the film and couldn't stop laughing. Only Will Ferrell could take one of the most boring sports in the world and turn it into a laugh riot!<br /><br />Ricky Bobby is the risk-taking star of the NASCAR circuit.  He has it all----his childhood friend, Cal, is also a driver; he has a beautiful (and white trash turned rich) wife; two sons (Walker and Texas Ranger) and a HUGE fortune.  Enter Jean Girard, a gay Frenchman who is determined to knock Ricky Bobby from the number one spot and, suddenly, the popular Nascar driver's life is changed.  During a traumatic crash while racing with Girard, Ricky loses his mojo and must find his way back to first place! The scene with him running in his underwear, convinced he is on fire and praying to Tom Cruise and Oprah is priceless! (I'm not giving anything away because you see this in the preview)  He loses everything that is important to him and must fight his way back to Talladega and reclaim his need for speed!<br /><br />Will Ferrell nails the role of Ricky Bobby and this is, by far, my favorite Ferrell film.  Sacha Baron Cohen nearly steals the show as the gay driver whose crush on Ricky is not so secret.  And from a short but great cameo role by SNL alum, Molly Shannon as a alcohol swilling sponsor's wife, to Andy Richter as Girard's dog training husband, the film sports a great cast and supporting cast that keep the laughs coming.  John C. Reilly, a terrific actor, is a gem in this movie!  One can only hope that we see him in more comedies in the coming years.  And Gary Cole is hilarious as Reese Bobby, Ricky's no good dad who show's up in Ricky's life about every ten years and has a hand in his return to the track---albeit by some unconventional methods!  There are tons of other star cameos, from actual NASCAR drivers to Elvis Costello and Mos Def!<br /><br />Take some good friends and just sit back and share some laughs!  And stay for the credits for some funny outtakes from the film.  I believe NASCAR fans and non-NASCAR fans will enjoy this comedy.  Some people may be put off by the gay kiss scene (hilarious and with more lip lockage than a scene from Brokeback Mountain) but they should get over it and just laugh along with the rest of us.  The one (and probably only) dvd I'll add to my collection with any relation to NASCAR!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hooray for Captain Spaulding!  And for Writer/Director Rob Zombie, too!"></head><body><p>With 2003's HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES, neophyte writer/director Rob Zombie attempted to create a horror film that hearkened back to the grind-house horror films of the 1970s, films like THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974) and THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972).  He was successful, to a degree at least, in that aesthetically and stylistically the film does, indeed, have a distinct 1970s "feel."  But in most other respects, the film falters.  Most obviously, the plot is derivative and therefore stale, and some of the characters are so outrageously drawn (and performed) that they become mere caricatures of those they are intended to pay homage to.<br /><br />In his sequel THE DEVIL'S REJECTS (2005), however, it is apparent that auteur Zombie has learned from his previous mistakes.  To be sure, the same 1970s-era grind-house aesthetic is there--grainy-looking film stock, filthy sets and locales, disturbing characters, and Grand Guignol gore and violence are all stylistically central.  But Zombie has raised the overall quality several notches above the previous flick with a plot that is fresh, multi-faceted, and well paced, and his characters--even the returning ones--are drastically more complex and three-dimensional.  Also, Zombie's directorial style is more confident and more fluid.  He's not reluctant to utilize new camera techniques, editing tactics, and modern digital technology, though he does so in such a way that enhances but never detracts from the classic visual "feel" that he seeks to evoke.  (For example, nearly one hundred digital FX appear in the film, mostly within scenes of violence involving objects that come into direct contact with bare skin. Such realistic-looking imagery would've been nearly impossible to create in the era of the films to which Zombie is paying homage.)<br /><br />The performances that Zombie draws from his actors in THE DEVIL'S REJECTS are uniformly outstanding, this in spite of the fact that the central characters are carryovers from the lesser HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES.  Obviously more confident as a director, he gets the returning actors to ratchet down their performances and deliver a level of realism that is more affecting, and in turn more frightening, than before.  Portraying the charismatic murderer and necrophiliac Otis Driftwood, actor Bill Moseley almost seems to be psychically channeling 1960's sociopathic killer Charles Manson.  Sid Haig's surrealistic reprisal of killer clown Captain Spaulding is a coulrophobe's worst nightmare, and Sheri Moon Zombie's portrayal of the flirtatious but psychopathic Baby Firefly chills to the bone.  Also notable is William Forsythe, who portrays new character Sheriff Wydell.  In a role that could have easily digressed into cliche or parody, Forsythe plays it intense and believable, even when his character crosses the line and becomes morally indistinguishable from the homicidal titular trio.<br /><br />Lions Gate's 2-disc director's-cut DVD edition of THE DEVIL'S REJECTS is well worth the price of admission.  Not only does it feature a beautiful digital transfer of Rob Zombie's unrated director's cut in the film's theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for widescreen TVs), it is also chock-full of cool bonus features.  There are two feature commentaries--one with Zombie and another with the principal cast--as well as deleted scenes, outtakes, two complete Captain Spaulding TV commercials, and a documentary on the making of the film.<br /><br />In short, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS is an excellent second effort from writer/director Rob Zombie that just may well go down in cinematic history as his magnum opus.  True, it may not suit everyone's taste, but for fans of Grand Guignol cinema and 1970s grind-house flicks, this film is a must-own.</p></body></html>

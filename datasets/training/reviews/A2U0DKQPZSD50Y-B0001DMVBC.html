<meta name="summary" content="an interesting movie"></head><body><p>this movie was very interesting and it makes you feel bad for the Iranian family who worked hard and di nothing wrong only to have their lives ruined by a woman to depressed to open the male and her crazy cop boyfriend. A lot of people feel sorry for the woman but I can't see how this movie can really allow them to feel bad for her all of her downfalls were due to her actions and she continues to make mistakes not caring who they may hurt. This story does really make you feel bad for the stories true heros the Iranian family</p></body></html>

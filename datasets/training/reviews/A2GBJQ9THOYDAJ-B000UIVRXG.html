He's transferred to the supposedly quiet village of Sandford, Gloucestershire as punishment for his success -- where, of course, he stumbles onto a series of murders made to look like accidents and can't get the local constabulary to take him seriously. But everything changes when he puts on the dark glasses and puts the hammer down. From there, it's an unbelievable mix of shoot-outs, car chases, slo-mo action, and numerous similar homages to the films of John Woo and others. It's unusual for a film to be successful as both a high-octane action flick AND a dryly hilarious comedy, but this one manages it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Amityville Horror (Widescreen Special Edition)"></head><body><p>The Amityville Horror (Widescreen Special Edition)~ Ryan Reynolds is a good horror movie re-make of the 1979 with James Brolin. The special effects are much better, and the acting is a bit better. One can sense that this movie has been heavily influenced by works such as The Ring and sometimes they do borrow a bit too heavily. I also feel that "Jodey" is not properly explained and I feel that part of the movie could have been longer. I also feel that it jumps way to much and that the movie could have been like an hour longer to fully explain the ongoing process instead of this fastforwarding at times. It truly feels as if the director was a bit too pressed for time. I would love to see yet another remake or series where they allow you to follow the plot a bit more closely. Even so it is a fine movie that could have been a bit better but still is watchable and gets three stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A literary gem adapted into a masterpiece of a film.  Fantastic!"></head><body><p>Several years ago I read this book.  Loved it!<br /><br />I never thought it would adapt well to the screen though.  It seemed  too dreamy with too many scenes that might or just might not have happened.  I was wrong.  This film is as much a masterpiece as the book and was nominated for several Academy awards.  Perhaps it's because Ian McEwan, the author, who I consider to be a literary genius, had a role in adapting his book to the screen.  Perhaps it's because the details of the setting are so scrupulously adhered to.  And perhaps it's because the acting throughout is just so darn good.  Put together this film is an absolute gem.<br /><br />The film opens in an upscale house in the English countryside in 1935.  It seems an idyllic life, especially through the eyes of 13-year old Briony Tallis who is writing a play to be performed by her young cousins for the entertainment of her family.  Her older sister, Cecilia, is in love with Robbie, the son of the cook, who has been provided an education by her father and loves Cecilia in return.  But trouble ensues because of a misunderstanding based on the young Briony's active imagination.<br /><br />Fast forward to 1940.  England is now at War, Robbie has spent five years in jail and is now in the British army.  He and Cecilia are still in love and Briony is eighteen years old and a nurse in a British hospital.  The war is awful.  We see Robbie experiencing its horrors.  He is wounded and suffering as he waits nine days for evacuation from the beaches of Dunkirk.  At this time, Briony has a change of heart, realizes that she has caused pain to her family because of her earlier lies, and seeks out her sister who she hasn't seen for the past few years.<br /><br />It is only later, after a lifetime, that we find out that this visit to her sister is not quite what it seemed.  This occurs when the elderly Briony gives up the secrets that bind this story together.  Wow!  What an impact!<br /><br />The setting and cinematography are exceptional and the acting is outstanding.  Kiera Knightly is cast as Cecilia and James Turner as Robbie. Briony is played by three different actors at different ages - Saaorise Ronan at 13, Ramola Garai at 18, and Vanessa Regrave as a the elderly woman.<br /><br />This is a fine, complex and nuanced film.  A sophisticated audience will love it.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

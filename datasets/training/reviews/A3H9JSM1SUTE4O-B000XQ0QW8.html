<meta name="summary" content="&quot;I SEE COMIC BOOK HEROES&quot;"></head><body><p>After M. Night Shyamalan's huge hit &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; he could do anything he wanted.  What he chose was an earlier story idea he had that is essentially a reworking of basic plot elements of his previous smash.  <p>&quot;UNBREAKABLE&quot; springs from a flimsy premise about comic book heroes existing in real life.  It's a dark, grim, but sometimes absorbing metaphysical mystery about an ordinary blue collar guy, Bruce Willis again, who encounters himself and his nemesis (Samuel L. Jackson) as he attempts to restore his troubled marriage and maintain a bond with his sometimes nutty kid (who wants to shoot him to see if he's really an &quot;unbreakable&quot; superhero).  <p>The sumptuous two disc set includes an unusually muted widescreen transfer with a rich but repetitive sound design.  A ton of extras including &quot;Comic Books and Superheroes&quot; with Jackson.  Nice fold-out packaging but disappointing content.  Rent before you buy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very good movie with great characters"></head><body><p>Matchstick Men is a very enjoyable movie with excellent characters and an even better story.  The story is about Roy, a obsessive compulsive small time conman.  Working with his partner Frank, they pull small scams on unsuspecting homeowners.  Everything in Roy's life is turned upside down when he meets his 14 year old daughter for the first time.  Also, he decides to go back to a big time scam on an acquaintance of Frank's.  At some point, Roy realizes he bonds with his daughter best when he is teaching her the tricks of the trade.  This is a great movie that has its funny and serious parts meshing them both together.  Hans Zimmer gives an excellent musical score reminiscent of Two Mules for Sister Sara as well as some Sinatra songs.  While the twist ending may disappoint a little, the movie is still very enjoyable and well worth a watch.<p>  Nicolas Cage gives an excellent performance as the obsessive compulsive con man Roy.  He twitches throughout the movie as we learn some of the things that send him on a spree.  Sam Rockwell is also very good as Roy's partner, Frank, who is really his only friend.  Alison Lohman plays Roy's daughter, Angela, while Bruce Altman is Roy's pyschiatrist.  The relationships between all these characters is very believable and the overall high point of the movie.  Bruce McGill also stars as the man Roy and Frank are targeting for their con.  Matchstick Men is a very enjoyable movie that at times will have you laughing and other times feeling other emotions for the characters.  Either way, this movie is well worth going to see!</p></body></html>

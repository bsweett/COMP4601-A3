How could this be? As a huge follower of the science fiction, and in particular, alien, genre, I am constantly looking for new and re-released media that focuses on those subjects, and this remake seemed like a perfectly noble idea (especially since no one in our current generation seems to have watched the original).<br /><br />The first thirty minutes of the film are undoubtedly the best. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as always, and the initial contact between alien spacecraft and civilians is beautifully captured. Keanu Reeves 'mind controlling' his questioner was intriguing as well, and everything seems to follow a dark, stark directorial style, until the director seems to suddenly lose it and gets all emotional. You will seriously not believe that a film that starts with such promise could dissolve into such blissfully idiotic stupidity.<br /><br />Thats when this film becomes half of what it could have been. In between touching 'familial' scenes and endless mother-son hugs, and Jennifer's plea to the Alien to 'give us earthlings another chance to prove us wrong', everything towards the end feels rushed and does not make any sense. The basic premise being that the Alien was sent to warn mankind that since Earthlings are doing such a horrible job of looking after Earth, Aliens would soon colonize the planet. But then Jennifer manages to convince the alien that human beings are full of love and compassion and as cuddly as koala bears, and he believes her (not a very intelligent alien, is my guess).<br /><br />The climax, if you can call it that, is laughable. The alien (played by Reeves), rushes towards his spaceship and 'takes off' (even this is not shown properly). Thats it. He leaves. I couldn't believe this was the end to this movie. It isn't just disappointing, its insulting, especially because it actually started off like a serious commentary on interplanetary relations. And then they ruined it. The filmmakers should really be ashamed of what they've done here, and how they have absolutely belittled the source material.<br /><br />Three Stars.<br /><br />Also, Keanu Reeves playing a dull, emotionless alien was no stretch at all. He basically shows up playing himself. This wasn't even like an 'inside joke'. It was mostly just plain bad casting. The only character worth liking in this film was the Gigantic Protector 'Gort', who displays enormous character, fortitude and devotion to his cause, despite the fact that he wears a mask and doesn't display his emotions easily.<br /><br />For a better film on alien invasions, try watching "Body Snatchers" from the early 1990s (starring Gabrielle Anwar) and "The Invasion" from 2007 (starring Nicole Kidman). Also, getting the only series of "Invasion" (TV show starring Eddie Cibrian) isn't such a bad idea, considering its the best alien invasion show ever created.</p></body></html>

I didn't enjoy the film quite as much as I thought I would, but I still recommend it.<br /><br />Here's the basic plot of the film: Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) has been running a small Italian restaurant in south Philadelphia for about ten years. His beloved wife Adrian (Talia Shire, who appears only in flashbacks of the other five "Rocky" movies) died of cancer three years ago. Rocky has been unable to let go of her, and the first 45 minutes of the movie basically outline the tremendous amount of grief he is feeling. In a way, Rocky is also grieving for his son (Milo Ventimiglia). Now a grown man, Rocky Jr. is unhappy with his job and has tried to distance himself from his father.<br /><br />Rocky ultimately decides that he wants to try his hand at boxing again. He manages to acquire a license and plans to concentrate on small local fights. However, the current heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver), becomes rattled after a televised computer matchup between him and Rocky deems Rocky as the winner. Mason invites Rocky to participate in an exhibition match, and Rocky accepts the offer.<br /><br />Rocky's training doesn't go as smoothly as it did before: he's pushing 60 now and has to deal with arthritis, calcium deposits, and a variety of other ailments. As always, though, Rocky perseveres, and he gets a lot of help from his son and from good old Paulie (Burt Young). The film culminates in a Pay-Per-View matchup between Rocky and Mason in Las Vegas, which is as intense and emotional as every other fight we've seen in the series.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending for everyone, but I think the result of the fight was entirely appropriate. Once again, Rocky shows us the importance of fighting hard to keep our dreams alive, despite any obstacles that come our way. The film is very reminiscent of the first "Rocky" movie, and I really enjoyed that. There are also many flashbacks from the previous five films, and those old clips were a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />Even though I liked the movie, there were a few things I didn't care for. As I mentioned before, the first 45 minutes of the movie were incredibly depressing. Stallone obviously wanted us to focus on Rocky's character more than just the fighting itself, and I get that, but still...it was too darn depressing! Also, Rocky's friendship with Marie (Geraldine Hughes) was interesting at first because of the way she actually knows Rocky from years back, but I think the movie focused too much on their relationship. Marie did not have to be such a prominent fixture in the film. Finally, I didn't like the way most of the fight was filmed. It looked like we were watching an actual Pay-Per- View fight, which seemed very out of place with the rest of the movie's style. Stallone switched to using "regular" camera angles again at the very end of the fight, but I don't understand why he went with the whole HBO sports film sequence for so long.<br /><br />Overall, I think Rocky fans will really enjoy this movie. It's very bittersweet, but it was nice to have a solid conclusion to the series. (And ANYTHING would have been better than "Rocky V!")</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ah, family.....you love them but want to kill them sometimes"></head><body><p>Nia Vardalos' heartwarming story of her courtship and wedding provides great entertainment as well as evoking memories all of us can relate to.....however much we love our family, they can be so embarrassing at times! Still, The Ties That Bind are the core of this film, from the proud but possessive parents to the my-relatives-as-bridesmaids-make-me-crazy and the in-laws who are thrown into the unfamiliar waters of Greek culture but gamely manage to swim. Highly recommend this funny and charming romantic comedy</p></body></html>

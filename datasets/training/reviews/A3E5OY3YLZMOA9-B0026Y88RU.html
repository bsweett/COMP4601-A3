I'm pretty sure that I just didn't take it seriously. The preview portrays it too much in a comedic genre. What it really is a smooth assassin film with some comedy. The film starts out in a terminal with a man just sitting and waiting until an old man in a wheelchair (Bruce Willis) appears out of nowhere. The old man looks harmless of course and starts telling the guy about the story of a Kansas City Shuffle.<br /><br />The story is based in 1979 and is about a fixed horse race and how everything goes wrong and people end up getting hurt. The purpose of the shuffle is actually to make someone look in another direction. What Willis does after he tells this Kansas City Shuffle tale well you'll have to watch and see. After this a man in present day named Sleven (Josh Hartnett) is introduced. He came to town to meet his friend but before he gets there some bad things happen to him. First he gets kicked out of his apartment, he catches his girlfriend cheating on him, and then he gets mugged.<br /><br />He didn't have a rough week he had a rough day and so much more is coming for him. After he arrives a cute but annoying neighbor (Lucy Liu) greets him. She just won't leave him alone or stop asking him questions. While sitting in his friend's apartment in a towel someone knocks on the door. It's two guys coming to get him and take him to The Boss (Morgan Freeman) who is well the boss of a mob. The Boss informs him that he can't find his friend and because of this he owes him money. After Slevin is dropped off not too much later two men knock to take him to The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley). The Rabbi is well a Rabbi who also happens to be a boss of a mob.<br /><br />What may be one of the longest synopsis ever or a least that I've ever had to write this film is definitely worth it. All that and that's only half of the movies story. So many things happen in this film that make it a bit predictable but exciting. The story was done nicely from the pace to the order of the events. It starts out sort of cool with Bruce Willis in the opening scene but then it goes into a bit of comedy. So already you don't really know what to expect from it. Then Lucy Liu is thrown into it and I'm thinking it might go more towards a comedy cause her character was wacky.<br /><br />I was surprised because the twists were woven in perfectly. Lucy didn't mess with it at all and Hartnett did a nice job. Bruce Willis made the film, well him, Morgan, and Ben. I love the back-story, which was very original. The action or gunplay was just enough to give the movie a bit of a grimy feeling to it. Though this movie is predictable or at least some people will get it quickly I like how it was done. It makes you believe one thing never totally letting go of its seriousness and then they go a little deeper. This had a great cast, it was well written, and I would recommend this to anyone who just wants to see a good film.</p></body></html>

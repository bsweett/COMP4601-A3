<meta name="summary" content="Great!!!"></head><body><p>I have wanted to see the movie and got to see it this past Memorial Day weekend; Will is just as charming and fine as he can be; Eve Mendes is a great breath of fresh air; Kevin James; well, he played his role to the hilt; Kind of stole the darn show if you asked me; Will is smooth as a date doctor hooking up otherwise average men with the woman of their dreams;And oh, is he good; But when he gets with Eve, oh boy, he forgets the rules, and when somehow, Eve's character finds out that this date doctor had somehow caused her best friend pain, it goes from bad to worse; I plan to get this on DVD no doubt; I love romantic comedies; My favorite part: Will Smith dangling keys at Kevin James for a practice kiss; Classic. Another favorite part, Will taking Eve to Ellis Island and finding out about her relative who first come to America and all; Smooth; real smooth. but when his shirt gets caught in the cab door, another classic moment indeed;</p></body></html>

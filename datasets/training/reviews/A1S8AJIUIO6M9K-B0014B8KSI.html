<meta name="summary" content="Superb on Multiple Levels, Closes Beautifully"></head><body><p>There are some really fine reviews.  I will just say I consider this a five star film, not the average of four as shown.  It was so very good that I paused it each time I had to get up for anything, and then watched the last four segments again this morning to ensure I had not missed anything.<br /><br />At three different levels, a small boy and his dad talking about a fictional empire, at the street level, and at the strategic level of big law firms, I found this film extremely engaging and worthy.<br /><br />For the first time I can remember, I actually read all of the closing credits because the producers had the brilliant idea of having Clooney take a taxi ride while his face did this whole range of reflective expressions that kept me glued to the screen.<br /><br />Here, in priority order, are ten other DVDs I recommend--the first, Fight Club, is not at all what you would expect from the title, and I only watched it on my teen-ager's recommendation.  He was right, it's a DVD for intelligent people.  All these I list I own and recommend for purchase, not just rental.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067J1H">Fight Club (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M341QE">The Departed (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VNMMR0">Live Free or Die Hard (Unrated Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OVLBGC">The Lives of Others</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00011CZRE">Seven (Single Disc Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8DV1M">Firewall (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783227973">Primary Colors</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BYA5G4">Lord of War (Widescreen)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006BSBW">Pulp Fiction</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNJV">Batman Begins (Widescreen Edition)</a></p></body></html>

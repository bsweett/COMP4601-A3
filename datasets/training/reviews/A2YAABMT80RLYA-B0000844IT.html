<meta name="summary" content="Another re-relase. This should have been the one and only."></head><body><p>I think &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; takes the cake for having been re-released on DVD so many times. I believe that this is the 4th edition, and is so far the best. Why they couldn't have released this edition in the first place, I'll never know, but it would have definitely save me some pocket change.<p>The &quot;Boomstick&quot; edition is more or less a compiling of both versions of the film, the US Theatrical Version and the Director's Edition. Here are the differences:<p>Theatrical Version: This is the one I prefer, because it is more of a comedy that a horror movie. It is the version everybody saw first, and it has all the classic moments from the VHS and initial DVD release. <p>Director's Version: This is the same as the &quot;Official Bootleg Cut&quot; that came out last year. It boasts 15 minutes of never-before-seen footage, but it comes at the expence of other scenes that were cut out. Gone are many of the good battle scenes, much of the comedy, different dialogue and music, and a different ending that is lousy. Overall, this version is different, more of a standard horror movie. I always believe there is merit in what the director intended, but this is one of those cases where the alternate version was the better one. <p>The behind-the-scenes featurette presented by Bruce Campbell is excellent, as always. I always love his commentaries and his voice overs, he is always insightful and can always laugh at himself. As good as the extras are, though, it doesn't make the package. If you already own the Theatrical Version and the Director's &quot;Bootleg&quot; Edition, I wouldn't bother with this one. That is unless you have too much money burning a hole in your pocket.</p></body></html>

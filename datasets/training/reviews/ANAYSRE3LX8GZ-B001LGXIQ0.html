<meta name="summary" content="Missed it by a whole lot more then this____ much"></head><body><p>Over the last few years with internet and chat developments, I have met many American people and discussed classic TV thousands of times... the one topic I was always surprised at was how many Americans I had talked to who had not heard of "Get Smart"...would you believe it?<br /><br />Logging into Amazon right now to see how many 5 and 4 star votes this movie has gotten, I can only come to terms that they are the ones who have no idea that this movie is based on a classic 1960's TV show. If they had have seen the original Mel Brooks creation starring Don Adams as Maxwell Smart: Secret Agent 86 (Also the voice of Inspector Gadget) and Barbra Feldon as 99, as well as all the terrific supporting roles by so many other great actors, then they would see that this movie does not hold a flame to the original series, and is almost a complete embarrassment to it.<br /><br />The 40 Year Old Virgin playing Maxwell does not portray the character of Max well. Maxwell should be sophisticated, charming, a smooth talker when he wants to be while also being a bit goofy, a stumbling klutz, and almost cartoon-like in certain ways. Steve portrays him as a geeky loser who can not produce the timing needed to pull off the classic quotes.<br /><br />Whoever is playing 99 was about the only one I think did any research on her character. She sounded a little like Barbra Feldon, and looked a little like her in ways, but she did not act like 99. She needed to lose the bitchyness and self involvement.<br /><br />The chemistry between those two characters was not there. First they hate each other, then all of a sudden Max breaks wind and she finds him charming, and suddenly they're an item? For starters, the original 99 and 86 would never insult each other, it felt too uncomfortable to see these two fighting and arguing and trying to out do each other for a better part of the movie. I know they trying to update this thing to tell the story in a modern day way, but there are some things that do not work with these well known and classic characters.<br /><br />Whoever played Siegfried almost looked the part at first, and at first I thought this evil sinister approach might be a good idea... but when he delivers a classic Siegfried line... he says it in a way that is just not humorous. Maybe they where going for it, but I think it failed.<br /><br />The Rock, Dwayne Johnson is in here as agent 23, big deal, he seemed to add little to nothing being in this movie.<br /><br />Larrabee as a bully? wt???? The Chief did not seem to be a good casting choice, the two poor attempts at geeky side-liners needed to go, and don't forget the stale as hell jokes of the fat person comedy relief gags... oh yeah, the sudden hit by a bus thing... we've seen that 1000 times already and it wasn't funny the first time. Are Hollyweed writers still on strike or something?<br /><br />What this movie needed badly was Mel Brooks. Why wasn't he asked to make this film? Go over the script, add something, just SOMETHING to this movie to improve it and make it feel like something new, with that old familiar feeling to it? Least Mel would have gotten some kind of laugh from the pathetic attempt they had at an updated "cone of silence" gag.<br /><br />On the comedy scale, I did not laugh as much as I hoped. I had a few chuckles, but nothing that I would say was hilarious or genius. And the worst part about it is, no matter how well this movie does, you can tell they have already written a sequel.. hell, there is even already a spin off available on DVD of the two geeks, and this movie isn't even on DVD yet.... gimme a break... there is no way anyone will remember the spin off to this in 2 years time.<br /><br />I have talked about all the cons so far, so can I say anything nice about the movie? A couple of things; It was good to see the original Siegfried (Bernie Kopell) get a cameo appearance in a decently thought of idea to pay homage to the original Get Smart series vehicles. Interesting to see Bill Murray trying to be funny again, and err... if I happen to think of anything else, I'll get back to you.<br /><br />Overall: Barely got to being an average movie. It's pretty much what you expect from a classic TV show to a movie, all looks, and more concern with setting up a sequel then to make a movie both old & new fans will enjoy.</p></body></html>

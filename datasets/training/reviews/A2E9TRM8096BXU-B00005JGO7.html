Both have a flashy, gimmicky, rock-video style, Martin-Scorsese-after too much espresso camera tricks and machine-gun editing that often leaves you as dazed as if Muhammad Ali just let you have it with a six-punch combination to the head. They also point out the British fixation on Quentin Tarantino and how both films seem to ape that combination of quirky dialogue, humorously bloody violence, and out-of-sync storytelling that seems to make no sense until the very end, when everything ties up.<p>These criticisms are all accurate and they are also the reason why most critics are fools. They just can't enjoy a movie for its own sake. You could make a number of 'legitimate' criticisms of "Snatch" -- but why waste your time? This movie absolutely rocks. Everything about it from the cast to the dialogue to the soundtrack fits as perfectly as the well-oiled parts of a brand-new pistol. Not a replica pistol either -- a Desert Eagle .50, to be exact. <p>I'll skip the plot. Other reviewers nailed it. It revolves simultaneously around a stolen diamond and a bare-knuckles boxing match, but the plot is really just a vehicle for A) mayhem and B) Ritchie's terrific cast of characters to do their thing. I am here to tell you they did it. Tip....top.<p>Jason Statham is spot-on as Turkish, the gruff and unflappable boxing promoter whose withering, double-barreled sarcasm is a far more effective weapon than any gun. Dennis Farina and Vinny Jones are also excellent as a vitriolic diamond dealer named Avi and his sword-wielding, Jaguar-driving, Guinness-drinking thug-for-hire named Bullet Tooth Tony, respectively. Alan Ford gives an Oscar-caliber performance (or what would be an Oscar-caliber performance, if the Oscars ever went to the right bloke)as Brick Top, a local crime lord who wallows in his own villainy like the Lanastershire pigs he keeps to eat the bodies of his numerous victims. But the brass ring goes to Brad Pitt as the Irish gypsy Mickey O'Neil, an unwashed bare-knuckle boxing champ who speaks largely incomprehensible gibberish and comes off as a punch-drunk<br />half-wit, but ends up being the smartest guy in the film. Actually everybody in the cast delivers the goods and then some, but my Tam O'Shanter is especially off to Pitt, who destroys any remnants of the pretty-boy image that might have survived "Fight Club."<br /><br />The dialogue just crackles. Americans may be defeated by some of the slang, but for the most part Ritchie's characters achieve the very impressive goal of both spitting out tremendously funny, profanity-laden dialogue and always staying in character, something that Tarantino's bad guys never seem capable of doing. Nor is this movie hamstrung by the long, boring, listen-to-my dialogue-isn't-it-quirky-and-original intervals that plagued "Pulp Fiction." But comparisons between the two are largely facile. "Snatch" is not a better-faster-more version of any other movie: it is its own crazy, crooked, wild ride. But who cares anyway? Another Commonwealth boy, Angus Young, once said about AC/DC's music: "People always say, 'Those blokes made another album and it sounds just like the last one.' Well, give me more of the same, any time."</p></body></html>

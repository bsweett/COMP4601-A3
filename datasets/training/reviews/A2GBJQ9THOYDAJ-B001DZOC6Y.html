<meta name="summary" content="I give it about a 5 out of 10"></head><body><p>This is one of the spookiest films I've seen in recent years. A breeze comes up in Central Park, . . . and suddenly, people are walking off tall buildings, shooting themselves in the street, driving their cars into trees. Is it terrorists? No, actually, it appears to be a plot by trees and grass to rid the world of those pesky humans. Mark Wahlberg plays Elliot, a high school science teacher, who heads out of town with his wife (Zooey Deschanel) and the young daughter of his best friend, looking for a lightly inhabited area to hide out. (The plant plot initially affects large congregations of people, but it's working its way down to smaller and smaller groups.) There's a certain amount of confusion in the script, and I sort of expected a big "THE END?" in the last scene, but I'm going to be generous and assume Shyamalan was doing a homage to `50s science fiction film. SIXTH SENSE was terrific but SIGNS big time; this one is somewhere inbetween. The scary part comes mostly from the fact that there's no way you can protect yourself from the breeze, but there's some ironic humor, too: "It's plastic. I'm talking to a plastic tree. [pause] I'm still doing it." Not bad.</p></body></html>

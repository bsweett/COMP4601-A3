<meta name="summary" content="I've never seen a movie like this before"></head><body><p>"Juno" grabs you from the start,walking down the street drinking a gallon of Sunny D.Ellen  Page is so cool,thats the only word I can think of.I've know people in my life somewhat like her who just say whats on there mind.I wish I could have been like that.<br />Michael Cera has become such a huge star,I never thought after seeing him on "Arrested Development"I would hear from him again,even though I was a fan of the show,and its great to have Jason Bateman also in the movie who does a great job .{I also think the music from the film is so cool and different}<br />The ending is a big suprise.I thought I figured it out,but I didn't.<br />"Juno" is a film  everyone will enjoy.</p></body></html>

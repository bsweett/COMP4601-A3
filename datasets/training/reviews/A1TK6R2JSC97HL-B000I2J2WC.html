<meta name="summary" content="The biggest secret of all: a cure for insomnia."></head><body><p>Tom Hanks is Robert Langdon, the walking bibliophile of ancient codes and symbols, who is implicated in the murder of one of the Louvre's curators, a man who himself is something of a mystery.  Brought to the scene of the crime without being told that he's a suspect, Langdon is shocked to find the body positioned according to Da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man", and more shocked to learn that the victim assumed this position himself before dying - a sort of final coded message between two men with a love for codes.  Warned of the suspicions surrounding him by Sophie Neveau (Audrey Tatou), the dead man's granddaughter, Langdon escapes and leads the police in a chase across France in a desperate gamble to learn the victim's last, greatest secret.  Soon, Langdon's pursuers come to include a homicidal monk dispatched by a Bishop of the reactionary order of Opus Dei, and all events are shown to have been manipulated by a mysterious character known as "Teacher".  As Langdon picks up clues, he begins to realize that the mystery may involve the legend of the "Holy Grail", and heads for the home of an old friend, Sir Lee Teabing, the foremost proponent of a particularly unique theory of Grail legend.<br /><br />Even giving the movie the same allowances as the book, DVC is a horrible movie, slow, pedantic and full of red herrings that no sane moviegoer will fall for.  The religious controversy surrounding DVC thinly masks the movie's two cardinal flaws - 1) that it takes itself way more seriously than it deserves (the world is full of distinct religions espousing wholly incompatible beliefs - are we to believe that an admittedly dramatic discovery on one of them will really change the rest of the world?  Also, assuming the secret was uncovered, DVC never clears up how it would be proven); 2) it's boring!  At over two hours (and boy, will you feel it!) the only secret uncovered is that it's possible to have both Ian McKellan and Tom Hanks in a movie lacking almost any energy.  Hanks is serviceable as Langdon, Dan Brown's factotum of symbols nobody really cares about.  KcKellen chews up the scenery as Teabing, but ultimately the pointlessness of his character overwhelms McKellen's presence - whether you buy into his theories or not depends largely on the same degree of faith as the religion that Teabing assails.  The flick telegraphs its thrills - my wife and I were able to guess what would happen next, who would say what, etc...  The novel excelled because skillful pacing kept the action from being overwhelmed by the hot air of its long theories.<br /><br />The film plays down the novel's attacks on the Church for a more sustained atmosphere of religious antipathy (from disfavored apostles to Isaac Newton, if you've got a mind of your own, the Church hates and fears you, a bit of low-grade demagoguery that the script takes for granted).  To add insult to injury, DVC treats the Church as irrelevant (despite their wealth and power, the clergy in DVC are relegated to being unwitting pawns of a higher, if more temporal power).  But as I said, the story's attack on religion is itself a smokescreen hiding the fact that DVC is simply inert.</p></body></html>

The actors seemed to have a really good time doing this movie, too. The story is about a group of middle-aged weekend bikers from the 'burbs who feel the itch for adventure. Impulsively, they decide to go on a road trip on their bikes with no plan. Hilarity ensues when each bumbling character faces a challenge that addresses each of their fears, especially when they meet a rough biker gang in New Mexico headed by ultimate biker (Ray Liotta).<br /><br />The movie is lengthy but you will allow it if you are just in the mood for laughs. The laughs come especially if you are able to relate to the characters' situations. Tim Allen plays Doug Madsen, reportedly a daredevil in his teens but grows up to become a dentist who has played it safe ever since he got married with kids. John Travolta plays Woody Stevens, the supposedly successful guy who has it all, but is actually hiding a divorce from his supermodel wife and his bankrupt status. Martin Lawrence plays Bobby Davis, the henpecked husband who doesn't bring home the bacon. The best performance for me was from William H. Macy as Dudley Frank, the quintessential geek.<br /><br />It was nice to see Macy play this character because he really pulled it off and it was such a welcome change from his honest cop roles. A little dance sequence was once more milked out of Travolta, who also played his role quite well (his face looked like he gets Botoxed regularly!). Marisa Tomei was a nice surprise. She plays Maggy, the owner of the small town diner. Like her character, she has definitely aged and seems to have been forgotten in such a tiny town but she is still quite pretty and has that fragile, approachable appeal. Towards the ending of the film make sure you stay on to watch Wild Hogs' closing credits to see a funny sequence provided by a TV show.</p></body></html>

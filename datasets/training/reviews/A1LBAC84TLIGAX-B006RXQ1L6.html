<meta name="summary" content="BEST. MUSICAL. EVER.  10 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>Chicago quite simply is jaw-dropping. An insatiable, clever, sexy, stylish, and incredibly bizarre masterpiece of film-making that gets the blood pumping and will leave you in awe. A sinful delight that temptingly calls to you and you can't take your eyes off the screen at really any point. Pure eye candy and pure deliciousness that no other musical can match. On top of having endless style, it also packs on quite a story.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: It's the 1920's in the most corrupt city in America; Chicago. When a woman named Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) murders a man she was sleeping with (And cheating on her husband) after she discovered he lied to her about getting her into show business, she of course ends up going to jail with the possibility of being hanged along with her idol Velma Kelly played by Catherine Zeta-Jones (Who killed her husband and sister after she caught them together). They both hire a lawyer named Billy Flynn (Richard Gere); a man who is all about women and money and has never lost a case defending a female client. Roxie and Velma hate each other and are trying to grab all of the media attention by making themselves out to be innocent in some rather strange ways. Now these girls are out to get each other and prove their innocence simultaneously, all while Billy sits back and revels in the glory. Prepare yourself for a film you won't soon forget.<br />MUSIC: Every musical scene is vibrant and filled with life. No musical scene rested on its laurels and they all delivered slam-bang showcases of wonder and amazement. There is not a single bad musical scene, they were all simply amazing and brilliant the whole way through.<br />ACTING: Fantastic and superbly accomplished in every way. There was not a single dull character and they all felt alive and interesting, even the actors I've never been a fan of (Queen Latifah for example). I have absolutely no gripes against any of the performances in this film at all.<br />ACTION: This film was never boring and there was always something happening. Whether it be one of the many amazing musical scenes or even the funny bits of humor, everything came to life. The cinematography, set pieces, and visual look are simply to die for. Though this film is PG-13, this is definitely not a film for kids and at times it is borderline R-rating with the copious sexual content and some scenes of violence. An adult musical all the way.<br />OVERALL: If you have taste in film, then Chicago is a must-have that will blow you away and you will relish every moment of it. A treat for the mind and the soul that burns into your memory and won't let go. The best damn musical to ever hit cinema, period. Go watch it now.<br />THE GOOD: Everything.<br />THE BAD: Nothing.</p></body></html>

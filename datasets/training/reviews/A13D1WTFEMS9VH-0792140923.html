<meta name="summary" content="Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you"></head><body><p>This movie is quite unlike any you have ever seen. It is a magical mystery tour through the formative times of the baby boom generation, with a simple and guileless man as our guide. Forrest Gump is like the literary character created by Richard Powell, whose "strength is as the strength of ten because his heart is pure". The world around him spins like a top, slowly wobbling until it falls, and through it all Forrest's simple character acts like a rudder in the water. He steers us through exciting and troubled times, from the rise of Elvis to the fall of Vietnam, the cynicism of Watergate and the nasty hangovers from free love that wasn't so free and one too many trips on the Marrakesh Express. The movie deftly captures this space in time with the perfect blend of music (that just slaps you in the head with its freshness and lack of premeditation) and images that are culled from the back pages of your mind. It skips like a stone across the hopes and dreams of a once idealistic generation that were launched like a rocket into space, only to suffer a fiery reentry as it all came crashing back to earth. What a ride. We lost our innocence, but Forrest did not lose his. We lost our heroes, but Forrest shows us true heroism with his own simple example. We lost our way, but we can find it again. This movie is not to be missed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Sin is IN"></head><body><p>This is one of the best comic book inspired films released to date.No doubt,film making is changed forever.The entire film was done via green screen photography filmed on a sound stage with partial/limited sets and props,everything was digital added later.Unlike other films that try so hard with special effects that actually destroy their integrity,the ways and means that it is done in this format only enhances it.Next to its technical atributes,the film was done without a script,or a screenplay.Everything was taken directly from the graphic novels which not only served as the script and screen play,but all the storyboarding as well.<br /><br /> Now that I am done praising all the technical things,the film itself was way cool.Dark,gritty,interesting characters all intertwined in one way or another with the main story.I dare not give away any of it.For those of you who did not see this movie on the big screen,you are in for a real treat.I need not mention the very sexy and beautiful Jessica Alba.Not only does she sport the looks and attitude,but the girl can act as well.Not your typical damsel in distres that screams at the top of her lungs thoughout the entire film.My other favorites of course were Mickey Rourke(who you can barely recognize) as the man on a mission Marv,but don't forget Pretty Boy played by the excellent actor Benicio Del Toro.This film is an awsome site not only does it hit all the senses of looks,texture,gritty interesting characters,but you can almost smell&taste it as well.This film ROCKS!.</p></body></html>

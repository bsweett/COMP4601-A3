And what if we ignored just about every scientific or geological fact on record? And let's rip off a couple of older movies...wouldn't it be really cool to toss in a nod to Hitchcock at the beginning?&quot;<p>Yup, &quot;The Core&quot; is really that bad. So bad, that I was half expecting some stop action animated dinosaurs at the center of the earth as an explanation as to why the core had stopped rotating. But instead, we get the same old Military/Industrial complex conspiracy goop. At least &quot;Armageddon&quot; kept the politics to popcorn rah rah. And the less said about the derivative, cheesy disaster effects, the better. After &quot;Independence Day&quot; or &quot;Deep Impact,&quot; if you're going to level a city, you'd better have more than boiling water and crazed pigeons. <p>It gets two stars becuase Hilary Swank and Stanely Tucci don't totally embarrass themselves. But folks, if this is the best you can get, you need new agents.</p></body></html>

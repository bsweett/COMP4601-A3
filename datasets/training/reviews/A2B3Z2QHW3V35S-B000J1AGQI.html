<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie"></head><body><p>I think this is a great movie. I like it because it is a true story. I am a fan of true story/history movies. This movie can also be very heart breaking, but it can also make you feel proud of all of those man.<br /><br />My husband has been wanting to join the Navy since he was a kid. He still does till this day, but now there seems to be a waiting list here in Abq to join the Navy doing Medical. There are day's I wish he was in the Navy. Just because it is something he wants to do. But then there are thoughts of this movie that makes me happy he isn't in the Navy and I know that he is a lot safer at his job then out in the battle field. Which is where he would have been because he is a medical.</p></body></html>

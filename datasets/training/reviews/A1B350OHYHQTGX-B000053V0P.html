<meta name="summary" content="THE ONLY BEST OF Will Smith"></head><body><p>In a way this movie reminds me of another great movie &quot;Armageddon&quot;. Both has the same thrill and suspense not to forget the amazing computer effects.<p>I am not a big fan of Will Smith but I must admit that I see he did a great job... especially for giving a light sense of humor to the movie.<p>Of course this movie wouldn't have been successful without its rich effects. And this DVD wouldn't have been rich without its extras!</p></body></html>

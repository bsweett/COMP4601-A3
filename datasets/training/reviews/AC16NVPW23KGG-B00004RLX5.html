<meta name="summary" content="IV is Fun!"></head><body><p>Sit back and just enjoy the ride!This Trek is so much fun I have talked to non-followers of Trek and they love this one!I can see why.Best scene is in hospital with Dr. McCoy and 20th century medicine(&quot;My God man,  drilling holes in his head is not the answer!&quot;).Spock trying to fit in  by cursing is by far the funniest comic relief in any trek(&quot;Admiral,  the use of language has altered since our arrival.&quot;)  One of the  other things that I like about this Trek vehicle is the excellent  continuity.It is a bonafide sequel to Trek III-Search For Spock.Nothing is  forgotten. Kirk and company still have to return to earth and face court  martial for violations of Starfleet regulations.Whale special effects are  incredible as well.Kudos to Nimoy for an outstanding directorial effort.</p></body></html>

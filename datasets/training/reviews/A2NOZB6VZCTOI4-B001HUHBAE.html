<meta name="summary" content="Atmospheric Crime Drama Worthy Of The Graysmith Books"></head><body><p>"Zodiac", by Robert Graysmith is one of the greatest nonfiction crime books ever written. Graysmith's agonizing reconstruction of the late 1960s and early 1970s Zodiac murders in California is astonishing in its own right, and this feature is worthy of his efforts. Though the case remains technically open in several California jurisdictions, the suspect thought most likely to have committed the murders, Arthur Leigh Allen, was never charged and died of a heart attack several years ago.<br /><br />The film is brilliant in its representation of the era, with all the details from types of cars to airliner paint schemes nearly perfect in every way. It is brilliantly directed by David Fincher as a dark and menacing drama. "Zodiac" is extraordinarily creepy and nuanced while never resorting to gore (though some of the murders are graphic), with great lighting and details: I liked the oppressive rain throughout much of the film, for instance.<br /><br />The acting is superb, with Jake Gyllenhaal playing the introverted Graysmith, an inspired performance by Robert Downey, Jr. as a drug and alcohol addicted reporter, Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards perfectly cast as homicide investigators, and the brilliant John Carroll Lynch ("Fargo") as Arthur Leigh Allen.<br /><br />The only critique I have of the film is that at 157 minutes, it is rather long, and could have probably been trimmed by fifteen minutes quite easily. Without question, "Zodiac" is a research-intensive and detail-oriented picture, which embodies the best of true crime drama.</p></body></html>

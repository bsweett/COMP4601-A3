He wears many rings and medals, and two ivory-handled revolvers. He gives a speech on the need for winning. "America will never lose a war." [Was this from an actual speech?] They show North Africa, the Kasserine Pass in 1943 Tunisia. People scrounge for goods among the battlefield. Major General Bradley looks over the area to check the reports. He needs a tough tank commander to do better. Patton arrives to inspect the soldiers. The American forces had inferior equipment (no mention of less experience). Patton plans on more discipline for the soldiers.<br /><br />An air attack provides drama. Where is the air cover? A message tells of a planned attack by Rommel. [The British broke the German code and could plan ahead.] The Americans dig in to await the attack. [No air cover? The battle scene is staged to minimize the number of actors.] The Americans and British win. Where will they attack next? Patton has a plan to take Palermo in a flanking attack. He offers his respects to the Cardinal (he knows politics). Patton wants another attack behind enemy lines so he can capture Messina first. Later he visits an Army hospital and slaps a patient who appears to be unwounded. [In fact that soldier was suffering from malaria.] The Allies parade through Messina. Ike orders Patton to apologize for slapping a soldier; he does so.<br /><br />In Corsica Patton pays tribute to the Free French forces under Generals De Gaulle and Le Clerc. Ike has to fight the enemy and keep the allies together. Patton will take part in a deception designed to draw German forces to the Pas de Calais. Did he insult our Russian allies? [Are there forces out to get Patton?] Patton is given command of the 3rd Army for a flanking attack. Bradley explains the strategy to Patton, the target is the rockets launched against London. Patton notices the use of carts by the Germans, their end is near. [A shortage of oil and gasoline.] The Battle of the Bulge halts their advance. Patton's forces race to Bastogne to attack the enemy. Will prayer help? Clear weather brings air cover. Patton is cool at a victory celebration. What will he say? Does he guard his tongue? Is he out of his mind? [Did somebody think he outlived his usefulness?] "All glory is fleeting."<br /><br />After four decades I note how this film is padded to fill out its three hours. This is one film that isn't as impressive as when first seen. Did this film try to improve Patton's image? George C. Scott refused to accept his award for this film. Scott later starred in a sequel that provided another view of Patton but it wasn't as successful. People like a movie with a happy ending that makes them feel good. Your opinion may vary. This film glides over Patton's reactionary politics and presents him as a colorful character. What other general ever slapped a patient in a hospital? Could he have been suffering from some disease?</p></body></html>

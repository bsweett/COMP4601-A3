(mind) during the whole movie and that word was terrible...I couldn't believe what I was seeing...this movie was boring, predictable, and pointless...there was no plot, no suspense, and nothing to recommend it...I was mad when I found out that Jodie Foster had turned down this role, but after seeing it, she seems like a really smart lady...avoid at all costs, this one takes cheesy horror to the extreme....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie."></head><body><p>This was a good movie when I saw it back in 1997.  It was fun to watch and you didn't have to think much about it.  When the sequel to this movie came out, I rented this movie again, I saw this as a masterpiece compared to the sequel out right now.  However just like Twister and Independence Day it hasn't aged well and gets on your nerves if you watch it more than once.  If you haven't seen it rent it not buy it because once is all you will ever need to see this movie.</p></body></html>

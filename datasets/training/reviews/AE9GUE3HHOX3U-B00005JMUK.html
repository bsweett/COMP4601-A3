Roger Ebert even went on record saying this was one of the best performances he had ever seen in film history. (Considering how many thousands of films critics see, that's saying ALOT).  I still can't believe it's her when I see the movie.  What an amazing transformation, up there with Nicole Kidman's in "The Hours".  Charlize's performance is so gut wrenching and sad it almost makes you  feel sorry for this woman you almost forget is a serial killer. You end up feeling so bad for her when she's out trying to turn her life around and go on job interviews, only to be scoffed at and denied,  (i'm sure we've all felt that rejection at some time in our lives).  I only wonder if Ailleen Wournos actually did try to find a way out. Rather than view this movie as a play by play real life crime drama, I was more impressed with the brilliant acting.  Christina Ricci also did a great acting job, she's always a trip.  I have no idea how Charlize channeled the aura and energy of her character but it is almost unreal to watch. A sad and ironic twist of fate that Miss Wuornos didn't get to see the movie about her crime spree life and an academy award won in her essence.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="De Palma does it again"></head><body><p>Most of you probably know that this review will be about as far from objective as you can get. I love Brian De Palma. I don't think that I could hate anything he makes. That being said, I don't absolutely love everything he does either. So when I go see a De Palma film, I basically expect to either love it more than anything or just think it was pretty good. The Black Dahlia, fortunately, applies to the former. This movie is amazing on so many levels, that it really should get an entire post of its own. But since I don't have the time, I am going to make this short and amazingly sweet. The actors in the film are amazing (exception with Josh Hartnett, who isn't bad, but he isn't great, either). Scarlett Johannson and Hilary Swank both portray women in the 50s on totally opposite ends of the spectrum on every level. Aaron Eckhart is great in a sadly under-utilized role as the detective who becomes obsessed with the Dahlia case and is also dealing with extremely dangerous events from his past coming back to haunt him. The film looks amazing too. You would never know that this entire movie was shot in Bulgaria, but now I just told you, so you do know. They recreated 40s L.A. like you couldn't imagine. And to top it all off, Brian De Palma puts his ultimate stamp on the film. What else could I ask for? By far the best scene of the film is the "De Palma set piece" of the movie. A huge marble staircase in the lobby of a skyscraper is the background for one of the most intense, heart-stopping sequences that I can remember in recent memory. And to make it even more excruciating for the viewer, De Palma trademarks it by shooting it all in total slow motion. Unbelievable. I won't go into the details on the plot, because it is a little tough to describe what's going on without revealing some twists that happen about halfway through. But trust me, The Black Dahlia is a ride worth taking.</p></body></html>

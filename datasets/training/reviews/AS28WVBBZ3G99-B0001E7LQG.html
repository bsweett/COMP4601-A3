I mean, what else is new?<p>I was prepared for a sweet, bright, pretty Diance Keaton. She's a sweetheart, right?<p>I wasn't prepared for the flat-out laugh-out-loud humor, irony, and wit of this charming comedy! Just so much fun...my wife and I were still chuckling as we walked out of the theater into the parking lot.<p>I suspect that all baby boomers will get a big kick out of seeing this film - at home or in the theater! A terrific entertainment value.</p></body></html>

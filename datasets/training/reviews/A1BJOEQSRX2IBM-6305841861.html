<meta name="summary" content="A funny, scary horror cult film!"></head><body><p>This movie has more scares in it than all the Freddy's and Jason's put toguether,and more laughs than all the Ace Ventura movies. Laugh-out-loud funny but also scares you from time to time. Great horror movie to watch  with friends and have fun. Bruce Campbell is superb as Ash, and the whole  idea of the hand-chainsaw and the sawed-off shotgun is great. Also watch  the first one. Deserving of it's cult following. Fun.</p></body></html>

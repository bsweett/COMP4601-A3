<meta name="summary" content="A spot-on parody of dumb Bay/Bruckheimer action movies!"></head><body><p>Matt Stone and Trey Parker are among some of the most clever and most savage satirists working today. Every week on their crudely animated TV show, South Park, they skewer sacred cows like religion, politics and dominant figures in popular culture. Their feature film debut, South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, was a brilliant attack on rampant nationalism and the hypocrisy of the MPAA movie censors. Stone and Parker are back with another ingenious effort, Team America World Police, an action film done with puppets in the tradition of the classic Thunderbirds TV show.<br /><br />Like any good satire, Stone and Parker play it completely straight, never winking at the audience. Satire that works is almost always misinterpreted and rarely appreciated when it first comes out. Case in point: the South Park movie which wasn't the mega-blockbuster that the studio had hoped but has since developed a loyal cult following. I can see Team America heading the same way. One of the things that makes this movie so funny is that it goes after targets so in need of being satirized.<br /><br />The Unrated Version of this movie features a slightly longer, more disturbingly explicit puppet sex scene, which, not surprisingly, did not pass the MPAA censors.<br /><br />"Team America: An Introduction" has Parker and Stone introduce the members of the team. They mention that this movie was a conscious decision to take a giant step back, technology-wise, and a response to the excessive use of CGI in contemporary action movies.<br /><br />"Building the World" takes a look at the ambitious sets built for this movie. Production designer Jim Dultz had to recreate a believable Bruckheimer-esque world. The scale is truly impressive as is the amount of detail.<br /><br />"Crafting the Puppets" features puppet producer Edward Chiodo who talks about how he helped realize Matt and Trey's vision. We are taken through the design process (size, sculpting, etc.), how they are put together and so on.<br /><br />"Pulling the Strings" is a brief look at the art of puppeteering and how the film's puppeteers tried to achieve everything Matt and Trey wanted, including large scale action sequences with many puppets on camera at once.<br /><br />"Capturing the Action" takes a look at the film's director of photography, Bill Pope (who worked on The Matrix movies). He talks about applying normal action film camera moves to this movie and how he had to adjust said techniques for a smaller scale.<br /><br />"Miniature Pyrotechnics" shows how they pulled off some of the great looking explosions in camera and with no CGI.<br /><br />"Up Close with Kim Jong-Il" features Matt and Trey talking about why they cast the notorious North Korean dictator as the film's villain. In their research, they found out that he is huge film buff and hope that he gets to see this movie.<br /><br />Also included are "Dressing Room" and "Puppet" tests that are essentially demo reels trying out certain moves and actions with the puppets.<br /><br />There are ten "Deleted/Extended Scenes and Outtakes" totaling six minutes. One of the highlights is a funny bit with Team America's commander talking about his hatred of Winnie the Pooh that should not have been cut.<br /><br />"Animated Storyboards" showcase the drawings created to plot out and frame six scenes from the movie.<br /><br />Finally, there are two theatrical trailers.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Abuse of the vulnerable"></head><body><p>This movie shows the vulnerability of humanity at it's best. It is based on a true story of a psychopathic mass murderer. It is also a story about one woman taking advantage of another at thier weakest moment when she was down. This is not a pleasant story nor is it a happy one. It is an important story because it is a true story that could have happened to anyone at thier weakest moment.</p></body></html>

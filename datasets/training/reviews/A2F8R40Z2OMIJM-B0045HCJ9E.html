<meta name="summary" content="DVD Looks Great, Classic Hitchcock"></head><body><p>NORTH BY NORTHWEST was my favorite Hitchcock film for many years.  I was a  teenager and much preferred Hitch's classy, sexy man-on-the-run film to any  of the films of the 80's (besides STAR WARS!)  The just-released DVD of  this 1959 film looks excellent.  The colors and crispness of the picture  are truly extraordinary.  Again, I praise the benefits of DVD!  And this  disc is such a great example of how to do it right, especially with our  older films.<p>The documentary that accompanies the film is hosted by Eva  Marie Saint (who is still a handsome and classy lady).  Although not as  thorough as the documentaries on recent Hitch DVD releases (MARNIE, THE  BIRDS...) this one will do.  There are some nice behind the scenes photos  and info.  The documentary director seems to skim over everything,  however.<p>My favorite thing about NORTH BY NORTHWEST (besides all the  obvious Hitch directing embelishments...) is the script by Ernest Lehman.  This is a GREAT script.  And no one writes sexy leading man and leading  lady dialogue like Lehman:  &quot;I'm a big girl,&quot; coos Eva Marie  Saint.  &quot;Yes, and in all the right places,&quot; responds suave Cary  Grant.  This is just perfect!  And the sex is implied.  I am not a prude --  it is just so smart the way Lehman &quot;hooks up&quot; Grant and Saint in  the train scene.  You don't need to show them having sex.  And when we get  to the auction scene later in the film, Saint gives such an emotional  performance that you know is rooted in the train scene.<p>And the chase at  Mt. Rushmore in the final reel is very exciting and stylistic all at once.  Hitch is a genius.<p>Welcome, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, to the modern world!  You've never looked better.</p></body></html>

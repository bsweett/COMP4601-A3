John Travolta, you can now breath a sigh of relief because "Alien Vs Predator" has risen to dethrone "Battlefield Earth" as the most ridiculous science-fiction-fightfest of the modern era. Between the mooncrater sized plot holes (the humans discerning thousands of years of history from a few lines of hieroglyphics was my favorite) to deconstructing six movies' worth of characterization in barely 90 minutes, this scriptless wonder was generating unintended laughs from the audience I was sharing this misery with. The actual fight scenes were so Bugs Bunny/Road Runner goofy that snickers were breaking out on a regular basis. You gotta love it when the Predator starts swinging an Alien around by the tail, like it was a loose cat.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, this movie has more wardrobe malfunctions than a superbowl half-time extravaganza. The Predators have cloaks of invisibility that suddenly seem to give out during the last fifteen minutes. Same for their "I can see the little thing inside you" goggles. And if I was trapped alone in the night of an Antarctic winter, I'd really think I'd look like I was really COLD if I was dressed in a friggin' T-SHIRT! But I guess anything logical is not to be expected when the pyramid shifts every ten minutes - except near the end when the clock must have busted and allowed the passages to just move at random. Believe it or not THE SETS ARE THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!!! (Thus saving this review from dropping to one star.)Even the sets are cribbed from somewhere else. If you see "AvP" when it makes its inevitable DVD Director's Cut appearance, think of "The Mummy" as the hapless humans scurry around this Alien Antfarm.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Go rent the newly issued PREDATOR or the first two ALIEN movies if you want to remember exactly how good-old jump out of your chair sci-fi scares are created. Then pray that "Freddy Vs Alien Vs Jason Vs Predator Vs The Rugrats" isn't the next brilliant idea to puke out of the bowels of the current Hollywood scriptmill critter spitter.</p></body></html>

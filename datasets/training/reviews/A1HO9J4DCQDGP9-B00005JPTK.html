<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable film, great soundtract, good acting"></head><body><p>Okay I have read the book and seen the film, usually I like one but not the other but in this case I like both even though one is not like the other!<br /><br />The plot centres around the last man alive in the world  Robert Neville played by the brilliant actor and rapper Will Smith (or so he thinks) who is immune to a terrible blood plague that has ravaged the whole known world.<br /><br />With his faithful sidekick, a beautiful Alsation called Sam Neville tries to set write a wrong that he has played a part in and paid the price, for he has has lot his family and now the only family he has left is his dog.<br /><br />A slow start quickly gathers momentum as the world goes to hell on a handcard, and we are treated to seat of your pants special effects, a fabulous sound track and some genuinely scary and "jump out of your" skin moments!<br /><br />People have compared this film to Charlton Hestons <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0BU">The Omega Man</a> and there are some similarities but I think Omega Man is far darker than I am Legend even though both have a very similar ending.<br /><br />With a great supporting cast including the understated Alison Braga and even Will Smith's daughter Willow, playing his on screen daughter, you have a great movie that packs a punch and is good enough to recommend to your mates.<br /><br />However the real scene stealer is Sam the dog, but then I was always a sucker for a cute dog who can act!<br /><br />Worth seeing.</p></body></html>

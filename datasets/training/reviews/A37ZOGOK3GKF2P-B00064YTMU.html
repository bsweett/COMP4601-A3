<meta name="summary" content="Cruise Out-Foxxed By Jamie"></head><body><p>One of the best films of the year, and a certain bold move by Tom Cruise, the real star of this vehicle is Jamie Foxx.  It was a good transition film for him going from those silly "Booty Call" type of movies to serious work.  Tom Cruise is great as a villain, an assassin who has an agenda and is relentless in his pursuits.  This film has it all.  Great direction from Micheal Mann, and a moving score.  Star making performance for Foxx.  Great action and some comedy too.</p></body></html>

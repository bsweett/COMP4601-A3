Even after all the copycats since, the film has lost none of its powers to evoke the most primal fears in all of us.<br /><br />Psycho is about false appearances and how we are deceived by them. How a beautiful normal looking woman can all of a sudden just snap and do something evil out of the blue. This, along with split-personality disorders, is what Psycho is all about. About the vast gulf separating those who may do something on a whim, such as cheating on their taxes, ripping a DVD, etc., and those who are genuinely psychotic.<br /><br />This is one of Hitchcock's best looking black and white films, more shades of gray as though to amplify the ambiguous nature of good and evil, that good and evil resides in all of us in various proportions.<br /><br />But philosophy and metaphor aside, Psycho is a great film for the ages created in a time where there were no gimmicks like 3D or cgi to hide behind. A classic in every sense of the word and worth the 12 bucks or so you can buy it here for. Lastly, for those who haven't seen this movie and are sitting on the fence because this is an "old" movie in black and white, remember that color had been around for decades before this movie was made and that black and white was a style choice, as it is when it's used today. There's no such thing as an old movie anyway because if you haven't seen it it's new. Plus, who'd want them to mess up a great film like this with color or, heaven forbid, 3D or cgi? Great fun movie.</p></body></html>

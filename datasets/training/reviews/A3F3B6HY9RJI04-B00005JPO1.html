FOR THIS?!?!?"></head><body><p>Before getting to the theater to watch this new installment of Indiana Jones I watched Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade to help get me in the mood.  I was reminded what a wonderful movie and franchise Indiana Jones was.  And then I went to see this fourth installment.<br /><br />There is no way this could be a bad movie.  Again, it stems from a wonderful franchise and has some of the most leading names in the industry behind it (Harrison Ford, George Lucas, Lucasfilm, Steven Spielberg, Shia LaBeouf, and David Koepp).  How could this go wrong?<br /><br />The fact that it did baffles me.  I understand that Indiana movies are supposed to be fun, but this movie got a little bit too fun.  Being a little over the top is okay, but the extremes that this movie took were too much for me.  For instance, and I only mention this because it is right at the beginning of the movie, a man cannot be blown away several miles within a refrigerator, drop, roll a few hundred yards for good measure, and then get out and dust himself off.  And if something this implausible happened once or twice throughout the movie I think I could be okay with it but something like this happened every ten minutes.<br /><br />I wouldn't be so upset about this but the rest of the franchise isn't like this.  Indiana Jones wasn't quite so immortal.  The storyline was never this predictable.  The plot was never so thin.  You would think that after twenty years that something wonderful would be created.  I'm extremely disappointed.<br /><br />And some of the changes... changing from Nazis to Cold War Soviets as the enemy was a needed change.  Harrison Ford/Indiana Jones is now 20 years older so if Nazis were still around there would be a lot of explaining to do.  But the fact that Indiana Jones now goes by Henry irked me extremely.  Indiana's name has ALWAYS been Henry but he has ALWAYS gone by the name Indiana.  There was no reason to change it so friends called him Henry only because Sean Connery mentioned it was his real name as the end of the third movie.  And somewhere along the line Indiana Jones became a Colonel.  What is that all about?  Also, they couldn't pull Sean Connery out of retirement to do this movie.  That's too bad, but I can understand Sean wanting to remain in retirement.  But how about a two minute cameo like he did in Robin Hood?  How about at least leaving the door open to future cameos if they start making more Indiana movies?  No, instead they have him killed off.  Just closed that door.<br /><br />There were some good things about this, however.  Harrison Ford could not have done any better in his reprisal of Indiana Jones.  He flowed back into the role like he had been playing it for the last twenty years.  Harrison Ford is one of this and last generation's greatest actors and this movie reminds us why this is.  Shia LaBeouf's star keeps rising and I, for the most part, enjoyed his role in this movie.  There were some light-hearted funny moments and hearing the Indiana Jones score by John Williams on the big screen filled me with a flood of memories.<br /><br />Despite the two-star rating, I'd advise seeing it at least once if you are an Indiana Jones fan.  If this were a regular movie I would have given it three stars but I docked it a star for its lost potential.  It really should have been soooooo much more than it turned out to be.</p></body></html>

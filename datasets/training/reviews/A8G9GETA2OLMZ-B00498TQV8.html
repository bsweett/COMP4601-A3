<meta name="summary" content="Harsh, Gritty"></head><body><p>This one is gritty realism at its grittiest.<br /><br />A 17 year old girl in rural (REALLY rural) Missouri is taking care of her younger brother and sister, and her mother, who is mysteriously incapacitated and never speaks a word.  They get by, barely, by shooting squirrels, accepting handouts, and not much else.<br /><br />The father, who is absent, must appear for a court date or the family will lose the house and land (a large forest), which he has put up as bond.<br /><br />The girl goes on a search, against violently antagonistic family and neighbors, for the father.<br /><br />She finally succeeds, with almost-worse-than-nothing help, and the outcome is cold comfort.<br /><br />This is a tremendously stark movie.  The acting is great, though dour.  The setting is documentary-real: patched-siding shacks, cannibalized cars and trucks in every yard, scraggy chickens, chained barking dogs.  And the entire society seems powered by meth.  (That's what the father is charged with.)<br /><br />And yet it is really beautiful and bracing.<br /><br />Just don't expect to go away humming the music.</p></body></html>

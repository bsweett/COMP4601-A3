<meta name="summary" content="AVP - One of the better Combo movies!!"></head><body><p>I thought that Jason VS Freddy was going to be one of the best horror flicks ever...Yeah Not!!<br />I was really disappointed when I saw it for the first & the second & even the third time!!<br />Then I heard that there was going to be a Aliens VS Predator and I even waited until it came out on DVD!!<br />To me it did more justice than JVF, AVP had a better story!!<br />I rate this DVD a 4 of 5 stars!!</p></body></html>

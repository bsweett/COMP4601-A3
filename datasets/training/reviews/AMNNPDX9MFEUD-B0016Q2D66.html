A line about inventory control underscores the heart of where he and his wife April (Kate Winslet) find themselves: "Knowing what you've got, knowing what you need, knowing what you can do without..." Those answers seemed clear until Frank second-guessed himself, tempted by offers of prestige and money. If there is one lesson I have learned in life and that I will continuously remind my children of, it is that second guessing yourself, going against what your instincts tell you, is always the wrong thing to do. Revolutionary Road is a movie about a couple who face this crossroad in life and differ as to the right direction they should take. April listens to her instincts despite the dark uncertainty of her choice. Frank follows the well-lit and safe path.<br />Revolutionary Road is a movie that splits people on either side, with those who feel it is a study in whiny, selfish, and immature suburbanites wishing for a better life than they currently have. Then there are those like me who felt a deep connection to them, in particular April; the one of the pair that seems the most trapped in the suburban dream and the one whose escape is the most critical<br />Of the two, April is largely attacked in reviews and I can't figure that out. She is the one accused of screwing things up and being the most difficult and unrealistic. Yet, she is the one who comes up with the idea to move to Paris as a gift to her husband. She is the one who realizes that "living life as if it matters" is beyond any price tag. If any one is at fault in my interpretation, it is Frank, who takes the path of least resistance and condemns his wife to a world of "emptiness and hopelessness."<br />What this movie does is give voice to the minority of people who, like Winslet's character, find themselves trapped inside someone else's dream. Some of us break through, but most stay there, slowly wilting and collapsing under the strain of denying oneself of their own needs, suppressing one's soul, and doing what you feel you are supposed to do. Understand clearly that I am not making an indictment of the suburbs et al. For most people in the world, most people I know, and most people living that life, there is not the oppressive feeling of wasting life and the angst therein. What I am saying is that there are those of us who do not feel the same way about that life choice and this movie speaks to us. It's knee-jerk to not only take offense at the dim view Revolutionary Road portrays of The American Dream, but furthermore to see the Wheelers as little more than a spoiled couple; the assumption being they have everything and still they want more. On the contrary, my opinion is that being spoiled means wanting more and yet not wanting to give up what you have. The character of April Wheeler does not want what she has and knows what she needs - not more, but something entirely different. For those who have been in her tormented shoes, Revolutionary Road is a place some of us call Hell.</p></body></html>

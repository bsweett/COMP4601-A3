<meta name="summary" content="Still A Classic"></head><body><p>I remember being very young and seeing this movie when it first came out, and being afraid to go in the water for awhile. I recently purchased this movie and watched it for the first time in years just to see if Speilberg's movie still had as intense effect on the screen as it did almost 30 years ago. The answer is: definitely. <p>This was the first in the line of &quot;blockbuster&quot; movies, and, unlike many that flop today, this is a movie that has stood the test of time. The story of a Long Island town that is terrorized by an enormous great white shark is done with great direction.It is a simple story really, but the action and acting are not overdone, and even for it's time, the movie is still has great quality.  There is not too much of the mystery surrounding the shark given away in the first half of the movie, and this creates a good build up of tension and suspense that this genre of movie needs. <p>The camera angles that are created add to the overall quality of the film. For instance, while Brody is on the boat we first get a glimpse of the sea from an overhead angle, and then a glimpse of the boat underneath. The suspense comes in waiting for the great white. Jaws is still a classic, and the kind of movie that you think about when you go to the beach and take your first step into the water.</p></body></html>

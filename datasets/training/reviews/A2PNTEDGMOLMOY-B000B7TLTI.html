<meta name="summary" content="Amazing, Hilarious Super-Hero Tale -- "PG," not "G""></head><body><p>Brad Bird's "The Incredibles" serves up additional proof (as if any was needed) that the good folks at Pixar are the most consistent filmmaking team in the business.  While much of the Pixar filmography is aimed at the younger set (albeit with plenty of goodies for the adults to delight in, too), "The Incredibles" is a definite turn toward a more mature audience.<br /><br />The plot of "The Incredibles" is well-known -- a family of superheroes are denied the right to exercise their talents by our litigious society -- the "supers'" fall from grace is the subject of a wonderful opening sequence.  Placed in a superhero-relocation program (as the Parr family, appropriately enough), the "supers" chafe at their imposed restrictions -- one of the strongest themes of the movie is the undeniable power of a person's need to achieve their full potential.<br /><br />Stuck in a cubicle in suburbia, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) jumps at the resume his former superhero identity on the sly . . . a plot that leads him into a potential (and apparent) affair as well as a clash with Syndrome (Jason Lee), a mad scientist-superhero hybrid from Mr. Incredible's past.<br /><br />Soon the rest of the Parrs are on the hunt to save their captured patriarch.  Mrs. Parr, aka Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and her tots, Dash and Violet risk death and dismemberment (in some amazing chase scenes sure to inspire a heck of a video game) as they seek to save dear old dad.  Their quest takes them from a tropical island to the streets of the Big City where Syndrome unleashes the ultimate killer robot.  Allied with old chum Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), the Incredibles put up a tremendous fight against Syndrome and his colossus - a delight for fans of all ages.<br /><br />For parents of tykes, be warned that this movie is a bit more mature than "A Bug's Life," "Toy Story," and other Pixar fare.  There is a sub-plot involving possible marital infidelity, although it doesn't go very deep in exploring this, and it's undeniable that Mr. Incredible adores Elastigirl, and vice versa.  Many of Syndrome's anonymous henchmen obviously die in high-speed chases (their cool flying vehicles crash in blazing glory, leaving their grim fate pretty obvious), and Syndrome is a lethal opponent of the "supers."  This is a bit dark for some youngsters and parents may have some 'splainin' to do to their younger kids, so be warned -- don't pop in this DVD just 'cause it says "Pixar" and presume that no child will be a bit frightened.  Most kids will absolutely adore this movie, of course, as will most adults.<br /><br />The extras on this DVD are wonderful - two animated shorts, "Boundin'," which is an enchanting poem about a vain sheep and a wise jackalope, as well as a snippet of a parallel story from the movie involving a hilarious babysitter are sure to delight. There's even a silly retro-cartoon featuring Mr. Incredible and Frozone in more "primitive" times, and this extra is even more enjoyable when the commentary track is employed. There are no "out-takes" that I could find, which was a disappointment, but all things considered this is an excellent DVD for a wonderful family film.</p></body></html>

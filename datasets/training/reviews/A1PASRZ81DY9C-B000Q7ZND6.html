Of course, Constantine had the film noir going on, but it's too pretentious in trying to be a pastiche in that genre. It would be nice to have a good movie that will literally focus on the meat of the story and try to develop that while having the quality of the acting, but it turns out that Constantine is an excuse, as the rest of my films released after the year 2000, to display very boring and overblown computer graphics. Come on, I want a story, not an abuse on my eyes. `3' was given for trying decently enough to get the story going, but lost points for being a waste of time. I feel like I am watching a rehash of The Matrix in The Exorcist disguise. Any time of the day, I would watch The Exorcist or The Omen over Constantine. Why? Because it was about the story. Because it focused on the acting. Because there were no computer graphics. Because it is enjoyable and easy to follow. Constantine? Forget it. The secret is to simplify it. Less is more.</p></body></html>

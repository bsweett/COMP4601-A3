<meta name="summary" content=""Totally wicked!!" Pixar Goes Beyond Infinity"></head><body><p>Like a kid in the movie cries out to Mr. Incredible, as he lifts a car in the air, that's how I felt about the latest movie from Pixar: "Totally wicked!!" (or for those over 15, "Totally cool!")<br /><br />After five consecutive hits, it's tough to imagine how the animation and storytelling superpower could outdo themselves, but they pulled it off! With a retro feel and a blend of humor and James Bond-style action, comes 2004's most anticipated new animated movie. From the first frame to the closing titles, "The Incredibles" balances incredible animation with a fun and touching story that has something for everyone.<br /><br />Without a dull moment, the movie captures your imagination and makes the life of the Parr superhero family seem as real as yours or mine, as they very much face the same ailments and challenges that we encounter in the way. Big bellies and tight clothes, a frustrating job, an annoying boss: who hasn't faced some of these (maybe all) at some point? This makes it tough not to relate to Mr. Parr and his family of superheroes, confined to living a "normal" life after an ungrateful society and a host of lawsuits put his kind under public scrutiny and forced him out of his 'sexy' role, in charge of saving the world.<br /><br />Animation highlights almost top the story, making the characters more than believable. Shots of the characters floating in the sea, perfectly looking low-lit scenes and even a rescue scene in the midst of a fire are only some examples of the type of technical work you are up against. And it's all so natural, they make it seem easy!<br /><br />The truth is that there's nothing easy about putting together such a solid movie. A story that makes you think and laugh, and a technical achievement that is bound to become another classic. In short, "totally wicked!" Pixar, once again, has gone beyond infinity!</p></body></html>

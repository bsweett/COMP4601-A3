<meta name="summary" content="(2.5 STARS) Great Performance in a Not So Great Movie"></head><body><p>"The Iron Lady" got two Oscars nominations (Best Achievement in Makeup and Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role) and won both, but received no other nominations. Perhaps this fact tells you something about this biographical movie about Margaret Thatcher here played by Meryl Streep. Not surprisingly, Meryl Streep shows what a seasoned performer like her can do, and you will not be disappointed with her acting. As to the film itself, however, maybe you should read a book instead.<br /><br />My complaint is a simple one. This is a life story of a political icon Margaret Thatcher, and that means it is full of events, so why not tell the story in a straightforward and linear way?<br /><br />Instead of that, "The Iron Lady" insists on showing Margaret Thatcher in her later years, seeing hallucinatory visions of her deceased husband Denis (Jim Broadbent). The film goes back and forth in time between today when aged Margaret Thatcher is seen talking with Denis, and several important episodes in her political career like the Falklands War.<br /><br />I don't know who is responsible for the unnecessarily complicated narrative structure, writer Abi Morgan ("Shame") or director Phyllida Lloyd ("Mamma Mia!"). Despite the solid performances from the supports including Richard E. Grant and Anthony Head, "The Iron Lady" does not tell us much about Margaret Thatcher, whether as a prime minister or a person.</p></body></html>

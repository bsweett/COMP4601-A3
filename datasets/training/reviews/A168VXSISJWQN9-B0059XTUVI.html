Not only the first woman prime minister, but also one of the most committed to her viewpoint, she took Britain by the scruff of the neck and shook it up. The changes Thatcher made were enormous, including destroying the coal-mining industry, increasing home ownership by selling off subsidised housing to the tenants, mobilising the country for a war in the Falkland Islands, slashing government spending and many more. Some people were helped by the changes, some hurt, some, such as the union leaders of the mining industry, destroyed. She was intensely, and deliberately, divisive. Her impact was such that the British Labour party completely reinvented itself as 'New Labour', a party unrecognizable from the old Labour party of the 1970s. Thatcher won 3 elections, became the UK's longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century and was ultimately thrown out by her own party. Whatever your feelings towards her, she has to be regarded as the single most important political figure in the UK in the second half of the 20th century.<br /><br />The problem is that this film misses almost all of her impact on society, both positive and negative. Over half the film is given over to an imagined portrait of her in her later years, having conversations with her dead husband. The earlier part of her life is covered in flash-backs, so it lacks continuity and, often, context. In trying to present a portrait of the individual, the film-makers have diminished her actions to a side-issue which is, in her case, entirely inappropriate. Thatcher rarely spoke about her personal feelings and did not let others into her personal life. If ever a person were defined by what she did rather than who she was, it was Margaret Thatcher. The perspective of this movie is all wrong and what should have been a gripping tale of one of the most influential political figures of recent times becomes a rather dreary portrayal of a person in decline.<br /><br />Meryl Streep has been nominated for 17 Oscars and won 3 times. In my view, pretty well all of the 14 performances which did not win were better than this one. That's not a criticism of Streep, who is the most brilliant female actor of our time and turns in an immaculate performance as always. It's just that the part is so poorly drawn that Streep is hardly able to utilise her magnificent skills to make it come alive. Instead, I was left with the uneasy feeling that her Academy Award was not for acting but for impersonation. Streep has so often made characters compelling and unforgettable that to see her win for what was basically a female version of Rich Little was somewhat galling. I suspect in later years she will not look on this award as her finest achievement by a very long way.<br /><br />There is scope for an important film to be made about the life and impact of Margaret Thatcher. This is not it.</p></body></html>

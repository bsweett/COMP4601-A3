<meta name="summary" content="An enchanting adventure of the heart"></head><body><p>This movie was so wonderful, and probably the best I have ever seen.<br />It starts out in war torn spain, and is of a lonely young girl of about 12.<br />Freshly arriving in Spain with her Mother, to meet her new sadistic "stepdad", she comes across a fairy and a fawn, who tell her that she is really a princess from long ago. There have been portals open for years to bring her back to her kingdom, but before this happens, she must perform 3 tasks, to prove her immortality.<br /><br />Without making this too long and giving the whole storyline away, I will say that her quest leads her to the most visually stimulating scenes I have ever seen onscreen.<br />They are terrible and wonderful all at the same time.There are creatures that eat fairies and babies...creatures who have eyes in thier hands, and places so over the top, I can't even imagine how the scenes were created...<br />Beyond all the beautiful visuals though, there lies a very sad story of a lonely innocent girl that is quite touching...<br />This is how Fairytales USED to be at the turn of the century,how  they SHOULD be..until Hollywood RUINED them, just like Alice in Wonderland was ruined, and "Disney-fied" as one reviewer put it.<br /><br />I purchased this DVD when it first came out, and have watched it many times since, and will watch it many more.It is a stunning masterpiece that will leave you in tears.<br />Highly reccomended for adults and older children...NOT for smaller children !!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The original is much better"></head><body><p>If there could be 2 and a half stars, that's the rating I would give this remake. Being of generous spirit, I will resolve the issue by rating it up a half rather than down. The original was the truly gripping version. In the original, the bad guys were communists from Manchuria seeking to take over the government. In this somewaht lame remake, the bad guys constitute a corporation named Manchurian Industries. Without saying more, just think about it ... which premise is the real thriller? In both versions, a brainwshed war veteran is under the control of his domineering mother. Both Angela Lansbury in the original and Meryl Streep in the remake are convincing in that role. Indeed, the highpoint of the film my be an erotic, borderline incestous moment between mother and brainwashed son in the remake. Otherwise, however, the original wins hands down.<br /><br />The setting and relationship between the characters is much better in the original. There, a braiwashed son of a senator and his wife is programmed to do what is necessary to help his father, the vice presidential candidate rise to the top. It is the mother, rather than the father who has the brains. The father, who is the candisate is merely the dopey sooge. in this remake, however, the brainwashed son of Meryl Streep's character (she plays the senator) is the candidate for vice preesident. Excuse me but yeah right!!! That's really believable, that a zombied out brainwashed, unlikabe cad could actually be a candidate for vice president. Additionally, there are scenes where this vice presidential candidate goes off on his own to carry out orders he is programmed to obey. Again, excuse the sarcasm but puleeze!! That's really believable that a vice presidential candidate who would have a secret service detail can somehow just go off on his own.<br /><br />The ending of each movie has a slightly different twist brought on by the fact that in one, the father is the candidate whereas in the other, the brainwashed individual is. I can't reveal the ending because it would ruin the suspense. Trust me, however, the ending works much better in the original.</p></body></html>

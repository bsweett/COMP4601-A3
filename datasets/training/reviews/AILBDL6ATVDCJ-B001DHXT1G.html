She almost steals the show from everyone else involved on the screen.  She works extremely well with Edward Norton, who also makes an excellent Bruce Banner.  The struggle of fighting against the government's plan to use genetic manipulation as a war weapon always makes for a good action flick, and The Hulk does not drop the ball on that history.<br /><br />The storyline keeps moving along, and the rich landscape scenes make this movie play out like an artistic wonderland filled with covert operations and outright war in the streets.  The CGI was able to make The Hulk come off the pages of the comic books and appear on screen.  That said, I still had a problem with the cartoon-look at different times in the movie.  I also found it a little strange that in the final fight scene of the movie there just happened to be a giant chain to for The Hulk and Abomination to choke each other with.  I mean what are the odds that such a huge chain would just fall into the battle in the middle of the city.<br /><br />I do believe Sam Elliot would have been a better choice than William Hurt in the role as General Ross.  I like William Hurt, but in this role, he just seemed a little too stiff.  Elliot would have provided that "is that dude crazy" element.<br /><br />Christina Cabot is always a pleasure to see on any movie screen.  This woman's career has just begun!  Look for her to have way bigger roles in the near future.<br /><br />So, to finish off this review:  If you liked The Incredible Hulk comic books, then you will like the CGI work in this film.  If you have to have perfect CGI in order to get through a script on film, well The Hulk is not the movie for you.<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></body></html>

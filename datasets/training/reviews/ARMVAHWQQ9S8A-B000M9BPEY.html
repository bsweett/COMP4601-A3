<meta name="summary" content="A Fairy Tale for Adults"></head><body><p>"Big Fish" may be Tim Burton's best film.  At the very least, it's his most underrated.  Everyone always talks about his concept work/production on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUOU">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a> and his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004U8P8">older</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729652">work</a>, but I'd argue that this is a more solid film than those.  Instead of comparing, though, I'll just talk about what makes this movie so great.<br /><br />The basic plot is this:  Edward Blood was never the best father, especially through his son's eyes.  He'd always tell patently false tales about his life, often hogging the attention with his fantastic stories.  Now, as he gets closer and closer to death, he recounts his stories to his son and his new daughter in law, in hopes that his son will finally come to know who he truly is.  This sort of story was perfect for Tim Burton, because he gets to finally flex his creative muscle and pull it in multiple ways, since the "telling stories" parts of this movie make this more like an anthology than a straight film.  Burton's over-the-top style often seems like it is just TOO much in some of his films, but his direction was perfect for this movie.<br /><br />It's a whimsical, heart-breaking, fantastic fairy tale for adults.  Not in the dark way that people often assume "for adults" means, but what I mean is that the themes in the story are very much about growing up, what it means to be a man, and the pain and joy and terror of getting old.  A lot of it is silly, but certainly in a good way.  This film is funny, quirky, weird, beautiful, tragic, and hopeful--much like life itself.<br /><br />9/10</p></body></html>

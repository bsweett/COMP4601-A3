<meta name="summary" content=""Twist" ending is lame and insulting"></head><body><p>This infuriatingly pointless movie features one of the most illogical surprise twist-endings I've ever had the misfortune of seeing.  I won't spoil it for anyone, but I will say it renders the movie nearly nonsensical.<br /><br />People have typed many a positive word about the cast's performances, and to be fair there is nothing particularly wrong with the acting.  But a good cast can't save a movie that has no idea what it actually wants to be about.</p></body></html>

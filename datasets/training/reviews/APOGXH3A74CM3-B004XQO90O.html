This is a story built layer upon layer, playing out in bits and getting stronger as it goes along.<br /><br />I didn't expect this at all.  I expected the opposite.<br /><br />This story is told so well, that the viewer becomes emotionally invested in it.  In it's outcome, and the possibilities it presents.<br /><br />A very suspenseful, thoughtful, and witty piece of storytelling craftsmanship.<br /><br />I like being brought into a film, and this does just that.</p></body></html>

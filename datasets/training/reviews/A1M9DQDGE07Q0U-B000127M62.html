<meta name="summary" content="SO INCREDIBLY RIDICULOUS IT HAD TO HAPPEN!"></head><body><p>&quot;Freddy Vs. Jason&quot; is the penultimate blood and guts fest that pits Freddy Kruger against the Crystal Lake psycho - Jason with inevitably predictable results. Conceding that this is a horror movie there is surprising little that's genuinely horrific about the killings. They're rehashed uninspired vignettes from a dozen other knock off, schlock and load junkies. The shock level hasn't been raised even if the budget for this film has.<br />TRANSFER: Good things to talk about here. A really pristine transfer that captures fine detail in the darkest of scenes - and believe me, they're dark! Colors are well balanced. Some minor edge enhancement and a hint of pixelization but really - it's only a hint. The audio is well balanced and just when you think things are getting too quiet it's sure to surprise and kick all five channels into action with all the visceral charm of bringing up one's lunch.<br />EXTRAS: Too many for a film who's plot is this thin. Only if you're a die hard fan of pure junk will you be encouraged to sit through the barrage of thought-numbing nincompoopery. I think it's about time both these murders hung up their torture devices and called it a night - a long one!<br />BOTTOM LINE: I love a good scary movie. This is nothing like one!</p></body></html>

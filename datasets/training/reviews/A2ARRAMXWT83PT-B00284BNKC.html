<meta name="summary" content="Very disturbing and very powerful!"></head><body><p>This has to be one of the most disturbing films that I have ever seen. I just got the video the other day, and let me tell you, it had a strong impact on me. I wasn't really expecting that kind of a &quot;wham-bang&quot; ending! The performances are spectacular, and ELLEN BURSTYN DESERVED THAT OSCAR! No offense to Julia Roberts, but Ellen's performance was the most powerful for the year 2000. I agree with the rest of the reviewers: This film should be shown all around high schools everywhere. It is a graphic, disturbing account of the effects of drugs on four different people and how it sent their hopes and dreams down the toilet. The end will leave you shocked. You will not be able to get this film out of your head for a few days. Believe me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kevin & Co. come up with a winner"></head><body><p>After a series of flops, artistically and commercially, Kevin Costner returned to the genre that first brought him success: the Western.  The best decision he ever made as director/producer was to highlight Robert Duvall in the lead role since he's one of the few actors who look comfortable in Western garb, the other 2 being Clint Eastwood & Tom Selleck.  But it's Duvall's authority and grace which really contribute to making this Western such a success for Costner.  Also he skillfully cast such fine actors in supporting roles such as the great Irish/British actor Michael Gambon as the villain and the late Michael Jeter in his last role as an ally of Duvall & Costner.  The plot of course is simple yet it really doesn't matter here because Costner, unlike Lawrence Kasdan, takes his time in developing every character in the story so that by the end of the finale after the gunsmoke clears--we really care for all of them.  In "Silverado", we get types but here in "Open Range", we get full blooded characters. And of course, even the always excellent Annette Benning has a role worthy of her talents-as a progressive middle aged woman who clearly stands on her own.  There is a slight nod in "The Unforgiven"'s direction in Costner's damaged gunfighter but overall when the gunfight occurs--we're really rooting for these two veteran cowpunchers. Duvall said in an interview that of all the character roles he's played none is more comfortable than that of a cowboy--and he certainly looks like he's born in the saddle (he once boasted that he rode better than John Wayne when he was in "True Grit").  This is one Western I'll be looking forward to in Blu-ray!!</p></body></html>

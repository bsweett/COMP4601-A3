<meta name="summary" content="This Movie Made Me Cry!"></head><body><p>Hard to believe a movie about toys made me feel emotional but that's the strength of the story this movie has! And I haven't felt that way for a long time when I've seen a new film. I may have felt sad or felt an connection to a character before but I've never actually cried (except in Titanic but that's because it was a bad movie, not because it was emotional). Most of the main cast returns except for the late Jim Varney (Slinky) and Joe Ranft (Lenny and Wheezy). While Wheezy, Bo Peep, RC and most of the other toys are gone, Blake Clark takes over as the voice of Slinky, which works just fine for me. If I hadn't known about Varney's death, I never would've caught the difference. New actors include Ned Beatty, Michael Keaton, Timothy Dalton, Whoopi Goldberg and Bonnie Hunt. The animation is brilliant, consistent with the two other films. The story is actually well put together, as I mentioned. The toys (what ones are left), having had the benefit of two films to be developed, are a close-knit family who don't want to be thrown away now that Andy is on his way to college. The toys wind up at a daycare where they are practically torn up. I won't go into too many details but the film has a "Great Escape" feel and near the climax is where I started to get teary eyed. One of the few films to be a "3" and still be consistent in the story and development of what previous films had. A far better "3" movie than Spider-Man, Batman (Forever), Superman, Shrek, Star Trek, Pirates of the Carribean (I can't think of anymore). Go see it, its a perfect end to a good trilogy.</p></body></html>

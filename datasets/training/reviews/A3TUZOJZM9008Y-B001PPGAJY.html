<meta name="summary" content="The way a sequel should be made."></head><body><p>This movie gave you exactly what you wanted. To revisit the characters that you discovered in the first movie. They built this sequel in the precise way that it should have been built. They started with the characters and went from there. So many sequels are just concerned with being "bigger," they never consider that better would be the best way to go.<p>The story focuses on Logan (Wolverine), and the search for who he is. A nice carry over from the first movie. Along the way, we meet new friends and enemies. Not all of whom are what they seem to be.<p>Apparently, we're to believe that Mystique has been able to keep the impression of Senator Kelly going since we last left them. Hey, minor issue as far as I'm concerned.<p>The effects work is again top-notch. The cast makes you believe that this world of mutants could actually exsist. Director Bryan Singer has once again put together a thoroughly enjoyable movie which is arguably better than the first.</p></body></html>

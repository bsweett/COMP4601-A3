<meta name="summary" content="Creepiest Love Story - Ever"></head><body><p>Let me In is an American film based of the Swedish novel, Let the Right One In, which was already produced as a motion picture. The story features two very lonely children who form a special bond over the span of about two weeks; it actually seems like love at first sight, or as close to it has the children are capable. The whole plot revolves around the protagonist Abby - a vampire - and her willingness to allow another to see her as she is. It takes time, but eventually Owen, her meek neighbor, finds himself friends with a blood-sucker.<br /><br />The movie is slow. I think it serves to add a bit more tension and creepiness. Of course, this may set off some viewers. There is very little CGI and the special effects are used to show the story, not to shine a light on the gore The acting is beautiful and haunting, and you can quickly see how the film may end. The cinematography is breathtaking, with the best use of dull color light and empty space to push the loneliness that much further. Predictability aside, I come away from watching the film seeing how two very different people can find trust and love, despite their difference.<br /><br />Do take note of the R rating. The movie puts the spotlight on the 12 year old actors, but this is not a kid's film. For every bit of violence that occurs off-camera there is a bloody scene to follow it up. The film also deals with Owen being abused horribly by fellow students.<br /><br />By far, this is my favorite vampire movie since the Lugosi original.</p></body></html>

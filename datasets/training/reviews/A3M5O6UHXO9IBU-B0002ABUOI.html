<meta name="summary" content="Meritricious and depressing"></head><body><p>It's difficult to give a review of a film that's just spent a couple of hours spitting in your face and telling you there's no hope, other than to say: message understood. The pregnancy story line was particularly cynical.<p>The photography was the usual 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigations' garishness that's currently in vogue, and I wish it wasn't.<br />Character action was jarring. The young security guard and the girl who liked the dog seem to have become an item at one point, but God knows when. Editing is frustrating and counterproductive. There was a particularly odd jump cut when they left the gun shop.<p>Ultimately, George Romero just had that indefinable auteur ability to give his original an inner life. He makes you interested in his characters and has an earthy, blue collar sensibility. Deciding against a bleak ending, the final lines of Romero's film make the picture.<p>This remake is strictly business.</p></body></html>

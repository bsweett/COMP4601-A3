<meta name="summary" content="A must see film!"></head><body><p>The setting for this movie is a dusty southern town in Alabama during the depression and is shot through the perspective of a child's eye. Mr. Gregory Peck does a superb job of playing a southern lawyer who defends a black man who is accused of rape by a white woman and her father. There is no question as you watch the movie of two things; the outcome of the trial and the fact the man is obviously innocent.<br /><br />In this movie we have a great example of a man, Gregory Pecks character, setting a good example of a parent and of being a good member of a community. He instills good values in his children, shows tremendous courage and strength of character. He teaches that you cannot judge a person until you can see the world through their eyes. He is a peerless man, in that everyone is his peer. This is a film whole families should watch together.</p></body></html>

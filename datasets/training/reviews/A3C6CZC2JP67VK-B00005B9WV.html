<meta name="summary" content="This film may not Please all but it is Pure Magic."></head><body><p>Some people here cannot see the beauty of things even when it hits them in the face. Ang Lee has said he has always wanted to make a Wu Xia film and he did, he brought sophistication and strong production values which, while not uncommon in mainstream Chinese cinema, was less common in the martial arts or Wu Xia traditions.<br /><br />Make no mistake; Crouching Tiger is a beautiful, beautiful movie. The colors are rich and the movements are balletic. But unlike lesser imitations, such as Hero, it is much more than that just stylish production and mesmerizing action. Most films (Western or Eastern) have a rigid plot against which characters move. At worst the characters become ciphers; they advance the story by making choices regardless of whether these choices are in keeping with their character. Crouching Tiger, like the best of cinema, has dynamic characters whose internal struggles advance the plot. The dog wags the tail, not the other way around.<br /><br />Some critics have suggested that the characterization is quite slight. I think this just demonstrates the high standard to which they were prepared to judge this film. Ang Lee perfectly marries action/adventure with drama. The results may not please purists from either camp, but for the rest of the audience it is pure magic.<br /><br />In many ways, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is pure Wu Xia. But it has also re-invented the genre and given it artistic credibility. The greatest joy of the film is watching great Hong Kong stars like Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh being given characters with depth - and watching them fill the screen with their performances. The film also benefits from great performances from Zhang Ziyi and a very under-rated Chang Chen.<br /><br />Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the best artistic films I have ever seen and I would recommend anyone, whether or not they are interested in Kung-fu movies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Clint's Third Masterpiece"></head><body><p>By my reckoning (and as of this writing), this is Clint Eastwood's third masterpiece as a director and star.<br /><br />The first two were "Unforgiven" and "Million Dollar Baby".<br /><br />What's Clint's secret to making such outstanding films?<br /><br />Simple -- he doesn't give a fig for what some studio suits think will be commercial.  Instead he looks for a good script.<br /><br />The script for "Gran Torino", like U and MDB, is simply impeccable.  Yes, it's filled with vulgarity and racist language such as you may never have heard onscreen, but that doesn't diminish its command of story and character.<br /><br />The truth is, I wasn't very keen to see this movie when I saw the commercials.  Ho hum, Clint playing another crusty old codger.<br /><br />But then I saw an available copy of GT at my local Redbox kiosk and took it home.<br /><br />Like MDB, the film gets under your skin, and it had me bawling like a baby through the last half hour and crying some more the next day.<br /><br />To say this film is surprising and deeply moving is an understatement.  If you like great movies, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.<br /><br />I have deducted one star just because of the paucity of special features on the DVD -- no director's commentary, no behind-the-scenes making-the-film featurette, just some stuff about cars.<br /><br />I hope that this deficiency will be rectified soon with a better Collector's Edition...  The film certainly deserves deluxe treatment.</p></body></html>

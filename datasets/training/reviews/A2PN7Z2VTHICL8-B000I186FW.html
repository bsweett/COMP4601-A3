'V For Vendetta' plays off the Fawkes legend, bringing it into the future with a sane and cultivated hero who hides behind a mask.<br /><br />'V' (Hugo Weaving), as he identifies himself, has been a victim of the oppressive political overthrowing of a free government, and decides that revolution and death are the only answers to the world's problems.  Despite the dark sound of his schemes, it makes sense in the wake of the current leader's greed and incompetence.  Just before his first message to the government, he rescues Evey (Natalie Portman) from a savaging from being out after curfew.<br /><br />'V' and Evey meet up again as 'V' takes over a public broadcast, and this time Evey help him in return for his kindness to her.  'V' then takes her to his underground hideout to keep her safe for one year, until next November 5th when he plans to carry out his designs for a new government.  When Evey gets away from 'V', he doesn't stop her.<br /><br />But neither 'V' or the government are through with Evey.  Evey becomes a prisoner and is tortured, emerging a stronger person from it.  Lots of secrets are revealed at this time, Evey's torturer, 'V's reasoning, and other sideline plots that were boring and belonged in a movie like 'Sleepless In Seattle' rather than 'V For Vendetta'.  'V' plans on bringing Evey in on his little November 5th celebration, whether she likes it or not, but not until he has taken care of his own personal business.<br /><br />'V For Vendetta' could have been a great movie if they had stuck to a darker vein and left out all the distracting touchie-feelie moments.  About the middle of the movie, where the 'emotional' aspect really takes off, is where I got lost, and bored, and began to see this film as a passing bow to the movie-rating God.  I would rather have seen 'V' more as a John Creasy from 'Man On Fire' than a sap who gives up his cause.  Perhaps the producers were a little too frightened by 911, thinking "terrorist" rather than "revolutionist", but because of the wishy-washy convictions of 'V' it simply turned into a sappy movie with a few scenes of excellent knifework and some stylish photography.<br /><br />My recommendation is to rent first, and make up your own mind.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

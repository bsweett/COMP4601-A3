The title refers to diamonds mined in African war zones and sold to finance conflicts, thereby profiting warlords and diamond companies worldwide. The film depicts many of the atrocities of this war, including the rebels' amputating people's hands to discourage them from voting in upcoming elections (!). Yes, this is shocking, but as the characters say in the movie: TIA. That is, "This is Africa."<br /><br />The story involves Rhodesian Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man with a haunted past who has made himself a key player in the business of conflict diamonds. Amidst the extreme political unrest he meets the beautiful Maddy (Jennifer Connelley), an American journalist who actually cares about what's happening, and Solomon (Djimon Hounsou), an honest African fisherman whose son has been taken by the rebels to be brainwashed and fight for their cause. Archer's sole interest in Solomon is that the fisherman knows were a huge blood diamond is buried, which could be Archer's ticket out of Africa.<br /><br />I'll be perfectly honest with you, I didn't know anything about this civil war or `blood diamonds' until seeing "Blood Diamond," so the film is successful just by being educational.<br /><br />Although the story takes place in Sierra Leone (coastal northwest Africa) the film was shot in Mozambique (coastal southeast Africa) and South Africa. Regardless, the locations and cinematography are excellent, as is the score.<br /><br />Although the story is only moderately engaging and moving, the acting by the principles is great. We are treated to an interesting moral conundrum with Archer. Will he selfishly steal the blood diamond or keep his word and split the profits with Solomon? Will he continue to justify his part in perpetuating the problem of blood diamonds or will he risk his life by unveiling what he knows so Maddy can get the news out? Dicaprio is notable in the role. But the best character, by far, is the undefiled Solomon; the film successfully makes the viewer cheer for him and his cause.<br /><br />The film runs 143 minutes.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: This is a solid political thriller and educational to boot.<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></body></html>

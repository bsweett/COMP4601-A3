<meta name="summary" content="Well done horror film is laced with both big scares and subtle ones"></head><body><p>I remember generally liking "The Ring" when I saw it in theaters, but thinking that it was somewhat sketchy and choppy.  I liked it better on DVD, realizing that the film itself is meant to be almost as surreal, nightmarish, and dreamlike as the short videotape that troubles everyone during the course of the story.  To that end, everything isn't neatly explained, as the movie is mainly about imagery and mood than linear, coherent story telling.  I should add, though, that I agree with other reviewers here that if you watch and listen closely, you are given everything you need to get a satisfying sense of what's going on.<br /><br />Also worth a look on the DVD is the short companion film by director Gore Verbinski that delves deeper into the events of "The Ring".  In actuality, the short film is essentially the movie's deleted scenes, intercut with shots from the scary videotape.  But it's all done quite skillfully, and it gives you more details about the main characters, as well as some surprising fates to characters we only saw for a scene or two in the movie's final cut (for example, there was originally a good bit more with the guy who rented out the cabin to the teenagers).  Also fun to see is a short trailer to the original Japanese horror film, "Ringu", of which "The Ring" is the American remake.<br /><br />Let me conclude my throwing some kudos to Naomi Watts, who gives a subtle, nuanced performance in "The Ring", yet also knows when simple terror and blood-curdling screams are the things that are called for in certain scenes.  She's great to watch here.</p></body></html>

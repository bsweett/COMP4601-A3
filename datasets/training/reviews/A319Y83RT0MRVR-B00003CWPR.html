Was it worth two years? Probably. Was it worth the wait? Not really. Does it deserve to be the last effort of the great late director? Unquestionably.<br /><br />As the plot of Eyes Wide Shut unfolds, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman struggle to attract the audience's attention. They attentively invite the viewer into their fantasy world, in which dreams might be reality and the reality of one single night becomes a long unforgettable dream.<br /><br />As good of an actor as Tom Cruise is in this movie, Nicole Kidman manages to steal the show from him. The scene during which she reveals to her husband how she would have easily given up everything: him, her daughter, and her life for a naval officer is a powerful combo of her performances in the critically acclaimed To Die For and the Broadway play Blue Room. The only flawed scene for Kidman as Alice, an ex-gallery manager, who is currently unemployed, is the sequence where she tells her husband she had a terrible nightmare. Her sobs are unemotional in that scene and it does not come out as strong as the rest of her performance.<br /><br />The famously feared orgy scene is indeed peculiar. It captures the viewer attention, but is it really needed? That scene serves little purpose in conveying the true message of the thin line between imaginary and real life. The entire scenery inside the rich mansion, where the orgy scenes take place, where the masked men pray on hookers, is fantastic regardless of the controversy of its necessity.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick, a master of filmmaking, gives an imaginary twist to marriage, dreams, and reality of life. But once the viewer exits the theater, he or she is at loss of words and the thin line between the dream world and the reality disappears. Such effect is indeed Kubrick's last legacy.</p></body></html>

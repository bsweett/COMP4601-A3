<meta name="summary" content="I don't understand all the negative reviews"></head><body><p>I missed Spiderman 3 at the theater and had to wait for the home video release. During that waiting period, I read many reviews and listened to the opinions of family and friends, most of which seemed to be negative or, at least "not as good as the first two".<br /><br />I wasn't expecting too much when I popped the disc into the player, but I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did the movie sport fantastic special effects and some well-choreographed fight scenes, the story had tremendous DEPTH.<br /><br />Unlike many "superhero" films, the Spiderman series focuses on the psychological aspects of the characters rather than epic fight scenes and flashy costumes (although the Spiderman movies DO offer that as well - you get the best of both worlds). The character developement is what gives these films substance and makes them more than just eye-candy.<br /><br />Brilliantly done.<br /><br />I must say that I enjoyed this film more than Spiderman 2, but not as much as the first Spiderman. Yes, there were multiple plot threads and more than one "villain", but so what? The story comes together quite well in the end and left me wanting more.<br /><br />I, for one, am looking forward to Spiderman 4.</p></body></html>

I brought my daughter of four years to check this flick out.  I didn't mind doing this since I've enjoyed almost all of Burton's films.  The story, though somewhat garish, is a simple case of mistaken intentions.  Johnny Depp's character, Victor, is so nervous to get married to a young woman named Victoria (Emily Watson) that he fumbles his lines during the rehearsal.  Embarrassed after a clumsy series of events, he runs out into the forest to practice his lines.  While going through the motions, he inadvertantly awakens a corpse bride named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter).  She thinks he is intending to marry her and takes him as her husband.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, we learn that Victor does have feelings for Victoria AND he feels sorry for poor Emily.  We also learn that there is a dark villain with alterior motives using Victor's misfortune in his favor.<br /><br />The characters are all quite wonderful, especially since they are voiced by the likes of Christopher Lee, Joanne Lumley, Richard E. Grant and Tracey Ullman.  The humans, in typical Burton fashion, live in a dull world of greys and blacks while the dead are having a vibrant and colorful party down below.  The addition of Scraps the dog was also fun, especially for the children.<br /><br />The set design was brilliant.  I have no complaint there.  The stop-motion animation was perfect and at its quirky best.  Notice the name of the piano manufacturer on the front of the piano when Victor and Victoria first meet.  It reminds everyone where all of this stop-motion animation began.  Burton definitely knows who deserves credit and he makes it clear on the piano.<br /><br />My only real complaints are that the songs in the film felt uninspired and the story seems torn between being a children's folktale and a comedy.  There were times during the film that I caught myself checking my watch.  There were also times when my daughter got a little antsy in her seat and wanted to explore the theater.  It seems like it would have been a wonderful children's tale, but it takes the storyline almost too seriously for children to really enjoy it.  Even the scenes with the dancing skeletons became quite ho-hum after awhile.  As far as adults are concerned, once you adjust to the wonderful, stylized look of the film, you're left wondering when this film will get funny or at least a little silly.  In short, Burton seemed to interested in making this BOTH an adult and children's flick.  Plenty of other films make this work, like "The Incredibles" and "Sky High."  Unfortunately, Burton tried just a little too hard.<br /><br />In closing I have to say that this isn't a bad film, it just gets a wee bit boring for the kiddies and the oldies while it attempts to attract both at the same time.  Brilliant scenery, full of atmosphere, but a dull storyline make "Corpse Bride" worthy of three stars.  I'd rent it or check it out at the discount theater (like I did) before buying it.</p></body></html>

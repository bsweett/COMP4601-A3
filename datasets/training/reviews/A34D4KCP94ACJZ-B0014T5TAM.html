<meta name="summary" content="Profoundly Sad and Visually Stunning"></head><body><p>I suppose Ian McEwan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0099429799">novel</a> was memorable enough that I suddenly looked forward to seeing it on film, but it surprised me when I realized how attached to the story I was when the film jogged my memory a bit.  That is a pretty big compliment to the movie of course.  It's a great novel and an interesting story.  The ending hit much harder on paper than it did on film but that is a nitpicking.  Atonement, as a film is absolutely gorgeous.  The art direction, the cinematography, the costumes, the music, and the actors all look and sound amazing.  Young director Joe Wright makes films with the sensibility of someone in the twilight of their career.  His team captures remarkable images over and over again, all the while weaving this tale with great efficiency.  I didn't see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1ZBGS">Pride & Prejudice</a> but given that many of the same talent was present there, I'm going to give that film a shot.  Joe Wright has more than solidified himself.  There is no doubt in my mind that this guy knows how to make movies.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the story, Atonement is broken out into four parts.  The first part follows Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), a 13 year-old girl from a rich English family with two older siblings.  She wants to become a writer.  She has an older sister named Cecilia (Keira Knightly) who is in the midst of falling in love with their housekeeper's son Robbie (James McAvoy).  Some miscommunication and some meddling interrupt their budding relationship suddenly and that incident's repercussions become the center of the story thereafter.  The second part moves forward four years where Robbie is in the military during the Second World War.  Briony (now played by Romola Garai) and Cecelia are both nurses for the war.  The third part focuses on Briony's experience as a nurse and eventually how she reconnects with Cecelia and Robbie.  The fourth part of the film meets Briony (played now by Vanessa Redgrave) as a successful novelist in her 70s who is terminally ill.  Overall, each section is certainly true enough to the novel from what I can recall, but then again I read it seven years ago.  Some details are missing that may not have been easy to include but they are mostly there in spirit to satisfy those who loved the book. One detail was left out that had me a bit perplexed, but the film was too good to not find forgiveness.<br /><br />It is hard to express how sad this story is without giving away significant spoilers but rest assured it is a powerful story and the film succeeds in that transition quite effectively.  A lot of credit must go to the screenplay from Christopher Hampton who won an Academy Award for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00015YV4K">Dangerous Liaisons</a> and although only nominated here he delivers something of equal quality with Atonement.  There are also some shots in Atonement that are absolutely unforgettable, in particular the lengthy sequence where Robbie experiences the Dunkirk Evacuation.  It is one long single shot that must've required immense coordination from the crew and extras.  In and of itself it is a special achievement and it doesn't come off as unnecessary or intentionally flashy regarding the team's technical prowess in any way.  It is also hard not to mention the performances, which are all good and the leads are actually great.  Keira Knightly should definitely be taken very seriously as an actress and McAvoy really stands out to me for the first time. Atonement is certainly a successful adaptation of the McEwan novel but it is also one of the best films of 2007.</p></body></html>

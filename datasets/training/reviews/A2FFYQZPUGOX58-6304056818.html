I consider its picture quality as excellent (4).<br /><br />The picture quality for the Blu-ray version is the same.  When watching it, there were moments when I thought it might show a tiny bit more detail.  To make this an objective evaluation of its resolution versus the older DVD version, I picked out two scenes with difficult-to-resolve detail.<br /><br />In Dr. Morbius's study there is a blackboard.  Upon it he has chalked a diagram of the enigmatic pointed arches, Einstein's famous energy equation, other equations with possibly alien mathematical operators and symbols, and a drawing of the celestial sphere marking altitude and azimuth of something.  On this last item, there is a word written in capitol letters:  on the DVD, it is unreadable;  on the Blu-ray, it reads, "EQUINOCTIAL".<br /><br />In the chamber with the plastic educator, there are several blue panels in the distant background behind the educator.  In the scene where Doc Ostrow is seated at the educator:  on the DVD, the panels have no detail;  on the Blu-ray, the panels are perforated like a pegboard.<br /><br />If you want the best possible resolution, then this Blu-ray is it; however, since the differences are so minute, I suspect most will be satisfied with their DVD version.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is outstanding (5).  Its story has mystery and an ample supply of wonder.  Visually, the scenes on the surface of Altair-4 are believably alien.  And once you have heard the eerie soundtrack; you will never forget it.</p></body></html>

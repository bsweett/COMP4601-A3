<meta name="summary" content="Bastille Day Explained...NOT!"></head><body><p>OK got the opulence and decadence with the Versailles deal...and the musak was just one major annoyance to deal with...I have no clue why the dialogue was such a mystery, editing process, script, writer problems...how could you possibly as a serious director solicit such poor performances from decent actors??? As a serious student of French history of course I would be dissapointed with this cursory review of fashion...sympathies for young royals and well I will give Sophia credit for citing how Thomas Jefferson and Benny Franklin ZERO credit for getting the funds for the Revolution b/c these folks were too wasted to fight otherwise...Tommy just wanted to see the gardens and have checks signed...I feel very bad for France now that they payrolled our success and then sequel into famine...apologies for any France hating...but DAMN what a waste of talents!!! Imagine she will dissapear into ether with this less than zero dimensional effort...but oh, kewl shoes sweetie!!!</p></body></html>

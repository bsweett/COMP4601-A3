And he does loop-de-loops around L.A. for six hours, and nobody notices, you know?<br /><br />So the real question is this: if a hitman gets gunned down on the LA metro-rail, and nobody hears him die, does the movie really stink up the joint?<br /><br />The answer is: definitely yes. The fact that Michael Mann produced this dog, which has made-for-TeeVee written all over it, is astounding, perplexing, and more than a little sad.<br /><br />If you haven't been hiding in a cave above Kabul for the last three years, then you probably know the preposterous premise behind Collateral's wafer-thin plot: hitman (Tom Cruise, with ugly grey flannel suit and ugly silver hair) blows into town with list of victims, hires cabbie (Jamie Foxx, who tries manfully to fake a working man) to take him to Points A, B, C, D and E.<br /><br />Never mind the stupidity of the premise: what professional hitman, ferried in by Colombian druglords to slaughter the witnesses in a major federal sting, is gonna trust his precious, deadly mission to the hands of some random schmo he picks up at LAX? Let's go by the numbers, alright?<br /><br />1) Every professional hitman works hard to blend in to the scenery by frosting his hair silver, wearing Agent Smith-style refracting wrap-arounds, and donning a dress-to-impress grey suit---especially in LA, where business-formal is defined by the length of your Bermuda shorts;<br /><br />2)Every professional hitman in LA with a high priority job to do hires a cab to ferry him to his destination. Because, you know, cabs are the---ummmm---most efficient way to go if you're carrying off a major hit and want no witnesses. Right.<br /><br />3) In a major federal drug trial, none of the witnesses, let alone the prosecutor, are provided with even the most rudimentary police protection, even when it's evident someone is bumping them off one by one.<br /><br />4) LA Federal buildings have just one crummy security guard, even on the eve of a major trial involving a Colombian drug cartel.<br /><br />5) If you're a high-profile international assassin, it's a great idea to leave all your critical assassin files locked up in a big obvious black briefcase that you dangle around in front of your hijacked cabbie and anyone else he thinks of tossing the thing to.<br /><br />6)If you're director Michael Mann, you're obviously too successful to worry about choreagraphing a coherent, visually compelling action sequence in the dance-club "Fever". Far better to just let things go, in random chaotic fashion, for about 10 minutes, and then call it a rap. Oh yeah, and did I mention? If you're a federal witness on the eve of a major Drug trial and you hear gunshots and the screams of the dying in a club you're chowing down in, it's better just to ignore it and keep eating sushi. Maybe it will go away.<br /><br />7) If Jada Pinkett Smith gets hired to do what would amount to a three-second throwaway role at the start of a flick, it must mean she's coming back for seconds. Or that she's tied into the plot in a big way. Right? Right?<br /><br />8)An expert shot will always miss the hero in a totally unpopulated LA subway terminal, but the hero will always be able to bring down the baddie with one lucky shot.<br /><br />9) When you run out of interesting dialogue/expositions, following a cab using an aerial shot of LA always helps. It lends, like, you know, credibility, man. Big City stuff. Word.<br /><br />10) When chartering a cab for your hit, it's always a good idea to shoot your first victim so he flies out the window and does some major hood and windshield damage to the cab. That way the cops know who to look for.<br /><br />Aside from one scene---a nasty little set-piece with a jazz trumpet player, which ends with a brutal little coda---I've seen all of "Collateral", any of "Collateral", on about 1000 TV-cop shows over the last decade. Everything here has been done, done better, a million times before.<br /><br />Move along folks---there's nothing to see here.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

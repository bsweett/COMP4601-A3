<meta name="summary" content="Possibly Mel Brooks' Best Film"></head><body><p>Thirty-five years later, this film still provides a ton of laughs.  It's always great fun to watch.<br /><br />It's always good to see the late Marty Feldman, too.  His face was hysterical and perfect for this film. In fact, he, along with the camera-work, really make this film one to watch and enjoy multiple times.<br /><br />Teri Garr was at her best and never looked as pretty as did in here. Add in the great talents of Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Gene Hackman, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, etc., and you have a memorable movie with a lot of memorable scenes.<br /><br />Looking at the Frankenstien "monster" in a tuxedo or sitting up in bed with a cigar reading "The Wall Street Journal" are just a few of the outlandish scenes, along Wilder entering the mansion commenting on the "nice knockers."<br /><br />Kudos, also, for Mel Brooks having the good sense to film this in black-and-white. It may have been his best film, although "Blazing Saddles" would give it a run for its money. My only complaint was Wilder's constant yelling, which can give you a headache after awhile! Still, this has to be considered one of the best "comedy classics" ever.<br /><br />I was pumped to hear this was now available on Blu-Ray and that will be the next format of this movie I'll see it on, although reviews are mixed on the quality of the BD.</p></body></html>

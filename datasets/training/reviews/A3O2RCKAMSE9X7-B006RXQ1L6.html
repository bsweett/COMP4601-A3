<meta name="summary" content="Chicago = Music + Spectacle + 15 Minutes of Fame"></head><body><p>As one who is a big fan of the Busby Berkeley musicals of the 1930s, I appreciate the slam-bang musical that is CHICAGO. Director Rob Marshall has chosen Al Capone's Chicago as the backdrop for a musical based on a series of court trials of otherwise good women who kill their cheating or otherwise abusive spouses. Catherine Zeta-Jones is Velma Kelly, a brash-talking brunette who kills her sister and husband for having an affair and, without missing a beat, goes back to work singing and dancing up a storm.  Watching her perform is Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart, who has just plugged her own lover for lying about a promise to introduce her to a talent agent.  While all this shooting is going on, the details of this dancing duo's past is recounted in the oddest of ways.  Director Marshall slips the viewer in and out of reality by superimposing song and dance routines that highlight the details of their respective cases.  These routines are magnificent and quite carry the viewer along with their sheer kinetic energy. Queen Latifah is the dyke prison guard known as Momma, who has her own show stopping tunes.  Richard Gere is the sleazy lawyer Billy Byrne who not only defends Zeta-Jones and Zellweger, but also brags about his never having lost a case.  By the time the closing credits roll, the viewer learns how he has managed that little trick.  The entire film is an opulent non-stop ensemble of song and dance that masks a core of blatant nihilism.  It is no coincidence that Capone's Chicago is the setting.  Few cities in American history had been as criminally wide open as Chicago.  Capone was but the tip of moral vacuum iceberg through which nearly every character in the movie is more flawed than one cares to see initially.  Zeta-Jones kills two people, and her superimposed song routine brags that they had it coming.  In prison, she establishes that she is at the top of the inmate pecking order with a barrage of insults to the newly arrived Zellweger, who proves, in turn, that she can give as good as she gets by learning the ropes of the court hustle spectacle from her sleazebag lawyer Gere.  In fact, the difference between Zeta-Jones and Zellweger shrinks as the movie progresses, until by the end, except for their divergent hair styles, they are joined at the hip.  Gere warns both that fame in Chicago is the most fleeting of ephemera.  His warnings come so often that they form a subtext that suggests that even in the raucus world of show business, the end justifies the means.  I wonder that after having seen and heard the smashing tunes that form the bulk of CHICAGO, did the viewer ever think of peeking under those tunes to see whether any basic human values got trampled on.  I know that I did, and the cumulative glitz and hoopla that mesmerized me for two hours suddenly seemed crudely tarnished.</p></body></html>

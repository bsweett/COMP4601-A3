<meta name="summary" content="A Good Film, But Not the Best Sports Movie"></head><body><p>When comparing sports films, some might be able to see why I gave this movie only three stars. But I'm also basing my rating on more than just previous film success weighing in against this one. There were good and bad portions of this production that stabilized my review at three stars, too.<br /><br />Since I'm an optomist (mostly), let's start with the good:<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton was excellent, as always, in his main role as coach Gaines, as was Lucas Black as quarterback Mike Winchell. Both played believable characters and showed the stresses put onto their shoulders by family, friends, and the obsessive townsfolk.<br /><br />I also enjoyed Derek Luke who played Boobie Miles, the #1 running back for this little East Texas town. He rules the playing field until fate strikes him down ...and then the team has to become a real team, relying on the whole and not the individual.<br /><br />But there were some problems with other aspects of this movie that soured its possible five star glory.<br /><br />Most notably was Tim McGraw's character, who played a washed up drunken father who'd won a Texas State Championship ring during his formative high school years. Initially, I didn't have a problem with Mr. McGraw's performance as he aggressively taunts his son, trying to make him become the "perfect" player. He's not a very nice character, and I think that's the way it should have stayed. But the ending tried to candy-coat him and his son's relationship, and that made the entire portion of Mr. McGraw's portrayal unbelievable. At least it did that for me.<br /><br />I also feel that the David and Goliath battles have been overdone in film noir (ad nauseum). Although some of them (see below) are adequate to the situation being filmed, I felt this movie went a bit over-the-top.<br /><br />I've mentioned other famous sports films that I feel are much better than this one, and will probably hold up better over time. #1 among them is Hoosiers, the infamous Indiana basketball movie staring Gene Hackman. #2 would be Raging Bull ('nough said). #3 would be Rocky (the original Rocky, not the sequels). #4 is the lesser known Mystery Alaska, which I found to be extremely funny and heart-warming.<br /><br />I'm sure some reviewers out there have different favorites, and when compared against this film, I'm sure they might see how this one was quite a bit weaker than their other coveted sports movies.<br /><br />That's how I see it anyway ...</p></body></html>

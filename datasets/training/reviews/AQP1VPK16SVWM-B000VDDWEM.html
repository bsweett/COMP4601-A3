<meta name="summary" content="Chances are you'll find this sequel to "28 Days Later" as infectious as the first"></head><body><p>Most sequels are the cud that cattle spit up and chew again before digesting it in their second stomach--a rehash that takes all the best elements of the first film and robs them of flavor. This sequel is quite good at avoiding the cliches that dog most films of this type and the writer/director avoids rehashing the first film taking an original story related to the first and exploring the aftermath of the viral outbreak. The director uses many of the same techniques that director Danny Boyle used on the first to create a vibe of immediacy and reality in the action that we see and expands on this creating a sense of quiet dread.<br /><br />The film follows two children who are returned to a "safe haven" community established by the military in London. It seems that one of the children (Mackintosh Muggleton and Imogen Poots) may have some sort of genetic immunity to the virus which interests of a military scientist (Rose Byrne also in Boyle's "Sunshine"). Their father (Robert Carlyle)survived but their mother may still be out there with the infected. When the children disappear outside the city's safe area to look for their mother they risk infection and death prompting the military to look for the children.<br /><br />We get a commentary track from the director and producer. Deleted scenes with commentary by the director, an animated short that acts as a prequel to "28 Days Later" and one that acts as a bridge between that film and the sequel as well as a multi-part featurette on the making of the film.<br />Fox has done a nice job with the extras. The screener I received suffers from digital compression problems but I suspect Fox will solve those before the finished product hits the street on 10/8 (edit: 10/13as a follow up--the final DVD version released looks just fine).<br /><br />Let's be honest here if you watched the first film and didn't like it or thought it was no big deal chances are you won't enjoy the second film. "28 Weeks Later" doesn't just try to replicate the first film but expand on its story in a meaningful way. The filmmakers are pretty successful in what they try and accomplish with this imaginative sequel. It's not a radical departure nor is it a rehash of the first film. Fans who enjoyed the first film will enjoy "28 Weeks Later" although the characters aren't quite as well drawn as in the original film.<br /><br />Both this film 28 Weeks Later [Blu-ray]and 28 Days Later [Blu-ray]are available in the Blu-ray high definition format as well with similar features. I'd recommend this as it is a entertaining thriller with some fine performances.<br /><br />Remember votes aren't about if you "agree" or "disagree" with the reviewer but if the review was helpful in your decision to watch/buy/listen/read the product listed.

<meta name="summary" content="Road Warrior"></head><body><p>Let me ask you a quick question: is there anything more sickly, nastily vulnerable than a guy and his chick, strangers in a strange land, driving through the night-gaunt countryside in a really unreliable car?<br /><br />It's not so bad by day, of course, but my God, don't those windows feel big and black and cold and exposed when the hungry darkness comes rolling off the fields and empty spaces, presses its hungry mouth up close to the lips of your beloved?<br /><br />So what it boils down to is this: British co-eds Liz and Kristy hook up with laconic but friendly Aussie Ben, and head out across the sere and empty Australian outback for a chummy road trip into the guts of the country's vast, unpeopled interior.<br /><br />So they party, they drink a little too much, they laugh, they flirt, they tell jokes and make plans.<br /><br />The object of their pilgrimage, and their curiosity, is Wolf Creek National Park, the site of a massive crater pounded into the otherwise freakishly featureless flat plain, the result of a massive meteor impact hundreds of thousands of years before.<br /><br />"Wonder why the meteor hit here, and nowhere else?" muses Liz, idly considering the rainswept crater with its dwarfish forest far below.<br /><br />Why, indeed.<br /><br />Maybe for no reason at all. Maybe. Or maybe, as Ben suggests, "maybe it was drawn to something in the Earth".<br /><br />Maybe so.<br /><br />So when our trio get back to their car and discover that it won't start, and their watches have all stopped, and Wolf Creek is rich in tales of drooling terrors drawn from the Stars to this wild haunt of inky darkness---and you start to wonder if our gang isn't about to have a Close Encounter of the Third Kind.<br /><br />And as those lights in the distance, jouncing roughly just above the ground, draw closer---well, turns out aliens are the least of the kids' worries. They're about to have a Close Encounter, alright: a Close Encounter of the Worst Kind.<br /><br />Greg McLean---with only one other indie short to his credit---has captured, on HD digital video and on a shoestring budget, nothing less than the naked, hungry face of Abject Terror.<br /><br />McLean is particularly impish in the way he conjures up his hellish little landscape of death, cruelty, and carnage: the fiend our heroes encounter (John Jarratt, who owns every inch of his role and chews up the scenery and the tourists with equal aplomb) is the very worst sort of predator, one with zero mercy, ferociously cunning, one that hides its black oozing malice beneath a rube's jowly flesh and easy smile.<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention this guy really likes to hunt?<br /><br />McLean has crafted a very precise, clinically merciless, gorgeous-looking monster of a film: it is depraved, and ruthless, and banal, bleak, and nihilistic. It asks no quarter, and in return offers none.<br /><br />It will instantly polarize: you'll be transfixed or repulsed, or both: McLean knows how to find a nasty, fleshy, spongy wound of horror, and poke it, prod it, and then tear it open. Part of the film's pungent, deadly ability to horrify stems, I think, from McLean's decision to contrast the frail mortality of his protagonists against the hard, seamy, craggy infinity of their ancient surroundings.<br /><br />Part of it, no doubt, is the way he makes us voyeurs: we don't want to watch, but we can't look away.<br /><br />And part of it, I'm certain, is the way in which the voyeur ultimately gets served up as victim. And there are, "Wolf Creek" proves, far, far worse fates than death.<br /><br />Watches stopped? Darkness pressed up against the windshield? Lights in the distance, bouncing peculiarly, against the horizon?<br /><br />I'd hope it's aliens, if I were you.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

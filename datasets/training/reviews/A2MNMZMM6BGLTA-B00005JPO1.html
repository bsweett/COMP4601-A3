<meta name="summary" content="Regurgitated Garbage... with a SIDEKICK!"></head><body><p>This movie is just regurgitated garbage from Speilberg and Lucas. It like its lead actor is a tire old worn out mess. And what do they do to spruce up this old hag of a movie? Why they throw in a young sidekick! And who better than to play it but Mrs. Speilberg herself Shia 'I am not really good looking, not really talented, and not really anything special... except to Stephen) Lebeouf! Yipeee!<br /><br />Save your money and rent 1 or 3 and if you want to prove how bad this pile of dung is watch 2 it is even better than this.<br /><br />Harrison Ford? Retire please. You are worn out and  you haven't done anything origional or even good in years. Lucas? Keep sitting on  your big pile of money and keep producing the same two movies over and over and over. Speilberg? Take your girlfriend and get on Death Star and go to Dantooeen forever. This movie is a bloated old worn out mess.</p></body></html>

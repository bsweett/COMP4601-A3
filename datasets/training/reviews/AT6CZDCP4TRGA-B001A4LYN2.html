<meta name="summary" content="Slow and tedious, though well-intended..."></head><body><p>...this is my least favorite Paul Thomas Anderson film (his others which were far, far better: Punch Drunk Love, Magnolia, Boogie Nights).  Technically, it's superb: cinematography, the always-stellar acting of Daniel Day Lewis, score, script, film editing, etc.  However it starts off VERY slow (no dialogue for first ten minutes) and never really picks up because the film is mainly a character study of the workaholic and rapacious oilman Daniel Plainview that DDL plays, yet without any clear antagonists or dramatic tension, other than Eli Sunday, a creepy small-town farmboy-cum-preacher who makes a series of feeble attempts to grab his own piece of the pie, and Plainview's adopted son HW who later becomes estranged from him.<br /><br />Due in large part to the title and to watching Plainview's ruthlessness and greed, I kept thinking this was going to be one of those "chickens coming home to roost" karmic tragedies where you see the main character build himself up obsessively and then, through his own inherent flaws, fall apart at the end.  Instead, Plainview merely plateaus into a kind of deeply entrenched and isolated state of evil by the end---still dominant and a bit more twisted and violent than before, but now an eccentric recluse sort of like Howard Hughes.<br /><br />After some thought it was clear to me that Anderson has made what is more or less a "message movie" very much in the spirit of Upton Sinclair: a full frontal assault on the two most cherished myths in American history---namely, that of the capitalist entrepreneur "self-made man," and of the church being a moral beacon and pillar of the community.  This film provides a blistering counterpoint: Daniel Plainview the oilman is a heartless, obsessive, one-dimensional workaholic who has neither scruples nor humanity; Eli Sunday the charismatic but hypocritical small-town preacher is equally ambitious, manipulative and ruthless but is at heart impotent and pathetic whenever confronted by Plainview directly, and finally destroyed (literally and figuratively) by Plainview at the end.  In other words, we are presented with a very dark vision of business making religion its whore, as much as religion wants to milk business but is too inept to succeed.  Plainview, as the embodiment of small entrepreneur allowed to grow into large scale industrial tycoon, is simply a psychotic beast who eats Sunday for lunch, right along with all the gullible, weak and passive common people (like Sunday's congregation, whose land he swindles from them) whom Plainview systematically deceives and exploits to make his fortune from though they imagine that they are following Sunday.<br /><br />As Phillip Roth wrote in The Human Stain, "Human history is a story of the ruthless and the defenseless."<br /><br />This is a subtle and hard to dispute social-historical analysis, which Anderson's film unfortunately does not do a very good job of communicating clear, in no small part because of how slow and monochromatic it is.</p></body></html>

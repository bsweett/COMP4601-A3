<meta name="summary" content="The Best Movie Of The Year...So Far"></head><body><p>I want to know what the people at Pixar are taking?  They constantly keep releasing amazing visual and smart written movies.  Plus they keep doing movie that are themed around ideas that have never been done.  Toy Story contained talking toys in their own little world.  Monsters Inc. was about a company that hires monsters to scare children at night.  Then theres The Incredibles.  A movie about a family of retired superheros that have to save the world again, fifteen years into their retirement.  And with this entry, Pixar have made their best movie yet.<br /><br />The movie is about superheros, of course, that are forced into hiding when constant law suits are filed against them from people who either don't want to be saved or have suffer heavy financial loss from damaged personal property on behalf of the superheros.  So Bob Parr, a.k.a. Mr. Incredible, is forced to go work for an insurance company, working in a cubicle that is almost the same size as him (I could sense the reference to Office Space).  He is bored with his life and always thinks about the glory days when he was fighting crime and saving the day.  He goes home every night to his family: His wife Helen, Mrs. Elastic, his son Dash, who can run super fast, his daughter Violet, who can make herself invisible and can create a unbreakable force-field, and his son Jak-Jak, who is the only "normal" one in the family.  Occasionally Bob will sneak out with his friend Frozone (voiced brilliantly by Samuel L. Jackson) to go listen to police radio to try to stop a crime.  One day Bob receives a mysterious invitation to go stop an out-of-control robot and a job offer to be a persons personal superhero.  He gets captured by his hirer, Buddy.  Buddy was the president of Mr. Incredible's fan club when he was a kid, and was always ignored by Mr. Incredible.  Now Buddy wants to be a superhero himself, Syndrome.  So Mr. Incredible's family has to send out on a rescue mission to find him and stop Buddy's evil plan.<br /><br />First of all, the graphics in this movie are amazing.  Pizar keeps outdoing themselves with every release.  This movie was by far their best.  The voice talents were very good and believable.  I especially like Jackson as Frozone and Craig T. Nelson's booming voice made for a good Mr. Incredible.  The storyline in this movie was a little more advanced than previous Pixar movies.  This one involved marital problems between Bob and Helen.  The kids were having problems fitting in with the other kids at school.  And of course, a villian trying to take over the world.  Also people died in this movie, which is unprecedented for Pixar.  So maybe this movie leaned a little more to the older kid demographic.<br /><br />Overall this movie was the best I've seen this year.  This movie may even be the best superhero movie that I have ever seen.  Everything is just beautifully meshed together to create an almost perfect movie.  It is visually stunning, voiced powerfully and very smartly written.  I guess my one word review for The Incredibles would be...well, INCREDIBLE.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Babe and Babs Save This Sequel"></head><body><p>I am not a big fan of "Meet the Parents."  I wasn't looking foward to a sequel until I heard the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand.  I knew that these two additions would be a happy addition to the mix and compliment the rest of the cast.<br /><br />The sequel itself is funnier and fresher for some reason.  Its not just a one joke movie, it's more developed.  Hoffman and Streisand are fabulous.  Babs has never been funnier, and I wouldn't be suprised if she gets an oscar nomination.  Hoffman is equally great.  The real scene stealer is a baby.  He steals EVERY scene he's in.  Also the pets steal one scene.  Lotsa laughs abound in this movie.  It is one of the best comedies of the year, and I was pleasantly suprised of how good it was.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Danny Trejo Is Mexico's Answer To Chuck Norris"></head><body><p>While watching "Machete" I flashed back to other films tackling the immigration problem, "The Visitor" and "Frozen River".  What you say?  Isn't this a grindhouse picture? That said director Robert Rodriguez cleverly incorporates themes that are close to his heart into an action extravaganza that has a lot of heart and more than a passing tongue-in-cheek sensibility.  This movie is akin to the first installment of "The Transporter" where social themes are couched in what is essentially an action movie.  The film falls a little short of the classic grindhouse homage that Rodriguez achieved with "Planet Terror".  It's possible that Rodriguez captured the grindhouse ethos so succinctly in that film that he had nowhere to go but down.  One minor quibble is the acting prowess of star Danny Trejo.  Trejo is a fine character actor but when asked to carry the burden of lead he falls a little short.  The scars and pockmarks on his face say infinitely more than anything inherent in his performance.  Not to worry because Rodriguez surrounds him with an expert cast.  Who would have thought of Steven Seagal capable of giving a full bodied performance.  This made a better "trailer" than a fully realized feature.  That doesn't escape the fact that it is a consistently entertaining flick.</p></body></html>

Another in a string of apocalyptic fear-based family films, the cure for cancer has had an undesired side effect and wiped out the human population.  One man and his dog remain to combat this grave twist of events.  As if the setup of dwindling life isn't bleak enough, the solitary life of Smith's character and the daily effort to survive while seeking a cure creates some heart stopping moments and really creepy psychological provocations.  I went into this film assuming Smith would hold his usual action hero poise, and he does to some degree.  While he is a wonderful action hero in his career, Smith is at core a gifted dramatic actor and that talent comes through in this role.  The usual running scenes, blazing fires and such abound, but they are rooted in an emotional backstory that helps viewers to understand the main character's motivations.  In that light the story is very well-rounded.  Viewers receive the action-packed thriller laced with some fairly intense emotional scenes.  Then begins the second half.<br /><br />The scariest part of this film is the deserted streets of NYC.  All in all the film is well done, acting, direction...  but something about it was really off for me, which I can only assume was the writing.  Smith spends a lot of screen time alone and despite the challenge of having to hold the momentum of the story solo, he pulls it off.  I can't in any way fault him for my feeling that the film was incomplete.  It moves very slowly, adrenaline its only initiator of plot movement in some cases.  I do like that the writing showed the main character's struggle to remain sane under such circumstances.  Most often our end of days films focus more on the hero's feats than his assured flaws.  Still, there were such leaps in the plot that I was unconvinced of the direction it took.  The finale, though realistically suited to the story, felt rushed, thus lacking.</p></body></html>

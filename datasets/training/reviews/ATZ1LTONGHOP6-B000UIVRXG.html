In fact, he is so good that he is making his fellow officers look bad and gets "promoted" to a position in the country in order to remedy this situation. However, all is not as it seems in the peaceful country town of Sandford, and pretty soon Sergeant Angel, with the assistance of his partner (Nick Frost), is tracking down a serial killer who is murdering the residents of this town and making the deaths look like accidents.<br /><br />"Hot Fuzz" is written and directed by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, who previously brought us "Shaun of the Dead", stars many of the same actors, and is even funnier than their previous movie. Essentially, "Hot Fuzz" is a parody of action movies, just as "Shaun of the Dead" was a parody of zombie films, but unlike a lot of recent parodies that have been made in the US (such as "Date Movie", "Not Another Teen Movie", the "Scary Movie" series etc), these films aren't made up of a series of recreations of scenes from other movies. Instead, these films parody the conventions and clich&eacute;s of their respective genres, but in the context of an original story. If you look back at some of the earliest parodies, such as "The Naked Gun" or "Blazing Saddles", this is what the creators of these films also did, and this is the way that parody should be.</p></body></html>

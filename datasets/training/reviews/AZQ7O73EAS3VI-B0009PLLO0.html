Simply stupid...but otherwise it has some of the biggest most epic battles of any movie.<br /><br />Cons: Its a BD.....yet it doesnt fit on one disc!? Hmmm maybe it doesnt fit because its really high quality AV....WRONG!!! Terrible VC-1 video with...you guessed it....NO HD AUDIO AT ALL!!!!!!! Just regular DVD quality Dobly 5.1........not even DTS.....no TrueHD, no PCM, no Master audio..nothing. Horrible. SHAME ON YOU!!!!<br /><br />Also Angelina's accent was terrible. Not at her best by far</p></body></html>

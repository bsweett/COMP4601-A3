<meta name="summary" content="LIke the first two in the series, fairly good without being great"></head><body><p>If you want to get at the heart of what keeps all three films in the RESIDENT EVIL series from being very good it is this:  the assumption that surface is everything.  The mark of good movies is the number of subtexts that they generate, but with the RESIDENT EVIL franchise, there is a powerful resistance to subtext.  For instance, even if you want to do an analysis of the tropes that attach to the main character of Alice, you will find resistance at every point.  Why?  Because the film itself has lingered in every frame on surface alone, completely resisting imbuing the film with more than just a succession of glittering images.  There are entire visual sequences that have no function whatsoever but to merely paint a pretty picture.  As a result, human elements are left entirely aside.<br /><br />This obsession with surface and spectacle is unfortunate because Alice is potentially a fascinating character.  Very occasionally the films in the series almost begin to toy with character development, but always pull back immediately after toying with it for a brief second.  At the hand of more gifted filmmakers, Alice could have had the potential to become a poor man or woman's Ripley or Buffy or Max Guevera.  At the hands of only moderately gifted filmmakers, we get little or no sense of her character, no real idea of what makes her tick, utterly no hint of what she wants, and very, very little about how she feels about things.  Milla Jovovich is so gorgeous that she manages to make us forget how poorly drawn her character is.  But the weak writing and poor direction never allows the films to ascend above slick spectacle.<br /><br />These first two movies tell the first two parts of Alice's descent into her own nightmare land.  The Alice in Wonderland imagery is reinforced at several points, not least in the original by naming the Hive's computer The Red Queen.  And in the third movie in the sequence, EXTINCTION, a version of "White Rabbit" by Collide plays over the closing credits.  During these films Alice, who initially suffers from amnesia, first learns from physical memory that she is a surreally gifted martial artist and weapons user, then recalls that she was head of security at the Hive, and later learns that her blood bonds to the virus that is killing everyone else, enhancing her strength, reflexes, and senses to absurd levels.  What keeps the series from being very good is that the films continually focus on what these powers mean for what she can do to the bad guys, never on how it is affecting her.  Contrast this to the way that this would have been done by any of a number of men (and why is it always men -- why haven't women helmed movies or TV shows with female heroes?) like James Cameron, Joss Whedon, Luc Besson, Ridley Scott, or Ron Moore.  Under any of these there would have been as much or more about what all of this was doing to Alice.  But then, all of these writers/directors/producers are more (or at least as much) concerned with the inner as the outer.<br /><br />In short, these are extraordinarily superficial films.  All surface, no depth, no interesting characters (mainly because of no character development).  Having said that, the film does present superior surface.  Once you accept that the films have nothing to offer but sheer surface, you can moderate your expectations and just go with that.  Once I realized that these films would not/could not be more than a succession of spectacles, I surrendered and moderately enjoyed them.  Was I ever truly entertained?  Of course not.  Was I bored?  Not really.<br /><br />This third film in the series is a genuine change of pace from the first two.  The first was restricted to the somewhat claustrophobic locale of the Hive.  The second moved out of the Hive into Raccoon City.  The third moves into the deserts of Utah and Nevada.  Much of the action takes place in a Las Vegas that has been reclaimed by the desert.  I haven't played any of the games so I can't comment on how closely they adhere to game play, but the real influence on this third film is the second MAD MAX film, better known in the U.S. as THE ROAD WARRIOR.  Though Alice isn't as cynical and certainly isn't amoral like Mel Gibson's Max was, like Max she is an unredeemable loner who can only enable others reach the Promised Land, without going there herself.  Unlike Max, there is clearly something that she has to do, namely deal with the hierarchy of the Umbrella Corporation, as well as distribute a cure for the virus that has rendered most of the world's populace zombies.  And if the ending of the film is accurate, she'll be engaging an army of her clones to achieve her goal.<br /><br />There is also one of the best raven attacks since Hitchcock, as a huge flock of ravens, turned flying zombies by eating off infected flesh, attack the convoy of humans led by HEROES's Ali Larter.  This and other scenes set in the ruins of Vegas give this film a visual energy somewhat lacking in the first two.  All in all, the film sustains what started in the original:  providing flashy, entertaining, but ultimately empty entertainment.<br /><br />I will add one last observation.  The three films that make up the RESIDENT EVIL trilogy (soon to be a quartet, with the addition of RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION) easily comprise the most interesting films ever made based on video games.  That would be a more impression achievement if there had been some really good movies based on that source, but it is unlikely for some time that another game will produce such a film franchise.</p></body></html>

An exceptional mystery/drama, the Illusionist has a well-written plot that will earn it a place on many household's DVD shelves. A bright cabinet maker's son with a visionary gift for illusion falls in love with a Duchess. Their young love is discovered and the illusionist is forbidden to see Sophie. He travels the world to further develop his magical talents, and when he meets the Duchess again in Vienna, she's the girlfriend of a cruel, egotistical prince. The prince is already rumored to have killed a woman, so for the two lovers to escape, they must come up with a tightly woven plan. The rivalry between the illusionist and prince ends tragically...or does it?<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Memento"></head><body><p>Ingenious thriller dares to be intelligent and different, and gets away with it. Since the audience sees most everything from Leonard's disoriented perspective, the movie requires more careful attention than your average thriller. Happily, "Memento" is suspenseful enough to command it. Pearce makes an ideal Leonard, a desperate man skirting insanity, but Pantoliano steals the show as the shady, enigmatic Teddy.</p></body></html>

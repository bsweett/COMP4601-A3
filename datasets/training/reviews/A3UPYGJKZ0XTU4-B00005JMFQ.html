<meta name="summary" content="Long, Charming, and Christmas-y."></head><body><p>&quot;Love,Actually&quot; is a feel-good Christmastime collection of love stories  from writer/director Richard Curtis that aim to say, in spite of strife and bad goings-on in the world, &quot;love  actually is all around&quot;. In London, beginning five weeks before Christmas, ten different but loosely connected love stories unfold.  As the Holiday season builds toward its climax, so do the relationships. The newly elected Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) falls head over heels for a member of his staff (Martine McCutcheon) on his first day on the job. A novelist (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese maid (Lucia Moniz) find love in spite of -or perhaps because of- the language barrier. Newlyweds and long-married couples alike discover chinks in their relationships and new possibilities. Young and old discover loss and new love. And throughout the film, the wonderful Bill Nighy plays a curmudgeonly aging pop star who uses every opportunity his new hit single provides him to inject a little sardonic  humor into the holiday cheer.<p>Truthfully,at two hours and fifteen minutes, &quot;Love, Actually&quot; is too long for a romantic comedy. And it's slow in places. And it improves upon viewing during the Holiday season. But it's a charming film with a very appealing -and very large- cast. Sometimes it's a little too cute, but Bill Nighy's Billy Mack character is likely to amuse even resolutely cynical members of the audience. So there's something for everyone. And the love stories are more light-hearted than sappy. &quot;Love, Actually&quot; is fun, light entertainment.<p>The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary, deleted scenes, a documentary on the film's music, a music video for &quot;The Trouble with Love Is&quot; by Kelly Clarkson, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). The audio commentary features writer/director Richard Curtis and actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, Thomas Sangster, and a couple of others whom I couldn't identify. Three of the actors are seeing the film for the first time, so their commentary is very conversational. Director Richard Curtis does mos t of the talking, however, and provides a lot of information. There are 37 minutes of deleted scenes, all of which are introduced by the director. Curtis' introductions and explanations are good, but, unfortunately, the scenes must be viewed one after the other. There is no way to choose what scenes to watch. In &quot;The Music  of Love Actually&quot;, director Richard Curtis talks about the five songs featured in the film and their influence on the script as he was writing it. Captioning is available in English. Subtitles and dubbing are available in French and Spanish.</p></body></html>

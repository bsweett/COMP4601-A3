<meta name="summary" content="Almost 4 stars.... Almost."></head><body><p>I'd almost like to give this movie 3.5 stars...but not enough to upgrade my overall rating to 4 stars. The movie had great special effects and I enjoyed the T-X villain, but I felt so cheated by the ending. I also really felt like Cameron should have done more to bring back Linda Hamilton's character. Paid her more, given her more incentives or just written in a heroic role to which she couldn't have said no. Claire Danes is NOT an action star and, while I think she did okay in the role of action star, the movie was handicapped by her whiney presence along with that of the new "John Connor."<br /><br />What I really hated was how the "Good" Terminator character got sent back... or should I say WHO sent him back. The circumstances surrounding it, etc. I really felt, as I said, cheated by so many things in this movie. It leaves you with a very hopeless feeling of the future, unlike T2 in which the viewer was left feeling incomplete but perhaps in a more positive frame of mind.<br /><br />Not a great way to "end" the series if this is, indeed, Arnie's last foray into the Terminator world.</p></body></html>

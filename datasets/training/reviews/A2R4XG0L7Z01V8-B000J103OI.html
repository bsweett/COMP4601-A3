I bought it on the second day of release, and watched it a few days later.<br /><br />I was disappointed. The start of the film has a couple of montage scenes (good once, but twice?!) and whole chunks of the book are cut out. Meryl Streep playing Miranda Priestly, was so quiet, I kept turning the volume up, but still couldn't hear a word she was saying. It's said Meryl based this on Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry films, but it quite frankly, annoyed the hell out of me.<br /><br />I don't agree with some of the other reviewers who mentioned that the film works better without some of the "duller subplots" from the book. Andy's best friend Lily featured majorly in the book and even had a pivotal role in the finale. So did Andy's boyfriend and her parents. But they're basically forgotten about, apart from a small glimpse of her father. I liked Lily's story in the film, it showed how strong Andy's friendship was, but she gets no more than a couple of scenes, and a couple of forgettable lines. I don't agree the loss of these scenes made for a more "streamlined" film. I actually thought it would have made it better.<br /><br />The first half of the film sticks quite closely to the book, but leaves out the funny moments. The second half more or less goes it's own way, and I ended up losing it, and not really paying it my full attention. There are still some bits kept from the second half of the book, but not enough.<br /><br />The finale of the film is changed as well. With Lily's pivotal role forgotten about, it changes completely, and in a very unsatisfactory way too. I much preferred the ending of the book, but I did think it was good the way you saw Miranda at the end.<br /><br />The only saving grace about this film (apart from Anne Hathaway), was Emily Blunt's scene stealing performance as Emily. She is cattily on target with her portrayal of Emily, a perfect opposite to the wide-eyed innocent of Anne Hathaway. But her storyline gets partly changed as well towards the end, but not in such a major way.<br /><br />Reviewers calling this a comedy are so far off the mark that it's laughable. What did you find funny apart from Emily Blunt's eye-rolls and her witty comments? There's nothing funny about this. As another reviewer mentioned, it could have so been another Princess Diaries - the transformation from "I don't care how I look" to "Wow, don't I look good?" is seen right through the film.<br /><br />If you want to get it, get it cheap, and read the book first. The book is the true gem.</p></body></html>

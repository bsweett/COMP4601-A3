Q'orianka Kilcher has a great part, a part made for a star, and she steps into it with a child's grace, while Colin Farrell and Christian Bale walk over all sorts of tightropes not to look too lustfully upon her child's body, yet still express the mad passion each feels for her at different stages of her life.<br /><br />It's clear than Captain John Smith is damaged goods from the minute you see him in a cage in the hold of the ship, trying to find a few drops of water to quench his thirst.  His first act on native shores is to stand with a noose around his neck, while Christopher Plummer very undramatically sighs and says, "Oh never mind, let's not hang him after all."  I've been reading the new Library of America edition of John Smith's collected WRITINGS and I can sense a discrepancy between the way he depicts himself in his memoirs, and the way the movie treats him.  But that's what the movies are all about, reinventing history, giving it room to breathe.  They really should have a Pocahontas movie in which she is actually the queen of the colony--not just a young girl but a passionate and regal woman with a mind of her own--or maybe they did make the movie I have in mind a long time ago and they called it COBRA WOMAN.</p></body></html>

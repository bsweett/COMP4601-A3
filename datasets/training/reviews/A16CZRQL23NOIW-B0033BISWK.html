<meta name="summary" content="The unchanged human condition!"></head><body><p>An alien vehicle stands over Johannesburg. The Army takes it by assault and so picks up a huge amount of aliens. They decide to confine them into a concentration camp, trying to isolate them from the outer world. But the chosen territory is overcrowded and sordid suburb, where the violence, misery and hunger are everywhere.<br /><br />As the time goes by, this alien community begins to share with this people their way of living and so these aliens become part  of this enormous sector of relegated A horrid environment in which the hopeless is the only certain. The growing tension and the pressure of the public opinion force the Government to find a relative solution: to displace this alien community 200 km. from the city.<br /><br />Wikus van de Merwe is a sympathetic reporter who works out as the commander in chief of the process of dislodging, interviewing the displaced aliens. It's to say the information in plain development. But when he triggers the Pandora's box, the drama will begin for this Government functionary.<br /><br />Nell Blomkamp makes not only an amusing plot with hints black humor, but besides he makes a demolishing critic about the struggling dehumanization, the scandalous process of contamination produced by technological residues and the primitive approach to deal with this curious problem all the way through.<br /><br />Perhaps, the only flaw of the film is the last breadth of sentimentalism that exudes the last sequence of the film which clearly weakness seriously the plot.<br /><br />In sum, more than a smart sci-fi (which pays a deserved homage to "The fly" and a collateral tribute to "Transformers") is an incisive statement about the unaltered human condition.<br /><br />I think to myself if Thomas Hobbes (Leviathan) would be still alive, he would be proud with this release.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

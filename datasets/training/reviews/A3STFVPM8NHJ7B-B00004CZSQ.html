<meta name="summary" content="Its alright"></head><body><p>While shopping for horror dvds, my favorite store had a sale on a bunch of movies. I picked this one up and it sounded like a great film. The movie starts off in a rain storm and in a creepy home. Then a murder which Entertainment Weekly called the most vicious murder scene ever filmed. Ive seen alot of films and I didnt think it was vicious. Then the movie kinda of drags on from there. It has a good atmosphere but never really delivers the goods. It was alright but I probably never will watch it again.</p></body></html>

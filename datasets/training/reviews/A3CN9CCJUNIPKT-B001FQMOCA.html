<meta name="summary" content="It's just not that good..."></head><body><p>This movie was pretty disappointing, and certainly not worthy of the rave reviews it seems to be getting... Now, I'm not one of those people who will write negative rants about movies or actors just because they are popular or win awards... I'm also not writing mean or snappy things just to show how clever I am or how catty I can be, but rather because I sincerely am baffled by the acclaim this film has gotten, and wanted to drop in a few comments that I hope will be helpful.<br /><br />I'm writing this review as a fellow who's been listening to country music since the early '70s, who's written about it quite a bit, played it on the radio for over a decade and thought about it a lot. Johnny Cash is clearly one of country music's great iconic figures, and the story of his courtship with June Carter is a great love story.  No problem there... The trouble lies with the flatness and predictability, the blandness and utterly cliched nature of the storytelling -- everything is telegraphed from a mile away, all the characters and their relationships are thinly drawn and unremarkable, the dialogue is flat and the music fails to overpower or excite.  In short, there's little here that can overcome the difficulties presented by trying to portray such larger than life figures as the Cashes, and while there are little glimpses when Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon look a little like the craggy, unglamorous Johnny and June, never for a moment do either of them project the true gravitas and solemnity of their roles.  Although there is some grand and purposeful cinematography, the film itself feels like it could just as easily have been an ABC after-school special from the '70s.  Seriously.  It's just a cinematically and intellectually weak, facile presentation, sadly unworthy of its subject.<br /><br />And then there are the little things -- for example, we see June Carter writing "Ring Of Fire" at some unspecified time (with co-composer Merle Kilgore nowhere in sight), but we never see the payoff, which is that the song became a collossal hit for Cash in '63.  Similarly, his move from Sun Records to Columbia -- one of the biggest decisions of his entire life -- is glossed over in a split-second image as part of a breezy visual montage.  Then there's the gratuitous insertion of would-be country rebel Shooter Jennings, playing the part of his father, Waylon Jennings, in a scene where Waylon and Johnny become roommates while down-and-out in Nashville.  It's kind of a cute in-joke, son playing the father and all that, except that Shooter doesn't look much like Waylon, and he *certainly* doesn't look like Waylon did in the mid-1960s, when the scene is supposed to take place: Jennings didn't have hippie hair and a beard back then.  He just didn't.  It's lame to present him otherwise.<br /><br />Finally... jeez, louise... couldn't the DVD producers even manage to spell Johnny Cash's daughter's name correctly in the subtitles????  Poor Rosanne!  Oh, well.  I guess the answer is, "it's only a movie."  Can't take it too seriously, right?  [?2006 joesixpack at slipcue dot com]</p></body></html>

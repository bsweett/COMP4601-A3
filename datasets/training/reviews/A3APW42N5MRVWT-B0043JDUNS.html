Functions reasonably well as a stand alone film. Functions very well as a continuation of the build toward the Avengers movie. Avoids the trap of multiplying villains with each sequel. Continues adding depth (though not tremendous depth) to all of the characters. Jon Favreau accomplishes a difficult and thankless task with style and aplomb in continuing this franchise. And I admire his geek-knowledge foresight in giving himself a tiny part in IM1 as the character who eventually marries Gwyneth Paltrow's character. Smooth, buddy, smooth.</p></body></html>

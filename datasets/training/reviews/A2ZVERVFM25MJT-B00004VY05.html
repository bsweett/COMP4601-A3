It basically tells a story set against a futuristic background where ultimate evil is about to encompass Earth.  This is to be conquered by the so called 'Fifth Element' which takes the shape of the thin, red-haired Leeloo.  When she is rescused by an inner-city cab driver we just know that there's got to be a romantic subplot amidst the impressive battle and chase sequences.  The unusual couple soon cross paths with Cornelius (Ian Holm), who alone knows the importance of the fifth element.  Zorg (Gary Oldman) is the man that stands in their way.<p>Whilst this is basically just a pulp plot punctuated by explosions and screaming, it never pretends to be anything else.  There's also plenty of incidental pleasures, such as the extravagant costume designs and an enjoyably light performance from Bruce Willis.  Still, there are several incidental annoyances as well, especially the various outlandish characters that seem to be weird for the sake of it.  When it's giving us character farce with the likeable Willis and cutely effective Jovovich, it's very enjoyable.  Ditto in its impressive action seuquences.<p>This movie never pretends to be anything its not and therein lies its appeal as true blockbuster entertainment.</p></body></html>

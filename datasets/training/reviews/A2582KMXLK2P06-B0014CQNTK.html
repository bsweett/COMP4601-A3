<meta name="summary" content="just a well-rounded quality film"></head><body><p>This is *exactly* the perfect movie for someone like me.  Simple movies like this one, with a relaxing story, and easy to follow twists, all while taking place in a small town.  Admit it, that's why you love movies too :)<br /><br />It was just a lot of fun watching it, and seeing all the popular faces as the story rolled along.  I used to love Arrested Development, and was surprised to see the father and son from that show both playing major roles in the movie, and of course, the beautiful Jennifer Garner, and the best surprise of all, the teenage daughter, who was the lead actrees, named Ellen Page.  She was funny, witty, and interesting the entire time.  I loved her role and expect to see more of her in the future.<br /><br />A VERY good movie.</p></body></html>

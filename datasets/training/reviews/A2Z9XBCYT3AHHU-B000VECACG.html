<meta name="summary" content="a classic from steven spielberg"></head><body><p>For anyone who loves X-files or anything dealing with the arrival of aliens on this planet, this is the film for you! The special effects are awesome and the story is brilliantly written and acted. and while there are government conspiracies, they are not as evil as in X-files. Close Encounters is a beautiful film that asks us to think about many questions dealing with life beyond earth.</p></body></html>

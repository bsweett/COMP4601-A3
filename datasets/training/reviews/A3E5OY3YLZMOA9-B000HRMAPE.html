There're are two types of fans that go see films like this, those who started watching the films and don't care and don't know anything about the original books or show and those that do and are completely loyal. In no way do I show disrespect to the people that loved the show or books because there have been plenty of films that had a great show and it completely disappoints me.<br /><br />My review is mainly for anyone that has seen the first two films or is just looking for a good movie to watch on movie night. I started watching Mission Impossible from the first film and the third installment is much different than the first two films. One big change is that Ethan is married right from the get go and already the film has a much more mature main character who is now living on the safe side. The other big change is that Ethan is no longer an agent is now an agent trainer. The story builds up when Ethan is asked to do a mission to rescue one of the agents he trained, she has been captured by the films villain Owen Davian played by Philip Seymour Hoffman.<br /><br />Ethan accepts but of course he has to make something up because his wife knows nothing about what Ethan really does. Then after the cool scenes of gunplay and new gadgets the heat is on and so is the search for Davian. Ethan really has no choice but to go after Davian himself. When all the elements in Mission Impossible come together it becomes one of the best films I've seen over the summer. A major action change was made because unlike M.I.2 Ethan does only one hand-to-hand fight scene and it isn't much because it's against Davian. One big problem I had was the addition of his wife, which does add more to the story, but for the most part she was annoying. Of course Davian found out about Hunt's wife and used her to get Ethan to steal something called a Rabbit's Foot.<br /><br />I also would have loved to see some more fight scenes, in the last film the movie depended on those great fight scenes and this one steers clear of it period which wasn't needed. The action was amazing from the shootout on the bridge which was mind blowing to the crazy and unbelievable jump from one skyscraper to another in Shanghai to recover the Rabbit's Foot. I wouldn't say that the action was severely limited, if anything just a little and to be honest it had an almost perfect amount of action to keep the viewer interested in the movie. Though Tom Cruise was going crazy around this time I don't think it affected his performance, maybe his fans are ticked but I like this movie a lot. The acting was ok; nothing amazing but good enough to hold the movie up and overall Mission Impossible 3 is definitely a movie worth seeing.</p></body></html>

The cast worked very well together to bring forward the same incredible mix that made "Fantastic Four" the superb franchise it had been in the first place!<br /><br />The CGI for Reed Richards worked excellently...this was the area I would have thought they'd botch up on and make to look unfaithful to what was expected, but it was so incredibly "FF" from the get-go! Too much fun and true to the character.<br /><br />Along with Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis all did remarkable jobs with their characters too...and let's not forget Julian MacMahon's sinister performance as Dr. Doom!<br /><br />The care that went into this production is evident and it comes through in the finished product. I must give credit to all parties involved.<br /><br />As far as the sound and video of the Blu-ray presentation, at 18MB/s and with DTS HD Master Audio it looks and sounds great!<br /><br />If you're into your Marvel Universe, then I so highly recommend "Fantastic Four"! Even those who just like great movies will enjoy this, I believe.<br /><br />I can finally watch its Silver Surfer sequel which came with the special PS3 bundle I got. :)<br /><br />"Fantastic Four" true to its roots, is big production...big story...big fun...very well done!</p></body></html>

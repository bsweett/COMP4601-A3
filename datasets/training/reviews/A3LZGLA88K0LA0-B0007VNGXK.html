<meta name="summary" content="PERL OF A SHOW"></head><body><p>You have to give Ron Perlman credit.  Who else would spend years on a tv show ensheathed in mounds of makeup and then turn around and do it again in HELLBOY?  Well, Ron, you've finally had a box office hit as the star!  Perlman is a good actor to hide in make-up; his voice is rich and tremolous; his eyes expressive, and his movements secure.  In HELLBOY, he uses these talents to bring us a delightfully flawed hero.  In films like this, I should think one could leave behind the concern over well developed characters and credibility.  It's a filmed comic book, for Pete's sake.  It has a lot of intense action scenes; some pretty cool monsters and a talented cast filling out their roles quite well.<br /><br />The CGI effects fit the movie perfectly; whether they set new trends of compare to others, that's really not the point.  They worked in this movie and that's all that really matters to me.<br /><br />I had a great time watching this movie; that's entertainment!</p></body></html>

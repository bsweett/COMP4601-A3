<meta name="summary" content="2 Things"></head><body><p>This film is powered by 2 things, Nicholson's performance, and the creepy atmosphere set up by Kubrick.  I have read the book, and Kubrick certainly deviates from it, but he does create an effective horror that builds nicely.  I can't imagine anyone else being able to effectively pull off the lead role other than Nicholson.  He transitions perfectly from a regular guy into a madman.  This version improves on the audio and adds a few extras.  Worth getting for any fan of thrills.</p></body></html>

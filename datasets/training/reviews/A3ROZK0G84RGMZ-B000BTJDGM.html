<meta name="summary" content="This Is Not A Horror Film"></head><body><p>I know alot of people went to the theater thinking this movie would be another one of those cheap so called horror flicks that we have seen alot in the past 8 years or so but it's not.  It's a much more smarter film.  A Drama/Thriller<br /><br />Both points of view are represented in the movie and you the viewers can decide for yourselves what to believe.  I happen to believe that she was being held hostage in her own body by some unseen unknown evil force.  I know those types of forces do exist.</p></body></html>

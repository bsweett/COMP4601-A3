A hero and actor playing him even worse than Brad Pitt as Achilles.  Over the top violence, stop spearing the horse already.  Ridiculous accents by everyone involved including Jolie.  Oliver Stone needs to get a grip or an editor for his screenplays.  This one was terribly disjointed and very confusing.  The viewer doesn't even like Alexander or anyone else.  Nothing compelling in the film whatsoever.  I would not recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />This was such a bad movie. I wanted to like it, I love the Alexander legends! But it was so sadly poor to be almost pathetic. Angelia Jolie was an utter wooden disaster in her role.  The movie just didn't hang together and the character relationships were lacking. It wasn't at all the rousing epic it was supposed to be.  Too much pomp and not enough circumstance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great audio and video!"></head><body><p>Master And Commander won two Oscar's for its great sound editing and another for cinematography and was nominated for several more including best sound mixing and visual effects in 2004 and there has never been a better way to enjoy it with this release,the standard dvd had great sound to begin with but this is a much higher level.The picture quality is pretty good as well,I'll have to agree and disagree with other reviewers here.Yes Fox most recent blu's have had pretty bad picture quality(AVP2,Hitman,Predator)even Independence Day was a disapointment but having said that there is nothing wrong with the picture with Master and Commander,at times its as good as anything out.I think it has to do alot with the color the film was shot and the general fim source whenever it doesn't look its best.As I look at it right now a scene in the ship within the first 30min.were the two young shipmates bring a model of the enemy ship to the captain I though wow thats as good as anything I got on Blu.Yes the special features are bare but there are two pretty cool things.First there is a map you can look at anytime in the film to see the ship's position relative to the world and second and really good fact track that runs during the film.I'm not big on special features anymore I look more for performance on Blu Ray and this has it with both Audio and Video,finally Fox put out a good one,now they just to work on price's and we'll be ok.</p></body></html>

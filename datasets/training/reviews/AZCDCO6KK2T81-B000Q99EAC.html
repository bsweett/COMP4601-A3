<meta name="summary" content="Rocky Can Still Pack a Punch!"></head><body><p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICM5VM">Rocky</a> franchise is a part of our American culture now.  The original Rocky film went on to win Best Picture and many believe Stallone who was nominated for Best Actor that year only lost because another great actor, Peter Finch, had died that year after filming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNESU8">Network</a> and the award was given to him posthumously.  Stallone over the years turned out some great performances such as in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BMY2N8">F.I.S.T.</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33EG">First Blood</a>,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XALT6">Cop Land</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JZHJ">Nighthawks</a> and we see him return to his roots of great acting in this film.  I would not have been surprised to seem him squeek out a Best Actor nod for this film, but that didn't happen and I think it should have happened.  Regardless, Stallone has proven once again that he can command the screen as actor, writer, and director like few can.  He's no Mel Gibson or Clint Eastwood, but he is, nevertheless, very competent at each task.  He managed a $24 million dollar budget (not bad for a sixth trip to the sequel well), and it earned over $100 million.<br /><br />This latest and perhaps last entry into the Rocky franchise is much better than expected and actually picks up the story in a very believable fashion.  Most sport has-beens typically end up opening a bar or restaurant when their careers are over and tend to tell the same stories over and over again to anyone who will listen.  Rocky is no different here, and like others before him in the boxing industry he feels he has one more good fight in him.  Thus begins a very believable story.<br /><br />In addition, Stallone doesn't forget that Rocky had friends and family who were affected by his boxing life.  Rocky sort of forgets that a bit when he wants Paulie to run around with him and mourn over his losses, forgetting that Paulie had lost a lot himself and he stands in stark contrast to Rocky as he always did and to Paulie's credit, he sees that.  Adding to this, Rocky's son feels he must forever walk in his father's shadow and "you cast a big one" he tells him, but Rocky does appropriately tell him in return," don't blame 'shadows' for not making your own way in the world."<br /><br />This is a thoughtful Rocky that we saw coming in the last Rocky film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000897BC">Rocky V</a>, where he knew he couldn't really fight anymore, but wanted to somehow stay close to the action.  That effort failed when his prot&eacute;g&eacute; in that film abandoned him and the story ended with a street brawl, a place where Rocky has always ruled.  I personally think that that Rocky film failed as his legion of fans hated to see him grow older, but I think it was a clever new direction for Rocky and a logical one and this film follows in that sequel's footsteps; however, we are now more accepting of an aging Rocky as this film opens 30 years after the original did.  Rocky is like your family photoalbum or your old favorite sweatshirt.  He brings up a well of memories that make us feel good, but also saddens us as we realize time has marched on for all of us.  In this film we get to relive similar themes from previous Rocky films that are still important.<br /><br />This film covers similar ground from some previous Rocky films such as the aging fighter who believes he has one more good fight in him and goes the route of an exhibition fight to get it like Apollo Creed did in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GAOGI">Rocky IV</a> against Drago from Russia.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GAO6I">Rocky III</a> dealt with having the "Eye of the Tiger" and overcoming one's fears, both issues the current champion tackles himself.  As already mentioned, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000897BC">Rocky V</a> dealt with what every sports person dreads, retirement.  The interesting thing in this film is how we see so much of the original Rocky film in this last one.  You know it's a swan song here and a beautiful one at that.<br /><br />In the very first Rocky film he isn't concerned with winning as much as still not being looked at as "another bum from the neighborhood" (a quote from the first film).  He doesn't even stay in the ring at the end to hear who won the exhibition fight.  It simply doesn't matter to him.  He already proved long ago that he wasn't a just another bum from the neighborhood; however, in this one he just wants to get out the rage in his heart (over losing Adrian) and that annoying feeling that there is still something left floating in his "basement" (soul) over a life not quite complete yet.  Paulie jokingly responds with, "What?  You don't think you've peaked yet?"  We all laugh with him on that, but understand that even when we've peaked in life, there may still be something burning in us.  Rocky reminds us to not ignore that regardless of our age.<br /><br />In that vein, Stallone smartly wears little makeup to cover his age in this film, even though he still looks very good for 58.  Heck, I wish I looked that good at my current 43.  He does, however, add on some eye makeup to Rocky to clearly show the power behind the beatings he had taken in his career and he does little to shed the extra weight he's put on as we all typically do over time.  Don't get me wrong; I wouldn't want to mess with Stallone one on one no matter what the weight.  He is still in remarkably good condition, but he's obviously aged too.  Age isn't a regret in of itself, but an incomplete or unfulfilled life is.<br /><br />Many are not aware of this, but the original script, to which I have a copy, had Rocky not only losing the fight in the first film, like he did, but also going home with Adrian in a cab.  He rests his head on her shoulder and says "I fought my whole life to be something more than just another bum from the neighborhood and tonight I was.  Boy, I'm tired", and with that Rocky dies in Adrian's arms having fought his heart out, literally.  The producers convinced him that the audience wouldn't accept such a downer ending, so he rewrote it.  Ironically and without giving anything away here, this Rocky ends at a cemetery.  One can't help but feel that as much as we love Rocky and how he so often embodies the common man's struggle to overcome obstacles, we can't stop time.<br /><br />Rocky will live on for generations.  For us older folks, he reminds us of who we once were, wanted to be and might still be and for younger audiences he is an encourager to be all they can be while they can.  In Rocky's words in this final film of the franchise, "Life isn't about how many times you are hit, but how many times you are hit and still keep on moving forward."  In that, Rocky continues to encourage us all.</p></body></html>

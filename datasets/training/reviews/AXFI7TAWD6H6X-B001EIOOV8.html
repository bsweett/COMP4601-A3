<meta name="summary" content="A riveting movie"></head><body><p>"Casino" is one of my favorite mob-related films, right up there with "Goodfellas" and the first two "Godfather" movies. I am also a fan of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci. The dynamic chemistry between both actors really translated well from "Goodfellas" to "Casino". Martin Scorcese is one of the best film directors in the past couple of decades. "Casino" may not have not been a box office smash for Martin but artistically I thought it was right up his alley. I am not a big fan of Sharon Stone but "Casino" is the only movie that Sharon was able to pull off a convincing film role as the drug addict/prostitute Ginger. Granted that the film is well over two hours, time flies by whenever I watch the movie.  Based on gangster Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal and stylistically modeled after "Wiseguys" and "Goodfellas", "Casino" takes the viewer to the humble beginnings of then booking agent Ace Rosenthal who eventually rises through the ranks in the world of gangsters and soon becomes the operational manager of a Las Vegas casino. The film is narrated by both DeNiro and Pesci ala "Goodfellas". One of my favorite scenes is when DeNiro scopes out the hustlers who are trying to cheat the casino out of as much money as they could possibly get. And another favorite scene was when Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) took a pen and stabbed a guy in the beginning of the film. I am not a Don Rickles fan only because I find him to be an obnoxious, loudmouth, unfunny comedian but he was actually pretty good in the movie and that is because he wasn't trying to be funny. As I have stated earlier, I never cared for Sharon Stone but her performance as Ginger was downright convincing. Eerily too convincing perhaps. Frankly Al (Robert DeNiro) should have dumped the twit right away. Ginger was more in love with his money and power than Al himself. I think the problem with "Casino" is that Martin Scorcese tried to capitalize on the success of "Goodfellas" too soon with "Casino". Had he waited a few more years and in between films, "Casino" might have been a box office hit but compared to "Godfather 3", "Casino" is a hit.</p></body></html>

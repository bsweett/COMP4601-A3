<meta name="summary" content="A disappointing sequel"></head><body><p>Mission Impossible III had a lot to overcome for it to be a box office success, and a good movie.  First, Tom Cruise was in the middle of his public scrutiny/Scientology/Nicole Kidman/Katie Holmes public relations fiasco.  Second, this movie was directed by JJ Abrams and came out five years or so after the second, and third, this is a Mission Impossible movie, so it had to live up to certain expectations and fulfill certain elements that fans have come to expect.<br /><br />While entertaining, this movie is not nearly as good as Mission Impossible II.  It seemed like a series of highly complex, detailed missions, each lasting about twenty minutes, followed by five or ten minutes of story or drama, then onto the next big set piece.  You had the rescue of the captured agent, the capture of the bad guy in rome, the bad guy's escape, the theft in China, then the finale.  Each segment went down the same way, the IMF team (Cruise, Ving Rhames, Maggie Q, and another guy) played their parts and looked nice, but in the end, I felt know connection to what they were doing.<br /><br />Phillip Seymore Hoffman plays the bad guy, Owen Davian.  I read reviews where his performance is praised, yet I found it fleeting.  He was only in a few scenes, and not given time to develop as a bad guy.  The rest of the cast was fine.<br /><br />In this movie, Ethan Hunt is in love and about to get married when he gets drawn back into the field by a self-destructing message.  The opening played the catchy, hypnotic theme music, but then the theme all but disappeared by the end of the movie, making me feel like this wasn't a Mission Impossible movie.  To me, JJ Abrams under utilized the Mission Impossible theme and this brought the movie down a bit in my eyes.<br /><br />The story was simple, but lacked the "cool" factor that John Woo's edition seemed to have.  This is an okay movie, and I'll watch the next if there is another one, but I understand now why it didn't rule last summer's boc office.</p></body></html>

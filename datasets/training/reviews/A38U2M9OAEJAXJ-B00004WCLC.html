<meta name="summary" content="Magnolia: a Deeper Look."></head><body><p>I saw "Magnolia" in the theatre in January, 2000. While I wasn't wetting my pants over the film as many critics were, I liked it enough to buy the DVD later that summer. Now that I've given it a recent viewing, I've concluded that "Magnolia" ranks up there with "Doctor Zhivago," "The Piano," and "Gladiator" as one of the most overrated films to hit the silver screen. There's as much to admire as there is to pick at, and while "Magnolia" has great performances and a promising premise, it's a strange step backward for the director who gave us the vastly superior "Boogie Nights." To summarize, 11 people in southern California are somehow united through circumstance, tragedy, or bloodlines. None of the characters are very likeable, and a handful of them are so stupid or immersed in their own angst, you pray they get hit by a lightening bolt to put them out of their misery. The Black characters, all background roles, offer little more than crass stereotypes: the fat and boisterous ghetto woman, the preteen pickpocketing "rapper," and the timid journalist who gets disrespected by a smug, self-help guru (Tom Cruise). Some scenes require you to suspend disbelief to digest fully. How that cop (Reilly) was able to befriend and romance that train wreck of a drug addict without so much as suspecting her condition is beyond me, and for that reason, that subplot failed. And while Paul Thomas Anderson is a gifted and articulate screenwriter, he must have skipped the class in film school that taught dramatic subtlety. The score, while lush and beautiful, gets overempowering for a huge portion of the movie as it tries to underscore the film's dramatic tension. Completely unnecessary. Hitchcock will tell you that less is often more. And the film's bizarre final scene, which aimed to "tie up everything together," was unacceptable and showed that Anderson failed to come up with a way to coherently end the film. And the length? I've seen three hour movies that dragged at a worse pace, but a film like "Magnolia" could have been trimmed by at least one hour. <p>You'd think that by reading the above, I would despise "Magnolia." Quite the contrary. While there are good performances and intriguing moments, I don't think it deserves to be put on such a high pedestal. For that reason, its considerable warts earn the film a mere B- in my school of cinema.</p></body></html>

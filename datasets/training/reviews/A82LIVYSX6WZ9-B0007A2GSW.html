Nelson (The Skulls, Poltergiest), is one of the biggest super heroes around and his wife, ElastiGirl, voiced by Holly Hunter (Thirteen, A Life Less Ordinary), as well. They fight crime where ever they go but soon people dont want super heroes saving their lives anymore and soon they just become not wanted and they all become everyday citizens. 15 years later Mr. Incredible is working at a office company working for with this snotty boss, voiced by Wallace Shawn (Princess Bride, Clueless). What Mr. Incredible's wife doesnt know is that him and his friend, Frozone, voiced by Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill Vol. 2) go out and fight crime. Soon, Mr.Incredible is back in action as he goes to visit a secluded island where there he meets a badguy named<br /><br />Syndrome, voiced by Jason Lee (Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back), who years ago was put down by Mr. Incredible. Syndrome has evil plans ahead. Mr. Incredible's wife and his kids, Dash and Violet soon come to rescue him. Pixar and Disney have done it again creating a fun filled adventure for the whole entire family and it plays off like a super hero movie as well. The characters are enjoyable especially the old lady who creates the super outfits. Elizabeth Pena (Rush Hour) voices the sidekick lady of Syndrome. A winner of incredible proportions though it's fun and exciting it isnt a masterpiece</p></body></html>

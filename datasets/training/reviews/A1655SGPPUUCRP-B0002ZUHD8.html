<meta name="summary" content=""The untold true story that inspired the legend.""></head><body><p>Antoine Fuqua's "King Arthur" manages to suck all of the magic, valor, and mystery out of the much-loved Arthurian legends.  What is left is a dull, dreary, generic action flick in which King Arthur's noble Knights of the Round Table curse, drink, crack crude jokes, and sex-it up.  Being that "King Arthur" has touted itself as "the untold true story that inspired the legend", I was left with the impression that King Arthur's knights were crude, dirty bums that sat around all day; drinking and complaining.  Merlin makes an appearance too as part of a face-painted tribe of barbarians living in the woods.  Can you feel the magic here, folks?<br /><br />This "true story" is bogged down with stilted speeches about how every man is born free and equal and frantic, confusing battle sequences.  And the script?  Here's a sampling of some of the cinematic masterpieces that await you:<br /><br />Lancelot: There is a large number of lonely men out there.<br /><br />Guinevere: Don't worry; I won't let them rape you.<br /><br />Arthur: O merciful God, I have such need of Your mercy now...<br /><br />Lancelot: Why do you always talk to God and not to me?<br /><br />Gawain: The gifts the gods gave me I use in battle or in bed.<br /><br />Galahad: Imagine what a lovely, quiet place the world would be if everyone had their throats slit.<br /><br />Horton: God help us. What are they?<br /><br />Bors: Blue demons that eat Christians alive. You're not a Christian, are you?<br /><br />The acting just don't cut it either.  From previous experience, I realized that Clive Owen's King Arthur and Keira Knightley's Guinevere (who is now a painted pagan prison inhabitant) are supposed to be falling in love, but it is never apparent to the audience until they, predictably, jump in bed together.  And the famous love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lacelot?  Practically nonexistent.</p></body></html>

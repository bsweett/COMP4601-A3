<meta name="summary" content="hate ABBA, hate musicals, BUT WHOA MOMMA MIA ROCKS!"></head><body><p>I only watched this film because the PPV selections were limited and thought....hmmmm,  Meryl Streep how can I go wrong even tho I have a great disdain for musicals and never really understood the appeal of ABBA...wow, was I wrong....the movie despite all the surprising perfomances is carried via the most delicate, insightful and endearing lyrics of ABBA songs which I never really paid much attention to....they I believe are the star performance of the film...the location was unnatural and prolly forced to get one's attention for it's superb beauty and Meryl looks just incredible dressed in that deep blue hue....how fun it was to see her sing and dance like a Ziegfield girl!!! LOL  cracked me up and always a joy to be surprised in life at this point...guess this film works best for those of us who have gone thru lotsa family experiences and whatnot....I spose getting older actually has it perks cuz Mamma Mia will fall on deaf ears for the youngest of viewser methinks...Thank you my dear producers for making this happen..I bet this was a very hard sell even tho Chicago and Dreamgirls did well...</p></body></html>

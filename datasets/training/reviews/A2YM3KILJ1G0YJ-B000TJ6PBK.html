<meta name="summary" content="John Cusack scared senseless"></head><body><p>The movie starts with a rainy night, and I was slightly upset that John Cusack didn't have a boombox over his head.  Ignoring that, Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a writer of books about haunted houses, inns, and amusement parks (I made that last part up for Scooby Doo fans).  Enslin gets a barrage of brochures, letters, and emails from people who want him to feature their own haunting.  Every single time Enslin goes in, the haunting is bogus, and the owners get their free publicity in the new Enslin book.  This all changes with one notification...<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson plays a dignified manager at an upscale, posh hotel in New York that just happens to have the most haunted room in history.  Room 1408 has had 56 deaths to date, and despite the room's reputation, the hotel is very expensive and busy.  Ignoring that perplexing contradiction, Samuel L. Jackson delivers as he always does, and keeps his career-long streak of dropping the F-bomb alive.<br /><br />What transpires is a reversal of Enslin's cynicism and doubt, as he realizes that all the previous debunking he has done at other rooms doesn't help him at all in 1408.  It's basically a hotel room taking on a life of its own - think Event Horizon on the 14th floor - and doing everything possible to scare Enslin senseless, and possibly lead to his death.</p></body></html>

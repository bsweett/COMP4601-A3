But I'm a big Robert Downey Jr. fan, and Downey's astounding performance in IRON MAN is the stellar exception to my disdain for this action hero genre.  Downey brings a rich authenticity and ebullient eccentricity to every role he plays, and this is certainly the case here; his portrayal of billionaire weapons designer Tony Stark is humorous, compelling, and--yes, even in an over the top super hero flick--believable.  Even rocketing through the skies in his IRON MAN suit Downey's Stark is funny, vulnerable, and pragmatic--in other words, all too human.  While demonstrating a new weapon in the Afghanistan wilderness before assembled Army VIPs he nonchalantly sips his drink while behind him chaos reigns supreme, and it's grand fun to watch.<br /><br />Is the story silly and farfetched?  Yes.  Is it occasionally sophomoric and extreme?  Yes.  Does it require a titanic suspension of disbelief?  Of course, but who cares?  Following a nasty stint as a hostage to some snarling jihadists (and escaping via an iron suit of his own making), Stark disavows the weapons of mass carnage his company has made, and focuses entirely on the technology to replicate the iron suit utilizing state-of-the-art technology.  This places him at odds with longtime business partner Obadiah Stane (played magnificently by Jeff Bridges), who, incidentally, is working on a suit of his own.  And of course this leads at breakneck speed to the ultimate battle of the Iron Men, who create carnage and mayhem in overload volume in downtown LA--all while Stark's personal assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow is stunning) looks on in terror and dismay.  The special effects are terrific, the action sequences heartpounding, and the pacing fast and furious; IRON MAN may be based on comic books, but this is one super hero film worth relishing again and again.<br />--D.

<meta name="summary" content="The Maltese Falcon"></head><body><p>After years of playing villains for Warner Brothers, this picture demonstrated once and for all Bogart's star quality. "The Maltese Falcon" is the definitive private eye film, where we see crooked human beings grabbing for their pot of gold in a bewildering urban jungle. An impressive debut feature for John Huston behind the camera, the film holds you in its grip throughout. Wait for that immortal ending!</p></body></html>

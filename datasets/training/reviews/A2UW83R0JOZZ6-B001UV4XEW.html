<meta name="summary" content="Funny, But Certainly Not Hilarious"></head><body><p>I'll admit it - I felt victim to hype when seeking out this movie.  I paid heed to all the positive reviews it got and trusted friends and family of mine that described it as "hilarious", one going so far as to say that he couldn't remember the last time he'd laughed that hard watching a movie.  Based on all this positive reception, I expected to be doubled over and trying to catch my breath while watching "The Hangover" but I found myself chuckling only moderately and feeling a little letdown once the end credits rolled.  The movie will tickle some funny bones more than others but on a personal laugh scale of 1 to 5, I only rate it a 3 and I have to assume it is because I am not a bachelorette, party girl or Vegas enthusiast, and I have no interest of ever visiting the place.<br /><br />The movie centers around a young affianced guy named Doug (Bartha) and his three groomsmen that take a trip to Vegas for one wild night a few days before his impending nuptials.  Phil (Cooper), a married teacher with a son, Stu (Helms), a dentist, Alan (Galifianakis), Doug's dim-witted brother-in-law-to-be and the groom himself all book an expensive villa at Caesar's Palace and toast one another on the roof of the building before descending the stairs again for partying and debauchery.  When they wake up the next morning, the posh villa has been demolished - an armchair smolders in the main sitting area, food and drink are all over the place, a clucking chicken roams the halls and a tiger (yes, you read that right - a TIGER) has taken residence in the bathroom.  Waking up on the floor severely dazed and assessing the celebratory carnage around them, they notice Doug is missing from their small band and they immediately embark on a search for him, desperate to make it to LA for the wedding before it's too late.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is a puckish step-by-step of how all the mayhem transpired.  Along with the mysteries of the animals roaming the villa are Stu's missing tooth, Phil's hospital bracelet, a mattress on the roof of Caesar's Palace and a stolen cop car, not to mention everyone's curious amnesia.  When a date rape drug called rohypnol (aka "roofies") is found to be the culprit for their short-term memory loss, they exhaust every little lead they can to locate Doug, becoming impromptu detectives in the process, and wind up in much bigger predicaments than they all thought possible.  The film depends on these outlandish quandaries for its laughs and pulls out all the stops for a zany Vegas adventure, some of which include a quickie marriage to a stripper, a run-in with "Iron Mike" Tyson and a hostage situation in the desert.  The script (derived from a real life Vegas bender) relies on moderate amounts of profanity, sexual humor, nudity (I personally could've done without seeing Galifianakis's hairy, cellulite-ridden posterior), drugs/alcohol and the general lore of Sin City for its laughs.  It certainly doesn't help that it comes from screenwriters who are fairly young in their careers.  The end result is that it doesn't break any new ground in the comedy genre, despite its critical and box office success (it's grossed more than $277 million in the US and Canada as of December 2009).<br /><br />Helms (of "The Office" fame as Andy Bernard) plays the sensible guy of the bunch who acquiesces to his cold, stiff harpy of a girlfriend because he's too nice for his own good (you can hardly wait for her to get a comeuppance of some sort).  Cooper is the guy with a devil-may-care streak who is dissatisfied with the mediocrity of his life and Galifianakis is a big-hearted oddball who is just trying to belong.  Bartha doesn't get to stretch his legs much as Doug because of his absence from over half the film, his character just a conduit for the plot.  Heather Graham as a smokin' hot but kindly stripper named Jade comes off as a real sweetheart just looking for a connection with an honest man.<br /><br />Bottom line: Despite becoming the eighth-highest grossing film of 2009 so far and snagging a Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, I'm overall not impressed with "The Hangover" and am glad I did not buy it before watching it.  Though I wouldn't have regretted it deeply, it still would've stung to spend $15 on a film that failed to conjure the side-splitting laughs I was so readily expecting.</p></body></html>

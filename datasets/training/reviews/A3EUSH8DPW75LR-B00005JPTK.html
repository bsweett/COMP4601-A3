<meta name="summary" content="Amazing Film"></head><body><p>I absolutely loved this film.  I must admit i did not expect much going into it.  I have never been a huge Will Smith fan or a fan of science fiction which this film seemed to be.  Wow, was I shocked and amazed with the excellent, quality film of the highest caliber that totally took me by surprise.<br /><br />This film is so well made.  I thought the story was very well laid out.  The government thought that they had finally found a cure for cancer by using a vaccine for another illness.  After much use the treatment backfired with major side effects with the people turning into flesh eating zombies who could never be in the sun.  I didn't look at the creatures as mere vampire like beings but thought the deterioration due to the vaccine was well documented.  Back to the plot, New York City becomes quaurantined and Will Smith plays Neville, a military scientist who stays in New York to work on finding a cure.<br /><br />The barren and stranded New York City is amazing to view.  I was caught up in the film from the first second and amazed as I watched the small world Neville had created for himself and his dog which allowed him to work on the cure but also have protection from the creatures.  He ventured out every day and returned at night.  Will Smith has been praised for other films but his work here was truly Oscar worthy.  The first half of the film is the best when it is just him and the dog.  His characterization is more than believable as the lone survivor who deals with loneliness by talking to mannequins etc.  He has not gone crazy but has adapted.  I found the story to also be believable and the creatures when shown were also believable and very well created.  The movie has a serious basis but also has chills and thrills like one of the best horror films there are.<br /><br />In the latter half of the film the plot changes a little (I won't give it away) and the 5 star plus caliber of the first half gets a little off track.  It is still excellent but the first half was so superior it is hard to compete with.  The film has a purpose and shows Will Smith as never seen before.  Whatever your expectations for this film, upon viewing they will be far surpassed.  Excellent acting, amazing production and directing.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

AND WHEN HIS BROTHER LARRY [ANDREW ROBINSON] AND HIS BROTHER'S WIFE AND FRANK'S FORMER LOVER JULIA [CLAIRE HIGGINS] MOVE INTO HIS OLD HOUSE, HE SOON COMES BACK TO LIFE AS A SKINLESS MONSTER. THIS AIN'T YOUR AVERAGE HORROR FILM! THIS FILM HAS A FEW SHOCKINGLY VIOLENT AND THRILLING MURDER SEQUENCES. VERY WELL DONE AND VERY IMAGINATIVE. THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE WHOLE FILM IS THE CENOBITES, WHICH IS LED BY THE INFAMOUS PINHEAD [PLAYED BY DOUG BRADLEY]. HOLD ON TO YOUR SEATS! BASED ON THE CLIVE BARKER NOVEL ''THE HELLBOUND HEART''. FOLLOWED BY FIVE SEQUELS.</p></body></html>

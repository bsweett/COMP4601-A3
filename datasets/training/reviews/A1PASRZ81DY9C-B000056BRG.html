Highly budgeted picture amassing thousands (over 15,000!) of extras, so glorious Rome is depicted. Ben-Hur deserves lots of praise. The great climax comes at the chariot race. Stephen Boyd garners a great respect from me for his role as Messala. I am dismayed to learn afterwards that Stephen Boyd wasn't acknowledged for his finest supporting work. What a surprise (!!!) that Hugh Griffith (who played the Sheik) instead got the overrated praise. That is a huge mistake there. The terrific villainous line from Messala is, "There's still enough of a man here for you to hate!" The dazzling speed in that chariot race awes me. Although the race is the highlight of Ben-Hur, the movie is much more than that. It is interesting to note how the rise of Jesus Christ overshadowed the apparent elements portrayed in the movie and diminished the memory of sufferings each character had undergone. That is what makes Ben-Hur so great. When I think of it, an intriguing comparison is evoked when reflecting back on Gone with the Wind. Ben-Hur never overstays its presence, only to shine in its length of the greatest of that era that was once the high and the mighty power of the Roman Empire. The setup and the landscape of Rome are mind-blowing in its rich colors. Overall, Ben-Hur is a must-see spectacle. It is a lost art of epic films, indeed!<br /><br />4/06: An absolutely magnificent picture. Fantastic! Thrilling! Mind blowing! Spectacular! A true epic in every sense of the word, Ben-Hur is so breathtaking that its trivia is even more breathtaking than the film per se. Moreover, Ben-Hur will never be equalized again in its sheer grandness and brilliance. Forget the stupid, contrived computer graphics made films that aim to cheat its way around. Watch Ben-Hur and notice the difference of how and the way movies are supposed to be made. Outstanding all-around performances are throughout the picture. If Judah Ben-Hur is the biggest figure of Ben-Hur, Jesus Christ of Nazareth is way even bigger. The shadow he throws on Ben-Hur is so omnipotent that Ben-Hur becomes a secondary legend. What makes Ben-Hur great is the test of values, loyalty, honor, and principles. One of the greatest screen scenes is the famous, awe-inspiring Chariot Race in the most spectacular fashion of Rome's Circus. Nothing defies the thrill of the screen like Ben-Hur does.<br /><br />7/11: Still an incredible picture to this day. It has no equal.</p></body></html>

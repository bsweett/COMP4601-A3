<meta name="summary" content="this has the classic 1951 version too."></head><body><p>The new version of this movie is at best a three star sci fi flick with todays emphasis on more action but it has decent acting and is not a one star movie. It's a not a classic movie like the original movie which is also here on blu ray!.<br />So this is a five star package because you get both movies. Studios need to go back and put more older movies on blu ray in double packs etc. This is a good idea. The blu ray of the original movie does not have the extras that the seperate version<br />of 'day the earth stood still' blu ray does though.  I have that edition, the film is the same but the many extras are not there. Interviews and other features which should have been on this edition. This is wierd but still I sold that one off because now I had two editions of it on blu ray. Get this set , u get a classic movie from 1951 and a decent remake, that's a great deal.</p></body></html>

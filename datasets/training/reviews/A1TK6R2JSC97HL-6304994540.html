An unemployed, pot-smoking loser, he's the laziest person in LA - which qualifies him as one of the laziest men on Earth.  Released in the late `90's, but occurring around "Desert Storm", "The Big Lebowski" tells of The Dude's misadventures after being sucked into what appears to be a kidnapping involving his wife.  (During pot-smoking binges, little bits of The Dude's existence boil out - incl. his credit in some past Hollywood movies which doubtlessly provide for his meager and undemanding existence.)  Only, The Dude's never been married - the kidnap really involves the wife of another Jeff Lebowski, a millionaire who is everything the Dude is not.  While The Big Lebowski (David Huddleston) rules from a palatial estate, The Dude's existence boils down to weed, "White Russians" and bowling with Donnie (understated Steve Buscemi) and Walter (Coen Bros. fave John Goodman).  When his rich doppelganger's complications spill over on The Dude (literally, on one of the Dude's favorite rugs), The Dude decides to take the fight over to the big man himself - necessarily getting himself sucked into Big Lebowski's machinations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the best laid plans of mice, men and two Lebowskis are steamrolled by Walter - a one-man weapon of mass destruction.  Early on we see how far Walter will go to protect his ideals on bowling, and he soon buts his way into the schemes of the two Lebowskis to the frustration of everybody.  The Coen brothers's script tosses in a squad of nihilists (including indie rocker Aimee Mann), a master pornographer (Ben Gazzara), theft of the Dude's car, various hallucinations involving bowling, Big Lebowski's affected performance-artist of a Daughter (Julianne Moore) and a mysterious stranger played by Sam Elliot.<br /><br />It's easy to dismiss this flick as a Coen Bros. version of "The Big Sleep" - the parallels are there in terms of plot and spirit.  (I prefer to view it an unofficial Coen Bros. sequel to "Tron", in which the ordered existence of cyberspace of the first movie has been eroded as mankind has begun to stumble into it via the worldwide web.  When you compare the people involved in programming in '82 to those involved in cyberspace by Netscape's IPO, it's not a difficult image.)  While others have easily written this off as a comedy of mistaken identity, it's more accurate to praise this flick as a shining example of the mistake-of-identity - nobody is what they seem by the end of the flick: despite his pot smoking, The Dude will experience moments of lucidity; Walter will adhere to Orthodox Judaism even though he's Polish Catholic, and by the end of the flick will give a eulogy for a character that has nothing to do with that character; Donnie will wear numerous personalized shirts - none of which actually bear his name; a flamboyant bowler named "Jesus" will be revealed to be a sex-offender; neither Lebowski nor his "wife" are what they seem; the nihilists aren't all that nihilistic.<br /><br />At the heart of the movie is a conflict between the Chandler-style plot (which begins to unravel) and the movie's will to be another fun, if preposterous Coen Brothers movie in the vein of "Oh Brother" and "Raising Arizona".  At some point, the Coens win out over Chandler, but that leaves the winners with a hollow shell of a movie - which retroactively becomes as rootless and inconsequential as The Dude himself.  In short, it's a fun flick that you shouldn't be ready to look into as deeply as I have.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very Nice Enjoyable Movie"></head><body><p>It is very sad that Adrienne Shelley will never get to direct another film.  This is a very nice small film that shows promise for a novice director.  A young woman with a lousy husband becomes pregnant and is very unhappy about it.  Throw in an improbable relationship with her gynacologist and there is the movie.  The performances are sweet, the characters are engaging and movie is fun to watch.  Something simple can be very satisfying at times.</p></body></html>

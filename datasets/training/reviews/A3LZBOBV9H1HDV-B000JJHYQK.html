This is a great, political, action ride. Clark Johnson's (who also directed "S.W.A.T." (2003) & who also appears in a small, but crucial role to the film) directing is excellent. George Nolfi's (who also wrote the screenplay to "Timeline" (2003) & the story & screenplay to "Ocean's Twelve" (2004), screenplay, based on the novel by Gerald Petievich (who was a Secret Service agent), is excellent. The music by Christophe Beck (who also did the score to "The Pink Panther" (2006) is excellent. The cinematography by Gabriel Beristain (who also did the cinematography to "The Shaggy Dog" (2006) & also did the cinematography to Johnson's "S.W.A.T" (2003) is excellent. The film editing by Cindy Mollo is great. The casting by Robin D. Cook (who also did the casting to "16 Blocks" (2006) & "Lucky Number Slevin" (2006) & Avy Kaufman (who also does the casting to the upcoming "All The King's Men" (2006) is great. The production design by Andrew McAlpine is excellent. The art direction by Halina Gebarowicz & Rocco Matteo is excellent. The set decoration by Carolyn 'Cal' Loucks is excellent. The costume design by Ellen Mirojnick (who also did the costume design to "Failure To Launch" (2006) & the upcoming "Deja Vu" (2006) is excellent.</p></body></html>

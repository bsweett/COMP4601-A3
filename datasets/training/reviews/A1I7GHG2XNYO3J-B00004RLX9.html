<meta name="summary" content="Khan Lives!!"></head><body><p>This is the best of the Star Trek movies bar none. Its the only one i will review as i would give them all a 5* rating and in truth this one is most likely the only one deserving of such (except maybe for III and IV). Khan is alive and on the loose. His heart is full of hate for Kirk and he will stop at nothing to destroy him and perhaps the universe as we know it. If you buy only one of the original crew Star Trek movies this is the one. Of course after this one Star Trek III The Search for Spock will be a must have as well.</p></body></html>

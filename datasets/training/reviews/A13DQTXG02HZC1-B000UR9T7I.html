This franchise was excellent under the guidance of Sam Raimi & I had my reservation if it's going to have an uneventful death as XMen3.  Fortunately, Spiderman 3 is still good when it could have been an outstanding classic. One outstanding trait from Sam is that he seldoms portrays the villains as two dimensional but that they are portrayed as victims of their circumstances.  This is intact for the third offering.  However, a better editing or a tighter script could have ironed out a few lull spots particularly Parker's relationship with Mary Jane which tended to drag on. In the cinema, I could see a large number of audience shifting uncomfortably looking for some actions.  The editor of the Daily Bugle is naturally the comic relief for this offering & so was Bruce Campbell from the Evil Dead.  I'm glad that the twists in this movie isn't revealed or else it would spoil the fun of others who haven't watched this movie.  Having said that, for comic book fans, you probably know already.  I do pick up nice messages from this movie, that ultimately, all of us have a choice in life.  At times, we might have lost our way but then, we need to persevere & we need to have self belief to bring the best out within ourselves.  This is arguably one of the most expensive movie ever made and it shows.  The final climatic battle is worth every penny.  Commendable watching.</p></body></html>

How exactly they know how to do all this is incredible.<br /><br />First they all leap out of the ocean and begin to march, single file, for over 70 miles, to their preferred breeding ground. They look really cute as they do this.<br /><br />Then, when they are at their breeding ground, they look for a partner. There are loads more boys than girls, so the competition is stiff. But, eventually, they find a partner and the magic happens. Do penguins fall in love? It seems they do and they all have strange rituals of hugging and talking gibberish. I have no doubts that they are actually talking to each other.<br /><br />As winter comes, they all huddle together in a group. Eggs are laid and passed onto the male as the female go off to search for food. Some eggs are misplaced and the unhatched baby penguin dies. It's really sad.<br /><br />As the girls are away, the boys have to suffer intense blizzards and snow storms. Some of the older ones die, or as Morgan Freeman says, simply go to sleep. A close-up of a penguin closing his eyes for the final time is truly a deeply affecting moment. Since this is the part where it's the males fighting for themselves, this is probably the reason there are less of them.<br /><br />When the girls return, the eggs hatch and adorable little babies poke their heads out and see the world for the first time. But since they are so small, they need to stay sheltered. The males are still sheltering and when the female wants it back they have to move very quickly since the fragile little penguin cannot be out of warmth for more than a few moments.<br /><br />Some die. And a scene where a mother pokes at her dead chick is utterly heartbreaking. However, the majority survives. As they have done for thousands of years. And as summer arrives they grown-ups depart, leaving the babies on their own. And when one of the plucks up enough courage to dive in the ocean, the rest follow. And soon, they'll be back to take part in the same ritual, the same survival quest.<br /><br />It's a purity and innocence that humans have long, long, LONG lost. Every creature on earth exists simply to multiply and be the dominant species. But surely Emperor Penguins do it in the toughest of conditions. Nature may be cruel, but it's pure. You might even end up a little jealous and insist on living as a hermit or wildman in a vain attempt at getting back to nature. But, inevitable, you'll probably miss your playstation and porn too much.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman's narration is brilliant. But since he has the second coolest voice in the world (after Lance Henrikson) I could probably listen to him for hours even if he was just reading the dictionary. The score by Alex Wurman is also great and when coupled with the beautiful cinematography it makes for huge escapism. It reminds me a lot of the Landscape Channel, which I used to watch as a kid.<br /><br />I totally recommend the film. And it's cool that for once a family film can be a documentary and NOT some total crap with Eddie Murphy or Steve Martin selling themselves out.</p></body></html>

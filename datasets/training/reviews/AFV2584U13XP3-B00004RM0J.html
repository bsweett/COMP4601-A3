<meta name="summary" content="Great 80's Nostalgic Movie"></head><body><p>I still remember watching this in the theatres when it came out and getting this DVD brings those memories back alive.The story is about a group of middle class families and their kids who live near the boon docks of the city<br />but now the families homes face foreclosure.The kids who don't want to leave find a map hidden in one of the kids home attic to a pirates treasure hidden somewhere near the town and deciding to have at least on adventure or as they call it a last Goonie adventure to try and find the treasure.Along the way they will have a run in with an escaped family of criminals who have hidden out in the towns abandoned shack near the ocean and unfortunately the entrance to the pirates cave the Goonies need to get into.This is one of the great 80's movie I loved,grew up with,and still remember lovingly to this day for those who grew up in the 80's definitely<br />buy this and for those who are looking for a great family,funny,action adventure movie highly recommended...</p></body></html>

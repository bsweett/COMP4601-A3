Night Shyamalan...if you're looking for ..."once upon a time there was a girl/boy they grew up got married and had kids".....forget about it. This man's work ventures on mystery with a twist...mythology with a hint of weird. In short you have to develop a taste for his talent and after you do....you'll enjoy it.</p></body></html>

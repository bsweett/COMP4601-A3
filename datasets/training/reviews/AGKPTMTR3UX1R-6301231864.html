Although director George Romero has spent his career trying to replicate this film he has never succeeded and realistically never will.<br /><br />Shot in grainy, low definition black and white with a muddy soundtrack, peopled with actors nobody ever heard of before or since, and done on a budget of about $82.47, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD has all the production quality of an 8mm home movie, which is what makes it so effective.<br /><br />The storyline is simple: A mixed group of terrified people are trapped in a remote farmhouse trying to escape from a horde of dead ghouls, who have been reanimated by a radiation burst from an exploding space probe. The ghouls are "deadicated" (pardon the pun) to killing and eating the living, who then become ghouls themselves.<br /><br />The acting quality is unprofessional and brilliantly sincere. The tensions within the group are at a fever pitch. Barbara is a terrified girl, almost zombielike herself from shock after being attacked by a ghoul at the outset of the story. Ben is a competent, driven man fully committed to staying alive. He happens to be a black man, which although never specifically mentioned, underlies the animosity between himself and Harry Cooper, a disagreeable middle-aged coward who bullies his wife, Helen and daughter Karen, and tries to control everyone else in the house. The group is rounded out by Tom and Judy, a local young couple. Without meaning to, Romero created a 1968 period piece on social and race relations. Life and living is reduced to the most primal of conditions in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.<br /><br />The ghouls are frightening in their silence and inexorable craving for flesh. The scenes of them feeding are utterly grotesque, and have revolted reviewers and audiences alike since this film was first released.<br /><br />So much of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD has become part of subsequent moviemaking dynamics that it is hard to imagine the impact this movie originally had.<br /><br />Best viewed on Halloween or on a stormy night, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD never fails to terrify and entertain. Viewers are best advised to stay away from the remastered full-frills editions as unnecessary; for sheer impact, nothing is better than the bargain dollar DVD release or the spotty budget VCR version.</p></body></html>

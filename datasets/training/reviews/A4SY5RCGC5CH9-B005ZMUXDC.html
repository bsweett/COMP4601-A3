<meta name="summary" content="A movie with a legally blond princess, a likeable scoundrel, lots of tongue in the ear humor and serious horse power!"></head><body><p>Finally! Disney is back with a vengeance... eh, I mean, a princess! This is the great come back of Walt Disney Animation Studios to the classical fairy tales, which made the happiness of so many children since "White Snow" sang that first song... My daughter absolutely loved "Tangled" and I liked it at least as much, for all the reasons mentioned in the title:<br /><br />1. Princess Rapunzel - together with "The Princess and the Frog" in 2009, this is the return of Disney Princesses after a long leave of absence, and Rapunzel is certainly a great success. Her magic hair gives of course a great show but Rapunzel herself is the real star. Having spend all her life in a tower she is quite naive and can even seem simple, but her charm and courage are simply irresistible. The scene in which she handles alone a whole tavern full of mercenaries, rogues, brigands and other scum of the earth is a great moment of cinema!<br /><br />2. Flynn Rider, the thief - he is an extremely likable scoundrel, a perfect mix of Errol Flynn's Robin Hood and Douglas Fairbanks Jr Thief of Baghdad, with just a little something of Han Solo and Captain Jack Sparrow (just younger than both of them). It can seem an unlikely choice to make a thief in the hero of a child story, but Flynn Rider is hardly a real criminal, more like a wannabee - and for all his past misdeeds he is going to be seriously punished in this movie and will have ample occasion to redeem himself... He is also certainly a irresistibly charming character.<br /><br />3. Humor - well, other than Rapunzel's pet chameleon who loves stick his tongue in people's ears, humor is provided by shovels in almost every scene and by almost every character in the movie - but mostly by the brilliant dialogs between Rapunzel and Flynn. Grown ups will find this movie almost certainly as entertaining as children. And mind this frying pan!<br /><br />4. Horse power - I kept the best for the end. Maximus the horse is absolutely the greatest character in the whole movie! As promised on the poster this is a noble steed who can do everything, including sword fighting! In fact the more we progress through the movie, the more we realize that Maximus is in fact.. but no! I am not telling you anything more about him! If you missed this movie in the cinema, you deserve to discover everything about Maximus the horse by yourself!<br /><br />To conclude, this movie is a wonder! Great job Walt Disney Animation Studios and let's hope that their next movies will keep the same quality level!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="more bitter than sweet"></head><body><p>yet another collaboration twixt tim burton and johnny depp produces what will forever be deemed a remake of the gene wilder "willie wonka" of a generation earlier.  this time around the movie is darker, and i will leave it for the individual viewer to decide which take you prefer.  me?  i tend to think both movies are a bit overdone, tho i find both entertaining on their own levels.  and the added attraction here is the presence of freddie highmore, a talented and pulchritudinous young actor who makes anything worth seeing.</p></body></html>

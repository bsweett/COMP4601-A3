<meta name="summary" content="A Talented Cast Brings To Life This Powerful Drama"></head><body><p>Doubt, based on the Tony award winning play, is perhaps the most well acted film of the year, with four of its stars being nominated for Oscar's and a screenplay that blurs the line between who is right and who is wrong.<br /><br />Sister Aloysius is the strict, hard nosed principle of the local Catholic school who finds herself in the midst of a personal battle between one of the priest, Father Flynn, who may or may not be abusing one of the altar boys. With the help of a fellow nun, the two of them investigate to uncover the truth and bring justice to light.<br /><br />As mentioned before, this film is superbly acted. Meryl Streep, already a legend, earned her fifteenth nomination for her role, who balances wit, steely demure, and when she let loose in some of the confrontations, its a very powerful thing to watch. Phillip Seymore Hoffman imbues Father Flynn with so much warm and kindness it most certainlty instills doubt in the viewer if he truly is capable of such a horrible act. Amy Adams acts as the mediator between the two, always holding her own against the two experience actors. And finally Viola Davis, who joins the select few actors to make the most out of a limited role.<br /><br />The film is very shady about the details about the crime and never gives any explicit details. This causes you to wonder, did Father Flynn do it? Is Sister Aloysius wrong? As the film goes on, you get little snip its of details that one moment will say the two nuns are right and then the next putting that questioning feeling in you and by the end of the film (spoiler alert! do not read on if you have not seen the film!) you are left to wonder, did Father Flynn really do it? or was it all just an overblown lie?<br /><br />This is a must see film for anyone who has followed the award season.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Fantastic First Season (Too Good to Be True)"></head><body><p>The first season of Lost was fascinating television ... or at least it seemed like that.<br />From the get-go this series was unlike anything I'd seen on television, a brilliant mix of powerful human drama and mysterious science-fiction adventure and suspense. It was so exciting. TV was exciting again.<br /><br />I have to add in retrospect that the second season was disappointing because it seemed the writers were unsure of which direction to go, and they just kept adding mystery after mystery, leaving us with endless questions. I stopped watching after Season 2 because the series could not live up to its first season's promises (and the seasons were getting alarmingly shorter anyway).<br /><br />As for season one, well, for a bunch of Wednesday evenings in 2004, I was absolutely enthralled. I actually looked forward to a television program; a drama, no less. But in the back of my mind there was a seed of doubt. So the promise that "Lost" held to intrigue me slipped away into smoke, vanishing into thin air. I didn't even tune in to Season 3. I'd had enough disappointment and endless unanswered questions.<br /><br />But the potential and possibility presented in the first season was unforgettable.</p></body></html>

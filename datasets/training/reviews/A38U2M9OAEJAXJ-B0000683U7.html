<meta name="summary" content="Next to "Psycho," This Is My Favorite Hitchcock Movie"></head><body><p>"North by Northwest" is Alfred Hitchcock's followup to 1958's moody "Vertigo."  While it's not as "deep" as the latter film, "N by NW" is a first-rate action/mystery film that stands as one of the greatest films of all time.  The ever-suave Cary Grant and the striking Eva Marie Saint star in a movie that has all the elements we've come to expect from Hitch: mistaken identity, the intriguing blonde, murder, and deception.  And let's not forget the script, which is pregnant with witty one-liners and dodges cliches at all costs.  I wasn't around in 1959, but watching a movie like this in the theatre had to have been such an incredible experience.  You are literally hooked from the first frame.  The DVD itself is an attractive affair.  The picture is the best-looking I've ever seen in a Hitchcock movie.  In another review, I stated that "Vertigo" is the only film by Hitch available in 5.1 surround sound.  I was wrong!  "N by NW" is also in 5.1, and while the sound won't necessarily rock your system, it's a pretty decent soundtrack for a movie this old.  So, what are you waiting for?  I saw this on a friend's recommendation, and I'm kicking myself for not discovering it sooner.  "North by Northwest" is action filmmaking at its absolute peak and should not be missed.  I repeat: it's one of the greatest films of all time.</p></body></html>

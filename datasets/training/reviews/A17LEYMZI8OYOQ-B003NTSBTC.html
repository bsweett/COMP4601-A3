At 90-105 minutes, it could have been a classic of the genre, but like so many of Scorsese's movies (e.g. GANGS OF NEW YORK, THE AVIATOR), he lets it go on far too long.  137 minutes to be exact.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand.  I think that Scorsese is one of our finest living filmmakers, and SHUTTER ISLAND is an extremely well-made picture.  However, what Marty doesn't seem to get is that "less is more".<br /><br />Without going into plot specifics, the first act of the picture works very well.  Scorsese creates a wonderful spooky, haunted house-like atmosphere that totally draws you into the story.<br /><br />But, the second act is a total mess.  It wanders all over the place and, rather than my jumping in my seat when the director probably hoped that I would do so, I found myself wondering when the movie was going to get to its overdue climax.  In other words, I was bored.<br /><br />However, there is a twist that leads into the third act that totally took me by surprise and from that point on, I was back with the movie.<br /><br />I just wish that Scorsese and company could have gotten to that point sooner.<br /><br />This is definitely no criticism of the actors, but I would have cut the roles played by Ted Levine and Elias Koteas.  They were totally unnecessary and their scenes did not move the story forward.  I would have also cut some of Michelle Williams' scenes for the same reason.<br /><br />? Michael B.

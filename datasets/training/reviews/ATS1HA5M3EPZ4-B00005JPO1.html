The beauty of the premise was it revolved around a very complex man who lived two lives; that of a Professor and that of a globe trotting archeologist.  Even though the second movie (Temple of Doom) was the most disappointing, it was still better then this over the top attempt to make more money on a popular franchise.<br /><br />Once again, Spielberg & Lucas do it THEIR way.  It doesn't matter if they break the barriers of realism.  C'MON GUYS, I used to love your work.  And sadly, they know exactly what they're doing.  War of the Worlds wasn't like this!<br /><br />So what happened to the first movie we all know and loved?  Raiders of the Lost Ark came on to the scene as a breakthrough genre, making the Saturday morning serials that I'm too young to remember come to life...and Ford played it perfectly.  He was born for the role.  Indiana Jones ventured his way across the global, finding artifacts and history.  Sometimes having to fight his way through a world where civilization had not found it's foothold.  There were great stunts, great villains and most all...the fun that comes with going on that journey.  The supernatural element of Raiders was kept to a minimum.  We were teased throughout about the `Power of God' and the influence of the Ark.  So when something out of this world happened, we believed it.  It was scary.  And most of all, it worked at the most minimal state.<br /><br />Now...Indy is surviving an atomic explosion in a refrigerator!?  I don't care how much lead that thing was lined with, he would have been smear on the inside when it finally stopped!  And falling over not just one 80 foot waterfall in an amphibious car...BUT THREE?!  That car would have been splintered on the first fall!  This puts Indiana Jones in a Superhero, indestructible category and de-humanizes him.  And he barely got hurt.  By the third act of Raiders, he was almost incapacitated.  But we were routing for him to keep going.  By the third act of this one it was apparent that nothing could kill him, so I didn't care anymore.<br /><br />None of this might have bothered me too much if the movie had been really entertaining...but it wasn't.  Quite frankly it bored me at times.  I was glad to see Karen Allen return and some of the nostalgia was nice to see.  I like Shai LeBouf but he is Spielberg's golden boy of the moment and he's putting him in every movie he can.  He just seemed like an add-in here.  I've always admired Ford though.  He still persists as a great action hero despite his age.  He looked a little more haggard when doing his stunts and his punches didn't have the finesse they used too, but he looked great for his age.  He altered Indy's demeanor for this role to reflect his senior status and how things had changed.  Unfortunately the script could really carry the weight of the situation.<br /><br />I felt like after watching this movie Spielberg and Lucas were saying, `Ha!  You wanted it so bad we knew we could make it over the top and still get your money.'  For Spielberg, a man who uses so many digital composite shots and green screens, yet claims he loves movies for the grandeur of making movies, it's hard to believe he won't shoot a film on digital like his friend George.  Seems like quite a hypocrisy.  I should have known.</p></body></html>

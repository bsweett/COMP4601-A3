<meta name="summary" content="North by Northwest,suspense at its best!"></head><body><p>Right next to The Birds, I would rate this as one of Alfred Hitchcock's best thrillers! Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are superb in their talented roles of the wrong man at the wrong time. From New York, to Chicago, to Indiana to Mt. Rushmore,it is over two hours of great suspense and scenery. By the way if you live and encounter a crop dusting plane be careful! You will be on the edge of your seat with this classic!</p></body></html>

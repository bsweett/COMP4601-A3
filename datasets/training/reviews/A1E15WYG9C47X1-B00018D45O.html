<meta name="summary" content="Don't Compare!"></head><body><p>I am a huge fan of the 1974-Tobe Hooper's film Texas Chainsaw Massacre and consider it one of the most intelligent horror films ever made.So I did have few misgivings about watching this new remake (and not another sequel), being very much disappointed before with similar ventures(one example that comes to my mind  is Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes),but watch it I did and I have to admit that I did enjoy it very much.<br />You have to give credit where credit is due, and to be fair Marcus Nispel, in his first feature film, did a competent job in creating a dark and sinister atmosphere from the very start,and injecting an equal and effective dosage of tension/suspense and gore. All the actors were very good, especially the excellent R.Lee Ermey as the demented sheriff/head of the psycho family,(yes the one and only R.Lee Ermey from Full Metal Jacket fame, but it seems unfair that he is mostly remembered for Kubrick's masterpiece as he has done a large collection of work since).<br />Other actors who impressed me were Six Feet Under's Eric Balfour, and of course Jessica Biel!(she is a Goddess,it is official!!..but seriously she did a very convincing and sexy performance).<br />Now I have to point out a very important matter:<br />You will enjoy this film much more if you do not compare it too much with the original, as some reviewers did, but watch it instead as a 'new' film.<br />Indeed,the two Texas Chainsaw Massacre films are based on the same horrible events that actually happened in Texas's backyard, so in a way it is not a copy or a remake in the proper sense of the word.<br />Besides ,if comparisons are to be made, more recent films are more apt,and one can be made with Wrong Turn which was mediocre at best and not as well directed.<br />Although choosing the same title was a bold move and will inevitably draw much criticism (hence the very low marks from some reviewers) because no matter how good Nispel's version is, no one can possibly recreate the sheer raw and unrelenting power and brutality of the first.But I don't think the filmmaker intended to do that..with a screenplay based on the 1974 one by Kim Henkel and Tobe Hooper, I do believe that they acknowledged the classic status of the original,and I think, it is an indirect tribute to it, not a pretentious and haughty attempt to undermine it.<br />So Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a good film, that delivers good 'ole fashioned edge of your seat-popcorn flying' tension, one that you will enjoy much more if you forget the original for a while,and acknowledge a competent direction and acting.</p></body></html>

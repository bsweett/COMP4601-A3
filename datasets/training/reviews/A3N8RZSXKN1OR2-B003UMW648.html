<meta name="summary" content="Even bettere than the book"></head><body><p>The second installment in the Narnia franchise (the filmmakers are apparently following the chronological publication order of the books rather than their order in Narnian history) maintains the high quality of the first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition)</a> and actually improves upon the book it was based on.  It's been a year since we last saw the four Pevensie children, the Battle of Britain is over, and London is safe enough for them to go back there--or at least to pass through on their way to boarding school.  But Peter (William Moseley), in particular, finds it difficult to forget that he was a High King in Narnia for 15 years or so.  Then unknown magic draws them back to the land they once ruled--only to find that centuries have passed there, their castle of Caer Paravel is a forgotten ruin, and Narnia has been conquered by the neighboring Telmarines, who have succeeded in driving the Old Narnains--dwarves, fauns, talking animals, centaurs, and the rest--into hiding.  The sole hope they have for freedom is the young prince, Caspian (Ben Barnes), whose uncle and guardian, Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), has recently ordered him killed upon fathering a son of his own and seizing the throne.  Caspian, it turns out, has summoned the Pevensies back by means of Susan's (Anna Popplewell) ivory horn--and is a bit disappointed to find out that they're only children.  But Narnia's magic is working on them already, and they may be a greater help to him than anyone knows.<br /><br />Once again, if you've read the book, you know what to expect in the way of plot.  The story might have benefited from giving us all the background on Caspian and his tutor, Dr. Cornelius (Vincent Grass), who was largely responsible for teaching him the true history of Narnia and inspiring him to want to rule it properly.  But it's definitely improved by a non-canonical attempt on the part of the Old Narnian army to seize Miraz's castle in the dark of night and make him a prisoner (watch for the gryphons being used, as they were in the first film, as a Narnian airborne auxiliary--almost certainly something Peter or Edmund (Skandar Keynes) thought of), and by a hint of attraction between Caspian and Susan.  Castellitto is a wonderful villain with a touch of the exotic, and, of course, the effects are dazzling, especially the battle scenes and the Old Narnians (Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard), the swashbuckling Talking Mouse, is an utter delight, and be sure to keep your eye open for the very young, and very proud, centaur colt who's part of the triumphal arch of swords with which they salute the four returned Kings and Queens).  Liam Neeson returns as the excellent voice of Aslan.  Though perhaps more savage and violent than the book, it's also much more exciting and faster-paced.  The third entry, "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader," is scheduled to be released around Christmastime and should be just as good.</p></body></html>

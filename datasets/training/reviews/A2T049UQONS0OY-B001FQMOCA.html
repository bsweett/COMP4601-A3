<meta name="summary" content="Best biopic since "Kinsey""></head><body><p>This is the best big budget, big screen biopic I've seen since "Kinsey", another film that tried to define its lead character through the poor relationship he had with his father.<br /><br />In "Walk the Line", Joaquin Phoenix plays rock-country superstar Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon plays wife June Carter Cash. What most distinguishes this biopic is the wonderful singing of the two leads, who do their own voicing for their parts. Phoenix is remarkable as Cash and Witherspoon somewhat less so as Carter Cash.<br /><br />The movies takes us from Cash's early boyhood, where his father chides God for taking the wrong son when John's brother dies, through his drug addicted adulthood and failed first marriage, up to the point where he and Carter tied the knot in 1968. They lived together 35 years and died within a few months of each other in 2003.<br /><br />The movie also includes characterizations of Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley, both of whom apparently came of age in the Memphis music scene with Cash and Carter. The film effectively portrays the rigors of the music business in the 1950s with its night after night stops, groupies, bus travel, drinking, drugs and partying, and the way this wears down people and relationships (both Cash and Carter had failed marriages related to their music lifestyles.)<br /><br />For me, the best part of this picture is the singing. It is universally effective in a toe tapping mood. The movie would have been about half as good without the music. In this regard, Witherspoon was much better here than in "Vanity Fair", where her singing of 1800 music was consistently behind the beat and off-key. Phoenix was a near double for Cash, a fellow that was easy to mimic.</p></body></html>

Also, so you know,this is not Dracula in the most traditional sense. If this is what you are looking for, then you are better off looking in the direction of Lugosi or Langella. All of that said, this is an excellent movie well worth watching. It pays tribute to the many horrors of the past. (Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolfman) It even starts by showing the first scene in black and white. (A nice tribute to the black and white era of horror movies.) While paying tribute to this time in the history of horror, the movie takes a closer look at the hero (Van Helsing). While Peter Cushing (Christopher Lee's enemy)  and Laurence Olivier (Frank Langella's enemy) handled the role of Van Helsing with style and charm, this movie explores the inner struggles of Van Helsing. This time, the hero is kind of an Indiana Jones type. (A basically good person who has faults and is willing to operate outside the law if he has to.) Van Helsing's allies are well placed. (The woman who carries a personality not so different from himself, and the side kick who is a little more innocent and nervous, but loyal and dedicated.) While many of us are used to the silent and frightening Frankenstein as portrayed in horror, the Frankenstein here is a little closer to the actual book. (Someone who is articulate and carries a deep sadness.) Dracula doesn't quite dominate the screen the way Frank Langella does, but again, this movie is more about Van Helsing. But Dracula does have an acceptable amount of screen time, and despite his evil, he has his charm. The scenery is not exactly up to Director Franco Zeffirelli, but it is memorable. I'm not one who really cares for special effects, but this is one rare case where the special effects flatter the events instead of distracting from them. I don't want to say too much and possibly ruin the movie for you, but they cleverly avoid the cliche happy ending. If you like this movie, I can suggest the following items as well. The book "Frankenstein" (1831) by Mary Shelley, the Lugosi version of "Dracula," (1931), "Horror of Dracula," (1958), and Frank Langella's "Dracula" (1979).</p></body></html>

Ben Affleck was effectively blind and dysfunctional as Daredevil; Christian Bale much less appealing (in my humble opine) as a wimpy Batman.  But when it comes to a super hero who can simultaneously kick arse and hold a guilt-ridden pity party, no one can hold a candle to sleek bombshell Jennifer Garner; not only that, she wears a red outfit that makes Viagra a mere breath mint, and she moves and grooves in ways that make ELEKTRA serve its very own call of the wild.<br /><br />The plot is campy and goofy, but name me a super hero plot that isn't.  Garner's Elektra is a professional assasin (what a way to go), only she's taken a gig she can't complete; meanwhile, she's pitted against some supernatural ninja-types (talk to the Hand) who share a commonality with her high-drama past.  She fights, she pouts, she swims to relieve her guilt, then--like all action heroes--she comes back from near-death to become an invincible villain mauler.<br /><br />Garner makes this film so much fun to watch; she's beautiful, graceful, exotic, and deadly, and I want to take my next vacation in her dimple.  Heck, in that outfit she could just stand in front of a camera and read the phone book; I would not be entertained any less.  Jennifer, sweetheart, you are my alltime favorite super hero as ELEKTRA.  And you've got the costume to prove it.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, Walk-On</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tragedy of the Dispossessed"></head><body><p>The Dispossessed<br />Early into the film I said to myself, "This is not going to end well." This movie, while dark, is deeply laden with symbolism and pathos and a relentless sense of impending doom. More than just a lament of the human condition, this is a meditation upon possessions and the fear of losing them that drives many of us to desperation. The house represents many different things to the different characters, but trying to possess the house and protect it spells disaster for all - those who fight for it and those caught in the crossfire.  The film borders on horror at times in that it exposes the fear and the despair that lead to murder and suicide.<p>The Colonel is at once the most malevolent but also the most tragic figure here. He realizes his hubris, but only too late. How many of our lives are marked by lies, keeping up appearances and desperate acts. Watch this film for nothing else than the phenomenal performances to which the Oscar nominations should attest. These are the roles of their careers for Kingsley and Connelly. Not for those who like light, tidy cinema. This film is profound and tragic. Only Kathy walks away from the house any wiser.</p></body></html>

I do remember ghosts and a fog; that's  about all. Picked it up at minimum price as I was on the check-out line at Borders today. Just one of those evenings when a ghost story seemed in order. Perhaps it was because yesterday, as I glanced over to a point about a half mile from where I stood, the tall buildings had their upper stories cloaked in, yes, truly, fog. Somewhat to  my surprise, as the first movie I have seen in a few months, it kept my attention until the final stages; always the toughest part to script in a film of this sort. Inevitably, there was a bit of a let-down for me,  though, obviously. not for many other viewers. All in all, I can recommend it for those who go for this kind of thing as a decent outing with little of the kind of cheap shot violence that takes the place of writing/directing skill.</p></body></html>

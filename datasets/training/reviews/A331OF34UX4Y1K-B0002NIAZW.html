Thw worst thing in this kind of disaster flick is that the producers try to give reasonable scientific background to explain all the absurds that happens in the film! That's annoying! Dennis Quaid's character would never get to New York.... And what abou that stupid "RACE AGAINST THE COLD"? Never saw something like that, it was so stupid that I must give credit to the producers. I laughed a lot.</p></body></html>

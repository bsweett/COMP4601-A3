<meta name="summary" content="THREE CHEERS FOR DIRECTOR GIBSON"></head><body><p>"A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within." This quote by Will Durant flashes on the screen at the beginning of APOCALYPTO and signals the message of the movie: a morally and economically troubled Mayan civilization is "rotten ripe for the fall", to quote another source, and the Conquistadors are landing on the Yucatan Peninsula to do the job. APOCALYPTO goes about showing us this rot that is a brutal, bloody, inhuman Mayan society while telling a classic action-chase tale. Jaguar Paw, a warrior in a small village, is captured by ruthless Mayan soldiers and taken back to the Mayan capital city to be sacrificed with others from his village on a pyramid. He manages to escape and is chased by Mayan fighters through the jungle.<br /><br />So much for the plot. What about the theme suggested by Will Durant? The film makes a good argument that the Mayans were vulnerable but even a morally sound, economically strong Mayan society could not have defeated the Spanish. Why? Because, while the Spanish were small in number, they had horses, muskets, steel swords, and head and chest armor. Not only that: the Spanish were just as ruthless as the Mayans. There was no way even a healthy Mayan civilization could have fended off the Spanish; it may have taken just a litle longer before the inevitable end.<br /><br />APOCALYPTO is brilliant movie-making and grand entertainment. Three cheers for director Mel Gipson. And forget what you've heard about bloody, sacrifical heart removals. This is a tiny part of the movie and is not nearly as bad as rumored.</p></body></html>

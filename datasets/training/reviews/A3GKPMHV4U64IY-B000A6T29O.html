<meta name="summary" content="Lara Croft Reborn"></head><body><p>Fans of the Tomb Raider games may grumble at the change in Lara's character.  In the original game, she had been ostracized by her family after her survival of a crash.  In the movie, she is a much-loved daughter, but orphaned.  But it still works.<p>The key to the games is problem solving.  In the movie, much of the problem solving is done off-screen so that it almost seems like Lara has all of the solutions already memorized.<p>A planetary conjunction is at the heart of the story.  The conjunction is the only time when the pieces of a fabulous device from an ancient civilization may be found.  An organization known as the Illuminati (based on the real group) is after the device.  Lara is sucked in when she uncovers a key her father left her.<p>The story travels the globe with lavish sets and more action than most.  From start to finish the action almost never stops and the story remains fairly true to the spirit of the games.<p>The disk comes packed with plenty of extras; deleted scenes, commentary, making of, effects, music video, etc.  Of course some of the making of information is untrue (obvious if you followed any of the stories during the making of the film), but are still fun to watch.</p></body></html>

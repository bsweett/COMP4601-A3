<meta name="summary" content="Just a great action film, A must buy for just the fight scenes. Awesome"></head><body><p>This film is a great action film, a must see if you love fight sceens.  A film that slipped by most radars in late 2002, Christian Bale (Batman Begins, Reign of Fire, the Machinist, American Psycho) plays a Graviton Cleric, a futeristic officer used to enfore the laws against sense crimes.  This movie is based off a "1984" plot in a post WWIII world in which people take a drug, prozium, to prevent feelings.  It also has the "Father" government figure as well.  It also carries a flavor of Ray Bradbury's Farenheit 451 as well.  Although this plot has been used and abused in the past, and again can be tiresome in this film, the action sceens in this film toast any prior film like this.  It starts off with arguably one of the best gun encounters in any movie, and goes on from there. The final scenerio is something that makes any guy feel like a ten year old, wanting to imitate the moves that the cleric does.  The camera work was also well done, and the sets were nice, not overdone with to much computer backgrounds.  Christian Bale plays the part exceptionally well, and Taye Diggs does fair as far as the action, but fails on the flattness of Affect needed in this role. His acting did seem to give the plot away early if you pick up on the hints quickly.  So if you want to see a good action movie, this is a must see. I believe it was this role that landed Christian Bale his role in Batman Begins, so if you like Batman, then you'll definitely like this.</p></body></html>

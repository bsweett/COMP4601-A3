<meta name="summary" content="Magnificient: Good Proof That Westerns Are Still Living"></head><body><p>Kevin Costner got everything with his first movie as director, lost it when he made the second, and then managed to regain it with the third, 'Open Range' which is not perfect, but still very involving film.  And that's a proof that Western movies are not dead yet.<br /><br />One good and sensible choice he made is that he top-billed Robert Duvall.  This always reliable veteran plays Boss, the leader of free-grazing group that includes his partner Charlie (Kevin Costner), big and kind-hearted Mose (Abraham Benrubi) and young and untamed Button (Diedo Luna).  They lead the life of free-spirited cowboy, grazing the cattle in the open range.<br /><br />But some people don't like these 'free grazers,' and the ruthless rancher Baxter (Michael Gambon, totally different from his turn in 'Harry Potter') is one of them.  When one of the cowboys fails to come back, and is found beaten up heavily in jail, Baxter makes it clear that Boss and his men are unwanted guest in town.  His town.<br /><br />The story goes like this, involving a female Sue (Annette Benning) as possible love interest, which I found perhaps unnecessary.  Ms. Benning is good, and the love is convincing, but I think the film streaches its premise too much.  Still,  the 2h20m film goes very smoothly with few let ups, until the final gun fight sequence which is one of the virtures of the film.<br /><br />There are three good things in 'Open Range'; One, great location of Canada, which is so beautiful and at the same time awe-inspiring as the snow-capped mountains show.  And in here, the rain could kill you.  Two, great acting, unianimously, but especially Robert Duvall, who could tell you everything about the character he plays only by standing.  Three, great gun fight, which is as fierce as any in the past, and retains authentic feeling.  In this film, when you shoot, you miss a lot.  Sometimes shooting looks awfully uncool, crouching under the objects or desperately firing the gun without hitting.  And perhaps that was what happened in many gun fights in the real history.<br /><br />Kevin Costner is always successful when he does Western, from the time of 'Silverado.'  And 'Untouchables' was a kind of Western in a modern, urban setting.  Even 'Wyatt Earp' was not all bad, though all too long.  Instead of the terrible '3000 Miles to Graceland,' he should do more of this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fairly Good Thriller Made Better by a good Bad Guy"></head><body><p>Gerard Butler makes for a very convincing villian in this little hyped thriller, "Law Abiding Citizen". Butler plays a Father whose family is brutally murdered. He goes on a very deliberate rampage against the deal-making District Attorney, played by Jamie Fox, who let one of the murderers off.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the cat and mouse game between the D.A. and the killer, who starts to wipe out every one who was involved with the murder of his family. The twist is that the killer is locked up in jail, arrested for the murder of the killers of his family. How is he killing from a jail cell and who is helping him are the big questions in the film.<br /><br />The movie is basically a locked door mystery. but it is entertaining although somewhat predictable. I was one of the few people who wanted to see this film while it was playing in a theatre, but that time period was only a few weeks. It seems like the movie studio had no faith in this film, which was a mistake in my opinion. I've seen alot worse, Law Abiding Citizen is worth seeing.</p></body></html>

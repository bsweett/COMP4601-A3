Take it a step further Steve Carrell gained prominence on "The Daily Show" and Christina Applegate cut her bones on "Married With Children".  This is a terrific Seventies satire capturing the mores and fashion of that time.  The film makes a point of highlighting institutionalized sexism but oddly glosses over racism but thats a minor quibble.  This may be Ferrell's greatest screen creation with his Burgundy an amalgam of hair, mustache, and pomposity.  Thought it was a nice touch naming his dog Baxter, a reference to the idiot news anchor, Ted Baxter, played by the late, great Ted Knight from "The Mary Tyler Moore Show".  Equally funny is his rival from another station played by Vince Vaughn is named Wes Mantooth which recalls the bland actor from "Emergency", Randolph Mantooth.  I saw this in the theatre in 2004 but it left no impression on me.  Watching it now I appreciate it as a milestone in modern comedy.  Time has caught up with Ron Burgundy and is very kind.</p></body></html>

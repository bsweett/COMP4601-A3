<meta name="summary" content="A gustatory journey through Paris"></head><body><p>Ratatouille, from Pixar and Brad Bird (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN4W">The Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009M9BK">The Iron Giant (Special Edition)</a>), is a rat's-eye view of the gastronomic delights of fine cuisine (the name itself is a pun on the classic French roast vegetable dish ratatouille). Remy is a young rat who discovers that he has a heightened sense of taste and smell, and becomes inspired by the late television chef Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett), whose motto "anyone can cook" now extends to rats, too. Remy begins to experiment with combining classic combinations of flavor and texture, herbs, and other ingredients, until his clan is forced to flee their country safehouse.<br /><br />During the traumatic escape, Remy is separated from his family. The ghost of Chef Gusteau appears to Remy when he is discouraged, inspiring him to cook at Gusteau's formerly-five star restaurant. The acid restaurant critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) made it his personal mission to write a scathing review of Gusteau's that stripped it of one of its Michelin stars, consigning it to the tourist trade. Now, the restaurant is under the iron fist of the shady, domineering Head Chef Skinner (Ian Holm). Remy befriends the bumbling, couldn't-boil-water-if-his-life-depended-on-it Alfredo Linguini, whom Skinner grudgingly adopted as the new garbage boy, and Remy and Linguini team up to create culinary delights that astound the normally staid French restaurant critics. Remy controls Linguini by hiding under his chef's toque and tugging on two strands of hair (the scenes of Remy perfecting his technique with a blindfolded Linguini wielding dangerous tools and messy ingredients are priceless). Toss in a handful of intrigue, kitchen highjinks, father-son bonding, a dash of romance with the formidable chef Colette, and plenty of culinary delights, and you have Ratatouille.<br /><br />The 3D animation is photorealistic, and 360 shots of nighttime Paris entrance. Small touches really capture the Bohemian feel of the Montmartre district, and the soundtrack features (brief) snippets of La Marseillaise, light and airy French themes, and French-language vocals by Camille (the standalone soundtrack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PKG7HK">Ratatouille</a> is available for purchase). As with The Incredibles, there's lots to keep kids engaged (although the scene with the window full of dead rats might be traumatic for very young kids), and a whole other layer of adult humor bubbling under the surface, so mom and dad will be able to enjoy Ratatouille with gusto.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mega Monster Mash-Up, Reloaded"></head><body><p>The Good Things<br />*Loads of slick special effects.<br />*Good cameramanship.<br />*Good production quality (good sets, costumes, designs, etc).<br />*Despite all the stereotypes and bad accents, the acting is passable.<br />*Storyline works and leaves much room for lots of upbeat adventure.<br />*There is a good number of nifty gadgets.<br />*Music is not bad.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*The main monster characters are not very well developed, and conform more to their given stereotypes. Dracula acts much like he did when Bella Lugosi played him. Frankenstein is a total drama queen. Wolfman is somewhat cool, but still shallow.<br />*The human characters are also not very well developed, and have incredibly hoaky accents.<br />*Van Helsing himself is a shallow Indiana Jones type character, and has very little to do with the original character from Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula."<br />*Everything is extremely cheesy.<br /><br />The concept is corny in itself; a combination of the top three movie monsters (Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolfman) in one big brawling adventure. As a story, it's mildly interesting. The characters are very lacking, showing nothing beneath their cliched surfaces. This film doesn't do any justice to the actors or the characters. The best thing is simply the action and special effects. It's simply better to turn your brain off, sit back, and enjoy the eye-candy. Probably best viewed during Holloween.<br /><br />The one-disc version has a few featurettes, a feature that allows you to explore the set, and some outtakes.  The two-disc set includes all of the same plus a few more featurettes (and for anybody who cares, some movie money for the next "Mummy" film).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An intense dark journey"></head><body><p>Frank Miller's "Sin City" is a bleak, foreboding cartoonish group of interlocking vignettes depicting the criminal element of corrupt Basin City.  The flick is stylishly filmed in predominantly black and white with occasional splashes of color to enhance the characters festooned against impressive computer generated backgrounds.  The influence of Quentin Tarantino, a guest director of the movie, is seen here, as the plot format is reminiscent of "Pulp Fiction".<br /><br />Pulp drama veteran Bruce Willis plays angina suffering cop Martigan who on the verge of retirement is compelled to rescue a kidnapped young girl from the clutches of Nick Stahl a psychotic rapist and killer.  The trouble is that Stahl is the son of corrupt Senator Roark, Powers Boothe and therefore protected.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke, whose style fits like a glove in ultra violent movies, plays career criminal, the seemingly indestructible Marv.<br />He seeks to avenge the murder of a gorgeous hooker Goldie played by the attractive Jaime King.  Goldie was the only gal to ever pay the fierce looking Rourke, made up with facial and mandibular prostheses, any attention.  He goes on a killing spree that includes Elijah Wood, the cannibalistic murderer of his precious Goldie.<br /><br />Clive Owen and Benicio del Toro star in another of the seemingly relentlessly violent stories.  Owen plays Dwight, the avenging angel of the gorgeous prostitutes of Oldtown.  The automatic weapon toting prostitutes represented by Rosario Dawson, Devon Aoki, and Alexis Bledel among others are allowed to govern their turf in a deal forged with the cops.  This truce is threatened when dirty cop del Toro and his boys make trouble in Oldtown and wind up getting dispatched.  Owen helps the ladies quash the evidence that could topple the delicate balance that exists.<br /><br />Miller's slick transformation of his graphic novels to the screen using an impressive and formidible cast created a graphic yet highly entertaining movie experience.</p></body></html>

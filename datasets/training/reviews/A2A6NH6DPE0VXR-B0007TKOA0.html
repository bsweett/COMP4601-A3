It's not even that funny. It's well acted though. I don't know why Paul Giamatti (Big Fat Liar, Planet of the Apes) wasn't nominated though. He probably deserved it more than Thomas Haden Church (Wings, 3000 Miles to Graceland ), athough he's great too.<br /><br />  It's about 2 wine tasters and bestfriends who go on one last trip together before Haden Church's character gets married. Church is a jerk though basically and just cares about getting laid before getting married more than spending time with Giamatti. Once he finds someone he doesn't tell her the truth and just uses her for sex. Well yes he does wanna hang with Giamatti and cheer him up. He'd still rather ditch him for a chinese lady he's cheating on his future wife with though.<br /><br />  It's Giamatti who you want things to work out for because he's the better guy . Well although he is a self-centered complainer that steals money from his mother. He still has some heart felt moments and has great chemestry  with Virginia Madsen (Candyman). I don't really know why the movie was praised so much. It's good but it reminded me a lot of Alexander Payne's last film About Schmidt. He goes on a road trip too but without the wine tasting or the sex. The pacing and the style are the same though.</p></body></html>

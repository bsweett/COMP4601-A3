<meta name="summary" content="excellent horror on blu ray"></head><body><p>This is not the best vampire movie ever made. The cover box claims this and that is certainly not the case.  However this is a excellent vampire horror movie that has a long pedigree in film.  This isn't a horror movie pedigree but instead the idea of a friendless outcast boy finding a friend or champion in a stronger person or in this case a vampire girl.  The story is well acted and I didn't mind  the english dubbing at all. They should have offered a subtitled version but that is not a real problem in enjoying this movie. And it is enjoyable with richly defined lead characters and good special effects.  Fans of fun and fast moving gross out movies who don't want a drama context and a solid story might not like this one. However  Those fans need to branch out though into this type of story driven horror flick too ,as they are excellent too.  This is a story that is like a fairy tale story of old in some ways. And those were bloody tales when they were first told too.  This movie focuses on the relationship between the two lead characters as much as the violence and horror.  This movie reminded me of the classic horror flick Beauty and the beast (the 1946 version) in it's careful attention to detail in characterization and that's a great horror movie from that period.  On blu ray this movie looks great which really brings out the excellent photography of the frozen swedish landscape of the story.  This is just a well done movie that even people who aren't horror fans can enjoy.</p></body></html>

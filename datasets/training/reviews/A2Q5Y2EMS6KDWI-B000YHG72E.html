<meta name="summary" content="Will Ferrell "elfs himself" to a new Holiday classic"></head><body><p>Who would've thought that Will Ferrell, Saturday Night Live alumni, would be the one to create a new Christmas classic? Thanks to the wide-eyed silliness of Ferrell, the deftly smart direction of Jon Favreau, and a cleverly funny & heartfelt script, "Elf" turns out to be a real delight. In a decade awash with disappointing Holiday films, this one truly earns the title of "brand new Holiday classic".<br />And the whole cast is good: James Caan as Buddy the Elf's gruff, cynical father who's lost touch with his true spirit; Mary Steenburgen gives solid support as Caan's wife; Bob Newhart lends his dour, low-key presence as Head Elf; Zooey Deschanel as Buddy's love interest, a rather cynical & untrusting department store worker; and Ed Asner as a sort of world-weary Santa. But ultimately, this is Ferrell's movie all the way, as his sweetly innocent but comical Buddy navigates his way through the gritty jungle of New York City, and eventually succeeds in re-connecting the town with its lost Holiday spirit.<br />Both an engaging tale & a charming satire of Christmas movies, "Elf" is definitely one of my favorites to watch around Christmastime!</p></body></html>

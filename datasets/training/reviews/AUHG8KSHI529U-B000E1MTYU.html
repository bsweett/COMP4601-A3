Not as great as the first 2."></head><body><p>When I first heard about this movie I wondered what in the world they were going to do with the plot.  The first one was fresh and has become a touchstone of the popular culture.  The second one had so many wonderful and fantastic effects that you can forgive the plot for being a tweaked version of the first (with really cool tweaks).  Well, what they did was remove most of the requirement for a plot by making the killing machine absolutely relentless, hopelessly advanced, and who has maybe 100 words in the whole movie.  She is just there to chase and kill and then be squashed.  Kristanna Loken is effective in this role, but I don't find her as menacing as Robert Patrick was.  Her face is so controlled that you never get a sense of power.  You SEE the power and she is playing a machine after all, but there you have it.<p>Arnold reprises his role as a third identical robot (as close as you can be to identical 10 years down the road) and he does it quite well.  But he too is given few words.  Some of the jokes he gets are pretty good, but a couple of them are groaners.<p>The stunts are visually very powerful, but the bigger your screen the better they will look.  Some of them are so large that the actors almost disappear on a small TV screen.  <p>Nick Stahl is OK as a whacked out John Connor, but he seems to be panting in every scene.  Does he have a breathing problem?  Clair Danes is the best thing in the movie.  She is terrific.<p>The DVD extras are OK. There is a pretty funny scene where Arnold plays the soldier who was used as the model for the robot soldiers that became the terminators.  I don't know if it was made for the movie and taken out or just made as a joke, but it is memorable, but would have drastically altered the tone and pace of the movie as it is.  There are out takes, a special on the action figures for adults that is weirdly commercial but interesting at the same time, some stuff on the T3 video game, the HBO show that you have probably already scene and the customary voice over tracks by the director and another with some of the actors.<p>I enjoyed the movie and realize it isn't as powerful as the first two.  For what it tried to be it is very well done.  We hoped for more and were a bit disappointed that we weren't blown away.  But as I have thought about what is really there, I think it is OK for what it aimed at being.</p></body></html>

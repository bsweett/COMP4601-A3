Poseidon"></head><body><p>I didn't bother seeing this movie in the theatres since I'd heard so much negative word-of-mouth about it from the few people I knew who saw it.  I've always been a huge fan of the original THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE ('72) and still watch it every New Year's Eve the way some people will watch IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE for Christmas.<br /><br />But I did buy the 2-disc DVD.  Part of the reason for justifying this was that I was buying the extras, especially a documentary from the History Channel about rogue waves.<br /><br />As far as the movie goes, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be...but that's hardly an enthusiastic "thumbs up" either.  I kept thinking Roger Ebert's word to sum it up: "perfunctory."  That works for me.<br /><br />It's as if Hollywood has taken the screenwriting process away from the writers and handed it over to the folks who design amusement park rides.<br /><br />Movies are now calculated to rush your senses and ignore your inner organs...like your brain and your heart.  Just keep those pupils dilating and reflexes jumping.<br /><br />My biggest major beef with POSEIDON was the movie's choice to jettison what I felt was the coolest aspect of the original: it wasn't just a survival story, it was a metaphor for Life itself.<br /><br />The original film said, "In an upside-down world, a rebellious religious leader leads a small group of believers UP while everyone else is going DOWN."<br /><br />The remake says, "We're just going to whack people every few mintues--but, man, it's gonna look so cool!"<br /><br />THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE told its story and its appeal has lasted over thirty-five years (and will live on).<br /><br />POSEIDON hit DVD three months after its release and will probably be piled in a clearance bin by the end of this year.<br /><br />Will Hollywood figure it out?  I doubt it.<br /><br />I don't blame the actors (like a lot of reviews here) because it all comes down to writing, writing, writing.<br /><br />I didn't care about any of these characters.  Not a one.  Think about the way the audience felt when a character died in the original (especially Gene Hackman's powerful scene of losing Mrs. Rosen).  POSEIDON never worked on that level.<br /><br />The music biz made a big deal that Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas has a cameo...but I thought she looked and sounded like Charo--coochie, coochie! (Talk about a bad Love Boat flashback!).<br /><br />The special effects provided some good moments, especially the sequence of the tidal wave capsizing the ship.  As usual, the only good thing Hollywood films these days can be praised for are their special effects...and little else.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the original, CHECK IT OUT.  I've talked to a lot of young people who haven't seen it and didn't feel like watching the same movie again.<br /><br />I tell them two things:<br /><br />Even if you saw POSEIDON, then you didn't see THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.<br /><br />And, yes, it's in color.</p></body></html>

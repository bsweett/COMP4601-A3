<meta name="summary" content="Clearly The Gingerbread Man Does Not Sit On The MPAA Ratings Board"></head><body><p>Thoroughly entertaining all the way through. Deliberately campy at times, but overall a pretty good flick.<br /><br />The $20 question is: Is this movie worth the price of purchase versus a rental? Let's see:<br /><br />-Two big stars...Matt Damon (plays Will...no not Good Will in this one) and Heath "Brokeback Mountain" Ledger (Jake).<br />-A great plot line...Will and Jake are con-artists that execute Scooby-Doo style pranks on various communities, but meet their match when they encounter a genuine fairy-tale curse and are commissioned to vanquish it.<br />-Many snippits of the famous Brothers Grimm tales are cleverly woven into the movie (The Gingerbread Man, Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Snow White, Hansel and Gretel, etc).<br /><br />But clearly director Terry Gilliam was torn between putting out a PG or a PG-13 movie. The deliberate silliness that I mentioned earlier, especially the portrayal of Cavaldi by the great character actor Peter Stormare (you know, the guy that sticks Steve Buscemi in the wood chipper in Fargo) takes away from any attempt at serious that the movie had. And all of the fairy tale references suggest that a movie for kids may have once been in mind.<br /><br />But genuinely frightening and nightmarish images were too much for the ratings guys at the MPAA and they threw the 13 on the end of the PG to make sure that our children were kept safe from the make believe fairy tale world of The Brothers Grimm.<br /><br />So back to the $20 question. This movie is not a keeper. It is, however, an excellent rental. Let kids watch it? That's up to you, parents, knowing that the MPAA says anyone under 13 may be damaged from viewing this picture about the Brothers that created stories for kids to scare kids.</p></body></html>

I'm still not quite sure what was so radical about the "new way" Pitt's Billy Beane character selected players, as he just seemed to think outside the box a little more often than his scouts and advisors did, but then I'm not a huge baseball expert.  I did enjoy that it was a sports movie that was generous in its subtlety and light on simplistic moments of triumph.  The skillful, effective balance of heart and smarts helped, too.</p></body></html>

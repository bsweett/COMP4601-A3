<meta name="summary" content="The extra footage explains a lot..."></head><body><p>15 extra minutes doesn't sound like much, but it really improved this film.  I think the theatrical version didn't do as well because it took a character people were familiar with (from Pitch Black) and expanded it to the nth degree without any background explanation!  What makes a "Furian" so special? Where the heck did Necromongers come from! These 15 minutes go a long way to fleshing it out (not to mention the deleted scene with Aereon that should've gone in the director's cut). A new character is included in the footage that gives insight to the Furians and the extras provide a deeper mythos for the Riddick world, making you beg for a sequel.<br /><br />Critics panned Diesel's performance, but really, was Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting in the Terminator any better?  No.  Diesel acts as well as any other "action" star--see this movie for the action and adrenaline, not an oscar performance. Buy it!<br /><br />One thing: the movie begins with an introduction by the director explaining that when new/expanded scenes appear there will be some disruption to the scene.  I never noticed anything of the sort.  The movie flowed seemlessly.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fun Sci-Fi Mystery"></head><body><p>In the not too distant future, robots are a normal part of life, doing menial tasks and taking care of humans.  With built in rules to make sure they never become dangerous, everyone is happy.<br /><br />Except Del Spooner.  A police detective, he has an innate distrust of machines.  So when his friend and the inventor of robots turns up dead, Del immediately suspects a robot.  When no one takes him seriously, he turns to Susan Calvin for help.  But is he correct?  If so, can he prove the truth and saves humans?<br /><br />This is a fun movie.  It's meant to entertain, and it does it in spades.  The plot is cleaver with some nice clues thrown in to keep the viewer engaged.  And the car chases and action scenes keep you on the edge of your seat.  I'm not a super big Will Smith fan, mainly because of the movies he's chosen to do in the past.  But here he did a great job playing a detective with something to prove even when no one else believes him.<br /><br />This movies sets out to be nothing more then an escapist thrill ride.  And it succeeds in spades.  Perfect for a couple hours of entertainment.</p></body></html>

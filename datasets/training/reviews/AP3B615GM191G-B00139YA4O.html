<meta name="summary" content="Introducing The Characters"></head><body><p>Before I begin my review of this show's actual content, let me make one thing perfectly clear: LOST is the greatest sci-fi/drama show I have ever watched. Now, this is saying something, as I am also a huge fan of Star Trek and The X-Files. From the first episode, however, LOST hooked me in with its mysterious plots, emotional drama, and flash-back storytelling method.<br /><br />In a nutshell, LOST tells the story of a group of people who survived a plane crash and now find themselves on a deserted island, with little chance for rescue. Yet, this show is NOT a dramatic version of Survivor. Producer J.J. Abrams makes this clear right from the get-go, as on the first night on the island a dinosaur-sounding monster invades the group's camp and adds a mysteriousness to the entire situation. From there, the survivors come into contact with a polar bear, a French woman who has been broadcasting an SOS on the island for many years, and a metal hatch buried deep in the ground. Obviously, the island is not as "innocent" as it would seem.<br /><br />Besides the X-Files-like plot twists (but LOST actually executes its plot better than the X-Files because it always follows up on all key plot elements), the stories of a selected group of the plane crash survivors add the emotional drama to the show. By flashing-back to their lives before the clash, it is revealed how certain characters wound up on the plane to begin with. Also, the undercurrent beneath every flash-back implies that each "Lostie" is somehow connected to each other, and perhaps they are even "brought" to their mysterious island for a particular reason. I would go into more details about some of the survivors' flashbacks, but too many spoilers would abound if I did. Suffice it to say that you WILL be emotionally "hooked" by each and every one of their stories, and your emotion will be compounded by the surprise endings (almost Twilight Zone-esque) of most of the flashbacks.<br /><br />To conclude, LOST is the perfect blend of emotional drama, intense action, and mind-bending mystery. This first season primarily serves to introduce the important characters (through the ingenious flash-back method) and scratch the surface of the mysteries the island has to offer. If you purchase this produce, I recommend buying the second season right now as well, as you WILL NOT want to wait after this season's cliffhanger ending.</p></body></html>

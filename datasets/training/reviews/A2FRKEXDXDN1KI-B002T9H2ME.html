<meta name="summary" content="Blu-ray: Fantastic!  A wonderful performance from Sam Rockwell and an exciting, gripping psychological thriller!"></head><body><p>"Moon", the 2009 sci-fi independent film written and directed by Duncan Jones is a multi-award winning film which was shot for $5 million.  Featuring a screenplay adaptation by Nathan Parker, composer Clint Mansell ("Blood: The Last Vampire", "Doom", "Sahara") and cinematography by Gary Shaw ("Space Chase").<br /><br />The film received positive reviews from critics and had a limited release in a few theaters worldwide but the film made over $7 million worldwide and now the film receives its Blu-ray and DVD release stateside on Jan. 12, 2010.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"Moon" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) and with a budget of only $5 million for a sci-fi indie film (compared to "Sunrise", another indie sci-film made for $50 million), you can only wonder how the crew was going to pull this one off and sure enough, they managed quite well.<br /><br />Picture quality is quite solid as you can see the rocks and craters in the lunar surface with a very good amount of detail.  The CG work is quite impressive and skin tones are natural with one of the Sam's looking really sick and pale, while blacks are nice and deep.  You can see the skin pores and bruises of Sam Bell, blood stains on the skin to the stains and post-it note residue that can be seen on the surface of GERTY.  A good amount of detail inside the lunar base and outside in the lunar surface.<br /><br />There is a fine layer of grain and for the most part, the filmmakers managed to make things work with the budget that they had.  I was very impressed with the lunar sequences and the CG work.<br /><br />As for the lossless audio, audio is presented in English, French, Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1. Dialogue from Sam and GERTY are clear and understandable.  The soundtrack is very well done as you can hear the rovers and the harvesters on the lunar surface.  Each boom goes quite nicely via LFE and scenes that include surround and rear surround usage.<br /><br />The film really has a good amount of kick through the bass featured in the special effects and one can expect their subwoofer(s) to be put into use with this film.  Music by Clint Mansell is well done and definitely sets the mood for the scenes in the movie.  But for the most part, I was very amazed by the lossless soundtrack for this independent sci-fi film.  Well done!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"Moon" comes with the following special features in standard definition, English stereo and Spanish & Portuguese subtitles:<br /><br />  * Commentary with Writer/Director Duncan Jones, Director of Photography Gary Shaw, Concept Designer Gavin Rothery and Production Designer Tony Noble - An upbeat commentary that is more about the technical side of the film and the guys joking around about certain scenes.

This film really rivals a lot of the big budget sci-fi films through a wonderful performance by Sam Rockwell.  The fact that he has to act with himself and making sure the two are similar people but different in circumstances because one has been in space for three years alone, while the other has been there for only a week is pretty interesting.  Again Rockwell is amazing in this film.  Kevin Spacey's voice as GERTY definitely gave the film an eerie feeling and for the most part, it's the visual surrounding of the film and how the visual effects really played apart in creating that lonely lunar atmosphere was well-done.<br /><br />In fact, there are so many times throughout the film that I thought we were going to get the Solaris craziness, or crazy robot ala "2001: A Space Odyssey" or humans just losing it in space ala "Sunshine" and "Armageddon".  But Duncan Jones who was influenced by sci-fi films from the 70's and 80's really did a solid job of creating a film that may have borrowed some themes (or pay homage) from those classic sci-films but managed to make "Moon" his own sci-fi film.<br /><br />The whole concept of Helium-3 and harvesting it for energy for Earth was quite intriguing but also to learn that even in space, corporate greed is still in full-effect and the concept of long distance relationship (from Earth to the moon) was well-written.  And a few other important things that are part of the film that I don't want to spoil for anyone but Duncan Jones did a really good job in bringing his story to the big screen.<br /><br />And even with the $5 million dollar budget, I suppose I was not expecting too much from the film and thought everything would be shot outdoors.  But set design was pretty solid and the CG work, absolutely awesome looking and it all looks vibrant and detailed on Blu-ray.  And it was great to know there were a good number of special features including two major Q&A's included on this release.<br /><br />Overall, "Moon" was more than I expected and that is a great thing.  The film featured a solid performance by both Rockwell and Spacey, a solid screenplay and the right people to make this film look very awesome!<br /><br />An awesome independent sci-fi film and psychological thriller worth watching and even worth owning!  Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

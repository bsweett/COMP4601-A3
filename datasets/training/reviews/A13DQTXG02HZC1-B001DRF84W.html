<meta name="summary" content="A misunderstood movie"></head><body><p>I am more interested in the making of this movie more than the movie itself.  When it was revealed that Ang Lee was to direct this blockbuster, few eye-brows were raised of the choice.  If we sit through the making of the film, it was explained that he's needed to bring sense and sensibility to one of Marvel Comic's most successful franchise.  In the end, we end up with a movie that is neither nor.  It's just the way it is and expectedly, fingers are pointed.  Rumours started to spread about cast and production crews were tense working under a Director who was tunnel-visioned in actualising his vision (nothing wrong with that).  The making of the movie also divulged to us Ang Lee's donning of rubbery suits with sensors on them to feed datas to ILM's software to create the Hulk that he envisioned, & his involvements in the music creation (Ang Lee kept reminding Danny Elfman that his music score should be less Danny Elfman's).  For Ang Lee, the making of this movie is a challenge, to tackle something that he hasn't tackled before. For him, that means trying to merge the art of comics with the art of films and trying to portray the characters here in a three dimensional manner rather than cutboard characters from comics.  Ang Lee endeavoured to give us an insight into Banner and his alter-ago, his tulmutous relationship with his father (played brilliantly by Nick Nolte) who was really a mad scientist who played God, the forbidden love between Banner and Ross (Jennifer Connelly's character).  Sam Elliot was brilliant as a General who was dead-heat in pursuing and terminating Hulk.  He's not a Captain Ahab of Moby Dick's fame but rather, a humane General who was simply doing his job, to the resentment of his daughter, Ross who wanted to reconcile the relationship between the daughter and the father.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I respect the fact that a lot of thoughts and efforts have gone into making this a commendable adult comic movie.  I guess as a result, it becomes the victim of its own success.  People commented about the incredulity of Hulk flying on the air, of him jumping for joy in the Grand Canyon, not being faithful to the comics offering, of the unrealistic projection of the CGI Hulk.  However, if people can see beyond the fact that the CGI is simply a part of the total sum, then, people would start to appreciate how tragic this movie actually is.  This is a undeniably an ambitious movie.  I think Ang Lee has achieved his brief of making an adult movie out of a comic strips but majority of the audience actually wants a candy pop no brainer action movie.  All I can say is that the studio has misread the sentiment of the public and the fault is not with Ang for he did his bit brilliantly, perhaps, too brilliantly.  Commendable effort.</p></body></html>

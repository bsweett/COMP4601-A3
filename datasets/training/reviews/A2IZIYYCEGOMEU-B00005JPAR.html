<meta name="summary" content="Poetic Mysticism"></head><body><p>Aronofsky's FOUNTAIN plays with the Fountain of Youth myth that the Spanish Conquistadores were so infatuated with, throws in a liberal dose of Eastern mysticism, a smattering of ever-lasting-love ( a thousand years ), and on top of that, a few interruptions in space, and time. One might expect the result to be a turgid, incomprehensible mess. In a lesser director's hands, such probably would have been the case, however, I found this particular sci-fi to be effortlessly lyrical, heartbreakingly poignant, and artistically on a par with Jeunet, and Caro's CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, and Burger's THE ILLUSIONIST.<br /><br />Jackman (as Thomas), and Weisz (as Isabel-Izzy) are both superb as lovers caught on the wheel of time, reincarnated, and adversely fated to suffer the same misfortune for a thousand years. Thomas' quest for the 'Tree-of-Life' to save the love of his life, and Isabel's staunch belief in him even in the face of her own death(s) are touching, and as magical as the Bubble-ship that the twenty-sixth century version of the then mad Thomas travels to Xibalba in.<br /><br />On the whole, there is more Shakespeare, and Marlowe in this film than science. The camerawork, lighting, and sets were phenominal.</p></body></html>

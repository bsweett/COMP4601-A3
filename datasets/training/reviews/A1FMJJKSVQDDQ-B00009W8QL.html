Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker, and Kiefer Sutherland are amazing here, and the movie itself was a blast to watch. There were certain moments that needed some work (like the odd introduction to the movie), but other than that, it's still a very good thriller. I indeed had a fun time watching it.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></body></html>

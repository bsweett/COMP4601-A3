<meta name="summary" content="The film you were not allowed to see!"></head><body><p>Released by MGM, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer, October 24, 1962.<br />  Rainy day: Please see this film from beginning to the very end without any distraction or interruption.  This is a very important and intelligent film.<br />  On DVD "Main Options", notice the card Frank Sinatra is holding.  Showing the back side and changing to Queen of Diamonds.<br />  Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) has just returned from Korea.  At the airport is a grand fanfare put on by his head-strong mother (Angela Lansbury) whoose husband, John Iselin (James Gregory) is campaigning to be the next President in the White House.  Raymond despises his mother, but she has this "control" over him. He is an adult and has been through war, but she still "controls" him with verbal command. She also is handling her husband's campaign very closely even giving him, in a clever unseen way to others, the exact way to answer a question.<br />  Meanwhile, Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) has a dream that he and his other combat buddies are at a garden tea party meeting hosted by a Chairlady (Helen Kleeb, [The Waltons tv series]).  The dream changes to the men sitting at a seminar hosted by Dr. Yen Lo (Khigh Dhiegh).  Dr. Lo asks Raymond, while all are brainwashed, to kill Ed (Richard LePore). Major Marco suddenly wakes up screaming from his dream. He is dripping in sweat. Major Marco decides to investigate if his other soldiers are experiencing the same frightful dream. Was it a dream or are they now beginning to rememeber.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Janet Leigh, Henry Silva, James Edwards, Douglas Henderson, John McGiver, Jocelyn Jordan, Lloyd Corrigan, Joe Adams, Bess Flowers, Tom Lowell.<br /><br />Academy Award Nominations: Best Supporting Actress, Angela Lansbury, Best Film Editing.<br /><br />DVD is in full screen on one side, Wide-screen on the other side.<br />  Audio Commentary by John Frankenheimer.<br />Special 1988 interview with Frank Sinatra, John Frankenheimer, George Axelrod.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra pulled this film out of further release because of the assassination of our President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, November 22, 1963, as you will understand why after seeing this film all the way through.<br />  Kennedy's accused assassin was Lee Harvey Oswald who was then assassinated by Jack Ruby on his way to trial.  Oddly, their are references in this film to "John" as well as President Abraham Lincoln who was assassinated, April 14, 1865.<br /><br />***Did Oswald see the film The Manchurian Candidate (1962)?***<br /><br />No other film in history has had such an impact on the American public as this one, especially after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and remember, this movie was filmed and released before his tragic unexpected death occurred.<br /><br />  Frank Sinatra re-released this film in 1987 and was also shown on pay-per-view television.<br />  Frank Sinatra personally chose Lucille Ball for the role of the mother, however the role ultimatly went to Angela Lansbury.<br />  One source had the honor of seeing a "special exhibition" print and he swears this special print showed the big Queen of Diamonds costume with red over black.  This print is not available on VHS nor DVD.<br /><br />  Terrible remake: The Manchurian Candidate (2004) with Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber.</p></body></html>

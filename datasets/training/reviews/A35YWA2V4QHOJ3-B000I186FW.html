The "hero" is a dark vigilante type character who has been victimized by "the system."  He is out for revenge, and the powers-that-be in the upper echelons of government had better take heed!<br /><br />Natalie Portman is gorgeous.  Heck, she even looks great bald.  She also has a lot of potential as an actress.  She is perfect as the dark hero's side-kick.  Hugo Weaving is terrific as the vigilante.  He shows off the distinctive voice that we were introduced to in THE MATRIX series.<br /><br />On some level, this movie seems to be a subtle attack at the Bush administration and all of the steps it has taken to absorb more power and subtract any sort of congressional oversight.  Cutting away civil liberties in hopes of gaining more security is almost never a good idea. The totalitarian paradigm of "the ends justify the means of extreme government" is as alive and well today it has always been.  Just a thought.....<br /><br />In any case, this is a thrilling (albeit dark)  movie that is sure to be a worthwhile addition to your DVD collection.  When the leader of a country becomes the "bad guy" we're all in peril.  That is one lesson that will forever remain unchanging.</p></body></html>

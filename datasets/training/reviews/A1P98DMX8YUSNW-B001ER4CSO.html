<meta name="summary" content="A noisy fight-fest"></head><body><p>This is one of the noisiest fantasy films I've seen, the soundtrack all crashes and smashes and busting glass almost constantly throughout. The visuals are a feast, though, with much more going on than in many films of this genre. I'm not a big fan of Ron Perlman's Hellboy character, since he's the only one that looks really fake. The plot and the dialogue are secondary to the look. If you enjoy these types of comic book movies, this one should not disappoint, though it's exhausting to keep up with all the non-stop action.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="EXACTLY AS EXPECTED"></head><body><p>With a name like "Hot Tub Time Machine" I didn't expect a sophisticated movie. I expected a 1980's style sex comedy with gratuitous nudity, potty humor, and a couple of good jokes. That is exactly what you get. Four people with dead end miserable lives go to a resort 3 of them once stayed at back in 1986. The go with the intent to cheer up Rob Corddry, who they believed attempted suicide, when really he just did something stupid. The place is ran down and not as they remembered. While drinking in the hot tub they get transported back into time. Chevy Chase makes an appearance as Hot Tub repair man and hints that they need to do everything the same tonight, or else they might alter the future. Attempting to remember all the bad and good things that happened that night, they go out to reproduce it, finding it equally hard to not to change the past as it is to change it. The movie includes music from 1986 as well as frequent drug use, drinking, and sex. Chevy Chase's role is almost cameo. A great movie to watch with the guys and have a few beers as long as you are higher than your expectations.</p></body></html>

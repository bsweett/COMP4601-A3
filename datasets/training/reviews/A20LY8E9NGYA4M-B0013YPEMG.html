<meta name="summary" content="&quot;BATMAN&quot; SHOWS HOW A COMIC SUPERHERO FILM SHOULD BE DONE."></head><body><p>Even if &quot;Superman&quot; is a decent movie, Batman is the real thing; Tim Burton created an ultra-stylized film, and his dark version of the superhero paid tribute to the true spirit of the comics, instead of using the style of the TV comedy series; in my opinion that was the right choice.<br /><br /> This film is also the best of the series; when Tim Burton and Michael Keaton left this movie franchise after &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, the quality of the rest of the films was pretty poor. In &quot;Batman&quot; there are a lot of things to enjoy: good performances (Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson of course, Kim Basinger and Jack Palance, to name a few), good music, great sets, ultra cool gadgets (the Batmovile is amazing) and a very interesting story.<br /><br /> A comic superhero film is not an easy to make, but Tim Burton proved to be the right choice in this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lackluster Movie Based Upon a Lackluster Book."></head><body><p>Like tens of millions of other people, I read THE DA VINCI CODE to see what the hype was all about.  As a book, THE DA VINCI CODE really isn't that great.  The writing is not very tight, the dialogue is rather cheesy, and the characters have about as much personality as cardboard.  The book is far inferior in both style and substance to its predecessor, ANGELS AND DEMONS.  Despite these drawbacks, the book is a mega-bestseller and when a movie adaptation was announced, it had all the signatures to be a major blockbuster:  Ron Howard was signed on to direct, Tom Hanks was signed to star with Ian McKellen signed as part of the supporting cast, and a huge budget (somewhere around $150-$200) to support the project.  The movie was veiled in secrecy and no preview screenings were allowed.  Most of the buzz was that it was going to be the must-see movie of the year.<br /><br />Yet, there was some other noise being made, too.  There were those in the industry who were warning that there was so much secrecy not because of the controversy surrounding the film, but because the movie really wasn't all that great.  The naysayers were right because THE DA VINCI CODE turned out to be nothing more than a lackluster film based on a less than lackluster novel.<br /><br />The film's plot basically follows the plot of the book.  Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a visiting professor of symbology visiting Paris.  An art historian and curator at the Louvre is murdered and Langdon is implicated in the plot.  His awareness of what's going on becomes aroused when a French agent, Sophie Neveu, explains to him that he's the one suspected of murder.  The murdered man turns out to be her grandfather and he left messages that let Sophie know she has to help Langdon.  They team up and begin a cross country midnight adventure that takes them from France to England and back to France again.  Along the way, Langdon and Neveu are joined with the brilliant and handicapped Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) who reveals to Neveu the real cover-up that's going (that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children together).<br /><br />Tom Hanks is normally a brilliant actor whether doing drama or comedy.  However, in THE DA VINCI CODE he seems subdued.  I'm not sure if it's because Langdon isn't much of a character or if Hanks was just doing this movie for the paycheck, though it's probably a combination of the two.  Ron Howard has become a great director, but whatever tricks he's learned making such films as APOLLO 13, A BEAUTIFUL MIND, and CINDERELLA MAN were totally thrown out the window with THE DA VINCI CODE because just about anyone who knows how to operate a digital camera could have made the same movie.  The novel really isn't that a great of a book and the movie is even a worse movie.  In fact, the only redeeming thing about the film is Ian McKellen.  McKellen gives a worthwhile performance and is the only person who actually seems to be alive in the movie.  It's kind of bad in a murder-mystery-action picture if the only interesting person in the movie is the old, rich guy who has to have a walker to get around.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="My childhood favorite!"></head><body><p>This has always been one of my favorite movies! It is a true classic, and I have seen it so many times that I have lost count. A bunch of kids go on a treasure hunt, with a bunch of bad guys on their tails. Great action-adventure film for all ages! If you haven't seen it, see it soon. I cannot wait for the DVD release, which contains deleted scenes, and a music video of the Cyndi Lauper song, "Goonies R Good Enough". It also contains a commentary track featuring a majority of the cast members! Goodie, goodie.</p></body></html>

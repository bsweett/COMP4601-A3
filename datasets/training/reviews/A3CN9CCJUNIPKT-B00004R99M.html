<meta name="summary" content="The books are better"></head><body><p>I wasn't raised as a Disney kid, so I was only peripherally aware of this film growing up, maybe saw some of it on TV a time or two, but never in the movie theatres or from start to finish.<br /><br />Recently, however, my kid and I read the first four "Mary Poppins" books and were thoroughly charmed by their odd, acerbic humor. So I thought, hmmmm, maybe we should try the movie as well, even though I knew, vaguely, that the Julie Andrews MP was much different than the mysterious faerie-nanny we had come to know from the books. Although the Disney Poppins isn't entirely sugary-sweet, she is much more benevolent and feel-good than the grouchy, cross nanny in the books. Also, though I love Dick Van Dyke dearly, having his character Bert in the film from start to finish is a big change (Bert only appears in two or three stories in the books) and he often overwhelms the rest of the film.  The Banks family is also greatly altered - instead of a spaced-out humbug, the father becomes a foreboding, socially retrograde prig, while the mother (also a space cadet in the books) is made more sympathetic, a foil for the crabby dad. (And the interjection of her being politically active, as a  voting rights suffragette, seems oddly out of place: the books were never about the parents, and they are made much more central here...)<br /><br />There is some innovative animation and creative, imaginative visualizing of the story, but far too many alterations and new material created out of whole cloth to suit a "Mary Poppins" purist, which I guess I am.  Since we love the books so much, I previewed this film alone, and I think I'll hold off for a few years before we give it a whirl as a family: I really think it would ruin the magic of the Travers text, and replace it with something much simpler, much cheaper, and far less wondrous.

<meta name="summary" content="Marvelous job by Penn, Hirsch, Vedder, and others"></head><body><p>Even at 2 1/2 hours, this film does not drag or slow down at all.  It keeps you mesmerized the entire time as you watch the unfolding story of Chris McCandless, who burned his Soc. Sec. card, gave his money away, changed his name, and left West Virginia to trek across the U.S., with a life in the wilds of Alaska as his main goal.  Along the way, he meets a kindly hippie couple and a hippie girl that he might have stayed with had she been older; a lonely old man, played wonderfully by Hal Holbrook, who wants to adopt Chris; and a farmer who teaches him how to work in the fields.  Sadly, Chris's life ends when he eats a poisonous plant that he mistook for a safe one, and he starves to death inside an abandoned bus.<br />The one thing I wish Chris would have done was realize sooner that he needed other people and that it wasn't all about him all the time.  Also, he could have at least sent a postcard now and then to his parents and sister to let them know how he was doing.  However, this is not a flaw in the film.  It's the way things happened.  Penn does a marvelous job of directing, while Emile Hirsch ought to be nominated for his unpretentious, straightforward portrayal of Chris.  Eddie Vedder, in particular, provides excellent songs for the soundtrack, which I believe is worth purchasing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not Typical Jack Black Comedy; Still Good In Its Curiously Amusing Way"></head><body><p>`Nacho Libre' stars Jack Black, but you shouldn't expect the typical Jack Black comedy from this film, That means if you like him in `High Fidelity' or `School of Rock,' you may not find his character and the movie itself to your taste. `Nacho Libre' is so-called love or hate movie, and surely it has weirdly funny (so I found) moments.<br /><br />[JACK BLACK IN MEXICO] Jack Black plays a Mexican priest named Ignacio. What he does mainly is cooking in the orphanage, but his true dream has been to become a professional wrestler. So one day after teaming up with a skinny and agile Mexican street urchin Esqueleto (H&eacute;ctor Jim&eacute;nez), he dons a red cape and puts on a blue mask, and calls himself Nacho Libre.<br /><br />There are suggested love interest, Sister Encarnaci&oacute;n (beautiful Ana de la Reguera, who uncannily resembles Winona Ryder), and friendship with the orphaned kids. The story itself is not surprising, and it leads us very fast to the conclusion that could be predicted from miles away. But that will not bother you. What is remarkable is the way Nacho's life is presented, with the laidback pace and low-key direction from Jared Hess, whose comic timing has a very original touch. The unique characters including JB's often stand quietly before the camera before doing or saying something extraordinary.<br /><br />Actually most of the (Mexican) actors play eccentric people, and their eccentricity is expressed in the details about them. Look at the two little wrestlers flying like monkeys; see how Nacho's friend Esqueleto is wooed by a fat lady at a party; or read the words of Nacho Libre's  funny letter to Sister Encarnaci&oacute;n. Speaking of whom, unsuspecting and pure-hearted Sister Encarnaci&oacute;n may be the strangest person in the film, who does not seem to notice the weird situations surrounding her.<br /><br />But Nacho Libre, Sister Encarnaci&oacute;n and other characters are doing what they do earnestly, taking themselves very seriously. They are all honest, and the film does not judge anyone, and accepts these strange characters as they are. The comic taste is not for everyone, to be sure, but you know the film's heart is in the right place.</p></body></html>

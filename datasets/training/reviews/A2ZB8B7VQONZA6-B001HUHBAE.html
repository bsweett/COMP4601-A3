For those who have read my other review [The Zodiac Killer-which was a good movie over all] about this fame seeking individual will know what I think of this chump. This seemed like a real event to me when I was watching it [as in the movie felt real, I know the events actually took place] since the atmosphere, writing, direction, and acting seemed to be in top order. For fans of serial killer movies and movie fans over all this is worth while flick that is purchase worthy in my opinion. Of course I am sure you all know what it is basically about, the killer right? Kinda<br /><br />While the movie is basically about this guy the true story lies within the people who covered the killings and the ones who investigated them. And even then it is not truly about those people it is about how it affected their lives and changed them. You may be saying well that means it is about them then, no because how it affected them is basically how it affected the whole area. This movie is about the impact this glory hound had on the population during this time, the book on which this is based is great by the way.<br /><br />Any way the film follows a couple of different people from the lead investigators to other police officers from different areas, and of course the newspaper employees who followed this case as well. It was interesting to see these people go through changes that altered their lives forever; some just gave up while stayed obsessed with the case. Director David Fincher who you may know from making other great films like "Seven and Fight Club" I believe does a great job with this movie. Although you will say to yourself at one point or another "this is a long movie" it still is a great viewing experience. James Vanderbilt's screenplay based on Robert Graysmith's book is wonderful and really brings the people on screen to life.<br /><br />Speaking of author Robert Graysmith he is played wonderfully by Jake Gyllenhaal whose obsession with the case drives him closer and closer to an answer he will never truly get. Maybe one day but as far as the book and film even though he believes he knows who the Zodiac is he will never truly get the answer as of now. Jake is great n this film and you can see the transformation of an everyday average guy to a man who becomes so obsessed that he alienates his own family. Mark Ruffalo is great as well playing Inspector David Toschi as is Anthony Edwards who plays Inspector William Armstrong. Both do great jobs in this film and are truly upset that they never caught their man.<br /><br />One of my favorite actors out there Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as usual playing Paul Avery. This guy goes from being one of the most confident people ever to being reduced to a shell of his former self, even though he ends up helping more then he thinks when Robert comes to see him. Another great performance comes in the form of John Carroll Lynch who plays the lead suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. Both these guys deliver well and add a lot to the film, glad both were cast in this. Still everyone that was in this movie deserves credit because all were good and deserve praise for their acting abilities.<br /><br />This is a little more held back as far as blood and stuff compared to the filmmakers previous films but that adds to the atmosphere in my opinion. This is a wonderful movie that I truly believe most would enjoy even if it feels a bit long. The only problem is that if you want some special features you have to buy the two disc version, this single disc has nothing on it really. Still if it is all you can find the movie alone is worth it, go rent, buy or what ever this movie.</p></body></html>

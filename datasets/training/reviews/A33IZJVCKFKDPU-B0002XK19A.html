<meta name="summary" content="Spider-Man Returns In Form"></head><body><p>When "Spider-Man" was released in 2002, I was amazed to see how good of a movie that Sam Raimi and writer David Koepp created about a comic book super hero.  Sony announced after seeing the huge box office sales that "Spider-Man 2" was set to release in 2004.  I was excited to hear that there would be more Spider-Man, but was also concerned.  My thought was that the first movie was so good that if the second one was a little less in quality, meaning its still a great movie but not as good as the first, that people will be disappointed and say that the movie sucks.  Well after seeing the movie, I don't have to worry about that anymore.<p>The story continues two years from where the first one stopped.  Peter Parker is trying to balance school, work and a personal life, along with being Spider-Man.  He is always tired, not doing well in school, never able to fulfill committments and still chasing after Mary Jane, who is now a success stage actress.  Peter is doing a paper on Professor Otto Octavious and his new science experiment.  But when his experiment goes wrong, Octavious' wife gets killed and he is now controlled by the robotic arms that he attached to his body in order to do the experiment.  The robotic arms make him evil and convince him that he needs to rebuild his project that has the capability to destroy haf of New York.  So he goes on a crime streak to get some money, hence becoming enemies with Spider-Man.  Peter Parker is becoming frustrated with his crime fighting life, especially after he finds out MJ is engaged.  He decides that he doesn't want to be Spider-Man anymore and soon enough realizes that can't escape his destiny.  Thats enough story without giving too much away.<p>The main players from the first movie are back in this one.  Tobey Maguire gives an amazing performance is this installment, a better performance than the first.  Thank God that he was able to make this movie.  Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and Rosemarry Harris also return for this movie.  The new memeber Alfred Molina plays Doc Ock and does a pretty good job.  I don't think he gave as good of a performance as Willem DaFoe did, but still an excellent job.  The most important person that came back for the sequel was Sam Raimi.  Most movies that have continuing storylines get bad if they lose the director, i.e. Batman without Tim Burton.  The direction of this movie, along with the first one, are what make the movies great.<p>As for the movie, this one has a more indepth storyline.  There is a lot of human emotion involved in the storyline.  I like the bad guy, Doc Ock.  He was my favorite bad guy in the comic books and the effects that were used and his creation to the big screen was awesome.  The action scenes were better in this movie and the special effects were a lot better.  My only grievence with the movie is that it moved slower than the first.  Too many long Aunt May scenes that really slowed down the pace of the movie.  Otherwise this movie is excellent.  Is it better than the first?  I would say that it has some better parts, but also some worse parts.  Its really too hard to choose which one is better.  I guess you'll have to go watch the movie, which I highly recommend that you do, to decide for yourself.</p></body></html>

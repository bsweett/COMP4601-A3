<meta name="summary" content="This movie looks horrible"></head><body><p>I'm a lifelong Batman fan and let me say this movie makes me mad. It's not even close to be accurate by any means to the DC comic book character. The trailers for this movie have looked horrible.<p>In the comic book Salena Kyle is a depressed secretary. She hates herself and has no confidence. She ends up striking back at the people who hurt her and calls herself Catwoman because she loves cats. She has her cat Isces and thats the only friend she has had. She has no special powers.<p>The trailers from the movie make this look like a completely different character. Halle Berry has the lead role as Catwoman. This is a miscast. She's not white and blonde. Wild Wild West has shown that you can't change a major characters race and have it work no matter how popular the actor or actress is. In the trailers I've seen and promos I've read Paitience(they couldn't even keep her real name) in the movie gets involved in a conspiracy in the cosmetic company she works for. After a freak accident she is turned into a catwoman. She has the instincts, strength, and agility of a cat. She then stars using her newfound powers to commit crime which could cost her relationship with detective Tom Lone(Benjamin Bratt).<p>The trailers remind me of Daredevil in the way that Catwoman uses her senses which is stupid. The outfits that Catwoman wear in the movie look stupid as well. (...) .<p>This movie just looks like it belongs in the litter box. It's not accurate at all and it looks bad. They are going to run it into the ground with advertising and it's going to fail. This moive really does remind me of Wild Wild West in that it's going to make some money, but in the end we are all going to wonder why we wasted our time with it.</p></body></html>

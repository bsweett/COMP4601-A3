<meta name="summary" content="Idi Amin"></head><body><p>I thought this was a pretty good movie. I like the concept of seeing Amin's regime thru the eyes of an outsider. I have seen a very good documentary and also a very old OOP movie about Amin that were also very good. I thought Forrest Whitaker was ok as Amin but I don't give him the rave reviews that some others have. This is a good movie though no doubt and I recommend it to anybody though it is a bit gruesome and has some pretty extreme violence.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="&quot;It was just pillow talk baby..&quot;"></head><body><p>Let's set one thing straight right off the bat, there are quite a few editions of Army of Darkness avaiable on DVD, and in my previous review of the film I stated that the original edition of the film, not the director's cut or bootleg edition, was the one to own.  I still stand by that statement, but this new edition (which feels like the umpteenth edition of the film) is the one to own if you don't already have any other edition of the film.  You get two discs, one being the original U.S. Theatrical Cut which features all of Ash's great one liners (&quot;good, bad, I'm the one with the gun&quot;) and the S-Mart ending.  The second disc is the bootleg director's cut with the post apocalyptic alternate ending and the whacky commentary from Bruce Campbell, and Sam and Ivan Raimi.  All in all, if you own any other edition of Army of Darkness on DVD, then you might feel a bit cheated if you buy this, but if you don't own any other edition, pick this up; it's a great deal.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World"></head><body><p>Based on Patrick O'Brian's renowned seafaring adventure novels, Peter Weir's "Master" delivers an intimate, seemingly accurate portrayal of rugged life on the high seas, limited in creature comforts but rich in camaraderie. You can practically smell the salt air and taste the rum. Crowe makes a commanding but compassionate hero, and his friendship with ship doctor and scientist Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), who'd like Aubrey to slow down so he can collect samples of unknown species, provides some interesting character by-play between the full-bore battle sequences. In all, a flavorful, bracing adventure, suitable for family viewing.</p></body></html>

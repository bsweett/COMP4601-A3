It has a bit of everything which can be a recipe for disaster but, in this case, it all comes together to work a miracle.<br /><br />It is not your regular war movie. It takes place at the opening of World War II and involves themes and current events from that war but the war is not the star. It is merely the reason that these people find themselves together in the North African town of Casablanca.<br /><br />It is not an action movie although there are a few shootouts, chases and the like. They are a needed part of the story. When the Nazis or their agents come to get you, you run and they shoot.<br /><br />It is not a comedy although some of the greatest comic lines in all of cinema are found in this gem. "Round up the usual suspects!"<br /><br />It is not a musical although the music is an integral part of the film. It plays a minor but important part. "As Time Goes By" was a decade old when this film came out and was never a hit until this film. Now you cannot help but think of this film without thinking of that song.<br /><br />It is not a love story in the traditional sense. There is a romantic story. Two men love the same woman. She loves them both. The ending is a bit of a surprise and you want to cry for the loser all the while understanding why he gave her up.<br /><br />This film is all of these things and none of them. It merely is.<br /><br />It takes place in the North African town of Casablanca which has been flooded by refuges from the German onslaught. Bogart plays Rick, the owner of a saloon who does very well for himself. The town is controlled by Vichy French and the prefect of police is a lovable cad played by Claude Raines. Two refugees, one an escapee from a concentration camp, come to Rick's trying to procure an exit visa that will allow them to escape to safety. The Nazis don't want them to have it. One of the refugees is Ilse, played beautifully by Ingrid Bergman. She was Rick's lover in Paris until that city fell to the Germans. They were going to go away together and then she disappeared, only to turn up married to the other refugee, a famous critic of the Nazis, Tensions are high all around emotions are running even stronger. Someone has to lose.<br /><br />This DVD edition has plenty of special features for fans. There are some outtakes and deleted scenes from the original movie and plenty of interviews as well as commentaries. Don't buy it for these, however. By it for the glory that is CASABLANCA.</p></body></html>

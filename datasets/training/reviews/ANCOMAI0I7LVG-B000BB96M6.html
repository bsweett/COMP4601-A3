<meta name="summary" content="Ultra rich, yet bitter-sweet; this reimagined take on a classic falls short in some areas yet soars in others..."></head><body><p>I am a huge fan of the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder, so I was skeptical about this 2005 remake.  While Burton's film doesn't match the brilliance of Stuart's classic it does have its moments and there are many redeeming qualities.  It does differ drastically from the `71 film, which is probably a good thing in that it can't find itself chastised too much for failing to live up, for in the end it views like a completely different movie.  Both films were based on Roald Dahl's book, although it was made clear that Dahl disapproved of the `71 film.<br /><br />The basis or foundation of this film is the same as the previous.  A young poor boy finds a golden ticket that gives him the chance to tour the Chocolate Factory of one Willy Wonka.  He's accompanied by his grandfather as well as four other children and their parents, all of which have some very undesirable personality traits.  Their `flaws' so-to-speak end up costing them a great deal in the long run as they make their way through the wacky and crazy factory.<br /><br />`Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is considerably lighter fare than `Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. This has a lot to do with the difference in approach that both Depp and Wilder took to the character of Willy Wonka.  Depp is much more comical and slapstick than Wilder was.  I much prefer Wilder's performance for he added layers of darkness and I think in the end it was his performance that elevated the true morale that this story sets out to embrace.  Depp, looking scarily like Michael Jackson (don't even begin to try and say that he wasn't an inspiration), is hilarious and he proves yet again he is a true chameleon, but I just don't think that his performance is as iconic as Wilder's.<br /><br />What was a nice improvement were the performances given by the child actors here.  All five of them really shine.  We all know that young Freddie Highmore can act; just watch his marvelous performance in `Finding Neverland' (can you say OSCAR SNUB).  Here he is charming and sweet.  AnnaSophia Robb, dubbed the next Dakota Fanning, delivers a very strong performance that sets her apart as `best in show' in my opinion as far as the child actors go.  Julia Winter is also on point and convincing.  Jordan Fry is supremely obnoxious, truly commanding and while Philip Wiegratz isn't really given much to work with, he works well with it.  The parts of the parents are also played well.  Missi Pyle (hilarious), James Fox, Adam Godley and Franziska Troegner are all decent here.  David Kelly is good as Grandpa Joe, although I just loved Jack Albertson's performance.  I wish that Helena Bonham Carter would have had a heftier role, but just looking at her is enough for me sometimes.<br /><br />What can't be denied is the fact that Tim Burton's imagination is boundless.  Visually `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is flawless.  Everything is lush and rich.  That is the biggest draw to this remake; it is a visual masterpiece.  The sets, the costumes, the candy; it is all marvelously created and embellished.  It reminds me in parts of what `Alice in Wonderland' would look like brought to the big screen once again (let's pitch that idea to Tim Burton...with maybe AnnaSophia Robb as Alice...).<br /><br />The biggest drawback to `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' though is the horrendous new songs and musical numbers.  What I found so irritating is the fact that you can't understand a single word Deep Roy is uttering.  I loved the original songs.  I was depressed they had changed them.  They were messy and sloppy and horrendous.<br /><br />In the end I think that `Charlie and Chocolate Factory' may delight more children then the original film did.  This is much lighter and more campy that the Stuart masterpiece.  While Stuart's vision I feel was much more mature and controversial and in the end elicits much more conversation I feel that Burton and Depp understood their audience here and created an above-average family film that is delightful to say the least.</p></body></html>

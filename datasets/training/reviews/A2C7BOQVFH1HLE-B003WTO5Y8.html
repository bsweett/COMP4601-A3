<meta name="summary" content="Some Films Should Only Be Seen In the Cinema!"></head><body><p>That's the thing about whodunnits; once you find out who diddit, the film suffers the next time you watch it.  I do remember though when I first saw this film in the cinema that I was very much involved in it and watching it on the big screen in near total darkness made you feel like YOU were Clarisse and the final scene in the basement stayed with me for a long time after that day too.  It was certainly one of the finest films I had ever seen on the big screen.<br /><br />Now that I'm viewing this once again but on DVD, I can't help but feel that a lot is lost in viewing this film this way.  It made me realise that perhaps a Demme Director's cut version should be released which incorporates the deleted scenes which I thought were pretty good and that would help aid the story along as well.  The sound quality of this Fullscreen version is advertised as 5.1 Surround and is pretty good sound quality wise although the picture quality does look as if it could be improved upon and here's hoping a proper Blu-ray or standard format 20th anniversary edition will be released in a couple of years time in a director's cut version so as to add some freshness and life to this great film.  An anamorphic widescreen version would also be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />As it is though, this film is still very, very good but it doesn't reward repeated viewing for me in its current form.  Here's hoping and waiting for a 20th anniversary directors cut version!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The modern gunrunner"></head><body><p>"Lord of War" opens with the creation of a bullet. It's molded, packed, shipped, plucked out of a bucket, loaded and fired into a child's head.<br /><br />Writer/director Andrew Niccol's film blunt like that, and clever. It darkens world events we thought blessed. Americans celebrated the end of the Cold War. So did freelance gun dealer Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage). The fall of Communism left bunkers of weapons and war vehicles without an army to use them. Yuri, a Brooklyn son of Russian immigrants, swoops into the Ukraine, cleans out the stockpile, and moves the "merchandise" to third-world dictators. The mass genocides that have rages through both of our Gulf Wars - in Africa, Bosnia, Southeast Asia - partially owe their existence to peace between two superpowers.<br /><br />Yuri owes his fortune, his New York penthouse, his trophy wife Ava (Bridgit Moynihan), his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) and his soul to it. Starting with Yuri's first Brooklyn gun deal in 1984 and progressing through the viciousness of West Africa that rages still, "Lord of War" traces his descent into the amoral, reckless, killing coward he becomes by movie's end. It's not necessarily a tragedy - Yuri's a willing crook, part nihilist, part purposeful ignoramus - but a sober essay on gluttony as a way of life, fueled by international apathy. "The ones who know don't care anymore," Yuri says. "And the ones who care won't know."<br /><br />Yuri's lifestyle eventually leads him to the wars of West Africa in the late 1990s, specifically Liberia, run by a goofy fascist named Andre Baptiste (Eamonn Walker) and his son, Andre Jr. who owns a golden gun and drives a Ford Fairlane with two women dressed as Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders in the back. The Andres are Yuri's best clients and his worst temptation: They'll deliver him anything - enemies included - in exchange for guns.<br /><br />"Lord of War" occasionally pauses to consider Yuri's personal life. Vitaly starts as a partner, but his distaste for the work presses him toward self-destruction and addiction. Leto does his wild-eyed thing to some effect. Moynihan had A looks and C skills, serving the role of the bland, pretty Ava well. Unremarkable beyond her looks - and aware of it - she places conscience above comfort to aid her husband's Javert, Interpol cop Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke).<br /><br />Yuri crosses key moral lines in West Africa; fully given over to his sins, we doubt his attempts to go straight when Ava initially confronts him. But the last act falters; it needlessly shoehorns Vitaly back into the business and fashions a cynical, unlikely anti-climax between Yuri and Valentine that seeks to shift the debate from our charming villain to the system that permits his existence. Ever the dutiful liberal film, "Lord of War" tacks on a postscript about the no good, very bad UN Security Council, but I'll better remember the scene where Yuri stumbles around in Liberia to discover two growling hyenas. It's fitting company for him.</p></body></html>

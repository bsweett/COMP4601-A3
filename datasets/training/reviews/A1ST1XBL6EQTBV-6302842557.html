<meta name="summary" content="Classic Film With 20-Minutes Of Restored Footage & Lots Of Great Extras!!"></head><body><p>I'm going to assume that most everybody has seen this now classic film,<br />so I'll spare you a blow by blow of what happens because you already know<br />for the most part that it was based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.<br />This movie recieved 8 Oscars in 1984 (including Best Picture), and the<br />principal actors Tom Hulce (Mozart) and F. Murray Abraham (Salieri)<br />both turned in brilliant performances.<br />This new director's cut replaces 20-minutes of extra footage which was cut<br />from the original theatrical edit, but to be honest, I can't tell you that it<br />really made a difference in the overall story...it was already excellent.<br />But at any rate, there are plenty of great special features on the second disc<br />for fans who like to get really in depth with the behind the scenes of film-making.<br />This product shows just great on my 40" HD 1080p Surround TV and the sound is crisp,<br />as if an orchestra had set up in my den and was playing the musical pieces in real time!<br />I would recommend this as an addition to your DVD collection of great films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A HO HUM THRILLER"></head><body><p>A ho hum thriller that feels very formulaic.  Ford is the head of security for a bank that is about to be robbed by high tech robbers who are holding his family hostage.  See Ford try to get out of this one.  See Ford save his family.  Like I said, it's a bit formulaic and as long as you don't mind it you should be fine watching it.  This movie is a bit dates, too, when everyone was super concerned about identity theft ruining your life so the phase has somewhat passed. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus to B minus; THRILLS & CHILLS: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus; WHEN WATCHED: early May 2011.</p></body></html>

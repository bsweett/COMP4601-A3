This is one of the few movies that when I watch the first 5 mintues of it, I knew that I was gonna love it.  That's how strong this movie allured you.  That's the way movies are supposed to be.<br /><br />Set in NYC, "homely" Andrea is looking for a job.  She is a law student turned journalist.  Somehow, she landed a job interview with Runway, which is THE fashion magazine that makes or breaks fashion and their respective designers.<br /><br />Andrea is out of the fashion league.  She's homely looking.  Her hair is simple.  Her clothes are frumpy and easy to notice that they're not of "top labels".  She's a regular in-shape girl to many of us.  However, to those in fashion, she's FAT!  Overall, she has no clue in the fashion industry.<br /><br />Enters the EIC of Runway, Miranda Priestly, who is like a demigoddess of the fashion world.  She is feared by her staff and designers.  She is seemingly rude, superficial, snobbish and spoiled.  However, she has thick skin and does know her stuff.<br /><br />With sheer luck, Andrea is hired as second assistant to Miranda.  She does all the dirty work such as putting Miranda's coat away, fetching her coffee and many others.  Meanwhile, British first assistant, Emily, is too busy kissing up to Miranda.<br /><br />Gradually, Andrea works her way up as first assistant.  With the help of the magazine's token gay designer, Nigel, Andrea's fashion improves which also gains Miranda's approval.  She is eventually given the coveted trip to Paris for the exclusive runways of the upcoming fashion.<br /><br />While she's moving up the ladder, she loses her soul.  She starts to blow her friends away.  She starts to put her work as priority over her boyfriend.  She starts to lose her goals as a journalist.  She starts to be like Miranda.  Miranda confirms that Andrea is a younger version of herself.<br /><br />The question is will Andrea give up her soul to remain in the fashion world?  Or will she quit the coveted job that "a million girls would kill for"?<br /><br />Meryl Streep is at her best in this film.  You must pay close attention to her eyes.  Her eyes emit strong meanings.  She'll glare, command, approve, reject, dismiss and all that with just her eyes.  She had me laughing at some parts.  Other parts, she had me commenting "oooo, what a b****!"  You either love her or hate her.<br /><br />Overall, I thought that *The Devil Wears Prada* was a wonderful film.  It's a simple film about moving up in a world that is demanding and determining if it is all worth it.  And if it is...at what cost?</p></body></html>

From the very first moment to the very last, this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The movie was intended to mimic the old serials of the 1940's that used to show Saturday mornings at the theaters.  Each episode would end with the hero about to fall off a cliff, get eaten by an aligator, get run over by a train, or some such disaster.  The kids would be sure to come back next week to see what happened and then get left with another cliffhanger.  The only problem with these serials were that they were usually put together on a shoestring.  Generally, only juvenile boys enjoyed them.  However, what if a major film studio backed such a project with a tons of money, a top Hollywood star, a big-name director, and excellent writers.  Well, we'd get "Raiders of the Lost Ark".  (You'll note that the enemy again was the Nazi's; just like in a lot of those old serials).<br /><br />The second movie in the trio, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", was a bit of a disappointment but only because it didn't live up to the original movie.  If someone saw this movie first, "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" next, and finished with "Raiders of the Lost Ark", they'd probably be amazed how everything started out strong and just got better.  There are a number of good scenes in "Temple of Doom" and I guess we can't realistically complain about the supernatural nature of the bad guys; there's plenty of supernatural stuff in the other two movies as well.  However, the source of the supernatural and the nature of the bad guys are generally easier for most of the audience to relate to in Jones I & III.<br /><br />Yes, the Nazis are back in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" and they're just as mean and determined as before.  This time Indiana has his dad along (played by Sean Connery).  They go in search of the Holy Grail and it's amazing what they find.  There are a lot of thrills and spills in this movie as well.<br /><br />I think that there was probably a real wish by the general public to see some more of Indiana Jones after "The Last Crusade" but it hasn't happened and I think Harrison Ford is a bit past his prime to try and recreate the role.  There was a TV program that appeared and, thank goodness, disappeared quickly that portrayed Indiana Jones as a boy.  I don't think George Lucas plans on doing another trilogy ala "Star Wars" but who knows?<br /><br />Those old 1940's serials are mostly lost for good.  The ones that might still be available probably wouldn't be worth the time to watch them. With this set, even your great great grandchildren should be able to enjoy them as much as you did; no matter how old you were when you first saw them.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Please shoot me if I ask to see this movie again..."></head><body><p>Please!  Bill Murray, as Don Johnston in Broken Flowers, has zero personality (but women are attracted to him in the spirit of male fantasy), horrible communication skills (but the women don't mind that he has none), and the most one-dimensional facial expression I've seen since...  Lost in Translation.<br /><br />Don Johnston gets an anonymous note stating that his 19 or so year old son (it's the first time he's heard of it) will be paying him a visit.  In an orchestrated preemptive strike, he visits his list of "usual suspects."<br /><br />After the second visit, you can predict the personality types of the remaining two old girlfriends.  I give you a 95% chance of getting it right.<br /><br />The acting is bad, the dialogue is horrible, the realism is nil...  brrrr.<br /><br />Note that the director also makes it impossible to ever, ever figure out where in the heck Johnston (Murray) is traveling to visit his old flames.  No cities mentioned, no signs in the photos, or distinguishing features in the scenery.<br /><br />The film went from bad to worse.  For all the women out there reading this review, please avoid all men that fit the Don Johnston profile.  You'd be much better off dating the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz.</p></body></html>

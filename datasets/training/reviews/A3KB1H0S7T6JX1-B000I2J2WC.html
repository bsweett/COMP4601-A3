<meta name="summary" content=""Your god does not protect murderers...  He burns them!""></head><body><p>I have to admit that with all the hype surrounding the film I was expecting to see a masterpiece so when it turned out to be "just very good," I was taken aback.<br /><br />Without the hoopla and the unprecedented expectations that had preceded its release it could have easily been a 5 Star movie, but when expecting the entertainment produced by a LOTR type film anything less than perfect is a major disappointment.<br /><br />Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, Alfred Molina and the rest of the amazing cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that can be watched over and over again!<br /><br />The setting, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, while the film does not measure up to Dan Brown's book it is still definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Best Bond Ever Falls Short Of Expectations On DVD"></head><body><p>Connery will always be associated with James Bond and "Goldfinger" will always be considers his best film. Honor Blackman is the ultimate Bond girl, Gert Frobe, the ultimate Bond villian and Bond's Astin Martin, the ultimate vehicle.  Too bad MGM's DVD isn't the ultimate edition.<br />The film's transfer is tired, well worn and loaded with digital imperfections.  Color fidelity is inconsistant and faded. Flesh tones are too orangy.  Often whole scenes contain images that appear out of focus, blurry or with a cloudy haze about the edges. Film grain, excessive digital noise and smeared colors also plague this transfer.  The sound is a disappointing Mono, not even offering the movie's killer title track, sung by Shirley Bassey, in 5.1, as the laserdisc special edition did nearly four years before.  Go figure.  The name may be Bond but the transfer is junk, pure junk.<br />The plus side: MGM's menu page, its jam packed extra features and an intelligent audio commentary are all sparkling additions to compliment this classic spy thriller.  Given all this investment one wonders why the actual print wasn't given more attention.</p></body></html>

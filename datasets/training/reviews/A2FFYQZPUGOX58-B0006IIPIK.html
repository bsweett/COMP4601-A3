<meta name="summary" content="Blurry Movie / Disjointed Script"></head><body><p>The first machines appeared about three years ago.  They were huge frightening things; the only reason you haven't heard of them is because they had restricted their looting to remote regions; that is, until Friday, when the whole world learned of their existence, beginning with New York when squadrons of giant robots flew overhead, landed in the streets, crushing cars as they marched, and tearing up the pavement searching for underground goodies.  The police's firepower was no match for their armored skin; it was time to call in the Sky Captain to save the day. . . .<br /><br />Overall feeling: disappointment.  The designs of the various robots and flying machines are interesting, but the disjointed script and inattention to continuity ruined it.  For example:<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie, a scientist, aboard the Hindenburg III, mysteriously disappears just as the zeppelin ties up to the Empire State Building;  the newspaper covering the story is dated 7 October 1939.<br /><br />Later, when six-story-high mechanical cyclopes, each emblazoned with an emblem of a winged-skull, dig up and steal New York's generators, the newspaper covering this story is dated 17 March 1939.<br /><br />And still later, when Joe and Polly are flying over the Pacific, Joe needs the date so he can look up the location of a star he is using for navigation; Polly tells him the date is 2 March (1939).<br /><br />Apparently, in this alternate universe, time runs backwards. . . .<br /><br />Picture (Blu-ray): 2.5 to 3.  While there are some scenes or parts of a scene that are sharp enough to show significant detail, most scenes are blurry, fuzzy, and nearly colorless with a brown sepia tint; it looks like an old black-and-white movie that has been poorly colorized.  Measured Aspect Ratio as: 1.78:1.  Languages & Subtitles: English, French, and Spanish.</p></body></html>

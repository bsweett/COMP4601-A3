<meta name="summary" content="Well made, bring on the sequel"></head><body><p>X-Men is one of the best comic book adapted movies, it's right up there with both the original Superman and Batman movies. Plus the guy no one ever heard of, Hugh Jackman, gives the breakthrough performance of the year as Wolverine. Anna Paquin, James Marsden, Famke Janssen, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen shine as well. Halle Berry doesn't really work as Storm though; she doesn't have the tough look or right personality for the role. Angela Bassett would have been a better choice, possibly. Plus it would have been cool to see Beast, Gambit and Night Crawler in it, but I understand why they weren't, because who needs an overcrowded cast? The film had enough trouble giving enough screen time for the mutants that were in it as it as it is. Still, with those minor problems out of the way, X-Men is still my number #1 pick for best movie of Summer 2000.</p></body></html>

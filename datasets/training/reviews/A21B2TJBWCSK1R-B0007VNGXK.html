<meta name="summary" content="A brilliant cinematic adaptation of the comic book!"></head><body><p>The success of X-Men and Spider-Man has opened the door for a new wave a comic book adaptations. In the past, studios have played it safe and only green-lighted adaptations of mainstream comic books with large followings. However, this has changed as of late with Ghost World and now with Hellboy. Based on Mike Mignola's comic book of the same name, it has a dedicated cult following at best so it's a pleasant surprise to see a major studio take a big budget gamble with this title.<br /><br />Ron Perlman is perfectly cast as the cigar smoking, two-fisted action hero who eats Baby Ruth candy bars and loves cats. He does a great job of capturing Hellboy's sarcastic, wise-cracking nature. Perlman gets to utter cool one-liners and looks fantastic in his make-up (thanks to legendary make-up artist Rick Baker). Often, what makes it to the movie rarely resembles what was drawn in the comic book. Not the case here-Perlman IS Hellboy. With this role (and hopefully more sequels to come), he is destined to become the cult film icon of the new millennium (much like Bruce Campbell was in the `90s). Perlman has got the drop-dead cool action hero shtick down cold. With his hulking, imposing physique, he's Arnold Schwarzenegger with brains and irony.<br /><br />While the film has the requisite slam-bang action sequences, it is not dominated by them. The film is not driven by them but rather by the characters and the story. And this is because del Toro has strong source material to draw from: Mignola's comic book, in particular "Seed of Destruction," which chronicles Hellboy's origins. Both del Toro and Mignola's works are steeped in the gothic and horror genres, in particular the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft. The author's influence is all over this movie as Hellboy trades blows with Cthulhu-inspired creatures that would make ol' Lovecraft proud.<br /><br />Fans of this movie are in for a real treat as the 2-DVD set is jam-packed with extras that will take hours to explore completely. Here are some of the highlights:<br /><br />The first disc features two audio commentaries. The first is by director Guillermo del Toro and Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. They talk about the nitty gritty details of the filmmaking process. Mignola explains the differences and similarities between the film and the comic book. This is a solid, informative track that is essential listening for Hellboy fans.<br /><br />There are three deleted scenes with optional commentary by del Toro. He mentions that two of them will appear on the extended cut DVD coming out later this year but in edited form so this is the only chance to view them in their entirety.<br /><br />The centerpiece of second disc is an exhaustive two-and-half hour documentary that can be watched in various segments or altogether. Del Toro provides a great description for Hellboy: "Imagine if The X-Files was investigated by an X-File." This is a detailed look at the making of the movie from the graphic novel to the movie itself with great attention paid to the make-up and visual effects.<br /><br />As exhaustive and complete as this 2-DVD set is, del Toro has promised an even more in-depth edition coming out later this year. It will feature an extended cut of the movie and new supplements (including a brand new audio commentary by del Toro) that will go even deeper into the filmmaking process (if that's possible!). In a classy move, Columbia even acknowledges this upcoming edition and includes a $5 off coupon with this current 2-DVD set. Studios rarely, if ever, warn consumers of double-dipping and del Toro has been very vocal in the press about it. Nice.</p></body></html>

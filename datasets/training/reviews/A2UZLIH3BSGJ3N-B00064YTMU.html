<meta name="summary" content="A Very Different Tom Cruise"></head><body><p>Every now and then,an actor who typically gets type cast into "very Hollywood" formulaic films engineered basically just for that actor takes a dive off the deep end.Well,the worm has certainly turned in this one,and I was pleasently surprise by this film.Tom Cruise who typically is "the maveric" character who battles predictable demons in many of his action based films takes on a very interesting character.<br /><br /> On the outside he is easy to decipher...he's an assasin/hitman plain and simple,and you can see how much Cruise enjoyed playing such a different character as opposed to the dull ones he normally gets suckered into.He is a real bad guy in this film.He's intelligent,intriguing,entertaining,but don't forget cold,calculating,precise&he will snuff you out before you can blink,or have a sigh of relief.No changes of heart,no straying from the path,and he takes Jamie Fox along for the ride.<br /><br /> I thoroughly enjoyed his enlighting conversations with jamie Fox&outlook on life as he precieves it&puts into perspective to people who are on auto pilot.I don't want to give up really anything about this movie,as it really is one of Cruise's best thus far.It just goes to show that he is an individual that takes his acting seriously,and will go all out for the right script/part.Not many actors will take a risk...too few do it.As soon as they get their Oscar nomination,they just go for the paycheck and do S*&$!?*^@!ty films afterward.Cruise hits a good one now and then,and I think he's due for an Oscar...it's about bloody time.</p></body></html>

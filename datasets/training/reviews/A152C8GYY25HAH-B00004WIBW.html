<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton in top form"></head><body><p>Tim Burton's latest effort, Sleepy Hollow, is a delight with one exception. We'll get to the exception later, because it's just a judgment call of his that I disagree with. He is one of my favorite directors, and here are some of his most wonderful creations: PeeWee's Big Adventure, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Batman and Batman Returns. Now add Sleepy Hollow to that list.<p>What makes Burton a great director is his style, which is unique to him. His is a childlike point of view, a dreamlike approach in which reality is hardly a consideration. His visions tend to balance delicately somewhere between dreams and nightmares - too humorous to be bad dreams, yet too full of dark images to be good ones. The upstate New York village of Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a quaint and almost inviting one. Still, the sun never shines, and the countryside is anything but inviting. <p>Into this world comes Ichabad Crane [Johnny Depp], a police detective from New York who believes in the scientific approach to solving mysteries. When he is sent to the village to investigate a series of gristly murders, in which the victims are found literally headless, he makes a list of people who might have motive. He scoffs at the villagers' claims that the killer is a Headless Horseman returned from the grave. Unraveling these crimes will also unravel Crane's nerves, as well as his belief in everything's having a rational explanation. <p>Depp, the great physical actor of our times, leads a cast of wonderful performers. Every role is memorable, especially his and Miranda Richardson's. Depp conveys more with his body language than he does with dialog, and he has been a favorite of mine for years. He he can make even a bad movie watchable, and he can make a good one great. You are probably less familiar with Richardson, an English actress who can portray virtually any character.<p>As in any Burton movie, the sets are fascinating. Everything is just a bit out of kilter and exaggerated. Even mundane items have a slightly spooky quality to them. These visual tricks serve the function of drawing the viewer into the movie. They become part of the story.<p>Now, about that judgment call. Sleepy Hollow is filled with enough many violent images to earn it an R rating. I wish they had been toned down. Had Burton chosen to do this, it would have allowed the movie to go out with no more than a PG-13 rating. This would have opened this otherwise delightful period piece to a broader audience. As it is now, I cannot recommend it for younger viewers. I am not, by the way, getting into the fray concerning the general level of violence in entertainment. My remarks are intended to be about this one particular picture.</p></body></html>

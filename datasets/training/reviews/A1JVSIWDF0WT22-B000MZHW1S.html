<meta name="summary" content="NOT BAD ACTION MOVIE BUT.........."></head><body><p>OK movie loses credibility by having every african character speak english and having hundreds of bullets evading the heroes, even when everbody else around them gets hit.<br />Hard to believe Oscar voters nominated DeCaprio in this film over his performance on "The Departed". Doesn't make much sense that him and Hounsou would both get nominated here when they spend 90% of the movie screaming at each other's faces from exactly one inch apart.<br />Not the worst action movie but unfortunately, by having watched it the very next day after "Last king of Scotland", it's Hollywood nature felt all the more obvious to me.</p></body></html>

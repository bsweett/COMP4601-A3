ToothFairy is a lot more sinister in this version (thanks to the extraordinary Ralph Fiennes, can't wait to see him as Voldmort).  Anthony Hopkins could play Hannibal Lector in his sleep.  Strong performance by both Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Emily Watson.  Thought Edward Norton gave a very lack luster performance, nothing like his in American History X or Primal Fear, so he was the weak link.  Very erie feel to the movie. Has one or two rough spots but all in all I would diffently recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

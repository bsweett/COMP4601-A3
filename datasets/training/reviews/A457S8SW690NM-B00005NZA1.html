Period.<br /><br />The first time I saw this movie was a couple of years ago right after watching the sixth sense. The sixth sense was good with a shocker of an ending but was overated. Now comes Unbreakable, a movie in a so called trilogy, but this obviously got cancelled once everyone hated it. Well, I can't agree with that. And, I can't sit back while this movie gets criticized. Give me 0 out of 567777777 helpful votes, I don't care. I need to get my point across.<br /><br />First of all, PG-13 movies are horrible. End of story. The only good ones are the comedies. SOMETIMES ONLY THOUGH. After that, well, it's crap. The action movies are horrible with nonstop explosions and horrible acting. Simply put, well, if you look in my top 50 movies of all time (which I find to be veryaccurate), there are probably ZERO PG-13 movies. Only R. Why? Because R movies are realistic, and it's there that I can find the powerful dramas and the eye popping action movies. But wait what's this? Unbreakable, a PG-13 movie in my top 50? Scary. But true. I am very dissapointed that this movie didn't fare well because it gives all. It is a powerful movie, with excellent acting, and a fantastic ending. The plot is remarquable and finally something original. I found the movie to be very well made, with wonderful directing and writing. The actors are all connected and are great together. As for the plot, wow, it's amazing. The movie is about a man played by Bruce Willis that survives a horrific train crash. Without any injury. Without a scratch. Meet Elijah played by the always wonderful Samuel L. Jackson who does as usual an excellent job. He is very breakable, with a very serious problem that makes him very vulnerable to injuries. He is an avid comic book collector and when he hears of the crash and one survivor, he knows that he is a superhero. Like in his comic books. Of course he is crazy. Right?<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic and has great chemistry with Bruce Willis. The movie has a very unpredictable ending (oh I'm sorry that I'm not as smart as the one reviewer who had it predicted in the first 5 minutes. ? He didn't even have the wreck in the first 5 minutes! We didn't even meet Elijah yet! And you want action, right? This isn't an action movie!)<br /><br />The movie had a very good moral and had a deeper meaning I found to be very intersting.<br /><br />This trully is a wonderful and compelling movie that I adore. And for a movie fan like me, this is just what I've been looking for.</p></body></html>

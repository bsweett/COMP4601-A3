<meta name="summary" content="A Truly Great Film!"></head><body><p>"The Last King of Scotland" is a truly great film.  It entrances the viewer with its mixture of horror, crowd magnetism and spine tingling drama.  I can recommend this film unreservedly.<br /><br />It would be a particularly unworldly or uninformed person who was not at least broadly familiar with Idi Amin.  His role as the dictatorial president of Uganda in the 1970s was unfortunately typical of corruption in African politics.  He presided over the systematic slaughter of 300,000 of his fellow citizens whilst simultaneously destroying its economy.  It was Winston Churchill who referred to Uganda as "the pearl of Africa".  It was Idi Amin who debauched it.<br /><br />Forest Whitaker plays the role of Idi Amin.  He is absolutely spell binding and, hopefully, will receive a best actor Oscar for his efforts.  Whitaker shows the brutal and lethal mix that was typical of Amin.  He would be a combination of ignorance, great charm and ruthless tyrant with scarcely a breath between each.<br /><br />"The Last King of Scotland" is based on the book of the same name by Giles Foden.  It covers the sometimes morally ambivalent behaviour of a young Scottish doctor (Nicholas Garrigan played by James McAvoy) who travels to Uganda to "make a difference".  Unfortunately, the young doctor easily falls under the spell of Amin and becomes his personal physician.  Through a series of unquestionably dubious decisions, he is drawn further into the maelstrom of Ugandan politics.  The story becomes increasingly chilling and has an ending of mixed emotions.<br /><br />I would encourage all readers of this document to see this film.  You will not be disappointed.  Whitaker's work has to be seen to be believed.</p></body></html>

This is probably Fincher's best film, his movies lately haven't been that good (Zodiac and Panic Room). Brad Pitt is nice eye candy but this guy is the real deal, he is a fabulous actor and this thriller proved it. Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow also star, both are really good as well. Kevin Spacey is flawless as a serial killer who toys with Pitt's character right up 'til the very end. I highly recommend this psychological thriller, enjoy!</p></body></html>

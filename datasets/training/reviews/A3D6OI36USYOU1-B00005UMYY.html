Shuffle pages, go to Kinkos, make 300 copies, shuffle again, call Tarantino. Rake in the dough.<p>I give this film credit for trying to be different, but the only thing it succeeds in doing is being a monotonous bore. The votes for this dog are proof positive of the near complete dumbing down of this country...either that or just another example of the "Bandwagon" Syndrome.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Story first...then the eye candy"></head><body><p>There just did not seem to be an intriguing story behind all this. It's noisy and flashy and moves fast, but I never got emotionally involved. The two jiving robots were embarrassing and degrading, and I'm a white guy. Two dogs humping, and a robot humping Fox's leg...now that's what I call entertainment. The first Transformers had a story and was enjoyable. This one just assumed we cared about the characters, I think we needed a few scenes to get us re-involved with them. Then we would have been experiencing all the action vicariously thru them...not just watching in a detached way.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Boring Express"></head><body><p>A milestone in cinema computer animation production. However, with all the technology, the bottom line of any film is an interesting and original storyline.  THE POLAR EXPRESS is wrought with predictability and dullness.  The audience knows the train is headed for the north pole to end up at Santa's villiage and work shop. The audience knows the main character is going to hop on the train, meet up with a bunch of precocious children (Eddie Deezen's --1941, GREASE, I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND-- annoying voice is the most recognizable of the bunch)and other uninteresting characters (i.e. the train conductor, the hobo etc). The audience knows that somehow the main child character will end up meeting Santa Clause and change his disbelief. Lastly, the plot device of whether this is a dream or reality is a tired cliche done in movies from THE WIZARD OF OZ to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. To get back to the technology and animation technique, it takes its look from a children's story book by Chris Van Allsburg. Then the actor's motion and facial expressions are transcribed into a computer program and given the cgi treatment etc. However, it looks haunting, dark, and creepy especially once the Polar Express reaches Santa's village and the townspeople and elves appear.  It looks like a bunch of people being sent off to concentration camps. Overall...Overrated!! Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis have a pretty good track record of great films, but this is a vanity project that falls short of its promise.</p></body></html>

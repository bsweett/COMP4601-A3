<meta name="summary" content="U.S. Marshall played by Leonardo DiCaprio faces a surreal and enigmatic dreamscape"></head><body><p>Leonardo DiCaprio plays a U.S. Marshall called on to investigate the escape and disappearance of a patient from the Civil War island fortress which serves as an institute for the treatment of the criminally insane.  Set in the gray cold war year of 1954, DiCaprio's Marshall finds himself immediately enmeshed in a Kafkaesque maze presided over by the aloof chief psychiatrist played by Ben Kingsley.  As if being trapped on an island insane asylum accessible only by ferry in the midst of a terrible storm is not enough to face, the Marshall is also plagued by his own personal demons.  His dreams are marked by the beseeching eyes and voices of the dead, from his late wife (played hauntingly by Michelle Williams) to the inhabitants of the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau that he had encountered as an American soldier at the end of World War II.  The troubled and numerous dreams of the protagonist cause the audience to wonder which events correspond to reality and which exist only in his own mind--to the point where the movie becomes something other than a classic thriller.  The viewer is less inclined to sit on the edge of his seat if that which the protagonist encounters may be only his own dark thoughts.</p></body></html>

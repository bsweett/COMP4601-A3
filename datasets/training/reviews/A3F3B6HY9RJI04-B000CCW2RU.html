This is basically Logan's Run with 21st century special effects.<br /><br />I was warned by a lot of people to avoid this movie.  But I figured I'd give it a shot on a rental.  And I'm really glad I did as I found this to be a great science fiction find.  If you like technology driven science fiction then this movie is most definitely for you.<br /><br />The acting is great, particularly from Ewan McGregor who gets to play two roles in this movie.  The story has some holes and questions left open but I actually found it to cover the bases better than most other sci-fi movies.  If you are into explosions, then this movie will most definitely supply what you are looking for.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is the story and plot.  It does a wonderful job of creating a futuristic "world" that is both new and yet still familiar.  The story deals with a topic that is under much debate, which is cloning.  While this will in no way convince anybody one way or another (except the extremely gullible), it is still interesting to look at cloning as presented by this movie.<br /><br />My only disappointment in this movie was a completely unnecessary love scene between Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannson.  Unnecessary because it didn't add to the story, but even worst, it was contradictory to what we knew about the characters.  It served as nothing more than a distraction from the movie.</p></body></html>

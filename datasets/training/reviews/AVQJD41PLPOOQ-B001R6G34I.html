<meta name="summary" content="The most technologically-significant motion picture of all time!"></head><body><p>Let us all just forget, for a moment, all that we've come to know about mechanical sharks, blue screens and CGI, and go back in time to the year 1932, when KING KONG was being made.<br /><br />Talking pictures were only five years-old.  KING KONG was about to introduce hardcore action combined with snappy dialogue and a spectacular musical soundtrack by Max Steiner.  In 1925, the silent film, THE LOST WORLD, had given audiences one of its first glimpses into the world of stop-and-go motion in the world of dinosaurs.  In April of 1933, the world was blown away by a giant ape and his all-out assault on humanity and the great city of New York.  Try to imagine audiences sitting in Radio City Music Hall in complete awe, asking themselves, "How on earth did they do that???"<br /><br />Movie-making techniques shall continue to advance as long as the motion picture industry exists.  And lo, let us never forget it's most momentous and significant origin...with the eighth wonder of the world!<br /><br />Peter Jackson has said that after he saw KING KONG as a child, he knew he wanted to make movies.  Who can blame him?</p></body></html>

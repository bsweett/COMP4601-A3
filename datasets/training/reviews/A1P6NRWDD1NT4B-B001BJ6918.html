<meta name="summary" content="Tarantino Does it Again"></head><body><p>A minority of detractors have complained that KILL BILL-Vol 2 (and Vol. 1) is derivative.  However, this is Quentin Tarantino and there is a certain stamp and style to this film (and all his films). What is homage is also adding a large amount of originality to a genre.  Both volumes of KILL BILL is an amalgam of spaghetti westerns, kung fu movies,anime, and revenge flicks. The standout performance is, of course, Uma Thurman (as 'The Bride'). She is bent on revenge and wanting payback from those who "ruined" her wedding day and out to kill the man who engineered "the hit" on her: Bill (good to see David Carradine in a major movie role). This was a unique performance for Thurman showing off her acting and physical chops, and she should get a Best Actress nomination. Once again Tarantino shows his flair for crisp dialogue, drawn out scenes, and his love of pop culture, television and movies in general. When Uma Thurman as 'The Bride' gets in her 'revenge-and-kill' mode and the theme song from the tv series IRONSIDE (Raymond Burr) blares in the background, it's pure joy. It's ashame Tarantino doesn't do more movies.  However, as one film reviewer in praise of Tarantino's work states (to paraphrase), one has to remember that Tarantino is also a writer as well as a filmmaker.  He writes the films he directs. Therefore, it is a long process between film projects.  It might be a blessing because it makes his films worth waiting for. This reviewer is looking forward to Tarantino's next project.</p></body></html>

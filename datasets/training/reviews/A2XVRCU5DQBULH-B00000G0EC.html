<meta name="summary" content="A special-effects classic..."></head><body><p>This is one of my all-time favorite films. Let me just lay that out. This one rules. Hopefully, you've seen it by now and if you haven't you must. This techno-savvy thriller from Steven Speilberg doesn't follow its source novel to the letter, but it's just as fun to watch this movie as it is to read the (very good) book. It's about a theme park gone horribly wrong. The test tourists exploring the dinosaur park soon become dino fodder for the main attractions. This is an immensely fun movie, and is just as deserving to be called a classic as Speilberg's &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;E.T.&quot; The special effects are still incredible. That scene with the brontosaurus still sends chills down my back. It looks so real! There are plenty of mistakes in this movie, but they're mostly continuity stuff or little things. All the important stuff they got right. Speilberg is a master behind the camera, and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; proves why. This is a must-see.</p></body></html>

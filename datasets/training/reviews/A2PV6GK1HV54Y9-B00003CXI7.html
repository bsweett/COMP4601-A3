I like this movie, Pfeiffer steals every scene while Ford plays his creepiest role yet. What Lies Beneath is about a husband and wife who are now in the empty nest period of their lives, the daughter has moved onto college and the couple have buried a secret and finally starts resurface. This film is a bit slow especially the first hour but after that the pace and story fall into place. Give this sly and slick ghost film a chance. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

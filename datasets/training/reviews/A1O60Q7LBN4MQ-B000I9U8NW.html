<meta name="summary" content="It could have been better"></head><body><p>I wonder how can a movie with The Shield star Michael Chiklis and Nip/Tuck star Julian McMahon be so dull. The Fantastic Four was my favorite superhero comic book when I was a kid. In fact, it was the only one I would buy. Like most girls, I preferred the Archie books. There was one fun scene where The Thing tries to help someone who was going to commit suicide. All the superheros joined in to help and the world got to see their superpowers. But in general, it was unexciting. It should have been so much better.</p></body></html>

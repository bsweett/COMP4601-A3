<meta name="summary" content="Forest Whitaker-The King of Acting"></head><body><p>This is one of my favourite performances by a male actor in film history.  Forest Whitaker is something else.  He just totally embodied his character, and he gets so into his craft.  He's one of the few actors left with total passion and heart.  My favourite scene is when they are at the airport and Forest Whitaker finds out his assistant/doctor is trying to poison him, and had an affair with one of his wives.  When he gets in his face and breaks it down to him, it was a classic cinematic moment and brilliant acting.  I also love the way "Last King of Scotland" was filmed.  All the technical aspects were overlooked by Forest Whitaker's oscar performance.  They really made it look like the 70,s.  The whole film had that 70's feel.  There is also some great music in the movie too.</p></body></html>

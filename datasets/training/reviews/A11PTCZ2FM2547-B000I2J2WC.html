<meta name="summary" content="Well, I'll Be A Knight's Templar"></head><body><p>I admit it.  I'm one of the few. . .the proud. . .the brave. . .who has not read Dan Brown's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400079179">The Da Vinci Code</a>.  I generally eschew pop culture, which this book most certainly is, yet when I caught the film version of THE DA VINCI CODE on cable recently, I immediately was entertained.  I knew bits and pieces of the story--the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar, the Apocrypha, a Vatican cover-up--so it didn't take much (a disturbing, very bizarre murder/mutilation) to get me hooked as this fast-paced thriller took off.<br /><br />So because I had not read the book, I had no preconceived notions of main character Robert Langdon; accordingly, Tom Hanks was just fine--although his hair was kind of. . .odd.  Hanks plays very well off the delightful Audrey Tautou, who in turn possesses a most euphonious accent (and is easy on the eye).  Following the murder both Hanks and Tautou embark on a breathless journey through France and England--pursued by the police and a self-flagellating albino monk--in search of an artifact that, if found, could scandalize Christianity to its very ecclesiastical core.  They are joined in the chase by an ornery Ian McKellen playing a colleague of Hanks and a self-proclaimed Holy Grail expert.<br /><br />Through all the twists and turns this film reaches its inevitable over-the-top ending, yet it's all good religious fun.  And through the viewing experience I learned about symbology, cryptology, the Priory, Da Vinci's 'The Last Supper', and a well-traveled sarcophagus--all without reading the book, mind you.  Plus director Ron Howard has yet to make a dog; his THE DA VINCI CODE is certainly no exception to this noteworthy trend.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

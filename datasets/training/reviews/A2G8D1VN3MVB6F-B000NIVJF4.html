Aside from that fact, it was a good way to spend a few hours. The acting was first rate as Whitaker was very convincing as a crazy maniacal madman who cannot admit the reality that surrounds his world. To Amin, the outside world is something to be denied in the pursuit of his own interests and dreams. When the outside hinder s his goals, Amin's answer is to kill those who would acknowledged the influence the outside upon his interests. The one bit of real fact that the movie catches is the suffering imposed upon the people of Uganda. Amin's terror rested great suffering upon the individuals of Uganda.</p></body></html>

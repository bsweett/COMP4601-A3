I don't know what scenes were re-added, but I'm betting that the one with the mother being committed to the mental ward was there as it completely CONTRADICTS the next scene where the priest's mother is supposed to have died in her apartment and no one questions when they released her from the hospital.<p>Besides that this is a movie that's supposed to be menacing but falls flat. A 12-year old girl swears and pukes. Now I'm not a fifth grade teacher but I don't see what's so scary about that. By the time the wacky Jesuits come a-calling the movies been going on for almost 2 hours and you just want it to end. <p>That's not to say that this movie is worthless. It did inspire a really cool Angel episode. But it's dated. You can almost get out your pen and start writing an essay about working parents worried that their kids are going to turn out to be bums/hippies on a scene-by-scene basis. <p>By the way, I know I am committing horror movie blasphemy here but I really liked the sequel with George C. Scott and Brad Douriff as the demon-possessed priest. That was Exorcist III. It was just great to see Scott and Douriff face off against each other although I don't remember a thing about the plot except it had something to do with the demon-possessed priest and a serial killer and George C. Scott was way scarier than any demon from hell.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Brosnan Gives Bond the Finger"></head><body><p>After MGM dumped him from the stagnant Bond franchise and implicitly questioned his abilities as an actor, Brosnan signed on to The Matador and turned in the performance of his career.<br /><br />Brosnan plays Julian Noble, an unkempt, oft-inebriated, and decidedly unsuave world-class assassin who suffers from panic attacks. In other words - he's the anti-bond. Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis play the ordinary couple who are sucked into Julian's world in this odd mash-up of spy-thriller and buddy comedy, but Brosnan undoubtedly steals the show.<br /><br />His Julian is a vulgar, shiftless villain with an appetite for orgies, underage girls, and conspicuously well-shaken vodka martinis. He is disgusting, pathetic and uninhibited by conscience, a combination that makes his nervous instability all the more unsettling. The fact that Brosnan still manages to make us root for Julian is quite a feat. Critics be silenced - this man can act.<br /><br />The story itself is well executed, if somewhat predictable, but Brosnan easily carries it over the finish on Julian's shoulders. A better than average film featuring a must-see performance by Brosnan.  DVD includes directors commentary and behind the scenes footage.</p></body></html>

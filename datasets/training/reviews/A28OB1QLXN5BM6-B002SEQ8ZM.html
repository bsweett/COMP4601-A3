This dark odyssey starts with a young girl's boredom and ends with her being appreciative of her own backyard. Both figuratively and literally. It is a well-told tale reminiscent of Through the Looking Glass, The Wizard of Oz, and Hansel and Gretel. What I particularly liked about the tale was that CORALINE's parents are alive and remain so from beginning to end. Yeah for living parents!<br /><br />When first we see CORALINE (not Caroline, as she has to remind folks quite often) (voiced by Dakota Fanning), she is bored. She lives in an apartment with her mother and father, both of whom work from home but can't give her the attention she craves. She tries visiting the old Vaudevillian ladies who live upstairs as well as the crazy old man who trains the mice, but she just doesn't understand them. Huh. Then she finds the key and the door, and the passage beyond that's sometimes there and sometimes not. The old man says that the mice have a message for her: don't enter the passage. If only CORALINE had listened.<br /><br />What CORALINE finds beyond that passageway is what makes this story interesting. It's what makes all classic fairytales interesting. Temptation, morality, determination, and heroism, all wrapped up like a spooky burrito with a side order of eerie dipping sauce.<br /><br />CORALINE is a dark movie, full of black magic and creepy critters.  Brilliantly directed by Henry Selick (who brought us THE CORPSE BRIDE, JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH, and THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS) and Michael Cachuela, CORALINE is fast paced and contains just the right amount of spookiness.  My 12 year old LOVED this film, and my 4 year old liked it, too.  She did not have any bad dreams, and she completely understood that it was not real.  The animation is unique and very moody - perfect for this film.  The voice talent is all outstanding, but truly you are more interested in this weird and wonderful story than you are the voices.<br /><br />CORALINE is a MUST SEE movie for 2009 and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by my entire family.  We had a great time watching it together.  CORALINE might not be typical family movie night fare, but it worked for us.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I Know It Sounds Cliche, But.....Fantastic!"></head><body><p>I've seen plenty of comic book flicks, and I'm not just talking about the recent ones like the Spiderman films and the latest "Batman Begins."  I've seen all of the old Christopher Reeve "Superman" flicks, the Adam West "Batman" movies, and even some duds like the Dolph Lundgren version of "The Punisher" and both "Swamp Thing" films.  Hopefully that establishes my credit on reviewing "Fantastic Four" and giving it such a high rating.<br /><br />The story is, much like all comic first films in what will inevitably be at least followed by one sequel, an origin story.  Tim Story(Barbershop) handles the direction quite well.  Much like in "Barbershop," Story develops the background of each character with depth and simplicity at the same time.  His comic-timing, especially with Human Torch and Thing, is perfect.  That duo alone is worth watching together.  I read in an issue of "Starlog" that Story was a little nervous about the special effects in this film because he wasn't used to using them.  He was told not to worry about the effects, that would be handled by Kurt Williams and his team of pros.  That fact comes through in this film, because the characters are developed perfectly and the special effects, while brilliant, honestly take a step back from the story.  This film is perhaps more character driven than any other comic flick out there.  You really get a sense of family between the characters on the screen.<br /><br />All of the actors captured the wonder of each of the heroes(or villain) that they portrayed.  Michael Chiklis might be running around in an orange rock suit for the majority of this film, but you can honestly see how big Thing's heart really is.  He could have smashed anything in his path, but instead, we learn he cares more for others than himself.  His struggle to become Ben Grimm again throughout the film is played out perfectly.  Jessica Alba does a wonderful job as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman.  Much like in the comic, she tries very hard to keep the boys from killing each other, all the while managing to blend into the background.  Thing might be made of rock, but Alba's character is the solid foundation for this group of characters.  Her brother, Johnny Storm/Human Torch, is the wild card in this bunch.  He embraces his newfound fame as a superhero, and reacts probably like any normal human being thrown into the situation would.  He loves his popularity, but he, much like Thing, cares deeply for the others in this family of heroes.  Chris Evans handles the role of Torch with youthful abandon, and it bleeds through the screen.  Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic is portrayed by Ioann Gruffudd.  I don't know much about this guy, other than that he was in the recent "King Arthur."  Other reviewers have said he was too geeky in this role, but guess what folks, Reed Richards is a geek.  Gruffudd has a flawless performance as the leader of the Fantastic Four.  He's goofy, a little bit too enveloped with his work, and even a little unsure of himself at times, but in the end, he really does know the answer to everything.  In other words, Richards is a little bit father-figure, a little bit big brother, and a lot of fun in a geeky, awkward sense of the word.  Julian McMahon plays Dr. Doom, and manages to do it with cold and calculated flair.  Unlike many other bad guys, Doom's voice remains the same before and after he dons his metal mask, which goes to show that this dude was evil even before he became a metal megalomaniac.<br /><br />As stated before, the effects are brilliant.  They enhance the performances of the actors instead of draw your attention away from them.  There is some heavy CGI, but it rarely looks fake.  In fact, only Mr. Fantastic's stretching maneuvers seem to come across a little fake.  Chiklis' bodysuit blends in perfectly with the rest of the effects.  It allows him to show emotion that we weren't able to see in CGI creations like Hulk, and he wasn't fake-looking in his battle sequences like some of the other heroes from the page as of late.<br /><br />Overall, this is actually a very good family film.  There is a little bit of language, but nothing you won't hear at the local Wal-Mart or in the mall.  There is one particularly violent scene involving Dr. Doom and someone who crosses him, but other than that, damage is rather minimal.  There's plenty of comedy, mostly provided by Thing and Human Torch, but Mr. Fantasic's awkwardness is also fun to watch.<br /><br />If you want an excellent, action-packed, comedic, and, most importantly, plot-driven film, "Fantastic Four" is perfect.  It is well deserving of its five stars, and I hope you check it out.</p></body></html>

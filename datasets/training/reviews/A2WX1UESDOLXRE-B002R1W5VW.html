<meta name="summary" content="Fun With A Surprising Twist"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed this movie, up until the end, but a few minutes after the film ended I decided that I really did like the ending. It all works. This movie is so funny and likeable that I don't think many people can turn away from it's endearing charm and wit.<p>Cage stars as Roy, a guy with a serious amount of nervous ticks and obsessive compulsive behaviors. He can never calm down-- it's like he's got caffeine for blood, which makes him a really fun character to be around for the couple hours the movie is. Roy is a con artist, pulling a big job with his partner Mark (Sam Rockwell-- who is absolutely amazing). Mark is annoyed that Roy can't even calm down when they're in the middle of a job so he tells Roy to see a shrink. Roy then learns he has a fourteen year old daughter, played by the magnificnet Allison Lohman. She's emotional, she smells like bubble gum, and she's in the way of Roy's life as a con artist. <p>The ending really is too good for words. It surprised the heck out of me, that's for sure. I never saw it coming. There's certainly a sadness to it, but it works so well I can't hardly complain. <p>Truly, this movie is worth watching. Cage playing a guy with so many ticks is irresistably funny, a tad annoying, and kind of sad all at the same time. This movie not only boasts alot of talent from it's actors, but an endearing story with an unexpected ending. I recommend this one to anyone who just wants to see an awesome movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Original flick - thought it would suck - man was I wrong!"></head><body><p>I skipped seeing this at the theaters - I thought i would be a waste of time.  Then I saw on one of those 5" seat-back screens on a flight to Denver. I was really surprised. The special effects, as expected, were amazing. The background of cap and his character development really added to the plot.  The Red Skull? Again, the movie pulled it off.<br /><br />People that give this movie 1 or 2 stars don't get it.  Some parts are supposed to be cheesy and over the top! Tying in Iron Man's dad and all the little tidbits that are planted throughout the movie also help build the background for th Avengers. Although I still think "Thor" was the worst movie in decades, there's even a major tie-in to Odin.<br /><br />This is a fun romp, does not take itself too seriously, and draws simple lines between good and evil.  The Red Skull is such a baddie, even the SS fears him! Cap is more American than the Man of Steel. Both owe their strength and powers to the same scientist, and even if they are not biologically related, they have a common genesis and "father."<br /><br />This really is a must see for action hero fans!</p></body></html>

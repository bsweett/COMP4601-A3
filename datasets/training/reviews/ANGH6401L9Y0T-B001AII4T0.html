<meta name="summary" content="The Title Fits: A Very Spine-Tingling Story"></head><body><p>Ben Affleck plays Jack Ryan, CIA analyst formerly played by Harrison Ford. Morgan Freeman plays his boss, William Cabot, formerly played by James Earl Jones. Big shoes to fill, but they do a great job.<br /><br />This movie is aptly named. It comes terribly close to all-out nuclear war. The story opens when, during the 1973 Israeli war, the Israeli army launches a single plane carrying a nuclear bomb, "just in case." It is shot down over the desert, and the sand covers the bomb. Twenty-nine years later (i.e., 2002, the date the movie was made), an Arab finds the bomb and sells it to a black market arms dealer, who buys it for $400, claiming it's not worth much. The Arab has no way of knowing it is nuclear, until much later when he is dying of radiation poisoning.<br /><br />In the meantime, Ryan and Cabot make an inspection tour of the Russian nuclear facilities to observe their dis-assembling of weapons pursuant to a treaty. They note that three nuclear scientists are missing, the Russians explain one is out sick, one is on vacation, one recently died in an automobile accident. Not true, discovers the canny CIA, and tries to find the missing scientists.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the arms dealer has sold the bomb, the plutonium was taken out and those three missing scientists built a new bomb with it. Then they were shot by the people they built it for so they could not talk.<br /><br />I won't give any more away, but Ryan is truly brilliant as he discovers what happened to the plutonium, and where it came from. However, he did not track it fast enough to keep it from being used to blow up a football stadium in Baltimore in which the President was a spectator. Fortunately, a warning got through to the president soon enough that he was in Air Force One when the bomb went off. Ryan, however, was in a helicopter. By the way, Ryan's girlfriend is a physician who works in a Baltimore hospital, so all the while he's running around trying to save the world, he doesn't know if she's alive or not.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Return of the Rage."></head><body><p>Taking a play from the George Romero zombie-movie book, 28 WEEKS LATER--the sequel to the 2002 successful zombie picture 28 DAYS LATER directed by Danny Boyle--has none of the original characters from the original picture.  Instead, the film revolves around new characters living in England in the aftermath of death and destruction caused by the Rage virus.<br /><br />The picture begins during the time period of 28 DAYS LATER with a group of unaffected citizens attempting to survive in the English countryside until those infected with the virus die out.  It looks like they will make it until the cottage they are staying in is attacked by a horde of zombies.  A small battle ensues, but the survivals are outnumbered.  Some of the survivors, including Donald Harris (Robert Carlyle) and his wife Alice (Catherine McCormick) try to make it to the escape route, a boat on the river.  Things go terribly wrong and Catherine is attacked and bitten by the creatures.  Thinking only of himself, Donald leaves his wife behind and succeeds in escaping down the river.<br /><br />The movie then fast forwards seven months after the initial outbreak.  The virus was contained and didn't escape the country of England.  Those infected died within a few weeks.  With the help of the United States military, the country is in the very initial stages of rebuilding while scientists attempt to develop an anti-virus should an outbreak of the Rage occur again.  Donald meets his children who had been staying overseas in the U.S. and they attempt to rebuild their lives.  The Harris children soon find themselves feeling like prisoners and unable to understand why they can't return to their old home since the virus is now contained.  They sneak through the safety barrier and return to their old home.  There they discover that their mother is still alive.  It is later discovered that though she has not been affected by the virus, she is carrying it in her blood.  With Mrs. Harris discovery, there is hope that an anti-virus might be developed from her blood.  However, no one suspects how far love and guilt can push a person and London soon finds itself in the middle of another outbreak.<br /><br />As far as sequels go, especially a zombie movie sequel, 28 WEEKS LATER is especially well done.  Starting with the prologue that introduces some of the main characters and ties this film to the events from the original, 28 WEEKS LATER does an excellent job of remaining true to the mood and tone of 28 DAYS LATER, yet, sets up a completely different story that stands strong on its own.  A person doesn't need to see 28 DAYS LATER to be able to enjoy 28 WEEKS LATER.<br /><br />Personally, I was initially reluctant to see 28 WEEKS LATER because it wasn't directed by Danny Boyle (though he did direct some of the second unit filming).  But after hearing positive remarks about the movie from close friends, I'm glad I saw the picture.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who has seen 28 DAYS LATER and people who like zombie movies.</p></body></html>

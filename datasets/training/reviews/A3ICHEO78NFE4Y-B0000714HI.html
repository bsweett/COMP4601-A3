I was glad i wasn't in the audience.  This IS the dumbing down of America at it's best.  It's humor is just plan stupid, the acting is a mockery to the actors guild.  There is no entertainment value except to show the rest of the world what americans think is comedy. No wonder we are hated.  The movie is pointless, doesn't go anywhere, it's stupid and is not very creative. There is no value to this film at all. This film is an insult to real comedy.  It's just white trash at it's very best.</p></body></html>

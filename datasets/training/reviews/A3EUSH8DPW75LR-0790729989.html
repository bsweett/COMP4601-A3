<meta name="summary" content="Amazing film superb on blu ray"></head><body><p>David Fincher is a director who has had an amazing career with his latest highlight being THE SOCIAL NETWORK.  But a film that was praised by the critics but overlooked at the Oscars is one of his very best - SE7EN. It is amazing to believe that it came out in 1995.  It was a ratrity in its time being a true horror film while at the same time being an intense, intelligent deep psychological thriller.  The blu ray is amazing and the film certainly stands the test of time.  The movie is an absorbing, shocking and frightening tale of society, man, sin and the fine line that there is between good and evil and lives on in grand style on this glorious blu ray.  The film is dark and takes place in a city with no name.  Everything is aging, decrepid and depressing.  But the black/white levels on the blu ray are superb and the detail and clarity are amazing throughout.  Colors though subdued are still very realistic and pop naturally as do skin tones.  The crispness of the pictures adds a whole new level of intensity to the film.  And the audio is a mindblower with its 7.1 lossless DTS track.  Dialogue is strong and present and surround speakers are put to excellent use.  The disc also comes packaged in a superb digibook excellently crafted with much info on the film.  There are also tons of extras on the disc.<br /><br />I highly recommend SE7EN.  This is a film that is indeed a classic.  It has standout performances by Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey.  It is also a film that is not gratuitous in its horror.  It serves a purpose and the way it is utilized makes it linger with you that much longer.  This film is so well crafted in every aspect that repeat viewings will be a must.  I remembered the whole story line when I first watched this blu ray and it in no way ruined the experience.  The knowing of things actually added to the trepidation and appreciiation of how superb the film actually is.<br /><br />Luckily I received my blu ray packaged in a cardboard box but I have had the experience many have had here with other films from Amazon where bubble wrap packaging ruined a digibook.  Remember that you can rate the packaging of the shipment in your Amazon account and they do listen.  Also if it is damaged in transit Amazon will let you return it for another.  Don't let them off the hook if it was not packaged properly.  They do provide hassle free returns and stand behind their products 100% covering all return charges.</p></body></html>

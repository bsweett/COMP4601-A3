I admit that I postponed watching it because it runs practically 3 hours and I never seemed to have that much spare time.  When my daughter's friend looked over my video collection, focussed immediately on "Amadeus" to the near exclusion of everything else, and called it his favorite movie of all time, I figured that maybe it's time to take a look.  I'm certainly glad I did.  This is an outstanding movie that should please the history buffs, the costume drama buffs, and, especially, the music buffs.  The story of Mozart is compelling enough but the writer and director found an angle to view his life that reaches a level of excellence rarely seen in movie biographies.  The little-known composer; Salieri, is the protagonist and is played with excellence by F. Murray Abraham.  Frankly, I knew so little about the movie that I always thought the little-known Abraham got his Best Acting Oscar for portraying Mozart.<br /><br />This angle of viewing Mozart through the eyes of a jealous composer humanizes Mozart so well that a person can't help but be touched even more so by his life.  In the end, we bemoan the loss of both men's lives in the waste of a one-sided competition.  In the midst of this brilliant script is a bountiful gift of Mozart's music and it is delivered in just the right dose and just the right visual accompaniment.  Even if Mozart isn't your cup of tea, I doubt that you'll fail to be moved by his movements.  Well, I could go on and on but the point is, I am glad that I finally sat down to watch "Amadeus".  It is a reminder that artistry well-focussed has an appeal all its' own.</p></body></html>

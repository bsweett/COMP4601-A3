<meta name="summary" content="Ray Charles' courage and conflicts. A perfect film.  Bravo!"></head><body><p>I think that Ray Charles would have been pleased with the quality of this film about his life.  I understand he was involved in the project until shortly before his death.  No wonder Jamie Foxx did such a good job of depicting him.  He really did study the man and seemed to morph into him for the film.  It's not surprising he won an academy award for his performance.<br /><br />From the very beginning I was drawn into Ray's story which I had expected to be maudlin.  It wasn't.  Yes, he became blind as a child.  And yes, he had a traumatic childhood experience before that in which his little brother drowned in a washtub.  Through his child's eyes, he didn't realize the seriousness of the accident and didn't make any move to save him.  This incident had to effect him for the rest of his life.<br /><br />Ray's mother, however, wanted her little boy to be strong.  As he was going blind she refused to let him feel pity for himself.  Instead she taught him to cope with his blindness and even sent him off to a school for the blind in order to complete his education in becoming self sufficient.  And he certainly did become self-sufficient, traveling across the country by bus to find work in a club playing piano.  He was great.  And he was also exploited, especially because he was blind.  Eventually, he wised up and his career soared.<br /><br />He married a sweet woman and started a family.  But she never traveled on the road with him.  And he soon became involved with a whole series of other women.  He also became a heroin addict and fought these demons for most of his life.<br /><br />This is just the basic story.  How it was put together was what made this film glow.  The director wisely focused on Ray's courage and conflicts.  And, after a while, his being blind became only a part of this complex human being who we saw evolving on the screen.  What an extraordinary life this man had.  And what an extraordinary performance that Jamie Fox did.  The film was perfect.  I wouldn't change a word of it.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

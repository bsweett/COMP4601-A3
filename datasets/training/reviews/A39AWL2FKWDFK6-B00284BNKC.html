Set against the panoramic background of Brooklyn's Coney Island using some amazing cinematography courtesy of Matthew Libatique, the story surrounds a trio of young drug addled adults played respectively by Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly.  Leto playing Harry Goldfarb and Wayans playing Tyrone Love are low level drug dealers hoping to make that one big score.  Connelly is Leto's middle class girlfriend who has aspirations of becoming a fashion designer.  They find their dreams however slowly dissolving as their heroin habits increase and their existence becomes seamier and seamier.<br /><br />The unquestioned star of the film was Ellen Burstyn stupendously effectively portraying widowed housewife Sara Goldfarb.  Burstyn spends her days enthralled with an inspirational game show.  She receives a phone call informing her that she's been selected to appear as a contestant.  As a result she convinces herself to lose weight to improve her appearance.  Unable to diet she resorts to visiting a diet doctor.  Amazingly Burstyn gets hooked on diet pills and undergoes an astounding transformation with the help of a talented make up artist.  Her fantasy of appearing on TV gets replaced by drug induced hallucinations culminating in institutionalization.<br /><br />This is not a pretty movie but is very effective in elaborating how drugs destroy the hopes and dreams of the main characters.  The musical score and the special effects chronicling the ingestion of the pills and heroin were an excellent augmentation to the storyline.</p></body></html>

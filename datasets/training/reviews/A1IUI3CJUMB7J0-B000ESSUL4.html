From it;s opening credits it was shot beautifull and I loved the way the camera moved and the scebery but that's about it, that's the only good thing about this boring, no acting film. The acting is horriable there isa ctually no acting the actors stand around and deliver there lines, but what lines there is hardley no talking in this film. The story is long and has no life to it it drags on and on and on. Overall beautifull to watch but it dosent make this movie come close to being good.</p></body></html>

Never have been a fan of haunted doll movies much less haunted puppet movies. The only decent one I have ever seen was the now quite old "Magic" featuring Anthony Hopkins...made sometime in the mid to late 1970's. Ann Margaret was also in that movie and it is old enough that she still looked pretty darned good!<br />This movie is simply poorly done. Mr. Wahlburg does a pretty good job but the movie itself simply doesn't cut it for me.....didn't like it at all. Not suspenseful, not scary....just rather poor in just about every respect.</p></body></html>

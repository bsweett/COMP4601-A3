Starting off with a seven thousand dollar budget and a camera in hand, El Mariachi sparked the career of one of the most imaginative and sought after directors of our generation. He has not only taken up the responsibility of directing and writing the script for each of his films, but he has also acted as the composer, visual supervisor, editor, producer, production designer, and sound editor for several of them as well. Furthermore, not a single one of his films, including the visually complex and celebrity laden Sin City, was made for more then forty-million dollars, virtually unheard of in the modern Hollywood environment of one-hundred million dollars being the average price for a tent-pole project. Truly, Robert Rodriguez is a rogue of the film industry and his audience would not have it any other way.<br /><br />The story for Sin City not only meticulously blends seemingly individual plotlines together into a single cohesive feature film, but it also resonates the very characteristics that have made the film-noir genre so enticing and appealing to movie-goers over the years. More importantly, the script emphasizes a sad truth of life, which is that certain circumstances require morally corrupt individuals to put a stop to even more morally corrupt individuals from doing harm onto others. Sadly, unlike Superman and Spider-Man, not all comic-book heroes are as ethically heroic as would be believed. The only visible complexities within the script were the transition of one story arch to the next, which should have transferred more smoothly then it did, and the lack of connection in terms of intertwining characters and subplots between the three stories. It could have been more compelling and interesting had Rodriguez and Miller found a way to better blend the three separate storylines together, integrating several of the characters into blended scenes, more then the mere glimpse we receive of Marv in the bar that Hartigan steps into to search for Nancy, but it works fine enough as it stands.<br /><br />In spite of his appearance in numerous television productions since 1989, only in the last few years has British performer Clive Owen received recognition in Hollywood having been offered the leading role in the Jerry Bruckheimer production, King Arthur, and his Academy Award-nominated performance in Closer. Owen truly accentuates the role of Dwight, a rogue out to stop Jack Rafferty, performed by Benicio Del Toro, from harming the hookers of Old Towne, and his somber voice-over narration of the events depicted, typical of the film-noir genre, adds to the entertainment value. Del Toro's Jack Rafferty is the type of character which the audience would care to have a little more background information on in order to firmly grasp the concept of what is taking place in several scenes, but perhaps that is too much involvement then is required for some people.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke, a name of whom few within the current generation of young adult movie-goers would recall hearing before, has been long overdue for a comeback performance, appearing in The Rainmaker and The Thin Red Line, and he more then makes up for the string of commercial failures on his resume in the role of Marv. Observing his magnetic performance onscreen, it was as if Frank Miller, creator of the Sin City graphic comic series, created the figure of Marv specifically for Mickey Rourke, it is that comprehensive and enthralling. Though not the fault of the scriptwriting team, Jaimie King receives the short end of the performance stick in the role of Goldie given as how she dies within the first few minutes we see of her and even when she returns as Wendy, Goldie's twin sister, she doesn't do much beyond a few scenes with Rourke. And who better to fill the role of the silent and deadly cannibalistic assassin, Kevin, a young psychopath enlisted by the corrupt governmental structure of Sin City to kill off Goldie and pin the crime on Marv, then Elijah Wood? Was there honestly no one else within the same height structure as Wood that would have served as effectively in this role as he did? This is not meant to discredit his performance by any means. On the contrary, Wood turns what could have easily been an unintentionally derisive character into one of the most enigmatical and haunting figures in the film. The problem lies in the fact that when the audience sees Wood they automatically recall his performance as Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Ring trilogy and the effect his character is suppose to have on them goes down a slight notch or two because of this.<br /><br />Jessica Alba, better known for her involvement in the short-lived James Cameron television series, Dark Angel, on Fox, is stunning to say the least about her in the role of Nancy Callahan, the young potential rape victim who grows up to be a strong-willed exotic dancer. And while it is still a little early to make a judgment call as to whether she will have a longstanding career in the film industry seeing as how her role is limited to the `damsel in distress' caricature familiar to the film-noir genre, her performance holds up quite well opposite veteran actor Bruce Willis. Willis plays up the role of John Hartigan, quite possibly the only honest cop in the Sin City police force, with gusto, as he had done in such other gritty dramas as Pulp Fiction and Twelve Monkeys. It was fascinating to see the relationship which existed between Nancy Callahan and John Hartigan develop into a chivalrous `knight on a white horse riding to the rescue of his fair maiden in distress' love affair onscreen. And though this will certainly receive some negative feed back from some audience members, this in a way represents a double-standard in our society. Headlined prominently in such risqu&eacute; comedies as Sex in the City as well as in those insufferable tabloid newsmagazines, Mr. Willis being one of their more recent targets, is the belief that older women chasing after young men for sexual pleasure is perfectly acceptable while relationships which exist between older men and younger women is repulsive and depraved. Though this type of behavior may not exactly be everyone's cup of tea, there is certainly nothing morally objectionable to it given that it is for a loving relationship and not merely sexual intimacy alone and our society must comes to terms with this fact. Sure, it would have been nice for Rodriguez or Miller to have provided the audience with a bit more information concerning the previous sexual attacks made by Junior against young little girls in order to receive a better idea on the type of character that is being dealt with, but it is understandable enough that it is not required. In any event, Nick Stahl gives a decent, if not limited, performance in the role of the senator's son, eventually evolving into the monster known as the Yellow Bastard. Unfortunately, this thus mentioned character leaves several questions unanswered. Why did he become yellow? What is the cause of this horrible smell emulating from the bastard which is repeatedly mentioned by either Hartigan or others? Yes, these are minor, if not trivial, matters but when it comes to a feature this imaginative, nitpicking is going to be a result.<br /><br />Overall, in spite of its failure to emphasize a canonical point within its script, Sin City is nonetheless nothing short of visually arresting entertainment in the best sense of the word and serves as one of the more innovative feature film projects to crawl out of the works in recent years. Truly stunning in terms of its scope, direction, and graphic style, which is balanced out thanks to the exceptionally amplified performances of its cast members and the pertinent dialogue throughout the two-hour movie. As marveling as this presentation turned out to be, it should be noted that there were some, albeit trivial in respects, minor complaints to be made. Rodriguez and Miller had a captivating concept going when Marv discussed through narration how he was confused within his mind as to whether the actions he was taking were that of a justifiable avenger of his lover's death or merely the aspirations of a psychopathic killer everyone said he would be come to life, but instead is only focused on briefly before being lost in the shuffle. It would have been interesting to see what may have developed had this been expanded on in the script. And though the violence featured in Sin City is meant to be comical in nature, visualize it alone the lines as the fight sequences seen in Kill Bill Vol. 1, and not to be taken seriously, there were particular scenes in which it was too over the top to be taken seriously. For example, the scene in which Benicio Del Toro's Jack Rafferty had not only his hand cut off but also has his gun backfire into his forehead and has his head cut `like a Pez dispenser', went a little too far it seems and should have been cut down more cleanly. There is no problem with violence being featured prominently in live-action adult movies, but should it merely be violence for the sake of being violence, it doesn't make sense for the film to bite off more then it can chew. Still, the black and white visual quality of the film spliced with hints of iridescence, the scintillating reverberation of rain in the dark night of the back alleys, passionate and harrowing tales of chivalrous love affairs, and plenty of vital fluids and savagery to satisfy even the most hardcore of Taratino fanatics, are reasons enough to resurrect the hopes of movie-goers disillusioned over the years by the stale and unoriginal presentations and hoard them back to the local Cineplex in droves.</p></body></html>

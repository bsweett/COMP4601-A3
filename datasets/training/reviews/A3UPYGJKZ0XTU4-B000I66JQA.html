<meta name="summary" content="One Day. 3 Interesting Characters. 3 Great Performances."></head><body><p>In 1921 England, author Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) has been banished to the country to recover following a suicide attempt. While she wants desperately to return to a more stimulating environment in London, the ideas for her next novel "Mrs. Dalloway" begin to form in her mind. In 1951 Los Angeles, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a housewife with a loving husband and engaging little boy. But that life is unsuited to her and, finding it  unbearable, she seeks refuge in Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway". In New York City 2001, Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) is planning a party for an old friend. Her friend, a poet named Richard (Ed Harris), nicknamed her "Mrs. Dalloway" when they were young. Now he is dying, and Clarissa is left to reflect on their relationship and the life she has made for herself. <p>"The  Hours" is a character study of these three women, based on the novel by Michael Cunningham. The three women are very different in character and circumstance, but are linked, not only by "Mrs. Dalloway", but by their emotional isolation and the thoughts of death that engulf them. "The Hours" shows us only one day in the lives of each of these characters. We learn enough about them to make them interesting, but not so much as to  make them tedious. The performances by Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep, as well as the supporting cast, are excellent. Much has been made of the prosthetic nose which Nicole Kidman donned for her role as Virginia Woolf, and she truly is unrecognizable in the film. But it is her voice, which is changed as radically as her face, which transforms her into Woolf. Her performance really is impressive and may be her best work to date. Kidman easily holds her own next to the more experienced and acclaimed thespians, Streep and Moore. Meryl Streep's performance here is better than her Oscar-nominated turn in "Adaptation", so this is a must for Streep fans. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

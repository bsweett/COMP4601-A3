<meta name="summary" content="Perfectly Plotted - Makes Fans of Both Happy"></head><body><p>Freddy Vs. Jason pits two of the biggest names in slasher history together.  This movie works well for fans of both.  It has a Nightmare on Elm Street feel but a Friday the 13th atmosphere.  The plot works perfectly if you're a fan of both and it's a LOT better than the last few releases of both series.<br /><br />I won't give away any of the movie but I will talk about what the DVD includes.  An audio commentary from director Ronny Yu and Freddy and Jason.  It also includes plenty of deleted scenes, and alternate opening AND ending, featurettes, a music video and plenty more.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees, this is a must have.  If you're a casual fan, it's highly recommended.  Otherwise, it's worth a checking out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE AXMAN COMETH"></head><body><p>Clooney and Farmiga are both sensational in this extremely clever, brilliantly realized comedy that is by turns a wonderful character study, extremely romantic and painfully relevant to business practices in today's cut-throat corporate world. Clooney has simply, never been better, and how the Academy failed to give him an Oscar, for such an incredible performance is beyond me ( actually, the Academy of Motion Pictures has quite a history of sad choices, and obvious snubs- but that's another subject... ). There's a really good twist to the ending, and although it may not be the biggest of surprises, it certainly keeps the movie real. If you liked SIDEWAYS, you'll probably love this absolute 'peach.'</p></body></html>

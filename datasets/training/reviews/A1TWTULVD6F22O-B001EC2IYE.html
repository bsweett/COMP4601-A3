<meta name="summary" content="Clint Eastwood's Quiet Genius"></head><body><p>Although I personally preferred Eastwood's prior year adaption of "Mystic River"; there is no question that he crafted another superb film with "Million Dollar Baby", in a year that had no hobbits, and thus, not as much competition.  When you stand back and view Eastwood's growth as a director, the choices he makes, the marvelous way he inspires his actors, well, there's not the hype of Martin Scorsese, but there certainly is finer craftsmanship.  (Note:  Try to forget "Bloodwork"; in that Eastwood took a marvelous Connelly story and tripped it up by playing a role for which he was far too old. The miscasting eventually sunk the production.)<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is the story of a hard knocks kid, Maggie Fitzgerald, played by Hilary Swank.  Swank showed great ability in "Boys Don't Cry", but she's awaited a film and a script like this for years.  In Maggie, she comes of age.  In Maggie's life, the constant is the memory of her father, perhaps the only person who has ever been kind to her before.  Eastwood, as grizzled trainer Frankie, is less than kind, but grudgingly agrees to train her at the behest of his sidekick, Eddie (Morgan Freeman) a jack of all trades at Frankie's run down gym.<br /><br />Eddie's got a secret - he knows Frankie won't put his fighters in jeopardy, and he helps the hungriest of them leave to take risks at catching a title fight.  But Maggie, for whom Frankie has become the surrogate father (she's been missing since his death), refuses to leave the man who has given her the reason to go on.  She's a remarkable fighter, tough and needy, with skills sharpened by Frankie's tutelage, and, against all odds, she succeeds.  Maggie's inevitable downfall is caused by a world-class opponent, with few cares about how she takes Maggie out.  Indeed, although Eastwood pinpoints his focus to his three main characters, with only bit parts on the periphery, take note of Lucia Rijker, as Billie, the Blue Bear.  She plays her role with terrifying lust and need to win at all costs.  (She scared the hxxx out of me at the theater!)<br /><br />During Maggie's rise, perhaps the most touching aspect of the movie is the hook by Frankie in nicknaming her with a Gaelic phrase, one that makes every man and woman jack in each and every audience a fan.  Maggie never knows, until a particularly moving scene between Swank and Eastwood later on, just what it means.  And what it conveys is his love for her, his young fighter.  It's a love that he might have had for his own daughter, but in an intriguing aside, Eastwood gives us a shadow of Frankie's own personal tragedy involving his estrangement from that daughter, and his ongoing battle with his religious beliefs as to why it occurred.<br /><br />Freeman is a constant.  He was better in "Shawshank" and "Glory" than he is here...his contribution here is best in his narration.  Winning the Oscar for "Million" is an award for his fabulous body of filmwork, not just this one performance.  Eastwood, as Frankie, is spare and believable.  He throws all of what he has into the making of the film, but still leaves enough of himself on the table to weave intricately with the center performance of Swank.  The filming, costumes, music are all angular and supportive of the drama enacted in center stage; they are essential to the story, they do not detract.  And the twist of the film, after Maggie is injured, is a true to life drama that is played out on small stages all across this great land of ours.  I don't want to get into the controversy over assisted suicide, but frankly, Eastwood did not overplay his hand here, he just told the tale as it should be.<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby is a graceful testament to what good filmmaking is all about.  It deserved the Oscar, although it is not as good or as memorable as some of Eastwood's earlier work.  But the film will stay with you, winding through your subconscious, flashes of quiet brilliance, days after you leave the theater.</p></body></html>

It seems that a lot of times once a director directs a kid-friendly movie, a science fiction movie, or even an action film, that director will be branded that type of director for the remainder of his/her career.  The genre that is most notorious with this effect on director's careers would be the horror movie.  John Carpenter and Wes Craven being the two most popular directors that have always been branded horror directors.  Carpenter with his horror classics, "Halloween", "The Fog", and "The Thing", any time you hear the name John Carpenter you automatically think horror director.  Wes Craven is the same way, thanks in no small part to "A Nightmare On Elm Street", "New Nightmare", and the 'Scream' trilogy.  However, sometimes there are exceptions to the rule, and a director is able to escape the genre that has been his trademark for years, when this happens you know you'll be in for a unique movie-watching experience.  Because it is with these films that you get a new blend of two genres, the genre the director is most familiar with and whatever genre they are experimenting in for the first time.  Sometimes though it would be best for directors to stick to the genre they're best at; however, this is not the case for Wes Craven.  In 2005, Wes Craven stepped outside of the confines of horror films, and directed a white-knuckle thrill ride, "Red Eye", proving to critics and audiences that the difference between horror films and thrillers is merely a walk across the street.<br /><br />"Red Eye" takes place over the course of one day and night, when a very successful hotel manager, Lisa (Rachel McAdams) is forced to take the red-eye flight from somewhere in Texas back to her hotel in Miami because of a Homeland Security official who is coming into Miami and is staying in her hotel.  As the flight begins, the person sitting next to Lisa on the flight, a man named Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy), strikes up a conversation with Lisa that quickly turns from casual to creepy.  Jackson as it turns out is the middle-man in a plot to assassinate the very Homeland Security official that is staying in Lisa's resort, so he and his cohorts have devised a way to force Lisa into arranging everything at her hotel in a way that will leave the government official exposed and easier to assassinate.  As Lisa tries to outwit her apparent stalker, she is shown the one piece of leverage that the would be killers have that will stop Lisa in her tracks, her father will be killed if she will not comply.  Now, Lisa is in the fight for not only her life and the life of a government official, but also her father's.  All she has to rely on are her wits and courage, but will they be enough to save them all.<br /><br />Stepping outside of one's comfort zone has proved to be true box office gold for Wes Craven.  With incredible young actors Rachel McAdams ("The Notebook") and Cillian Murphy ("Batman Begins" and "28 Days Later"), alongside veteran actor Brian Cox ("Troy" and "The Bourne Identity"), fleshing out these characters in this well-written, incredibly tense thrill ride, Wes was sure to hit the bullseye.<br /><br />Though "Red Eye" does have an unusually short running time of around 82 minutes, it's probably the appropriate amount of time.  Since it's so short it allows Craven to constantly keep the atmosphere tense, and hardly allows for any down time for the audience to catch their collective breaths.  Sometimes keeping the intensity so high throughout the duration of a film works against the movie, for "Red Eye" it works to its advantage because of the shorter running time, and any sort of lull in the intensity would probably lower the thrill value of the film.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone looking for an intense thrill ride, that will leave you on the edge of your seats for the entire movie.  Definitely not a movie to be missed!<br /><br />"Red Eye" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></body></html>

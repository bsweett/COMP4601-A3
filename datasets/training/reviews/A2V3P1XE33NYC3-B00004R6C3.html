Few fans of the genre need a reminder that Carpenter directed the classic "Halloween," an independent film that went on to great success and eternal status as a cult classic. While the tale about the merciless Michael Myers certainly didn't invent the slasher film (look back to Mario Bava's classic "Twitch of the Death Nerve" to see an earlier effort), it influenced many others to carry the torch in the following years. Carpenter's recent films just don't compare with his early fright fests. That's a darn shame, but for horror aficionados, watching the troika of "Halloween," "The Fog," and "The Thing" will always deeply satisfy. My experiences with Carpenter's remake of "The Thing" centers on an amusing if slightly embarrassing story. When the film first came out back in the early 1980s, I was way too young to see it in the theaters. A friend of mine who did manage to witness the carnage returned with stories of horrors bleak enough to chill the blood. For some reason, the fear I felt from his whispered words stayed with me for years to come until I finally sat down to watch this masterpiece in my teens. Pathetic, huh?<br /><br />"The Thing" isn't as scary (although it does have a few nice shocks) as it is extremely gory. Imagine a crew of arctic researchers trapped in a base on Antarctica uncovering a gruesome, potentially apocalypse inducing alien being with the ability to assume the shape of any earthly life form. There's the basic summary of the movie. In Carpenter's remake, the cast of characters consists of a plethora of familiar actors instantly recognizable to both B-movie and general audiences. You've got Kurt Russell heading up the bill as the aloof MacReady, the base's helicopter pilot and the man to come to when everything falls apart. Wilford Brimley turns up as Blair, one of the base's doctors and the first man to recognize the earth shattering potential of The Thing. You've also got T.K. Carter as Nauls, David Clennon as Palmer, Keith David as Childs, Richard Dysart as Dr. Copper, Richard Masur as the dog keeper Clark, Donald Moffat as Garry, Charles Hallahan as Vance Norris, and Peter Maloney as George Bennings. I imagine many of these names don't mean much printed on a piece of paper, but once you watch the movie you'll see the cast forms a veritable who's who of main and supporting characters from dozens of memorable movies. The cast alone is a big reason "The Thing" succeeds wildly.<br /><br />The movie unfolds at a breakneck pace. Things start to go bad when a helicopter from the Norwegian base chases a dog into the American compound. Spraying bullets after the hapless pooch, the helicopter blows up when a carelessly dropped grenade explodes. Mystified by this weird behavior, the Americans stash the dog in the kennel and launch an expedition to the Norwegian base. They find everything destroyed, but they also find some film showing a weird discovery. Apparently, these poor chaps found a massive flying saucer in a crater, and what's more they found something nearby frozen in the ice. Sure enough, when they brought this thing back to the base, it defrosted and subsequently decimated its discoverers. By the time MacReady and his fellows discover that the dog carries the alien creature, and that it shape shifts easily, the game is afoot. Paranoia and panic rapidly set in as no one in the group can be absolutely sure that the beast hasn't taken over the other guys. At least they figure out that the alien despises fire, but by then it's far too late to do much. Most of the crew perished in the struggle to stay alive and uncontaminated. The movie boasts one of the best conclusions in horror film history.<br /><br />There is so much to like about Carpenter's film that it's hard to pin down one specific element of success. As a huge gore fan, I probably ought to focus attention on the gruesome special effects. Constructed by effects guru Rob Bottin, the prosthetics and other amazing wizardry on display here stuns the eye and boggles the mind. You've got dogs turning into masses of writhing tentacles, chest cavities turning into giant teeth, heads morphing into spider-like creatures, and other ghastly, gluey nightmares. And it's all done without CGI! But the gore isn't the whole movie--not by a long shot. You also get an increasing sense of pervasive doom as the research team struggles to survive. Think about it; you're stuck in an inhospitable environment with no way out while an alien creature methodically chases you down. I think I'd go insane, and some of the crewmembers do exactly that, but others step up to the challenge. "The Thing" is definitely one of those films that forces you to examine your own thoughts in an effort to discover which camp you would fall into if faced by similar circumstances.<br /><br />The extras on the Collector's Edition disc are extensive and massively entertaining, perhaps the best extras I've ever seen on a DVD. You get a commentary track with Kurt Russell and John Carpenter, a lengthy documentary about the film with cast and crewmembers, trailers, outtakes, storyboards, stills, and text documents about the conception of the film. I sat enraptured by these extras, although the text stuff tends to repeat things you'll hear in the documentary. The best thing about the extras is listening to Rob Bottin tell stories about the troubles he had pulling off the special effects work. He comes across as one of those guys who can make any story hilarious because of their vocal inflections and mannerisms. This DVD is one of the best out there; I hope they put it back on the market soon.</p></body></html>

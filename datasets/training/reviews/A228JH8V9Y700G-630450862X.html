Stephen King created Carrie thanks to a few happenstances.  He was working for a laundry service when one day they were in a women's locker room, and he saw the dispense of feminine hygiene products.  He asked someone what it was, a coworker told him.  He had just read an article about telekinisis, and that night he went home and wrote the first scene of Carrie, when she gets her period in the shower and it awakens the power within her.  He threw it away, but a few days later he came home to find his wife, Tabitha, had dug it out of the trash.  When she asked if he had writen this, he said it was just an idea he'd had but didn't like it.  Per her insistance, he went on to write more.  Tabitha told him "No this is good, you've got something here."  Tabitha helped him, as it was a story about girl stuff.  He based Carrie on the two ugliest girls he knew growing up, and her mother around a devoutly religious woman he worked with who he always wondered what her home life was like.  It was submitted and published, and Stephen King had his first big hit.  And, the rest is history.<br /><br />Carrie is the story of a squelched, nervous outcast.  It takes place in the most horrifying of places, high school.  Pushed around, teased relentlessly, and made to feel the butt of every joke, Carrie is trapped between the laughter of her peers and the heavy handed world of her mother's religious beliefs.  She's odd, afraid, nervous.  Then, one day, when the late bloomer reaches maturity right in the middle of the gym locker room shower and made a fool of by the other girls, the power is awakened within her.  Suddenly she has the power to think and effect people.  When that mean boy down the street harasses her on his bike, she throws him an angry glare and he falls off his bike.  When in the second half, one of the girls from the locker room, Sue Snell, feels guilty about her behavior, she does something completely out of character for a "popular girl".  SHe not only feels guilty, but asks her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom to make up for it.  Her boyfriend Tommy, the handsome, equally popular all American nice guy agrees, and they go to the prom.  Carrie, in the one and only time she ever had a real date, looked pretty as a picture, and is even voted queen, is subjected to the ultimate humiliation when the queen bee and her legion of thugs dump pig blood on her.  Carrie uses her telekinetic powers to take out her revenge, and burns down the town, killing hundreds in her path.<br /><br />Why is this such a great story?  Because it speaks to each and every one of us on some level.  Rebelling against the old world parent, lashing out at teachers who were too meddlesome or ignorant.  Transforming from an ugly ducking into a swan, and the handsome prince comes riding in a white horse to take us to his enchanted kingdom (in this case, the prom).  Having hope that you can break out of your social mold, that you too can be everything you secretly wanted to be.  And when the final insult comes, the one that breaks you, the one that you can't just turn the other cheek this time, you can kill them all with your secret power that you always wished you had.<br /><br />This was a long time ago, and it shows.  Political correctness has overtaken us (the bullying aspect that might have lead Carrie to mow everyone down with an assult riffle if she didn't have the power), fashion has changed, etc.  And the shrillness of the acting, corny, antiquated special effects make it just as campy rather than a serious drama / horror now (thanks mostly to Mrs. White played hilariously by Piper Laurie).  And yet, add the element of the fanatic mother who is really REALLY crazy (and happened to put all her crazy energies into Christianity rather than the bottle, self mutilation, or promiscuity) yet somehow right all along about people really gives us something to think about in the end.  A timeless classic.</p></body></html>

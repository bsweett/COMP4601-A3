<meta name="summary" content="A Fine Follow Up!"></head><body><p>4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />Adrenalized charged follow up to "28 Days Later, "28 Weeks Later" may not have the formers stark eeriness of waking up to a empty London, or at least what is thought as a empty London, but it more than makes up for it in action. It more than makes up for it in terror. It may not have the character development of the former, but it's storyline of a family tore apart from the "Rage" virus is definitely heartening & angering at the same time. It's story of the bond of a brother & sister is very moving, well acted & executed.<br /><br />Yes, the two movies are different, but in many ways equal. Danny Boyle is not at the directors helm for this one, but new director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo infuses the film with his own brand of maniacal mayhem. The editing is fasted paced, more so than the first. The storyline of the US Military overseeing the survivors of the virus is a interesting & logical one. The sense of fear & terror are well done, especially the subway scene.<br /><br />All in all this film stands on it's own very well as a major contribution to it's genre. When all it's parts are summed up, it's a great sequel, though not quite as profound as "28 Days Later," nor anywhere as complex in charcter development, hence just a tad inferior, but in a oversaturated genre of Zombies & Zombie like humans, "28 Weeks Later" is a highly recommended terror fest!<br /><br />"28 Weeks Later" 2007</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Legal Cover-up/Thriller"></head><body><p>Filmed in New York and Wisconsin, George Clooney and Sydney Pollack provide excellent performances, as do the other actors. Michael Clayton (Clooney), once a brilliant litigator for a legal firm, has become a "fixer".  He "fixes" things.  He gets caught up in a web of deceit and cover-up and finds out something that puts his life in jepoardy.  Although a little slow, it is not too slow.  It is interesting watching the plot and characters unfold.  It is about the legal system, law suits, and cover-ups and is similar in plot to the Erin Brockovitch movie.</p></body></html>

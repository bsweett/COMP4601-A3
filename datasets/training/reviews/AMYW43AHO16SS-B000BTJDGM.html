<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Struggle Between Religion and Science!"></head><body><p>What struck me about this film was the interesting debate between theological speculation and scientific reasoning.  Was Emily Rose's death caused by a evil spirit or was it murder?  Laura Linney and Oscar Nominee Tom Wilkinson give strong performances in this very intriguing motion picture.  Director Scott Derrickson does a great job of trying to keep our interest by giving both side of the arguement without trying to insult our inteligence with a ridiculous and predictable storyline.  A more inexperienced director would have tried to shock us with blood and gore, turning it into a forgetable "B" movie.  By not taking the low road, this film actually becomes rather entertaining and spiritual. Don't let the title fool you.  Give this movie a chance.  You might like it, as I did!</p></body></html>

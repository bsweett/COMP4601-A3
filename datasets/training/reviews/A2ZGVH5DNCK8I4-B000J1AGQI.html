<meta name="summary" content="Not for country ,not for honor but for each other."></head><body><p>Randall Wallaces couragous at times haunting story about Lt.<br />Gen Al Moore who led his troops in 1965 in the first major battle<br />of Vietnam is probly the most honest portrayal of Veitnam it is<br />in no way as striking and as brillant as Saving Private Ryan the<br />father of the modern day war film, but it shows Vietnam in a way<br />that it has never been shown before.As a family man Moore is a<br />commited father of his children and a loving husband to his wife<br />,As a soldier he is a caring but gutsy soldier that is willing to<br />do what he is orderd even though it may cost him the lives of his<br />company or his own life.<p>  In 1955 when the French were massacred by the south Vietnamese<br />Lt, Moore knew that they would be calling him to war and he would<br />have to make that solem promise to his company that he would look<br />out for them and bring them back even if any of them fall in war<br />but he never knew that he would have to make them a promise that<br />would happen , In a scene that looks like that of Apocalypse Now<br />the outbound helicopters carry Moore and his men unto the grassy<br />feilds of Veitnam with only one thought in his head how many will<br />not come home to there familys and will he ever get to see his own family again.<p>  Starring into the face of the enimey his men blocked and I'll equiped and seeing them being cut to shreds by enimey fire<br />the promise that he made to his company all but vanished,The<br />soldiers wives unsure that they will see there husbands again<p>children waiting to see if they will ever be able to hug there<br />father again.This deep in Moore mind as he is in a desprate<br />battle that someone orderd him to do but he can't turn back,<br />Wallace also focuses on the enimeys side as we see how the<br />enimey experiences.When it's all said and done Moore wonders<br />why he did not fall insead of his soldiers for they did not<br />come there for honor or country they came there for each<br />other an inspirering and worth while honest portrayal<br />of the Veitnam war and how soldiers delt with it.</p></body></html>

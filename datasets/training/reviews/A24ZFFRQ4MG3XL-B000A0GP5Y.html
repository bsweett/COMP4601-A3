<meta name="summary" content="What happened to the Sandman?"></head><body><p>I'm sorry to have to say this, but this sucked.  I love Adam Sandler.  He's great.  Normally.  This wasn't his best work and it's a shame because there was potential to get this made better.  I haven't seen the original, but I believe it was a poor remake.  I loved Courtney Cox.  Burt Reynolds I can't stand.  I loved all the inmates bodies.  But the humour lacked a little and the stupidity was high.  Please do better next time.</p></body></html>

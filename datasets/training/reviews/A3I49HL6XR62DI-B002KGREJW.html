<meta name="summary" content="No matter what, they're family"></head><body><p>The story of a family of real oddballs who are determined to take the little daughter to California to participate in the Little Miss Sunshine pagent. Satirical, touching, hysterically funny and terribly sad, this film is a must-see. The entire cast is incredibly good. Standout performances from Abigail Breslin (the daughter), Greg Kinnear (the father), Alan Arkin (grandpa), and Steve Carrell (the disallusioned, suicidal gay brother). Highly, highly recommended. Oscars all around for this film!</p></body></html>

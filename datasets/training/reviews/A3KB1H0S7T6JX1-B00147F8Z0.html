<meta name="summary" content="A movie worth watching"></head><body><p>Aliens vs. Predator Requiem picks up immediately where AVP Alien vs. Predator left off and the adventure starts with a bang.<br />I have to say that I am not a MAJOR fan of either the Alien or the Predator series, though I've seen all the previous movies and liked them. So, I cannot take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have. Therefore, coming from someone that is not familiar with the "details" I have to say that the movie was pretty good!<br />The acting is actually much better than its immediate predecessor (it was GREAT seeing Reiko Aylesworth from 24!), though the setting is not as good; AVP's Tomb Raider/Indiana Jones feel was definitely a bonus! Nevertheless, it is another action-packed thriller combining elements of adventure and horror.<br />The plot, the acting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the battle scenes, are all very good!<br />In conclusion, Aliens vs. Predator Requiem is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!</p></body></html>

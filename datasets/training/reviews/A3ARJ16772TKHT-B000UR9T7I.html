However, it tries to be much more than it is. For instance, the first movie had the Green Goblin. The second movie had Doc Oc. This outing has three--count 'em---three villains.<br /><br />Of course, this depends on the way you count the villains. One starts bad but turns good at the last minute. One starts of not "good" but aligned with Spider-man, then turns on him after being forcibly rejected. And one is presented as the escape convict with the misguided heart of gold.<br /><br />That being said, with so many villains whose story needs to be told, the story of Spider-man 3 ends up just feeling too rushed. There's too much story to be told here.<br /><br />My personal preference, if they insisted on making a movie with Venom, would actually be to present the symbiote in this movie, merged with Spider-man only. Then, after Peter realized what it was doing to him, he'd ditch it at the end of the movie, and end on the shot of Eddie Brock getting attacked/assimilated by the symbiote just before the fade-to-black, indicating that Venom would be the main villain of the fourth movie. (Similar to Harry finding his father's Goblin lair at the end of movie 2.)<br /><br />But that's just me.<br /><br />In the end, this movie was a missed opportunity that tried to be too much.</p></body></html>

By off-the-wall, I mean anything from FIGHT CLUB or THE BEACH to DONNIE DARKO.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher plays a young man who, after suffering childhood blackouts, discovers a way of stepping back into his past through self-hypnosis.  When he tries to help other kids and their traumas by changing his past, he wakes up in an altered present filled with radical, sometimes-horrible differences.<br /><br />Sounds complicated, but the movie's pretty easy to follow (just pay attention).<br /><br />The DVD comes with the Theatrical Version and the Director's Cut.  The endings are different but they both worked for me.<br /><br />Cool story.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="REALLY DISAPPOINTING! ONE OF THE WORST MARVEL MOVIES"></head><body><p>remember buying the Amazing Spider-man issue that first features the Punisher. I was never a die hard fan,but certainly thought he was cool. I wanted to like this movie and thought it would be one of the better Marvel Comic films.......I was wrong! This movie was really bad and my 2 star rating is generous! I don't even know where to begin with what went wrong. They did not capture the dark,gritty essence of the comic book! The movie was almost laughable! I have not seen the director's cut yet,but I really don't think they can fix this one with some added scenes. If your a fan your gonna buy it any way,but I don't think it's worth the 1/2 inch space it takes on my DVD shelf!</p></body></html>

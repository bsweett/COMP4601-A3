The horror master blends atmosphere, music and chills like no one else. Halloween and The Thing are constantly fighting for first place, but this hair-raising ghost tale is close behind those two. The setting (isolated fishing town), creepy story, one of my favorite musical scores and some revenge seeking ghost pirates makes The Fog a movie worthy of much more praise than most people seem to remember. I try to watch it at least once a year around Halloween time. It just gets me in the mood for my favorite holiday. Too bad John Carpenter hasn't made a decent movie in decades, but the three I mentioned in my review are horror flicks I admire everytime I watch them. They don't make them like this anymore.</p></body></html>

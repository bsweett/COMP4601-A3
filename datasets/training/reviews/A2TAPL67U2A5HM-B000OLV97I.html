<meta name="summary" content="Eragon (Widescreen Edition)"></head><body><p>Eragon (Widescreen Edition) is a movie based on the book by the same title by Christopher Paolini. Not having read the books I did not come in with any expectations how it should be. However, even so I do have the feeling that the movie feels short. The storyline could have been much more developed and some of the scenes just seem rushed. For instance the growth of the dragon happens in an instance. The special effects are alright but nothing special. While I am not a disappointed as many as the other reviewers I can still say that I can only give this movie a 3 out of 5. Maybe a directors cut will come and settle things right. 3/5.</p></body></html>

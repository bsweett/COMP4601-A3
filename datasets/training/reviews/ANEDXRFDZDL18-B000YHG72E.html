<meta name="summary" content="Cute Kids Film"></head><body><p>Elf is a cute bit of fluff  about a human orphan (Buddy) who grows up as a the foster son of an elf at the North Pole. Will Ferrell  stars as the tights-wearing, permed elf, Buddy. Bob Newhart  stars as his foster father and James Caan stars as his biological father. When Buddy has difficulty making his quota of toys, he begins to question himself. Overhearing from some of the other workers that he's really a human and NOT an elf, he decides to go to the real city to find his biological father.<br /><br />I really liked most of Elf, with the exception of two things: there were a few 'sophomoric humor scenes such as when Buddy is eating used chewing gum off the rail in the subway in New York, and scenes where Buddy is eating spaghetti with maple syrup. (Gag). And the rather annoying message that: Biological fathers are somehow superior to adopted fathers. I was disappointed that after Buddy found his biological father he ditched his elf dad and and wanted to become human. Say what? I wish Hollywood wouldn't perpetuate this myth that biology is somehow better than adopted parents. (Sigh).<br /><br />Other than those minor peeves, this was a cute funny movie sure to please the kiddies or the kids at heart.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More drama than comedy"></head><body><p>This was an interesting and captivating film.  Captivating because you really will want to watch it to the end.  One thing though, I really didn't consider this a comedy.  It didn't have the laugh out loud funny moments that you would expect in a comedy and the funny moments seemed forced and placed in the film only to give it a comedic edge (a car getting wrecked, an accident during a basketball game).  There is really something un-funny about a man threatened with losing his job when his family needs him the most, and to see his co-workers lose their jobs.  The Topher Grace character was really great in this film as young "Carter," a hotshot marketing guy who finds himself thrust into ad sales.  The relationship between Dan (Dennis Quaid) and Carter's daughter also suprised me.  I was under the impression before I saw the film that Carter was going to be his new boss and then he was going to find out that she was dating his daughter.  Not so, he meets the daughter for a second time at Dan's house.  I didn't think the relationship between Alex (Scarlet Johanson) and Carter was well developed.  It was like they chilled one time and then were on the fast track.  At the beginning of their relationship (which received very little screen time), she seems to have no concerns or regards for getting intimate with her fathers boss.  At times I was wondering if she was getting close to him to help save her fathers job.  Another thing about her character I found was odd, it seemed to me that her voice changed during the movie.  In the beginning when she was in full tom boy mode her voice had much more base than when she let her hair down and started attending college in the city.  Overall, it is an entertaining movie, nothing I would want to watch again, but it was interesting although a bit predictable at times.  Dan fell down so much you just knew he was going to make a rebound before the movie ended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Baloney on Wry"></head><body><p>Though large chunks of the "Collateral" plot are preposterous, taken with a pinch of salt and tongue in cheek, it's a highly entertaining thrill ride through the streets of Los Angeles, while cab driver Jamie Foxx is taken hostage by sociopath hit man Tom Cruise. Foxx spends the night from hell as Cruise uses his cab for "work," and tries to find a way out of his predicament.<br />The film looks great, with lots of dazzling overhead shots of a bright lights and glitter LA, and it sounds good too, with a score by James Newton Howard, and some pleasant non-original music. There are many moments of humor with some witty lines between the two leads, who have a marvelous "anti-chemistry" between them, and director Michael Mann keeps the pace so fast, that as we zip from scene to scene, we don't fully realize how absurd the story is.<br /><br />The cast is excellent; Cruise with gray hair and beard is in one of his best recent roles, and portrays the sadistic Vincent with a cool and cutting edge, and Foxx is terrific as the beleaguered cabbie Max. Both are in peak athletic shape, and do their share of some fast running. Jada Pinkett Smith is beautiful as a prosecuting attorney, but it is a thankless role, and she is not much more than a plot device. Others in the cast include Spanish actor (and new international star) Javier Bardem in a small part as Felix, Mark Ruffalo as Fanning, and Peter Berg as Weidner.<br />Put reasoning on hold, and you'll enjoy this splashy thriller, and what is ultimately a bizarre "buddy film."<br />Total running time is 120 minutes.</p></body></html>

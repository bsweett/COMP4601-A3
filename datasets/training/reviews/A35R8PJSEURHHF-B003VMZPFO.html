The message they were trying to get across was how the government can just do whatever it wants; however, they really didn't push that issue to make it anything really significant.<br /><br />They made the actors stupid in this movie.  They would repeatedly split up causing one or the other to be attacked, and then saved, only to go to the next location and split up again.  The woman even sits down in front of a huge restaurant window, enjoying a glass of water (bottle not good enough when you're running for your life), knowing that the crazies and military were looking for them. If people were after me I'd stay out of sight and check every room I walked in.</p></body></html>

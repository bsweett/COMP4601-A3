That's exactly what happened to John Waters' "Hairspray", one of his most conventional movies made (if a John Waters movie could ever be considered conventional!). Taking his marvelous mid-eighties movie, it was adapted into a spunky, fun Broadway musical, which in turn, would naturally move back to the screen in 2007. The results? A high-spirited romp of cinematic fun that makes it impossible to sit and not tap your toes.<br /><br />Tracy Turnblad, hefty teenager with a yen for dancing, longs to be a council member on Baltimore's "Corny Collins" show. Tracy is the heroine of today: polished, joyful, and unabashedly herself. Tracy tries out for the show, but is rebuffed by stodgy henmother Velma, who only looks out for bratty beautiful daughter Amber. Tracy is undeterred, fenagling her way on to the show via moves she learned from resident detention student Seaweed, who had a thing for Penny, Tracy's friend. All the while, Tracy's mother, Edna, lives at home and tries to protect her only offspring from the world, unsuccessfully, eventually "coming out" herself. Throw in a magnificent civil rights story line, and you get the world of Hairspray.<br /><br />What amazes about this film is the sheer energy that director Adam Shankman injects into this cinematic riot. It literally is impossible not to tap the toes, and I daresay, had it been possible, I would have been up in the theater aisles trying to move like these pulsating kids. Every scene is alive. Shankman has said that this whole film is imagined through the eyes of innocent Tracy, who walks around hearing music in her head all day long. It pays off. The dancing is THE best in recent film, and is only matched by the stellar performances.<br /><br />To be honest, when I first heard John Travolta was Edna, I thought "Eesh". Two seconds into watching his performance, I thought, "Wow". He not only steals Edna from the impressive Harvey Fierstein, but reinvents her into a shy, emerging violet of a woman. When she dances in the finale, you are so with her, err him, that her dance of joy makes you joyful. Queen Latifah gives Motormouth Maybell a sense of dignity and pride. And it's Nikki Blonsky's Tracy, who is the center of this film, who is so obviously in love with music, dancing, and herself, that makes her an incredible protagonist.<br /><br />Hairspray is ultimately about the joy of finally doing the right thing. When the cast sings "You Can't Stop the Beat", it's about the tide of the Civil Rights movement affecting one small thing in a great universe. But it's also about people accepting each other. And it's about how the world, no matter how hard you try, will always spin on.</p></body></html>

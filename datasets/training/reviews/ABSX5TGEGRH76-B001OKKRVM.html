<meta name="summary" content="An Intriguing Documentary"></head><body><p>I still find it pretty amazing how a documentary could end up being one of the summer of 2005's biggest money-makers.  However, this is a great documentary, and there wasn't too much competition.  March of the Penguins, narrated in English by Morgan Freeman (this is a French movie) tells the incredible story of what emporor penguins have to go through in order for their species to survive.<br /><br />Every year, emporor penguins across Antarctica have to trek over 70 miles from the edge of the continent to nearly the center of the continent, braving harsh conditions, in order to meet and mate with other penguins.  And that is only the beginning.<br /><br />Beautifully photographed, it feels like we're there in Antarctica with the penguins (there are a few shots that I feel are a little TOO close), and wonderfully narrated by Freeman with moments of comedy to punctuate the "drama".<br /><br />While I wouldn't advise owning this, it is definitely worth watching once.</p></body></html>

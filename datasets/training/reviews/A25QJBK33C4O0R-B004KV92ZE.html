<meta name="summary" content="DreamWorks delivers on family friendly animated feature"></head><body><p>DreamWorks seems to have struck gold with this nice family friendly film.  Top-notch animation, a humorous performance that isn't too silly and a great story about finding the Dragon Master from within shine through on the disc-based version of this film (at least it shines very nicely on the Blu-ray disc).<br /><br />As some have noted the Blu-ray package unfortunately doesn't include all of the material of the DVD package, but it doesn't mean those with Blu-ray players shouldn't grab this excellent disc.  The animation comes through extremely well and the level of detail in this Blu-ray rivals that of a disc I would previously have called reference quality (the Disney movie about a rat named Remy ;-)).<br /><br />Don't fear investing in this disc as it's sure to be a treasured addition to your own collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GREAT FUN now in HIGH DEFINITION!!! can you ask for more?"></head><body><p>I love this film. Tim Burton really did a wonderful job creating that kind of atmosphere no other director can create... and the cast is superb!<br /><br />Johnny Depp delivers one of his most offbeat performances... and Christopher Walken as the headless horseman... and Michael Gambon... all are great.<br /><br />Now about the things you want to know... the image here is top notch. Crystal clear, high definition picture as you've never seen - which is interesting: since the film has a dark cinematography you'll be amazed how well the High Def takes advantage of all it can do to give you a kind of image you'll think you only get in a movie theatre.<br /><br />In fact, to see the forest with all the fog and those trees in gorgeous high definition is a trully cinematic experience. And I do believe this is one of those movies who beg for high definition - And this HD-DVD edition delivers it just as you'd expect: flawlessly.<br /><br />And when it comes to sound... boy, this is incredible... an umbelievable bass runs through my living room as the horse gallops through the woods. All I can say is thast I've rarelly seen a sound design job as well done as this!<br /><br />Get this HD-DVD for a true cinematic experience!</p></body></html>

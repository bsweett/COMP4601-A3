<meta name="summary" content="Forgot Just How Great This Film Really Is..."></head><body><p>This is by far the best romantic comedy I have ever seen, and I admit being a guy I haven't really seen that many. The thing that seperates this film from most is the power to make you bust out in laughter one second and wiping away tears the next. Jack Nicholson delivers my favorite performance of his career and deserved that Oscar, as did Helen Hunt in her best role. I truly think Greg Kinnear deserved the Oscar over Robin Williams in &quot;Good Will Hunting.&quot; Jack was weirdly great, but Kinnear was so convincing as the soul of the movie, who helped mold others around him rather than changing himself or his past. Also, this movie has almost as many great quotes as Monty Python or the Princess Bride and thats really saying something. So, if you want to see an excellent movie for a nice romantic evening with someone special or if you just want to watch a movie that will have you cherishing it long after the fading bakery scene, buy this movie for the extremely worthy and reasonable price.</p></body></html>

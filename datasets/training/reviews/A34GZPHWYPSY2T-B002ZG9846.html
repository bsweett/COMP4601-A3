<meta name="summary" content="That was an Armenian with mental problems"></head><body><p>Never in my born days did I suspect London, England, could double for New York City - with Elstree and Pinewood studios offering the rest of the necessary sets. Here it works, and that is one of the many things I love about KICK-ASS (a/k/a KICKASS). Though I'm fairly certain I spotted some familiar London street scenes.<br /><br />The sweet-looking newcomer Aaron Johnson [(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHPU">The Illusionist (Full Screen Edition)</a> as the young "Eisenheim"] plays David Lizewski, a typical high school kid who longs to be a superhero after it dawns on him that we need superheroes. He orders a unique wetsuit online, and in no time becomes KICK-ASS, New York's answer to Batman. He knows very well, as he admits in his ongoing narrative, that the going won't be so easy. His first time out proves that, but I will not spoil it here. Suffice it to say it is so funny I almost fell to the floor. No kidding.<br /><br />Cutting across the story of KICK-ASS is the story of Batman lookalike "Big Daddy" (Nicholas Cage) and his well-trained 11-year old daughter "Hit-Girl" (a delightfully brash and foulmouthed Chlo? Grace Moretz) - these are the true superheroes with money, equipment and attitudes from hell to back their plays. Kick-Ass becomes famous through the miracle of the internet, and I loved the brief but powerful parody of internet fame. Kick-Ass receives pleas for help thereby, he meets Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. It is then he learns exactly what he has chosen for his vocation, a bit too late, one might say.<br /><br />This film is not for the faint of heart, yet is so hilarious, with its common touch, that it is riveting. I'm not really sure what I thought of a lethally trained pre-adolescent girl equally proficient with firearms and knives. All I can say is I'd be damned proud if I had a daughter like her. (My wife is like her, though.) Nicholas Cage seems gaunt and grouchy, but his character is worth 1,000 words. It is the one critique I have: Cage and Johnson should each have had their own separate films.<br /><br />Perhaps that is in the works, but I doubt Cage or anyone like him will return. You will see for yourself why that is. In the end, everyone learns what the price of "super" power really is. As Kick-Ass says, with no power there is no responsibility, but ... we all know the end of that sentence.<br /><br />Running straight into the evil mob boss Frank D'Amico (the incredible Mark Strong doing an excellent NYC accent), the superheroes all end up paying a heavy price indeed. Again, I will not spoil this either.<br /><br />A few observations:<br /><br />1. Aaron Johnson is one of the most handsome stars I've ever seen this side of Ryan Phillippe. As this film strives to demonstrate in very funny ways, he's allegedly not gay ... he certainly seems to be to me. Johnson's engagement to a forty-something-year-old broad (director of Johnson's other "big" film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036TGT5M">Nowhere Boy</a>) when he was 19 is basically THE 'gay red flag' of the decade. So bear in mind as you see this film, Johnson was already engaged to a woman old enough to be his mother - and then some.<br /><br />2. This film could have done well without as much cheesy music (come on, Elvis?!), but it is for the most part a powerful soundtrack. Some song that I think is called "Town Ain't Big Enough for the Both of Us" is awesome.<br /><br />3. Director Matthew Vaughn (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010Z32OA">Stardust</a>) has a real feel for heroes: he outdoes the wretched WATCHMEN though I admit there'd be none of this without that original comic.<br /><br />Why are the British doing all this cool stuff? It took me 1/2 hour to realize everyone in the film is British except for Nicholas Cage and perhaps two others. It took me until the final credits to realize it was all filmed in London. No wonder some of the characters gave me the creeps - you know, the willies you get from an "American" who just doesn't sound right.<br /><br />Keep <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007A2GSW">The Incredibles (Full Screen Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> near to hand if you are fainthearted, I'm warning you fair and square. KICK-ASS does not skimp on the reality of the violence, but it is not gratuitous or disgusting like, say, SIN CITY (which is cited in this film). The skilled way it switches between violence and comedy is refreshing. I think it drives home the fact that violence is NOT funny or light-hearted.<br /><br />Get this and stew in the first viewing a while before seeing it again: it will inform you deeply about your hidden feelings regarding vigilantism, violence, pop culture and comic books. They are all related, and I've never seen a film explain that intimate connexion like this does.</p></body></html>

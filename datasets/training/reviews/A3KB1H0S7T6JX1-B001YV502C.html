<meta name="summary" content="Not Bad, but Not Great either"></head><body><p>Children of Men transports us to the year 2027 where the world has not experienced a new birth in 18 years due to mass human infertility.  As a result, people have lost hope and have turned violent.  Suddenly, a pregnant woman capable of producing life appears out of nowhere and the chase is on...<br /><br />In short, the acting is pretty good (but nothing wonderful), the plot is quite interesting, while the dialogues are average and sometimes below average.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  No masterpiece here.</p></body></html>

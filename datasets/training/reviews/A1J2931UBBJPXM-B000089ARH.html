<meta name="summary" content="It's About Music, It's About Life"></head><body><p>It's 1973, San Diego, California; an exceptionally bright fifteen-year-old aspiring journalist with his heart in rock n' roll goes after an interview with a heavyweight metal band in town for a concert, and winds up tagging along on tour with a band called Stillwater, in "Almost Famous," a semi-autobiographical story from writer/director Cameron Crowe.  And once the bus leaves, it's music, mirth, mayhem and an unforgettable, career-launching experience for young William Miller (Patrick Fugit), as he gets a first hand look at what living the life of a rock musician is all about.  It's a lot to take in, but Miller's intelligence and adaptability belies his youth and he eases into his role quite naturally, with a little help from a couple of new friends:  Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), leader of the groupie elite "Band aids," following Stillwater on their tour; and Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), who plays lead guitar for the band.  For young William it's a foray into a real fantasy world, through which he conducts himself professionally and objectively; quite a triumph considering his previous experience as a writer was limited to a few unsolicited submissions to "Rolling Stone" and "Creem" magazines, from which he received, up to this point, no response whatsoever.  His only real link to any of it, in fact, has been a chance encounter with Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), editor of Creem, who ultimately becomes something of an anchor to reality for Miller.  Cameron Crowe has given us a brilliant film that works on a number of levels; it's entertaining and insightful, delivered from his own unique perspective and presented objectively and without moralizing.  It's like an excellent piece of journalism committed to film, which enables the audience to make that necessary emotional connection that makes it all so satisfying.  Whether or not you even like rock n' roll, it's undeniably a force that has long since been ingrained in the universal consciousness of the world, and Crowe has captured the essence of it's soul in this movie.  There are characters and moments here with which everyone will be able to readily identify; from Miller's mother, Elaine (wonderfully played by Frances McDormand), the professor who cannot understand the music and fears the influence of it on her children, to the kid who just loves the music, to those obsessed and taken over by it.  It's a detailed look at what it means to be, not necessarily a rock "star," but a struggling band grabbing for the brass ring, and how it affects the lives of so many people directly and indirectly involved.  Crowe takes it deep and demonstrates the upside as well as the down, in a way that sparks the imagination without being too graphic.  It's a movie that allows you to experience the exhilarating, sometimes manic highs as well as the unpleasantness that must accompany it, but Crowe takes pains to deliver the message without ever taking you into unnecessarily dark or murky waters.  He maintains a delicate balance throughout the film that gives it both conscience and credibility.  There are a number of memorable performances, beginning with Fugit, who does such a great job of conveying the maturity of his character, which makes him so believable.  Billy Crudup and Jason Lee (as lead singer Jeff Bebe) breathe life into Stillwater, while Kate Hudson absolutely sparkles as Penny Lane.  And Hoffman takes the small role of Lester Bangs and imbues him with such spirit and nuance that his presence is felt throughout the entire film, as is Elaine, thanks to the tremendous talent of McDormand.  Rounding out the terrific supporting cast are Anna Paquin (Polexia), Fairuza Balk (Sapphire), Terry Chen (Ben Fong-Torres) and Zooey Deschanel (Anita Miller).  "Almost Famous" is, in the end, a stirring, thoroughly enjoyable experience; there's great music and some madness, and some real lessons about life in the real world to be learned along the way.  It's a film with wide appeal and something in it for everyone; and if you've ever listened to a record or heard a song, believe me, this is one movie you're going to want to see.</p></body></html>

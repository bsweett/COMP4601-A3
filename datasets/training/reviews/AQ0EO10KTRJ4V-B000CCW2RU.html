<meta name="summary" content="One island that is not a viewers paradise"></head><body><p>Think of a blend between LOGANS RUN and THE SIXTH DAY... but not as good.<br /><br />About 70 minutes into this movie my wife and I looked at each other and said.. "Had enough yet ?"<br /><br />The eject button was our next move.<br /><br />Even without watching the whole film it just seemed like one of those "clones learn their true identity and develop their own individual will to live and try to break free to release their fellow clones"..yadda...yadda...yadda....<br /><br />I SHOULD have liked this film, I'm a sci-fi buff and have even liked Bay's other work...... but this one just FELT like one of those bad 1970s sci-fi flicks like Soylent Green or Omega Man (a weak remake of the classic Vincent Price film)<br /><br />I did not check the box office results for this film, but I think it came and went pretty much un-noticed too</p></body></html>

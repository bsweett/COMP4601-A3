From likable outings like Minority Report to Munich to sort-of-okay ones such as A.I and The Terminal. Catch Me If You Can, a film similar in tone to the Terminal is a bit more accessible and it's interesting all the way through. But interesting doesn't mean great through and through and the film suffers from what I call a "perfectly too long script" where the film can't really be cut down but you wish it had been.<br /><br />The film centers on real-life con artist Frank Abagnale Jr. who successfully impersonated an Airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer and receiving the checks priviledged to such prestigious careers. Of course people aren't too happy and on the case is FBI man Carl Hanratty, an expert on bank fraud. But there's more to Frank than just writing bad checks as he has some family issues that he needs to have taken care of and the desire to keep running.<br /><br />This is kind of a hard Spielberg film to like because it's more a sum-of-its-parts kind of film than looking at individual achievements. All his films, from E.T to Close Encounters to Jaws and Jurassic Park always had some memorable image or a musical theme or something. In this case, it's more acting that shines through. From Leonardo DiCaprio bringing in a great turn as Frank to the one who should've gotten the Oscar, Christopher Walken. Only real problem is Frank's chaser, Hanratty played by Tom Hanks. He plays it with an awful accent and at times you can't even tell what kind of character he's supposed to be.<br /><br />Where the film doesn't really fail but just sort of stumbles is in its pace. This is a film where looking back it's hard to tell what could be cut since a lot of it is important to establishing characters and motivations yet it just feels too long, like a movie you want to trim down but you wouldn't even know where to start. But tonally the film feels just right from its almost sugary atmosphere to the chase music. It's nice to see John Williams NOT to something that sounds like Star Wars all the time). It's not even close to being Spielberg's worst (look to 1941 for that) but not really Spielberg's best but it's still a nice little movie.<br /><br />If you're expecting another classic, look elsewhere. But if you just want something entertaining now and then, can't go wrong here.</p></body></html>

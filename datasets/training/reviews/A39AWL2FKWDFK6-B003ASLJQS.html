<meta name="summary" content="A depressing reunion - should be 4 1/2 stars"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood does a superlative job in directing an extremely fine cast in his gloomy, foreboding portrayal of Dennis Lehane's poignant novel.  <p>Three boyhood friends, Jimmy, Sean and Dave who grew up in a lower middle class Boston neighborhood reunite due to the apparent murder of one of their children.  The boys have taken separate and divergent paths since one of them was abducted and molested many years ago.  Sean Penn is superb playing Jimmy Markham, a reformed ex-con whose daughter was murdered.  The murder investigation is headed by Trooper Sean Devine played by Kevin Bacon and his partner Laurence Fishburn.  Tim Robbins does a creditable job in his portrayal of Dave Boyle, a married working stiff tormented by internal demons as a result of his abduction.<br />Both Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden give convincing performances as Penn and Robbins's respective wives.<p>In one scene when Penn learns that his daughter is actually the murder victim, he goes off the deep end.  This awesome scene is reminiscent of James Cagney going ballistic in White Heat, one of the most classic scenes in cinema history.<p>The appearance of Eli Wallach, one of the most accomplished  character actors of all time, as the liquor store owner was a terrific reunion with Eastwood (not since The Good, The Bad and The Ugly).</p></body></html>

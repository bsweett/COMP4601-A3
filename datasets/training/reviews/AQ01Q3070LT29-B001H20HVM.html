<meta name="summary" content="Can you find the key in SAW II?"></head><body><p>Running Time: 92 mins.<br /> You should see the first film, SAW (2004), first to understand this second film, however, SAW II (2005) is a great movie to start with too.<br /> Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Dina Meyer return.<br /> This sequel is an excellent companion piece to the first movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EWBKLC">Saw [Blu-ray</a>] (2004), and I will not reveal any of the twists and surprises in this movie, but it is another mind blower. In my opinion, SAW II is the best in the film series.<br />  At the opening of the Twisted Pictures production, we see Michael (Noam Jenkins) wearing an opened iron face mask contraption and he must obey the order of the Jigsaw Killer.  He has only a small amount of time to find the key that will set him free and alive. If he doesn't "retrieve" the key, the iron mask will close on his face and kill him.<br />  Cop, Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) must bail out his son, Daniel (Erik Knudsen) from jail. He is tired of dealing with his son's behavior and is so stressed out, he wants him to live somewhere else. Matthews must answer to a call of a homicide. The Jigsaw Killer has struck again. He comes face to face with the Jigsaw Killer (Tobin Bell) and Matthews and his team find themselves under timed pressure.<br />  Eight people (Shawnee Smith, Franky G., Erik Knudsen, Emmanuell Vaugier, Beverley Mitchell, Glenn Plummer, Timothy Burd, Tony Nappo) are locked in a room somewhere in town. They must find them because Matthew's son is also trapped in that room and time is running out.<br /><br />  That is just the start of this film. Memorable, shocking scenes you will never forget.<br /> Donnie Wahlberg and Franky G. really are interesting in this film.  They both give strong performances.<br /><br /> I wonder if this role by Donnie Wahlberg helped him get noticed for the role of "Danny Reagan" in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UD7JC6">Blue Bloods: The First Season</a> tv series.<br /><br /> Producer, Gregg Hoffman died December 4, 2005. Age: 42. He was admitted to the hospital complaining of neck pain. He died of natural causes.<br /><br /> Full Screen Rated "R" DVD edition includes informative audio commentary with Director Darren Lynn Bausman and actor Donnie Wahlberg. It can be found in "Set-Up".<br />  Featurettes will show you how all traps were created including the oven and hypodermic needles trap.<br /><br /> The DVD container is wrapped in tight plastic, but be careful, there is also a protective see-through cover slip that lifts off that you need to save. Notice the security seals on your container. You will have to peel these or cut them to open the container. I like to leave my seals intact. The DVD itself looks like a saw blade with Jigsaw's face on it.<br /><br /> Followed by:<br />  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LPR9ZS">Saw III (Unrated Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] (2006).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001053038">Saw IV [Blu-ray</a>] (2007).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LPWGC8">Saw V - 2 Disc Director's Cut [Blu-ray</a>] (2008).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00275EHGE">Saw VI [Blu-ray</a>] (2009).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Q6D282">Saw: The Final Chapter (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) (Formerly Saw 3D)</a> (2010).<br /><br /> Update: December 2011.

<meta name="summary" content="OK but I liked Heston's "Dark City" better"></head><body><p>This film noir suspenser is an OK way to spend an evening but won't be filed in many people's list of great detective films. The story involves a guy whose memory seems a-twitter who is obviously the pawn of aliens. Sounds goofy? It is.<br /><br />There is some stylish production values in the oddball city where it is always night and rainy, and there are many famous actors in the starry cast.<br /><br />However, I liked Charlton Heston's first film, "Dark City", from 1950 much more than this one. I doubt the two were related in any significant way other than having the same title since Heston's movie, his first starring role, was about the underworld, as I recall.<br /><br />In any event, this movie is an OK night with the DVD player.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the Better Stephen King Page to Screen tales."></head><body><p>Secret Window is a film based on a Stephen King Short Story Secret Window, Secret Garden.  Originally, I had read the short story several years ago and was apprehensive about seeing the film, because my memory of the short story was that the twist ending was somewhat difficult to comprehend.<br /><br />However, seeing this adaptation of it was a godsend in helping me appreciate a really good story.  Depp is perfectly cast as the Author who is being terrorized by a man known only as John Shooter, who accuses Depp of Plaigerizing.  Meanwhile, Rainey is dealing with his own demons as well as he works through a divorce he didn't want.  Depp proves he is one of our most prized acting resources as he tries to stay one step ahead of the madman.<br /><br />However, I would add that I found reading the short story with this book was a great help.  The film stayed true to the creepy ending, and actually helped clear some of my confusion regarding the original reading.  And the filmmakers wisely don't veer too far off course in translating this sad tale of lonliness to the screen.<br /><br />Definitely a great buy if you like thrillers, King, or Depp.</p></body></html>

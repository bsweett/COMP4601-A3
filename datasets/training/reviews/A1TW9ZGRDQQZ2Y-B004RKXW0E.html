<meta name="summary" content="The Toys are back in town"></head><body><p>I have seen 22 movies in theaters so far this year, but out of that bunch, only Toy Story 3 deserves a 5 star rating. Yeah, it's really been a lackluster year.<br /><br />The animation and voice acting are top notch as always, but Pixar never fails in the most important part of a movie, the script. Sure a movie can look pretty and all, but it's the writing that has always elevated Pixar above other animation studios. How to Train Your Dragon was a very good effort from Dreamworks this year, but watching Toy Story 3 today just confirmed how far they still have to go.<br /><br />I will agree with the claim that most critics are making by saying that this is one of the best movie trilogies of all time. Other than the first three films of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Lord of the Rings, I can't think of any others more consistently great. Toy Story 3 is just as good as 1 and 2, but it goes into some darker territory than the previous two, so much so, I would say this is geared more for adults than kids. Don't let that fool you, there are more than enough clever lines and visual gags to keep you laughting, as well as, some great action sequences. I loved the whole prison break out of the daycare part, and the last five minutes or so couldn't have been any more perfect, leaving you wiping away happy and sad tears at the same time.<br /><br />In the end, we are left with a beautifully wrapped up conclusion to a series of movies that will be treasured for infinity and beyond.<br /><br />I didn't see the movie in 3-D since I heard it wasn't worth the extra money. Judging from the trailers I saw before the movie started, everyone is rushing to tack on 3-D at the last minute. Only Avatar and How to Train Your Dragon had the impact of actually being filmed that way to begin with.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very good movie"></head><body><p>Rap, Hip Hop, rock. No matter what you like to listen to you will like this movie. I haven't read much about Marshal (Eminem) but I believe this movie is based on his life. I like the kind of person he plays in this movie, a good man just trying to get by like a lot of us these days. While watching the movie I still can't believe Brittany Murphy is dead. I thought she would be around for ever.</p></body></html>

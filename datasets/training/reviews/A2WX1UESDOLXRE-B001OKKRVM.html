<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good, Interesting, Informative"></head><body><p>March of the Penguins is a pretty good flick: Not only is it informative, but it's entertaining and narrated wonderfully by Morgan Freeman. I found it somewhat dull, however, even though I walked away with an admiration for this movie. And I couldn't get my 4 year old cousin to sit through it, even though he loves to see the penguins at the zoo.<br /><br />This movie reminds me alot of an animated film I used to watch when I was a kid called "Scamper the Penguin." It gives all the information that March of the Penguins provides, though with slightly less harsh details and images. And of course, the little penguins in "Scamper" can talk and the girls are pink and the boys are blue. Anyway, March of the Penguins is an endearing documentary about Emperor Penguins, and the instinctual rituals of the males to travel many miles to mate with the females. Then when the egg is laid, the females travel the same distance, though in harsher weather, to feed in the ocean and return with sustenance for the newly born chick. The males don't eat for nearly four months.<br /><br />Certainly, if you love penguins, give this movie a look, maybe even a buy. Like I said, super informative, and those little baby chicks are so cute you'll be "ooing" and "ahhing" the entire time. Though my little cousin couldn't sit through it, other kids just might be able to, and if you're willing to let them see the realities of life, despite how terrible it is, it can be an excellent learning tool. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></body></html>

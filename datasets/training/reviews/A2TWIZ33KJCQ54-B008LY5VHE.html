<meta name="summary" content="ITS HARD TO THINK OF THE OCEAN WITHOUT THINKING OF JAWS - - - -"></head><body><p>- - BECAUSE WE ARE ALL AT RISK OF BEING EATEN ANYTIME WE ARE NEAR SALT WATER!<br /><br />IT BEGINS WHEN -----<br /><br />It begins when a "summer girl" goes for a midnight swim and, after being reported missing, is later discovered on the beach --in pieces. Is it a shark attack, a boating accident, or what? After all, all we saw were a few tugs and screams. But was there something hidden in the water? Or was it as the mayor suggested, a simple drowning followed by a collsion with a boat's propeller for the "summer girl"?<br /><br />BUT THEN ---<br /><br />After a short and sweet coverup by the business-oriented mayor and town council, more swimmers and fisherman get mangled at sea and there are witnesses to some of these slayings, ending the chance of both a continued coverup and a lucrative summer business for Amity Island [flimed at Martha's Vineyard].<br /><br />During the Amity versus Jaws segment, we see more and more of the shark and more graphic depictions of the shark and its dining habits.<br /><br />AH --- BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING ---<br /><br />Then, the second and primary theme develops. Roy Scheider as Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper, a scientist from the "Oceanographic Institute", and Robert Shaw as Captain Quint, an off-the-wall sailor set sail to kill the "Great White" that is turning the water red around the seaside community of Amity Island.<br /><br />YOU AND I ARE AT RISK OF BEING EATEN ANYTIME WE ARE NEAR SALT WATER!<br /><br />This part of the movie is a combination wild buddy adventure and monster movie. However, the basic theme that has induced fear into audiences and all swimmers afterward is pervasive now aboard ship, during the hunt for Jaws. You see, no one sees Jaws until it is too late, if at all. The crew of three now simply wait for something to come up, out of the dark waters below, and literally crash onto their small fishing boat. Therein lies the charm of Jaws -- it can come out without warning and simply tear you or your loved ones to shreds. Even on a boat, a dock, or within shallow, patrolled beaches, we are all at risk of becoming a meal for a monster. When the film is over the risk still remains. If and when we return to the beach at the ocean, we will find ourselves suddenly reminded that we are not at the top of the food chain. This is what makes propaganda so effective, and here it is at its best -- YOU AND I ARE AT RISK OF BEING EATEN ANYTIME WE ARE NEAR SALT WATER! Wherever did we get that idea from?<br /><br />IN THE END: [plot spoilers below]<br /><br />Spielberg gives us a very satisfying end which does differ somewhat from the book. Quint goes the way of Captain Ahab, right into the beast's mouth, still kicking, stabbing, shouting and fighting. Next, as the ship is sinking, Chief Brody, after repeated shots with a rifle does get the oxygen tank to explode in Jaws' mouth for a dramatic end to this bad fish. Afterward, Hooper makes a surprise return from what we assumed was a sure death within a mangled anti-shark cage. The film closes with the two buddies paddling toward the distant shore using two of the floating shark barrels to float on as they kick their way away from the camera and toward home.<br /><br />BUT ITS NEVER REALLY OVER BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT JAWS IS STILL OUT THERE!<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD: [TOP PICK: 30TH ANNIVERSARY WIDESCREEN]<br /><br />There are at least 5 releases on DVD that I know of. In all cases, the film appears about the same, the differences being in the features and whether it is a Widescreen or Full-Frame Format. The last release is the 30th Anniversary Edition which differs from the Anniversary Edition [25th Anniversary in small print] only in the featurettes. One is longer and is touted as being new and improved over the last release. Both Anniversary releases have some deleted scenes. Again, the biggest extra feature on the 30th Anniversary edition is "From The Set: An insider's look at life on the set of Jaws" which features a "never-before-available interview with Steven Spielberg". Okay, that is about the biggest difference, but though I have seen both Anniversary editions, I am staying with the "Anniversary Edition" in Widescreen from 2000. However, if I were now in the market for Jaws on DVD, I would buy the new "30th Anniversary Edition" from 2005.<br /><br />CAST - CREW - AWARDS !!!!<br /><br />----- CAST<br /><br />Roy Scheider - Chief Martin Brody<br /><br />Robert Shaw - Quint<br /><br />Richard Dreyfuss - Matt Hooper<br /><br />Lorraine Gary - Ellen Brody<br /><br />Murray Hamilton - Mayor Larry Vaughn<br /><br />Carl Gottlieb - Editor Meadows<br /><br />----- CREW<br /><br />Steven Spielberg - Director<br /><br />David Brown - Producer<br /><br />Richard D.

<meta name="summary" content="Captivating"></head><body><p>The Illusionist is the story of a young magician in 1900 Vienna.  Eisenheim (Edward Norton) bursts onto the scene and immediately captivates the entire city, gaining a sizable following, which includes the city's Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) and even the Crown Prince himself (played by Rufus Sewell).  However, Uhl eventually finds that he must arrest the magician for crimes against the empire.  Most of the movie is told by Uhl to Prince Leopold concerning his investigation into Eisenheim's life.<br /><br />Uhl's tale of Eisenheim's introduction to magic is an unbelievable tale of a creepy old wizard who imparts his powers onto the young boy, who is the son of a cabinet maker.  Eisenheim's father builds the furniture for the family of a dutchess.  As with many stories, the high class Dutchess Sophie (played as an adult by Jessica Biel) and the peasant Eisenheim fall for each other.  Eisenheim astounds Sophie with his magical skills, but of course, things end in tragedy.  Eisenheim disappears for years, only to return to Vienna as an adult.  Unbeknownst to him, Sophie is set to wed Prince Leopold.  The pair attend one of Eisenheim's shows after reading rave reviews about his act.  Eisenheim wows the audience by spouting philosophy that ties into his illusions.  While contemplating time, he makes a small orange tree grow within the space of 30 seconds and has butterflies carry a handkerchief across the stage.  When he asks for a volunteer who "does not fear death", Leopold volunteers Sophie.  While Eisenheim immediately recognizes Sophie, she does not remember him at first.  However, the pair rekindle their love affair under the nose of the Prince.<br /><br />Meanwhile, both Uhl and Leopold try to figure out the secrets to the illusions.  While Uhl sees it more as a good challenge, Leopold feels insulted that a man of lesser standing can outwit him.  After Eisenheim humiliates Leopold at a private party, the Prince orders Uhl to shut down the magician.<br /><br />What follows are two series of events by both Eisenheim and Uhl to outwit the other.  Eisenheim wants to escape Vienna with Sophie while Uhl needs to find out how his tricks work in order to arrest him for fraud.  Their paths seem to be parallel, but there may actually be a convergence point for the two rivals.<br /><br />The good story is augmented by strong performances from all the actors, especially Norton and Giamatti.  Norton's soft-spoken approach to the brilliant and patient illusionist perfectly compliments the angry and erratic Leopold, who serves as his rival in the love triangle with Sophie in the middle.  Giamatti's take on the police inspector who is divided between his loyalty to the Prince and his quest to pursue justice is very well done.  Biel is good, but is definitely overshadowed by the two male leads.<br /><br />This is film is seeing a limited release, but it is definitely worth seeing.  You may have to go out of your way, but it is worth it.</p></body></html>

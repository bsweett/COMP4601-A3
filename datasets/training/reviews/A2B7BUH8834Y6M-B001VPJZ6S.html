<meta name="summary" content="THE Definitive Gen X Movie of All Time"></head><body><p>If you graduated from high school in the 1980s and haven't seen this film, you must have been locked in a cave.<p>John Hughes delivers the definitive nostalgic teen movie of the Generation X crowd. The cast made up the '80s &quot;brat pack&quot; with Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Molly  Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. It's hard to believe while seeing this  film that Ringwald and Hall were the only real high school aged  performers... the others were in their mid to late 20s during  filming.<p>While modern teens may not find this as  &quot;sophisticated&quot; as over-sexed comedies like &quot;American  Pie,&quot; anyone can appreciate true feelings, teen angst, self doubt and  relationships with parents portrayed in this film.<p>A group of kids  sitting for 8 hours in detention on a Saturday none of them will ever  forget. While there is foul language, it's about the same speed as what you  can hear on &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; on TV. There is no nudity or sex, just  raw, in your face teen angst.<p>You see this group of &quot;losers,&quot;  warts and all, and become friends with all of them before the film is over.  The DVD doesn't offer anything other than cast bios and subtitles... which  is a disappointment. It would have been great to have had some interviews  with the cast and behind the scenes footage.  Nonetheless, DVD is much  better than tape and definitely worth the extra $ for a non volitile  format.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Completely idiotic, and completely enjoyable"></head><body><p>If the first Transporter film was a moderate guilty pleasure, then it's sequel is a bona-fide one at that.  Jason Statham returns as Frank Martin, an expert driver who is on a different sort of job these days.  As a favor, he's escorting the son of a wealthy couple (Matthew Modine, Amber Valletta) who soon becomes the target of a supplier (Alessandro Gassman) who has a dangerous virus at his disposal.  Transporter 2 features even less character development this time around, not to mention even more unbelievable physics and some ridiculous action scenes involving Frank and his car to boot.  Not to mention a female assassin (Kate Nauta) who frequently works in her bra and panties.  Yeah, but despite what all the film has going against it, Transporter 2 manages to be enjoyable throughout it's running time even though a majority of it is completely idiotic.  This is because of Statham's scowly charisma, as well as the fact that nothing about this film is taken seriously.  All in all, if you enjoyed the first film, chances are that you'll probably dig this.</p></body></html>

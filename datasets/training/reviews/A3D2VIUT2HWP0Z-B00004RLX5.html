<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant, Superb, Great Entertainment"></head><body><p>Two Discs packed with entertainment information, and an extremely good time.<br />Nicholas Meyer wrote part of this Film, and despite that short coming, :-), it is great; you get to discover which parts he wrote too !!! And surprise, surprise, both Meyer and Shatner  agree on one thing, the use of Time Travel as a device is not that great. However, its very good fun in this film.<br />Nimoy once again shows his brilliance as a director in what I believe is his third directorship, and maybe fourth( but not in thje STAR TREK Universe). He correctly picks some significant changes in the stories edge, and manages to safely create one of the most popular films in the STAR TREK film series.<br />The features on disc 2 are brilliant, and the detailed Tribute to Mark Lenard  is awesome !!! Some of the discussions may be a bit too much for some, but the loads of extras is more than enough to justify the cost, even with the disc one audio and video quality, as well as a DVD  menu that is way better than STAR TREK VI ( the only  other one in this series I have seen so far), the icing is on the cake.</p></body></html>

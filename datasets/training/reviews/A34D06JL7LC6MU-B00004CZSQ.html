<meta name="summary" content="Not Argento's Masterpiece, But An Impressive Effort of Any Genre"></head><body><p>Dario Argento's Suspiria has been called the horror auteur's best film, alongside <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KRNG4U">Deep Red</a>. The first film in his "Three Mothers" trilogy and the last film to be processed in Technicolor, Suspiria showed Argento moving in a slightly different direction from the giallo subgenre. Suspiria is not a murder mystery nor is it technically a giallo, although many of the defining elements are present. Suspiria is more supernatural than any of his previous films and includes one of his most legendary death scenes.<br /><br />Filmed in English, the film stars Jessica Harper as Suzy Banyon, an American who leaves New York to attend a prestigious ballet school in Germany. When Suzy arrives, she sees a young girl fleeing the school and Suzy herself is denied entry into the school. After Suzy leaves, the girl returns only to be brutally murdered in one of the most lauded death scenes ever filmed. It deserves the praise, as it's well-staged, well-shot, and quite memorable. Once Suzy returns the academy she meets Miss Tanner (Alida Valli), one of the instructors and Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett), the headmistress. There's talk of a mysterious directress who's apparently "traveling abroad." As bizarre events occur (a seeing eye dog attacking people, maggot infestation, etc.) and bodies pile up, Suzy finds that something more sinister may be happening at the school.<br /><br />Suspiria is a slow build, despite that first death scene occurring only a few minutes into the film. I didn't find the film boring, but I could see why some viewer's do. The pace does lag and it doesn't jump right into the "mystery" of the story like Deep Red did in its opening scene. Argento co-wrote the script with his then-girlfriend and Deep Red star Daria Nicolodi. The script, apparently based on "true" stories told to Nicolodi by her grandmother, is possibly the weakest element of the film, with tacky dialogue marred even further by unconvincing delivery. With lines like "I once read that names which begin with the letter `s' are the names of snakes (hiss)," the actors can hardly be blamed for not sounding thrilled.<br /><br />On that note; many of the European actors weren't comfortable with the English language and their lines were dubbed. The dubbing is noticeable, but as annoying as it could be due to Argento's stylistic ability.<br /><br />Suspiria does have masterful set design and cinematography. The sets (the school in particular) are wonderful. The school is beautifully colored and exquisitely crafted, looking more like an elaborate painting than movie architecture. The cinematography by Luciano Tovoli is splendid and rather complicated. Tovoli works with constantly changing light and effortlessly makes the colors onscreen seem either vibrant or frightening.<br /><br />Goblin, with the assistant of Argento, delivers a brilliantly creepy musical score that compliments each scene and has become almost as famous as the film itself.<br /><br />Despite all these brilliant qualities the film has, I didn't fall in love with it the way I fell in love with previous Argento efforts. It's commonly called Argento's masterpiece and a masterpiece of horror cinema, but it's got those who've seen it pretty divided...I think this is due to the script. People who like their horror quick and to the point will find things they like here, but the film does plod along. Those who call it a masterpiece and are devout lovers of this film likely factor the film's style and creativity into their opinion. Suspiria is a well made film of any genre and, as a horror film, it is a masterpiece. It's got creative, memorable, and suspenseful death scenes and, unlike most horror films, it's made by people who know what they're doing but the plot lacks a central hook and didn't draw me in completely.<br /><br />I won't remember the film for its plot, but for its style and imagery. Argento clearly possesses such a visual creativity he could've easily worked outside the horror genre and joined the ranks of Italian filmmakers like Fellini and Antonioni. Since Argento found his calling in this genre, he did provide audiences with some of the best examples of horror filmmaking out there. Suspiria does prove, even more so than Deep Red did, that horror can be both beautiful and scary...It can be art. I don't believe Suspiria is Argento's masterpiece, but it should satisfy many horror fans and certainly fans of Argento. It really is an impressive effort of any genre.<br /><br />GRADE: B<br /><br />NOTE-The lack of subtitles on the DVD is maddening, as some of the dialogue (especially when whispered) is difficult to understand at times.</p></body></html>

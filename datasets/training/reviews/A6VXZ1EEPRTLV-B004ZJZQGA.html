<meta name="summary" content="a dark crime thriller that sneaks up on you..."></head><body><p>Writer/director Martin McDonagh takes some time setting the scene and developing his characters, before he reveals that his film In Bruges (2008) is not about an offbeat vacation trip, but is actually a grim crime thriller, with a wicked sense of humor.  Spoilers follow.<br /><br />Englishmen Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) arrive in Burges, Belgium, check into a hotel, and begin seeing the many sights in the historic city.  A movie is being filmed in the town, and Ray hooks up with Chloe (Clemence Poesy) a production assistant.  While Ray is on a date with Chloe, Ken receives a phone call from his boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes) living in England, directing him to kill Ray the following day.<br /><br />Ken and Ray are hit men.  Ray has just successfully completed his first assignment, the murder of a priest.  Unfortunately since he also accidentally killed a young boy, Waters has decided that Ray must be eliminated.  Ray has been keeping busy, punching out a couple in a restaurant, and when Chloe turns out to be a drug dealer, he shoots her criminal associate Erik (Jeremie Renier) in the eye.  After scoring some drugs in Chloe's place, the night finishes with Ray and Ken, partying with Jimmy (Jordan Prentice) a dwarf actor working on the film.<br /><br />The following day, Ken reluctantly  secures a gun, but instead of executing Ray, he puts him aboard a train out of town.  Harry is mad enough to kill when Ken tells him what he has done, and comes to Bruges to handle the situation himself.  Things almost conclude without too much damage, but soon shots ring out in the quiet night, and the streets become stained with blood, in this offbeat crime thriller.<br /><br />An Academy Award winner for his short Six Shooter (2006), Martin McDonagh was also nominated for an Academy Award for his original screenplay for In Bruges.  With well developed characters, most of whom are far from admirable, the film has a certain earthy realism, to go along with a very dark British sense of humor.  In his feature film debut, McDonagh demonstrates a flair for drama, and an eye for detail.  Projectiles are a point of focus, as people die and a man loses an eye.  With Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes leading the way, the acting performances are solid all across the board.<br /><br />McDonagh features a number of twists that keep the story engaging, but when an innocent child is murdered, the odds are not good that things will turn out well.  Trouble is eminent when Harry arrives, but the violence still comes at a surprisingly odd angle.  Shot on location in Bruges, the film nicely captures some sense of the place, in what is a dark, offbeat, and at times brutal crime thriller with some unique characters.</p></body></html>

This one has a series of stories, some of them related and most of them with John Travolta.  One of my favorites involves Travolta and Samuel L Jackson who shoot a guy in their car.  They need to clean themselves up and get rid of the "mess."  Enter Harvey Keitel as a take charge kind of guy who approaches the problem like a swat team giving everybody orders of what to do, how to do it, and how long each step will take.<br /><br />Another tale involves Bruce Willis trying to guard a watch that was handed down from his grandfather to his father and then preserved by his father's friend (Christopher Walken) in his rectum during internment at a POW camp.  Willis trying to get the watch back gets into a big fight with a crime boss and while they are fighting they are captured by sex fiends for torturous games.<br /><br />The movie breaks all rules and like Blue Velvet, is like no other movie I have seen before.  I have seen the movie 4 times and seem to pick up something new about it each time I see it.</p></body></html>

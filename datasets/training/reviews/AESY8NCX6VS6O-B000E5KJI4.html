<meta name="summary" content="Unbelievably stupid - one of the worst epics ever made"></head><body><p>The whole Iliad deal is kind of an acquired taste. We get it shoved down our throats in high school, forced to read hastily assembled excerpts in literature books, get told it's a hugely important historical document, and then move on to Romeo and Juliet and The Catcher in the Rye. I somewhat had the same "oh-please-God-not-again" feeling toward the Iliad when I had to read it again for a Humanities class this past fall quarter, but I have to say that not only did I gain a new understanding of it, but a new respect of it. What that old, blind poet of old sang to the Greeks is truly transcendent - the anger, the honor, the forgiveness, the humility of it all. So why does Wolfgang Petersen&#8217;s Troy completely throw everything decent about its source material right out the window?<p>  Take your seats for two hours and forty-three excruciatingly boring moments and watch one of the most enduring works of mortal creativity get sodomized like there's no freaking tomorrow. And unfortunately, that's pretty much the impression that you'll be getting right off the bat. Petersen's bloated, simperingly stupid film doesn't even put up any pretence of trying to make a stand-alone work that honors its source material in any way - it launches into the fight scenes, the awkward dialogue, and the wooden acting right away. <p>  It's not just Pitt, who is horrifically miscast here, or Orlando Bloom (obviously just a way to reel in LOTR fans), or Cox, or Sean Bean (wasn't he in LOTR too?), or poor, poor Peter O'Toole (I hope he got paid a lot for this) - it's David Benioff's script at the heart of the problem. Nearly every character, in the onset of the film, makes some reference to the fact that the ensuing action will be remembered for thousands of years. This pretty much stops the movie dead in its tracks (which is sad, because there's a whole two more hours to endure by then), for it's a desperate attempt to inform the audience that just because it's based off of Homer, it's automatically supposed to be grand and heroic. Homer's epic was fascinating because the characters felt like real people, with real personal struggles and real motivations. This movie...well, forget it. I'm not even gonna get into how much it ravages the source material - you get my idea.<p>  And don't even get me started on the fight scenes. Petersen stages every single battle with the same exact tone - men getting killed left and right didn't solicit a raised eyebrow, a wince, or even a muscle movement from me. The men fighting and dying for Greece and Troy are no-name bodies that charge forward with copious digital assistance. And the ones with names are even more of a problem.<p>  As I said before, the dialogue is laughably horrible, but none of it is manifested to more of a disgusting effect than with Brad Pitt as Achilles. This is, without a doubt, one of the single worst performances I have ever seen in a movie. He can't find an accent, every word comes through with the same defiant tone - if this guy can act, he certainly isn't proving his case here. It's quite clear deep into the movie that the Homerian epic was merely a little side issue that Benioff and Petersen needed to inserted. The real motive of this movie is to get a bunch of attractive men together and show them off for unfortunate audience members that will sadly sit through this.<p>  If you're not throwing up profusely by about hour two, just wait until a melodramatic love story involving Achilles gets thrown into the mix. I have to admit, I never liked the movie, but getting into the final stretch, I simply became angry. This is one of the biggest wastes of money, talent, and ambition I have ever seen. Troy goes on and on and on and on, doesn't even stop where the original Iliad does (because, of course, it's not about the Iliad, it's about Brad Pitt), and is so fatally overlong I nearly cried. There are only three minutes or so of this movie that actually work, and they are when Peter O'Toole, as Priam, visits Achilles near the end of the film to demand something (I won't go into specifics, but I imagine most of you know the deal). A stunningly accomplished actor wasted for most of the movie, he gets to knock it out of the park briefly as he begs on his knees before Pitt's Achilles. By this time, I was so angry at the movie that every time Pitt's face hit the screen I just closed my eyes - it's obvious that this isn't Priam just begging to Achilles for a deserved possession back. This is Peter O'Toole, freaking LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, imploring Brad Pitt as to why the heck he's in such a mess.<p>  I simply can't even begin to tell you how much I hated this movie. While watching it, I suddenly longed for even mediocre epics, like Braveheart. I wanted to see the complexity of Lawrence of Arabia, the stunning acting of Gladiator, the perfectly tuned campiness of The Ten Commandments - things this movie lacks to an embarassing level. You know, there are people out there who are losing their faith in the future of the movies, and after watching Troy, I can realize that they may have something. This complete trainwreck, one of the worst I've ever seen, wasted not only money that could have been spent on something else, but nearly three hours of my time, and I am SO angry. I want to remind director Wolfgang Petersen that maybe he should listen to things that the characters say in his movie. For example, when the Trojan Horse is introduced about 2 hours and 30 minutes into this bile-bucket, Paris says, "Burn it." Oh, if only. GRADE: F</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Suspense, tension and good technology.  But silly story."></head><body><p>Nominated for several Academy Awards, this 1959 film by Alfred Hitchcock lives in my memory because of several memorable scenes.  There's a scene where Cary Grant is being chased by an crop duster airplane.  And then there's another scene where killers are chasing Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint on Mount Rushmore.  I remember Cary Grant being suave.  And I remember Eva Marie Saint as being beautiful.<p>Forty-three years have passed since then.  It's time to take another look at this classic. <p>Well, Cary Grant is still suave.  Eva Marie Saint is still beautiful.  The two memorable scenes are still tense with action.  And the Hitchcock style of suspense is there too.<p>But it's no wonder I don't remember the plot, which revolves around Cary Grant being mistaken for an international spy, Eva Marie Saint being a double agent and James Mason and Martin Landau being the bad guys.  That's because, like some of today's technological wonders, the plot is an afterthought, pulled together for the purpose of showing off the &quot;good scenes&quot;.  <p>My opinion on this was borne out by the special features on the DVD, which described the making of the film.  The action scenes were thought up first, and then the story was fitted around them.<p>O.K.  The film is a classic and will remain so no matter what I say.  And memories of those several scenes will live long into the future.<p>But I yearn for a story I can sink my teeth into.  I want to care about the characters.  I want to believe that the action they are going through is possible.  I feel this about films of today.  And I feel this about North By Northwest.  <p>High-tech aficionados will enjoy this flick as a great achievement for Hitchcock given the era he worked in.  I can appreciate it for its historical significance, but certainly not for anything else.  I therefore can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.</p></body></html>

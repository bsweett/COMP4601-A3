<meta name="summary" content="Big Fish is a tale thats as large as life itself"></head><body><p>Big Fish is one of Tim Burton's films that doesn't leave you depressed and struggling to find a dry hanky. What it will leave you with is a feel-good feeling while you'll be searching for a clean hanky.<br /><br />Better known for his oddly different movies such as Edward scissorhands, and sleepy hollow, Tim Burton has constructed a movie that seems impossibly fairy-tale like in its intense beauty of story telling and lush settings, while still keeping the draber side of the story (reality) enthralling.<br /><br />Williem Bloom (Billy Crudup) is a man who grew up with his storytelling father, (Albert Finney, Ewan McGregor) who always seemed to have wonderful exciting things happening to him. Even if they seemed to wild to believe, Edward manages to make them truly real. However children cannot stay young always, and finally Will grows up to despise his fathers storys, believing its the lies of a man who is has been discontent with his life and family. Lies he has invented to soothe himself that his life didn't turn out the particulare way he wanted. The people he has met, the things he has done never happened, only in his imagination that is. People alive only in the reality of his father dillusional mind<br /><br />Unable to listen to his father any longer, he tells him that he justs wants to know the real him. "But I've told you!" Edward replies, " You just haven't been listening." So begins the journey through the fantastic mind of one man who believed the world was designed to be lived to  the fullest. He was the master of his destiny and death was just yet another adventure to be looked forward to.<br /><br />The end is the best part of the fairy tale, when Edward is dying and tells William to tell how he dies. Coming from a man who has spent his life polishing his life up, it is his son's turn to follow his footsteps. Follow Will does, turning his fathers death into one of the most touching part of all the previous stories told. Even in the realm of fantasy there is reality, which is proven by his fathers actual funeral when mostly all of what the son has told his father happens in the reality realm. Not as colorful of fantastic, but just as wonderful.<br /><br />Tim Burton strikes again, with yet another movie that will leave feeling as though life is truly as beautiful as portrayed here. One must only be ready to open their eyes to the truth</p></body></html>

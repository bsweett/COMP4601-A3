<meta name="summary" content="Her Childhood Memories"></head><body><p>The film begins with a child opening a box with toys that dates this story to the 1930s. The lawyer takes his payment in goods, cash is scarce. This little girl seems to be a tomboy. The kids are warned about the local maniac chained in his house. There is an old lady who is cranky. We hear the family history. People don't dress for the hot weather. The Judge asks Atticus Finch to represent a defendant. These kids just wander around (to present a view of life). Does anyone watch them? That lady does not wear a hat and gloves. "Scout" seems to have a behavior problem. Atticus tells about his first gun. He tells "Scout" about the need for proper deportment in school.<br /><br />Then a mad dog appears in the street. Atticus returns to shoot it, he is known as a good shot. Later he meets the wife of the defendant. A man shows up for a scary scene. Jem finds a trinket. "Scout" has more behavior problems. Atticus explains his legal work. A man patches a hole in a tree. Jem found things in that hole. At night some cars arrive at the jail. Atticus bars the door, he defends it with moral strength. His daughter's presence turns the men back. [Believable?] The courtroom is packed solid, but there is room on the second floor. The trial begins with testimony from Sheriff Tait. Mr. Ewell tells what he saw. Lawyer Finch shows Ewell is left-handed. May Ellen testifies about what happened. Finch questions her.<br /><br />Defendant Robinson tells how his left arm was lamed due to an accident on the job when he was twelve years old. [No child labor laws?] May Ellen repeats her claim. [You can judge her credibility.] Mr Robinson takes the stand and tells what happened. Will he be believed? He felt sorry for her? Lawyer Finch said there was no physical evidence for the crime. The defendant has a lame left arm. Was this crime due to the violation of society's rules. Can the word of a Negro be taken against two white people? Finch asks for justice for his client. The jury takes two hours to decide on guilty. Later Finch learns that Robinson was shot while trying to escape.<br /><br />Jem and Tina May walk home in the dark for a final dramatic scene. They are attacked by a strange man. Jem is hurt. Mr. Ewell is found dead. Who rescued Jem? [Is the ending believable?] Sheriff Tait decides that Ewell fell on his knife. This case is closed. An example of poetic justice? [Would Atticus want his child to be friends with a grown man who has emotional problems? This ending damages the story.] I wonder if "Scout" will have problems as an adult?</p></body></html>

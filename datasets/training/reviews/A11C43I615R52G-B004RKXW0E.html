<meta name="summary" content="Pixar does it again and with a second sequel no less."></head><body><p>Watching TS3 the day it premiered, I realized that Pixar has become the greatest movie studio of all time. Don't get me wrong, I always considered it one of the best but I want it to see how they will manage a second sequel of a beloved franchise? Well, they manage it brilliantly and TS3 has become a crowning achievement in Pixar's great catalogue. So far has been 11/11. Perfect in every way.<br /><br />TS3 reunites us with our favorites toys and they haven't age one day. But in reality Andy has and now they face a grim prospect of being neglected or worse, destroyed. I won't give any plot detalis but let me tell you that this movie make me cry. And I never cry in a picture. Never!! Not even in Up in that wonderful beginning, but TS3 did it. The ending is bittersweet and beautiful at the same time. Needless to say the animation is superb, the cast is awesome and the story is excellent. I feel sorry for How to Train Your Dragon because it is a terrific film but can't compare to TS3. It's 2010 best film . Thank you Pixar and thank you Woody, Buzz and the others for once again making us live a wonderful experience. Congratulations.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br /><br />Now released on Blu-Ray, TS3 is nothing short of fantastic in this set. Picture is completely demo-quality with vibrant colors, sharo detail and lush animation. An amazing transfer.<br /><br />Likewise, the 7.1 DTS-HD MA will rock your house. It envelops you and completely blows you away with the level of clarity that it has.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />This is a 2-Disc BD set that is choked full of bonus material. First you got the delightful theatrical short "Day & Night", you got a PIP commenatry with the director and the producer, a trivia game, a Paths to Pixar featurette that this time feature Editors, a cast reunion, a how to write a screenplay with Michael Arndt, Studio stories, Trailers and much much more. All the features are excellent and will leave you completely satisfied.<br /><br />This set also contains a DVD and a Digital Copy.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts:<br /><br />TS3 is a crowning achievement for Pixar. Where more franchises will fail, Pixar has succeeded triumphantly and this third entry in the TS series is an instant classic. This set is a must own. Completely recommended!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A dramatic and engaging film"></head><body><p>A young Scottish doctor longs for adventure so he spins a globe and decides he'll close his eyes and point to the place where he will go.  His finger falls upon Uganda and his fate is sealed.  At first he works at a clinic, but then his path crosses that of dictator Idi Amin and his life becomes inexorably intertwined with that of the Ugandan ruler as he becomes his personal physician.  The movie is dramatic and fast-moving and the performance of Forest Whitaker as Amin is truly memorable.  Fiction though it may be, the film is very entertaining and it does give the viewer a look at the havoc that one man can cause when given absolute power.</p></body></html>

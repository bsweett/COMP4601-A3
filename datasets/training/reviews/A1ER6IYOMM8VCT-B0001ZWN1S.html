<meta name="summary" content="THE BEST FILM OF ALL TIME! NEW BLU RAY IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS!"></head><body><p>The Godfather is one of those rare times where everything works perfectly. It is in fact the best movie ever made and at at the very least the best mob movie ever made(Followed closely by The Godfather part 2). Instead of bludgeoning us with shoot outs and bloody deaths, Coppola weaves a character study about a family. Being Italian American myself, I can tell you this is the most accurate portrayal of an Italian American family I have ever seen on screen! Of course there is violence and when it comes it comes on strong, but the heart of this film is in the performances of every person in this film!<br /><br />First rate performances throughout and every attention to detail is impeccable. One of the most amazing performances is Marlon Brando's Don. He isn't on screen very long, but leaves us with one of the most unforgettable and powerful characters in the history of film. The films runs almost three hours, but when it ends you will be craving more. It's just a fascinating film and I can not think of any other film that I have watched more in my life. The DVD transfer is OK, but the new 2009 Blu Ray is the way to go, it's as good as these films will ever look and the new Godfather Blu Ray box set is an essential purchase!</p></body></html>

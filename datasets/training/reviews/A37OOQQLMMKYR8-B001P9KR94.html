Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- November 12th, 2008<br /><br />Running Time- 121-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Screenplay- Simon Beaufoy<br /><br />Director- Danny Boyle<br /><br />Starring- Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Rubiana Ali, Tanay Chheda, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar, Madhur Mittal<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire took the film world by storm and won several Oscars, with major ones for best adapted screenplay, best director and the big one best picture. Slumdog Millionaire is the little movie that I'm sure not many expected to become the blockbuster hit it was and of course winning all the Oscars it did. There's a lot of hype on Slumdog and the good news is due to that people will see it; the downside is there's bound to be some backlash. What many people though are wondering does Slumdog Millionaire live up to all the hype? The answer is yes and no.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire is a great flick for sure and I would rate the movie as one of my favorites of 2008, but personally I don't think Slumdog is best picture good. I thought the movie was good enough, but there were some other movies I thought were a bit better and some weren't nominated, but despite that Slumdog Millionaire is a great flick and worthy of the praise, but don't get caught up too much with the hype because than you'll be bound to be disappointed. A lot of people have compared Slumdog Millionaire to Rocky due to the underdog vibe both movies have and that's where the strength of Slumdog comes from. Everybody loves an underdog story and I'm sure that in part is what helped Slumdog dominate the Oscars.<br /><br />The screenplay by Simon Beaufoy is very well written and the characters are rock solid; the main character is Jamal and we follow him through his life played by three different actors and I really liked the concept of that and I think that's what makes this movie so likeable to you follow the character around and see the tough life he has and it brings sympathy to him. Slumdog is sort of that movie that as you watch it you get more and more invested in the lives of these characters and any possible flaws you can find are more than made up for due to that.<br /><br />Danny Boyle has been a director who has had a nice following, but here with Slumdog Millionaire he's now a major player in Hollywood. Boyle does a great job with Slumdog and all the praise he's gotten for the movie is more than deserving; the pacing of Slumdog is excellent and the movie is always moving forward with the plot or characters. Boyle manages to grab the viewers' attention from the start and always keeps you invested in the life of Jamal and the other characters. Danny Boyle creates some truly deep and touching scenes and is able to really bring out a lot of different emotions while you watch the movie.<br /><br />The acting is solid from pretty much all the cast members and Dev Patel and Freida Pinto are both talents to watch for in the future. The character of Jamal played Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and then by Dev Patel is a truly great character that you can get behind and root for and all three actors are excellent.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire is a great movie, but what elevates the movie is how we follow Jamal through different times in his life and that's what will hook the viewer and make us so invested in his life and how it will all turn out. Again Slumdog Millionaire is worthy of the praise it has gotten and worthy of it's best picture win even if it wouldn't be my top pick, but I highly recommend this movie. It's destined to become a classic.</p></body></html>

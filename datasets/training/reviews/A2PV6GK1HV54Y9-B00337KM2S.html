Clooney is one of those actors who never really challenges himself but his role in this film is quite good and surprising. His love interest played by the very talented Vera Farmiga really adds depth and there's also a dramatic twist at the end that I never saw coming. Anna Kendrick is also good in this film, her character is very naive in the start but by the end, she becomes a more compassionate and well-rounded person. Up in the Air isn't a perfect film and it's slow in certain parts but overall, I enjoyed it very much!</p></body></html>

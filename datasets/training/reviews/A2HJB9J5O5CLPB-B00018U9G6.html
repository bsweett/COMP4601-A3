<meta name="summary" content="Wrongheaded"></head><body><p>Jack Black, hmm he was funny in a superior movie, High Fidelity, so I kept hoping he'd find something where his &quot;in your face edgy style&quot; would work, but alas, it does not work in School of Rock. This movie was not funny from start to finish because the &quot;Black&quot; shtick is wearing thin. How can this comedian play the same slacker over and over. He has no range at all. Hey, Bob Hope is overrated too. Also, the idea that smart kids learning nerdy stuff like classical music and algebra are creativly inhibited and unhappy is so completly wrongheaded, I couldn't bear to watch the poor little tykes go punk. Children should have the basics in youth. If they want to be rock stars and get laid, they ought to wait till they're at least 13. This movie is just wrong and Black has jumped the shark.</p></body></html>

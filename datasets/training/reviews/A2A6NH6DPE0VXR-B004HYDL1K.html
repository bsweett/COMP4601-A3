But unlike the Expendables, the movie doesn't take itself too serious. Machete is a retarded and cheesy flick that's trying to be a retarded and cheesy flick.<br />Lindsay Lohan even has fun poking fun at herself as a rich sleazy girl that constantly needs her father to bail her out of bad situations. Except, maybe she's so high these days that she doesn't realize she's poking fun at herself.<br />While you have Don Johnson (Miami Vice) as a boarder controller. Robert De Niro as an evil Senator that wants illegal aliens out of the U.S and Steven Seagal as the bad guy that just wants....Machete DEAD!!!!! There's just too much fun casting to mention. I can't wait for Robert Rodriguez to cast Paulie Shore as a bad guy in Machete 2 lol. Well I'm hoping he will anyway.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Universal Redeems itself (for Van Helsing) with this one!"></head><body><p>Universal Studios almost redeemed itself for Van Helsing as The Wolfman was a great, great remake!  Almost everything that I found to be terrible about the Van Helsing movie did not occur in the Wolfman. Wolfman took itself quite seriously, with creature effects that incorporated the original makeup marvelously updated, and great actors like Anthony Hopkins. Almost all of the original film inspired some portion of this film, which is due homage.  The new plot twists from the original were needed since we did not wish to know how this film would work out in the end.<br /><br />The special effects which involved computer animation were not quite as good as the makeup or the prosthetics which were used. Now tell me it was all computer animated. I think computer animation effects are much better suited for Sci-fi than horror and non-organic set type visuals, than live action creature effects. For example, I felt that the animation work on this film was good but not quite as effective as its close in makeup, or say An American Werewolf in London, which was definitely all prosthetics.  If anyone writes a comment that everything was computer animated in this film I will only say I am surprised (in advance). The creature effects in this film, (which I believe to be prosthetics) were absolutely amazing.<br /><br />I loved the depicted "sets" or corresponding computer generated settings, loved the costumes, loved the music, loved all the characters and absolutely loved Hopkins who always adds something magical to any movie.  I did not even know this movie was made until watching it recently on a rental.  I am going to purchase it from Amazon, after deciding if I want it in Blu-Ray or not. Universal, you can resume filming great remakes (like this one), all is forgiven. I was really steamed about Van Helsing.</p></body></html>

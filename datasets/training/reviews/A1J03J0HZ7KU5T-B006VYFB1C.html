<meta name="summary" content="Game Change"></head><body><p>Smashing adaptation of Michael Lewis' 2003 book on the Oakland A's management saga, with Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill delivering career-high performances. Propelled by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin's razor-sharp screenplay, director Bennett Miller works with a solid bench ranging from cinematography to supporting cast. An immediate classic, "Moneyball" was among the few 2011 Best Picture contenders that deserved the honor. Essential viewing . . . even if you're not a sports fan.</p></body></html>

The movie tells how Ed Norton tricked the inspector played by Giamatti to do the right thing in the end. The interesting part of the movie is to figure out how the Illusionist will win his true love. All the acting is good. Giamatti steals the show. Norton is his usual competent self. The cinematograpy is great. Glass's score is terrific. The biggest disappointment to me is that the tricks were all special effects. You don't know whether the illusionist is a trickster or a supernaturalist. The movie really never explains. I'm sure that confusion is intended. Some of the tricks defy explanation in the conventional sense in 19th century Vienna. The only thing "The Prestige" has over this movie is that some of the tricks were explained. In the Illusionist nothing is explained except for how they fooled the inspector.<br /><br />However, this fault is a small point. On the whole, I strongly recommend the movie. The locket is nice symbol throughout the movie of the love of the couple and life in general. The movie is very entertaining.</p></body></html>

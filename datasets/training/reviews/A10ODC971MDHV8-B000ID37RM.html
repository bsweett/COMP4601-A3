<meta name="summary" content="To Kill a Mockingbird"></head><body><p>A film that speaks volumes about ignorance and racial intolerance in our countrys recent past -  also a perceptive, study of the relationship between two children and their single-parent father, with much of the action seen through the childrens eyes. Peck deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actor. Make this required viewing for all children 12 and over.</p></body></html>

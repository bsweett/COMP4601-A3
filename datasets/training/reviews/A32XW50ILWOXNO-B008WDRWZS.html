German director Werner Herzog has made his share of great fiction movies about men embracing their id in the wilds of nature at the expense of their sanity, so the late Timothy Treadwell, the "Grizzly Man" that serves as the movie's title, is a perfect documentary subject. Treadwell got closer to these giant bears than anyone during the last 13 summers of his life until he and his girlfriend were killed by one.<br /><br />Herzog mostly uses Treadwell's own footage to reveal the story, and the results are unlikely and extraordinary. We see the bears in their element - on a plain and on an island of trees Treadwell dubs "The Grizzly Maze." Katmai National Park, scattered on the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, is a visual wonder, and the intimacy Treadwell achieves with the bears allows him to capture a bear fight as intense and vicious as any nature film I've ever seen. Uncut and filmed at close range, it is a titanic, beautiful struggle that involves primal strategy and raw strength. It is riveting as a later shot of bears sprinting on a beach is playful.<br /><br />But there is much more.<br /><br />Treadwell uses his camera as a confessional. A decent man with a reasonably laudible aims morphs into a profane, disturbed meglomaniac whose emotional issues likely drove him to Alaska to live with bears who tolerate him but, as the footage shows, don't consider him a family friend. We learn he is a failed actor, a mild con artist, a loner who pretends on film he is alone when he is not,  and, above all, a man who plays at being virtuous when he quite clearly thinks he is owed more acclaim and gratitude that he gets.<br /><br />Herzog first shows his temper in a hilarious scene where a fox steals Treadwell's hat. Later, Treadwell vents when tourists come to photograph the bears. Later still, he launches a vulgar rant against the National Park Service that makes "Grizzly Man" unsuitable for kids but essential to the man and the film. Treadwell thinks he's out there for the bears. He's really out there for himself. So anyone of us would be, for we do not go to the zoo so the animals can see us. We go to see the animals.<br /><br />Treadwell needs to declare himself, to say "I am." Bears don't. Bears act out of instinct and conditioning. Treadwell expresses, and does so out of thought. Without stating it,  "Grizzly Man" is a convincing argument against the evolutionary theory that suggests man arose from the clay of beasts. It's also a compelling case against Treadwell's mission, which seems to be little more than hanging around bears and filming them. Treadwell claims, quite often, to be "protecting" them. From what?<br /><br />His other mission is education. Stunning as the photography is, what I learned from "Grizzly Man" about bears is that they're bears. That in itself is divine but Treadwell wants to go further and impose human traits on them, which seem absurd the day he finds a baby grizzly's skull picked clean by other bears. Finally Treadwell gets dumb and stays in the "Maze" later in the summer than he should. The familiar bears are gone, replaced by one who eventually kills him. He probably captures the bear on tape, and we see a close-up of its beady brown eyes. Not a flicker of humanity. We shouldn't expect there to be.</p></body></html>

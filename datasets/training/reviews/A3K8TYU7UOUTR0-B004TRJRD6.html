<meta name="summary" content="Still keeps me staring out of the darkness"></head><body><p>It is simply amazing to me how well this film has held up over the years. For my money, it is still one of the most effective movies ever made. It is intense, serious, thought provoking, and hypnotic all at once. I saw this film when it was released. Some friends and I snuck into a drive-in (we were all under-age) and hid in the back in the bushes near an open speaker. It kept us all quiet, tense and staring out of the darkness at the screen, struggling to hear the faint crackling of the nearby speaker. All these years later, I bought the DVD, and it is the movie I remember, and then some. <p>In this age of computer, whiz-bang effects, this is still the top of the horror genre with no close competition, but it is far more than a genre. It has something that seems forgotten today - a great story, great writing, and great film editing. There are certain scenes of exorcism, with Max Von Sydow and the great, nearly forgotten Jason Miller, which are the most powerful in screen history. Only the "russian roulette" scene in Deer Hunter comes to mind as a comparison.<p>Lee J. Cobb (another great actor that is slipping from public memory) is memorable as Lieutenant Kinderman, and Ellen Burstyn seems to be living the movie more than acting within it. <p>So much has changed since this film was made - so many advances in the technology of filmmaking and even ways that we view or think of a movie. I think the primary secret of this film is the almost somber, deadly way it takes itself completely seriously. There is no comic relief in this picture, and no romantic interest. A human soul is possessed by the Devil. Only the Will of God can save her, a faith displayed by his representatives on earth. <p>Riveting and satisfying.</p></body></html>

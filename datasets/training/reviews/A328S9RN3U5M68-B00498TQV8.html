Based on the successful novel by author Daniel Woodrell who explains the choice of title explain at the back of his book: "The `Winter's' part of the title is obvious, and the `Bone' part comes from slang. It can be stated wryly, sarcastically, even tenderly, when throwing a sop to someone, `Oh, give him a bone.' In this case, it is winter itself giving a gift, a bone, to Ree Dolly. The season knows she has earned it, and the term suggests the double-edged aspect of the gesture and is suited to the novel,"  writer Anne Rosellini and writer/director Debra Granik have adapted this story for film and in doing so have presented one of the finest artistic successes of the year.<br /><br />The setting is contemporary Missouri Ozarks where people barely survive, especially during the winter.  Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence in a stunningly sophisticated  performance) is seventeen years old, living in a shack with her clinically depressed mother and her brother and sister: her father Jessup is missing, having been arrested for his dealings in making Crank (crystal meth) - the only source of income for many of the folk in the area, folk who also are users - and posted bail using his house and land as collateral.  Ree has a tough time as the only responsible person for her family and when the local sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) visits to inform Ree that Jessup has skipped town and that if he doesn't show up for his court date, Ree's home and land will be absconded, Ree is devastated.  Ree seeks advice from her many relatives who adamantly refuse to help her out of fear of discovery of involvement in the drug business: Ree sets out to find her father.  She turns to every member of her family (it would seem that most everyone in this pitiful area is blood) she is turned down for help - especially from her father's brother Teardrop (John Hawkes) who hesitantly warns her that her father is dead.  She finally gains some assistance through her perseverance only to discover that that Jessup is dead and she is forced to dredge his body from the river to cut off his hands to prove to the court that her father is dead and the threat of evacuation is nullified.<br /><br />The casting of this film is a little miracle: down to the smallest role each actor is exactly right in creating the sullen and desperate atmosphere of this story.  There are rare moments when the tale is not grim, moments such as the gathering of banjo and guitar players in a Pickin' Session to accompanying the singing of a Marideth Sisco.  The cinematography by Michael McDonough  and the musical choices made by Dickon Hinchliffe  recreate the desolation of this pitiful community of people living on the edge in the Ozarks.  But towering above all of this is the performance by Jennifer Lawrence who will undoubtedly now rise to prominence. Grady Harp, October 10</p></body></html>

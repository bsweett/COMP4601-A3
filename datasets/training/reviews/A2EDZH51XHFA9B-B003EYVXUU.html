I certainly wouldn't go that far--the original, Let the Right One In, was hands-down the best film of 2008, whereas Let Me In has a great deal of competition for that spot. And yet there is a great deal to like here, and while I did find myself picking it apart in a number of places, I can't deny it's one of the best horror films to come out of the Hollywood machine in the past decade, a feat which is even more impressive given how horribly Hollywood tends to treat its remakes.<br /><br />Plot, in case you missed the original (go see it now, I'll wait) and didn't read the book (which you should also do at your earliest convenience): Owen (The Road's Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a bullied twelve-year-old with delusions of grandeur, parents going through a divorce, and very little hope of anything interesting happening in his life. Until, that is, Abby ((500) Days of Summer's Chloe Moretz) moves in next door with her odd guardian (The Visitor's Richard Jenkins). The two of them begin a hesitant relationship, though Abby warns Owen away repeatedly; still, she seems desperate for human contact, and Owen's passivity draws her; she offers him advice on how to deal with the school's idiot bullies. Meanwhile, a serial killer gears up in the area. You don't have to be a genius to know what's coming, especially since everyone and their mothers has already spoiled it for you, including the film's tagline: Abby is a vampire, and everyone knows it except Owen.<br /><br />High point: Reeves (Cloverfield), working with John Ajvide Lindqvist on this adaptation, stuck a lot closer to the book than did Let the Right One In (which, interestingly, Lindqvist also wrote the adaptation for); within the first five minutes, you understand Owen is a pretty deeply disturbed individual, whereas in the original film he's pretty much the quintessential nice guy who's guaranteed to finish last. Low point: there's still a lot of deviation from the source material, and some of it comes off quite odd. It's obvious they were planning on including a lot more of the book, but veered off at the last minute. (Why is Owen's father even in this movie? And while it's obvious on one level what Abby means when she says "I'm not a girl", there's a scene about two-thirds of the way through the film with a photograph that tells me that Reeves and Lindqvist were salivating to include the book's huge, huge plot twist in that regard... which then disappears, never to be seen again.)<br /><br />High point: Smit-McPhee and Moretz are very good actors, probably as good as Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leanderson (Oskar and Eli in the original). Low point: everyone else in the movie either comes off as cardboard (Cara Buono, playing Owen's mother, is a prime example, or the bullies) or doesn't get nearly enough screen time to really let their talents come forth (Jenkins, or Elias Koteas as the investigating officer).<br /><br />High point: whereas the original film focused almost solely on the romance angle (it would be really, really tough to even call Let the Right One In a horror film were it not for the "what happens if I don't invite you in?" scene... oh, more on that next paragraph), Let Me In definitely wants to play in horror movie territory, and it does it passably well--though this is a horror film in the vein of such recent faves of mine as Shallow Ground and Deadbirds, where if you come expecting ultragore, you're bound to be disappointed. Low point: a lot of what's missing from the book is the themes and scenes that really drive the horror angle home. Most notably absent is Abby's/Eli's sociopathy; it's never less than obvious in the book that all she really needs Owen/Oskar for is as a replacement handler. She wants to break through that wall inside her that keeps her from having friends (and lovers, one assumes; the pedophilia aspect of the book is touched on here, but only barely, in one brief scene, and you probably wouldn't even notice it had you not read the book), but she's incapable of doing so. Here, Abby seems... well, a more normal, well-adjusted kid than Owen, which is odd when you consider the fact that Abby is a couple of centuries older than you are. Also missing are the neighbor who owns the basement room (and whose mother, in the novel, is having a burgeoning relationship with the Elias Koteas character), the barflies who provide a major subplot (though the main pair are kind of remade here as a yuppie couple), and, as noted above, Owen's dad, who is mentioned once briefly, then appears in a phone conversation, and... that's it. And I'm just scratching the surface.<br /><br />High point: what gore there is in this movie is really nicely done. (The goriest scene in the film is, ironically, also its funniest; Richard Jenkins knows comic timing.) Low point: if you're going to blow one of the gore scenes, the one to blow is not the iconic "what happens if I don't invite you in?" scene. Oh, god, what a letdown. If you have seen this, see the original if only for that scene, if you haven't, to show how effective a minimal special effects budget can still be.<br /><br />So yeah, not as good as the original film, which was as good as (though a different beast than) the novel on which both are based. But still, in most cases the good outweighs the bad here, and if you compare it to the other horror movies that came out in 2010--at least those I've seen--it stands head and shoulders above the crowd. Worth your time. *** ?</p></body></html>

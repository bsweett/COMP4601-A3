<meta name="summary" content="A pretty funny tale of a rise and fall and rise"></head><body><p>Will Ferrell and John  C. Reilly were perfectly cast here as best friends who grow up to be racers on the pro track.  Along the way, there is marriage, lots of money being spent, two rotten kids, a sensible grandma, a crash that leads to paralyzing fear, and the return of a prodigal father who somehow gives his grown son a push in the right direction so he can race once again.<br /><br />The story tends to drag on much longer than it needs to; this is unusual in a comedy.  But it is still funny and worth watching for a great cast and some very funny dialogue.</p></body></html>

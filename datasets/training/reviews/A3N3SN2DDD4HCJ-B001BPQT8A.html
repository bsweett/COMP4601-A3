It doesn't surprise me. &quot;Seven&quot; takes typical cop-film ideas and morphs them into a dark, creepy, memorable tale of serial murder. The violence of the film is psychological, because what's really disturbing is the things the film makes you think about, not on screen gore. Look closely and you'll see that there is not that much violence in the movie, it's the brilliant way in which Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker (8MM, Sleepy Hollow) set up mood and atmosphere. The cinematography is dark, beautiful and shadowy, giving the impression that there are evil things lurking in the shadows or just down the hall. The characters can be believed, and we really do care about them when the final shock comes. The performances are also superb, not least Kevin Spacey's serial killer, John Doe, who seems like a cousin of Hannibal Lecter. &quot;Seven&quot; also has a mind, the details of the plot are complex because they are not just materialistic things, you really have to think, to examine the ideas and thoughts in the story. This is the film, which I think, remains David Fincher's masterpiece. His latest, &quot;Fight Club,&quot; was less intelligent or memorable. It was good, but doesn't go in league with this masterwork of the macabre. &quot;Seven&quot; raises chilling little feelings in you, disturbing thoughts and ideas, which is what great horror is supposed to do, yet it never loses intelligence. This special DVD edition will offer more material to better understand the film's structure, there's even a look at the making of John Doe's notebooks. &quot;Seven&quot; is a must for those who love a smart, creepy tale.</p></body></html>

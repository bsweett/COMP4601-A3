<meta name="summary" content="Hostel Is Not a Horror Movie. 23 out of 100."></head><body><p>Please, do not see this. Save your money. Hostel (unrated) is nothing more than 90 minutes of naked women, drugs and extreme gore.  Hostel is everything you hate about Hollywood filmmaking. Hostel is not a horror movie, but rather a torture movie.<br /><br />I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie with more nudity or gore than Hostel. It is not a movie at all, in fact, because a movie implies that there is a plot and that you are entertained. If you consider people screaming at the top of their lungs to be a choir, Hostel is for you. If you consider the dropping of a paint can, and the resulting splatter to be art, Hostel is for you. If you consider punching another to be a viable form of expressive affection, Hostel is for you. If you want heroin legalized in America, Hostel is for you. If disemboweling people is erotic to you, buy Hostel today! I am serious. That is how disgusting this movie is. The scenes are beyond shocking, and completely sickeing. I am glad my wife didn't watch, for she would have tossed up her dinner.<br /><br />Seriously, Hostel is over the edge and sickening. I am nearly forty and have seen my share of gore and horror movies, but this nearly made me sick. There was endless vomit, limbs being cut off, eyes being clipped out, etc. That is all that Hostel was: a torture movie. People torturing others, literally. This is not a date movie, nor is it a horror movie. It is really not a movie at all. Hostel is a sick fantasy for those who like extreme sex and violence together.<br /><br />Do not watch Hostel. The scenes linger in your mind for days, and you wish you could shake them. Hostel is disgusting and brutal This is the sickest film I have ever seen, and will never give my money to this director's movies again.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 23<br /><br />7 (out of 50).

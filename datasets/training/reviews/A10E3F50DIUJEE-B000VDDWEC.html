You are all alone in one of the most bustling cities in the entire world ...? Pretty scary.  Now imagine finding out how that came to be ...? Also terrifying.  Like a Lovecraft tale of terror, Boyle takes us on an adventure for truth and survival with the excellent Cillian Murphy.<br /><br />Apocalyptic story lovers will not be disappointed with this film.<br /><br />Highly recommend!</p></body></html>

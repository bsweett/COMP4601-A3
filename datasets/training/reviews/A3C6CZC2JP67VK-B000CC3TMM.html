<meta name="summary" content="Transporter 2 was definitely far-fetched and over the top!"></head><body><p>I couldn't believe they even made a Transporter 2, the first one was alright but I didn't think it would get this far but I guess the rest of the world seem to enjoyed it. Now, I'm all for a good action film, but this was a little TO Hollywood for my book. If you're wanted to see this for plot, and as a realistic high standard action film, you're going to be VERY disappointed. The stunts though really cool looking, are virtually impossible to pull off -- realistically. The transporter was almost superman-like in a film that was based on a realistic present day world, and he pulled off things that SHOULD NOT and COULD NOT have happened. This is the negative side to the film, and really the plot was Mediocre at best. While watching this last night I realize there are parts which are incredibly stupid, like the character of Frank Martin and the villain fighting on an out-of-control airplane, the silly things like having the French policeman from the first film being arrested and teaching the cadets at the police station how to make fine French cuisine(??), or the fact that there's this Jamaican guy that shows up out of nowhere at the end of the movie for comedic value(???), or the fact that you can spin a car in mid-air, have the bottom of the car hit a wrecking ball, which knocks off a remote-triggered bomb that blows up after dislodging, and land the car safely(????), or the fact that there are hardly any police to be found in the city...and so on.<br /><br />Even though it's made by a European director and producer and funded with European money, something that gave the first such a unique feel, this feels an awful lot like a Hollywood trash flick. Since the end hints a third, one can only hope that Leterrier and Besson get their act together. What began as a series made in the style of Taxi, Ronin, and Kiss of the Dragon has ended up tumbling into world where movies like Stealth and SWAT lived. And that isn't good.<br /><br />Again this is an action movie with twists and turns, some believable, some not so. If you liked The Fifth Element, The Professional, Le Femme Nikita, and True Lies, this is your movie. If you grew up on Bond, Dukes, and Blade Runner, you'll love it.</p></body></html>

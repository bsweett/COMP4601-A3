<meta name="summary" content="Awesome Comic Book Movie"></head><body><p>This is without a doubt my favorite comic book movie. Yeah, Spiderman is good and all, but there's just something about X-Men that I find more interesting-- maybe because everyone can find something to relate to in an X-Men character. And I like that there's more than one hero and that the bad guy is a mutant, yet unlike the mutant heroes.<br /><br />This is the second installment, the third is on the way (can't wait!) and we re-join the mutants at "Mutant High," which is also the secret base of the elite X-Men. The film begins with an action scene, one of the best I've ever seen, in which a mutant teleporter attempts to kill the President as a protest against the anti-mutant sentiment that has swept the nation. Jean and Storm are sent by Xavier, the leader of the X-Men, to track down the teleporter, who was actually forced to attack the President by a man named Stryker, a non-mutant who has developed a mind-controlling serum and also has a great dislike for mutants and hoped his attack would force the government to get rid of the mutants.<br /><br />Great film, lots of cool action scenes, and some of the holes of the first film are finally filled in, getting more information about Wolverine. You don't have to like comics to like this movie, just have a like for action or a like for a good story. This movie has both. This movie isn't quite as comic bookey as Spiderman 2 was actually. Check this one out some time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Welcome to the party, pal!""></head><body><p>Die Hard is an exciting action packed movie directed by John McTiernan (Last Action Hero).<br /><br />The movie stars Bruce Willis as troublemaker New York cop John McClane who visits his wife in her Los Angeles workplace, a big firm called Nakatomi Corporations, at the same time a group of European terrorists take over the firm and hold everybody hostage. But they're in for a surprise, McClane is going to drive them up the walls in a cat and mouse game all around the building while the clueless LA police stands aside.<br /><br />The movie is similar to the Rambo films in that McClane alone battles the entire group of bad guys, but Die Hard maintains its own identity thanks to Willis' sense of humor and catchy one-liners.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B+</p></body></html>

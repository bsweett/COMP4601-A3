<meta name="summary" content="Cleaned Up Directors Version!"></head><body><p>Star Trek the Motion Picture!<br /><br />I did a rewatching of this film recently and even though I have the original VHS tape, the "special longer version" is much cleaned up from the theatrical release.<br /><br />Robert Wise directs this Alan Dean Foster story (similar but only on a general way to The Original Series ("TOS") The Changeling.<br /><br />In "The Changeling" the Enterprise was nearly hit by a high energy beam from a small probe that turned out to be a mix between Voyager and an alien probe.  It was attempting to find its Creator, a Mr. Roykirk, which it mistook for James Kirk.  Its mission was to sterilize imperfection -- when Kirk pointed out that it too was imperfect, it sterilized itself!<br /><br />We start out with Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score, which was later used extensively and every TV program of Star Trek: The Next Generation, a fact I completely forgot about until hearing it.  And, the Klingons were changed to having ridges on their foreheads and looking more alien, another aspect continued through the next twenty plus years of Trek.  This was a big deal to the original fans, though TNG guys now take this in stride.<br /><br />The movie is about tension in many ways:<br /><br />Spock is conflicted between his Vulcan heritage and his desire for the stars, which we see on the barren, red hot orange planet Vulcan as he fails the Kolinar.<br /><br />Tension between Kirk and Decker who was going to command the Enterprise until Kirk came aboard.<br /><br />And the new crew member Lt. Ilia, who plays a vital role in the story.  She is a member of Delta, who need to take an oath of celibacy since their sexual superiority puts males into fits of insanity (per the novelized version).  The sexual tension is underplayed in this PG 13 film.<br /><br />Starbases are blasted, Klingons are electrified and V'ger, the huge cloud entity wants its creator and wants him/her NOW!<br /><br />The usual Kirk double-speak with alien life forms does not fly as well as in the past.<br /><br />McCoy's crankiness and large beard were also quite fun to see again.<br /><br />The "long part" with the traveling through the cloud is actually edited down in this version and from what I understand, the DVD version does even better in cleaning up the special effects, the cloud effects and such.  The Warp Drive effect is a bit hokey but that's just me being spoiled by TNG.<br /><br />Overall, a good introduction and kick-off by Paramount to get the franchise off the ground.  Thank God for The Wrath of Khan or else we would have stopped at that point.<br /><br />Great effort by Wise and crew.<br /><br />Better:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKHP">Star Trek - The Motion Picture: The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TH16DI">Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection (The Motion Picture / The Wrath of Kahn / The Search for Spock / The Voyage Home / The Final Frontier / The ...

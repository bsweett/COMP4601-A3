<meta name="summary" content="Martial arts, the spirit of the cartoon, and pure entertainment!"></head><body><p>When I think about pure entertainment I'm not necessarily thinking about a traditional comedy.  Rather, I think about a feeling I get when I'm sitting there and watching outrageous actions on the screen and I'm constantly giggling.  Such is the delight of Kung Fu Hustle, a brainchild of Stephen Chow from Hong Kong who wrote, directed and stars in this rather outrageous spoof of martial arts movie.  He's also captured the spirit of American cartoon characters, the ones that get hit on the head with a hammer and come up smiling, or whose legs turn into a roadrunner in order to flee disaster.  This is the stuff that this 2004 film is made of - a rare piece of clever entertainment.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a group of poor but hardworking people who live in Pigsty Alley.  However there just happen to be three accomplished martial artists in their midst.  One is a tailor.  One is a hen-pecked husband.  And one is a matronly woman in a shapeless housedress and curlers who always has a cigarette dangling from her mouth.  Into this neighborhood comes our star, Stephen Chow and his chubby sidekick.  They pretend they belong to the Axe Gang so that they can shakedown the people for a little money.  They're stopped cold in their tracks though.  And soon there is more than only the three unlikely martial artists of Pig Sty Alley they have to contend with.  There's the real Axe gang itself.<br /><br />The action never stops and the story plays out with outrageous martial arts scenes enhanced by the use of modern technology, concealed wires, and special effects.<br /><br />On the negative side, the film did drag a bit though, especially near the end when the jokes had already worn thin.  But I think just a few more feet on the cutting room floor would be all it needs.<br /><br />Kung Fu Hustle is a rare treat.  I definitely recommend it.</p></body></html>

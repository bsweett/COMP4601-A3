<meta name="summary" content=""A Worthy Remake""></head><body><p>Despite what critics and fans have said about "The Fog", this film is a great remake of a classic horror film. It isn't Oscar material, but what scary movie is. It is meant to be fun and campy and I actually enoyed it. I will also admit I am a huge fan of Tom Welling, and there is a great scene in the film where he takes his shirt off: that is worth the price of the movie.<br /> The film basically follows the same plot as the original in which a huge fog bank descends upon Antonio Bay and all hell breaks loose. Lots of surprise elements are included, and there were many times I jumped while watching it.<br /> The DVD has some great bonuses, including commentary by the director, deleted scenes, and a great documentary on remaking a classic.<br /> When the new version of "The Fog" came out in 2006 it debut at #1 at the boxoffice, eventually accumulating a gross of over 26 million dollars: someone liked it!<br /> Sit back, make some popcorn and enjoy a great, scary film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A very harmful movie!"></head><body><p>For 3 generations our families children were read stories from the Grimm Brothers.  Then when i was a child myself i saw on the huge Cinerama screen "The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm."  What a wonderful piece of work and it has become a part of my collection of Videos until it's released on DVD.<br /><br />This new version is a drug trip gone wrong in Hollywood.  There is NO WAY you could ever take a child to see this film.  He would be scared out of his mind.  What has gone so wrong in Hollywood that they can distort wonderful literature.  Those people in Hollywood are getting more and more pervertly sick in every way.  No wonder people are not going to the movies like they use to.  To me, it shows how the Hollywood film makers looks at life. Everything to them is violent.  I was just going to say something bad about Terry Gilliam, but then i would be just as guilty as he is.  This is the beginning of the end for Hollywood.</p></body></html>

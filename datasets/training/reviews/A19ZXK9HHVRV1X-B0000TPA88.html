And I must say that, now, having seen it, I can't understand what all the fuss was about.  This is a perfectly serviceable big budget action movie as such things go - not much better, but certainly no worse, than half a dozen similar movies released that summer (it's actually less bloated than the far more popular "Pirates of the Caribbean" which inexplicably garnered rave reviews and sailed off with boatloads of money).<br /><br />It's 1899, the dawn of a new century, one in which all the old weapons of war are fast becoming obsolete and are giving way to far more lethal implements of mass destruction - machine guns, armored tanks, submarines and mega-explosives - all capable of killing far greater numbers of people than was ever thought possible before.  Enter the Fantom [sic], a mysterious villain bent on using all this quickly developing technology to wage a global war with himself as commanding general.  To counter this, a man named "M" gathers together a group of characters culled from 19th Century literary sources - among them Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, Dorian Gray, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, even Tom Sawyer! - to do battle against the menace.<br /><br />Although the script could have done a better job fleshing out the characters and making them more intriguing and distinct as individuals, the film has a couple of interesting plot twists and enough high-tech hardware to keep us entertained, if not exactly enthralled, through most of its running time.  The movie is breezily paced and the screenplay has a fun time tossing around a lot of "in" jokes for those in the audience familiar with the literary backgrounds of these various characters.<br /><br />Sean Connery leads the cast as Allan Quartermain, an aging adventurer contentedly wiling away his golden years in Africa, until he is called back into the queen's service at this critical juncture in the empire`s - and the world's - history.  Naseeruddin Shah,  Peta Wilson, Tony Curran, Stuart Townsend, Shane West, Jason Flemyng and Richard Roxburgh round out the rest of the cast.<br /><br />There really isn't anything that "extraordinary" about this "League," but if you happen to run across this film on cable some long, lonely night, you may find it passable for an evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

As a fan of the director(Dawn of the Dead, 300) I was really pleased at what he brought to the screen.  The series was 12 issues long with lots of panels and dialog, as well as a lengthy monologue.  So yes, it was a comic, but it really packed a lot into each page.  Though the movie ran nearly 3 hours, I honestly don't know what he could have cut to make it shorter without taking away any important plot points or character building sequences.  He managed to stay faithful to the comic and changed only the ending, which I thought was better than the comic ending anyway.  Fairly good casting is highlighted by Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach.  I was scratching my head when I first heard about this bit of casting, but he was truly phenomenal in his role and spot on with the comic.  This movie is a fairly solid R with some strong violence, sex scenes, nudity including blue penis and a little language, though that is fairly tame.  A good super hero movie and a very good adaptation of the comic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Honest film making/story telling."></head><body><p>Excellent movie that tells the horrors of the genocide in Rwanada and what the world did or did not do to to help. The movie presents the story and events in a very straightforward / unglamorized mannor which makes it all the more realistic.<br /><br />It also explains the root history of the origins of the conflict in Rwanada -- a small place that most of the world would just rather not learn about.</p></body></html>

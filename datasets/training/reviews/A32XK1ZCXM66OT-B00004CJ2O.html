<meta name="summary" content="A true horror and thriller classic...."></head><body><p>I have to admit, I was impressed with this film. Due to the fact that isn't just a horror and slasher film. This film is a very stylish thriller, cause uses the plot idea from Agatha Christie's "And then there were none" and puts a modern spin on things. Basically, the story takes place at a place called "Camp Crystal Lake". Where two young counselors are murder, when they sneak off to be alone. Of course, the camp is shut down after that and is not opened. That is until 40 years later, a new group has taken over the campsite and is going to try open it again. However, the group consists of very young, naive and inexperince people. Once the group learns about the camp's history. They are soon stalked and hunted down by an unknown assailant, who is bent on making sure that the camp is never opened. Now, the group must fight to stay alive until morning comes and they can get help. This film is truly impressive!!! Also Betsy Palmer and Adrianne King were true credits to this film. They did a remarkable job with thier roles.</p></body></html>

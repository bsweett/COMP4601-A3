<meta name="summary" content=""The Dismal Tide""></head><body><p>Times have changed. Surely that's what Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) has in mind when he visits an old friend and commiserates about how things ain't like they used to be.  "This land's hard," muses his friend.  Another police friend has examples of kids with green hair and bones in their noses who have left out "Sir," and "Ma'am" out of their vocabulary.  They both shake their heads over "The dismal tide".<br /><br />But, really we're not all that ready for the events that happen, either.  Significantly, a chilling psychopath, Chigurh (Javier Bardem) goes on a rampage, slipping out of a U.S. border town deputy's hands with the coolest and calloused of skill. He's involved with a drug ring, one that has a shoot out that's left about a dozen dead in the desert.  Besides a gun that has the force of a lightening bolt, his weapon of choice is an electrical device--one that's meant to quickly put cattle out of their misery (something like a hydrolic nail dispenser).  Just like Tommy Lee Jone's portrayal of Two Face in 'Batman Forever' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790731002">Batman Forever</a> his bitterness of fate has his victims choosing heads or tails in a coin toss, meant to mirror the randomness of bitter fortune in his own life.  The difference is that in the 'Batman' movie it was campy; here it comes across with deadly solemnity--one that hits you right between the eyes.  The only one who comes the closest to understanding him is Carson Wells, (Woody Harrelson), a man with corporate ties whose one conversation reveals quite a lot.<br /><br />So it goes with the rest of the movie.  A Vietnam vet, Llewelyn (Josh Brolin), takes the center stage.  While hunting antelope in the desert, he comes across the aftermath of the shootout and discovers a cache' of money.  He isn't too forthcoming with his wife, Clara Jean (Kelly Macdonald), but he's on a mission as someone who hasn't seen too many breaks in his own life.  Chigurh's stalking has so many twists to it that I found myself craning my neck as if I had to look around the corner from getting shot.  It's all cat and mouse, and the villain seems to almost possess an unnerving omniscience for anyone who gets in his way.  Chigurh eventually uses Clara Jean as bait for Llewllyn to give the money back.  While I've seen many movies where the villain uses the spouse as bait, this movie rendered it so refreshingly original, I felt I was watching this plot component for the first time.<br /><br />It has been said that the Coen Brothers are masters of plot.  Here they draw from the same-titled novel by Cormac McCarthy.  While I haven't read the novel, I am grateful that, although I'm a big Coen Brothers fan, they didn't resort to kidnapping in any frame of the movie.  Besides that I never knew where this movie was going.  There's still the ingenuity of the Coen Brothers' irony, but they rely heavily on one of the most chilling portrayals of any villain I can think of in cinematic history.  This movie is also the most violent of any I've seen this year.  (Considering I've seen '3:10 to Yuma' and 'Eastern Promises' among them, that's saying a lot.)<br /><br />For all it's innovation and startling violence, 'No Country for Old Men' has to be one of the tensest and best movies woven together all year.<br /><br />(The special features are worthwhile.  I must note that if you're looking for a definite commentary for the ending, you'll need to look elsewhere [although they certainly explain the theme well which is at least half of the framed ending.]  "Working with the Coens" goes for less than eight minutes.  Commentary on the movie is worthwhile and clocks in at about 23:00.  There's also a worthy third section that is approximately seven minutes long. For me I couldn't get enough.  If you don't mind going behind the curtain to see the secrets of the magic show, then the extras are quite worthwhile.  [Within Amazon Miles Moore's commentary "Yes, Virginia, There's a Plot Resolution in 'No Country for Old Men'" illuminated a lot for me.  Some other discussions suffice.]  I think Cormac McCarthy wanted people to have the theme and concepts stuck in their heads rather than a neat resolution.  Real life is often like that.  I keep thinking of real life serial killers:  Son of Sam and The Zodiac Killer.  Justice catches up to them, but some things in life are elusive--just like the movie.  I like being able to glimpse Sherrif Bell's head at the end.  "You don't know what He (God) thinks," says Bell's friend, played by Barry Corbin.  (This character is essential for assuaging Bell from stepping into the chasms of pride and despair.)  I think there's hope "kindled" in Bell's mind at the end, but you can buy this film and watch it over and over again and decide for yourself.)</p></body></html>

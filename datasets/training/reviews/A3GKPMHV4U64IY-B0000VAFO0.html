The vampires think they have almost won the war completely.  Things have been going their way ever since they eliminated the lycan leader Lucien.  But a vampire Deathdealer (Kate Beckinsdale) discovers there may be more lycans than they thought and they may be better organized.  To make it worse, the lycans have also managed to get a hold of some nasty weaponry that is deadly to the vampires.  But none of the other vampires seems to believe the threat that Kate knows is out there so she disobeys orders and investigates on her own.<br /><br />She learns that the lycans were following a human for some reason.  Kate tries to figure out why and along the way she develops feelings for the human.  Things really heat up when one of the vampire elders is awakened and has to deal with the changing situations.  Plot and counter-plot abound and we learn more of the history of the two races and their feud.  In the end the whole movie seems more like the first part of a much larger story.  I have not yet seen the sequel so I don't know how well it continues the story.<br /><br />The effects for the movie were pretty good although there are few clear shots of the lycans.  Most of the film almost feels black and white as there is very little color.  There are also many references to the histories and the war and it seems like the numbers get a little confused.  But this is an action-thriller and details like that often suffer so one expects it.  The only real problem I had with the film was the way it felt like it was setting up a larger story.  With the success of the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies one can certainly believe that such an attempt could be possible.  We shall see.  One thing I really liked was they way the two societies were portrayed.  While equally intelligent the vampires acted like aristocrats while the werewolves were far more bestial.

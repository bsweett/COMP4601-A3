<meta name="summary" content="Very interesting-can be confusing"></head><body><p>This movie is not just one movie it is many movies rolled into one.  There are many characters that interact that it can be confusing.<br /><br />There is Prime Minister David played by Hugh Grant who is in love with one of his attendants named Natalie.<br /><br />There is David's sister Karen played by Emma Thomson who is married with two children and finds out that her husband wants to have an affair with his secretary.<br /><br />There is also Daniel played by Liam Neeson who is a new widower who has the responsibility of raising his step-son Sam played by Hugh Grants real life cousin. Daniel's step-son is having problems though. He is in love with a girl at school who he thinks does not even know he is alive. He and Daniel come up with a plan that gets her to notice him at the end though.<br /><br />There is also Jamie, played by Colin Firth whose wife cheated on him so he goes to France to write a book. He falls in love with a maid at his cottage that is Portuguese and goes back to London to learn Portuguese so he can ask her to marry him.<br /><br />There is also Colin who strikes out a lot in London and thinks that he needs to go to the U.S. to get laid. His friend tries to dissuade him from going, but Colin eventually goes to Wisconsin where he meets several woman.<br /><br />Colin's friend is a producer who is making a porno movie and the two stand ins for the main characters fall in love while doing the things needed for the movie.<br /><br />There is also Juliet played by Kiera Knightly who finds out that her husband's best friend has a crush on her.<br /><br />There is also a character named Bill. He is a former singer who wants to have a comeback so he performs a Christmas version of Love is all Around that sucks, but makes it to number one.<br /><br />And last, but not least there is Sarah played by Laura Linney. She works in the office of Karen's husband who is in love with a man named Karl who works with her. On the night of the office Christmas party they get together, but there is one complication- her brother. He is mentally ill and calls all the time, he even calls her right before Sarah and Karl get together which stops them in their tracks.<br /><br />All in all a very funny, poignant look at several lives at Christmas</p></body></html>

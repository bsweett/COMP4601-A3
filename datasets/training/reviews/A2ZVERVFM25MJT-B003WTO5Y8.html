<meta name="summary" content="Terrific thriller"></head><body><p>Every so often there is a movie that really makes you sit up and take notice, something that restores your faith in the entire genre.  'Silence Of The Lambs' is just one of those movies, earning cult status and getting numerous awards.  It's an undeniably tense thriller that follows Clarice Starling (Foster) as she trails a serial killer nicknamed 'Buffalo Bill', who has kidnapped a senator's daughter and murdered several before her.  When all leads seem to have dried up she turns to Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lectre (Hopkins), a dangerous serial killer and psychologist who Buffalo Bill has been writing to for help.  However, he'll only give Clarice information if she'll talk about herself, her career and her upbringing.<p>It's not so much the story that is groundbreaking here rather than the way in which it mounts up tension so precisely.  Whilst there are admitedly several violent scenes here it will be the meetings between Clarice and Hannibal that will really make your hair stand on end.  Foster and Hopkins give the performances of their career as a young officer eager to impress and an eloquent killer respectively.  There are no characters that fail to make an impression and this is perhaps the movie's strongest point in that all its characters have become so instantly recognisable in movie lore.<p>With its gritty and compelling photography, 'Silence Of The Lambs' is very different to both its prequel 'Manhunter' and the much glossier 'Hannibal'.  It is often regarded as one of the best thriller/horror movies ever made, and rightly so.  Not only is it scary but it's also gripping and intelligent.  It is a memorable movie that impresses on every level.</p></body></html>

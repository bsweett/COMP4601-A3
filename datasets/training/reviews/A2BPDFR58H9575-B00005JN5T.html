<meta name="summary" content="Two Hours of Fun?"></head><body><p>I think -yes.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of sequels, toilet humor, little dogs humping everything that moves, overdone baby jokes, "Fockered" jokes, and Ben Stiller. Barbra Streisand is not on my list of the favorite actors, either. But I saw "Meet the Fockers", I laughed out loud, I liked it a lot and I may see it again on DVD. Dustin Hoffman was hilarious - wild and crazy; together with Streisand they made a great team. Streisand was very funny as a Jewish Mama (I am dying to say Mother Focker - but it's been said hundreds times already. Well, I did say that :)) - Sex Therapist for octogenarians. They were the best things about the movie, and it was enough for me to spend very nice two hours (my husband and my son enjoyed it, too. Actually, it's been quite some time since I saw my husband laughing so hard at the movies).<br /><br />3.5/5 or 7/10</p></body></html>

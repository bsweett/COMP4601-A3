I gotta go.""></head><body><p>The problem with films like "Man on Fire" which features Denzel Washington as a disillusioned, suicidal/not so semi homicidal ex-mercenery CIA ex everything badass is that they tap into our worst impulses as human beings: the instinct for immediate, bloody revenge.  Justice?  Nope.  Immediate, bloody revenge.  Still, one cannot help but be mesmerized by the cinematography and exciting storyline which reminds us, once again, that Mexico City is not a nice place.  And despite what the critics of this film might say--hey, maybe they should go visit MC for awhile, not in the polished sections, but in the actual city, come back and leave a few comments.  If they survive, of course!<br /><br />This film starts out as a nightmarish descent into the psyche of a man of who has done very bad things during his life in the service of the U.S. Government, one of the chief flaws being that we never discover exactly what they were or why.  Hints are dropped but the theme of "redemption through finger flaying/anal tube bombs" would have worked out a lot better if we knew *who* John Creasy really was before the adorable little Dakota Fanning, daughter of a rich Mexican construction bigwig and a sort of blonde statue of a wife (Radha Mitchell was terrible in this movie, mechanical as Johnny Five with no voice) was kidnapped under his watch as drunk bodyguard.  The implications in these movies is that if someone was in the CIA, they must have monstrous MacGyver moves up their sleeves and a lot to regret.  I believe the former, since this was made during the reign of Bush/Cheney.<br /><br />When the girl is taken, what seems to be a straightforward tale of vengeance veers into something much more grisly and mysterious.  People are involved who definitely shouldn't be involved a la Jon Benet Ramsey.  This fuels Creasy's rage, as puzzles pop up (Mickey Rourke, one of the best actors out there today, helps make the movie playing the family's slimeball lawyer) which point in an unpleasant direction.<br /><br />Creasy's methods for extracting information are not bashful.  They seem expressly designed, in fact, to depersonalize their targets and rob them of their criminal pride, so bad are they.  Without screwing up the plot for anyone, though the "hidden ending" about the girl's welfare isn't too hard to understand, this is about a very capable man who feels as though his only reason for living, an innocent with joy the world has yet to take from her, is gone.  And worse.  What follows is a nightmare with a *tinge* of redemption.<br /><br />It succeeds.  Still, as a nation, we should sometimes wonder what it is that relishes revenge so much and not straight forward redemption.  It'd save us a lot of senseless wars.</p></body></html>

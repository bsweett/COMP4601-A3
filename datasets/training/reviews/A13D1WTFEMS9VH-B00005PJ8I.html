I want to comment on what seems to have been missed by virtually everyone who has seen the movie.<br /><br />There are TWO things that keep Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) going while on the deserted island: First, and most obviously, he is devoted to his fianc&eacute;. This gives him someone to hold onto in his heart as a reason to survive - and hope. His need for human companionship is demonstrated, of course, in his turning a volleyball - with his own blood as a marking pen - into a pal and fellow castaway with whom he can commiserate. But the other thing that is of no less importance to his will to survive is the Fed Ex package that he does NOT open. He is determined to do his job and deliver this package (though perhaps a bit late). It is this devotion to duty that ultimately leads him to his fateful encounter at the end of the movie. Thus, Zemeckis shows that by staying true to his inner voice, maintaining hope in impossible circumstances and seeing it through to the bitter end -- even though he could not possibly have known that this would lead him to happiness -- he winds up finding his true destiny after all.<br /><br />I loved it.</p></body></html>

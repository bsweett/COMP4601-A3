But somehow 'butterfly effect' succeeds in grabbing its audience... I guess it is the whole idea of playing with reality, an idea profound yet simple.. I agree in part with the criticism of this movie - it is far from perfect - but it is well worth watching - and I don't enjoy most hollywood films.. not great but good.</p></body></html>

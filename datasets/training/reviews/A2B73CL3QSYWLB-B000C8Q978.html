<meta name="summary" content="Quirky Does Not Necessarily Mean Funny"></head><body><p>I admire Bill Murray's choices as an actor which doesn't mean that I agree with them.  Instead of going for "Meatballs V" or "Ghostbusters III" Murray has sought out adventurous directors and interesting characters which doesn't equate to boffo box office.  With the exception of his work with Wes Anderson, though, most of his films miss the mark.  "Broken Flowers" is quirky without being humorous.  The central premise of a middle-aged lothario seeking out the possible mother of his son yields few laughs or insights.  You first have to buy into the idea of the taciturn Don Johnston(Murray) as some kind of Don Juan and it doesn't fly.  Director Jim Jarmusch seems to be more interested in the quirkiness of Johnston's past flames.  The women in Johnston's life are more caricature than character.  The most normal woman from Johnston's past is the biker chick (Tilda Swinton)and she's only dealt with perfunctorily.  The film's saving grace is a nice supporting turn by Jeffrey Wright as Johnston's buddy who fancies himself an amateur sleuth.</p></body></html>

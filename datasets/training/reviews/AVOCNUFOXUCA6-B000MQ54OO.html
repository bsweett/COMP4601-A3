<meta name="summary" content="Amiable, but that's about it"></head><body><p>"Happy Feet" is an amiable little movie, a slight good-natured bit of animation.  And the animation is spectacular, as review after review has attested.  The technical achievements of "Happy Feet" are noteworthy, including the sound.  If you have a subwoofer, it will get a workout during some scenes.<br /><br />But as review after review has also attested, there is no story here.  If you like plot, you will be sadly disappointed.  I turned to my wife at the 30 minute mark into the movie and said that I still didn't know what the story was, and she didn't either.  This movie may be good for very little kids, who will enjoy the animation and singing and dancing and don't have any demands or expectations about plot.  But, older children and adults are likely to be looking at their watches well before the ending wondering when this overly-long film will end.<br /><br />This is at least worth a rent for families with young children.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful fun..."></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg has finally returned to comedy... sort of. Based on a true story (and from what I hear, quite accurate), this film follows the life of a very young Frank Abagnale jr. who runs away from home and disguises himself as a pilot, then a doctor, then a lawyer, all in the course of two years. The FBI is following him, particularly Carl Handratty, who works in the fraud department and doesn't have much for a sense of humor. This film strays from the usual "based on a true story" inspirational dreck and instead creates a fun, fast pace. The film runs close to two and a half hours, but feels like a mere 70 minutes. DiCaprio is perfect as young Abagnale, Hanks is (as always) marvelous as Handratty, but the best performance in the film comes from Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr. Walken owns every scene he's in. He's absolutely brilliant. "Catch Me If You Can" is a very different film for Spielberg, but he shows once again that in the movie business, he's the very best.</p></body></html>

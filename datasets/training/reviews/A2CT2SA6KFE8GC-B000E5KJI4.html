Hollywood's big budget adaptation of The Illiad conveniently came out at a time when this kind of film is at it's high.  Parts of the book are randomly tossed out to keep the action going and the target audience happy.  Characters speak in a modernized English which is annoying.  In order to guarantee box office success, a big name actor is put in the starring role, even though they're not right for the part.  In this case Brad Pitt as Achilles.  I don't really have anything against Pitt, but he's no Achilles no matter what reviewers here might say.  Obviously they never read the book. How many of you have read The Illiad and thought to yourself, "Boy, wouldn't Brad Pitt make a great Achilles?"  Probably none of you.  If memory serves, Achilles is described as seven feet tall and four feet wide.  Not very Brad Pitt-like.  Personally I think Dolph Lundgren would make a pretty cool Achilles. That would never happen though coz he's not pretty or popular enough, though he'd do a better job.  Peter O'Toole is good as usual, so is Brian Cox.  Eric Bana is a decent Hector and Orlando Bloom has finally found a role that suits his talents-a whiney wuss.  For once CGI is used to good effect, making the battle scenes impressive.  All in all not a bad film, there is much worse out there.  Makes a great double feature with Caligula, but then again any film does.</p></body></html>

What I enjoyed about this film is the scenery and the elaborate storytelling. People seem to hate The Grudge but I think it is one of the better horror films I have seen in quite some time. There's not blood or guts, just a pure psychological thriller. I highly recommend checking The Grudge out. Too bad Bull Pullman can't pull off a decent performance, oh well.</p></body></html>

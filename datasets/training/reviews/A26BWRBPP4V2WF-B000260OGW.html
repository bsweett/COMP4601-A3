<meta name="summary" content="It's no "Dances With Wolves" but it's still pretty good"></head><body><p>I can't say that I'm much of a fan of Westerns.  I always thought Clint and Sergio's "Spaghetti Westerns" were kind of boring.  But I did enjoy "Dances With Wolves" and thought I should give this other Costner-helmed western a try.  The plot: Charley (Costner) and "Boss" (Robert Duvall) lead a set of 4 free-range cattlemen (and their dog) across the Prairie.  Because it's getting late in the day for the "old west," the land-owning big ranchers are starting to take over and they see the free-rangers as stealing their pasture (or, at least, their profits).  Boss and Charley cross paths with an especially rancourous rancher, which results in the death of one of Boss's men.<br /><br />At this point, it's difficult to describe the rest of the plot because it follows so naturally from the characters of Boss and Charley.  That they vow to get "justice" (not "revenge") on the rancher goes without saying.  The rest of the film exists as a storm brewing, building up to the final confrontation between the ranchers and Boss/Charley.  Added into the mix is the local doctor and his sister (who Charley develops feelings for).  The doctor is an interesting character, as he exists above (or perhaps outside) the heirarchy of the town - the marshall and the ranchers don't dare threaten him (not with death, anyways, as they would in a lesser film) because he is vital to the community.  Similarly, Charley and Boss know they can use his services.<br /><br />Although the gunfight is fairly standard, it is well-filmed (as is the movie in general) and maintains the viewer's interest.  The key to the film is, of course, the relationship between Boss and Charley, and it is one of the most convincing "buddy" relationships on film.  Unfortunately, there is a very unsatisfying denouement to the love story, and the end of the film drags on 15 minutes longer than needed.</p></body></html>

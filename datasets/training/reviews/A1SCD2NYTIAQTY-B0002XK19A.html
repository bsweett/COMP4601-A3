<meta name="summary" content="The Troubled Hero"></head><body><p>I will not review plot material that is already much-covered by other reviewers. I will add some simple comments about this movie.<br /><br />Firstly, the beginning of the movie seemed to dwell on the "troubled hero" issue for a very long time. While some of this was undoubtedly central to the character of Pete, I felt that it was dragged out for too long. It became somewhat monotonous in the end.<br /><br />However, once the action started, the movie really entered its own league. THe villian, Doc Ock, was awesome and well-played by Alfred Molina, bringing his own sense of internal conflict to the plot.<br /><br />The visual effects are astounding and greatly add to the overall feel of the movie. Also, as a minor point, the Editor provided some nice comic relief, as always. He was not uproariously funny, but he was amusing in his own stingy, opportunistic ways.<br /><br />Overall, a good film with some minor issues not mentioned. For a sequel, it is a good follow-on, and exceeded the first installment in the Spiderman saga.</p></body></html>

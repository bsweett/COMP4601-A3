<meta name="summary" content="Awesome retelling of the mythological classic!"></head><body><p>"Troy" gives viewers a visual masterpiece with stunning costumes, sets, cinematography, and breathtakingly choregraphed battle scenes. The world's greatest love story doesn't disappoint as two men vie for possession of the most beautiful woman in the world, and Brad Pitt gives a fabulous performance as well as a fab physique as the legendary hero. Maybe it's not entirely accurate or faithful to the original - but neither was Kevin Costner's "Robin Hood." Watch it for the spectacle and the great entertainment. A must-see!</p></body></html>

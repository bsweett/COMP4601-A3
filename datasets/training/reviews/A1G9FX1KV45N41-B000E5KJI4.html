<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant"></head><body><p>When Paris of Troy (Orlando Bloom) visits Sparta, he and the lovely  Queen Helen (played by that exquisite human being Diane Kruger - whose face certainly could launch a thousand ships)elope.<br />The problem is that she is the wife of the brutal King of Sparta, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson)<br />When he spirits Helen back with him to Troy, Menelaus vows revenge, including to tear Helen apart with his own hands. He is joined in preparing for war with Troy, by his worthless brother, Agamemnon, King of Greece, who sees an opportunity to expand his power and influence, and for plenty of plunder and riches.<br /><br />Under the leadership of Paris' father King Priam (Peter O'Toole) and his brother the heroic warrior Hector (Eric Bana), the Trojans put up a spirited and strong defense against the invading Greek armies. The champion of the Greeks is the invincible warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt), who hates Agamemnon, but his come to fight to immortalize his own name, in line with the prophecy by his seer mother.<br /><br />Brad Pitt did pull off his role as Achilles, though I was skeptical whether he would BEFORE the movie.<br />Though he was not as good as Eric Bana in his superb and thoughtful portrayal of Hector.<br />Three notable roles by three beautiful women. As already mentioned the gorgeous Diane Kruger as Helen of Troy, Saffron Burrows as Hector's regal wife Andromache, and Rose Burn as the pretty priestess, Briseis.<br /><br />The acting is superb, the setting majestic, the battle scenes brilliant.<br />I honestly don't know what the critics of this movie want. I don't think it could have been done better.<br /><br />Also this was NOT meant to be The Iliad itself, it was meant to be a realistic portrayal of the Trojan War as it might have been, and it was done superbly.<br />There was literally never a dull moment in the whole movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="To predictable."></head><body><p>Typical film for this suspense mystery genre. Nothing special here except for an outstanding preformance by Robin Williams. Not a complete waste of time. It's a great flick to watch on a rainy day, just don't expect anything different. There's nothing new under the sun, therefore it's all been done before. I'd just like to see it executed originally for a change.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="disappointing entry from Lee"></head><body><p>**1/2<br /><br />Spike Lee's "Inside Man" is probably the most commercially viable and least cutting-edge film the maverick director has ever made.  I wouldn't exactly call it a sellout - Lee is as entitled as anyone else to make money off his projects - but it is a bit disheartening seeing Lee aiming his sights and his estimable talents as low as he has here.<br /><br />"Inside Man" starts out like a dozen other bank robbery tales, with a gang of masked gunmen storming into the establishment and turning the terrified customers and employees into ready-made hostages, then hunkering down for a prolonged standoff with the law enforcement officials outside.  Denzel Washington plays the hostage negotiator whose job it is to bring the perpetrators to justice with a minimal loss of innocent life.<br /><br />The movie deserves credit for bringing a few novel twists to the storyline, but, frankly, most of what happens in this film simply defies credibility.  We don't believe for a moment the goings-on here. Despite a "surprise" ending and a plethora of Lee's trademark cinematic flourishes, we leave the movie shrugging our shoulders uttering, "Is that all there is?"<br /><br />Washington does the best he can with a halfheartedly written character, but Clive Owen, Willem Dafoe and the ubiquitous Christopher Plummer aren't given much to do in their various roles.  Only Jodie Foster - playing a ruthless real estate agent inexplicably brought in to assist in the case - seems to be having any fun at all with the film.  She brings a much needed note of high-spirited camp to a movie that really doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.<br /><br />"Dog Day Afternoon" this ain't.</p></body></html>

It definately is exciting, the action is intense and the special effects are truly something to be seen (examples that come to mind are Davy Jones' tentacle face, the sea monster called the Kraken when it attacks ships in the open sea, and when Davy Jones' ship dives underwater) Some may not like the ending as a cliffhanger, but I found it a great way to lead into the third and (hopefully not) the final movie of this great story.<br /><br />Johnny Depp returns as the charming, yet off his rocker pirate known as Jack Sparrow. He has a life debt to the mysterious and deadly Davy Jones and cannot sail out in the open sea for fear of Davy Jones's sea monster, the Kraken, eating him and his ship The Black Pearl. Desperate to stay one step ahead of Davy Jones and his damned crew of sailors, Sparrow heads toward dry land.<br /><br />Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley return as well as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann who are about to be married. However they are roped into finding Jack Sparrow as Will sets off to bring back Jack's broken compass to Cutler Beckett, a powerful and ruthless EITC agent who arrests Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner shortly before their wedding. They were arrested because they helped Jack Sparrow escape hanging in the previous film, and after being arrested Will makes a deal with Beckett who wants Sparrow's compass.<br /><br />The whole movie is about a giant cat and mouse game with plenty of humor sewn in between to bring it all together. Johnny Depp once again steals the spotlight as Jack Sparrow, and Davy Jones is another great treat to watch in this movie from his tencle face all the way down to his walk that he does as he paces back and forth in front of his crew.<br /><br />The action is spectacular but really far fetched in some places (an example that comes to mind is a three way sword fight on top of a rolling wind mill) not to mention a scene where the Kraken attacks the Black Pearl, but it is exciting just to watch. I actually went back the second the fight scene was over and watched it all over again!<br /><br />Extras include:<br /><br />Behind the scenes look at the entire movie<br /><br />director's commentary<br /><br />deleted scenes<br /><br />the making of Dead Man's Chest<br /><br />and much more!<br /><br />Anyways this is one movie that is awesome to see. Some may not find it as good as The Curse of the Black Pearl, but this is definately a good way to keep the entertainment at an all time high! recommended</p></body></html>

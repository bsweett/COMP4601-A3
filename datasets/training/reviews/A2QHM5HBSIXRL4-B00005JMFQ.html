<meta name="summary" content="The Curtis pedigree wins out...Love + Politicking, too"></head><body><p>If you're on the fence about seeing 'Love Actually,' perhaps you're not aware of the pedigree of writer/director Richard Curtis.  He's been the guiding hand - in one way or another - behind a remarkable string of movies...Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones' Diary (and the upcoming sequel to that).  Plus, as long-time collaborator with Rowan Atkinson (the various incarnations of 'Mr. Bean' on small- and big-screens), the guy knows how to stage physcial comedy.<p>So, it's no surprise that 'Love Actually' is (mostly) a triumph.  There's a lot going on here; some of the stories are stronger than others, most notably the tale of married couple Alan Rickman (fantastic here) and Emma Thompson (who is looking more and more like Hillary Clinton with each passing day).  There's a brilliant bit of serious acting here by Thompson locked away by herself in her bedroom.  Grade A stuff.<p>From a comedic standpoint, the movie is absolutely stolen by the incredibly gifted Bill Nighy as 'wrinkled rocker' Billy Mack.  If you've never seen Nighy do his schtick (check out his over-the-top performance in "Still Crazy"), you're in for a real treat.  Plus, his holiday rendition of "Love Is All Around" sets the tone of the movie from the opening scene.  It pops up over and over and never wears thin.<p>Hugh Grant is the surprise here as a Blair-like British PM (without the Cheri).  I know he can do the serious stuff.  Check out his sublime performance in 'About a Boy' - the bumbling, stuttering Grant persona is nowhere to be found.  The eye-openers here are twofold:<p>First, Grant was quoted during "Two Weeks Notice" that he "doesn't do physical comedy," and would leave that to 'Two Weeks' co-star Sandra Bullock (the best physical comedienne in film today).  However, here he is shaking his booty through the halls of No. 10 Downing St. to the Pointer Sisters' "Jump."  It's quite good stuff.  Grant has sold himself short all these years.<p>Second, there's this one bit of politicking that Curtis slides into the movie.  Grant meets with the US President (Billy Bob Thornton is a stellar cameo in which he oligeneously combines the worst qualities of Bush and Clinton).  Expected to parrot the U.S. line in a press conference, Grant ferociously blurts out a statement of independence.  Curtis' less the veiled intent here:  "Message to Tony Blair; don't be anyone's poodle any longer."  Frankly, the only way this scene works is via Grant's ability to deliver those lines and have it seem credible.  He does that.  You never doubt him for an instant.  For anyone with an interest in the U.S.-Britain 'special relationship,' this scene alone makes 'Love Actually' worth checking out.  It'll spark hours of conversation.</p></body></html>

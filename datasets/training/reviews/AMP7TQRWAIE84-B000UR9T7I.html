Spider-Man finally gets the girl, thinks about marriage and seems overall happier. He and Mary J. get in a fight in the beginning because she accuses Peter of being insensitive to her Broadway performance critique. Their relationship is kinda up and down throughout. Some really shocking things happen during the course of the movie and it must be known that of all 3 of the movies with McQuire portraying Parker this has the most depth; an intriguing depth that the other two lack. But let me tell you; the trilogy of Spider-Man went out with a serious bang with this movie. It might not be perfect but as far as the series goes it's an all-time high. The action was really good and I disagree when I hear people say that three enemies was too much. Finally, the last few scenes rocked! They were very emotive and if you're sensitive, prepare for some tears.<br /><br />Now I know many have said that there were some issues with this movie but I didn't find too many. It gets really intense at times and you just feel for the characters involved but it really works in the movie's favor. There were also more than a couple of totally light-hearted scenese that balance the more serious matters at hand (Peter's raggedy apartment door, anyone??). This is definitely my favorite superhero movie of all-time after watching it again today (10/11/12). I can't believe I haven't been re-watching it over and over again as it is way better than some have let on. I say if you have any doubts about the series and haven't seen any because you've been put off for any reason, you owe it to yourself to watch one Spider-Man title -- and you'd make the right choice if this was it!<br /><br />4.75 stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A True Horror Movie"></head><body><p>If you are looking for a scary movie that wraps everything up nicely at the end with a feeling of hope, don't watch this movie. If you want to see a scary movie that sticks true to itself until the very end, this is the movie for you. I have never seen a movie so pure in it's genre. There is no happy ending here and why should there be? The movie's ending is different than the book, but I was so happy to see that the new ending is just as evil and insane as the rest of the movie. Frankly, I was shocked and surprised. This is a great story about a group of people trapped in a grocery store after a mist rolls in and covers the place. What's lurking in the mist is pure evil and the suspense will keep you barely able to breath. The acting is great, the special effects are awesome, but what sets this movie apart for me is the ending. One of the best horror films I have ever seen, top 3 of all time, but make sure you go into this movie expecting a pure horror movie complete with a horrific ending. If you want to watch insanity unfold, you should step into The Mist.</p></body></html>

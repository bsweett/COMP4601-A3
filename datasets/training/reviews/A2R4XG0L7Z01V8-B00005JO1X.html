How freaky."></head><body><p>I loved the books when I was young, and still read them to this very day, despite being an early 20-something now. Before I could read, my Dad read them to me, putting on silly voices, before I got fed up and learned to read, so I could make up my own voices as I went along. They were one of the first books I seriously got into, long before the Harry Potters of today. This is an instant classic. I never really understood it as a child, as I've grown older I've perhaps understood little bits here & there, but everytime I read the books now, I discover something new. Like today, I discovered I'd been reading them the 'wrong' way the whole time. I've got them in one big book, and it runs The Magician's Nephew, The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe, The Horse & His Boy (the worst in my opinion) Prince Caspian, The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader The Silver Chair & The Last Battle. I always knew The Magician's Nephew was a prequel, but I've always read it first. But I didn't know The Horse & His Boy was a prequel too! The running order (as they were originally published back in the good old days) should go: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse and His Boy, The Magician's Nephew & The Last Battle.<br /><br />I was actually nervous about watching this film beforehand. I never got to see it at the cinema - due to it being released before Christmas and I work in a card shop - so I had to wait til it was released on DVD, and then had to wait longer as it was a birthday present. And then when I'd worked myself up about watching it, I fell asleep half an hour into it. (But through tiredness, not due it being boring.)<br /><br />Why was I was nervous about watching it? In the late 80s, The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe, Prince Caspian & The Voyage of The Dawn Treader & The Silver Chair were was actually filmed in the UK for children's TV. It was released on DVD a while ago, and it was really, REALLY bad. The young actors were nothing how I imagined them to look, the actress playing Lucy had the most awful teeth, the special effects were shockingly bad - but probably terrific for that time - and to this day, I've still never watched it all. And probably never will.<br /><br />Back to the review.<br /><br />I couldn't stay up long enough to watch all of it in one go, so carried on the following night, and found myself getting completely sucked in. It just totally came to life in my eyes, and everything was the way I remembered it. Sure, there were a couple of extra little scenes added in here & there, but only a dedicated reader would have known most of them, and they added to the film, rather than detracted. I was disappointed that some of Mr & Mrs Beaver's best lines were taken out, and Liam Neeson being the voice of Aslan just didn't work for me.<br /><br />The actors of Peter, Susan, Edmund & Lucy were terrific too, although I never liked Susan's character in the books, and found myself hating her in this. Thankfully, Susan & Peter never really feature that much in the books, they grow up, and get too "old" to believe in Narnia, so the younger ones feature much more. I wasn't keen on Tilda Swinton as The White Witch. She was very tall wasn't she? The image on screen just didn't match the image in my head. I felt myself completely sucked into the world of Narnia, and although there some slight quibbles from my Dad (having seen it) about how some things were similar to The Lord Of The Rings, and I did want to shout out "Freedom!" during the big battle scene, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Totally unexpected.<br /><br />Will I be watching this again? Most definitely. I was almost in tears, it matched what was in my head nearly perfectly. I just hope it continues throughout the rest of the films (as all books have been optioned), and doesn't go bad in some, like the Harry Potters. I don't think I can wait until 2007 for Prince Caspian. I'll definitely go to the cinema for the rest of them!!!<br /><br />Keep watching after the credits for a 30 second clip, featuring a little bit more of Jim Broadbent as the Professor.</p></body></html>

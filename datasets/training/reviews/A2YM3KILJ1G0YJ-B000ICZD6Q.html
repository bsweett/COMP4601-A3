If not that, then the movie is an obvious homage to something so outlandish that it's not to be taken realistically.  In Good Company, however, takes the opposite approach, showing genuine familial, work, and romantic relationships.  With nearly no twists or surprises, almost no exaggeration whatsoever, this movie delivers as intended.<br /><br />Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) is the director of marketing for a company being purchased by a multination conglomerate.  Corporate restructuring brings about the obvious changes.  As a result, most of Dan's team is fired, and his position is usurped by Carter Duryea (Topher Grace) - as the young, brash, conceited yet overmatched, buzz-word spouting whiz-kid - making Dan the second fiddle.  Just like a formulaic black-white movie, where the white character inevitably learns to dance from the black character, Carter soon learns from the wiser, experienced, and worldly sage of marketing.  Just think of Dan as Miyagi and Carter as Daniel-San; it only takes one good butt-kicking, literally in this movie, to realize how incompetent and unprepared you are when faced with an experienced adversary.<br /><br />When Carter meets Dan's georgous, college-bound daughter Alex (Scarlett Johansson), sparks fly, adding yet another juxtaposed subplot amidst the struggles of life, love, and corporate advancement.<br /><br />Overall it's a decent, albeit predictable, somewhat bland movie that if nothing more, provides a reason to ogle Johansson and see Quaid turn in a great performance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is for those who want their grams back..."></head><body><p>This was an extremely moving film that pulls no punches yet beautifully avoids passing judgment.  Del Toro is Jack Jordan, a seemingly normal guy who commits a most horrific crime - in a hit and run, he kills a man and his two daughters, condemning Cristina (Naomi Watts), a mother and wife to a life of endless grief and hatred.  Separated, Jack and Cristina endure a living death.  Guilt-ridden Jack will consign himself to prison and find religion an apt avenue for suicide.  Cristina, it turns out, had an especially unstable life before being settled down by marriage, and with her family gone, turns back to chemical bereavement counseling.  Jack wants nothing more than punishment, and Cristina is all too ready to satisfy Jack's need.<br /><br />And then there's Paul, the man who finally brings the two of them together.  A mathematician with a terminal heart, condition and a marriage to match, Paul receives Cristina's husband's heart, and then court her.  Paul thinks himself a hero, doubtless, taking Cristina out for lunch, driving her home from clubs when she's had one-too-many.  But Cristina has an influence on Paul as well - a negative one.<br /><br />This flick charts the emotional rollercoaster of Jack, Paul and Cristina's lives.  The film plays out of chronological sequence, but hardly out of order.  Like a ride, it has its fast moments and its slow ones, milking the maximum emotional velocity by playing its scenes to a climax before returning to an earlier point in the story.  The effect is at times incomprehensible but also unforgettable.  Suffice it to say, this is the perfect movie for people who like to see the same movie more than once.  In a voice-over, the title supposedly refers to a theory that the human soul weighs 21 grams.  This is the story of those who got their grams back.</p></body></html>

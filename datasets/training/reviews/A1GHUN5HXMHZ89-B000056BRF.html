<meta name="summary" content="One in a Thousand"></head><body><p>Since my birth in 1951 I have seen probably at least a thousand movies. This one is the best. If I was told I could only have one movie to take with me on a desert island, in space, etc. this would have to be it. As so many people have said it's the compilation of so many things that make it outstanding. The acting is super. No doubt in my mind this was Hestons best work. The effects have aged well. I dare anyone to find fault with a chariot race or a sea battle for that matter that even today make us believe they could have been filmed as they occured in ancient Roman times. Althouth I love the music from Gladiator, Star Wars, and others I still think that more emotions are touched by Ben Hur's musical score. I have to assume we are telling you kids to see this because any adult that has not seen it and loved it had to be on an island with no TVs for about 40 years.</p></body></html>

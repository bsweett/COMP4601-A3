Maybe that's because of the brilliant cinematography, the engaging set pieces, the surprisingly emotional performances, and twisty storytelling that propels the film.  Jet Li, who it is great to see in a film of this type without a hip-hop soundtrack or a team-up with DMX, plays Nameless: a mysterious warrior claiming to have defeated three warriors who had intended to assassinate the reigning King of Qin.  As the story unfolds, twists are abound, as Nameless recalls the events, and the King gives his own interpretation.  The fight scenes are exceptionally done, even though there are plenty who will find them redundant, overdone, and possibly even drawn out or boring.  Hero isn't a film for pure action junkies who love American Jet Li flicks like Kiss of the Dragon or Romeo Must Die, but it would do them well to see this and keep an open mind.  Beautifully executed, Hero is a smash.</p></body></html>

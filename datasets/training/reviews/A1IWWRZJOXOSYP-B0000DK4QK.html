The DVD version offers over 20 deleted scenes with the parts leading to them and came after that were included in the film being in black & white, with the deleted scenes in color.  This was a nice touch.  I enjoyed the delted scene with the detectives running about with flashlights.  My wife said, "Did they have flashlights back then?"  I said, "That's probably why they deleted it!"  <p>The acting in the film was very good.  Depp turns in his usual magical performance, always letting us sense a depth to the surface action.  Robbie Coltrane as the sidekick cop Peter Godley was appropriately loyal.  One of the deleted scenes in the library showed a great personal devotion which was a nice touch.  Heather Graham as Mary Kelly didn't look like life had been hard on her, other than having to wear a slightly soiled costume, but was a great love interest.  My favorite was Susan Lynch who bowled me over as Mrs. James Joyce in "Nora."  Here she plays the lesbian hooker Liz Stride with appropriate pluck.  Ian Holm as Sir William Gull did surprise me with his change at the end.  All in all, the sets are stunning, the story good, acting superb.  Not one to watch with your kids around, however...  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</p></body></html>

The sensitivity required of the writer when scripting a film for a young audience requires particular subtlety in dealing with darker and more adult themes. Add to this the factor that adults are more likely to take their children to see films that they themselves will find entertaining, the writer's task becomes dual in nature. How to make a film satisfy the simplistic narrative requirements of a child, while also satisfying the complex narrative requirements of the adult? Pixar has somehow been able to consistently answer this challenge while putting to shame the quality of writing for strictly adult oriented movies.<br /><br />Highlights included for me:<br /><br />Programmable military jarhead Buzz Lightyear having stick removed from his proverbial blackhole when on "Spanish mode" was funny.<br />The evil bear NOT being redeemed because some people are just bad and that's life.<br />The moment when they're like all going to die and they hold hands and accept their fate was touching. Ken...haaahaaa. Barbie's boyfriend(?) Ken voiced by -I didn't know it while watching- Micheal Keaton. I saw Ken described as a "dandified twit". Hopefully for Barbie he likes girls because it isn't clear that he isn't, ya know. Well I guess that doesn't matter too much since he doesn't have.... and oh yeah their freakin' toys. I almost forgot because the writing is THAT good. You believe in the characters like they're "real".<br />Anyway, Jim Varney is dead and so couldn't voice the Slinky Dog I noticed.<br /><br />The ending of the film did elicit an emotional response from me and that also had to do with the fact that I recall when the first Toy Story came out and I was working at a Burger King and they were selling Buzz Lightyears, Woodys, etc. and that was a longtime ago. The kid in the movie was just a little kid then and now he's off to college like cousins of mine and I feel old. Life is short.</p></body></html>

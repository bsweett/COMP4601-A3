Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- June 24th, 2005<br /><br />Running Time- 93-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Writer/Director- George A. Romero<br /><br />Starring- Simon Baker, John Leguizamo, Asia Argento, Robert Joy, Eugene Clark and Dennis Hopper as Kaufman<br /><br />After 20-years George Romero returns to the zombie flick a type of film that Romero is the godfather of. After the success of Night of the Living Dead the zombie film was changed forever and after Dawn of the Dead it changed again. Every zombie flick since those two pretty much follow their concept with others following Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 and sometimes filmmakers mixing both Romero and Fulci together. Upon its initial release Day of the Dead wasn't highly received among fans, but over the years has gotten a lot more respect by people who originally dismissed it and not long after the release of Day of the Dead zombie flicks would start to die out and by the late 80s they were all, but dead and the ones made were hardly making an impact and than through most of the 90s zombie flicks were of something of a distant memory.<br /><br />For years George Romero wanted to make another zombie flick, but no one really seemed interested in producing it. But with the success of movies such as Resident Evil, Shaun of the Dead and the remake of Dawn of the Dead, George Romero finally got the chance to make his follow up to Day of the Dead and this was something fans have been waiting for, but started to doubt it would ever happen. But finally Land of the Dead came about and fan expectations were quite high for it. Regardless of if you like or dislike Romero's Dead flicks nobody can deny the impact they made on the horror genre.<br /><br />In my opinion Land of the Dead easily will go down as one of the best zombie flicks of the decade and quite honestly the only zombie movie of the decade that might be better is the remake of Dawn of the Dead, but I suppose it depends what you are looking for. I don't think Land of the Dead is as good as the previous 3 Dead flicks, but it is on par with them and makes for a great thrill ride. Though I have to be in the right mood for this one; my first viewing was in cinemas and I've never seen a Romero Dead film theatrically. Being born in 1979 I missed out on the first two and Day of the Dead wasn't playing near me. So I was so excited that I would have enjoyed this movie no matter what. My 2nd viewing on DVD I wasn't as into it and my 3rd viewing I loved it like I did when I first saw it. So as much as I love Land of the Dead this is the kinda movie that I have to be in the right mood to enjoy.<br /><br />The screenplay by George Romero is very well written and that's one area I feel he doesn't get enough credit. As a director he's one of the greats of the genre and not just that, but his movies aren't just great horror movies, but great movies. But as a writer he always had interesting and well developed characters with plenty of depth. The characters we were meant to like we did and rooted for them and the characters we disliked we did and wanted to see them get what's coming to them. The script for Land of the Dead continues with that and again Romero created some excellent characters and some are just as solid as any of Romero's past characters even if most fans overlook that in this one.<br /><br />As excellent as the script is not everything works; in each Dead flick the zombies have evolved and in Land of the Dead they have evolved even more. Big Daddy played by Eugene Clark was different than any other zombie in the series. Big Daddy was a little too smart for my liking and while I suppose you can also make that case for Bub in Day of the Dead I felt it worked a lot better in Day than it did in Land. Big Daddy also showed a lot of emotion and for me that was the only drawback in what was an excellent screenplay. It's an idea that is no doubt interesting, but in my opinion it just didn't fully work for me, but as other people really liked that aspect of the film so keep that in mind.<br /><br />Again I have to say that Romero really is a great writer and most people never really seem to talk about that. Some of the most memorable characters in the horror genre are characters from a Romero movie. What I like about his characters that even the heroes aren't perfect and are often flawed. Not every character in a movie can be developed, but Romero always manages to get the job done and as great as a director he's also such an amazing writer. And the fact he wrote a movie that is still relevant in today's times is amazing. Most filmmakers lose touch, but with at least Land of the Dead George Romero was still in touch with what's going on.<br /><br />37-years after his debut film Night of the Living Dead, George Romero still managed to put together an excellent flick. Most filmmakers from Romero's era have since faded away the only filmmaker from that era still making movies just as good if not better is David Cronenberg. Horror filmmakers in general seem to decline the most and Romero showed no signs of that with Land of the Dead. The pacing is excellent and there really isn't a slow moment to be found. The story always moves forward each scene with plot, character development or suspense. There's a few more jump scares than the past Dead flicks, but Romero works it well and manages to get a few good jump scenes and is able to deliver some good suspense and tension. Land of the Dead might lack in that area compared to the previous Dead movies, but Romero works it well and delivers a very solid movie. The final act though really delivers big time and Romero delivers some really exciting and tense scenes.<br /><br />When you look at the filmmakers from Romero's era like Carpenter or Argento these guys aren't making the films they once did. And while they still might craft a fun movie it's far inferior to their earlier work, but George Romero was able to avoid that trend and make a movie just as solid as anything he's done in his prime. While Land of the Dead isn't his best movie it does stand proud next to his body of work.<br /><br />The performances were all strong with Simon Baker, Robert Joy and John Leguizamo the best of the lot. Dennis Hopper delivers his best performance in years and the always lovely Asia Argento also provides a strong performance. Simon Baker as Riley and Robert Joy as Charlie are two of the best characters from the Dead series and Leguizamo as Cholo is a complex character that you'll love and hate.<br /><br />The gore by Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger is excellent; there's also some CGI used, but it works well. It's not overused and the way it was shot it actually looks good. I hate CGI in general, but when not overused and shot the right way it can be effective and the CG works well here and the gore F/X by Nicotero and Berger are some of the best of their career. Some people were upset that Tom Savini didn't do the gore F/X Savini of course did the gore in Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead and would have done Night of the Living Dead, but he had to go to Vietnam. But Nicotero and Berger is every bit as good as Savini and do a bang up job.<br /><br />Land of the Dead was more than worth the wait and while you can't please everybody I felt Romero really got the job done and made another great movie in a legendary career. This was the last of the Dead series as Diary of the Dead would start a new Dead franchise. Also keep a look out for Shaun of the Dead star Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright in cameos and Tom Savini reprises his character from Dawn of the Dead.</p></body></html>

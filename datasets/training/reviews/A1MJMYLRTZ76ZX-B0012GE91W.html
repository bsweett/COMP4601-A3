<meta name="summary" content="A brief comment"></head><body><p>Since there are already over 600 reviews of this movie I'll just keep my comments brief and touch on a few points that I wanted to discuss.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie overall but I have to say that it's the weakest and most problematic of all the Harry Potter movies, although it's not without some great high points, too. I note that many of the fans were disappointed in how much was cut from the original book, making the story arc somewhat disjointed and hard to follow. But then this was the longest, if I remember right, of all the Harry Potter novels and you just can't cram everything in even a modest sized book, let alone one this long, into a movie. But many characters who featured prominently in the book get very little screen time in this adaptation.<br /><br />But the movie does have its good points. The best thing is how you get to see the young wizards growing in their magic skills as they learn to do magical tricks like discharge energy, repulse an attacker by knocking him back through the air, perform stunts similar to psychokinesis by manipulating objects from afar, and so on. This aspect of the movie is the most fun.<br /><br />The problem is that there's a new, evil senior professor by the name of Ms. Umbridge who is almost bad enough to bring the whole movie screeching to a halt every time she appears. She will only teach the young magicians the theory, not the actual practical techniques of magic. This puts the students in a bind, because they still need to protect themselves from evil magicians like Voldemor and also pass their exams. There's also no explanation in the movie for this inexplicable policy of Umbridge's except she's a very bad person. But the young people show some grit and determination in their desire to learn no matter who or what gets in their way by forming an outside study group, which meets in secret to learn what they can on their own.<br /><br />But Umbridge is such a low, despicable character that the whole move suffers as a result. Not the least of these problems is that she runs around with a rigid, unchanging rictus of an expression on her face that's sort of like smug, arrogant complacency combined with a somewhat pinched, pained grimace as if she has terminal hemorrhoids. It's too extreme an affectation and caricature and makes every scene with this character hard to watch. I don't think I've ever had a more negative reaction to a character in a movie, and I usually don't even have much of a reaction to characters in movies. But her whole persona is an embarrassingly bad idea and low point for what was already a problematic Harry Potter movie. The only good thing you can say about the Umbridge character  is at least the name was a clever idea because of the allusion to the word, "umbrage." Well, I guess I take umbrage with Ms. Umbridge.<br /><br />Although there are some fun and enjoyable parts to the movie, and I still enjoyed it for the most part, again, the movie suffers from some bad characterization, a patchy and difficult to follow plot, and the loss of some important story elements from the book. It seems now that the Harry Potter kids are almost grown-up teenagers the Hogwarts Academy has lost its warts and gotten a bad case of acne. I still enjoyed the movie for the most part but in comparison with the other great movies in this series I can only give this one three stars at most.</p></body></html>

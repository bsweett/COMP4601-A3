<meta name="summary" content="A movie worth watching"></head><body><p>Lord of War sheds light (as it should do) on the reality of international arms dealing and its consequences worldwide.  More importantly it does a good job of showing who is, more often than not, behind the various plots, schemes, and wars, not to mention how corrupt the world has become.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.<br /><br />The major setbacks are in relation to:<br /><br />1) The main character's wife who never asks/does not care what her husband does for a living... Give me a break!<br /><br />2) The weak beginning with the retarded father.  What was the point?<br /><br />Apart from that, the plot, the setting, and the music are good enough.<br /><br />Though not a masterpiece, it is indeed an interesting film that will provide for an evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

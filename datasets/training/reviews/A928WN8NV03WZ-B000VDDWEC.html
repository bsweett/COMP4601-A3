<meta name="summary" content="good, not great, but pretty good"></head><body><p>I was hoping for a lot from this Movie, Danny Boyle is behind a few gems, Trainspotting and Shallow Grave are classics.  But like so many directors, he fell flat once gaining acceptance in the mainstream USA audience, big budgets hindering him more than anything.  This movie wasn't as good as I had hoped, but it was still entertaining and fun to watch.<p>Most interesting is the beginning before you know what is really happening, some people get infected, a scientist freaks out about it, and the opening credits roll.  Then you are brought to the main character, who has been in a coma from a bicycle crash.  He wakes up in an empty hospital, and walks out into a seeminly deserted london.  When he discovers that a plague has decimated or changed most of the town.<p>One thing to note, this isn't as much a zombie movie as it was hyped up to be.  The infected weren't dead, they got the disease and became like rabid animals.  Second, you don't see them as much as you would expect.  This is nice since it keeps them fresh and you don't see a lot of them till later in the movie.  They are also really fast, appearing sometimes out of nowhere and charging like mad for those who haven't been infected.<p>This is more like the earlier Romereo flicks, more about how people react to the desolation of their society and danger of their surroundings; the hardened survivalist that will kill you without blinking if you show signs of infection, the kind father who wants to get his daughter to safety and seems to be almost unaffected by events around him, or the degenerated soldiers.<p>It could have been better, but I think that it was better than a lot of horror movies of late, and hope for future movies from Danny Boyle.  Hopefully a sign that he will return to the former caliber of his early films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is a true Kubrick film."></head><body><p>&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is a very hard film for me to sit through. There is brilliance in just about every nuance of its story, in every masterful shot, in the superb direction of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who makes his presence known throughout the movie with his unique techniques of camera movement and cinematography. The story has little to be desired in terms of complexity and movement, which is subtly suspenseful and very poignant. But there are some aspects of the movie that cannot be passed by, like the film's gratuitous amount of nudity and sexual practice. But still, the movie has a lot to offer. <p>Kubrick begins this fascinating film by introducing us to William (Bill) Harford, a gynecologist, and his wife Alice. They are an upper-crust couple with a daughter living in New York City, and our first glimpses of their life seem perfectly normal and undemanding. Kubrick even goes so far as to show us their commitment to one another by putting them into several risque situations during a party scene in the first act. Alice drunkenly dances the night away with a total stranger, who keeps trying to persuade her to run away with him, while Bill is set upon by two women who are obviously doing more than making simple conversation. <p>The spin on their fairy tale marriage comes the night after the party, as Alice and Bill share a joint in their room. Alice brings up the two girls at the party, which Bill counters with her waltzes with the unknown man. Alice becomes antagonized by his opinions on women and the trust in their marriage, and reveals to him a sexual longing she once held for someone else in the beginning of their marriage. Bill is upset by this, and finds an excuse to leave when he is called away to visit a deceased patient. Thus begins an intense foray of extensive eroticism and sexual temptation that threatens to destroy their marriage and Bill's life. <p>The movie walks a fine line between fantasy and reality. Upon hearing his wife's admissions, Bill becomes plagued by dream-like visions of his wife's fantasy. It is these vivid pictures of his mind that drive him to the edge of fidelity, as he will later meet a hooker, attend a party which looks like something straight from the &quot;Kama Sutra,&quot; and find himself trapped in a web of deception among those he thinks are his friends as well as with himself. Kubrick masters Bill's subconscious by revealing a small piece at a time, leading up to the last full, shocking image of his wife's &quot;infidelity.&quot; These are small, shocking cuts, but remain important in the advancement of the character's mind. <p>Kubrick keeps the pacing well-timed and subtle, keeping the suspense at bay until the final moments when all the secrets are revealed. Attention is critical in watching this movie: there is a lot to miss by not giving your full attention to particular scenes. Each sequence plays a crucial role of some sort, whether it be an advancement of the plot or some small secret leading up to the big finish. <p>And what a finish it is. The movie is a milestone in creating a sense of high tension without ever going overboard on the suspense. Kubrick balances the physical and outer aspects of suspense with the inner tension of Bill's mind quite well, never losing focus of the point he is trying to make through this story. The ending is very satisfactory, one of those that ties everything together before finishing itself off in the last fade-out. All of the plot points you thought were useless and unnecessary come to light in a climax that is truly inspired and relieving. <p>Every nuance of this movie practically screams &quot;Kubrick!&quot; His attention to details and his grace in filming keep this film on par with his other films. I recognized his tracking shots, such as those of people walking down hallways, from his film &quot;The Shining.&quot; This is perhaps the most stand-out feature of his career, and one he is most noted for. His use of color and light imagery are also very fervent. His characters are cast in lights that make them look pale and death-like, while the surrounding colors of the set pieces and the streets are branded with vivid hues and tones. And the images are quite shocking, to say the very least, some of the most shocking I've ever seen in a movie. <p>Which leads me to wonder, was it really THAT necessary to have so much gratuitous sexual scenes spread throughout the plot? I know that Kubrick likes to shock his audiences with images sometimes,... but the graphic display of the party scenes seems to be a bit of a wandering from what the movie is all about. There's an old saying that goes, &quot;Less is more.&quot; The movie would do a lot better in following this adage, instead of showing all the goods. <p>The performances at the front of this motion picture are helmed gloriously by real-life couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who play the married couple qith ease and extravagance (not like they needed any coaching or anything). Cruise is composed yet torn apart inside, barely showing emotion until he cannot hold it in any longer. Kidman's performance is both moving and disappointing at times. I found her confrontations with Bill about her fantasy to be quite disturbing and beautifully mastered, but in her revelation of a dream she had been having, her sobs seemed a bit forced and unconvincing. But, looking past all that, these two actors have a bravura talent that presents itself beautifully onscreen. And what about that chemistry? <p>Rounding things out, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is an inspired and mesmerizing look at fidelity, the mind, and emotion. Kubrick's masterful storytelling and filming techniques shine out in this, his final project, standing out as a truly brilliant achievement in movie-making. Pick it apart, and you'll find that there is more to this movie than what you see on its cover.</p></body></html>

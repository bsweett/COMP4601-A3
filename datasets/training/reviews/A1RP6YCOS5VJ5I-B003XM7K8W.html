<meta name="summary" content="Great Willis Action Movie"></head><body><p>Wow. Right from the start of the movie, this movie is simply amazing. Even from the first scene when Bruce has to rescue a boy and the child's mom from a crazy man and it doesn't end so pleasantly. Everyone in this film is excellent. You really hate the bad guys of this movie and want them to get arrested or worse so badly. That means that these actors are really great to pull that emotion out of someone watching. It shows that there are young actors in Hollywood that can act. Willis is gives a great performance, as usual, as the hero of the film. The only downside to this movie is that it does have a couple of slow parts, but not many. Recommended to Bruce Willis fans for sure</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than the first?"></head><body><p>A director who always stars in his own movies?  The last time we had this successful combo was Alfred Hitchcock.  Lately, we have Jon Favreau and his Iron Man movies.  Based on the Marvel Comics and starring his friend Robert Downey Junior, Iron Man 1 and 2 were box office successes and rated well with critics.  This 2nd installation takes of where the first one ended, and employs the same comedy, sarcasm, action style, and main characters as the first one, though with different villians of course.  And in this movie, the romance between Iron Man and his secretary / assistant leads to their first kiss.  As usual, the special effects are great, the story is original, the plot keeps the audience on their toes, and we have the SHIELD organization lurking in the background.  All told, a great movie.</p></body></html>

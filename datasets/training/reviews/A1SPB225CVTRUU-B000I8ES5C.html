<meta name="summary" content="Stephen Chow's International Crowd-Pleaser!"></head><body><p>Having seen Stephen Chow gone from goofy TV star in the late '80s, to becoming the king of comedy of Hong Kong with a long list of box office hits since the early '90s, it's great to see him combining jokes, outlandish special effects, and Kung Fu in this film that is by far his most entertaining work, even better than Shaolin Soccer. This is no doubt Granddaddy Sing's(his nickname) most ambitious movie, since it had already conquered the box office in all Chinese cinemas as well in most Asian countries. Finally, his movie is getting to be launched in North America in wide release. Let's see if it'll kick ass like Hero and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.<br /><br />Since I have already acquired Sing(Stephen Chow's) style of comedy and action for film, I know it's not going to be a Jackie Chan or Jet Li kind of action/comedy. He's very much on a league of his own, so he's got something different to offer the foreign audiences. Fans of Jim Carrey will very likely dig Sing's movie, because the two actors have been compared a lot.<br /><br />The movie is about the war between The Axe Gang and The Pig Sty Alley, and Sing is pretending to be an amateur while seeking<br /> to become a member of the Axe Gang. There are some very powerful retired masters of Kung Fu Warriors living as normal residents in The Pig Sty Alley. The Tailor, The Coolie(handyman), and The Baker all have great power and skills, but have not use them until the intrusion of The Axe Gang. They defeated the gang effortlessly. The Axe Gang then hired The # 1 Killers(two men who use musical instrument to produce deadly melodies as their weapon) to fight against the Alley. Just when they had defeated the three defendents of the Valley, The Landlord and his wife The LandLady came out to show them some serious kung fu. The Landlord's special power is his body movement that can be bent like elastic, so his opponent cannot hit him easily. As for The Landlady, she can ran like a motorcycle, and her ultimate power is her voice(a skill known as The Lion's Roar). Sing was hired by the Gang to go help The Beast escape the mental Assylum, so that he can fight against The Alley. The Beast was known to be the best of the best in the world of kung fu, and he was in the Assylum because he had defeated everyone already. The Landlady and The Landlord were caught off guard when The Beast appeared. They thought they were the best in kung fu, and now they have to face the enemy of a life time. Who will save them if they failed?<br /><br />Wah Yuen(Landlord) and Qiu Yuen(Landlady) are very good together, and they delivered the laughs and great battle scenes. Qiu Yuen is actually very striking, espeically when she had the funniest lines and a outrageous personality. Other supporting players including the goofy Gang Leader(Danny Chan), and Tailor provided with some funny moments. The scene when Tailor was prancing around wearing a pair of red underwear seen through in a pair transparent pants, and got mocked by Landlady was a comic relief. The Lollipop Girl was unerexposed here, and I was expecting to see her practicing some special candy power, but she's just Sing's love interest. The action direction from renowned martial arts veteran Yuen Woo Ping certainly made the fight scenes over-the-top here. Along with a ton of special effects, it's very captivating, even if it looked kind of cartoonish at times.<br /><br />Stephen Chow didn't totally dominate the movie like his other films, and he allowed the supporting cast enough screentime, so that the group scenes are worthwhile. In fact, I didn't find him to be as funny as his previous films. He's more serious, and his fight scenes have improved a great deal, considered that he's not an action star.</p></body></html>

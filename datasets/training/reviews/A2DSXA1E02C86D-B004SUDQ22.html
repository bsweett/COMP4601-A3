Theoretical mathematicians can attain fame but not riches, and, unless they jam in a rock band in their spare time, are unlikely to find sexual partners.<br /><br />As the film opens, renowned math professor Robert (Anthony Hopkins) has just recently died of a ruptured aneurysm, leaving his daughter Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) alone in their rambling Chicago house. The funeral is to be the next day, for which Catherine's estranged sister Claire (Hope Davis) is flying in from New York City. Also intermittently present is Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), one of Robert's former students and now a mathematician in his own right, who, when not casting smoldering looks of longing at Catherine, is going through 113 of his mentor's handwritten notebooks looking for mathematical insights of genius worth publishing. The thing is, Robert had been "insane" for a good part of the last several years, and those notebooks contain nothing but gibberish.<br /><br />This film is as good as it is because of the exceptional performance of Paltrow, perhaps the best of her career, and which should be worth an Oscar nomination. Forget the romantic comedy fluff she's appeared in previously. Gyllenhaal, Davis, and Hopkins are also strong in supporting roles, but the viewer may not notice.<br /><br />The obvious conflict is between Catherine, emotionally battered from years as her father's sole care giver while trying to complete her own math studies at Northwestern, and the perky and obnoxious Claire, who's been off in the Big Apple leading a real life. Then, things heat up when Catherine shares with Hal a notebook squirreled away in Dad's old desk - a notebook that apparently contains a long-sought mathematical proof that would, if validated, turn the discipline on its collective ear. Hal first believes the proof was authored by Robert because it appears to be in his handwriting. Then Catherine claims that the astounding find was her doing. Unless true authorship can be determined, getting it published will be problematic.<br /><br />Compared to the undoubted power of Paltrow's dramatic performance, I thought the plot relatively weak. (Perhaps it's because differential calculus caused me to flame out and crash as a college frosh decades ago.) Robert's mental malady is unconvincing because the audience never really discovers what ails him, and he actually seems pretty normal in most of the flashbacks in which he appears. But weakest was the issue of the proof's questionable authorship. Well before the film's conclusion, the audience knows who really wrote it; Hal strongly suspects, but still can't see a way to prove it. OK then, why not just have the pages of the notebook dusted for fingerprints? The true author would have left them in droves to the exclusion of the other candidate. Hal needs to get out more.<br /><br />As fine a film as this is, tossing out the distractions of Hal and The Proof could have made it a leaner and meaner story of sibling conflict, albeit less of an offbeat love story.</p></body></html>

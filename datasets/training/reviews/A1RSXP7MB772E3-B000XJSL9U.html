The Die Hard saga really hasn't had a bad movie yet, unless you don't like the second very much. In any case, it even seems that the future may be brighter than ever. Especially with big production companies more willing than ever to finance remakes, and continuing franchise movies, like Die Hard. They hit gold by casting the face of Apple, Justin Long, who has the keys to our generations humor. He is the embodiment of sarcasm that typifies the younger generation. And seeing him with old timer Bruce Willis, really makes some relieving humor to go along with the trademark, impossible action sequences.<br /><br />When watching a Die Hard movie, you overlook, otherwise serious movie action goofs, such as taking out a helicopter with a car, because that's the ticket you bought. It worked in every Die Hard, and you would be someone who just doesn't get it if you started picking out all the head scratchers in this movie.<br /><br />I like two summer movies (so far) and the other is the Simpsons. And if you look at the date I review each, they're both on the same date. What an awesome day it was too! I really like the non computer graphics. It makes me feel like they put alot of hard physical work into, no offence to those hard working computer programers though. The four people I saw this with all commented on how good this cast was together. Me personally, I agree, but Bruce Willis is so awesome that I wouldn't care if they casted Ben Afflick in this! i'd still really be cheering the whole way. Is there anyone else in Hollywood today who can deliver corny one,two liners and get away with it like Bruce Willis? He's my favorite action actor and Mcclane is my favorite action hero.</p></body></html>

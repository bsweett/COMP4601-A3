This makes for drunken kung fu master types<br />of humor with deadly consequences for the unsuspecting<br />hatchet killers? We find an army in black with suits, hatchets, guns  and top hats<br />against a dock worker type, a cook and tinker?<br />Typical of a gang, the leader takes it out on his own men for failing?<br />If you like martial arts and the language of subtitles doesn't bother you this is a pure fun movie.</p></body></html>

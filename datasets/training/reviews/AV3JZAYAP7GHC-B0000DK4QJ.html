<meta name="summary" content="Taught thriller with outstanding visuals"></head><body><p>I didn't see this film in theater because of the Tom Cruise over-hype at the time, and I didn't believe that Spielberg could make a truly noir film. (I believe both A.I. and Shindler's List had too much of the Spielberg sugar coating for my taste, and was sure it would present here. I was wrong.)<p>While the ending has a too neat wrap-up common to Spielberg's films, I loved the mystery and the paranoia that he interwove into the story. Like any good thriller, we only know as much as the flawed main character does, and we are drawn into his tortuous journey to discover the truth.<p>Is our hero, Det. Anderton (Cruise), going to commit murder as PreCogs envisioned? Do any of us really have choice if our actions can be foretold? Are there sinister forces behind the controversial PreCog program?<p>And there are scenes that play out like a nightmare -- eerie, surreal, threatening. Just as Anderton thinks he's closer to solving the mystery, Spielberg throws him (and us) into yet another one that must be unraveled.<p>Along the way we are introduced to an entirely believable future vision of a society that has paid a large price for security. A world in which very little is held privately, and even those experiences or memories may not even be true.<p>This film kept me thinking long after it was over. Like I said, the ending was a little too Hollywood, but thankfully Spielberg laid off the sugary stuff to present, on the whole, an intriging and controversial look into our possible future.</p></body></html>

It would take all of Superman's effort not to glibly chuckle upon hearing one of them have the ability to elongate his arms to fit into tiny crevices. They seem to be stuck in the era of their creation, 1961, when optimum space and combustible fireballs may have been leading issues in science. It is not so fantastic, indeed a little silly, to watch Mr. Fantastic's deformed rubberized ability, a handy trick should you drop your keys down a sewer drain, but hardly the stuff of jumping tall buildings in a single bound. The comic book superhero movie genre has grown a bit tired, and THE FANTASTIC FOUR does little to elevate it's status, with a cramped visual style, a fault in many comic adaptations, using the tall building metropolis backdrop so often, it looks like it never leaves the same city street. Yet, as a kiddie toy movie, the tongue in cheek here, so firmly planted in a fun time, delivers a quick and enjoyable romp of supporting players in the comic book hall of fame. Ioan Goufudd, as Reed, or Mr. Fantastic is remarkably in tune to the bland dynamics of the leading hero, and Michael Chiklis, as The Thing, a sort of cross between The Incredible Hulk, The Michlin Man, and The Adams Family's Uncle Fester, offers a thoughtful, riotously funny interpretation of the reluctant monster.</p></body></html>

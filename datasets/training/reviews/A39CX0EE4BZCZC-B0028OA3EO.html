<meta name="summary" content="Suggestions For Future Superman Movies"></head><body><p>In one sentence "good, but could have been better."<br /><br />Overall, this updated Superman - the first since the Christopher Reeve versions a generation ago, is decent but too bland.<br /><br />What this new series needs is some "cool" villains, people fun to watch such as the three escapees from Krypton in Superman II. This series needs a spark that Spacey's "Luthor" didn't deliver. Add more humor, too. The other films had some laugh- out-loud scenes. Give Olsen and Perry some personality. Jack Larson's "Olsen" back on the TV series provided a lot of humor to the show. Get Perry White stirred up. Loosen up Brandon Routh (Superman) and make his character a little more fun, too. This movie would have been so much better with a lot more humor.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth not only is, by far, the prettiest Lois Lane ever, but portrays Lois in a likable fashion. That was nice to see. As for  Routh being the new Superman, I have no complaints. He reminded me a lot of a young Christopher Reeve. I liked the fact that although they played up Superman's feelings toward Lois, they didn't overdo it. They didn't have stupid lines like in 1978 with Superman proving his x-ray vision by telling Lois what color her panties were. In other words, this relationship was not corny or stupid as I felt the Reeve-Margot Kidder one was. Let's hope it stays that way.</p></body></html>

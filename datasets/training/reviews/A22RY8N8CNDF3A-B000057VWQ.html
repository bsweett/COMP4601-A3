<meta name="summary" content="Golden Rule & Great Christmas Tale"></head><body><p>"It's A Wonderful Life"  was released in 1946 and has played on TV almost as long.  It is an annual Christmas watch for me, along with "Scrooge" to absorb the Season's Spirit.  Overall it has a kind and generous message, although you sometimes feel it is corny, it works.  The main character, George Bailey, is played by Jimmy Stewart .  George has a problem at the bank he manages.  The examiners are there and $8,000 is missing.  A greedy, mean-spirited bank president finds the $8,000 in cash and keeps it to make George's life miserable.  George has  serious problems and contemplates suicide and drives his old car to a  lonely snowy spot on the town's bridge.  His guardian angel  "Clarence" played by Henry Travers appears and jumps in before George!  George jumps to rescue him and they end up drying clothes in a small shack together.  George wishes he had never been born and his wish comes true.  Clarence gives him the wish, and tours George through the town as it would have been without him.  It shows how George sacrificed his education for his brother's (who becomes a war hero), he kept the savings and loan going for his family, and  protected the small town from the avarice and greed of Mr. Potter.  George also married his beautiful childhood sweetheart (Donna Reed).  If none of this had happened, the town would have hit bottom and lives would have been wasted.  George saw what might have been and learned his life was important.  In the end, the town came together with plenty of money to save the Savings and Loan and his reputation.  The only "open-ended" item was why Mr. Potter never gave the stolen  $8,000 back to the bank he ran.</p></body></html>

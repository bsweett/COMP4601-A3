<meta name="summary" content="A truly horrific prequel to the other Hannibal Lecter films"></head><body><p>"Red Dragon," directed by Brett Ratner, could be considered a "prequel" to "The Silence of the Lambs," in which Anthony Hopkins so memorably portrayed cannibalistic serial murderer Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Hopkins reprises the role in "Dragon." Here he is joined by Edward Norton as Will Graham, the FBI agent who puts Lecter behind bars. In this film, Graham seeks the imprisoned Lecter's advice in capturing another serial murderer, Francis Dolarhyde (played by Ralph Fiennes).<p>Suspenseful and well-acted, "Dragon" is a superb companion piece to "Silence" and its follow-up, the way-over-the-top "Hannibal." "Dragon" contains some really startling, horrific scenes that match the other films in intensity. The film is marked by superb production details, including some really dramatic makeup effects. The story is well-paced.<p>Because of the characters' shared history, the dynamic between Lecter and Graham is much different than that between Lecter and Agent Starling, the doctor's sparring partner in the previous two films. This new dynamic gives a different twist to the film.<p>Norton and Hopkins are superb in their roles. They are joined by a truly amazing cast. As the murderous Dolarhyde, Fiennes shows us just enough of the man inside this bizarre, ritualistic monster. Harvey Keitel brings effective gravity to his role as Graham's supervisor. And Emily Watson is stunning as Dolarhyde's blind co-worker, Reba; this is a compelling character, and the humanity of Watson's performance really helps ground the film. To sum up, "Red Dragon" is a potent blend of horror, suspense, and gripping human drama.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Amazing Powerful film.  Whitaker is astonishing."></head><body><p>A slightly fictionalized story set against the backdrop of one of the more horrific dictatorships in history, "The Last King of Scotland" proves to be a cinematic gem with one of the most outstanding performances in film history.<br />  Forest Whitaker portrays the notorious Ugandan dictator during his rule in the 1970's.  To provide a reference angle for that time, the composite character of Nicholas Garrigan (played by Jim McEvoy) is created.  Loosely based on several individuals from that time, he is reckless, bored young doctor who travels to Uganda in search of adventure and ends up becoming Idi Amin's personal physician where he is charmed, intoxicated, and eventually terrified by Amin's power.  He bears witness Amin's purges of his enemies (real and imagined), his paranoid expulsion of Asian business from the country, and his involvement the Palestinian terrorists who hijacked an Air France passenger jet.  While there is certain dramatic license taken with actual events, this film does a masterful job at portraying this monstrous individual.<br />  Whitaker gave his all to perform the role of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.  He learned Swahili and was able to adopt his West African accent.  In addition, he learned all the mannerisms and personality traits of Amin.  His transformation was so completely that, for months after filming was completed on this film, Whitaker would still slip into his Idi Amin persona.  The result was almost indescribable in its excellence.  Whitaker may have been the most deserving winner of the Best Actor Oscar in history.<br />  "The Last King of Scotland" derives its title from Amin's obsession with Scotland.  He even offered to be Scotland's King (hence the title), but the offer was understandably rejected.  This movie is not a film for the faint of heart.  It is unflinching in its portrayals of Amin's atrocities.  But, for those who do see it, the power of this portrayal will stay with you long after you leave the theater.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="CIA Action Flick"></head><body><p>This was a great movie!  Almost non-stop action--car chases, run from the CIA, lots of shooting and fighting, and a few twists and turns.<br /><br />Evelyn Salt is a CIA intelligence officer.  She is married to a German National who has easy access to move freely, in and out of Korea.  She is about to go home to celebrate her wedding anniversary when a Russian defector shows up at the office, telling a story.  He says he is dying of cancer and has nothing to lose.  He explains that many years ago, the Russians developed a plot to ruin America, the "KA" program ("kill America", I guess).  They trained many, many children and then substituted them into American life as "sleepers", to participate in a well-orchestrated plot at a much later time.  When the time is right, these children would be activated.  The one assigned to kill the Russian president was Evelyn Salt!<br /><br />As Evelyn is interrogating the defector, the other agents are running a body scan on him which indicates he is telling the truth.  Uh oh.  They begin to look at Evelyn a little differently.  Meanwhile, she is concerned about her husband's safety and takes off to find him.  This begins Evelyn's chase and a ton of action.<br /><br />Is "our" Evelyn Salt really Agent Chenkov?  Or is someone setting her up?  Watch and see.  I think you will really enjoy this movie if you like action.<br /><br />BTW--Yes, there is a lot of BS in the chase scenes, where Evelyn would likely have been killed in real life many times over, BUT, that's what makes a movie fun!  They get up and keep on going--they are the ONE person in the whole world who could survive or could achieve something.  Get real--that's what you go to see--the so-called impossible stuff! Angelina does a great job in this high-action flick!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good movie."></head><body><p>I've been wanting to see this movie for ages.<br />With Hartnet, Willis, Freeman, and Kingsley this movie is not short on star power.<br />This is one of those movies that pretty much keeps you in the dark till the very end.<br />If you don't like movies where you're sitting there for almost two hours wondering what is going on then you probably won't like this movie.<br />I honestly enjoyed it.<br />It had an interesting story that held my attention till the very end.<br />At almost two hours it was a tad long.<br />Still, a good movie with an excellent cast.<br />Worth a rental.<br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

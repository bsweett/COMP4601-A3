The atmosphere, tension and suspence was all realized. However, the actual plot is a bit thin. It wasn't as great as I thought it would be and personally I think its overrated. Is it a good movie, yes, I enjoyed it, but nothing more. I love the dark quality of the film though, it dares to go down the most evil and dreaded path and it succeeds in that at least. But when it was over and done, I just sort of shrugged and thought, OK. That was nice. Is it worth a viewing. Yes, certainly. Visually its stunning and engrossing to a point. But I'm not sure I could muster up a 2nd viewing.</p></body></html>

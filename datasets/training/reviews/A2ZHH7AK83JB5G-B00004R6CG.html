<meta name="summary" content="Overlook the Plot Holes and be Wholly Entertained"></head><body><p>For classic suspense entertainment a viewer can't go wrong with Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO. The plot is  intriguing as we are first presented with an apparent tale of reincarnation or soul possession.  There are at least two major twists that are likely to really shock those fortunate enough to watch the movie with no prior knowledge of the story.  Of course with too much thought the improbability of these twists become apparent so the wise viewer will simply suspend disbelief and enjoy.<br /><br />The acting in VERTIGO is top notch.  Nice guy James Stewart plays early retired detective Scottie with just enough hint of character imperfection to make him believable.  Kim Novak is not just gorgeous but fully creates both the lovely, troubled aristocrat Madeleine and the practical beauty, sales clerk Judy.  And I especially like Barbara Bel Geddes (known to baby boomers as Dallas's Miss Ellie) playing Scottie's artist/friend Midge who somehow seems a little mysterious herself.  Baby boomers who watched a lot of TV in their youth will l also recognize Ellen Corby (Grandma Walton) as a hotel clerk who puzzles Scottie and Raymond Bailey from The Beverly Hillbillies playing a psychiatrist.  The city of San Francisco and some of the surrounding area are so beautifully photographed VERTIGO could be a travelogue.  Fans of Alfred Hitchcock will not want to miss this masterpiece.</p></body></html>

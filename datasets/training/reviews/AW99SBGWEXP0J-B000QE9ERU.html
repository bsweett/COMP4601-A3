<meta name="summary" content="The Punisher"></head><body><p>Federal agent Frank Castle's (Jane) last mission before retirement goes wrong, and the son of local mob boss Howard Saint (Travolta) is killed.  Saint is not above revenge, and on the advice of his wife, targets Castle's entire family.  The massacre at a family reunion leaves everyone dead, or at least presumed dead.  The sole survivor, of course, is Castle, who embarks on a quest to deliver punishment to Saint and his lackeys.  Yet another movie that is based on a comic book, The Punisher manages to be depressing and horrifying in parts, and humorous in others.  The lighter moments make the heavier ones easier to take and provide some relief.  Thomas Jane, a relatively new face in movies, does an excellent job as a man bent on revenge...make that punishment.</p></body></html>

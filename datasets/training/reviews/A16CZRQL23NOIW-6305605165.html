<meta name="summary" content="A classic and timeless film!"></head><body><p>A man faces the ruin , he has had a hard time of it all his life , and is sent hel from above in the guise of a guardian angel .<br /><br />This was the new vision , the slap in the face for all those dark voices who emerged from the recent echoes of the WW2 . Frank Capra in his masterpiece , decides to walk a step ahead and make his own statement about the life . Donna Reed one of my favorite brides in the cinema makes a glorious tour de force in this charming and haunting comedy drama . The union spirit will be present just in the Christmas day .<br /><br />This movie was a real oasis to the hopeless and the awful memories of a generation signed by the war , physical and mental scares . And Capra like the admirable magicians, had always the rabbit under the hat and with this he won his place in the throne of the giants film makers in the century .<br /><br />Unforgettable scenes and several moral lessons will be present in this work as secondary narrative lines.</p></body></html>

Based on the novel by Richard Condon (author of PRIZZI'S HONOR), the film is usually categorized as a political thriller, though it is often more intense and frightening than many contemporary slasher or horror films due to a depiction of drug-induced brainwashing and subliminal mind control that is not all that improbable (especially now, in light of the vast and astonishing strides that have since been made in medicine and other technologies).  Indeed, after the shooting of President Kennedy in late 1963, many suspected that that THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE may have actually served as a blueprint for the &quot;conspiracy&quot; behind the assassination, and the film's plot seemingly hit so close to home that longtime Kennedy supporter and associate Frank Sinatra, one of the film's stars, used his influence to keep the movie out of reach of the moviegoing public for several years thereafter.<p>The acting in this movie is simply superb.  Frank Sinatra's portrayal of a troubled Korean War veteran is arguably the best of his career, and as the titular character, Laurence Harvey creates a sympathetic yet unnerving portrait of a man whose mind and fate are no longer under his own control.  Angela Lansbury--seen in recent years on TV's popular MURDER, SHE WROTE--gives an outstanding and convincing performance as the conniving and egoistic mother of brainwashed &quot;war-hero&quot; Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey).  There are also good performances from a strong supporting cast, including the beautiful Janet Leigh (of PSYCHO fame) and character actor James Gregory (probably better known as Inspector Luger on TV's BARNEY MILLER).<p>The DVD release from MGM offers a few nice extras, including an interesting and sometimes insightful feature commentary from director John Frankenheimer.  The digital transfer is good, though it could have used some clean-up of scratches and artifacts.  In short, the overall DVD quality and the very reasonable price make purchase of this classic psychological thriller a no-brainer (no pun intended).</p></body></html>

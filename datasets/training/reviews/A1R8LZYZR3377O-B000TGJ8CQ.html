<meta name="summary" content="SERIOUS SCI-FI!!"></head><body><p>Very interesting film. It was missing a few components though. Some scenes were a stretch, but the viseral and thought impact made up for most of its shortcomings. Nicolas Cage is not one of my favorites but he was spot on as the "magician" who can actually see 2 minutes into the future. Great storyline. Seeing the future can be more complex then most people would think and the movie is careful to point that out. That adds realism. I was disappointed with Jessica Biel. Sure shes got a hot body but something was missing from her acting. I think its more that she was the wrong person for the role, too prissy. Pleny of twists and turns. Much time and thought was put into the making of this and it shows. This is the kind of sci-fi that develops appreciation from true lovers of the genre. Its good to see Peter Falk in a film again, especially this kind of film. Pure entertainment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Civilized Savagery...."></head><body><p>A village of hunter/gatherers in the primordial rain forest are savagely overwhelmed and either killed or captured by forces of the great "civilization" of the time, who lead the survivors back to their city to perform blood sacrifices to appease the mob and perpetuate a corrupted society on the verge of collapse.  One man escapes and races back through the jungle, with pursuers hot on his heels, in order to save the wife and child he had hidden before the attack.<br /><br />There are many ways this film could have been executed, most of them badly.  When I first heard Mel Gibson was making this film and had opted to have the dialogue in (I assume) the actual language of the people's with subtitles, it sounded nuts.  But Mel dared to do it and trusted his film-making craft to do the rest.  And he has succeeded in spades.<br /><br />A wild and intense chase film, done with astonishing skill and cleverness, amid the background of a thorougly imagined time and culture, it grabbed and held my interest throughout.  This is why I still go to the movies.  To be taken someplace in time and geography I could never see for myself.  It's also why I read books.<br /><br />First let me say I did not find the violence excessive.  I thought it was appropriate to the story and not overly dwelt upon.  Mel cuts away when he needs to, and he may have had an extra spray of blood or so, but I actually found more over-the-top violence in The Patriot, a movie Mel was in, but didn't direct.  I did think The Passion was too much, but I'm not reviewing that film. As another reviewer said the various CSI's on TV are sometimes gorier.<br /><br />What I found was a completely engaging film of imagined history, remarkable in its production values, and directed with energy and passion.  That you can draw inferences from the depiction of simple and gentle and all too human life in the village versus the excesses and corruption and degeneracy, albeit just as human, in the Mayan city, is only icing. Mel doesn't explain the reasons for their decline, he just presents it; there to think about at no extra cost.  And, a final irony regarding the clash of cultures rounds out the film's question as to what is truly civilized and what is savage.<br /><br />Many reviews I've read seem to be reviewing, or should I say reviling, Mel Gibson.  Gee, might his Malibu episode have something to do with that?  If we start judging artists works by their despicable personal behavior, we can begin emptying out the museums, libraries, art galleries, and film archives.  This film stands on its own terms, and it is a fine & daring piece of work.  Entertaining and with an added something else.</p></body></html>

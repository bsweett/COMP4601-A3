<meta name="summary" content="The man behind the curtain"></head><body><p>: The rise and fall (and rise again) of Yuri Orlov arms dealer is the focus of Andrew Niccol's acidic (writer of "The Truman Show" and writer-director of "SimOne", "Gattaca") unfocused blend of satire and action in "Lord of War".  Yuri has no hidden agenda beyond making money unlike his rival Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm) who lives to influence the way the wind of power blows. Oh and Yuri's also got an Interpol agent (Ethan Hawke) on his trail as well. Things aren't going so well right now for Yuri even though he's raking in record profits. Recalling Stanley Kubrick's black humor classic Nicholas Cage portrays Yuri as the ultimate salesman-he could be selling pharmaceuticals or a car but he's decided to be "the merchant of death".  "Lord of War" is a deft mix of action, drama and satire. With actors Jared Leto as Yuri's confused drug dependent younger brother and Bridget Moynahan as his seemingly oblivious wife the film lights up the screen combining brilliant visual motifs with top notch acting, writing and direction. The opening sequence where we follow a bullet from "birth" to "death" is a riveting powerful sequence.<br /><br />A very nice sharp transfer for "Lord of War" the film looks quite good with rich colors and an active 6.1 mix DTS audio mix, a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Ex mix and an audio commentary by writer/director Andrew Niccol on a 2.0 mix. The audio comes across crystal clear.<br /><br /> First two criticisms about the product itself not the quality of the film or special features. 1) I hate the packaging of this two disc edition. It looks cheap and sucks big time.  Once you slide out the two disc set from the cardboard sleeve you'll find the two discs housed in a cheap cardboard case with a disc holder glued in the middle. It looks very tacky. The single disc edition at least appears to come in an Amray hardcase. 2) The single disc edition has no extras, zero. This recalls the time when movies were released on DVD a decade ago with just the feature film. This nasty trend didn't start with but was most noticeable with Steven Spielberg's "War of the Worlds". All major studios stop doing this it confuses consumers (some people who want the editions with extras can't find them or, worse yet, buy the single disc sets and then get upset. It's ticking off the customer. Lion's Gate this is an idiotic move. Don't do it again. If you're going to put out a two disc edition do it right-put in a two disc Amray case WITH a booklet vs. these cheapo looking cardboard containers. Steven Spielberg should have been ashamed and Lion's Gate you should be too.<br /><br />The first disc has two special features. The first is an intelligent and informative commentary track by writer/director Andrew Niccol. Niccol's an intelligent and passionate writer/director. Most of the monologue focuses on production details but there is a good amount of other things discussed as well that Niccol learned during the research for his film. Although Niccol's commentary is intermittent and quiet it's intelligent and focused. The second extra on the first disc is an Easter egg if you click on the Amnesty International logo. Nicholas Cage appears in a plea to prevent the continue sales of arms. He discusses the impact that it has in terms of human life.<br /><br />The second disc of this DVD features most of the special features. The most important one is the documentary ""Making a Killing"" which takes a look at the true cost of selling arms. These people that do it look at themselves as businessmen but they are, in reality, nothing more than leeches living off of the suffering of humanity. Featuring interviews with William Schultz of Amnesty International and Philip Coyle a Senior Advisor with the World Security Institute. As Coyle points out the U.S. is one of the largest arms sellers and we end up going to war against many of the countries that end up eventually buying many of these killing machines. Dr Sylvester Rowe Executive Director of the United States also appears as narrating documentary footage shot in many of these Third World countries where tin dictators pay for arms to stay in control while their populations starve. It's an informative excellent featurette. We also find out the fate of children in these countries who end up becoming young soldiers and victims of their society. "Weapons of the Trade" features a gallery of the various weapons seen in the film, a text history of the weapon and the specs. "The Making of `Lord of  War'" is a marvelous behind-the-scenes featurette. We hear comments from director Niccol about what inspired him to make this acidic satire and what attracted the various actors to the project. There's also a photo gallery, trailers for the film and seven deleted scenes that round out the special features on the second disc.<br /><br />Although it's an imperfect film, "Lord of War" is still a deft entertaining and acidic satire on the obsession our world has with weapons of destruction. Cage gives a brilliant performance as Yuri the arms dealer and has able support from Jared Leto, Ian Holm, Ethan Hawke, Bridget Moynahan  and Eamonn Walker as a psychotic despot leader. It's well worth watching although, depending on your political beliefs, you'll be either outraged at Niccol's liberal point of view or delighted to find someone who agrees with you.</p></body></html>

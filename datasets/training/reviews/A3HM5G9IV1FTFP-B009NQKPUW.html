But while James Cameron's "Avatar" was a crowd-pleasing affair, creating a vibrant, almost psychedelic world, "Prometheus" is a somber, cerebral and ambiguous piece of filmmaking.<br /><br />Two archaeologists, Elizabeth (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green) discover cave paintings around the world, all from different civilizations and eras, which point to a moon far away in space which has the ability to support life. The two are convinced that the creators of human life (or "Engineers" as they refer to them) are from there, and that the paintings are an actual invitation to visit. They find a corporate sponsor (Wayland Corp.) willing to bankroll a trillion-dollar space mission to the faraway moon to investigate (although it's clear from the beginning that they have their own motives beyond just the archeologists' fantasy of meeting humanity's creators). So off Elizabeth and Charlie go, along with an entire crew which includes android David (a spellbinding Michael Fassbender) and Wayland Corp. administrator (an icy Charlize Theron).<br /><br />And so it begins. Anyone who's seen any of the "Alien" films will have no doubt that the crew is not, sadly, going to be meeting up with a benevolent, advanced civilization that created humanity and welcomes them with open arms. The film is called "Prometheus," which refers to a Greek myth about a god who is punished for helping humanity by being forced to have his liver eaten, and then regenerate in order to relive the ordeal day after day. In my opinion, the myth of "Oedipus" would be just as fitting a reference for this film; Oedipus' fatal flaw, his relentless need to learn the truth, is what caused his downfall and suffering. Similarly, the main characters in the film mostly share a need to find the origin and meaning behind human life, and suffer greatly for it.<br /><br />"Don't we all want to see our parents die?" asks David at one point, which is a strange question coming from an android who doesn't actually have parents per se. But the film explores, on many levels, the oftentimes antagonistic relationship between parent/child and creator/creation.</p></body></html>

I wouldn't have thought to nominate her for an Oscar, but she did well, and I'm glad she got it.  It wasn't because she is a brilliant actress, it was because for a girl who got kicked off American Idol, she had a brilliant voice that was finally revealed.  It is definitely Tony quality, but since it was in a movie, it's Oscar worthy.  Secondly, for a newcomer to acting, her enthusiasm was decent.  Dreamgirls is entertaining, dazzling, well-editted and well-put together.  But no wonder it didn't receive Best Picture.  It doesn't have the depth of Ray or the Grab-them-by-the-heart-strings sense that a Best Picture film should have.<br /><br />Despite not being nominated,  I though Beyonce, Jamie Foxx and Danny Glover did a great job as well.  This movie should have won at least for editting and costumes.</p></body></html>

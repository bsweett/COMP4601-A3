That being said, after seeing the trailer for this film at the theater, I knew I had to see it.<br /><br />The story focuses on Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), a young man who has a happy life----a member of a close knit village of family and friends.  Soon, however, his world is destroyed by Mayan invaders who attack the village, capturing the adults (the ones who are not slaughtered) and leaving behind the children to die.  Before he is caught, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and son in a deep cravass but is soon herded off to a great Mayan city for a dreadful fate, uncertain of what will become of his young family.<br /><br />Once inside the huge city, the captives see slaves laboring to build the ever expanding city and crowds cheering, hungry for blood.  The women are sold off and the men, it is soon learned, are destined to be sacrificed to a Mayan god.<br /><br />Fate leads Jaguar Paw away from death and gives him a chance to return to his home and possibly save his family who remain stranded underground.  What follows is a frantic chase, with captors at his heels, as a young man uses his wits (and blessed by good luck at times) to escape the evil that is closing in on him.<br /><br />Gibson managed to make a fast past movie that gives us a glimpse into the mysteries of the Mayan civiliztion.  He also gives us a parting glance at a culture that is dying and at the start of its decline.  The scenes of the peaceful village being attacked and sheperded into slavery are hard to watch and you will find yourself desperately hoping that these poor people will somehow manage to escape their horrific destinies.  While the ending of the movie leaves room for optimism, it also shows us that one evil can easily be replaced by another, more powerful evil.<br /><br />The film is spoken entirely in the Mayan language (with English subtitles) but don't be put off by this.  The story moves along quickly and the action is well paced.  The lead, Rudy Youngblood, does an excellent job as the man who's life is forever changed but is determined to save his wife and child.<br /><br />A worthy addition to any dvd collection!  Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

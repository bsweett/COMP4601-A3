<meta name="summary" content="A Candy Gram From Spielberg"></head><body><p>It's interesting to watch how the career of Steven Spielberg, arguably the greatest director working today, has evolved.  In his second feature film, Spielberg seems to have taken his cues from the master, Alfred Hitchcock, most notably "The Birds".  On what was probably a limited budget and limited technology of the time, Spielberg elicits enough scares to put today's CGI driven film-makers to shame.  Spielberg utilizes cinematography, film-editing, and most effectively a great John Williams score to maximum effect.  Spielberg was also blessed with the perfect cast in Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfus.  Murray Hamilton even gives a good performance as the mayor who would sacrifice vacationers for the all-mighty dollar.  One of the more effective scenes in the film is the one where Robert Shaw as Quint, the shark-hunter, relates the story of the crew of the U.S.S. Indianapolis.  I never read the book on which this was based but it was my understanding that it was kind of trashy.  If that's the case then Spielberg has elevated trash into gold.</p></body></html>

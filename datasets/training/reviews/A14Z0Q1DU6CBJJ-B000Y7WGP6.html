<meta name="summary" content="IF IT WERE ONLY THAT EASY"></head><body><p>On the cover of THE KINGDOM DVD, it reads: "A riveting, hold-your-breath ticking time-bomb of a movie." some dude from maxim magazine.<br /><br />I believe that he was the guy that they put up in the luxury hotel and gave him a few square meals when he came to see the film.<br /><br />THE KINGDOM is not a bad movie, but to say it's a riveting, hold-your-breath ticking time-bomb is a tremendous exageration. Yes, like a time bomb... nothing happens until the last thirty minutes when it finally erupts, but that is where all the plot holes and problems with the film subside. The ticking time bomb... proves to be a dud.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed THE KINGDOM, to an extent, but it just falls right into a long list of movies that I've seen in the past few years that I've already forgotten. Once I'm done writing this review, THE KINGDOM will most likely never be talked about by me or many others.<br /><br />The story revolves around a terrorist act against infadels in Saudi Arabia. A softball game on a military base. FBI agents are brought into the foreign country to help find the culprits. Yet, they are restrained and watched and trapped in a building at night, not allowed to gather evidence and not allowed to interview anyone without a Saudi witness hovering over their shoulder.<br /><br />All of this, I found tremendously realistic and unsettling. This was some of the stuff that THE KINGDOM did right. You can feel the resentment of the Saudi's for us being there. They are more concerned and untrusting of us being there, then the deed inflicted by one of their own.<br /><br />Yet, when the movie unfolds and they start actually making headway, zeroing in on the illusive terrorist that nobody can identify, everything goes predictably wrong. A reference to a man's severed and mangled hands being the hands of a bomb maker. A pointless attack on the FBI convoy as they are LEAVING THE COUNTRY which ends up being the ONLY REASON why they track the CULPRITS back to their hideout. A series of terrorist cliche's that seem to role out like a collection of headlines over the last 4 years. Hidden behind children and women. Videotaping an intended beheading. Terrorists firing RPGs willy nilly. An American giving a saudi child a sucker in the midst of a battle. All of which are true, but crammed into a twenty minute time period, seemed unrealistic, cliche' and predictable.<br /><br />It's an okay movie, just forgettable... what movie were we talking about again?</p></body></html>

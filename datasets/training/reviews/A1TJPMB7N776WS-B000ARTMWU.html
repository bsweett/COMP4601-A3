<meta name="summary" content="Dubbing is Bad"></head><body><p>"High Tension" (Haute Tension in French) is dubbed to within an inch of it's already tenuous life to attract those who the producers feel would not attend a foreign language horror/gore film(that is a film not in english)with sub-titles...which just irks the hell out of me. Is this 2005 or 1965?<br /><br />Trimmed by the MPAA from the original NP-17 yet containing scenes way-over-the-top grisly and gore-wise that I had to wonder what is the MPAA holding back the NC-17 for? Oh yes, for the dreaded S-E-X scenes. Oh yeah: it's ok to show a guy's head being sliced off than to show two consenting adults having sex.<br /><br />Phillipe Nohan (Gaspar Noe's "I Stand Alone") plays a loony who murders, nay... slaughters a wife, husband and a small child in the rural south of france and kidnaps their teenage daughter, Alex.<br /><br />Alex's friend, Marie (Cecile de France of "The Spanish Apartment")gamely tries to rescue her friend Alex against all reason and logic.<br /><br />"High Tension," probably even with the deleted scenes,would not be a good film. But the arrogance and short-sightedness of the producers and the ignorance and illogical cutting of the film by the MPAA turn this minor film into a cause celebre among those of us who support free artistic expression in a world in which so many of our freedoms have been randomly and summarily snatched from us.</p></body></html>

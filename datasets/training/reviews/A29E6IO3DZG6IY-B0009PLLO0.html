<meta name="summary" content="AWFUL!"></head><body><p>I watched some of this on TV and it was sooooo bad, I turned the channel.  I went back to it a while later, and it was still BAD. Bad casting, really bad acting, bad cheap-looking costumes, bad sets, bad editing, bad screenwriting, bad, bad, bad.... This film is junk.  It flopped in theaters too.  I'd have given it No Stars, but I had to chose something to go further....'nuf sed.</p></body></html>

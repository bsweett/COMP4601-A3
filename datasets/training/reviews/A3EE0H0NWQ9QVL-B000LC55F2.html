<meta name="summary" content="Dirty Tricks Make for Spine-tingling Sensation"></head><body><p>`The Prestige' is an intriguing magician story that provides a spine-tingling movie experience as the film moves along.  Ably acted by key players and directed with finesse by `Memento' and `Batman Begins' director, Christopher Nolan, the film builds up a nasty rivalry amongst magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman).  They start out as understudies for senior magician, Cutter (Michael Caine), and practice by being the staged volunteers for certain magic tricks.  Tragedy comes one day when Alfred works out an alternative knot to tie assistant, Julia Angier (Piper Perato), Robert's wife, for a Houdini-like trick, being tied inside a water tank for a staged escape.  It goes all wrong, and it is unclear if Alfred tied her in an inescapable knot.  He can't remember which knot he made, which provides a haunting cast of suspicion and doubt.  She dies, leaving Robert heartbroken, but her loss brings a constant trail of revenge and counter-revenge as both players play tricks on one another, breaking one another's secrets and limbs.  Robert and Alfred take their rivalry on stage where each tries to outdo one another.  Robert replaces his assistant and wife with a mistress, Olivia Wenscombe(Scarlett Johansson), who is not enough consolation, but her own bitterness provides a tie with his rival, Alfred, with results that seem sleight-of-hand.<br /><br />`The Prestige' becomes a taut and impressive display of tricks played on the stage and with the audience.  There is also a historical rivalry between the brilliant eccentric inventor, Tesla (David Bowie), and Thomas Edison that gives the whole affair more depth and meaning.  The suspense, as with any magic show, is impressive as is some of the delivery.  `The Prestige' is expert at making one guess what will happen next. With plenty of steps and a few missteps, `The Prestige' offers a dark, but delightful show, even if some of the magic is too unbelievable even when seen.</p></body></html>

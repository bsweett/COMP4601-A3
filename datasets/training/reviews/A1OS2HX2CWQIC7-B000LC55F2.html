At this juncture, it wouldn't be unfair for the Nolans to abandon non-linear plotting; they've exploited the conceit so thoroughly here in conjunction with numerous interrelated visual metaphors in order to fully explore a variety of Victorian themes: the thrill of technology-driven entrepreneurship during the onset of modernity, science as magic explained and the nature of dualistic identity, among others.<br /><br />This DVD's menu design - typeface, colors, animation, etc. - assumes a distinctly Victorian style. The main menu features a spinning picture that frames one of four sets of images based on the most prominent magic tricks in the film; the displayed picture can be selected from a set of icons beneath the menu options.<br /><br />I saw The Prestige once in theater, though I would have gladly attended another screening or two, had I an opportunity to do so. The theatrical soundtrack irked me for the same reasons why this disc's 5.1 Dolby Digital track does: certain sound effects and swells in passages of the score are deafeningly loud, while much of the narrative dialogue is nearly inaudible. Some difficulty is suffered to tweak EQ in order to facilitate this mix. French and Spanish dubbed dialogue tracks are quite good here, as are English, French and Spanish subtitles. As I expected, the picture is impeccable; anything less would be an offensive treatment of Wally Pfister's beautiful photography.<br /><br />The disc's picture gallery contains images of photos shot on set during and between takes, many of which focus on the production's lavish costumes and sets. Other selections include publicity shots and the painted advertisement posters seen in the movie.<br /><br />Nolan opted not to record a commentary track for The Prestige, concerned that such a feature might diminish the mystique of its proceedings. Instead, a nineteen-minute documentary featurette is included here, consisting of interviews with the principal cast and crew in addition to quite a lot of behind-the-scenes footage.</p></body></html>

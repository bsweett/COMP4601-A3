<meta name="summary" content="Cool and Watchable but Still Not Marvel's Best....At All...."></head><body><p>Nicolas Cage stars as Johny Blaze who as a teenager makes a deal with Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) to cure his father's cancer. He cures his cancer but never promises that he wouldn't die some other way...Johny then takes off and leaves his g/f behind. He continues as a professional stuntman in his father's footsteps. Eva Mendes "his former g/f" re-enters his life and she's now a reporter. He wants to get back into her life but he never makes it to their date because Mephistopheles also re-enters his life and he him to be his new bounty hunter. He turns him into a skull faced monster who can punish sinners. Cage has no control of his actions when he is the Ghostrider and automatically has to go head to head with Mephistopheles' son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) who wants to become stronger than Mephistopheles. So he wants Ghostrider to stop him and his other demon followers.<br /><br />  But Blaze learns to control his new powers and wants to use them for good. A mysterious grave digger (Sam Elliot) knows all about what is going on and wants to help Blaze learn how to handle his new powers. The effects are decent and the look of the film is good. Nicolas Cage who was supposed to play Superman like 10 yrs ago shows that he's surprisingly good in a comic book movie. He's actually the best thing about the movie. Peter Fonda is also good as Mephistopheles or I guess you can just call him the Devil. He's cool in the movie and it would've been nice to see more of him instead of the slightly annoying Bentley. Donal Logue (Blade, Grounded for Life) adds some humor as Blaze's trainer but he's not really used enough either. Sam Elliot also gives one of the better performances in the movie.<br /><br />  It's not really performances that hold this movie back from being great. Director Mark Steven Johnson handles the beginning of the movie just like he did with Daredevil. Although the father in Daredevil was developed better and we cared about his relationship with his son. We barely even see the dad enough here to learn to care about his fate. A lot of this movie just feels like one scene clunked onto another and another. It has it's fun parts but it would've been better if the movie wasn't done sorta sloppy. It can feel like Johnson is directing it with his eyes close. I think he did a much better job with the under-rated Daredevil. This movie has it's entertaining parts and Cage is super cool in the movie as are a lot of the supporting actors. But I had to remind myself that I even seen the movie. It's good looking and cool yet it is still pretty forgettable as well.</p></body></html>

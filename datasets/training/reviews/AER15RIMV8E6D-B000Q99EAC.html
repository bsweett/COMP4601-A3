<meta name="summary" content="Rocky is Back!!!"></head><body><p>I loved it. I waited six or seven years for this Rocky masterpiece to come out, and it was all worth it. I love when they play the original theme during his training and running up the stairs with Punchie. (His dog.) I loved all the Adrian and Mickey flashbacks. I also loved the fight toward the end with Rocky and Mason, showing that Rocky could still go toe-to-toe, so people who want him to win, you might be disappointed, but hard-core fans who love Rocky and see that he still has it, you'll love it. Also, I thought the fight was too short, but it was still great. I highly recommend ROCKY BALBOA!!!</p></body></html>

I just saw the film last night and felt pretty much the same way about it as a felt about Martin Scorsese's "The Departed"; all flash, no crash.<br /><br />First off, the actors in this film are absolutely brilliant. Bardem was chillingly creepy and the hitman without conscience or remorse and Tommy Lee Jones was excellent and likable as always.<br /><br />The film starts off with a bang and keeps you rivited....until the very end.<br /><br />Just like "The Departed", "No Country" just abruptly.....ends. After witnessing great cinematography, amazing acting, and an intriguing plot, the film just goes absolutely nowhere.<br /><br />>>>> POSSIBLE SPOLIERS - No loose ends are tied up, no justice is meted out, and no plot comes to a resolution. Things just happen.....and then they stop happening.<br /><br />This was the picture of the year? Wow. Who makes these descisions?<br /><br />At first, I really liked the film. When it was all over, I felt cheated out of an ending.<br /><br />Yeah. The world is a violent place. Our society is going to hell in a handbasket and all that, but for the makers of this film to feel that they are making some profound statement about the nature of humanity and passing it off as art is downright arrogant and pretentious.<br /><br />Sorry, folks. In my opinion (and it's ONLY that; an opinion), this film is a letdown and completely unworthy of even an Oscar NOMINATION, let alone the winner for best picture. I've seen MUCH better films in 2007.<br /><br />On a side note, I love that fact that this site exists so people can share their opinions and viewpoints about films such as this, but it would be a lot better if everyone would just stop criticizing and attacking each other just because their opinions are different. If everyone had the same tastes, media and the arts would be boring and pointless. Enjoy the diversity!</p></body></html>

This creature goes on a killing rampage inflicting terror on those who come in contact with him. "Jeepers Creepers" went on to be a huge boxoffice smash making nearly $60,000,000 and spawning a sequel called "Jeppers Creepers 2" that was just as good as the original. Producers have stated that a Part 3 and Part 4 will be made in the very near future with Victor Salva coming aboard again as the writer and director. This 2 disc DVD set features a slew of bonuses including deleted and extended scenes, an alternate opening, director's audio commentary, a featurette called "A Collection Of Mini-Featurettes on the Making of The Film", original trailer, and more. This is a great way to celebrate Halloween! Turn down the lights and get the popcorn...you will be scared out of your wits!</p></body></html>

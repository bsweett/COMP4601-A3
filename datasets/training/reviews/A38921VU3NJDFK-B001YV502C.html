<meta name="summary" content="Children of Men (2006)"></head><body><p>In director Alfonso Cuaron's finest work to date, he attacks itchy subjects such as terrorism, overpopulation, pollution, and illegal immigration in a way that culminates in one of the very best cinematic examinations of the milliniem. Set in an irrevicable future in which women can no longer have children, Children of Men, adapted from P.D. James' book, reminds us -- with heightened intensity -- where our problems today could put us twenty years down the road. Top-notch performances and a crisply cut script, delivered via the depressingly beautiful backdrop of a dying country, amount to a devastating experience, impacting anyone with a pulse and tapping into the great watchful minds of the industry's scrutinizers with a powerful message: What's to come of mankind in twenty, fifty or a hundred years? I haven't the slightest clue. However, as long as we're given tidy diversions such as this, I'll be satisfied.</p></body></html>

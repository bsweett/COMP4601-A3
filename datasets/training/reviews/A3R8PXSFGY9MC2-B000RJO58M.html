<meta name="summary" content="Hot Fuzz"></head><body><p>'Hot Fuzz' is basically the story of a big time policeman who is transferred to a sleepy country village and tries to settle in there. He starts to notice some unusual accidents around village life and starts to investigate them with both hilarious and chilling (as far as the film is concerned) consequences. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are both excellent in this film and I found it to have a lot more laugh out loud moments in it than 'Shaun of the Dead'. Pegg is his funniest when he is being frustrated and pedantic when not utilizing his top policing skills in this sleepy, laid back village. Frost reminds you of a big soppy dog, as he eagerly learns from Peggs character and tries to emulate him, often to hilarious effect. Overall this is a fun film, with many hilarious scenes and gags, and although some of the violent scenes are pretty gross, they take a back seat to the humour in this film. Well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

While the script is the actual star of the film, the cast is exceptional as an ensemble and every actor here is worth mentioning at least once.  But it's the word-play and the situations that these fine actors find themselves in that propells the film forward.  The script is so sharp, in fact, that many times during the movie I felt some of the actors had a hard time keeping up.  Don't take that as a negative criticism because screenplays are rarely this well-written with such a huge cast as its centerpiece.  It just doesn't come together all the time.  I should not forget to mention the outstanding soundtrack, which I'm sure was hand-picked by Cameron Crowe.  He is notorious for his films having fantastic soundtracks.  "Singles," for instance.  I have watched this movie many times and I always laugh and get carried away with the interesting lives of those on tour.  This movie has great acting, an exceptional script, and another great soundtrack.  This is a journey worth taking.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WHITAKER IS SENSATIONAL AS THE PARANOID DICTATOR IDI AMIN"></head><body><p>Based on Giles Foden's novel, THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND tells the story of a Scottish doctor played by James McAvoy who becomes Uganga dictator Idi Amin's personal physician. From this close perch, McAvoy's character (Nicholas Garrigan) is witness to the cruelity and brutality of Amin, played by Forest Whitacker. Mr. Whitaker is no less than sensational as the paranoid, murderous, emotionally immature dictator put in power by the Bristish (or so the film implies). Mr McAvoy at first seems a light weight both physically and dramatically to Mr. Whittaker's overpowering Amin, but as the film proceeds, Mr McAvoy develops a stronger screen presence. THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND is an entertaining peek at some contemporary African history, unfortunately all too often tragic.</p></body></html>

Clearly, we have a much better understanding of terrorists movements such as the nationalist IRA or the various past and present Marxist or Maoist Red Army Brigades than we do of today's super-radical and super-desperate Islamic suiciders. It's difficult to 'get' what motivates young men and women, often well educated and sometimes coming from affluent families to blow themselves up for the dubious (at least to us) reward of taking 'some of us' with them in the process and the few no longer front page newspaper headlines and Tweets. What makes "Traitor" troubling is not its largely successful attempt to show us that there's a lot more than the promise of 72 virgins in Heaven that recruits 'suiciders' but its inability to go beyond hinting at what that might be - to borrow a famous line from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'... Anyone? Anyone? The possible explanations provided by dedicated terrorist Omar - who attended finishing school in Switzerland - that tend to come down to 'they killed many of us so we should kill many of them' may be part of the motive, especially when a family member was tortured or imprisoned or lost but individual revenge can't account for a movement and a cause.<br /><br />With the understanding that "Traitor" is maybe a baby step forward toward an open discussion of what makes 'them' hate 'us' so much and how can 'we' justify us voluntarily surrender so quickly our personal and civil liberties when facing a relatively small threat and in exchange for some largely illusory 'security', it is a tense, generally well acted movie. It's not clear what made Samir, a native of Sudan, join the US Army Special Forces - we see his father dying inside an exploding car but from that to an elite US Army career and then deep cover agent - before or maybe after having fought side by side with the Afghan freedom fighters (now known to us as terrorists) against Russian invaders? Omar, Samir's Islamic Brotherhood terrorist best friend meets him in a Yemeni prison and it's not clear how he ended up there either after completing finishing school in Switzerland. We do hear from Omar that he resents 'the West' for killing and humiliating his brothers and sisters but... from Switzerland to Yemen? Yemen is one of the least likely place to find Westerner targets. The US government agents, especially the FBI, get a more realistic treatment - arrogant, brutal, unable and unwilling to comprehend or adjust to an unfamiliar reality, all too willing to forget about the niceties of actually following our laws when the opportunity to brutalize a US citizen abroad presents itself, sloganeering when there's a need to defend or explain less then honorable activities.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes, it's the expected spy thriller action movie. People are not always who they say they are, there's a lot of deception, a reasonable body count and, in the end, even though 'our side' seems to get the better of it, poor Samir is left trying to figure out for himself if whatever he did was right or even necessary while under intense bombardment from slogans and clich&eacute;s thrown at him by Special Agent Roy Clayton.<br /><br />"Traitor" is not easy to watch. Even hinting at what might be "the other side's" views and motivations tends to make us uncomfortable and, while not really coming close to touching the root causes and motivations for today's Islamic terrorism, it comes close enough to make watching difficult. Sadly, because it only hints at possible causes and motives without fully exposing them, most viewers discussions about what they just watched aren't likely to deviate from the standard, often repeated, short, simplistic, depressing sound bites fed to us by big and loud talking heads that our valuable mass media likes to squeeze between male enhancer pills and diet plan or abs commercials.<br /><br />Since I watched "Traitor" on a Blu-ray disc, it's probably worth noting that there's little in the image where the Blu would offer a significant advantage over a DVD. The dark subject is appropriately painted on the screen with dark shades of brown, gray and yellow and the viewer attention is likely to focus more on the plot and characters interactions than on the largely non-existent vistas. The same can be said about sound - Dolby TrueHD - it's adequate but this story does not call for tremendous surround sound performances. Explosions, even when they happen, are integrated into the context of the story. The Blu-ray package comes with a second digital copy disk which is quite appropriate because watching the movie on a computer screen should be as good an experience as watching it on a home theater.<br /><br />I hesitate to recommend "Traitor" as an outright purchase even though the current Blu low price (8.99) should make it tempting. I did buy my copy and I am probably going to keep it. However, if in doubt, you're probably better off renting it and HD vs. DVD resolution won't make a big difference.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Arnold Plays The Villain"></head><body><p>Here's another film from the 1980s that has reached "classic" status. Unlike some of the other popular movies of its day, this one had two sequels that both were successful, particularly the second. As I write this, there's a fourth Terminator just out on the silver screen.<br /><br />In retrospect, what makes this "Terminator" different is that Arnold Schwarzenegger was the villain, not the hero, as he was in the next two Terminator movies.<br /><br />Here, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are the "good guys." The now famous phrase by Arnold, "I'll be back." comes from this film. Hamilton, meanwhile, also was different, with a shapely figure and a fairly nice person, unlike the ultra-thin and coarse woman she was in the first sequel.<br /><br />Played mostly for violence and special effects, the film is a bit rough and sleazy in parts but certainly was popular because, like most of Arnold's film, it flat-out entertains.<br /><br />I've been debating about buying the Blu-Ray but have held off because of conflicting reviews on it, most of them being negative about the transfer.</p></body></html>

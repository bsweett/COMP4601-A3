<meta name="summary" content="Dark, somber, meticulously crafted. One of 2002's best"></head><body><p>"Road to Perdition" is brilliantly conceived by director Sam Mendes ["American Beauty"] and stunningly photographed by the late Conrad Hall, whose illustrious career garnered him two Oscars and ten nominations. One of those nominations is for this film. Tom Hanks, Paul Newman and Jude Law, among others, give great performances. It is among the best movies of 2002, but it is only fair to warn potential viewers that this is no lighthearted joyride. It is an unrelentingly dark and somber tale; `perdition', after all, is another word for hell. <p>The year is 1931, the place is a small town not far from Chicago. Prohibition has spawned a nation of thugs and gangsters. Legitimate businesses have become hubs of criminal activity. The town is run by a ruthless Irish family headed by John Rooney [Paul Newman] His real son, Connor [Daniel Craig], is his cynical, hot-headed heir, and his adopted son, Michael Sullivan [Tom Hanks], is his enforcer. A great rivalry exists between the two sons. One rainy night, one of the Michael's boys, twelve year old Michael Jr. [Tyler Hoechlin], hides in his father's car and goes along on a job. What he witnesses forever changes his life, puts the rest of his family in mortal danger, and gives John the perfect opportunity to rid himself of his rival. It also gives Michael Sullivan his only chance to see that his son does not become like him. <p>The movie is beautifully rendered in dark tones, giving it the look of a nightmarish dream. This is appropriate because the story is told from the boy's point of view and is a memory from his childhood. <p>"Road to Perdition" is not intended to be realistic. It, like the graphic novel it is based on, is a fantasy. It plays like an updated Greek / Shakespearean tragedy, and its mood is almost operatic. From a commercial point of view, it might have benefited from a bit more levity, but I admire Mendes, a true artist, for keeping his vision consistent and true. It is a movie which will be remembered long after most of 2002's releases are forgotten.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Satirical look at how the cigarette industry really markets to us is smokin"></head><body><p>Based on a best-selling 'insider' novel of the same name, this film examines how the multi-million dollar tobacco industry promises one thing to the public and then privately does another.<br /><br />People who would be 'crying foul' with almost any other industry are actually convinced the tobacco industry is on their side. It is an unspoken truth that Big Tobacco's 'anti-smoking' initiatives are actually enticing kids to try--and become hooked on their products. Constantly producing a new generation of consumers (especially important when you are producing a product whose only result is to kill people!) is very important for this industry.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart stars as Nick Naylor, Vice President of and the chief spokesman for the Academy of Tobacco Studies, a tobacco lobby funded by cigarette companies to "research" the links between smoking cigarettes and health. Naturally because this is an in-industry organization, no links are ever made--and his other job requires him to defend 'smokers rights'.<br /><br />After a 'skull and crossbones' bill is proposed, Nick suggests that Hollywood do their part to publicize smoking again, people seeing their favorite stars light up will think it is 'cool'. The dichotomy between this, his membership in the self-referenced Merchants Of Death (M.O.D. Squad) and then attempts to build a loving relationship with his son Joey (Cameron Bright) are wide. He is not a moral man, but Naylor is not subhuman scum either.<br /><br />Other powerful performances are delivered by Katie Holmes. She plays investigative reporter Heather Holloway, skeptical of M.O.D. Squad. An article she writes ultimately allows Nick to really light up his son's life.<br /><br /> Everybody needs to see this film at least once if they want to understand the full power of marketing upon the human psyche and the political power of effective advertising. This film isn't an anti or pro-smoking diatribe so much as an examination of industry marketing techniques with the industry being examined just happening to be tobacco.</p></body></html>

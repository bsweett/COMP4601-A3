This is a movie, people, not a documentary. So going off that I will say that I really enjoyed this, it is very entertaining. I liked its gritty, sweaty, realistic style. Top notch cinematography, especially in the way the slow-mo's show dirt leaping off the ground or top of a car as the I.E.D.'s detonate and also when shell casings bounce off the ground. Good directing, good acting, just an all around good movie in my opinion. I saw it on DVD but I'm sure it looks even better on BD. 5 stars, Highly Recommended.</p></body></html>

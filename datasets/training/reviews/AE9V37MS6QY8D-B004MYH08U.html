<meta name="summary" content="Not the greatest superhero adaptation but still entertaining"></head><body><p>While I really liked this film, it definitely wasn't one of the best comic adaptations I've seen. Seth Rogen was efficient in mixing drama with humor, but the real star was Jay Chou as Kato! Britt Reid (Rogen) may be the main hero, but Chou owned this movie! Christoph Waltz (who took his hokiness to an entirely new level) was only OK as the villain, and Cameron Diaz was sort of a mere sidenote character. It's as if the writers (Rogen and friend Evan Goldberg) just said, "Well, I guess we have to put an attractive love interest in here somewhere." But her part -- which may seem integral -- could have been played by anyone and wasn't really all that important, as someone else in the cast could've easily brought to the table the knowledge that her character had. In fact, I wish they had gotten an actress a little younger (or at least around Rogen's age -- her 38 to his 27) and/or a little more unknown; Diaz just seemed all wrong for the part. Nevertheless, Rogen and Goldberg did a decent job with tackling a tough genre; say what you will but it's damn tough to write a decent comic movie adaptation. Definitely entertaining and well worth viewing!</p></body></html>

We immediately know how it ended right at the start of the movie but what makes it extraordinarily gripping is the series of events that led to its real denouement.  The 'twist' at the end of the film (which is actually the start of the entire movie) explains all the why's &amp; how's you may have felt while watching it.  Moreover, watching it the 2nd time around makes you comprehend more.  You realize that you missed something during your 1st viewing, &amp; watching it again helps you understand the film better.  My husband &amp; I have seen it twice, &amp; we still debate as to what has actually transpired.  Isn't that amazing?</p></body></html>

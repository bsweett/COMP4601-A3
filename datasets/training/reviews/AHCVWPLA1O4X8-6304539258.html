<meta name="summary" content="This release is not worth owning, even if you're a die hard"></head><body><p>I love the original Star Wars movies.  I owned them on the original VHS release.  When Lucasfilms released the trilogy on VHS in the `special' THX format I was more than happy to oblige, and bought the entire trilogy.  Then came the special extended versions of the movies-great!  I saw those in theaters and rushed to buy them when they came out on VHS.  I missed the Laserdisc version and didn't buy anything else on VHS, but then came the DVD release of the trilogy (the extended versions of the film).  Hey, I thought, I already own these movies in 3, yes 3, versions.  But what the heck-Lucas and co. are saying they'll never release the original versions of the film on DVD anyway, so why not make it 4?<br /><br /> Now we're looking at yet another release of the films.  This is promised to be a "Limited Edition," which probably means it will only be out until demand subsides and they can release another version.  If this were a new Dolby or Hi Def release of the original movies I may consider them, but its not.  It's a rehashed release of the Laserdisc version of the films from 13 or so years ago, hideously outdated and ignorant of the technological advantages of DVD.  I'm not going to bite on this release-I've had enough for the time being.<br /><br /> When (and to me it's a question of when, not if) Lucas finally decides to put forth a bit of effort and release Episodes IV-VI in a format that's not 15 years outdated I'll buy, though by this point I feel I shouldn't.  But I see no reason to buy this release.  Before the first DVD version came out Lucas said he wouldn't release the original films on DVD until after Episode 3-that turned out to be a lie.  Then he said he'd never release the original theatricals on DVD-that, too has proved untrue.  I'm fairly certain that we'll get a new version of the theatrical releases soon, maybe one that will be worth owning.  Until then I can be patient-Lucas is apparently so willing to bleed his die-hard fans dry that the only true "definitive" release of the films will be the one Lucas does right before he, himself, passes on.  Only then will these poor, tired classics get a rest.</p></body></html>

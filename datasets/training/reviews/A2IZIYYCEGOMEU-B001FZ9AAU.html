<meta name="summary" content="A VERY SOLID SCREEN ADAPTATION"></head><body><p>IRON MAN moved along at a break-neck pace, and for the most part, the plethora of CGI effects were never allowed to clobber some of the first-rate acting by Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow. There was also some extremely funny dialogue, and excellent physical humor by Downey, who for my money, is far less wooden than most of the super heroes buzzing around screendom these days ( with the notable exception of Ron Perlman ). Fun stuff.</p></body></html>

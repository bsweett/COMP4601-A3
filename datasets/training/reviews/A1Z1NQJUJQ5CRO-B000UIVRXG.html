<meta name="summary" content="Everything you ever wanted to know about HF....and more!"></head><body><p>Hot Fuzz(released Apr/07)stars everyone's fave English sensations Simon Pegg and Nick Frost starring as Constable Nicholas Angel and Constable Butterman,respectively.Pegg and Frost are closerthanthis in real life and they also brought in their friend director/writer Edgar Wright,and when all is said and done they whipped up a winner of a movie.<br />The plot takes place in London,England(I had to say that because I live in that city in Ontario!).Const.Angel is a supercop of sorts,graduating highest in his class from the police academy,earning all sorts of awards in his career and basically showing up every other living and breathing person to put on a cop uniform within the greater London area.One day he is pulled into his superiors offices to be told that he is to be transferred to a sleepy little town miles north of the city,called Sandford.<br />He arrives in town only to almost immediately arrest the entire clientele of a local there,thereby,for all intents and purposes,shutting it down.One of the people he arrests that night happens to be the son of the Police Chief Frank Butterman.The town(and the movie as a whole)is populated with a plethora of off the wall characters and Angel has a tough time of it fitting in.One day he stumbles onto a clue that something is very amiss in Sandford after a local business man gets blown up in his own home,and that the suspected perpetrator might be the owner of a local supermarket.Then the local writer of a newspaper is killed trying to provide Angel with an important clue and Angel soon after witnesses the murder of a shopkeeper,dying horribly by gardening shears.The perp is a hooded figure and when Angel gives chase,as fast as he is,he cannot fathom the  unbelievable speed of the pursued who he loses.<br />Circumstances are now rolling along like an out of control snowball with his colleagues all sneering at his bravado and no one in which to turn to for help.He is jumped upon at his apartment but manages to survive the attack and he eventually uncovers a meeting situated at the old churchyard with all the local business leaders gathered around a table like a witches coven,in hooded garb.He runs but is captured by who he thought was his only friend Constable Butterman,who takes him outside the village to send him packing back to London.As he is about halfway back he is at a rest stop and it is there he decides to stop running and return to clean up the town once and for all.<br />Upon arrival he immediately enters the police station,obtains a load of illegal weapons,straps them on,obtains a horse and rides down the main street to stop near the towns square.Wearing shades and ready for action he is in short order shot at by all of the business people involved in the twisted plot in Sandford.Constable Butterman didn't believe Angel before but he quickly realizes there has to be something to it as he rises to the occasion to help his friend.They take down most of the opposition but the Police Chief and the local supermarket owner escape by car.The Police Chief runs into a tree while Angel and the supermarket owner duke it out in a miniature village.It all ends as the owner gets impaled on a miniature church's steeple.<br />The movie comes to an end as all the towns business men and women involved are arrested and booked and Angel and Butterman,a year on,are close friends and keeping the streets of Sandford safe from any and all criminal element.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable from more than a few different angles,this film is both funny and irreverent and boasts a wonderful supporting cast of actors to help them in their 121 minute romp on celluloid.Timothy Dalton is among the cast and his impalement on the church steeple is nothing short of cringing....ouch! Kind of a turnabout is fair play thing,as it was Dalton's character that sent a church steeple down upon the reporter who was to clue Angel in,earlier in the flick.<br />This three disc set is nothing short of fantastic.The first disc is pretty much what is contained in the single disc release but it gets much better.Into the second disc and third you will discover facts,trivia and behind the scenes info that will keep you enthralled for literally hours,in fact FIVE to be exact!I can't possibly list all the features in detail but generally you are looking at:the video of their pre-release tour of the U.S. with the movie and its reactions at various points along the way with its two main stars and director Wright,and it's,well...you'll just have to watch to see,a plethora of deleted scenes and outtakes,commentaries on almost all the features,eight featurettes,a look at the S/FX,23 vid blogs,a look at Wright's first cop film,many other inside looks at just about every angle of the film making process including stunt driving training for the cars used in the film,etc,etc.Whew! If you loved the film you will love all of this stuff as they couldn't have done it up any better.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 1:85:1 and the picture is clear and crisp,along with the dynamite sound.<br />All in all,this is as good as it gets folks for all fans of this movie;and I can't imagine who wouldn't or couldn't be one.A funny and irreverent look at the life of an overzealous English cop,Hot Fuzz has what it takes to get your adrenaline going but at the same time have you laughing in the aisles.Get it while the getting is still good.</p></body></html>

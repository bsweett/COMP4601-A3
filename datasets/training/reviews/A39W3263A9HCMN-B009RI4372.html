If you think a horror film can't scare you, Look closer.<br /><br />I saw this movie the other night and it rocked. I don't give a flying f*** what it was rated, I loved it! The DVD is incredible. The sound is great (like when Ash is in the cell looking) and it really gets you. The picture is great and its in widescreen. So PEOPLE NEED TO PLEASE STOP B****ING ABOUT THE DVD! IT WAS MEANT TO BE IN WIDESCREEN SO LEAVE IT ALONE!</p></body></html>

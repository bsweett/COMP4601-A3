<meta name="summary" content="A Creepy, Original Masterpiece"></head><body><p>The Orphanage(El Orfanato) tells the story of Laura, her husband, Carlos, and their adopted son, Sim&oacute;n. Laura was adopted herself and spent time at an orphanage when she was younger. She returns to the same orphanage as an adult with her family to do the same thing for handicapped children now that it do for her so many years ago; take care of them until they can find families of their own. Sim&oacute;n isn't much different from other kids his age and has a couple imaginary friends, but it's when he meets a new one one day at the beach in a cave that things start to get strange. There's something more going on. It seems as if the children may have never left after all...<br /><br />The Orphanage is able to accomplish being the creepy masterpiece that every horror film in the past ten years has tried to be. That's not to say there haven't been good horror films in the past ten years, but there are only a handful and this one has to be close to the top. What sets this apart from other horror films is that it doesn't rely on cheap scares or CGI to try and scare the viewers. It's all about the atmosphere and it works so well. In general, I'm not a fan of horror films that are about ghosts. This seems to be on a whole different level though. It's also one of the more original horror films I've seen in quite awhile, which is quite a relief. I'm not sure about you, but I'm kind of sick of sitting through a movie and realizing it reminds me of this movie or this movie or it "pays homage" to three movies in one film. I'm not saying that influences are a bad thing, but originality is so hard to come by these days and I embrace it with open arms. It also seems like whatever movie Guillermo Del Toro is involved with can do no wrong, in my eyes. I know he only produced this film, but still. I've yet to see any movie with his name in the credits that I didn't love.<br /><br />I don't think this film is for everybody though. If you're looking for the next Ring or Grudge or if you're wanting blood spewing from amputated limbs, then you'll probably want to look elsewhere. But if you're looking for an intelligent thriller that is heartbreaking yet beautiful, then I think this is a movie you should look into.<br /><br />Rating: 8/10</p></body></html>

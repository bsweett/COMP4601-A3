<meta name="summary" content="loud, brass, sassy, one of the best of the year"></head><body><p>Dreamgirls is phenomenal, the performences, the music, and some lavish set designs make for one great movie. i still dont know why Dreamgirls was snubbed for Best Picture and Director, that to me is just one big Effie-sized shutout. but that still cant hurt the movies merit. the film, based on the popular Broadway show, tells of the Dreamettes, Deana Jones, Effie White, and Lorrell Robinson who have just been discovered by car salesman Curtis Taylor who is determined to make them famous. when the Dreamettes become backup singers for regional hotshot singer James "Thunder" Jones, there careers suddenly take of and soon, they become the Dreams. however, fame has its price as outspoken Effie begins to disrupt Cutris's plans until she's ousted compeltly and Deana is made lead singer. what follows is what the price of fame will do to best friends and to the ones they love. the music in the film is definenlty in vein with Motown, each number is just full of energy and flare you cant help but get up. all the actors are great but the standouts are definently Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy. Murphy redeems himself after some lackluster films and shows off dramatic chops he hasent bothered to used in years. it still baffels me he lost the Supporting Actor award. but it is Jennifer Hudson's Oscar winning role that steals the show, she totally embodies Effie with all her sass, heartache, and big voice, and i mean BIG voice. when she sings her solo "and i'm telling you i'm not going", she just brings the house down, no she actually destroys the house and sends chills up your spine. take that American Idol! so if you want to see one of the best films of the year, then Dreamgirls is the film for you.</p></body></html>

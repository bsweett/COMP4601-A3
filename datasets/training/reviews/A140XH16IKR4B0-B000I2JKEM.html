<meta name="summary" content="Bringing puppets to life, but a few spots of rot in the script"></head><body><p>"Corpse Bride" is a gruesome addition to the macabre oeuvre of Tim Burton. It tells the story, in stop-motion animation, of Victor and Victoria, a lonely boy and girl who are being forced to wed by their money-grubbing parents. But a chance encounter in graveyard brings back from the dead Emily, the reanimated corpse of a spurned bride. When Victor accidentally slips a ring onto her bony finger, she resolves to wed Victor and bring him back with her to the world of the dead.<br /><br />The sets are terrific, Victorian ghoulishness at it creepy finest. The dead live underground, in a fast-paced society that mirrors the past, complete with bars and dancehalls. The dead themselves are partly and mostly-decayed skeletons that would probably scare the bejesus out of younger kids. Emily is a case in point. One leg and one arm are decayed to bone. Her ribs are visible on one side through her tattered wedding dress. Instead of rouge, one cheek is rotted to black and the other has lost enough flesh to reveal a toothy jaw line. That Burton's puppet master manage to make her look sexy shows their mastery of the genre. There is wonderful macabre humor is well. At French headwaiter is just that -- the waiter's guillotined head, made mobile by an skittering army of corpse-eating bugs.<br /><br />The film is wonderful in all respects but plotting. The puppets are masterfully rendered in shades of brown (for the loving) and blue (for the dead). The animation is silky and smooth. But a number of plot lines don't make sense -- do not read on if you wish to be surprised! In spite of Emily's forced marriage to another character, there's no real reason that Victor must marry Emily. And there is no reason that Emily should decide to forgo her marriage to Victor when she sees Victoria in the church. And why a certain evil character would choose to drink a death-dealing potion is a mystery. Except that he plot required that he do so.<br /><br />Still, there are many, many wonderful touches to The Corpse Bride. A scene of a character dissolving into butterflies was unexpected, touching and stylistically stunning. The stop motion technique did not prevent the artists from giving the characters expression and life. The story's unique touches (like a boy reunited with his long dead dog) were clever and original and fit the plot perfectly.<br /><br />Almost lifelike, The Corpse Bride's plot could have used just a touch of the mortician's brush to render it restful and at peace.</p></body></html>

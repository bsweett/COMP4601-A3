<meta name="summary" content="An inspiring tale that illustrates how perseverance pays off in the end"></head><body><p>Based on a true story, "The Pursuit of Happyness" is a heartwarming film about Chris (Will Smith), a down on his luck father who is struggling to get ahead in life and provide for his young son (played by Will's real-life son, Jaden Smith). Chris attempts to dig himself out of an unsuccessful career as a salesman and get a job as a stockbroker instead. Seeing as how he has no stockbroking skills, Chris needs to start from the bottom up, and he manages to acquire a prestigious internship with a brokerage firm. Unfortunately the internship is unpaid, and Chris finds himself struggling to secure money for food and shelter. He and his son end up in a homeless shelter, and Chris hopes that his six-month internship will pay off with a job offer in the end.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film. It illustrates how even the most hardworking people can end up on the streets through absolutely no fault of their own. Both of the Smith boys did a great job in the movie, and they had me cheering with them and crying for them the whole way through. What an inspiring movie!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="For these boys, there is no life other than football"></head><body><p>This 2004 film is based on a true story of one year in the 1980s when the Odessa, Texas High School Football Team competed for the state championship.  Billy Bob Thornton is the coach and his acting, as usual, is excellent.  So is that of the cast of young men who play the football players.  It's easy to see why their whole lives are wrapped up in winning this championship.  There's nothing else in this town that will ever give them any glory.  This is their moment and they have to use it to the maximum.<br /><br />This point is brought out over and over again - that for these boys - there is no life other than football.  It is especially demonstrated in the relationship of one of the boys and his father.  The father is an abusive drunk who treats the boy badly because the boy fumbles the ball. It seems that years before, the father was on a winning team and won a state championship ring.  After that, his life had no meaning and he truly believed that if the boy didn't come out of this football season a winner, there would be no other way for the boy to be able to succeed.<br /><br />The script was good and did hold my interest but I felt I had seen it all before.  There's the best player on the team who sustains an injury.  There's the competition between the boys. There's a social life of sorts.  And, of course, there is the tough-love coach who encourages them throughout.<br /><br />The script is good too, maintaining the tension throughout.<br /><br />Sorry though.  I was bored.  Maybe it's because I'm not a football lover.  Maybe it's because even though I understood how much the game meant to the boys, I'm just too far away from the Odessa Texas lifestyle to really feel their passion in my gut. It was a good film too.  Just not for me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Compares favorably with original Blade"></head><body><p>The drawing of comparisons between this film and its predecessor is almost inevitable, and probably a mistake, but we'll go there anyway.  Blade II is bloodier than Blade; Blade II has more action than Blade; Blade II has better composition and effects than Blade; Blade II has a more complex storyline than Blade, yet I still am somewhat partial to the original.  <p>Under the directorial guidance of Guillermo del Toro, we get to see a lot more action and a lot more blood spilled, particularly by the &quot;super vampires&quot; that Blade and the rest of the vampire crew join forces to hunt down.  Although one can almost place bets on the order in which the vampires accompanying Blade will die at the hands of the super vampires, the film still is suspenseful and holds back a few plot twists.<p>The two things I noticed most were del Toro's penchant for over-contrived CG action shots, some of which looked a bit cartoonish, and the completely different feel del Toro evoked.  Where Norrington relied heavily on a more monochromatic gray-black feel with touches of green and blue, del Toro plays more in the red-orange visual spectrum.  This, plus the Prague setting, gives Blade II a very different feel than Blade.<p>I didn't find a great deal of interesting material in the second disc, but the director's commentary is interesting (and amusing) enough to listen to if you can get through del Toro's thick accent.  Particularly funny is his description of an edit that was made to a scene after women's groups complained.  Also of interest is that the scene in question (which occurs in a private room at an adult store) is reminiscent of another David Goyer-scripted scene from Crow: City of Angels.<p>From his commentary, you can tell that del Toro had some dark, messy fun making this film, and that is evident in the splatter-fest that ensues.  Did I mention that del Toro is also less subtle with the gore than Norrington?  Bottom line: equal parts monster and action flick, Blade II delivers in either genre.</p></body></html>

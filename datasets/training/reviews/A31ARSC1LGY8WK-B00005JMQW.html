<meta name="summary" content="Excellent comic-book action film - the best of the Spiderman series"></head><body><p>"Spiderman 2" is the best film in the Spiderman series. Good special effects, an interesting villian, and a decent story come together in a film that will satisfy most actions fans.<br /><br />After a great title sequence, the film has a bit of a shaky start with some forced humor related to a janitor's closet but improves from there on in. Your enjoyment of this film will no doubt depend on your tolerance of Tobey Maguire's klutzy character and the continuing tease around his romance with Kirsten Dunst.<br /><br />Followed by a disastrous sequel.</p></body></html>

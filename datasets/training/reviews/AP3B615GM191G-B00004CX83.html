Over time, though, perhaps due to the comics' appeal to children or the campy 1960s Batman TV series, Batman became a much lighter subject matter, almost rivaling the pristine Superman in terms of heroism.  This 1989 film from Tim Burton that perception, bringing Batman back to his dark roots.<br /><br />In the film, Batman battles the nefarious Joker, who much earlier in life murdered Bruce Wayne's parents and effectively transformed the young Bruce into the Caped Crusader.  However, much time is also devoted to how Jack Napier ultimately (at the hands of Batman himself) becomes the Joker, setting up an interesting character dichotomy.  A love interest (Vicki Vale) is also present for Bruce/Batman which, while never really heating up, does draw out some of the personal demons that haunt Bruce.<br /><br />The acting in this movie also stands out as impressive.  Michael Keaton plays a very introspective and intense Bruce Wayne and is spot-on as the brewing Batman.  Of course, Jack Nickholson steals the show as the psychotic, cackling Joker in a role he seemed born to play.<br /><br />Overall, this film really brings the character of Batman back to its dark, brooding roots.  In typical superhero movie style, Batman features its share of cool gadgets and intense action sequences, but it also contains enough character development to make viewers care about the main storylines.  Essentially, this film put Batman back on the superhero map.</p></body></html>

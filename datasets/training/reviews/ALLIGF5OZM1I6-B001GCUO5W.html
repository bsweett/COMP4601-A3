Reading it in plain text may not sound that cool, but try saying it out-loud with a Boston accent and a rough attitude. Leonardo DiCaprio does in Shutter Island, and it sounds wicked-awesome!<br /><br />DiCaprio plays Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels. His sidekick of a partner is Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), and they are sent to the mysterious `Shutter Island' to investigate the disappearance of a woman.<br /><br />After she drowned her three children in the lake behind her house, Rachel (Emily Mortimer) was sent to this eerie island. It's an insane asylum for the kind of insane people that we love the most in dark and gritty films similar to this; the criminal kind. When she miraculously escapes from her cell, with a barred window and a sealed door locked from the outside; it's up to Teddy and Chuck to track her down. With a horrific storm on the horizon, they don't have much time and chances don't look too bright that she will survive. As if matters aren't bad enough on their own, Teddy is suffering from severe post traumatic stress from his involvement in World War II.<br /><br />The island is very much a huge character in the film. It's comparable to the islands of Deep Rising, King Kong and The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Shutter Island's legendary director, Martin Scorsese, brilliantly introduces the island to us early on in the film. It's massive in size and lurks in its murky waters, surrounded by a heavy thick `turn back now!' fog. It's introduced to us via creepy boat ride and is accompanied by a daunting score, every bit as chilling as those of The Shining and Jaws.<br /><br />As he has for years, Scorsese knows exactly what he's doing with the camera. He captures chilling images that pay homage to Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />The film constantly gets under your skin and makes you repeatedly ask yourself, "What the hell is going on?" It's not hard to follow; it's just bizarre and unsettling. It's no secret that weird things start happening; even if you haven't seen the trailer, you are almost suffocated with this constant vibe from the first scene to the last.<br /><br />The ending is the pay-off. I'm not going to say that the movie is too long, or that it's boring, because it's not in the least. But it is long and you are literally drained by the end of it. It just takes so much out of you. You're left with island fever I guess, and Scorsese has ensured that his island has bogged you down, along with his characters.<br /><br />The film takes us back to the 50s which is always a blast. It's creepy and disturbing but not over the top with the gore. It's cleverly written and I'm sure the novel of which it's based, has sent one or two of its readers to the Looney-bin. It's a fun ride and while it embodies several different elements we've seen a thousand times before (eerie island, insane asylum, post World War II, where'd the girl go? etc.); it boils all of them in a pot together, creating something very unique indeed. The film will surely only get better and better with repeated viewings.<br /><br />The acting is superb, and now that I think about it, the film is also resembles a videogame; Resident Evil, Tomb Raider and Silent Hill come to mind. There are several powerful characters that Teddy visits on his journey, that give him advice or a piece to his puzzle. Ben Kingsley is terrific as the doctor. Mark Ruffalo is very much like a videogame sidekick and you believe he'd do anything at all for Teddy. And Jackie Earle Haley and Elias Koteas play a couple of the island's mentally tormented misfits, astonishingly well. Jackie Earle Haley can be jotted down as a candidate for an Academy Award in the supporting actor category; a flawless performance.<br /><br />Having worked together on Gangs of New York, Aviator, The Departed and now Shutter Island; it's clear that DiCaprio and Scorsese know exactly what they will get from one another. It's pure movie magic as far as I'm concerned; they make one of the best Hollywood duos out there.<br /><br />Here's the first of the potential Oscar candidates for 2010.</p></body></html>

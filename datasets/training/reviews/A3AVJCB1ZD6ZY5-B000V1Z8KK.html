They are not in authorized space.  When asked why, the commander said something to the effect that the men were well trained and they would find their way home.<br /><br />We know one of them did, because we see him years later.  Bob Lee Swagger (Wahlberg) has nearly gone off the grid.  It's just him and his dog living in a remote cabin.<br /><br />When he's approached by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) to help foil a plot to kill the US President by determining how the shooter is going to do it, he reluctantly accepts the job.<br /><br />When the fated day arrives, it's actually the Archbishop of Ethiopia who is shot and the crime's blamed on Swagger.  Swagger goes on the run, trying to find out precisely what happened.<br /><br />"Shooter" is a smart paced and intelligent conspiracy thriller taken from the pen of Stephen Hunter. Excellent acting on the part of the whole crew.  This multi-faceted film is well worth owning.  You will want to see it again.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, December 2008</p></body></html>

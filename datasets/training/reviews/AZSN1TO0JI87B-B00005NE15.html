<meta name="summary" content="There's No Grey Area in "The Fog""></head><body><p>Talk about bad weather! When the fog rolls in on a sleepy coastal village, its townspeople find themselves being stalked by a group of vengeful sea-faring ghosts, whose hundred year slumber has finally come to an end. Strange occurrences pile up as the body-count rises before folks wise up to what is happening, but is it too late to save the town, and more importantly, themselves?<br /><br />A chilling score, spooky atmosphere and an authentic sea-side setting all combine to make this one of the best ghost stories of the 80's and one of writer/director John Carpenter's personal best as well. It also helps that the film is host to one of the ensemble casts in horror history. Carpenter regulars such as Charles Cyphers, Adrienne Barbeau and Nancy Loomis star alongside the likes of Jamie Lee Curtis (reuniting with Carpenter for the first time since "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RIWAVW">Halloween</a>"), Janet Leigh and Hal Holbrook. Heck, there's even 80's horror/cult icon Tom Atkins, who you'll notice is without his trademark mustache. The film itself, like all of Carpenter's best work, moves at a slow pace, bubbling with a sense of dread and mounting suspense before releasing its knockout conclusion.<br /><br />Sandwiched between more celebrated Carpenter classic such as "Halloween," "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783227507">The Thing</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Y87O">Escape from New York</a>", "The Fog" is often overlooked and in turn, is one of the director's most underrated films. Certain aspects of the film might make it appear dated (the cars, the haircuts) but the film still holds up as a classy and thrilling little chiller. Those looking for a thick slice of supernatural suspense will clearly find what they need in "The Fog".</p></body></html>

A little bit of a mix, there. It actually turns out that this is a far below average movie, that fails with every turn, and The Patriot's basic moral is that Hollywood is completely finished with making good war-hero films.<p>Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a South Carolina planter who is still haunted by his notoriously brutal past as a soldier in the French and Indian War. When the American Revolution comes, he chooses not to fight for the Continental Army because he wants to protect his family. But when the British Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs) threatens their welfare and kills one of his sons, he chooses to enlist. Martin becomes the leader of a makeshift militia, which consists of peasants, slaves, a minister, and assorted other irregulars. During the war Martin and his men discover that they will pay a steep personal price for their rebellion. But thanks to their courage and bravery, they are also destined to pay a pivotal role in turning the tide against the Redcoats.<p>The Patriot is an over-long, boring and pointless picture that delivers only in a couple of scenes. The cinematography is quite stunning, but some some un-purposely over-blown performances (especially from Jason Isaacs), messy direction and a premise that could've been written better by monkies don't help The Patriot be the Oscar-worthy film it might've been if the script and direction had been taken into different hands. <p>Disappointing and rarely interesting, The Patriot is a film that makes me proud not to be an American war hero like the characters in this film.</p></body></html>

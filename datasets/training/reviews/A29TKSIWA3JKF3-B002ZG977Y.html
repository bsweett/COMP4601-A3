<meta name="summary" content="I'm sure there was a moral in this somewhere"></head><body><p>Since I like the original film more, I'll not suffer to make any comparisons (as this wasn't a very faithful adaption in any regard, the matter is moot).  I'll just say that I also liked this "same titled movie" and leave it at that.  Besides, any movie with Pete Postlethwaite in it already has a lot going for it.  The man was stellar.<br />What is impressive about this new version is its darker, grubby/grimy look.  It wasn't as pristine as most costume action flicks.  It was also populated by a surly lot (gods and mortals alike, everyone seemed miffed about something), for some reason I found that amusing.  Plus, there were those great monsters, a snakier Medusa, and of course the Kraken.  Loved the star field opening sequence (which I assume was spectacular in 3D).  Since I never saw the 3D version of this film, that isn't an issue for me, I took this film as it was presented: not great, but good enough.  I was entertained.  (I'm very basic that way.)<br />If I have a complaint, it's slight: the owl.  As that owl played a major role in the original film, but was only a brief toss-off in this one, I'm left wondering why it was included: homage or for mocking purposes?  Then too, there was Sam Worthington's (ahem) acting.  I know he spent a great deal of print space bragging how much better this version was then the old film and that he most certainly did NOT want to work with THAT owl...  Those considerations aside, Sam was the only character/actor I couldn't vividly recall after viewing the movie.  He scowled a lot, I remember that, but he lacked presence.  So it's a little disappointing to learn he'll reprise Perseus for the sequel (and possible third film?).  Hopefully by then he'll have realized that even a little personality goes a long way.<br />I will be keeping this film for my collection, but it will NOT go on the same shelf as the original!  No point in adding insult to injury.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Probably David's best"></head><body><p>It's interesting watch Seven because it's quite depressing and bleak with none of that hope at the end of the tunnel hidden away somewhere. It's gritty and realistic. David Fincher manages to make a film with those qualities but without alienating the viewer which is quite a feat. I don't know many people who would watch such a dark film without it being too much so.<br /><br />Detective Somerset is literally 7 days away from retirement. He gets paired up with a new partner, Detective Mills. Their first assignment is a really fat guy who looks like he was fed to death. Somerset realizes that criminals don't take this long to do a murder, the murder has to have a meaning.<br /><br />Mills finds a 2nd body: a lawyer who's had a pound of flesh cut from him. The word Greed is written on the floor. Somerset returns to the fat guy's apartment and finds the word "Gluttony" in grease. A-ha! The killer's using the 7 deadly sins as basis for his murders: Envy, Pride, Lusy, Wrath, Sloth, Lust and Envy. He helps Mills in following the clues so that they can hopefully stop the killer before he completes his 7.<br /><br />Even on repeated viewings, the cat and mouse game they're involved with still seems interested as the killer is always one step ahead, leaving clues that tend to be a little less obvious, such as turning a painting upside down so that the detectives are clued in that there's fingerprints behind the painting.<br /><br />The 2 actors provide a nice counterbalance: Pitt as Mills is brash, abrasive and likes to swear a lot. Freeman as Somerset is very calm, knowledgable and neat. In one of the earlier scenes, Mills wakes up with kind of wrinkly looking clothes and a messy apartment while Somerset has everything ironed, straightened out and everything.<br /><br />As for the films near infamous ending it does come out of left field and isn't the most happiest. Which is quite nice in a film where something actually terrible happens instead of the cop who walks away with just a bullet in his leg while the rest of him emotionally and physically he's fine. The 2 main characters both walk away from this film feeling very affected by what happened.<br /><br />As for parents who are concerned over kiddies watching? Definately do not let them see this. The murders; while never seeing what happened they just show the aftermath of it, are quite violent and brutal. To detail an example: one victim is raped forcibly with a strap-on only the object in the end is quite sharp and knife-like. You don't see anything, you just see a picture, which makes your mind go into overdrive about how painful it must've been, which is a nice touch by Fincher. A lot of times our mind creates the worst imaginable if we can't know what exactly it was.<br /><br />It's a really great film if you're old enough. It's got action and a bit of humor and it's a film that likes to last with you whether you want it to or not.</p></body></html>

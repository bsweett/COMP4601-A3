Director/writer Thurber makes the movie a winner with flying wrenches, a pirate, and the entire cast getting pelted in the face with at least one dodgeball. This movie is tasteless, crass, lowbrow and appeals to the worst in all of us. My worst laughed its tookis off. The David Hasselhoff cameo alone is worth it. Get off your high horse and see this, and break up with anyone who didnt like it.</p></body></html>

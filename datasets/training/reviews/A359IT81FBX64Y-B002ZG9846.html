It makes me feel like such a Big Daddy.<br /><br />What's wrong with all of you adults who love this movie? And what does this movie say about American culture, if the most vulgar and brutal superhero ever to "grace" the big screen is an 11-year-old girl? Kick-Ass is about as "original and fresh" as a beauty pageant with little girls made to parade around like "sexy adults" (such as the 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was, by the way, a victim of real violence).<br /><br />Update: Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl action figure dolls will be available in time for Christmas. Me, I'm hoping they'll come out with a Hit-Girl doll that swears when you punch, kick, and bite her. Can a doll be rated R? :-)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One big fat good time... (Was that too obvious?)"></head><body><p>`My Big Fat Greek Wedding' is not necessarily `laugh-out-loud' funny but it is funny.  I think that all the hype surrounding this film killed it for me the first time I saw it.  It just was not the laugh-riot I was promised.  Now, a few years later, I watched it again for the second time with my wife (one of the ones who over-hyped the film when it was released).  With the hype dead and my initial response to the film a vague memory I can honestly say that the second time around was much more rewarding.  `My Big Fat Greek Wedding' is sweet and sentimental and leaves the viewer with that warm and fuzzy feeling we don't get much anymore.  It just feels right from start to finish.  It's not like it's anything all that `new' to the genre.  Think `Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' with Greeks and Jews.  Despite the `familiarity' it still feels refreshing because it's not your typical comedy.  It's a little more inviting than the average comedy.<br /><br />This feeling of warm invitation is due to the films star (and author) Nia Vardalos, the most unlikely of romantic leads.  I think that's another draw to this film is that the stars look and act like real people (okay, they may act a little stranger than `real' people, but that's half the fun) as apposed to looking like Jessica Alba.  Vardalos plays Toula Portokalos, a thirty-something Greek girl who is still single, slightly overweight and gawky.  In the eyes of her family she's somewhat of a failure.  Toula decides that she is finally going to take her life into her own hands instead of living the life her father has set before her.  That is when she meets Ian, a handsome Jewish man that is everything she's ever dreamed of and everything her family would never condone.<br /><br />Nia Vardalos captures the downtrodden Toula perfectly, drawing the audience into her troubles, always remaining that sweet girl we want to see end up happy.  John Corbett is effective as Ian, handsome and genuine.  We understand why Toula loves him so much.  Lainie Kazan plays Toula's mother with such genuine warmth she'll have you wishing that she were your mother, and Michael Constantine does a great job of making his eccentric and overbearing father come across understandable and likable.  To me though, and just about every other person I speak to, the standout here is non other than Andrea Martin who steals the show with her comedic timing.  Her whole `twin' scene makes this movie worthy of your DVD library.<br /><br />`My Big Fat Greek Wedding' is truly a lovely film.  If you were anything like me and expected so much that you were disappointed the first go around I urge you to give this one another try.  Its warmth and genuine free spirit make `My Big Fat Greek Wedding' not the funniest comedy out there but one of the most likable.</p></body></html>

What she discovers is quite shocking. That's all that I will tell you about the story.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS: WHAT'S WITH ALL OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS?!!!?!? Come on! This was a great film! It was spooky, had a great atmosphere, and it had an original story! And to anybody that says, "Ringu is better", well, Ringu is a great foreign film, but I like the Ring better. Maybe because I'm used to English. After all, The Ring was more chilling than Ringu.<br /><br /> PS. There is an Easter Egg on the main menu of the DVD. Press 6 on the menu. Something cool will happen!</p></body></html>

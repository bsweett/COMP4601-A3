Last year I believe a cable station had A Christmas Story Marathon. They just ran the movie over & over & over. The dvd version with commentary might be interesting. Indeed you can have this on in the background while you wrap presents, cook, address cards etc. pausing everytime the wicked witch or Santa Claus  says to Ralphie, "You'll shoot your eye out." Lots of touchstones of the time: a ditsy stay at home mom, radio shows, getting your mouth washed out with soap, hunting for the perfect Christmas tree. Darren McGavin is not exactly Ward Cleaver as the gruff, profane, childish but lovable old man. If this movie wasn't already a Christmas classic it could be a cult film.</p></body></html>

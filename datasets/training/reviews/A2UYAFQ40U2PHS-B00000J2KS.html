It's always a toss up between this film and 2001: A Space Odyssey over which Kubrick film is better (2001 is winning right now).  It was a bit heady for a high school teen (even one like me who was already searching out intelligent cinema), but I always thought it was a masterpiece.  Many people talk (and talk) about its violence, and they usually miss the satire and the sadness of the story.  McDowell gives his best performance ever, and Kubrick proves why he is the master that he is.  You feel real empathy for Alex, despite his being a monster (or just a man who embraces his dark nature).  I feel that there's an actual point to all the violence in the film.  Just one small quip: I didn't like the trough scene (even though upon further reflection, it is an ironic scene in that Alex attacked Dim and Georgie earlier in the film at a marina filled with dirty water).  There's no way Alex would have been able to hold his breath under the water because he gets sick whenever violence is done upon him.<br /><br />Most people who see the film love this film for the violence, and ignore the substance of the film.  I am not one for liking films that are just violent for violence sake.  The film is a film of ideas as well as emotions.  It's about free will, the power of the state, the true nature of man, etc., etc..  It's another challenging piece of cinema from one of the greatest directors of all time.  Amazingly, the film was shot almost exclusively on location in the UK.  There were only 4 sets built (the milkbar, a mirrored hall, a mirrored bathroom, and the prison reception area).  All of the supporting performances are excellent (with special mention going to Anthony Sharp as the Minister of the Interior, Michael Bates as the Chief Guard, Patrick Magee as the writer, and Warren Clarke as Dim).  Most of you probably know this already, but the huge man servant that the writer has later in the film is David Prowse, who played Darth Vader in the first 3 Star Wars films.  And let's not forget Philip Stone, an actor who appeared in 3 Kubrick films (perhaps a record, there are many actors who appeared here that appeared in other Kubrick pictures, like 2001 and Barry Lyndon).  Another aspect of this film I love is that it's so quinessentially British.  If you didn't know Kubrick was an American, you'd swear it was directed by an Englishman. O nly a handful of films have done that, where the director immerses himself so much in a foreign culture that his film makes you think he's lived there his whole life.  Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala and Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice are like that.  They were so quinessentially Russian and Swedish films, despite being directed by a Japanese man and a Russian man.<br /><br />This 2 disc edition has some fascinating extras, including a great documentary called Still Tickin':  The Return of Clockwork Orange.  Sam Mendes (director of American Beauty) is one of the commentators, and he says this film is remarkable because Kubrick really trusts the audience, and that most directors don't do that today.  Never in the film is there any attempt to sentimentalize or moralise in any way.  Kubrick makes no moral judgements here, which increases the film's power.  There is also commentary by Alex himself, Malcolm McDowell.  He shares the good times and the bad times, but all with great affection.  He had a minor falling out with Kubrick after this film, but that seems to have dissipated.<br /><br />This is still a deeply unsettling, scary, thought provoking film, one that deserves every accolade it gets.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Devil Wears Prada"></head><body><p>`The Devil Wears Prada' is a pretty inoffensive chick flick that manages to stand out from the crowd and keeps you engaged without being too schmaltzy or overly `Hollywood'. Following Ann Hathaway's character, Andy, who is an aspiring journalist, with minimal fashion sense, who joins a fashion magazine as the PA to the ogre of a boss (played by Meryl Streep) this film is quickly set up for plenty of laughs and over the top fashion flamboyance. I've found Hathaway quite annoying in past films but she is actually very good in this film and plays her part very well. Streep's other PA is also hilarious with her back biting and sniping. Andy is asked to perform various outrageous tasks for her demanding boss and soon struggles to juggle home and work life and this leads to the crux of the film. How will she resolve her dilemma whilst maintaining her integrity? This film has some good laughs and cutting sarcastic wit from Streep and is good for a couple of hours viewing. It is easy going, not too heavy and great for a lazy afternoon. It may be pretty innocuous but it never tried to be too high brow or anything other than what it is, simple chick flick fun.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very Funny"></head><body><p>Mike Judge, creator of the Milton comic strips and the TV series<br /><br />King of the Hill (and Beavis & Butthead) has never been a favorite of mine. But I've heard many good things about Office Space and I see why. This was a terrific, funny, and entertaining movie. The film is very funny (a lot of it is subtle humor and it's charming). Ron Livingston plays Peter, a typical working man who works at Initech but hates his job which he views as merely sitting in a cubicle. He works along with two very funny co-workers;<br /><br />Michael Bolton (David Herman), no relation to the pop star and Samir (Ajay Naidu). After a strange experience with a hypnotist Peter decides he's just not going to go to work and stay at home. Then he gets a sexy girlfriend Joanna (Jennifer Aniston) and gets promoted. The film also includes the character that inspired the movie Milton (Stephen Root, Dodgeball) who is a mumbling idiot who was laid off from Initech months ago but continues to recieve a paycheck due to a glitch in the system...As I said it's subtle humor. One part that I found hilarious was when Michael is sitting in his car rapping along to this hardcore gangster rap, really getting into it and when a black man walks past his car he locks the door.

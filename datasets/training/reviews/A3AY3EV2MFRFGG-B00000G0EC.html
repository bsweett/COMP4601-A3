<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg's shallow thrill ride."></head><body><p>Jurassic Park, while exciting and awesome in parts, is no Jaws.  The movie is really an excuse for Spielberg to mount the greatest Ray Harryhausen movie never made, and he succeeds far too brilliantly.  The commentary and conscious of Crichton's terrifying novel is disposed of in favor of easy thumbnail sketch characters and simplistic narrative tools to make the monster movie machine hum right along.  Once the dinosaurs do get loose the movie drops any pretense of developing or even caring about the 'characters' and invites the audience to simply enjoy the spectacle of the attacks.  The pioneering effects may make this an essential in some collections, but the lack of dramatic weight makes it no more effective that its 1950s drive-in cinema cousins The Black Scorpion or The Deadly Mantis.  Recommended just for the thrill of it all.</p></body></html>

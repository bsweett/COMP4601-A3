<meta name="summary" content="The GREAT Sidney Lumet Strikes Again!"></head><body><p>The amazing career of Sidney Lumet is Hollywood legend, and at age 82, he's as fresh as ever. He's transcended the current trends, whether the "in your face" drama of the 50's (12 Angry Men), faithful adaptations of great plays (Long Day's Journey into Night), powerful irony of the 70's (Network), and now the popular and effective "flash-back" ideas of the 2000's. Each one is character driven to the max, and his choice of actors is always right-on. p>"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a riveting account, thanks to writer Kelly Masterson, and a brilliant cast led by P.S. Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, Albert Finney, and ALL involved. Mr. Lumet controls the mayhem with a sure hand and total understanding of his material. That this film was totally ignored at the Oscars escapes me, though many critics included this in their Top 10 list, not to mention a few that gave it Best Ensemble Cast recognition. The editing is exceptional. p>The DVD is fine, with some good extras and a great commentary from Messrs. Lumet, Hoffman & Hawke. Definitely worth a look.</p></body></html>

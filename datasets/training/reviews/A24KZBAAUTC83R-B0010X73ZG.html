<meta name="summary" content="MIST Movie is one of Stephen King's Best!"></head><body><p>I just saw The Mist on Demand, and was very pleasantly surprised at the solid popcorn movie outing I purchased. After seeing all the bad reviews, along with the piss-poor Box Office non-payoff this made, I actually thought this was definately one of the BEST Stephen King-novels-turned-into-movie adaptations in quite a while.<br /><br />Solid acting cast. along with good special effects and a solid storyline, all made a exciting and fun Saturady night movie night for us.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not Suspenseful + Not engaging and exiciting as Terminator 2"></head><body><p>- The special effects are not as exciting as Terminator 2.<br /><br />- There's no suspense in this movie. Terminator 2 is suspenseful from the beginning till the end.<br /><br />- There are a lot of actions but they're not engaging as those of Terminator 2 either.<br /><br />- It was supposed to be touching at the end when someone scarified to give his heart to another person but I was not moved. I don't know it's because of bad directing or acting. It might be both.</p></body></html>

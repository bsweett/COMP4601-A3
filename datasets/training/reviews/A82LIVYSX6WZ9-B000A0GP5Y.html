<meta name="summary" content="stick with the original 1974 movie friends...this ones a dud"></head><body><p>This year there's some remakes that didnt make the cut (The Amityville Horror which was like the boring original) and there's one in mind that did (Assault On Precinct 13 which wasnt that bad) and unpcoming one's (The Pink Panther, King Kong...etc). The Longest Yard is one of the ones that didnt make the cut and which is utterly stupid with some funny one liners in it but otherwise its a Adam Sandler/Peter Segal failure. Sandler (Spanglish) plays ex-quaterback Paul Crewe who's career went down the toilet after he shaved points on a football game...so, he takes his bitchy girlfriends car, that would be Courtney Cox Arquette (Friends), in a drunken manner he piles 5 or 7 police cars ontop of one another and winds up going to prison...a country prison which a footballl fanatic Warden, played by James Cromwell (Babe). The guards are real nasty to its inmates and Sandler finds that out the hard way as he fights and gets into mischief. So, Warden Cromwell tells Sandler to make a team of inmates to play football against his guards and so Sandler does so with the help of the caretaker, played by Chris Rock (Madagascar) in a throwaway role and old timer Coach, played by Burt Reynolds (Dukes Of Hazzard) who played Sandler's part in the 1974 original. Not much fun here, with the usual Sandler raunchiness this comedy tries to take itself serious in some parts but its all too laughable when it does and most of the cast is rendered dumb. Also starring Rapper Nelly (Snipes) who cant act worth crap, Dallas Cowboy Wide Reciever Michael Irvin who is right along with Nelly, William Fichtner (Armageddon), Brian Bosworth (One Man's Justice), Bill Goldberg (Universal Soldier 2), Stone Cold Steve Austin, Tracy Morgan (SNL), Nicholas Tuturro (NYPD Blue) and a cameo by Rob Schneider (Deuce Bigalow Movies). Some people might find this entertaining but I certainly dont. Stick with the original people....hey Burt, what the hell man?</p></body></html>

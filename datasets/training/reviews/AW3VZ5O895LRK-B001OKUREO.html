So I started off viewing this movie expecting to see W skewered.  I am pleasantly surprised that did not happen.  Instead, I saw a complex portrait of the shaping of a man and a president over many years.  I won't go as far as to say I am now sympathetic to Bush but I understand him and his choices better now. First, I was surprised to see how poorly W wore the Bush mantle.  It was clear that everything W did was less than his father or grandfather or brother Jeb or any other Bush had done.  He couldn't fail to miss this as his parents told him this constantly.  What Bush senior failed to see though was that W could get in touch with the common man yet hold onto the elitist ones with some very conflicting personality traits.  He became a born again Christian as a way of coping with his substance abuse problems.  Somehow he managed to blend being born again with being a guy who had been to all the right schools, joined all the right clubs and gravitated to all the right people for his time in history. His parents were repelled by some of his choices: his being born again set up their Episcopalian backs plus his use of the death penalty repeatedly as governor of Texas was not something they'd want sitting in their own personal biographies.  Clearly, Phi Beta Kappa Jeb who behaved like a true Yale man was more the Bush son they liked to embrace.  Yet the very way W talks in his down home voice, loves baseball and follows it religiously, is a guy anyone would "like to share a beer with" and is the life of the party at any frat party or down home barbeque--all of this serves W very, very well with the voters.  In short, he is not off putting like the rest of the elitist Bushes. W seems to genuinely love his country and wants to restore it to bigness.  He goes about this more like a guy who owns a baseball team than a President, which is actually what he did for a living and what he loved doing.  Thus, by the end of the movie when he is in the outfield with his mitt, eternally ready to catch that long baseball hit, the look on his face is one of total all out bewilderment. He is also entirely alone out in the outfield.  This is W by the end of his presidency in a nutshell.<br /><br />Actually, W's underlings come off a lot worse than he does in this film.  Right at the top of the heap of awfulness is Richard Dreyfus playing Cheney and, boy, does Dreyfus nail Cheney as a character.<br /><br />I should have realized Oliver Stone could pull this off.  Josh Brolin does a heck of a job as W.  He has become an incredibly fine actor and I am looking forward to each and every performance of his.  I liked this movie the first time but I thought it was terrific the second time. Oliver Stone rarely disappoints as a film director.  A lot of people detest him but they fail to view him solely as a film director, rather than as an obnoxious personality in real life. He shoots himself in the foot every time he opens his mouth off set and would do himself a big favor if he stopped giving interviews.  As a director, he is still one of our finest talents.</p></body></html>

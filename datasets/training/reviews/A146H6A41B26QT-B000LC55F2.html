In this story a finale goes terribly wrong, and two partners embark on a deadly rivalry to be the first to perform the ultimate trick. The plot twists and turns in ways I certainly couldn't forsee, but I left the film not only puzzling over what had really happened, but more interestingly, wondering what was going on inside the heads of these two men as they lived the lives they had created for themselves. There's no real winner here; rather we see a tense pyschological battle that leads to more than one deadly end. Comparisons to "The Illusionist" are inevitable, but these are two entirely different movies. Enjoy them both!</p></body></html>

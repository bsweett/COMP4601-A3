<meta name="summary" content="one of the most horrifying films ever"></head><body><p>one of my most favorite films of all time, The Silence Of The Lambs is a terrfying look into the mind of one of the most diabolical villians of all time, Hannible Lecter. Clarice Starling is a FBI trainee who is assigned by her boss Jack Crawford, to help in the case of Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who skins his victoms. in order to do that, she must get the help of criminal mastermind Hannible Lector. it is then Clarice will enter the mind of the good docter and will experience something so horrifying, she will never be the same again. Jodie Foster is at her prime in this film, perfectly embodying the strong and fearless Clarice but the film definently belongs to Anthony Hopkins who's potrayl of Hannible Lector is spine chilling yet sophisticated, giving him that sense that he is always four steps ahead of you and that you are powerless against him. the rest of the cast also deliver great performances and the movie makes a flawless adaptation from book to big screen. sure, the Lector series has gone a bit stale in the past sixteen years since it was made but despite that, this film is the real deal and will leave you breathless by the end. so one of my favorite films, enjoy the delicacy known as the Silence of the Lambs.</p></body></html>

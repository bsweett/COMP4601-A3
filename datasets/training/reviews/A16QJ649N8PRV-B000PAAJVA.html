<meta name="summary" content="One of the Great Ones"></head><body><p>'The Patriot' is a superb war story about the American Revolutionary War.<br /><br />It features superb acting by Mel Gibson (as Col. Benjamin Martin), Heath Ledger (Gabriel Martin) and Jason Isaacs as British Col. William Tavington.  The supporting cast does a great job as well.<br /><br />This one is set in South Carolina in 1776-1781.  Martin is a widowed farmer who is just trying to raise his children while the patriots of the area are preparing for war.  He wants no part of it but is forced into it by by the brutal killing of his young son and other atrocities by Tavington.  The Tavington character seems to be based on General Banastre Tarleton well known for his atrocities.  Lest readers worry that the film is falsely portraying the Brits, that is not the case.  Most of them are portrayed as noble warriors, but Tavington (Tarleton) deserves his place in infamy.<br /><br />Also, this is not as documentary.  It is a work of fiction that is very well done.<br /><br />This is highly recommended for anyone who loves a great war movie, particularly one about the Revolutionary War which is seldom depicted in the movies.</p></body></html>

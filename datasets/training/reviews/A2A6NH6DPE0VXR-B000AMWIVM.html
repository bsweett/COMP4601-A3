<meta name="summary" content="Starts out more promising than it ends."></head><body><p>Saw is a movie that starts out stylish and smart and gets silly and dumb before it ends. When watching the beginning and middle I thought "how could Richard Roeper call this one of the worse movies of 2004". Then as it gets closer to the end I thought "ok I get it now, that's why". Carey Elwes (Kiss the Girls) gives about the same bad performance that Kim Basinger did on Cellular. It's overly dramatic and just laughable. Still entertainly laughable at least.<br /><br />  Anyway the movie is about a killer who gets people to kill themselves trying to escape. They are people who have wanted to kill themselves and he gets them to fight to try to live. The movie is entertaining through-out even if it does lose it's touch a little at the end. It starts out as a good mystery/horror film and becomes just  laughably bad entertaining at the end.  Still it is a lot better than most recent horror films that came out recently.</p></body></html>

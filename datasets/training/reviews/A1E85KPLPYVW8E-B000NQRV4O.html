<meta name="summary" content="How could a film this raunchy be so boring?"></head><body><p>With a film so foul mouthed, where every other word is something you'd hear on most triple-x sites, and with Natalie Portman scripted as a stripper, it's quite a surprise how boring and ineffective this film was.<br /><br />The film involves four people: a failed author turned obituary writer, a photographer, a successful dermotologist and an ex-stripper. They all end up in relationships with one another, and there's countless times where they would cheat on each other, leave one for another, get back with the old person, and break up again and use sex to hurt eachother. What was the point here? Maybe it was that these characters had confused love for sex? I'm not for sure, but it made for an extremely boring, uneventful and repetitive hour and 40 minutes.<br /><br />For me, when the story really started to dissipate anything interesting, was towards the beginning when the writer (Jude Law) has cyber sex with the doctor (Clive Owen), pretending he's the photographer named Anna (Julia Roberts) for whom he is in love. And by getting back at Anna for not wanting to be with him, he sets up a date with the perverted doctor and tells him to meet "her" somewhere, a place he know Anna often visits. The most ridiculous part was when the doctor approaches Anna thinking he's meeting her for a sex date (knowing what she looks like from the description the writer gave him online) and she has no idea what he is talking about. She then tells him that he is the victim of a practical joke set up by a man. But then she ends up marrying him. So let me get this straight.....Anna marries a man that she met on a date that was set up by two men (the doctor unknowingly) having cyber sex. How stupid and unbelieveable does it get?<br /><br />Other than being a boring waste of time, the movie had some okay acting from all the actors and between all the sex talk, there was some good and catchy dialogue between the characters. Other than that I really see no reason to give this film more than two stars</p></body></html>

'Jeff' Jeffries (James Stewart) is a photographer who broke his leg getting an exciting picture for his magazine.  As a result he has been stuck in his apartment for 7 weeks getting better and has one more to go.  He is dating Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) but he doesn't want to marry her and he doesn't want to change his life to adapt to what married life would be like.  <p>When Jeff believes his neighbor, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), killed his wife, Mrs. Anna Thorwald (Irene Winston), he begins an intrigue that sucks in Lisa and several others and only ends when Lars comes into Jeff's apartment and nearly kills him.  <p>My Comments:<br />Either it is me aging or Hitchcock aging, but Hitchcock seems to get better the older I get.  The movie was fun to watch and the acting was pretty good.  Jeff's nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) was also a lot of fun, offering the wisdom of a wise woman's life in the time it takes to rub a man's back.  The set was brilliant (the entire story takes place in an a group of apartments).  And, perhaps best of all were the relationships that played out between the cast members.  There was love and loss and loneliness and rejection.  It was all there.<p>I never really felt any tension in the movie, but then again that could have been because there were moments when it was slow and I just didn't identify all that well with the characters.  But the film was very enjoyable nonetheless.  Great Hitchcock.  Also, the DVD special features were very informative and included interviews with most of the cast.</p></body></html>

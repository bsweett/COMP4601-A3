<meta name="summary" content="GOOD EFFECTS BUT DISSAPOINTING."></head><body><p>I have beendying to see this film since it came out in the cinema, i never actually sawit in the pictures just in case i couldn't stand it therefore would have to sit through it all. Anyway, i enjoy watching disaster films as they are made brilliantly and it makes you see what happens in real life, and of course there's a lot going on in them like dante's peak. I expected the same in this, it is nothing like i thought it was going to be though now i have had it. I suppose i will get a little bit used to it. Some of the actions in the film are great but others by looking at them you can tell they are computer imaged. Basically it's about tornadoes, a massive tsunmi sort of thing and there's a lot goin on but i didn't particuarlly like the acting in it or anything. Buy i would highly recommend it for the aduts.</p></body></html>

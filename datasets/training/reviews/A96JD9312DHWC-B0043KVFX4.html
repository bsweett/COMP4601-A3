<meta name="summary" content="More Zombies than you can shake an Umbrella At."></head><body><p>The Umbrella Corporation, a veritable Wal-Mart mixed-bagging it with Boeing, has unleashed something that will eventually murder the world. Unfortunately for the human race, it was not the cross-species horror that demolished hope or the bony fingers of the undead that picked away the last shreds of civilization. It was the fact that the Earth was a victim, too, and this process of victimization left the world a desert with humanity flickering in the breeze.<br /><br />As far as a continuation, I found the movie likeable and hope people understand that this is a sequel work off information passed down from a prior sequel. Accordingly, it is not Resident Evil and it does not have Raccoon City to work with anymore. Raccoon City is actually a tomb now, nuked for those who omitted it from their mental radar, and the spread of the T-virus follows what any layman would register as a "catastrophe and then some." This means that the world went from the happy tinge of forests and foothills and turned a shade of red, infected and to the point that humanity had lost. This means that people survive by not following conventions: Instead of stopping they avoid planting roots and have developed a convey system. Instead of raiding big depots of their former lives they always avoid large cities, hoping to stay away from concentrations of the dead because even a forest of bullets could not keep that many teeth at bay. Fortunately for them, this has worked in some ways and the little towns they scavenge have kept the tired convey rolling. Unfortunately for them, they also face another threat --- Umbrella is far from dead and needs Alice.<br /><br />On the plus side of the movie, everyone is here. Our comedian, our shout-out to the videogame, our Alice; every loose end is here and in play. Everyone save Alice has built a convoy and is practicing the "stay on the move" philosophy. I missed some of them, too, and was glad to see that they were all seen as important. The main players are here as well --- the dead are out and in force because food is probably harder to get a hold of and they really mean something. They look purty as well and that was equally important --- without some sexy undead, where would the world be?. On the downside, the story is somewhat weak, the dress of the people does not make me think "one bite means I'm dead!," and the bird portion of the movie is - well, if you watch it you'll know what I mean. I also saw a piece of the movie that was taken from Day of the Dead and wondered if this was incidental, but also had to ask myself if Umbrella might think this way.<br />Following all the games and the movies, I would have to answers with a resounding "yes."<br /><br />If you liked the other movies, then you might like this one. Just remember that the focus is Alice, that the quality is lower in some ways, that you will lose some people you like, and that this is a videogame franchise. If you can deal with all of that and still say, "it sounds good," then you have plaything. I liked the movie BUT I like a lot of stuff so this isn't the focus. The focus is zombies, sexy little zombies and the T-virus that made them, and that makes me feel HaPPY inside. If it makes you feel, too, then perhaps we could get together and sing Imagine with an undead John Lennon.<br />Or not.</p></body></html>

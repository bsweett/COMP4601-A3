It's certainly long enough, although with a film of this epic grandeur it probably could have used some more battle time.  The weakness in this film falls in the hands of lead actor Leonardo DiCaprio who fails miserably to command his role.  He lets Daniel Day-Lewis run away with the entire show, and run he does.  As Bill `The Butcher' Cutting, Day-Lewis is at his most charismatic and impressive, chewing up every ounce of scenery at his disposal, and at an almost three-hour running rate he has quite a bit of time at hand.<br /><br />The film takes place in 1863 and revolves around Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio) as he strives to avenge his father's death at the hands of Bill Cutting.  Leo never quite develops his character fully and leaves the viewer a bit tired of seeing him.  The plot drags out a bit too much and I found myself growing bored unless I was watching Day-Lewis chew, chew and chew some more.  Cameron Diaz does well but the film has little use for her and it shows except for one scene involving a knife throwing scene with Daniel where their chemistry is bright and she makes good for herself.<br /><br />This isn't, as I mentioned, a great movie but it's a decent one that has its share of good moments, most of which include the aforementioned Daniel Day-Lewis.  This film also sports a rich cast of supporting players like John C. Reilly (just love him) and Jim Broadbent and of course is rich and beautifully shot by none other than acclaimed director Martin Scorsese who proves once again why he's so well loved.  It's not a movie you'll hate, but you may end up scratching your head as to how it received 10 Oscar nominations, most shocking being that Best Picture nod that could have gone elsewhere.</p></body></html>

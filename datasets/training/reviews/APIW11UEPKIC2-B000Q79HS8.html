<meta name="summary" content="New style of film making"></head><body><p>Other people have commented on how the editing cuts so fast in this movie.  I loved it.  You always know what is going on on everyones faces right after something is said.  It is a very frenetic style.<br /><br />Supremacy picks up where Identity left off.  Having not read the books, I can't compare it.  I can compare it to other movies at this time though and tell you that this and Bourne Identity are far superior to most.  The story is very complex and we have all types of backstabbings going on(literally).  I was taken in by the whole movie.  As a whole I can't consider it as good as Bourne Identity, but the finale has to be one of the best endings to a movie I haev ever seen.<br /><br />DVD extras include a bunch of featurettes including making of and interviews.  Karl Urban gets to further explain his character.  There is also a director's commentary.</p></body></html>

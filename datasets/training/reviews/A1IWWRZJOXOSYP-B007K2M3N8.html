<meta name="summary" content="The Unwritten Star"></head><body><p>"Beyond the Sea" is a good film with some great music and great performances.  Lewis Colick's screenplay experiments with Darin making a movie about Darin, thus we have a frame within a frame, and the young Bobby Darin played by newcomer William Ullrich interfacing with the mature Darin played by Kevin Spacey.  Colick's credits as a screenwriter include the excellent "October Sky" (1999), "Along Came A Spider" with Morgan Freeman & "Domestic Disturbance" with John Travolta (2001) as well as "Ladder 49" again with John Travolta (2004).  Perhaps the screenplay is a bit too clever and a more straightforward telling of Darin's story would have reached a broader audience.  But with Kevin Spacey as director & star, this film works most of the time.  Of course, the unwritten star is Bobby Darin himself whose music and performances made him a legend.  Finding out more about his life simply deepens my appreciation for his marvelous music.<br /><br />The cast is fantastic.  No, Kevin Spacey is not going to make anyone forget Darin's voice, but he does an excellent job selling the songs in the numerous numbers in the film.  William Ullrich as the younger Darin has an equal amount of sass & swagger and was recognized as "Best Young Actor" by the Broadcast Critics Association.  Brenda Blethyn as his mother/grandmother Polly is one of the busiest actors with 5 films this year ("On A Clear Day," "Clubland," "Pride & Prejudice," "Piccadilly Jim," & the animated "Pooh's Heffalump Movie").  Twice nominated for an Oscar in "Secrets & Lies" (96) & "Little Voice" (98), she brings depth, compassion and gives the young Darin the dream & grit to overcome his health problems and find salvation through music.  As Charlie, Bob Hoskins adds a bustling energy.  Caroline Aaron who plays sister Nina does a great and boisterous job.  She's one of those actresses who works a lot, yet you struggle to place: "Working Girl" (88), "Sleepless in Seattle" (93), "Primary Colors" (98).  As the manager Steve Blauner, John Goodman turns in solid support as part of Darin's team.  Greta Scacchi who first came to U.S. movies in 1990 with Harrison Ford in "Presumed Innocent," plays Sandra Dee's mama with great bravado.  Kate Bosworth who played girlfriend to Val Kilmer's John Holmes in "Wonderland" & as a surfer in "Blue Crush" may or may not fit Dee.  But she has a perky presence and gives a varied performance as a lush, devoted wife, and glamorous movie star.<br /><br />I've got to give a special recognition to Peter Cincotti because I'm SUCH a fan of his jazz CDs.  As an actor here, he plays Dick Behrke who Darin calls "Richie," plays piano and is Darin's arranger in the film.  While not a very deep role, he's such a great musician in his own right that it was a thrill for me to see him!<br /><br />Overall, this is a good film with great music about a master musician whose story needed to be told.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

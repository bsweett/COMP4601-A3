In the latter occupation Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) does it so well even if he doesn't particularly like it or dislike it for that matter. To maintain some sense of sanity Ryan engages in casual affairs or keeps a log of his frequent flier miles and takes pride in the comps he's accumulated.  With the current economic climate things couldn't be better for Ryan's field.  Ryan, however, is at a mid-career crisis.  The home office in Omaha wants to keep him off the road by doing internet hook-up firings.  At home in Wisconsin he's reminded of the disconnect with his own roots and family.  At this crossroad Ryan has some serious choices to make.  I found "Up in the Air" to be a piece with director Jason Reitman's earlier effort "Thank You For Smoking" in that Reitman challenges the audience to sympathize with a central character with an unsavory occupation.  George Clooney is excellent in suggesting the complexities of Ryan.  The real find here is Anna Kendrick as Natalie Keener, Ryan's Ivy League protogee.  Natalie could have come off as an automaton but Kendrick mines the humanity and humor of the character.  Vera Fermiga is alright but essentially her character is the standard girlfriend part.  The accolades drawn by the film seem have caused a negative reaction among some viewers.  Divorce it from the hype you will find it is an excellent film.</p></body></html>

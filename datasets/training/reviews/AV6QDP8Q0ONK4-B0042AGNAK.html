I liked the sound track which includes the fine classic rock Satanic songs of Ozzy, ZZ, and the Carpenters. Cage sells his soul to the devil, former Easy Rider Peter Fonda and becomes his bounty hunter in the form of Ghost Rider. The movie is rather boring until we get the transformation, although it tries to keep us entertained.<br /><br />The highlight for me was the interview Eva Mendes conducts with a punk girl who describes Ghost Rider. "His head was all like in flames...but he made it look good."<br />Sam Elliot ensures the picture will remain a cult classic.<br /><br />No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. I am looking forward to the sequel.</p></body></html>

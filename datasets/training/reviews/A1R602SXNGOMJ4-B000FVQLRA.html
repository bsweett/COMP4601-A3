In some ways, it's similar to Schindler's List but The Pianist follows one person as opposed to a large segment of people.  At times, it's a difficult movie to watch because of the atrocities that occured.  I found myself comparing The Pianist to Schindler's List quite a bit.  In the end though, I prefer The Pianist because it seemed more real.  It must have been awful to feel so alone in the world after being split up from your family and not knowing what will happen to you or them.<br />The movie is about a man, Wladyslaw Szpilman who, in the 1930s, was known as the most accomplished piano player in all of Poland.  At the outbreak of the Second World War, Szpilman becomes subject to the anti-Jewish laws imposed by the Germans. By the start of the 1940s, Szpilman sees his world go from piano concert halls to the Jewish Ghetto of Warsaw and then must suffer the tragedy of his family deported to a death camp, while Szpilman is conscripted into a forced German Labor Compound. At last deciding to escape, Szpilman goes into hiding as a Jewish refugee where he is witness to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Warsaw City Revolt in 1945.  This is truly a movie that must be seen.</p></body></html>

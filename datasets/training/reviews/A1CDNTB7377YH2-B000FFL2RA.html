<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Clash of Egos"></head><body><p>This movie was a lot better than Alexander and just about as good as Gladiator (Rome seems to be more sexy than tales of the middle-east).  During the time of the crusades where Christian hordes from France decided to kill all non-Christians in the middle-east because "they were told by g-d," Orlando Bloom flees after he has murdered a priest.  He ends up in the desert and running out of water and happens on an oasis and a horse.  Two Arabs challenge him for the horse which they state is theirs.  Bloom kills one and lets the other one live because he needs him to show him how to get to Jerusalem.  It will turn out later that the man that he spares is the son of the Arab king and each man will continue to do favors for the other throughout the movie.<br /><br />Bloom ends up in Jerusalem and catches the eye of the "married" sister of the local king.  She eventually starts to sneak off to see him.  Her brother the king, does not have long to live because he has leprosy and the woman's husband will become the new king through her when she dies.<br /><br />The rest of the movie involves clashes of egos between the new king, Bloom, the Church leader and everyone else and it appears that egos totally blind men even if it will cause their death.<br /><br />There are some excellent battle/siege at the castle scenes as good as Troy, Arthur, Lord of the Rings and all the other movies of that genre.<br /><br />Bloom makes and excellent hero and he seems to make the impossible happen.  I really liked this movie.</p></body></html>

Directed by Robert DeNiro (who also has a role in the film as a general who played a key part in creating the CIA), this film shows us a rare glimpse into the world of spies and counter-spies, paranoia, and secrecy that surrounds the cult of intelligence.  Much of the film is indeed an accurate portrayal of the history of said agency and its role in America's foreign policy decision making throughout much of the Twentieth Century.  The film follows the career of Edward Wilson (played by Matt Damon) from his early years as a poetry student at Yale University, periodically spying on his professors who allegedly were linked to Nazi-sympathetic organizations, to his role in the development of the Allied intelligence community during World War II, to the creation of the CIA and the birth of the Cold War and beyond.  The film is one of epic proportions (some have compared it to other classics such as _The Godfather_) and is essential viewing for all thinking people.  In the world of undercover operations, no one is to be trusted.  Whether or not a certain individual is in fact working for Allied intelligence, the Nazis, or later the Soviets simply cannot be determined, and we witness this world develop as the sense of trust breaks down and paranoia ensues.  The movie travels back and forth between the events that gave rise to the Bay of Pigs fiasco (also hinting at the later Kennedy assassination - believed by some conspiracy theorists to have been the work of the CIA) and the earlier career of Wilson.  At Yale University, Wilson joins up with the class of upper crust WASPs (the "Old Americans") and takes part in their adolescent rituals as part of the ultra-secretive Skull and Bones fraternity.  (Many of our political leaders have arisen from this fraternity and some have conjectured that they are responsible for wielding the true power in the world.  The movie even hints at the idea that they may have been responsible for "Soviet power" as well, as the true puppet masters behind world events.)  Wilson falls in love with a deaf girl (he has a certain "weakness" for deaf girls as we are to see later in the movie); however, a brief affair of his with an upper class girl leads to an unplanned pregnancy and thus forces him to marry.  (However, it should be pointed out that one gets the impression that the "elites" are manipulating the whole thing from behind the scenes anyway, because throughout the movie never once is definitive proof provided that the child is even his.  Furthermore, he is to go away for a long time to aid the Allied war effort and thus is not even there to see his newborn son.)  From his early days of spying on university professors (or are they really?), Wilson becomes more and more involved in the intelligence community.  This leads him to serve on the side of the Allies during World War II.  Following World War II, the Allied leaders make a trade of Nazi scientists for Jewish scientists, and thus begins the Cold War as the Soviet power and America and Britain contend for control of the world.  Eventually a series of events will force Wilson to make the ultimate sacrifice - one of many in his desire to further the aims of American imperialism and consolidate the power of the CIA.  The movie also shows and hints at such historical realities as the presence of homosexuals in the intelligence community (and the fact of their homosexuality being used to blackmail them - the rites of the Skull and Bones fraternity could also be described as vaguely homoerotic for that matter!) and the CIA's experiments with drugs (in particular LSD).  There are some rather chilling lines and uncanny prophecies in this movie which haunted me for days following my viewing of it.  At one point Robert DeNiro's character remarks that it was the "clerks and civil servants" who gave Hitler his power, and thus it will be necessary to somehow limit the CIA's power because otherwise it runs the risk of creating a totalitarian surveillance state.  Secondly, at one point in the movie Matt Damon's character (Wilson) is asked by Joe Pesci (playing an Italian mobster) what "his people" (presumably the upper crust WASPs) have, mentioning that the Italians have the church, Jews have their tradition, and blacks have their music.  To this, Damon replies that they have the United States of America and that the rest are just visitors here.  At another point, it is said that the people from the CIA never put a "the" in front of CIA.  When asked why, they reply that putting a "the" in front of CIA would be like putting a "the" in front of God.  (Angelina Jolie's character remarks on several occassions that during the dinners of the Skull and Bones fraternity they first account for all members of the Bonesmen and then invoke God.  As she puts it, "Agency first, God second.")  These are some of the chilling lines from the movie.  Ultimately the movie raises some very disturbing questions about the nature of government.  As America heads further and further towards a surveillance state (brought further in that direction with each impending war), it becomes necessary to examine where we have come from.  As is asked in the movie, do the elite controllers who make and break world events try to keep war to a minimum, or do they merely use war to further their own agendas and consolidate their power?  Certainly a scary question to ponder.  I feel that this movie offers much to think about (and ultimately is very frightening!), but so long as the tough questions remain unasked and people remain asleep at the wheel, it will be that much easier for those in power to slide us off into totalitarianism.  Finally, I should say that I find it odd that this movie (which not only offers much food for thought but is genuinely very well put together) has gathered such low reviews.  Perhaps it is just a further indication of the fact that the public does not like to think and ask questions and this is scary in and of itself.</p></body></html>

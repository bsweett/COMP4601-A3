<meta name="summary" content="The Shining: A Great Kubrick Horror Film"></head><body><p>Stanley Kubrick does horror.  The Shining is more of a Kubrick film than a horror film but that's no complaint.  Jack Nicholson is an unbalanced writer who plans to spend a winter as a caretaker of a Colorado hotel that will be closed off from the outside world.  Scenes of impending doom and a haunted house fill out the rest of the story with a mention of the title.  The Shining is a form of telepathy that the little boy has to communicate with another world.  Shelly Duvall makes a great mom and is a wonderful actress.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DARKLY DISTURBING"></head><body><p>I haven't seen the original Swedish film on which this English version is based, so my review is based purely on David Fincher's movie.<br />The movie is beautifully photographed, its snowy setting underscoring the chilling storyline.  Its intricate plot demands close attention, as does its deliberate, slow-paced first half.  The second half picks up once the titular character joins forces with the journalist to track down an elusive serial killer.  Rooney Mara shoots to stardom as the unconventional leading lady--a multi-pierced, tattooed, antisociable computer hacker--a role that garnered her a Best Actress Oscar nod.  Mara certainly dominates the film in her edgy, complex performance.  Daniel Craig is a competent, if unexciting, actor who suffers the James Bond curse---its hard to separate his 007 persona from his other roles.  I found it hard to be impressed with this performance as I did in his recent films like DREAM HOUSE and COWBOYS AND ALIENS.  Oscar winner Christopher Plummer, the always imposing Stellan Skarsgardm and the elegant Joely Richardson round out the supporting cast.  Yorick van Wanginingen as Mara's repulsive money manager is especially convincing.  The rape scenes are some of the most disturbing in recent cinema.<br />GIRL is definitely a commendable film, but its also quite revolting in its ugly storyline.  It's not easy to watch at times.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="this movie is action-packed from beginning to end."></head><body><p>I really enjoyed Terminator 4 aka Terminator Salvation, and I hope that if Terminator 5 comes out, it has all the future scenes from Terminator, T2, and T3. This was a radical movie. I got to see new forms of robots that Skynet created. I thought that this movie was a nice departure from bad cyborg-good cyborg fights. it was cool to see Roland Kickinger with a CGI of Arnold's face, as Arnold played a T-800 in all 3 Terminator movies. it was freaky how the cyborg gun turret recognized Marcus Wright, but did not shoot at him, because it knew that he was a Terminator cyborg. it didn't matter to me that Arnold was not in this movie, because I got a good thrill out of it none the less.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Allegory On Two Levels"></head><body><p>Hollywood has a long history of recording how the world may come to a spectacular end.  Most of these films are long on special effects but short on human interest. In THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, director Roland Emmerich continues this tradition with Dennis Quaid as a climatologist who correctly predicts the onset of a world crunching ice age.  Much of the attendant controversy of this film is spun by comparisons with the nonfiction doomsday thriller book, THE COMING GLOBAL SUPERSTORM by Art Bell, that suggests that global warming would melt the ice caps and the resulting intrusion of massive amounts of fresh water into the salty oceans would deflect the equatorial air and water flow that warms the western hemisphere.  DAT is also a thinly veiled political allegory that suggests that the Republican refusal to accord with the Kyoto Protocols to reduce global warming is the primary reason for the cataclysm.  The actor who plays the movie vice president is a dead ringer for Dick Cheney, who later sees third world countries like Mexico as the savior of what remains of America.  <p>On a technical note, the hard science of DAT falls short of credibility since basic meteorological principles render it most unlikely that the Northern Hemisphere could be subject to a deep freeze in the time scale depicted.  Still, other end-of-the-world-films like THE DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE (1961) offer superior scripts and acting to involve the audience even if the special effects were shoddy by today's standards.  In DAT, the special effects range from convincing, computer-enhanced tornadoes wrecking Los Angeles, a tidal wave inundating Manhattan, and bowling ball hailstones pelting Tokyo.  The human element revolves around Quaid hiking to Manhattan to find his son who is holed up in the New York Public Library.  Director Emmerich did not hesitate to lift entire scenes and characters from an earlier film ICE AGE (1998), which dealt with similar themes: a president who is the last to leave the White House, a book lover arguing whether Dante's Inferno ought to be used for fuel, the hero risking death to find his family.  What emerges from the frozen muck of THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is a film that is surprisingly fun and involving.  The viewer may not be convinced that we are headed for a real life Big Freeze, but that viewer almost certainly had the visual ride of his life.</p></body></html>

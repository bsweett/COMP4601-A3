While LAND OF THE DEAD is not as classic as this beauty, all four of Romero's 'DEAD' films hold true to the zombie genre. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was the film that truly changed the horror genre, and Romero knew he had it made when he graced the movie audience with sheer terror.<br /><br />While revolutionary, this film also features some B-grade acting (Duane Jones as the lead hero, really was much better than most actors of this genre's heyday) and shocking gore effects that are quite gruesome. The color version of this film doesn't change anything at all, and really the black and white version is more terrifying because it's darker, and it creates more menace. The zombies are relentless; the characters are cornered like frightened dogs; and the gore is not short of supply. People are trapped in an abandoned home trying to find a way to keep the undead out, but the zombies are relentless and will stop at nothing to feast on warm human flesh. The movie's black & white documentary style innovation is key to the effective suspense and terror that ultimately breathes in this movie.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD today is still heralded as one of the classic horror films of all time, and it's sequels are almost as powerful, but none of them will come close to the sheer terror and power of this one.<br /><br />Romero's legacy will live on for years to come, and all the 'DEAD' films will hold a place in the ultimate shrine of the horror genre. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is a must-own film, a testament to the power that we, the cult following, gave to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.</p></body></html>

You know the scenario, the vast majority of mankind has been wiped-out almost overnight, now only small pockets of communities remain, each location having little to know knowledge as to where the others might be. Law and order have become a thing of the past, now control belongs in the hands of the strongest and of course the most evil of the survivors.<br /><br />In this "only the strong survive" world comes the man in dark sunglasses, Denzel Washington who possesses a book more valuable than gold. When evil guy Gary Oldman learns of the book he sends his minions after it and the battle begins.<br /><br />Again, nothing new here, a little 'Mad Max' and 'Waterworld' along with an added secret ala 'The Sixth Sense' that serves as an interesting twist at the end but not enough to make you want to watch the movie again and look for the clues you missed the first time through. However if you're a Denzel or Oldman fan it's worth at least one viewing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fluffy, but Still Worth "Catch"-ing"></head><body><p>Like 1999's "The Talented Mr. Ripley," Steven Speilberg's breezy "Catch Me If You Can" tells the story of a young man who enjoys life's riches through an identity that's not his own.  Leo DiCaprio is Frank Abagnale, Jr., a teenager who spends the mid-1960s posing as an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer--all the while cashing checks around the world that ring to the tune of $2.5 million.  His quick wit and suave demeanor are apparently enough to make unsuspecting strangers believe at face value anything Frank says.  Hot on his tail, however, is an FBI agent (Tom Hanks, in a supporting role) who's determined to nail Frank and end his streak of ruthless deception.  DiCaprio fits into his role like a pair of well-worn jeans and seems more confortable with his material than he did in Scorcese's "Gangs of New York."  Productionwise, "Catch Me If You Can" is also a success, as it captures the flavor and texture of the 1960s admirably through its colors and fashions.  I just wished the film would dig a little deeper into Frank's background which could shed some light as to why he decided to be a juvenile con man.  Sure, we know Frank's parents divorced (Christopher Walken, who plays Frank's dad, earned his Oscar nomination, by the way), but not all kids with mommy/daddy issues turn into sophisticated criminals.  And, at 2 hours and 20 minutes, "Catch Me If You Can" gets a bit long-winded and could use some trimming.  To be honest, this movie doesn't represent the cream of Speilberg's crop, and it pales a bit in comparison to the far more engaging "Minority Report," also released in 2002.  As for the DVD itself, I don't understand why it needed to have 2 discs.  The movie and the bonus material (which consists mostly of glossy featurettes) could have fit into one DVD.  Despite this, the film's lighthearted spirit and agreeable tone make it still worth "catch"-ing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interesting but predictable at the same time"></head><body><p>Nice set-up about an interpreter in the UN overhearing African<br />coup attempt and inclusion of awareness about genocide, but a fairly predictable script.  Some intelligent moments and twists,<br />but also a fairly predictable parallel relation between Kidman<br />and Penn, and a bit too many sad eyed scenes.  The audience<br />could guess a lot of what is to happen, and Penn's opening scene where he drops his wedding band into an empty booze glass<br />is nice symbolism, but really gives away easily everything about this character.  Ending a bit melodramatic.  Take a pass unless you're bored.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Why should you see the Incredibles?"></head><body><p>The Incredibles tells a terrific story, which follows the lives of fallen hero's always itching to get back in the action.<br /><br />I went in to the theatre expecting a few laughs, but also carried in a little grain of salt. It would be so easy for Pixar and Disney to take a mis-step and release a quick money grabbing kid charmer, but fortunately my mind was quickly set to ease. The action, the imagination, and the downright quirkiness of the incredibles makes it a near perfect, ambitious flick.<br /><br />The animators must have been going nuts through production. The details are astounding, and even with all their strength's the hero's retain a sincere, flawed humanity. Any other way, and it would have lost my vote.<br /><br />See the Incredibles, it's original, that in itself is a virtue.</p></body></html>

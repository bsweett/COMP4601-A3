<meta name="summary" content="A Great Movie Of A Legendary Musician's Life And Career.."></head><body><p>The late night movie for yesterday was "Ray," the story of Ray Charles. I found it in my DVD shelves and I must have had it for a while. My wife and I (about 6 years ago) used to buy used (pre-viewed) discs from Blockbuster Stores. Remember them? Well, this one has a sticker and shows the price as 14.99 for a used disc! Hard to believe.<br /><br />In any case, it's a very good movie and I watched the version that was shown in theaters. Perhaps some day I'll also watch the extended version and the rest of the extra material that comes with the movie. There's two packed discs. The movie follows the life and career of Ray Charles from childhood to death. One is the story of his childhood which runs from his birth up to about when he becomes an entertainer. The other story is of his history as an entertainer. The two stories are overlapped such that the viewer will switch back and forth. It's a little unusual, but works rather well.<br /><br />I had a major part of my personal musical development in the span from about 1952 to 1959. It was the time of the birth of Rock and Roll and I just loved it! R & R was not a genre as yet during those early days and it was kinda a loose collection of things that didn't fit too well anywhere else. There were elements of gospel, country, rhythm and blues, pop, jazz and novelty tunes all bunched together. If it was somewhat brash, had a strong beat and was offensive to the common populace, it was called Rock and Roll and played only in limited places and on limited radio stations. You had to be a R & R fan to keep track of  what was going on. But it was worth it.<br /><br />Ray Charles fit into this early R & R grouping and he became renowned for his wonderful songs such as "Baby, What I'd Say" and "Hit The Road Jack" and many others. It was a wonderful period and living it helps a lot. I liked Charles 50s music best. When he drifted into country and pop and had difficulties with drugs and his record company, my interest fell off and I was enjoying other artists.<br /><br />I enjoyed the early part of the movie the most, the part that covered the fifties. When it went into the change of record companies and change in style to country, and all the marital and drug problems, my interest in the movie fell off, just as my interest in his music had done decades earlier. However, it's an essential part of the movie and well worth viewing if you want the whole story of Ray Charles.<br /><br />In any case, it was an excellent movie. Very well done. And the music is wonderful. Surely this one must have picked up a bundle of awards and other accolades. It's one of those kinds of movies, without question.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

Unfortunately, this promise is squandered and the film swiftly finds itself descending into the usual tedious Bruckheimeresque tropes of big explosions, cars flipping over, the plentiful and largely unconvincing use of CGI, and a complete lack of subtlety.<br /><br />The casting is also a problematic, as let's face it, Keanu Reeves couldn't act his way out of a paper bag at the best of times, Jennifer Connelly retreads her performance from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKC3">Hulk (Widescreen 2-Disc Special Edition)</a>, Jaden Smith is merely irritating and John Cleese looks wildly out of place. Whilst it was a pleasure seeing veteran actor James Hong turn up in a small cameo role, his presence, as an elderly diner in a fast-food restaurant who is more than he seems, only serves to deflate the mystique surrounding Klaatu and his intentions - but this is no fault of Hong's, who is splendid as usual.<br /><br />The real problem with this film is not the lack of imagination, but the sense that the crew didn't have the courage of their convictions in re-imagining the central concept. An extra on the DVD exemplifies this when its explained that in pre-production, the crew went through multitudinous re-imaginings of Gort - many of which were far more interesting and totemic than the final model used - only to go with the safe bet and plant the original robot's head on top of an athlete's body for the final film.<br /><br />One to catch on TV. Its not terrible, its not brilliant, its not really anything...</p></body></html>

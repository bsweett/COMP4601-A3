<meta name="summary" content=""Demons stay in hell, huh? Tell them that.""></head><body><p>Constantine was a very pleasant surprise. All the warning flags were up: a much-changed Alan Moore comic book premise (shifted from the UK to LA), a music video director and Keanu Reeves reunited with his dire Chain Reaction co-star Rachel Weisz. Luckily the changes take, the director actually knows how to tell a story and play a scene and Rachel Weisz has learned to act a little in the intervening years. It's damned hero (even Tilda Swinton's rather wonderful Archangel Gabriel tells him "You're f****d.") trying to buy his way into heaven by `deporting' demons is worthy of a franchise of his own, and the film is far more imaginative and entertaining than you'd expect. It's just surprising that, with lines like "God's just a kid with an ant farm," the fundies didn't firebomb the theatres that played it.</p></body></html>

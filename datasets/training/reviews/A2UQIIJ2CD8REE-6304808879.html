<meta name="summary" content="More gory than scary, but still a great film!"></head><body><p>When Larry Cotton moves with his 2nd wife, Julia, into his family's abandoned, old house in London, they accidentally and unknowingly awaken Larry's evil, dead brother, Frank, who requires blood sacrifices to make his body whole again. Julia happens to be madly in love with Frank, with whom she had previously had an affair, so she takes on the role of provider for Frank's blood needs. Gradually, he becomes more whole, as Julia lures men to the home and murders them in the attic where Frank hides. Complications are more than just the risk of getting caught for murder, though, as Frank is being pursued by sadomasochistic, other-dimensional beings called Cenobites that desire to take him back to their realm and torture him forever. Larry's attractive, young daughter, Kirsty, becomes mixed up in the whole thing too when she discovers the skinless Frank, escapes him, and unleashes the Cenobites via a mysterious puzzle box that opens a doorway to their world. She attempts to make a deal with the Cenobites to save herself, but they are no to be trusted at all.<br /><br />Clive Barker's "Hellraiser" is no doubt one of the big 1980's horror classics. And, I have to admit, being a film buff with horror being one of my top genre preferences, I shamefully still haven't seen a lot of the big classics. This is one of those I had put off for far too long. Luckily, one of my good friends frequently introduces me to such films. So, I've finally gotten to see Hellraiser in this 20th Anniversary Edition DVD release from Anchor Bay. My overall feelings? This is a really good horror film. It's not something that's likely to scare you or make you jump, but it has cool, creepy, disturbing concepts, and if you are a gore fan (I'm not, but as long as the movie is good anyway...) it is sure to please in that area too. Not something to watch while you're having dinner (I won't do that again), but definitely worth viewing if you have never seen it before. I particularly am fascinated with the concept of parallel dimensions and their inhabitants these days, so something like this is extra fascinating and creepy to me because of that. The whole exploration of the concepts of hell and heaven and the afterlife, and possible alternative explanations incorporating multi-dimensional theory, really enthrall me. Though it is pure sci-fi/horror, this film has a lot more to offer than cheap thrills. I do recommend checking it out. It won't become one of my favorite horror films (though it does have a cute female lead, which I always appreciate), as I tend to prefer a higher "fun factor", adds to the rewatchability too, but it is still worthy of being a genre classic.<br /><br />As for the 20th Anniversary DVD (and, yes, this film IS on Blu-Ray already, but I can't say what is or is not included in that release), this one holds multiple behind the scenes interviews, a commentary with Clive Barker and star Ashley Laurence, multiple trailers, galleries, and some DVD ROM features. Pretty satisfying. There have been a great many sequels to the film, too, which I now have ahead of me to explore, but I get the impression from what I hear that this is the only essential one. I'm still curious to see them though; the ones with Ashley Laurence at the very least.</p></body></html>

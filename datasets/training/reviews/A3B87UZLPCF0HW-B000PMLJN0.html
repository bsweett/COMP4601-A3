<meta name="summary" content="The Saw series rock-I don't quite know what this is--waste of theater air??"></head><body><p>Dead Silence is a creaky gothic horror by the writers who introduced us to the dubious pleasures of the Saw franchise. James Wan and Leigh Whannell use those potent props the ventriloquist's puppet and an old nursery rhyme to piece together a gruesome tale of supernatural revenge. (How stupid..) Unfortunately the cast are so supernaturally dim that it's impossible to care about any of them.<br />This is admirably surreal stuff. And the sensual pleasure in watching this kind of horror movie depends entirely on your tolerance for ear-splitting jolts of shock. In the end, though, I wanted my money back.<br />BILLY WAS THE BEST ACTOR--THAT SAYS A LOT SINCE HE IS A FREAKING DOLL..</p></body></html>

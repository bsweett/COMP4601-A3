<meta name="summary" content="VERY IMAGINATIVE, SURREAL HUMAN FANTASY, BUT.."></head><body><p>Let's get the praise over with first. <p>This unconventional movie starts with a very intriguing notion, brilliantly surreal and off-centre, basically something very different from mainstream cinema but still playful and fun. It rakes up some thoughtful issues -- <p>(1) The real sexual desires buried deep in human minds;<br />(2) The need of ordinary folk to want to be someone else, someone more *seemingly* glamorous than themselves;<br />(3) The expressiveness of the puppeting medium; some of the puppeteer sequences are simply breathtaking;<br />(4) The swiftness with which people would pounce on the weakness of other humans to start making money;<br />(5) In parts, the jerk-a-tear statement about animal bondage;<br />(6) And tying in all these loose sub-ends, the ultimate notion of freedom and love of self, etc etc. <p>All that is well and dandy, and this is easily one of the most creative movies out of Hollywood in recent times. <p>However, having just watched it a second time I must say it's a bit of an empty shell once you get beyond the surprise factor. I didn't laugh, I smirked the odd time, and certainly my heart wasn't warmed - it's a very cold movie really, nothing wrong with that, but it's hardly one that will merit lasting affection.<p>It's a strange mixture really, because there is some sort of pretension to art at times, yet at others the characters and the emotions are paper-thin. Yet we're supposed somehow to be affected by these characters despite the fact that the film mocks and satirises them at every opportunity - the difference between this and the Coens is that they love even their most repellent characters and it rubs off on you!<p>In the end my reaction to this is the same as to the Naked Gun or one of those broad hit-and-miss comedies - it's the same schtick. Towards the fourth quarter of the movie, I was just hoping it could all be put to an end soon. <p>The director's interview on the DVD is funnier in two minutes than the rest of the film put together.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I just did not like this one as much as I did Vol. 1"></head><body><p>I'm afraid I'm going to have to go against the party line regarding KILL BILL VOL. 2: I simply wasn't as satisfied with this conclusion as I was with VOL. 1. If writer-director Quentin Tarantino has one fault as an otherwise truly tremendous filmmaker, it is that, in his immense enthusiasm for his art, he has a tendency to meander, or just to sprawl in general. He is so in love with a particular scene or group of scenes that he can't bear to cut it from the film even though it serves no obvious purpose to the film. The result is that the scenes slow the film's pace down (considerably, in the case of this movie). You had the silly scene in PULP FICTION (an otherwise awesome movie) in which Christopher Walken spent about five minutes speechifying about the history of a gold watch he hid up his ass during Vietnam, and now you have the long section involving Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) in this film. Sure, it's an interesting set of training scenes, with both Liu and Thurman pulling off some nice moves, and Liu makes the most of his juicy part---but did we really have to spend about ten whole minutes exploring this flashback just so we could understand how The Bride (Uma Thurman) could get out of a particularly sticky situation?<br /><br />But if overlength wasn't bad enough with this film, Quentin Tarantino seems to have altogether abandoned his usual quick-witted, fresh way with dialogue and paced some of the dialogue-heavy scenes---especially the final scenes with Bill (David Carradine) and our heroine verbally facing off---in a such a debilitatingly portentous manner that it literally sucked all the life and wit out of the dialogue. Frankly, I got bored after a while listening to these people talk so SLOOOOOWLY and with so many pauses in between each sentence. What happened here, QT? If this is your attempt at creating "atmosphere," then...well, perhaps you've been watching too many movies. (I suppose the overly portentous dialogue style was also present in VOL. 1, but the sheer energy level was too high to notice.)<br /><br />That is not to discount the many good things about this movie. Tarantino is still much the flashy technical innovator in this film, and he uses almost everything from B&W to the old classic 4x3 frame in this movie. The action scenes are once again dizzyingly, dazzlingly executed, with a particularly memorable fight between The Bride and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) that climaxes with a real doozy. And look, I don't have a problem with this movie trying to be different and more character-driven than the more physically brilliant VOL. 1. It certainly helps that Tarantino still maintains his good touch with actors; his characterizations allow Thurman especially to shine in this movie, and she comes through with a weight of emotion that is startling and occasionally moving. And, of course, David Carradine is a revelation in this movie---as was John Travolta and Robert Forster in PULP FICTION and JACKIE BROWN, respectively---skillfully and charismatically playing a bad guy who turns out not to be as purely despicable as he seems.<br /><br />It's too bad Tarantino had to be so heavy-handed with the dialogue scenes, so much so that he nearly drowns the actors' performances and muffles the considerable wit of his own dialogue. Some might find the dialogue passages of the movie "hypnotic." Unfortunately, I found the lot of them "interminable" the way they were directed and paced, and thus I must say that VOL. 2 is a fairly steep dropoff from the highs of VOL. 1. Overall I simply can't call KILL BILL VOL. 2 one of Quentin Tarantino's best films.</p></body></html>

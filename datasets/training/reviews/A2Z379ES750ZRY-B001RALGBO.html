<meta name="summary" content="Great special effects makes up for mediocre movie."></head><body><p>There is nothing specific about this movie that is particularly bad.  The story line okay.  The acting is not necessarily Oscar material, but nonetheless is fair.  The special effects of the flooding and freezing of New York City is pretty spectacular.<br /><br />My only quibble in terms of belivability is that in spite of cold temperatures there is no breath visible -- which given the amount of money that was spent on the special effects is an unacceptable oversight -- could have easily been done with digital post processing.</p></body></html>

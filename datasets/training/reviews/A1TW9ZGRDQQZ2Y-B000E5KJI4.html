<meta name="summary" content="Not Up to Par With Gladiator, but Way Above Alexander."></head><body><p>This was an entertaining film that almost discounts Homer's Iliad entirely. I watched the film as a seperate version of a similar story and I enjoyed it. Brad Pitt is a good enough actor and is physically a good choice for Achilles, but his acting isn't enough when compared to the great work from Eric Bana as Hector or Peter O'tToole as King Priam. Orlando Bloom as Paris and the girl who played Helen were a joke and the lame dialogue they were given didn't help in the least. I wouldn't put this film in the same breath as Braveheart, Gladiator, or even The Last of the Mohicans in terms of great epic films, but after seeing the travesty that was Alexander I now appreciate this film as just pure entertainment. I gave it 5 stars instead of 4 to balance out some of the harsh reviews listed below.</p></body></html>

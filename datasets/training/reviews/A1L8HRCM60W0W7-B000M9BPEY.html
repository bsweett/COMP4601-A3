<meta name="summary" content="A HEART-WARMING TREAT OF MAGICAL SPLENDOUR"></head><body><p>A delightful diversion from regular films! The screen frequently pops with whimsical exaggerations and candy-tinted flourishes in this imaginative adaptation of Wallace's novel. <p>Plus, we have a liberal dollop of humourous banter, dealing with an evocative theme that most of us could relate to. Unlike the big narrative arc that is typical of most movies, we get a collection of woolly, offbeat short stories featuring the same pivotal character. Which is great. <p>On the potential negative side, if you don't like fantasia, be warned: there are oodles of make-believe tricks and tropes, and by the time we drag to the supposedly reconciliatory finale, the deck is so stacked against reality that one needs a jug of cappucino to continue caring. <p>Not to mention that there are at least three British artists in the lead attempting a Southern drawl (with mixed results) in their accents. <p>Regardless, what's not to savour in a well-made movie with no problems that a better judgment in editing wouldn't have solved! <p>Recommended rental.</p></body></html>

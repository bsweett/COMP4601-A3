<meta name="summary" content="A Stinky Try at Cinehistory"></head><body><p>I really wanted to like this movie, and parts of it are OK.<br /><br />As soon as this film begins, when I see the ritual of the Breaking of the Pope's Ring (which tradition the Church abandoned generations ago)...when I see the ring has the deceased pope's name as "PIUS XVI"...well, I was snickering, and it galloped off from there. We never quit snickering.<br /><br />The last real Pius was Pius XII, so I see Dan Brown exhibited his usual stupidity in this, which is his 1st terrible novel, which this is the film version of! Did he conveniently forget there should be Piuses XIII-XV first? By the bye, there is fiction and then there's sheer boneheadedness, and Brown is the poster child for victims of the latter.<br /><br />Also, I was amazed at the lack of comments about the incerdibly stupid scene of the pope's tomb being opened to check for signs of poisoning. Not only stupid, also offensive. In the past, there was at least one film I can think of that the Church went after just for its title (THE POPE MUST DIE, 1991, changed to THE POPE MUST DIET--vid. my review of it).<br /><br />In ANGELS & DEMONS, the pope's been poisoned, they desecrate his tomb (yes, it is desecration the way they do it in the movie)...then they see with their own eyes that he appears to have been murdered. Though with magical autopsy eyes they see, because only an autopsy could prove the murder. This would have normally released howls of protest from the Vatican, and the pope would certainly have anathematized this film.<br /><br />Too bad we can't anathematize for bad cinema.<br /><br />These are but a few tiny iceberg tips in what is, admittedly, a 'sorta' rousing Dumb-ass Action film. Rather clever, the whole anti-matter-Illuminati-in-the-Church business. Also, simultaneously asinine. As was much of this picturesque film--though I thought the rooms of the Swiss Guard looked rather nice and genuine. Why does this sort of thing have to be so brainless?<br /><br />The cheap mention of the "God Particle"...give me a break.<br /><br />We noticed Hanks looking browbeaten and raggedy in this film. Very likely he didn't want to do it. I did like him changing into priest's clothes which happened (miraculously) to be hanging right next to him, right when he required them. Anti-Catholic? Hell, people, this film is anti-cinema, anti-good-taste! Still, it's never anywhere near as bad as film can get, and as I said, I do kind of like watching it.<br /><br />And you know, THE DA VINCI CODE, equally dumb as it was, I actually liked a lot more because we see Langdon for the first time. He's interesting and I liked the way his thinking processes were shown. Here we get SQUAT. Perhaps it is because this film is a sequel, and is treated as such...but it is based on Brown's 1st novel. THE DA VINCI CODE is his 2nd and I hope his LAST novel....<br /><br />Amazon sells great copies of "Shoes of the Fisherman". I suggest you get it instead. If you suffered through the film version of Brown's 2nd novel ("Dan Brown Teaches You All About Mary Magdalene", wasn't that it? :0), you deserve so much better.</p></body></html>

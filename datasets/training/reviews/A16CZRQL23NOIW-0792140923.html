Zemckis masterpiece turns around the life and times of an elemental man who lives according fundamental schemes but ignoring all the vices and prejudices, acts and shines in the universe of the double moral and accustomed pattern behavior, so typical in us.<br /><br />Indeed, the life is a chocolat box, and that ineffable premise will lead him to elevate the moral and self steem not only about him but the rest of his beloved friend along his existence.<br /><br />Drama and humor share its right place in this jeweled and admirable artistic movie that has become in a cult movie in just eleven years.<br /><br />Hnaks is simply overwhelming, and so Gary Sinise.<br /><br />Go for this inspired picture, without reserves.</p></body></html>

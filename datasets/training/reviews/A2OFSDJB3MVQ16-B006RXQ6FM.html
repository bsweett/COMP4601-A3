<meta name="summary" content="John Patrick Shanley adapts his hit play into a movie"></head><body><p>I had already seen this as a play before the film came out and the most obvious difference between them is Meryl Streep's intepretation of Sister Aloysis versus Linda Hunt or Cherry Jones' take on her on stage.  Streep seems to be more histronic and theatrical versus the restraint of the two actress--almost like she'a witch in a halloween suit!!  Nevertheless, I still found the film worthwhile despite this difference. The final confrontation between Hoffman and Streep is probably screen acting at his best!! And Viola Davis makes her brief appearance count--no wonder she was nominated!! Shanley has succeeded in raising "doubt" in this fine film.</p></body></html>

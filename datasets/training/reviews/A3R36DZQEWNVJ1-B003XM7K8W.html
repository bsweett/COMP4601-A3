<meta name="summary" content="Willis goes head on with the bad guys in Hostage"></head><body><p>Bruce Willis (Sin City, Pulp Fiction) stars in this hardcore action movie about a negotiator who has to make a choice. He has to save another family to save his own family in the process who are being held captive by corrupt FBI agents. Inside the residence of actor Kevin Pollack (The Usual Suspects, The Whole Nine and Ten Yards), his son and his daughter are being held hostage by 3 kids, 2 played by Jonathan Tucker (The Deep End) and Ben Foster (Big Trouble, Get Over It). Things happen that alter situations and forces Willis to go head on with both the corrupt agents and the punk kids inside the house. Also starring Kim Coates (Black Hawk Down, ExChange). Some people might like this movie, which in the case I did but some might find the language and the really hardcore scenes to be a little extreme.</p></body></html>

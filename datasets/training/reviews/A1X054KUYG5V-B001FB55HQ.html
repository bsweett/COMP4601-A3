<meta name="summary" content="Half-reboot, half-sequel, all-terrible"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Between the lack of attention paid to the previous films in the series, dumb storyline riddled with plotholes (why don't the machines just kill Kyle Reese when they have him in a cell?) and vacant performance by Sam Worthington, there's a ton of problems with this latest (and hopefully last) Terminator film; whether you're a fan of the original series or a neophyte, there's really no need to watch this sorry excuse for a film.<br /><br />2/4</p></body></html>

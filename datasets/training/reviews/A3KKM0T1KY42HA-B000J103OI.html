While some of the fast-paced-ness seems over the top, as a veteran that's worked in the publishing business in NYC, I can say first hand that it is not over the top...for the most part.<br /><br />And the completely obtuse disposition that defines Meryl Streep's character, while perhaps a bit exaggerated at times, is universally known in the industry as the standard by which you should set your expectations for a boss if you are going to work at any of the big firms that publish the fat fashion and beauty magazines. I'd bet that Weisberger, quite contrary to the disclaimer that "this book/movie is a work of fiction", was loosely (or not so loosely) based on a real publisher.<br /><br />Some of the dialogue and situations do indeed stretch the limits of reality, but no more than that of the humorous bits commonly found in shows like HBO's Sex and the City or Entourage. And no wonder...Director David Frankel has made his mark on both of those as a director.<br /><br />Overall, I was completely entertained. I don't know if it's the title using the word "Prada" or if it's some whisper down the line miscommunication that's incorrectly given The Devil Wears Prada the official chick-flick label among the guy community...perhaps cheating this movie out of a much higher dollar gross.<br /><br />Maybe it's a guy mentality thing? Yesterday I told my buddy about how much I enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada. I told him it's a good story; it moves quickly; you can relate to the situations; and the acting is excellent. He said, "Does Anne Hathaway get naked?" Um...no. It's just a very good movie.<br /><br />So my recommendation, guys, see it. But if you were one of the naysayers, be warned: You will need to go back to everyone and confess that you got your butt kicked by a chick-flick.</p></body></html>

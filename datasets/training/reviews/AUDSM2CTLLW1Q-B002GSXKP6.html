There is just such a smooth 'coolness' that emanates from this movie that they viewer can't help but enjoy it.  In an era where film studios and directors try to smash the audience over the head with what they think the audience should think is popular and cool, it's refreshing to see a movie that lets its 'cool' develop on its own.  Director Stephen Soderbergh to a break from such serious, award-winning movies as "Traffic" and "Erin Brockovich" to direct this film that was essentially a recreational activity with a group friends with names such as Pitt, Damon, Clooney, and Roberts.<br /><br />  The plot of "Ocean's 11" centers on a plan by con-man Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his partner-in-crime Rusty (Brad Pitt) to pull off biggest heist in Las Vegas history: the seizure of $150 million from a secure vault that services three of Vegas' biggest casinos.  This does present itself as an easy task to accomplish.  In a humorous aside, the man who will be financing this heist (played by Elliott Gould) tells Ocean and Rusty about the three most successful heist attempts in Las Vegas history.  Each one failed to make it past the security and each one incurred some major injury in the process.  These were the most SUCCESSFUL heists(!), and now Ocean is trying to break into the most secure vault this side of Fort Knox.  Obviously, in order to pull of this caper, many players will need to be involved and have to ply their respective skills in order to make this plan work.  However, beyond just the security issues, there are a couple of issues that put this plan in jeopardy.  #1: The casino vault is controlled by ruthless casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who, when crossed will "kill you, then he'll go to work on you".  #2: Ocean's motives seem suspect when it becomes known to Rusty that Ocean's former wife, Tess (Julia Roberts) is now the girlfriend of Benedict.  Is Danny committed to the success of the heist or will he compromise everything to show up Benedict in an attempt to get Tess back?<br /><br />  Clooney continues to develop into a top-notch leading man by improving on the smoothness he first demonstrated in earlier Soderbergh film, "Out of Sight".  He brings a swagger to the screen that is reminiscent of Sinatra's 'Rat Pack' days.  Garcia is perfectly cast as the menacing Benedict in this film.  The viewer can taste the venom dripping off every word he utters.  The performances of Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Brad Pitt, Bernie Mac, and Elliott Gould add a degree of panache to the proceedings.  The Asian actor who played the contortionist was a unique 'twist' (no pun intended).  The Malloy brothers, played by Casey Affleck and Scott Caan don't really bring much to the screen other than there juvenile bickering, but they are necessary to plot.  The one truly disappointing performance is turned in by Julia Roberts as Tess Ocean.  Roberts seems like she has very little to do here other than pose as window dressing and upbraid Danny for being a 'bad boy'.  I don't know if it was just the material are just a poor performance, but an actress of Roberts' caliber shouldn't fail to register in a movie like this.  That gripe aside, though, "Ocean's 11" is as good a time as one can have at the movies.  If only more 'fun' flicks like this could be made.</p></body></html>

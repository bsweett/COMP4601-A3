<meta name="summary" content="A DARK SIDE OF JOHN WAYNE"></head><body><p>I was told that THE SEARCHERS was perhaps the best John Wayne movie ever made. Believe it or not, I'd never seen it before. So when I saw that the blu-ray was on sale at amazon for under $10 I decided what the heck, let's give it a go. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Wayne stars as Ethan Edwards, a rough and tumble man of the west comes home after fighting for the south in the Civil War. As the film opens, we see a woman through the front door of her house, Wayne on horseback riding to the house. This is the home of his brother and his family, a home that Ethan knew before the war. As the film moves on we get the idea that there was once something between Ethan and Martha, his brother's wife, but nothing is said aloud.<br /><br />Ethan is greeted by his brother and his family, a nephew, two nieces and a young man named Martin Polly (Jeffrey Hunter) who Ethan saved as a child, the sole survivor of an Indian attack on a wagon train. But the reunion doesn't last long when the next morning a group of men on horseback show led by Rev. Capt. Clayton (Ward Bond). It seems a group of Indians have run off with homesteader Jorgensen's cattle and they're about to search for them. Ethan insists his brother remain home but Martin goes along.<br /><br />Following the trail they discover that the cattle were stolen for a reason: to get them away from the settler's homes so they could be attacked. They split when riding back to cover both places. Ethan and Martin return to find the farm ablaze and the bodies of everyone but Lucy and Debbie, the two nieces now presumed kidnapped. This ignites a search that last most of the film as Ethan and Martin head out to rescue the girls.<br /><br />It would be so easy to offer bits and pieces of the story now, to tell you who makes it when and who doesn't. But that would take away what is an effective piece of story telling done by master director John Ford. He and Wayne made many movies together and many consider this one to be their best. The way he frames scenes, the way he moves his actors is amazing and in turn presents a story that you don't realize until it finishes.<br /><br />Watching the extras also helped me see so many of the things I missed while watching. We're a movie going public used to extreme violence when watching films these days. This film offers up violent images without actually showing them. The scene where Wayne enters what appears to be a smoke house to find the bodies of his brother and sister in law is gripping. You know how he found them by the look on his face, not by seeing the actual bodies. And in some ways that's more disturbing.<br /><br />One thing I was aware of with this film was the subtle discussion of racism involved in it. Made when this was a somewhat taboo topic, Ford and Wayne brought it to the forefront here. Several characters have this discriminatory view of the Indians in the film that carries on to their captives as well. The search for the girls takes 5 years and during that time young Debbie becomes a woman. The question of whether to bring her back or to kill her since she's been touched in more ways than one by her captor is central to the film. On one hand Ethan is ready to do what he considers his duty in killing her, on the other Martin, part Indian himself, is willing to do all he can to stop Ethan.<br /><br />This film offered something different for Wayne than previous roles. Before he was the hero, the cowboy, the one guy everyone wanted to be. As Ethan he's questionable at times whether it's wondering where he got the money he gives his brother or in the way he handles various situations. As the film progresses we witness a slow change over the years as Ethan's search for vengeance causes him to do worse deeds than when the search began. He's not a nice guy but he is someone you wish was on your side.<br /><br />The entire cast does a commendable job here. Each of them plays their roles note perfect. Veteran actors who starred in numerous Wayne films present themselves here as well as they've ever done. Ward Bond is cantankerous and at the same time a viable force for the old west. Hank Worden as Mose Harper portrays the man as perhaps simple but at the same time perhaps not. Maybe it's a face he puts on to keep out of harm's way. But the best cast member is Monument Valley.<br /><br />Like almost all of Ford's westerns, this one was shot in Monument Valley. Cut off from civilization for real, the cast and crew weathered some truly dangerous moments to bring this film to life. But its worth it was you view some breathtaking scenery. As I watched I thought to myself that while Frederick Remington captured the spirit and beauty of the old west on canvas, Ford was able to do the same on film.<br /><br />Like I said when I started, the film is available in blu-ray format for under $10 at amazon.com. It's worth that and more. I may not agree with the idea that this is the best western ever made or even Wayne's best western, but I will say that it ranks up there in the top. If you've never seen this one, make it a point to do so.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Semi-Sweet"></head><body><p>A religious, small town in the French countryside receives newcomers Vianne (Juliette) Binoche and her daughter.  They come dressed in red, and soon open a chocolate shop across from the church on the first week of Lent.  Scenes of  townspeople in confession describing the delicious chocolates are meant to be titillating.  Chocolate treats from the new shop is described sensually with double-meaning, including sex and other sins of enjoyment.<br /><br />The mayor launches a campaign to get rid of the new chocolate shop that is causing so much excitement in this once sleepy little village.  Then the children see "pirates" along the river and Vianne's daughter runs to her mother announcing the landing of the swarthy crew.  It is a band of Irish river people and headed by a handsome Roux (Johnny Depp  - who plays pirates well).  The beautiful Vianne and the handsome Roux become romantic as they understand each other as outsiders and agents of change for all they touch.<br /><br />"Chocolat" is a sweet movie, but trite in that  it suggests that all a person needs to liberate their soul, forget all the wrongs done to them, and become happy is a piece of candy.  There is a "leave it to Beaver" feel to the movie - too perfect, and the dialogue is often boring.  Judi Dench plays a role as a local diabetic who does not want to give in to her disease.  She keeps eating the sweets and enjoying life despite her critical condition.  I felt pain in all the actors trying to keep a French accent going - it did not come naturally for most in the film.<br /><br />Overall, enjoyable and more of a "chick flick" with a sweet chocolate shop princess and a swarthy pirate to bring it to a Disney ending.</p></body></html>

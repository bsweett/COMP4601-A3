He stayed true to the spirit of the original story in many  respects and kept you guessing and on your toes for a while... but the  movie languished and it was pretty flat when it was all over.<p>There is  one awesome scene, in which you see the headless horseman exiting his  hidden lair... seeing that just once almost makes the movie worth seeing  (almost).<p>I'm not sure what was missing, but something was. The film was  good at startling the audience in many places and the costumes and  backdrops were excellent... a feast for the eyes for this genre.  I can't  imagine ever seeing this film again, however... it just left too much to be  desired.  There were a few light, humorous moments that were sadly too few  and far between in the film.  After seeing a film by Burton like &quot;Ed  Wood,&quot; and knowing what he is capable of, this film was a  disappointment.</p></body></html>

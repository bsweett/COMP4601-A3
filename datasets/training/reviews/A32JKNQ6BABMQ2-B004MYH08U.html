<meta name="summary" content="ok"></head><body><p>this movie has a rich,spoiled brat with a D@#$#$^&^ for a father.he is no super hero.he does what he does for kicks.he's no mastermind.he has no cool moves.he wasnt zapped by gamma,chemicals or atomic energy.he has no powers.he claims to be the green hornet when, in fact,the guy he callsa he side kick posesses all of those traits.kado fights crime.kado is a super genius.kado is trained in the martial arts.so the spoiled rich kid funds all of the cool toys,like the weopon car,and takes all of the credit when the other guy is doing everything.<br />  honestly,im just pleased this wasnt just another horribly sick and duisgusting DC movie like "couroline","kick arse",or "watchmen".i dont know a lot about the green hornet comic book so i cant tell you if they followed the story right.<br />  on "myth busters",they proved that the tire blades would not work that well.they also proved that a car couldnt ride around with the back half missing.thirdly,they said the mounted machine guns could work but only at close range.but its a movie ,not a science test.so thats ok with me.<br />  so the green hornet is rich like batman,spoiled like a rich kid,wings it like kick arse and thats about it.its just hard liking a super hero who's such a dork all the time.now his buddy kado,they shouldve made the movie about him!i say skip this one unless you're really into comic books.it comes on the movie channels a lot.watch it there.</p></body></html>

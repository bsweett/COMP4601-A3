The directors take such a different approach to the films.<br />Alien is a piece of movie history.<br />Brilliant from start to finish.<br />Masterfully acted and directed.<br />Superbly paced.<br />One of the many movies you simply can not miss and should probably own by now.<br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

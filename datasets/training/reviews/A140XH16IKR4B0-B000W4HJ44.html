I loved its youthful energy. I loved its message of inclusion of those who don't fit a standard pattern of looks or behavior. I loved the music and especially the dance sequences. And I especially loved the fact that it championed black styles of dance and music without dismissing white styles out of hand.<br /><br />"Hairspray" is the story of ingenous Tracy Turnblad, a short, heavyish high school student who dreams of dancing on a local TV teen dance show in early 1963. She is opposed by moralists (her friend's mother, Prudy), her protective parents, and the larger culture, represented by the station manager, a former beauty queen who is managing the fortunes of her ownmean, but not-untalented daughter. Traci works through all these obstacles, befriending a detention hall's wortth of talented black students, plotting to enter the dance content and to intergrate Baltimore TV while she is at it.<br /><br />The film hit all the right notes and much of the credit goes to the acting. John Travolta's turn as Edna Turnblad, Tracy's Mom, was too-precious at first, but eventually found its feet. Michelle Pfeiffer was stunning as witchy vampy Velma Von Tussle. Queen Latifah lived up to her name as leader of the the black kids and the host of the TV show's once-a -month "Negro Day." The high energy of the fisst half of the film was deliberately tuned down for the more somber 3rd quarter in which characters worked out seeming infidelities and setbacks. But this just set up the explosive last quarter of the film, in which the opoosing forces had their showdown on the dancefloor.<br /><br />Prior to seeing the movie, I knew practically nothing about Hairspray, so I had no expectations about whether it would measure up to the Jon Waters original or the Broadway play. But the film stood on its own. There was little campiness or post-modern irony in the film, which was fine by me, and it got the optimistic tone, the peradoxes and the look of the 1960s just right. The film was as guiless as Tracy herself, and did not try to make cheap points about tacky clothes or furnishings. Even Tracy's dad, played amiably by Christopher Walken, was not played as a snarky wiseguy, but as a man completely dedicated to his silly work (he ran a local jokeshop)and imprevious to even the most tempting of diversions.<br /><br />Hairspray has not a mean bone in its body. It's beside the point that civil rights were not won on the basis of a few sign-carrying kids, one integrated TV show, or that the 1960s were an unlikely time for romance to bloom across racial lines. The larger message was clear: we are all dancers under the skin, and ought to bring the best of what we have, combine it with the best of what others have to give, and produce something to which we can all dance together. We are far from that reality, but works like "Hairspray" show that sometimes, the na?ve dreams of innocents are worth following.</p></body></html>

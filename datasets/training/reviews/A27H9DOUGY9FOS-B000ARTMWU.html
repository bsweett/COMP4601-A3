<meta name="summary" content="A Conventional Slasher, Very Conventional, Topped Off By An Unnecessary And Illogical Conclusion"></head><body><p>OK, I'm pretty easy going when it comes to this type of film. I never expect too much--I don't expect redeeming value, I don't expect character development, I don't expect great acting. Heck, most of the time--I don't even expect much of a story. Having caught Alexandre Aja's effective remake of "The Hills Have Eyes," I was more than willing to give this French (but poorly dubbed) entry in the slasher genre a chance. Well, now, I'm not really sure if it was worth it.<br /><br />The film has a pretty standard setup. Some have already noticed its similarity to Dean Koontz's "Intensity," which is apt--but that, too, already followed pretty conventional guidelines. As two girls are staying in a desolate family home of one of them, a rural madman comes a knocking. Jumping right into a brutality and unpleasantness, various members of the family are dispatched and/or attacked. One girl manages to elude the madman while the other is taken captive. The film has plenty of effectively tense moments during the "house" sequence. It sets itself up as a nasty bit of brutality, but nothing particularly original.<br /><br />Intent on helping her friend, the free girl rides with and/or chases the kidnapper's van for the remainder of the picture. Things get a bit sillier, but it is what it is. You know you're just biding time until the final confrontation. Again, I know there is an audience for this--but as our heroine never displayed much ingenuity, she wasn't really someone I cared about. Mainly the film is "Hide and Seek" followed by "Hide and Seek" with more "Hide and Seek" after that--Not a lot of diversity, I guess I'm saying.<br /><br />Now, then, in the last 15 minutes--the surprise twist is unveiled. I have seen this device used in countless other movies, and it can be a tremendous revelation. But not here. Had it been done with any sort of logic, it might have enhanced the film. I don't want to give anything away, so let's just say that a perfectly detailed film is needed to pull it off. A film where this device is used must be a thing of precision. "High Tension" just isn't that movie. The twist here makes sense in the context of the picture, however it is not logically supported by what has transpired. For anyone who thinks it is ingenious, I'd like to sit down, have a cup of coffee, and list the dozens and dozens of inconsistencies that just don't work. That said, it irritated me more than anything. What was going to be a 3 star review for derivative unpleasantness with some chills turned into about 1 1/2 stars for being nonsensical.

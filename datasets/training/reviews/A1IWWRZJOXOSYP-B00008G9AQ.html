Having read the book, I was impressed by how recognizable the film was, very like the original.  Chris Columbus directed "Rent," "Mrs. Doubtfire," & "Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone," as it was titled in the USA.  The young actors who are the leads fill the film well and seem to be growing in ability with each of the films. Daniel Radcliffe created a stir by taking off his clothes on the British stage for Equus and has appeared in "The Tailor of Panama."  As Harry Potter, he does a good job of showing Harry's stubbornness, his loyalty and compassion.  Rupert Grint was in "Driving Lessons" in 2006.  As Ron Weasley he is the sidekick who can stand by Harry, even when he doesn't understand.  Emma Watson seems a perfect choice to play the brainy Hermione Granger.  I greatly enjoyed this film.  From Moaning Myrtle to Dobby to Lucius Malfoy's malevolent snicker to the visuals as Harry slides down into the chamber, Columbus kept the pacing building right to the climax.  Harry Potter unravels very much like a mystery story with the twist that the magical world events make the clues pure delightful fantasy.  Words like "muggles" seep into our vocabulary with perfectly clear understanding.  The bonus DVD is full of interesting cast interviews of the younger actors, the villains and the teachers.  This is one of my favorite rainy day films to watch again & again.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

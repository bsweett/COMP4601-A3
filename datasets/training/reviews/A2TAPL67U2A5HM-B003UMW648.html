<meta name="summary" content="The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"></head><body><p>The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is the second installment in the Narnia series and was filmed in 2008. This time the directors have taken more liberties with the plot and storyline and it is not as faithful to the novel as the first movie. Still the movie is a very nice fantasy movie that has Christian and religious elements to it. Lucy's great faith in Aslan makes her connection to him unique as the others have more doubt. The special effects are great and the music is truly magnificent. A movie to enjoyed by older children as some of the scenes might be a bit scary for wee ones. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.</p></body></html>

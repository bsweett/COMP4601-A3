She had me hooked from the first time I saw her in Batman. She is fantastic and so dang hot. This is a great tail of murder, mystery, and betrayl. Just watch the movie for the acting. Kevin Spacey and Russel Crowe are fantastic. They are easily two of the best in the business. Guy Pearce also has a great performance. He's so great he suprised me he was so bad in The Time Machine. You got to see L.A. Confidential. If you love murder, betryal and mystery then it's the perfect movie for you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Let The Bidding Begin!..."></head><body><p>HOSTEL 2 picks up where the first one left off, w/ the survivor from HOSTEL living a terrified, paranoid existence. We soon learn his fate. The scene switches to Rome, where two beautiful females are obviously the next pair to be lured into another lethal torture session. Of course, as in the first film, the set up is half the fun. This time, we even get to see what it's like to be one of the zillionaire clients who pay big bucks to be merciless murderers. We also get a peek into the bidding process that decides which rich sadist will get to live out his / her particular fantasy. H2 is a worthy sequel, and should definitely give the members of GAGG (Grannies Against Gross Gore) something to moan about...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="By Far One of the Most Exciting Movies EVER Filmed"></head><body><p>I don't see how anyone can possibly give this film anything less than 5+ stars (if I could, I'd give it six.)  Some folks simply refuse to sit through Foreign Language flicks, and ultimately, they are losing out on experiencing a magical epic that deserves a hallowed spot atop any Top Ten list.  The special effects are dazzling as the cast literally flies, straddles tree tops and scales walls at 90 degree angles.  The cast is brilliant, especially the starring female leads, both of whom deserved Oscar nods (again, the foreign language aspect most likely kept them out of consideration).  In every way, Ang Lee completely (and seemingly effortlessly) surprises and engages each viewer.  I found myself gasping, clapping and oohing at the screen, despite seeing it by myself (again, my American friends resisted the Mandarin, though english dubbed and subtitled versions are available on DVD, but never/rarely are they as good as the original.)  I am not one for martial arts, nor for flights of fantasy.  Nor, for that matter, do I attend war flicks or action/adverture movies that often.  But this film has stuck with me now for over a year and is likely to remain in my heart and mind forever.  Read the subtitles, and miss this movie at your own risk - it is far superior to &quot;Gladiator&quot; and completely unprecedented in terms of Ang Lee's past brilliant successes (from &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; to &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; to &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; - all favorites of mine - nothing ever prepared me for this magical odessey!)  Easily one of the best films released in the past 50 years, and sure to rank high in future AFI lists, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; earns its stripes and its 5 stars in every scene, in every sequence, and in every way!  You will be inspired and awed by this instant classic!</p></body></html>

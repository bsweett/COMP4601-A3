<meta name="summary" content="Dakota Fanning steals every scene."></head><body><p>Hide and Seek has some awkward moments but overall, this movie is  quite scary and intriguing. Great performances by Robert De Niro, Elisabeth Shue, and of course Dakota Fanning. Fanning makes this film work, she is a remarkable talent! Don't understand why people despise this film, hey it's not gonna win any awards but it's worth a view or two. Give it a try!</p></body></html>

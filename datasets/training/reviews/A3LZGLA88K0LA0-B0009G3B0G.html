<meta name="summary" content="ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD"></head><body><p>One of my favorite movie songs of all time (We Have All the Time in the World, originally from the James Bond movie ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE) is used in the end credits of this unusual, but engrossing, film.  Oscar winner Adrien Brody gives a strong performance as a Gulf War veteran who is accused of murdering a patrolman and sentenced to an asylum for the criminally insane, where he is subjected to unorthodox therapy from a good intentioned, if somewhat, psychotic doctor.  The script never clarifies how much of what we view is reality and how much could be the delusions of a sick man.  However, an element of time travel is introduced, and it is this device that forms the crux of this well made, if somewhat dissatisfying excursion into the real and unreal.  Brody is given good support from Keira Knightley as his love interest; Daniel Craig as a fellow patient; Jennifer Jason Leigh as a sympathetic doctor with her own agenda; Kris Kristofferson as the man behind the experiments, Kelly Lynch as the spaced out wife Brody rescues; and even Mackenzie Phillips in a small role as a brutish nurse.  THE JACKET, directed by John Maybury, may be an example of style over substance, but it does hold your interest.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Arthur with an Uzi"></head><body><p>Loyalty, Chivalry and Romantic Love are unusual subjects for the powerhouse movie producer, Jerry Bruckheimer whose movies usually have to do with Heroes with bad attitudes and badder guns. And even though the friction between his other films and his reputation for Wham-Bang movies might have made for an interesting re-telling of the King Arthur legend, "Arthur" is not.<br />The King Arthur of Clive Owen is like no other seen on the screen before. His Arthur is no romantic poet as in "Camelot" nor is there a Round Table or Sword in the Stone in sight. Owen's Arthur is deeply troubled and gravely concerned about the Roman conquest of his country, Britain. His Arthur manages to be heroic which is a major accomplishment what with all the silliness that surrounds him, mise-en-scene wise.<br />Keira Knightly has the right attitude for this film in that she plays her role of Guinevere with her tongue firmly planted in her beautiful cheek especially when she turns from a Lady to a harridan with a bow in artfully applied blue make-up.<br />Don't go to "Arthur" looking for a reverential bow to Ladies and Knights of the Round Table but if you are a fan of the Bruckheimer treatment, you could do far worse than what is on screen here.</p></body></html>

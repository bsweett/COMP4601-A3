<meta name="summary" content="Overall a fun movie, if one has realistic expectations"></head><body><p>After watching "The Day After Tomorrow," and after allowing a few days to really think about my viewing experience, I would say that generally speaking I enjoyed it, and would recommend it. While not perfect by any means, "The Day After Tomorrow" delivers quite a thrilling ride, for the movie-goer who likes a lot of action, good special effects and drama thrown in.<p>As I said, it isn't perfect. Unfortunately, it suffers from a very mediocre script. In addition, some elements of the plot are highly cliched. For example, the homeless man who goes from social outcast to one of the heroes who survives all the peril. In addition, I found the obligatory love story between the son and that girl almost laughable. <p>But that's really all the negative comments I have. The rest of the movie works. Dennis Quaid hands-down gives the best performance out of everyone; in fact I would say that his character is the one whom the audience can connect to the most and therefore care about. We can care about the other characters too, but IMO his performance makes his character the most "human" and vulnerable while also determined.<p>Finally, any movie that can make one think after they leave the theater is a good movie in my book. And "The Day After Tomorrow" does just that. I walked out of the theater realizing that the scenario I just saw could very well happen in real life (although I think it would be a lot messier and more chaotic than Hollywood's choreographed and CGI version of it). Still, it does make one think, all politics of the movie put aside. The dangers are real no matter what the politics are, and that seems to be the movie's true message. While I doubt it will win any Academy Award, it's definitely worth seeing, especially on the big screen.</p></body></html>

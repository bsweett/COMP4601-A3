<meta name="summary" content="Charming romantic comedy"></head><body><p>Will Smith is the "Date Doctor", a man who knows everything about coaching other people towards romance.  He knows all of the angles and he shares them with male clients who are in love and feel that the object of their affection is out of their reach.  His main client is a klutzy accountant, played by Kevin James, who is in love with a wealthy divorcee.  Meanwhile Smith is using all of his romantic ploys to win over a gossip columnist, played by Eva Mendes.  It's a tossup as to who is the most leery about relationships, Smith or Mendes.  Each has been hurt before and each will do whatever it takes to avoid any further hurt.  This movie is full of laughs and, although the end is predictable, getting there is lots of fun.</p></body></html>

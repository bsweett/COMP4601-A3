Every once and awhile you get something unique and surprising and it makes it all worthwhile.  A story of two 19th Century magician's (nicely played by Hugh Jackman & Christian Bale) whose bitter rivalry is founded in a tragedy allows Christopher Nolan to do some movie prestidigitation as well, telling his tale cutting back and forth between the two men while moving forward and backward in time as well.<br /><br />The film offers nicely rendered period detail of London and Colorado Springs, combines a bit of lore (the magician's three acts of The Pledge, The Turn and The Prestige), a bit of history (the rivalry of Thomas Edison and Nikolai Tesla) a bit of intrigue, a bit of mystery and more.  It is complex but comprehensible if you're paying attention.  In fact it demands your attention as any good illusion does.<br /><br />With this as it's frame, the Nolan brothers explore the meaning and nuances of indentity, technical competence versus showmanship and presentation (Bordin & Argien, Tesla & Edison), and the creative value of obsession and the price paid for indulging one's obsessions, and, of course, the fascination of magic, that most theatrical manipulation of truth and illusion.  A bit of movie magic here, I found The Prestige intriguing and mesmerizing, much like a first rate feat of legerdemain, clever and original.</p></body></html>

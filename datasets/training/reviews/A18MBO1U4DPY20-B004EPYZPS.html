<meta name="summary" content=""AUTO-PILOTISH DIRECTION""></head><body><p>I knew I had to see this film when I saw the trailer. A trailer usually promises what can be deemed as a faithful description of the film. Watching Super 8 was like watching a 2 hour trailer of a film which never really begins, I kept waiting to be awed but the film lacks an intriguing storyline. I haven't read the book and don't intend to but I paid good money to watch this and came out feeling rather ripped off. I cannot fathom Spielberg made such a lousy film especially since he has BACK TO THE FUTURE to his credit. When I think science fiction, I think of films such as - District 9, War of the worlds, Jusassic Park and such. Definitely not Super 8. It's the kind of film you will never ever remember for anything, not even for the fat kid who thinks he should be a director. No irony and the direction seemed very auto-pilot'ish.</p></body></html>

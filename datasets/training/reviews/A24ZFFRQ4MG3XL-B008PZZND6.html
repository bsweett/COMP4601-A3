How could you not.  There was stunning scenery and a fantastic score, amazing script and last but not least, some of the best acting we've seen in many years.<br /><br />After working together on Brokeback Mountain, these two cowboys find more than just a friendship - they find forbidden love.  Their first meeting happend in 1963 where homophobia would have been far worse than it is today.  What follows is a moving story of two men trying to come to grips with their feelings for each other and their family life at home with their wives and children.<br /><br />This is a must see for everyone.  You may not think you'll like it, but you will be blown away.  It's one of the best movies I've seen in such a long time and this was thoroughly enjoyable.</p></body></html>

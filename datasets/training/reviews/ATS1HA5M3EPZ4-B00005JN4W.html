<meta name="summary" content="Superheroes Rock!"></head><body><p>With the superhero craze in full swing, Pixar and Disney (mostly Pixar) are capitalizing on the success with their own version of the Superhero universe.<br /><br />Following the adventures of Mr. Incredible, the movie introduces us to the heroes in their heyday, when the city loved them and counted on them, until an ungrateful `jumper' sues them.  Suddenly in a swing of political correctness, the heroes are all asked to step down and become `normal'.  They are forced to never reveal who they are what they can do, being dragged down in everyday existence.<br /><br />Mr. Incredible, voiced with great charisma and world weary exhaustion by Craig T. Nelson, watches his life get more frustrating by the day.  His desire for the old days is overly apparent as he continues to play the hero, helping old ladies find loopholes in policies enforced by his insurance company employer.  He feeds his overwhelming desire in nightly excursions with his buddy, Frozone (voiced by Samual L. Jackson) listening to Police and Fire bands in order to find people to rescue or criminals to catch.<br /><br />One day he receives a job offer that could put him back in the role of superhero.  In taking the job, things get crazy and whole new menace begins to unfold.  In order to keep this review short, I will say that this movie is more exciting and fun to watch then almost anything else that was released in 2004, with the exception of Spider-Man 2.  The Incredibles is awesome, not only utilizing elements of comic books, but bringing in the real life detriments that could come with that line of work.  Also, strangely noted, is the James Bond-like spy movie elements when Mr. I goes to the remote island for the job offer.<br /><br />Holly Hunter and Jason Lee round out the voice characterizations, giving great quality to the cast and making the movie full of life.  The Incredibles is great fun and highly recommended.  I can't wait for the DVD to be released.</p></body></html>

After scoring classics with Raging Bull and Goodfellas, a lot of people still wouldn't give him recognition like an Oscar and while the basic opinion now is that he's bound to get at least one for his recent film the Departed, the essential feeling is that they should've given him one earlier. Casino, released after little seen Age of Innocence can be seen as "return to form" and while it's gritty, unrelenting and quite violent, it's also way too long and you never seem to invest in it that much.<br /><br />Taking place in the 1970's, Sam "Ace" Rothstein starts becoming a bigger player in the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas, letting players win enough and recognizing foul play and cheaters. His long-time friend, Nicky Santoro, is a pretty hyperactive and, quite frequently, violent man that becomes well-known in Vegas as a mobster-like figure. While one becomes entangled in the politics of running a casino, the other gets increasingly violent and out of control, especially when it concerns Ace's wife, Ginger.<br /><br />It's always weird watching a Scorsese film because at times I notice that I actually like the film better when I see it the 2nd time. Maybe it was the hype from everyone but watching Taxi Driver, Goodfellas or Raging Bull I thought "yeah I thought they were good movies but where's this 'masterpiece' everyone keeps saying?" But then in Goodfellas' case and moreso with Raging Bull, everything started to click. The problem with Casino is that even repeated viewings, it's still kind of a messy movie. It's hard to invest in emotionally with everything, the film's way too long with scenes that don't really go anywhere or just simply a lack of focus. It's certainly a more ambitious looking film than Goodfellas but it just seems a bit too scattered.<br /><br />How's the acting? Very straight across the board. Before being replaced by Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert de Niro seemed to be Scorsese's go-to guy and he's of course great in the film. While he did show a more restrained menace in Heat, here he's practically vicious in certain scenes and likable. Joe Pesci of course plays the manic buddy who swears constantly and with a short fuse. Sharon Stone actually did receive a nomination for her work here and it was a welcome one too. Everyone else is fine too but primarily the work here is by the 3 leads and they all pull it off.<br /><br />Is it a Scorsese classic? Not really. What it have been, had certain decisions had been made? Yep. While to me it's still Raging Bull for all-time favorite film of his, Casino is at least worth a look but there's enough to like here, it's just not quite enough.</p></body></html>

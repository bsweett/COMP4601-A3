Not a terribly memorable sequel in terms of story line or acting; counting more on gore scenes to shock the audience instead of presenting any real substance in plot or theme.<br /><br />Unlike its predecessor where Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) was more of a secondary character, this film is focused entirely on finding the escaped cannibal doctor.  FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore instead of Jodie Foster)tags along with an obnoxious fellow agent (Ray Liotta) to capture the elusive doctor.  She also gets help from one of Lecter's former victims named Mason Verger (Gary Oldman.)<br /><br />Not a terribly memorable sequel except for graphic scenes that, quite frankly, go too far in the domain of bad taste (literally.)  I really don't need up-close, in your face, scenes of human dissection and dismemberment to imagine what it would be like to be served as someone else's dinner.  The final scene displaying how human brains should be served was too disgusting even for my broad tastes in gratuitous violence.  The graphic content of this film was so extreme that Jodie Foster refused to reprise the role she had played so well in the previous film.<br /><br />All in all, I find this to be one of the worst films directed by Riddley Scott and certainly the worse of the four Hannibal Lecter films to be made ('Manhunter' was the first one.)  Worth renting for those who have the stomach but, again, this is certainly not a film for the faint of heart or those who have a light stomach for blood and guts.</p></body></html>

He basically proclaimed that if no one was selling condoms, liquor, Greek paraphernalia, or telling them about a party, then they shouldn't be bugging him on the way to class to sell a newspaper. I was absolutely outraged and wrote a nice long article to that newspaper and another publication to make sure my voice was heard. There are far too many elitist people in this world too wrapped up in their own personal drama to reflect the fact that they should be thankful for what they have.  In this movie, we learn about a man who has made a bad business decision by buying medical equipment and going into debt trying to make a profit from it.  With his employment issues, he also has a wife who is working overtime and a son who has a very unprofessional daycare instructor.  To make matters worse, his wife leaves him and he is evicted from his apartment.  But the strongest part about it is that even with all of the things going on around him, he is still so determined to sell his equipment, take care of his son, be civil with his wife, and try to find a career that works. I read an article in JET magazine about the real life Chris Gardner, and one of the shelter employees said that it was rare that someone could come out of poverty into being a millionaire. This story had to be told--if not for those selfish people who don't understand why people are standing on the corner because they have no place else to go; that homeless men have a rough time getting into those shelters because so many are for women and children; and how charities work.  Whether it was Christmas or not, this type of story needs to be told because so many (like that simple-minded writer I spoke of earlier) turn a deaf ear to anybody not in their economic group. It's aggravating and stressful.  I appreciated Smith being apart of this movie so much.  It's cool when he tries his hand at other genres (science fiction, action, documentaries) and I love that he will take on so many different roles, from killing aliens to molding into a very strong and admirable homeless man who will succeed by all means necessary.  This was a very touching film and I loved every minute of it.  There is nothing more adorable than to see a father who loves his child, and I'm so glad that Smith's son was able to play the part of the son.<br />On top of that, when I was leaving the theater, this thugged out dude was on his cell phone talking to a friend about how much this movie motivated him and made him want to make money.  When Will Smith touches brothas to want to make legitimate money, there's no way I can give it anything but a thumbs up.  A lady I know who reads NOTHING but grocery lists raced to the bookstore to buy Chris' book.  Once again, this movie touched a lot of people in different ways.<br /><br />Cons: None.</p></body></html>

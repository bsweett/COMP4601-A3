With the exception of a rare few like Jurassic Park III, The Godfather III, Spider-Man 3, and most likely Pirates 3, it's hard to be original on the third go-around and even harder to sustain our interest.  It may be of some fun, and Shrek 3 is to some degree; however, it has lost much of its charm and often feels strained and contrived.  The first 30 minutes of Shrek the Third is sensationally funny as we see a series of bloopers with him trying to do kingly duties; however, the story is substantially slower in the last two thirds and often unfunny.<br /><br />I had my opinion, but I wanted to know what my kids, ages 10 and 14, to whom this film is mostly aimed at thought of this film without any bias from me and my son said, "It was alright, but seemed to drop dead after the first half," and my daughter said, "It was okay, but not nearly as good as the first two.  The second will stay my favorite."<br /><br />I couldn't agree more with my kids.  I'll rest my case there.</p></body></html>

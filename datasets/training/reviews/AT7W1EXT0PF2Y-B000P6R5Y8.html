Unfortunately, they made this film. My only theory is that they figured they would save money since they merely had to hire a hack writer to turn the novel into a screenplay. The only problem was they picked a book that was actually good. While this film isn't perfect, it's one of the few diamonds in the rough of 21sy century American cinema. The characters in this movie go to a school where they do nothing but beat on instruments and sing folk songs. They also have recess sometimes where bullies pretty much have the run of the show, even charging exorbitant fees for using the bathroom facilities. If this was your life, you'd want to live in a fantasy world as well. The movie gets of to a great start by having the hero being forced to wear his sisters pink and white shoes to school. Any guy knows that would be his worst nightmare and we immediately sympathize for the kid. What the movie boils down to is how hard it is to be an intelligent person when 90% of mankind are morons. Some wimpy viewers say the movie is just too sad to be a children's film. They'd rather their kids knew nothing about reality and how hard life can be and watch happy films about ogres passing gas. That's fine for those low lifes. But if you want to raise good children that are responsible and have morals, have them watch films like this. If you don't' God will hate you and send you to hell.</p></body></html>

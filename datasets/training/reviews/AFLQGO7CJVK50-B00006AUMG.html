<meta name="summary" content="Blade II"></head><body><p>Blade fights super-vampires in this one. This one is especially bloody and gruesome. Like the others, martial arts meets the occult in an all-out war. Ron Perlman(Hellboy,Sons of Anarchy,etc.) stars in this one as  as a bad guy. Easily as good as the other Blade movies. Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

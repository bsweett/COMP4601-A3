<meta name="summary" content="Not Collateral Damage! I said Collateral's a good movie!"></head><body><p>This sure is one hell of a great thriller with action and great humor. Jamie Foxx gives an outstanding performance as Max, a cab driver living a normal life, until the wrong guy steps into his cab. When Vincent (played by Cruise)goes into his cab, Max doesn't realize that this guy's a nutcase and a hitman. He then forces Max to drive him to all of his targets but Max refuses to go down without a fight.. The movie is excellent with a highly original and awesome plot, loads of great action and suspense scenes, one awesome shootout at a nightclub, lots of great humor, and one scene where Vincent completely destroys some punks that steal his briefcase. Beleive me, write this one down on your must see list. It's got the perfect cast, and everything else I already said. I recommend buying it though as you'll definitely want to rewatch it and own this one.</p></body></html>

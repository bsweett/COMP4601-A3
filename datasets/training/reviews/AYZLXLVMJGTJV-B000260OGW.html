Green open range, Calgary, Happiness, stagecoaches in mud so thick you have to dig a day to get them out, cattle runs, cooking out with all the cowboy stuff, pots hanging from something over a fire, biscuits, tin plates, coffee with smoke still on it, playing cards, thunderstorms with a tarp over your head and talking, rustling up brekkie, clear streams filled with clean rocks and pebbles with horses drinking the best sparkling water in the world, like in the Talisman, old towns dusty with supplies, fun books to pick the things you want to buy, candy stores with old fashioned candy in big glass jars, bathhouses, stabling your horses with someone, tlc with someone who just loves you to pieces, cleans the wounds, listens to you, listens to your dreams, listens to your prayers, gives you warm broth and never leaves, old saloon with sassparilla, talking in the moonlite with intimate thoughts spilling out like stars, playing a fiddle and dancing a jig, flower gardens with all kinds of flowers everywhere, bees and birds and bugs, fyne china with teacups...Love</p></body></html>

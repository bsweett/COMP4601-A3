It begins sinister and ends creepy, with the ride between vacillating from dull to melodramatic.  The high point of this flick is the story, not the acting.  Costner played the straightman half of his serial killer persona with the same flat, deadpan delivery he's played every character he's played in the last decade.  It works to a degree, as he is after all the passionless half of his persona.  He hits his stride in the scenes where he loses his cool.  Hurt, however, is very compelling in his role as the half of Brooks' that is the inner crazed killer.  He's got some great lines.  I do think that with both playing different sides of the same character, often in tandem, that brings a new challenge to being in the same scenes.  They had great timing and were the only actors who seemed to have chemistry in the film.  Mrs. Brooks may as well have been a prop, for all of her function surrounded validating the normality of Mr. Brooks.  His daughter's secrets brought the story to life, and in many ways her character was the real foil to Mr. Brooks and not the inner persona played by Hurt.  Moore overacted most of her role and just generally did not bring her to life at all.  That was a disappointment.  The story is incredibly sinister, which did not leave its visual needing much in the way of graphic gore.  However, the final hardcore scene of the film is definitely gratuitous shock, so much so that it detracted rather enhanced Mr. Brooks' fears of the future.  If you like shockers and thrillers this is a good film to see.  Don't let the stodgy acting distract you.</p></body></html>

One starts to realize fairly immediately that the time line sequence is out of order. This sort of fim really does owe a lot to film making techniqes popularized by Quentin Tarantino in "Pulp Fiction".  Armed with this knowledge it becomes fairly evident where the story is leading and it's probable end.<br /><br />Good performances throughout by the entire cast...although Sean Penn seems to play the same "tortured" persona he always plays.</p></body></html>

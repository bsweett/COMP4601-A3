Robert De Niro and Dakota Fanning give good performances in this movie. Full of twists and turns, Hide and Seek keeps you entertained.... especially with the surprise ending. After the loss of his wife by suicide, De Niro decides to move and try to start a new life with his daughter to help her get over the loss of her mother. After moving into their new home, the daughter develops an imaginary friend named Charlie. This is when she starts acting in an odd behavior. De Niro now tries to find out who Charlie is and why his daughter is changing before his eyes. Not a boring movie and a good thriller. It will keep you guessing until the very end as to who Charlie really is. I recommend any thriller fan rent this movie.</p></body></html>

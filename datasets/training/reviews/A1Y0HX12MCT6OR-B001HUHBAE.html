<meta name="summary" content="I really wanted to like this"></head><body><p>Zodiac's first hour or so was excellent, however once the killer's populatrity dwindled so did my interest in the film, and the last hour and a half of the cartoonist looking for clues draaaaaaaaged on. The film does a good job of showing the public stop caring about the Zodiac killer but it's not good at keeping my interest in it for two and a half hours. Thanks Dave but I think I'll stick with Se7en.</p></body></html>

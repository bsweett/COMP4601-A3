<meta name="summary" content="smart serial killer; dumb cop"></head><body><p>If it hadn't been for the dumbest cop ever born (the one played by Demi Moore), this would have gotten one more star.<br />Anyway, Costner does a marvelous job as a tormented serial killer addicted to thrill killing while also holding down a great job and doting on his wife and daughter.  The daughter, however, may be a budding serial killer herself, and he wants to save her from becoming like her father.<br />William Hurt also is in full creepy mode as a manifestation of Costner's dueling personality, while comedian Dane Cook plays a would-be killer who wants Costner to tutor him in how to do it and not get caught.<br />There is some intrusive techno music and a Matrix-like hallway shoot-out that could have been done better.  However, these are quibbles.  I had a bigger problem with Moore's distracting divorce battle, impulsiveness, and general arrogance.</p></body></html>

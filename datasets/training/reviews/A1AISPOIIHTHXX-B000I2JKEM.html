I still love the songs, characters and everything. So when they make the spiritual sequel, you're going to inevitably love it, unless they do something stupid. Well Corpse Bride isn't a failure, it's a bit "resting on laurels" feel. It's of course a visually striking movie but it doesn't feel as innovative as Nightmare was.<br /><br />Victor is having an arranged marriage with Victoria, which'll bring up the family's money of course. Completely blowing his vow rehearsal, he goes off to the woods to practice and places his ring on a skinny branch. Only it's not a branch but the finger of the Corpse Bride. Taken into the world of the dead, he must deal with not only his new bride's devotion but his intended fiance being married off to a slimy guy(as usual).<br /><br />Now for you parents out there who are very apprehensive about letting kids watch this kind of stuff, I'd say watch it with them rather than letting it be a babysitter. It can get creepy for kids and there's even morbid things such as a dead resident who literally separates himself. Of course it's animated and there's enough fairy tale qualities to keep it from being disturbing.<br /><br />Where the film shines is its animation and voice acting. More fluid and striking than Nightmare, it's obvious close to 15 years will improve the artform. And of course we have the upcoming Wallace and Gromit movie which shows we don't need fancy computers to tell stories. In the 5th collaboration with Tim Burton, Johnny Depp has that perfect shy guy voice and is very likable but we also have Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Burton's real-life love Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />Now the comparisons between this and Nightmare are obvious and very unwarranted although sometimes there's similarities. Victor goes into the woods where he's introduced to a new world, such as Jack finding the holiday trees. The bride falls apart literally at times just like Sally and Victor has a dead dog only this one isn't a flying ghost but rather a skeletal puppy. But that's like saying Sleepy Hollow is similar in look to Batman Returns. It's the same filmmaker so it's bound to have similar ideas.<br /><br />It's no Nightmare that's for sure but it's sure a great film overall.</p></body></html>

You really feel the wonder of old time Vegas where dreams do come true cometimes.  A great story with many layers, sprinkled with plenty of Pesci violence.  This is one to add to your Godfather, Goodfellas, and Donnie Brosco collection.  Lots of good extras, so make sure you get the Anniversary Edition.</p></body></html>

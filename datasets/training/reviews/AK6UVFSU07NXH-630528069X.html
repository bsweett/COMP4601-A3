<meta name="summary" content="Bruce Willis get down and dirty"></head><body><p>When &quot;Die Hard&quot; was first released it set a new standard for non stop action. I think one of the reasons for this is that virtually the whole movie was squeezed into the confines of one building. Bruce Willis may have struggled to shake off the Die Hard stereotype and make a success of other films but the Die Hard formula had no such problems. The number of Die Hard rip offs that have been made since '88 are too numerous to count.<br /><br />Credit has to go to the director John McTiernan for a lot of the appeal of the film. The tight shots on dramatic acting sequences, good use of claustrophobic spaces and the many visual surprises all went a long way to ripping our hearts from our chests. Of course this movie also had a fine script, not so much for the dialogue as for the story telling style. We are forced easily into the same misconceptions that the hero, John McClane, experiences and we are just as surprised as he, at each twist and turn in the plot.<br /><br />Willis plays John McClane, a New York cop visiting L.A. over Christmas in order to patch up his relationship with his Wife, Holly Gennero McClane, played by Bonnie Bedelia. Holly is a senior executive with a Japanese corporation, Nakatomi. John finds his Wife still at work in the Nakatomi building along with many other employees, having a Christmas party. Their reunion is not going well when the situation takes a further dramatic turn for the worse, as a group of terrorists take over the building.<br /><br />John, of course, is the only one quick thinking and lucky enough not to be taken hostage and proceeds to try and ruin the terrorists plans. On the plus side, they do not know he exists and he has one police issue revolver. On the down side, he has no shirt and no shoes. Neither of which seem like major issues but by the end of the film he will sorely regret not having foot ware and his singlet will be a write off.<br /><br />The terrorists are led by the coldly competent Hans Gruber, played very well by Alan Rickman. He makes a good adversary for Mr McClane because he is well prepared, ruthless and has a team of very well trained assistants. Unfortunately for him, John McClane is not a conventional thinker and is therefore hard to pin down.<br /><br />Along for the ride we are able to enjoy a few interesting minor characters, a sassy but thoughtful limo driver by the name of Argyle, a manic psychopath in Hans' group, called Karl, a nearly as manic heartless reporter, Thornburg, a twinkie munching sensitive cop, Sgt. Al Powell, a pair of blinkered FBI agents and a ridiculously incompetent police captain, called Dwayne T. Robinson. As you can see, Die Hard is chock full of deep and meaningful characterizations, which all go towards enhancing our viewing pleasure.<br /><br />For every success that John has, it seems he accumulates more injuries and more enthusiasm from his opponents. He is forced to crawl through air conditioning ducting, jump into elevator shafts, fall off the roof of the building, walk on broken glass and worst of all he is forced to make witty comments throughout the entire film.<br /><br />All in all, for non stop action that doesn't take itself too seriously, you can't beat Die Hard.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Over The Top and Just A Tad Over Done."></head><body><p>I knew that as successful that the first Pirates was there was no doubt going to be a sequel in the works. So this time when the trailers were being released for 'Pirates Of The Carribean: Dead Man's Chest' I was eager to return to the theaters and get great for another wave crashing roller coaster.<br /><br />With a successful first time around this movie got the same actors but a much bigger budget so now it was time for the story to take a back seat and let the special effects have their day in the sun. First and foremost the movie was not bad, it still had the same writters and cast so the jokes and action were still at its peak. Also casting Bill Nighey as Davey Jones was a stroke of genius because he also like Geoffrey Rush can nail the fierce pirate persona. The only thing was there were some scenes where it just didn't make any sense and also the movie was much longer than the first so there were points where things were just being taken too over the top to the point where a person can rise up in a crowded theater and scream 'Enough already!'<br /><br />Once again with more plot twists and very shocking cliffhanger ending, wehn the credits start rolling you will still put your hands together and clap and be a little happier because now you know the final instalment is on the way and you will finally get your answers.

<meta name="summary" content="Cute, Clever & Funny, but Rats in the Kitchen?"></head><body><p>My experience with rats in movies is generally not positive.  There were the killer rats in "Ben" and "Willard," the over-sized rats in "Food of the Gods," and the mega-rats in "Graveyard Shift."  Even though "Ratatouille" had a lot of positive press well before I purchased this movie, I must confess to being apprehensive.  My apprehension was (mostly) unfounded.<br /><br />Remy is an unusual mouse in that he likes to watch the cooking shows of the famous chef, Gusteau.  Remy also has an excellent nose, which his family puts to use to detect poisonous food.  Of course, Remy just wants to cook.  A farmer's wife discovers Remy during one of his sojourns into a farmhouse kitchen.  Remy's discovery soon leads to the discovery of his family and a hasty departure from the farm.<br /><br />After a harrowing journey, Remy ends up in Paris.  Remy soon finds his way to Gusteau's restaurant where he joins forces with Linguini, who is inept in just about everything he does, except for being Remy's hands.  Soon Linguini impresses everyone with his cooking ability, except for Chef Skinner, who planned on capitalizing on Gusteau's name by franchising it.  Linguini's apparent abilities make the restaurant famous again, until the local health inspector discovers rats in the kitchen.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was very creative.  I would never have thought of putting a rat into a restaurant as a chef.  I also thought having a rat control the actions of a human was an interesting twist on the usual role of rats in movies.  I laughed out loud in several places while watching this movie.  Some of the jokes were hilarious.  Other jokes were a little flat.  I also think there were some insider jokes, which were lost on me.  I liked the characters of Remy, Collette (wonderfully voiced by Jeneane Garofalo), Chef Skinner and most especially Anton Ego (extremely well voiced by Peter O'Toole).<br /><br />With all that I liked about this movie, I had a couple of issues, one structural and one personal.<br /><br />The structural issue is that the movie, which is pushing two hours in length, has some slow spots.  I found myself looking at the display on the DVD player to see how long the movie had been on.  I only do that when a movie fails to hold my interest.<br /><br />The personal problem I had was the scene with the rats in the restaurant.  It was bad enough when Remy was sitting on Linguini's hand, and then Linguini was handling food (ewwww), but to see all those rats in the restaurant all over the food preparation surfaces got to me.  Sorry, but that scene was yucky.<br /><br />This release has a nice share of extras.  The two best extras are the shorts, "Lifted," which is very funny, and "Your Friend the Rat," which is pretty good but not quite as funny as "Lifted."  There are deleted scenes that fans of the movie will enjoy, though they are still close to the storyboard stage.  There is another feature called "Fine Food and Film," which suggests some of the inspiration for the movie.  This movie also has a bunch of Easter eggs in it, but other web sites have already covered those well, so I will not repeat them here.<br /><br />If you like animation, especially Pixar's, then you will probably like "Ratatouille."  The characters are sympathetic and fun, and the humor is as well.  The only troubling scene is one involving food preparation in a restaurant and hundreds of mice.  Children will doubtless have little problem with the thought of rodents scampering over the scallions, or rats romping in the risotto.  That scene still makes me queasy.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

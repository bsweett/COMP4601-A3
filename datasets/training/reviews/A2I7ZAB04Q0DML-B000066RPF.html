<meta name="summary" content="History Has Never Been This Much Fun!"></head><body><p>From the trumpet flourish at the beginning of the film, followed by the approach of Arthur galloping on foot with the sounds of coconuts being smacking against one another by his minstrel, to the climactic finish of the film, when the Knights of Camelot are seized while attacking a French Castle for actions against a news commentator earlier in the film, has history been so humorously re-&quot;created&quot; as it has been in this brilliantly funny film by the British Troupe of comedic actors known affectionately by fans world wide as &quot;Monty Python&quot;.<p>&quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; is a tongue-in-cheek look at the lore surrounding the Arthurian Legend and his quest for the Holy Grail.  The film pulls no punches, taking jabs at everything from the political strife between the French and the British, the Catholic Church, the Inquisition, the British Aristocracy and just about every legend and myth surrounding King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable.<p>When Arthur (Graham Chapman) is approached by God to discover the secret resting place of the Holy Grail, he at once sets out on a quest to find it, picking up his entourage of knights along the way: Sir Lancelot the Brave (John Cleese), Sir Launcelot (Eric Idle), Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones), and Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin).<p>While on their quests, each face a variety of hilarious challenges, including the construction of a Trojan Rabbit, the approach of Castle Anthrax with the multidle of Vestial Virgins,<br />the rabbit with &quot;big, pointy, teeth&quot;, and of course, the Knights who say &quot;Ni&quot;.<p>Originally filmed in 1975, the movie has become a cult-classic, and a favorite for many generations of Monty Python enthusiasts.  Considered by many to be their most successful feature film, the Holy Grail relies on a careful combination of slapstick humor combined with clever writing and high-brow British wit.  Though some of the humor relates to the period the film was shot, most of it transcends any generation, poking fun at history with an originality and absurdity that is funny and entertaining.<p>Make sure to pay close attention to the many characters throughout the film, for many of the &quot;Python&quot; principals play more than one character.  In many instances, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones can be seen carrying on conversations with themselves.  Its one of the many hilarious twists that the Monty Pyhton troupe use in their films.<p>This is a great film for anyone who has yawned their way through a world history class in high-school or college.  It brings a slanted and hilarious version of history to life in a way that only the men of Monty Python can.<p>-Scott Kolecki</p></body></html>

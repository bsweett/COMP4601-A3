<meta name="summary" content="Now, That's Incredible!"></head><body><p>Bob Parr is doing his best to live a normal life. He's got a wonderful wife, three beautiful kids, and a nice home in the suburbs. But Bob hates his job as an insurance claims representative. He sits in a tiny office (even more tiny for Bob because he's a big man and his office has this huge pillar going up one side) answering the phone, typing on a keyboard, and trying to actually help people who have problems. But, Bob's boss (a very tiny man) hates Bob because Bob agrees to almost every claim that is made. Bob also has another problem. Bob is actually a superhero: Mr. Incredible. He used to travel around the globe fighting off the forces of evil and standing up for those who couldn't stand up for themselves. Then some guy who he saved from committing suicide decided to sue and all of America's superheroes had to go underground. Things haven't been the same since.<br /><br />One day, Bob gets really mad at work and throws his boss through a wall. He's fired, but a mysterious stranger offers Bob to opportunity to be Mr. Incredible again and Bob jumps at the chance. At first things go fine. But then Mr. Incredible gets in over his head (you know, the whole "I work best alone philosophy" and "I can't let my wife know I got fired" attitude). Eventually his wife, who happens to be Elastigirl, and kids come to the rescue and it's up to the Incredible family to save the world.<br /><br />Simply put, THE INCREDIBLES are simply incredible. THE INCREDIBLES is one of the best of Pixar's hits. The voice talents perfectly cast with Craig T. Nelson voicing Mr. Incredible and Holly Hunter voicing his wife Elastigirl and Samuel L. Jackson as Increcible's best friend, Lucius Best--better known as Frozone.<br /><br />THE INCREDIBLES contains a great deal of action and some mild violence. As Helen/Elastigirl tells her children before she sets off to rescue Dad, the bad guys here aren't like the bad guys on television, the bad guys here will kill kids if they get a chance. Like FINDING NEMO before it, THE INCREDIBLES is an amazing story of family love. It's also a reflection on temperance; finding the balance between what you were made to do and what everyone else in the world wants you to do.<br /><br />THE INCREDIBLES was directed by Brad Bird. Previous to THE INCREDIBLES, Bird was best known for the animated film, THE IRON GIANT. Some of the same ideas dealt with in that movie are also dealt with in THE INCREDIBLES, but in a totally different fashion with a totally different setting and cast of characters. Bird also wrote the screenplay. In the movie there are clear influences from several great action films of the past, including STAR WARS. THE INCREDIBLES also resembles the graphic novel THE WATCHMEN by Alan Moore in some aspects, but in a very family-friendly way.<br /><br />The animated short included with the major feature is entitled BOUND. It's a story told in ballad about a proud sheep who is humbled after his first sheering, but is given a new look on life by a wise jackalope. Thank goodness there are jackalopes.<br /><br />Overall, THE INCREDIBLES is a great family movie. Watch it, then go hug your kids, call your parents, or re-acquaint yourself with that family member you haven't talked to in years.</p></body></html>

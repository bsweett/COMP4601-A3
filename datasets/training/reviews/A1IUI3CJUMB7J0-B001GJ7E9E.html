The chemistry is great between Pitt and Jolie(maybe becouse they are seeing each other in real life). The movie has great one liners from Jolie and Pitt. The action scene's are great and the movie is halarious. i never thought this movie would be as funny as it was. The plot is good everything about this movie is good.</p></body></html>

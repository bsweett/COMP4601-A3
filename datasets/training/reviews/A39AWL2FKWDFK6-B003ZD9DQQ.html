<meta name="summary" content="The crumbling of the Third Reich"></head><body><p>Oliver Hirschbiegel's amazing film "Der Untergang" chronicles the last days of Hitler's Nazi Germany as observed through the naive eyes of his personal secretary Traudl Junge.  Junge played by Romanian born Alexandra Maria Lara was selected by Hitler in 1942 from among a group on young women to serve him against the advice of those close to her.  She remained by his side as the film fast forwards to April 1945 and the underground bunker complex under the Reichchancellery in Berlin.<br /><br />Hitler, played with frightening reality by Bruno Ganz, complete with nervous tics and explosive and frenetic verbal outbursts is still, to the end, trying to maintain a hold on the reins of his dying empire.  He is surrounded by his closest staff most of whom show blind and fanatic allegiance to him.  Cracks, however, are beginning to appear in the resolve of several of his highest ranking ministers and generals.<br /><br />In a wild spew, Ganz vows that he will never allow the Reich to surrender to the Soviet forces that are now encircling Berlin and his compound.  As the end draws closer, many of his devoted followers choose to commit suicide than to live in a world without National Socialism.  This is demonstrated quite disturbingly by Corinna Harfouch playing Magda Goebbels who coolly administers poison to her 5 sleeping children.  Then she and her husband Joseph played by Ulrich Matthes proceed to die by gunshot.<br /><br />While many of Hitler's closest minions are swallowing their guns and shooting those who they consider traitors to their hopeless cause, Eva Braun played convincingly by Juliane Kohler is partying seemingly oblivious to the tragedy unfolding around her.  Finally both she and Hitler commit suicide and even still those remaining vow to continue the fight.<br /><br />Hirschbiegel quashes feelings of sympathy for those players in this realistic drama evoked by virtue of the naivete of Junge.  She is filmed in present day saying that even though she was unaware of the atrocities committed by the Nazis, it was lax on her part to not have been more observent and tuned into their genocidal policies.<br /><br />"Der Untergang" proves to be a stark and realistic portrayal of what really happened in that bunker in the waning days of World War 2.  Director Hirschbiegel accurately captured both the fanaticism and hopelessness of that situation in his film.  My only criticism is that the film was a bit too long and better film editing might have eliminated the tendency for it to drag at times.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Passable as entertainment, flunks at history"></head><body><p>Let's begin by saying that as entertainment, this movie is passable (albeit, just barely). The scene of the battle in the ice is certainly one of the most exciting scenes shown in movies during that year. As for the actors, most of them lack charisma in their roles, except for Keira Knightley as an improbable celtic warrior. Clive Owen, specially, is totally devoid of charisma in the lead role (though he has proven he is a fine actor in other movies). OK, now let's turn to history. This movie was promoted when it was released as the true historical portrait of King Arthur (someone who, most likely, never existed), so it's fair to question this aspect of the movie. According to this film, Arthur was a Roman general who, by the time of the withdrawal of the Roman troops from the British Isles in the 5th century, decided to join the Celtic locals against the Germanic invaders and eventually become their king. Well, where one can start? With Arthur's warriors shown as improbable proto Russians? With its anachronic portrayal of the Catholic Church, already more powerful than the Roman empire and engaging in the inquisition (an invention from the late middle ages)?. With its laughable references to historical figures like Bishop Germanius and the heretic writer Pelagius? If you want to see an entertaining movie, you might enjoy this film, but if you have some interest in the history of the period, you are bound to came out very disappointed.</p></body></html>

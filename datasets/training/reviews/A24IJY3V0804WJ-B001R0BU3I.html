<meta name="summary" content="One of the few notable movies on terrorism"></head><body><p>Okay the movie is good. I do not know why I neglected watching the movie after having it for such a long time in my list. Don Cheadle gives a good performance, Guy Pierce acts well. A movie about terrorism and you get the mandatory foreign locations, the villains and some America bashing. I recommend it, if you like a fast paced movie experience. It is also a different take on terrorism after the influx of these movies after 9/11.</p></body></html>

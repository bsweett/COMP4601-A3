<meta name="summary" content="Not up to snuff with the first two movies but still fine entry."></head><body><p>Years after Terminator 2, John Conner (Nick Stahals) is a loner for his mother was presumed dead when she left him later as he matured. However he is still having bad dreams about judgment day even from the stuff his mother told him years ago as now The Terminator (Arnold Schwartzenegger) is back as he's reprogamed to protect John Conner yet again and another bad terminator who is a female terminator with the qualities of the first two Terminator villains named T-X (Kristianna Lokken) is set to kill John and future wife Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) so it could set up judgment day including the rise of Skynet.<br /><br />Co-starring Earl Boen who played Dr. Silbermen from the first two movies and David Andrews, this is the weakest installment of the franchise which doesn't have the magic of the first two movies from James Cameron. Miss Lokken is quite sexy as the new villain but is no match for the deadly villains of the first two movies even the T-1000, Jonathan Mostow who directed "Breakdown" and "U-571" is in place of Cameron for this installment does offer some good action sequences and decent acting but it's quite flawed even with some of the corny humor thrown in. It's nowhere as good as the first two movies but still a fun entry including the new one.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Special Edition DVD has great extras like audio commentaries, interviews, trailer, featurettes, an HBO making-of documentary, intro by Arnold, gag reel, build your own action sequence feature, storyboards, datebase files on characters including history of the film franchise, deleted but funny Sgt. Candy scene and of course behind the scenes of the T3 video game.</p></body></html>

Since then, I went back and watched; Predator, Predator 2, and Alien, Aliens, Alien 3. They were all fantastic. Then I watched Alien vs. Predator and I found it lacking.<br /><br />Compared to the others, the movie seemed childish. It has to be a little childish if it's rated PG-13. You know something isn't right if every Predator/Alien movie before this is rated R and this was knocked down to be a PG-13 film.<br /><br />The acting was pretty lame in this movie with the only noticeable star being Lance Henriksen, which is a fantastic choice because he is a wonderful actor, it's especially great considering he was in both Aliens and Alien 3 and it's nice to see an old face we all know. But even he could not help the film. Everyone else is a bunch of nobodies, and after seeing this movie, looks to stay that way.<br /><br />The story had its share of problems as well. The number one problem being that the movie is set in 2004. What a horrible choice to set a movie in. At least it still felt right to have Predator 2 in 1997. But 2004 just felt too early a time to have this taking place. Is Bishop Wayland, played by actor Lance Henriksen, the ancestor of the human Bishop that designed the androids on Alien 3? It has to be since Alien 3 is set at least 54 years from now. Certainly not 2004. I was never really clear on that.<br /><br />I did, however, like the storyline of how in the past humans would breed aliens as a human sacrifice so the Predators could begin their hunt. I also liked how they showed it in the past as the Predators were being overthrown and would self destruct. Very well done scene, the chest buster skeletons looked great and gave a good intro for that story.<br /><br />The bond the Predator shared with the human at the end of the film was very interesting and obviously a tribute to the comic book series which occasionally showed the two species working together.<br /><br />Now to the look of the film. The map to the pyramid that was on the Predator's arm reminded me a lot of the Hive map used in the lack luster movie Resident Evil that Mr. Paul directed as well. This which isn't a good thing and has me wondering if we will see maps like this in future movies he is involved with. I have to give it to them; the Aliens in the movie looked fantastic, very sleek and well designed. I give them props for that. Predator looked great as well, but bulkier. They looked so bulky, it look as if they didn't have a neck, nothing like the look of the Predators in the first and second film. But when the Predator took of his mask, the detail was astounding. He looked fantastic. The face just seems to look better and better with each new film.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about it being set in Antarctica was the Predator must have been freezing. I know once it wasn't covered in ice, but it's been established in the first two films that Predators prefer hot/humid environments. They must have been shaking in their boots and very uncomfortable.<br /><br />The battle sequences were great, every single one of them. If nothing else is good in this movie, the action is. It was nice to see the return of the Predator's weapons as well.<br /><br />Overall, as a movie by itself, it's decent. When compared to the other movies, they are all far superior to Alien vs. Predator. This movie reeks of what could have been with the scent of a good movie. So I can see why people like this movie with the great action scenes and fantastic monsters. But I can also see why long time fans like my self don't care for it. The acting is horrible and the story of them going to Antarctica to look for an ancient temple is kind of dumb. Like I said, I liked the ancient scenes. So I'm torn; when they make another movie, we need a better story, and a better director. Resident Evil: Apocalypse was better than this.</p></body></html>

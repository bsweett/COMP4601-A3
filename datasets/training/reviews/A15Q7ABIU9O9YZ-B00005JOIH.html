<meta name="summary" content="There are always 'hard men' to do what is asked to keep the beast outside the gate"></head><body><p>I still get a lump in my throat and my eyes well up when I hear the words of Jim McKay: "They're all gone." If we are to believe in a global look then we must be wary of all hate and prejudice, whether in Africa or Eastern Europe, because this is the malignant plant that it breeds.<br /><br />So these 11 runners and hurdlers and wrestlers come to Munich for the Olympiad in 1972, and are murdered. What to do?<br /><br />Golda Meir didn't coin the phrase, but as contrasted with negotiation and talk, she enacts the (what is now) unconventional attitude of 'hunt them, find them, kill them'<br /><br />And so a team led by Eric Bana begins just that, seeking the men responsible for the atrocity. The murderers were PLO, the infamous Black September group, and as history tells us eventually 9 of 11 were assassinated.<br /><br />What Spielberg does is clearly avoided by revenge and retribution authors and directors from "Shane" onward. In those tales the hero is left lonely but victorious over evil. Here, we get to reflect upon the terrible toll of retribution.<br /><br />To kill someone, even under the aegis of right, costs a lot. Just read the bio of Dick Winters in "Beyond Band of Brothers" to feel the palpable injury still shouldered by the remaining men of Easy Company, 60 years later.<br /><br />This picture is brilliant. It may not be your cup of tea. But the amazing thing about it is how different people have different reactions. The very actions of Madame Meir may be an affront to you. But I submit that it is not a choice so much between killing and living. It becomes a choice between decision and indecision. She decides to act in a certain way. Avner (Bana) accepts the offer reluctantly, grows into it, finds himself double and triple teamed by it, and eventually suffers the consequences of his decisions.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as Avner's team's handler, manipulative as management, seeing different goals, embracing different agendas. You have the feeling that for all of their cunning and intellect, the Israelis are as riddled with conflict between the government, the Mossad and purpose as we are in the United States. This is clearly a keeper and along with Ryan, Schindler, and BOB, Spielberg remains one of the top 3 or 4 directors in America unafraid of embracing the hot potato.<br /><br />After navigating the catacombs of ethical issues, one of the film's characters utters "there is no peace at the end of this." True. Is it brilliant? I think so. You may not but you ought to see it. Larry Scantlebury. 5 stars.</p></body></html>

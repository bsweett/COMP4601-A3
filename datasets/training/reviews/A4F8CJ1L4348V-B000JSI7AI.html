<meta name="summary" content="A story of two men in love"></head><body><p>Now it is my turn to chime in. I orginally saw this movie in the theaters with my partner. The movie theater was packed with all people both straight and gay. There was not an eye that dry when the movie was over. I liked this movie for what it is and what it stands for. It is a story about about two men that find each other in the early 60s and fall in love. If everyone remembers what the early 60s were like for people of color, and everyone that  was a different faith than Christian. This was not a time of safety for anyone that was different from the white Christian hetrosexual family. With that being said, Jack and Enis did what they had to at the time the movie took place for the safety of themselves and their families. I find it very interesting what people are saying about this movie and why they don't like it. All that they are talking about is how these two men in love cheated on their wives. I ask myself, can these reviewers see the trees through the forest? Or better yet, can they see past their own noses (the reviewers) and walk in these men's shoes in that era being who they were? No, they would not have the strength to be who they were in those times. I am a person that came out in the 80s, into a society that was not accepting of me or my partner. I can only imagine what it was like in the 60s where everyone was hated for being different than a white hetrosexual Christian male. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see pure strength and a fearlessness for who they love.</p></body></html>

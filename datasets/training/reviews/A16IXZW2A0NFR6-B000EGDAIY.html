It is a very boring uninspired remake with lackluster acting, zero story, a few moody camera shots that were done much better in Ju-on. This is very much the definition of what sucks in American Cinema today, lets take an overall good foreign film, redo it with an American cast, squeeze out any out the chills and originality and make it a nice boring safe flick for the kiddies.<br /><br />PG-13 is destroying the horror film!<br /><br />Don't buy this tripe don't even watch it unless you're twelve.<br /><br />Watch Ju-on, a genuine horror film with some sincere scares, not this sanitized butt wipe version.</p></body></html>

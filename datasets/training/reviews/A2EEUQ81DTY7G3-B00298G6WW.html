Never before have I seen an actor fit a role so perfectly here. He absolutely shines in one of the most darkly sexy performances to come along in recent years.<br /><br />As the hedonistic Mr. Noble, Brosnan travels the world eliminating people for unseen corporate interests, whiling away the hours between jobs by fornicating with whores, underage girls - and probably a few men - whilst also gulping down huge quantities of liquor and occasionally puffing on a cigar or two.<br /><br />While on a job in Mexico City he meets the naive businessman Danny Knight (Greg Kinnear) who has been fighting a loosing streak - he's still reeling from the loss of his son and now he's about to lose a lucrative business contract to a Mexican competitor. To add insult to injury, his house was partly destroyed by a falling tree just as he and his loving wife Bean (Hope Davis) were about to spend some passionate time together.<br /><br />It's Julian's birthday so he wants to celebrate and suddenly lonely spies Danny in a hotel bar. After Julian shocks Danny with an irreverent comment about Mexico, margaritas and a certain male appendage - one of the best lines in the film - the couple strikes up an uneasy friendship.<br /><br />Danny's deal grows problematical, forcing him to stay on a few days, so Julian takes Danny under his wing and takes him on a trip to a bullfight and into his confidence where he talks about the nobility of death and reveals that his occupation is a "facilitator of fatalities." Of course, it's is only a matter of time before he requests Danny's help as a co-facilitator. The problem, however, is that Julian is having a midlife crisis.<br /><br />Not only is Julian questioning his chosen profession, he's also just screwed up an important assignment because he's having problems pulling the trigger. The big guys are after him, and he's now become used goods. Frightened for his life, he turns to Danny - and by association Bean - who have become his only friends and ironically his salvation.<br /><br />Matador gets most of its comic mileage out of the ferociously irreverent script and the strange and unlikely friendship, the type of witty byplay that develops between Julian and Danny. Pretty early on it's established that both are diametric opposites, but in reality are they that different from each other? Julian is the cool, suave and confident sleaze and Danny is the Boy Scout who always plays by the rules - the hook is that there's a part of him that is fascinated with Julian's lifestyle.<br /><br />All three of the major players - Davis, Kinnear and Brosnan are absolutely terrific. Brosnan, who's looks physically better the older he gets, stages a full-scale assault on his image. He not only walks across a hotel lobby wearing nothing but a Speedo and cowboy boots, he shows that he can play crude and mean it. It's a skillful real tour de force comic feat and a real pleasure to watch.<br /><br />The movie also makes the most out of some exotic locales - Manila, Budapest and Vienna, and of course Mexico City, which adds to the riddle and sense of mystery that contributes to Julian's transient existence. Richard Shepard obviously has a flair for dark comedy and the irreverent side of life, and he really persuades us to gradually bond with these strangely enigmatic characters, which by the film's end have become the unlikeliest of soul mates.

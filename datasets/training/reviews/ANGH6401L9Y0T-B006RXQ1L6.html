Who cares if the plot is downright stupid? I'd give it five stars if it was just a little more clearly understood to be humor, but murder is such an un-funny thing.<br /><br />Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a dancer who had an act with her sister until she found her sister and her lover in bed together and shot them both. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a girl in the chorus who had an affair with a furniture dealer because he claimed he could get her a job in a swank nightclub. When she discovered he was lying and he laughed at her, she shot him, then tried to get her auto mechanic husband to take the blame.<br /><br />They met in prison where the matron, Mama Morton (Queen Latifah) is doing quite a business in selling favors of various kinds, and apparently collecting them, too. She recommends Roxie see defense attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who has never lost a case. Turns out he's Velma's attorney, too.<br /><br />That's the outline of the story, and of course we have a courtroom scene. But what is slightly disorienting is that people burst into song and dance all the time, everywhere. Might make you think of Jailhouse Rock or Cry Baby. Still, as I say, the dancing is red hot, as is the jazz, and the costumes are mostly very small and sparkly. All in all, it's a lot of fun, and makes me think again about the fashion dolls Robert Tonner made from the main characters. If I had the money . . . but of course I do not.</p></body></html>

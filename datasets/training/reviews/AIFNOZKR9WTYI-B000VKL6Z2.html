You see, Michael Meyers, like most autistics, finds himself lost in a world he never made.  A world populated by frighteningly vulgar and loud neurotypicals who encroach relentlessly, victimizing him until he lashes out with great and fiery vengeance, laying waste to the sordid humanoids around him in a blistering blaze of white heat.  The sister's boyfriend who got put down with an alunimum bat was particularly deserving of this fate, by the way.  Just before getting his head beaten in, you see him fashioning a sandwich from noisesome cold cuts.  He's the type of person who has absolutely no personality whatsoever, apart from a basic sloppiness of demeanor and a shaggy mane of hair that is in the process of fusing into white dreads.  Such a pity his early demise.  The world has lost so very much.<br /><br />Michael then is unjustly incarcerated just for being a freedom fighter.  His mother can't take how great he is, and so she blows her brainz out.  Whatta shame.  So then Michael lays waste to some worthless hillbillies and busts right out of the mental hooskow, leading the resident psychiatrist and stereotypical liberal to bleat "ooohh... oooh!"<br /><br />Flash forward to later that night.  More people need Michael to give them a proper seeing to, which he does, very autistically.  You see, the man behind the mask is the perfect metaphor for autism.  The sense of disconnect and alienation, the sense of needing shelter... add in the fact that the original Meyers mask was adapted from a rubber mask of Captain Kirk (William Shatner interpretation) and we've come full circle.  Stick a knife in this one.  It's well done.  Rob Zombie learned from his mistakes in his first two movies and turned out an excellent movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Let's go to the drive in!"></head><body><p>When I was younger (much younger) there was a movie venue in America called the "drive in."  Folks pulled up in cars, attached speakers to their windows, and watched movies on a large wall set in an enormous field. In my day, the drive in had two uses. One: it was a place where you took a girl on a date because you were too young  to have your own apartment and not worldly enough to get a hotel room. When used like this, you and your date simply steamed up the windows in your old man's car, and it didn't matter what the movie was. The other purpose of the drive in was to go with a gang of your friends (with one usually stuffed in the trunk to save the price of one ticket) bringing in as much beer and wine-cooler as you could stuff under the seats. Resident Evil would have made a perfect drive-in movie, and frankly, I loved it. <p>The gore was well done, barrowing from Alien, John Carpenter's The Thing, and Night of the Living Dead. Milla Jovovich is a pleasure to look at, scampering through the whole affair in a miniskirt, and she displayed a real flair for action as well. Finally, there is just enough good story and plotting to keep you brain at least idling. <p>Nope, it's not Citizen Kane, but then sometimes that's a good thing. It was directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, who always brings a certain integrity to all his work, and at the least this is a carefully crafted movie. <p>Back in the day, my friends and I would have talked for hours about this film, and considered it time well spent.</p></body></html>

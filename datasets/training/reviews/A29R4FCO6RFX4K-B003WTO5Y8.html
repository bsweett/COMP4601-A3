Jodie Foster, along with Hopkins, deservedly won an Academy Award for her brilliant performance as FBI agent Clarice Starling. Based on Thomas Harris's novel, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is one of the few thrillers which relies heavily on psychological terror rather than splatter horror and "boo!" scares. But there are some extremely effective shocks and twists during the course of the film. And Howard Shore's dark, brooding score adds to the creepy tone. Although the film's plot centres around tracking down the crazed serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), Hopkins is the standout performance. The clever back-and-forth between Clarice and Lecter is well-played and enthralling, and there are some moving moments with Lecter that add to the film's gravitas. Demme's hard-edged direction won him an Oscar, and the film picked up the Best Film Award also. What does this tell you? Well, that SILENCE is the most superbly-constucted thriller ever made.</p></body></html>

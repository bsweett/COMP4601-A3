The thing that left me confused is why exactly the priest was on trial. I don't think that was fully explained. They were holding him responsible for Emily's death but wasn't it her family that put him in charge? He didn't ask for that position. And then he used his faith based methods to try and help her (DUH! He's a PRIEST!) and then they wanted to throw him in prison when it didn't work. That didn't make sense to me.<br /><br />I was very let down by the DVD extras. I really wanted to learn more about what REALLY happened. I know everything they showed happening to Emily was totally made up for the sake of the movie but how much of the trial was reality based? It left me frustrated that it didn't answer those questions.</p></body></html>

As I look back, I have enjoyed all of his films.  Part of that, I guess, is that I am willing to take each film for what it presents to me rather than putting preconditions on what I want it to be.  I am willing to let Shyamalan tell me his story the way he wants to tell it.  This is especially true of this film.<br /><br />Apparently, it is based on a bedtime story that Shyamalan would tell his children.  It certainly has that flavor about it.  And it doesn't have anything like a driving plot or a great mystery about it.  It is flavored more like a dream.  There are elements that one isn't quite sure what they are or how they relate - even after the film is over.  However, the telling of the story provides its own satisfactions.  The real point of the film is about saving the lives of an apartment complex full of lost souls.  Well, saving at least most of them.<br /><br />How those lives are saved and what that will mean is partly told in the film and partly left up to you to look in yourself and supply to the story.  Which is why the story is so satisfying and why kids like bedtime stories.  It also has to do with why dreams can be so especially satisfying even though they make no logical sense.  It is about connecting things within yourself.  The stories goal is to draw certain things out of you and let you put them together.<br /><br />Maybe you will hate this story.  I have read some things expressing dislike to outright contempt.  It was much better than I expected, but I came to it without expectations or preconditions.<br /><br />The cast is terrific.  I am a huge fan of Paul Giamatti and find his acting compelling and engaging.  It is quite interesting to learn how this guy came to be a stammering and  And I fell for Bryce Dallas Howard in "The Village" and she is just as engaging here in an utterly different character.  Bob Balaban is also a very nice presence in this story as he always is.  There are many other nice actors who contribute to this very interesting story.<br /><br />If you come at this film in the right way I think you will enjoy it.</p></body></html>

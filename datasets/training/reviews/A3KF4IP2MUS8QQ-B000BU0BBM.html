<meta name="summary" content="This is one seriously weird movie"></head><body><p>Every so often, a movie comes along that seemingly defies any and all explanations.  Let's face facts; the concept of this whole story is just plain weird.  Here's the pitch: you know those two brothers who wrote all the children's fairy tales?  Well, we want to take these two guys and turn them into con men going around saving villages from "ghosts," "demons," and the like.  Then, we'll have, oh, let's say the French army, maybe, take them into custody, threaten to kill them, and then send them out to this Germanic village where kids keep disappearing into the forest.  Oh, and we'll throw little scenes of fairy tales in there at random moments - of course, it won't make a whole lot of sense, but we just can't pass up the opportunity to throw Little Red Riding Hood into the mix somewhere.  I'm telling you, man, this baby is going to be huge - that's why we need eighty million dollars to bring this utterly ridiculous story to life.<br /><br />I have to ask: did anyone actually believe this oddity of a film could possibly pay for itself at the box office?  The whole movie was just one ridiculous thing after another.  It's strange, though - the weak plot actually becomes a strength of sorts, as it keeps you on the lookout for whatever twisted fairy tale concept they could possibly throw in the mix next.  I almost hate to admit it (and I certainly don't understand it), but The Brothers Grimm was actually fairly entertaining - largely thanks to Heath Ledger and Matt Damon.  I had no idea this was even Matt Damon until I looked at the credits following the film.  I usually don't care for the guy, so the filmmakers did a great job making him hard to recognize.  The script itself is rather ridiculous; I don't see how anyone inside a film production company could have taken this project seriously.  Someone did, though, and secured a huge budget right along with it.  The money wasn't wasted, as most of the special effects are more than acceptable, but that's just a huge amount of money to spend on a moderately entertaining film destined to have audiences laughing at it as often as they laugh along with it.<br /><br />I must say that they definitely got one thing right in the movie, though.  A mere gust of wind is enough to send a large party of French soldiers into a panic-stricken retreat.  That one satisfying moment isn't enough to make up for all of the time we have to spend with prissy, arrogant Frenchman as the story plods along, but it's by far the most memorable scene for yours truly.  Overall, I would have to give The Brothers Grimm 3.5 stars (which I have to round down to 3).  This could have been a pretty impressive film, but the necessary focus and vision just never came together.  The Brothers Grimm is good for a few laughs, and that's about it.</p></body></html>

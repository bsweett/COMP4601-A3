<meta name="summary" content="NOT AS BAD"></head><body><p>I did not expect much from this film because I don't like the cast much, and the story is also not within the purview of my own interests. Usually I avoid things with stories that don't have much redeeming value to me personally, but in this case, I thought I might as well watch. The DVD fell into my hands, and I figured it could not hurt. I can say I was impressed with the film... grand scale, interesting... but overall, it seemed a bit much. This is why I just think it was average or a bit above average. The grand scale in essence was too over the top for my liking, but I did find myself entertained and engaged in the story enough to stick with it through the whole length. It was gory, bloody and dramatic, also not my favorites, but I think the film is worth seeing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="UNFAIRLY OVERANALYZED"></head><body><p>Come now, it's not as bad a film as many reviewers lament! With just a minor clipping of subthreads that lead nowhere, or a somewhat less cacophonic background score, it might even have made for a 4-star action thriller.<br /><br />The plot is awash with twists and tension, but the music hoses us with sounds that swell at all the wrong moments, least necessary of which are those when our supercop steps out of vehicles in slow motion. Such gratuitous effects reek of B-grade.<br /><br />The script falls squarely in not-bad territory. Our adolescent and thus inadvertent hostage takers do well with what they are given, but one of them has to personify half-baked psychopathic undertones while the other two wade in sporadic brotherhood. Characters such as the female superintendent of police, or a baritoned and masked bad guy, come across as little more than stereotypical caricatures. Plus, I would really have liked to feel for Bruce Willis' family.<br /><br />To fan the fire, literally, the last half hour swoons with convenient developments that defy logic at many levels.<br /><br />But all that is probably par for the course with lollipop thrillers so it shouldn't hurt. I had a fairly good time. If you suspend disbelief and watch it without 'Die Hard' expectations, it should make for a pretty gripping suspense flick.</p></body></html>

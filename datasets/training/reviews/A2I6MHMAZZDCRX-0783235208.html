<meta name="summary" content="What a Thrill Ride!"></head><body><p>In ancient Egypt, one priest had the nerve to fall in love with Pharaoh's mistress.  As a penalty, he was cursed to become one of the undead and suffer for all time.  Unless someone released him from his prison.<br /><br />Flash forward to the 1920's.  A group of treasure hunters and a group of archeologists set out to find the ancient city of Hamunaptra.  When they accidentally awaken the ancient evil, they find themselves in a race against time to save their own skin and the world in general.  Is there a way to stop someone you can't kill?<br /><br />This movie starts out rather slow.  The first hour is set up getting the characters to the city.  Once the Mummy awakens, however, it becomes a fast paced thrill ride you can't stop watching.  The actors do a great job of keeping things believable, even if the plot has a few holes in it.<br /><br />The DVD truly has some great stuff on it.  Not only do you get great picture and sound with wide screen and full surround, but you get some fun features, too.  The director's audio commentary is fascinating, discussing the struggles that it took to get the movie to the screen.  Along those lines, the documentary is fantastic as well.  I always love seeing what goes into making movie magic.  Also worth checking out is the section on ancient Egypt.<br /><br />This movie is slightly horror, but mainly action/adventure.  It's a Saturday matinee, popcorn flick with great special effects.  Pop it in and enjoy.</p></body></html>

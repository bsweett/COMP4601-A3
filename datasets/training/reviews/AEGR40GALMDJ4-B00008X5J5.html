<meta name="summary" content="One of the more unique Disney films."></head><body><p>Following in the hard to fill footsteps of Cinderella and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Sleeping Beauty is totally and completely detached from the way typical Disney fairy tales are told.  The movie has more of a storybook feel to it than it's predecessors.  The art style is completely original, it resembles a medevil/gothic approach.  The characters are wonderful, and the evil fairy Malificent is one of the most creative and evil of all the Disney villains.  The music is very good and addictive and it whisks you away to another world.  It is a once upon a dream.  See it if you love Disney films.</p></body></html>

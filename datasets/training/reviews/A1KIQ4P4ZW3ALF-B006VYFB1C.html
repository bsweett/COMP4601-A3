<meta name="summary" content="Beauty in a Desert"></head><body><p>Anyone can sell a horror, a rom-com, a fantasy or an epic storyline to a captured audience. Not that hard. But, by way of metaphor, it takes a creative mind to look at a desert of what to most of us is a seemingly endless sand and see hidden beauty and then guide the rest of us in how to also find beauty in a desert. Thus, the back room machinations of baseball are not normally likely to wake even a snail from it's slumber (let alone most of us humans) yet Pitt crafted this tale so well that even the snails in my yard were unwaveringly intrigued by this story. Snails vote five stars.<br /><br />On rather insignificant minor notes: First, "The Show" sung by Dorsey in the movie was around 2002 but wasn't written/released by Lenka until 2008/2009. My second minor note is the interpretation of the metaphor at the end of the movie. First, Beane says "I made one decision in my life based on money. And, I swore I would never do it again." Which is actually a form of rigid thinking that the premise of the movie argues against. One poor decision doesn't imprison you to all subsequent decisions of that type. Then the metaphor comes in, "You're doing it for what the money says. That you're worth it." "He hit a home run and didn't even realize it." All suggest to me that Beane's thinking out of the box worked and all that the money does is confirm it. So he should have gone to where the support was (in all it's forms).</p></body></html>

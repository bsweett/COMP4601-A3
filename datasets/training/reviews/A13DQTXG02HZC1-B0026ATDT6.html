It's critically acclaimed and also well received by audience world-wide.  The local newspaper stressed us to watch the movie before it's butchered by Hollywood.  So, I did just that.  Perhaps, I went to the cinema with over the top expectation and reality never managed to match that.  Yes, I gave credit to where it's due.  This movie came about because of one actual incident that happened in South Korea where poisonous pollutants were dumped into the Han River.  In other words, The Host was actually not an entertainment movie per say but a protest movie.  Surprise, surprise, the media & the Americans were branded as "villains" of the movie for building up a paranoia akin to the SARS virus that broke up in Asia few years ago and also of the Americans endeavouring to cover up the "problem" that it triggered at the first place, which was rather similar to Hollywood version of Godzilla storyline.  The Host was patchy at best and there were funny moments too.  Having said that, the focal point of the movie was a simple Korean Park family that simply went around living their own lives until they were interrupted by this monster that was a metaphor for the intervening factor in Korea.  Nobody would take heed of the ordeal & believed what they had to say about their missing family member until they had to resort to one another for support.  Don't expect a linear progression of storyline where the monster would be slain and everybody would live happily ever after.  The special effects was mediocre and critics specified that it's to pay homage to B-grade movies.  It's entirely up to audience to decipher what's real and what's deliberate.  Otherwise, a watchable movie.</p></body></html>

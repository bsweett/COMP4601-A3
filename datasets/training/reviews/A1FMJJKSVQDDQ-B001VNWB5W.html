The only good things about this are the fantastic action and visuals. The fascinating character of Rorschach is also a welcome addition. But sadly, everything else doesn't add up. The characters aren't fully fleshed out (even the flashbacks aren't enough). The script needed some improvements (there were some silly dialogue here and there). Malin Akerman and Matthew Goode were horrible in this movie (couldn't they have at least tried?). Of course, it's just my opinion. It's fine my me if you love Watchmen. But to me, this didn't keep me interested. I give it a D instead of an F, mainly because of Rorschach and the special effects.</p></body></html>

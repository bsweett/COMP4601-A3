<meta name="summary" content="Bring your rain gear!"></head><body><p>This is an excellent movie in the tradition of Stewart Granger, Tyrone Power, Errol Flynn and Robert Taylor. What with all of the extraordinary technology director Peter Weir hurls at us, it would be difficult to subscribe a 50's feel to it. Nevertheless it has that larger than life feel to it not uncommon in some of those earlier "epic" works.<p>Crowe is a larger than life actor, and fits well into the garb of Captain "Lucky" Jack Aubrey, Captain of HMS Surprise. His orders - to shadow and destroy the enormous French warship, the Acheron. Captain Aubrey's friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin, equally well played by Paul Bettany, is a formidable advocate for compassion as Crowe is for leadership.<p>The Surprise steals the show, and 10 minutes after the movie begins we forget we are on the pitching deck of a 200 foot frigate in the South Atlantic.<p>Jolly good show. Makes movie goers want to see more period pieces and book readers read more of Patrick O'Brian. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

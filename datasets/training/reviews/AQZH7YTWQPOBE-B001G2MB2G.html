<meta name="summary" content="Ministry of Magic goes mad"></head><body><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7F5SS">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a> is another great installment in the Harry Potter series (and, in my opinion, much better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PMV9FG">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Widescreen Edition)</a>). It features the internal dissension in the wizard world between those fear Lord Voldemort versus the bureaucrats who fear losing power. Imelda Staunton as the Ministry of Magic bureaucrat Prof. Umbridge plays her part well. Often funny, always perky, she steals the movie. She has a great soundtrack theme as well. Nicholas Hooper's theme for Prof. Umbridge is a perfect mix of control-freak and 1950s female streotype.<br /><br />I took off one star because, as a movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7F5SS">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a> can't stand alone. It tells the story of the book well enough. However, at the end of the day, it seems too transitional, too much a gap-filler between the return of Voldemort and the final battle. It never really develops into a compelling enough story in its own right. If you're not a Harry Potter fan, this movie won't hook you onto the series. If you like the other Harry Potter movies, I think you'll like this one.</p></body></html>

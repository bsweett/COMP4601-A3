The following year Farrell showed up in a slew of box-office big names like `S.W.A.T.', `Daredevil' and `The Recruit', and he showed surprising depth of character development in the underrated and underseen `Phone Booth'.  It was 2004 though, that was to bring him into the big leagues; sort of.  In 2004, at least in the beginning of the year, he was on the top of everyone's Oscar predictions for he was starring in two very controversial and highly anticipated films.  There was the independent `A Home at the End of the World' and the Oliver Stone epic `Alexander.  Sadly, both films failed, and while Farrell showed some strength in `Alexander' (I loathed his turn in `A Home at the End of the World') it wasn't nearly enough strength to stand out come Oscar time.  Since that fateful year it seems as if Farrell's star has faded.<br /><br />This brings us to 2008; to be more exact, it brings us to a whole new Farrell.<br /><br />I had all but given up on Farrell as being a serious actor and actually utilizing the talent I saw in `Phone Booth' when I happened to stumble onto a series of reviews for this little film.  I had read raves calling this Farrell's finest performance to date and so the fact that it was a gangster film (of sorts) and took place in Europe (with accompanying accents) and co-starred Ralph Fiennes all factored into me deciding to give it a shot.<br /><br />Let me just say this now; one of the best films of the year, easily.<br /><br />`In Bruges' tells the story of two hitmen, Ken and Ray.  Ken is older and wiser than Ray.  He possesses a certain calmness that comes from confidence and a level of comfort.  Ray is young and green, which leads way to fleeting spells of panic and uncertainty.  After Ray botches a job (his first at that) the two of them are sent away to a small medieval town (Bruges) to hide out, lay low, until they receive further orders from their boss Harry.  While in Bruges the two of them go through levels of self discovery that help shape them into the men they truly desire to be.<br /><br />Writer/director Martin McDonagh has marvelously crafted a film that both exciting and intelligent.  It never sacrifices either for the other.  The film is never boring, for it is filled to the brim with action and charisma.  Both lead actors (Farrell and Gleeson) compliment one another flawlessly by playing two opposite ends of the spectrum.  Gleeson embodies Ken with this paternal warmth that helps add layers of humanity to this contract killer, especially as the film progresses and his true relationship with Ray is revealed.  Farrell ditches the paternal warmth for wit and charisma.  His portrayal of Ray is so real and natural.  We believe his faux performance (Ray's performance is faux; Farrell's performance is genuine).  We understand the mask that Ray puts up to hide his own insecurities, and as his past is revealed and his motives are unveiled we crumble for him; and this is only made possible by Farrell's undeniably natural performance.  Not one word spoken, not one movement made, not one moment of this performance is sour.<br /><br />Honestly, so far it's the best performance I've seen this year; by anyone.<br /><br />`In Bruges' tackles with grace and a fair amount of bloodshed the subjects of loyalty, friendship, morals and ultimately; atonement.  This is proof that genre films of this nature (the whole gangster, murder, hitman type genre) don't have to be riddled with plot holes and littered with poor acting.  `In Bruges' is brilliantly written and expertly executed.  It is not only thought provoking and haunting, but it is witty, charming and quotable (this film is filled to the brim with memorable lines).  The acting is marvelous (look also to Ralph Fiennes who has a nasty turn as Harry, as well as Clemence Poesy who serves as Farrell's love interest Chloe) and McDonagh's direction is spot on perfection, taking in the serenity of the city without losing the intensity of the situation.  This is a hit on every level that will satisfy any and every film enthusiast.</p></body></html>

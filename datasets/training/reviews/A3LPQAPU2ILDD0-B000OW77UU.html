Not the greatest movie, a little slow at times, but Will and young Jaden Smith make for one of the best duels of the year. Thandie Newton very believably plays the haggard and stressed wife and mother. Great acting ensemble all around.<br /><br />The kid definitely has a future ahead of him should he pursue it. Will Smith is very convincing in his characterized climb from the bottom to the top. Probably his best work to date.<br /><br />It's never too late to achieve our dreams!</p></body></html>

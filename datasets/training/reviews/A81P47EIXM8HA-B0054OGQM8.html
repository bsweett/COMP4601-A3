<meta name="summary" content="Is this a game of OPERATION or a blu ray set?"></head><body><p>My goodness....what a disaster...I've about destroyed my set and still don't have all the blu rays free from their plastic prisons!<br /><br />The first disc, which was freed with loads of help and luck and broken plastic....looks absolutely what blu ray is supposed to look like...spectacular..... and I always like the Universal Blu ray menus.. but good lord the packaging is easily a 5 star deduction from what would be a 5 star plus set based on content....<br /><br />I don't know how to get the attention of Universal other than to put up poor reviews for their edification. And please...before you give me an Unhelpful vote...these reviews are not just for the movies but how they are presented, packaged, and priced and for 50bucks plus we should not be wrestling with and damaging our dvds!  thanks!</p></body></html>

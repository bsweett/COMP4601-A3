<meta name="summary" content="Intense.  Very Good."></head><body><p>"The Grey" is a suspenseful film that I recommend thoroughly.  It' very intense; by no means is it a date movie.  Indeed, it was unexpectedly good.<br /><br />The movie involves a very dramatic plane crash somewhere in Alaska or northern Canada in the depth of winter.  I might add that the crash itself is brilliantly crafted.  Top film making!  There are a handful of survivors and if the crash wasn't bad enough, they now have to contend with ravenous wolves.<br /><br />It would be wrong of me to reveal any further details as to the ultimate outcome.  However, I can say that the terror of this Arctic wasteland really is frightening.  Liam Neeson plays the de facto leader of the group.  He has clear experience with the landscape and wolves; he was employed by the oil company for which they all worked as a wolf hunter.  But now he has no weapons and has to rely upon ingenuity and cunning.  He rises to the occasion.<br /><br />Although this film has had none of the publicity of the various Oscar nominees, it is still well worth seeing.  Just don't expect a happy story about furry animals.</p></body></html>

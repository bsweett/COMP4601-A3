<meta name="summary" content="Star Wars"></head><body><p>Star Wars plots are inconsequential. Only nerds, dorks and geeks know them. It is the characters we remember: Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Obi-Wan, C3PO, R2D2 and Chewbacca. George Lucas could have done the world a favor and let Darth Vader die at the end of A New Hope. I was 31 in 1977 and, although I thought the film was okay, I was not swept away like the kids. I thought much of the dialogue was stiff and unemotional. Carrie Fisher has little if any charisma. My favorite is Obi-Wan. He is the one with perseverance, the one who waits years to set things right.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Remember John Carpenter and learn!"></head><body><p>I've watched this movie since I was a kid. I watched it a million times, over and over. I love it, I adore it. I think this movie made me search for John Carpenter's masterpieces. I have the dvd and I love it. It's one of the very best movies ever made. It's a very exciting horror movie. Special effects for it's time are amazing. Even nowadays with all these CGI and everything, this movie shows how it should be done. Not every movie with the best graphics and set of actors can compare to it. Wish it had more features and was released on blue ray. But it's awesome as it is.</p></body></html>

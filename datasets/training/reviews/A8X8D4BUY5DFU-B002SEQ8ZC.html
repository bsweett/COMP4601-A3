<meta name="summary" content="Typical Great Tim Burton Fantasy"></head><body><p>I ordered the 2d version based on ratings and I was not disappointed . I got a 2 sided disc with 2d and 3d versions. the 2d was more colorful and sharper. I watched the 3d version for several minutes. I got some of the 3d effect but the color was so dull that it was boring, and The vision was still uncomfortable after 10 minutes. Current 3D is not worth it to me.<br />The movie was great. I liked the story line, the animation, the dialogue, and the voices. Suitable for all ages and interesting for adults.</p></body></html>

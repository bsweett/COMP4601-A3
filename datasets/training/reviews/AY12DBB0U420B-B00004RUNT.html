<meta name="summary" content="Unmitigated Drivel, but  Fun to Watch."></head><body><p>I first discovered Bruce Willis in the TV show "Moonlighting" in the later 80s. I just didn't watch much TV, but this was a show I'd tune in on for the sly, droll humor. Beyond this show, I lost track of Willis, although I know he starred in movie after movie because I'd see the ads. Alas, I seldom go to movies. In any case, I'm now viewing deep discount DVDs as late night entertainment. I purchase most of the DVDs at a nearby Ross Store, and I came across "The Fifth Element" DVD with Bruce Willis and decided it was worth a viewing.<br /><br />Well, this is one of those science fiction/absolute fantasy movies. The story is so incredibly unreal and improbable that I'm just unable to follow it. Want me to appraise the plot? Complete unmitigated drivel! Now, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the movie, Quite the contrary, I enjoyed it on a different level. I'm really impressed as to how this awesome movie was put together. Amazing! Willis stars as a taxi driver in a three-dimentional futuristic New York City. It's hard to explain. You have  to see it. Even though it's well in the future, there's still smoking and, evidently, McDonalds is still thriving. Oh, and the NYC garbage problem hasn't gone away. Well, Willis ends up in a space-age encounter and romance with an orange-haired Wonder Woman space alien and they have a surrealistic adventure.<br /><br />The movie is just amazing. No expenses were spared on the sets, the special effects were awesome and it has a cast of thousands. Who cares about the plot? The visuals are excellent and the sound is good. Bruce Willis is, well, Bruce Willis and the entire movie is infused with a droll humor even including visual puns. It's fun to watch. Violence is rampant and hundreds die in a variety of creative and spectacular ways. Even  without a plausible story, it held my attention.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Most Holy and Timeless Python"></head><body><p>"Monty Python and the Holy Grail" would have to rank as one of Python's high points and came to be almost an icon of the group's zany humour. My first viewing of the movie left me at once choking for oxygen and impressed by some of the subtle angles they took. Admittedly, not that much was all that subtle in the end.<br /><br />Containing great scenes that still endure as massively quotable, (even non-Python fans have heard of them), this is definitely a must-have for anyone remotely interested in the work of Monty Python. The black knight at the bridge is still one of the funniest things I have seen, (I still kill myself laughing at it). The "anarcho-syndicalist" serfs, ("You can't expect to weild supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!" -- Dennis to King Arthur), were just a treat. Overall, it is a good whipping at anything concerning King Arthur and a host of other tales from the medieval period.<br /><br />Simply put, this is among the best that Monty Python have done, and after over 30 years, it is still up there with the best comedy on the planet. I loved it back then, and I still love it now. An enduring classic that never bores. Great stuff that definitely needs oxygen and defibrillation units.</p></body></html>

It has set the standard for years for detective movies, but its dark atmosphere, fantastic script, and gripping tension have never really been achieved (possibly The Big Sleep, another Humphrey Bogart mystery, comes close) since. <p>The plot is rather complicated, and to explain it in detail would be to give away the point of the movie. Still, the movie mainly deals with two elements: one is a seemingly innocent girl whose appeal for help to Sam Spade (Humphery Bogart) and his partner leads to several mysterious murders, and the other is the web of crime relating to the priceless Maltese Falcon. As the movie progresses, the relation between the two elements becomes clearer and clearer...but to say anymore would be to spoil too much! <p>But even though the plot is very interesting and thrilling, what really makes this film special is the atmosphere, the script, and the acting. The black-and-white cinematography is great, and the scenes, which are kept shadowy, give the movie a chilling, dark atmosphere - it really is a film noir. <p>The script is fantastic, and Humphery Bogart brings the wisecracking, tough Sam Spade to life. He is the perfect incarnation of the streetwise, cunning detective - always ready to fight, but smart enough to not have not do so very often. In another of Humphery Bogart's films, The Big Sleep, in which he plays a similar character, a girl tells Bogart that he is not very tall. His response is typical, and is the epitome of his attitude - yes, he admits, I'm not very tall, but "I try to be," he explains. His comment says it all: he is not tall, but he projects a fantastic tough guy image nonetheless. Anyhow, his performance is wonderful - it is his quintessential role! <p>The other actors, especially the girl he deals with, are good as well. All in all, this is a must-see film - and it is OK for the whole family, although it may be a little hard to follow for younger children. I don't know how else to recommend this...get it soon!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="sin city"></head><body><p>An all-star cast in one of the best films ever made. You have to be high to not like this film. It has 3 or four stories that are not hard to follow at all. The action is hardcore and the ladies of Old Town are capital H-O-T. One thing I love is the black and white of the film and how only certain things are in color. Like a red dress, golden hair, blue eyes, and so forth. Just certain features of people and places are in color, which is really cool. Sin City is one of those films that will never get boring or forgotten.</p></body></html>

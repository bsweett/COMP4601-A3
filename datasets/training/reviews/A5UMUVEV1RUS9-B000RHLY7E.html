<meta name="summary" content="Even creepier than "House of 1000 Corpses""></head><body><p>And in my opinion, I think it's even better than 1000 Corpses. 1000 Corpses has a Texas Chainsaw-feel to it. The Devil's Rejects has that nostalgic-feel of low budget 70's horror films. Creepy and chilling, it's more shocking than scary in the sense you won't be checking your closet for Captain Spalding once you're done watching, though if you've never feared clowns before, you probably will after you see this. It's disturbing and will satiate your cravings for horror. I wouldn't recommend watching it alone, but if you like this genre, especially if you can appreciate the older movies from this genre, I definitely recommend The Devil's Rejects. If you saw 1000 Corpses, you shouldn't miss this one from Rob Zombie. I think it's even better than 1000 Corpses.</p></body></html>

While volume one was decent, volume two scenes drag on and on. The 2 Kill Bill movies could have easily been edited down to a 2 1/2 hour running time, but Tarantino decided to make one of the grandest exercises in self indulgence I have ever seen.  Volume two plays like an outtake/deleted scene featurette on a DVD.  Most of the scenes are useless, and they go way too long.  Critics gushed all over this, claiming it was full of real emotion, and that Quentin had matured as a filmmaker. They couldn't be more wrong. This is a film by a man who knows about movies, but not about real life. Tarantino grew up watching crappy Kung Fu films, sleazy European trash films, and bad Jack Hill films. And the influence (and the blatant ripping off) of them permeates his work.  If you need to watch a 4 hour film, Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, or Once Upon a Time in America are available. One frame from any of these films is superior to Kill Bill.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still Disturbing!"></head><body><p>The King, or should I say, Queen of horror movies. Still as potent today as when I watched it in a theater in 1973.<br /><br />Very doubtful they could make this film today as it is, & get an R rating. Not in this political correctness age. NC 17, just for the masturbation with a crucifix & then Regan pushing her mothers face to her vagina saying, "lick me!" Then there would probably be groups protesting the movie by the dozens. "The Exorcist exists the way it is because of a grandfather clause, from a time more permissive in Cinema.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks & sounds great! The movie never looking or sounding better. There is grain in the film, but that is more to how it was filmed & it's age, than anything technological of today.<br /><br />Highly recommend the upgrade!<br /><br />5 Stars = Masterpiece</p></body></html>

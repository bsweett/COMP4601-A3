<meta name="summary" content="Wildly unpredictable, but enjoyable thriller."></head><body><p>Critics of this movie have a point -- this story writes its own rules of logic and cause and effect.  If you don't accept its premise, then you will probably ridicule every twist and turn in the story.<br /><br />I accepted the premise, though, and though not all the pieces work, the resultant story was so unpredictable and unusual that I found myself quite engrossed.  I was in fact surprised that this film was directed by the writers of Final Destination 2, which I disliked.  But this time, I found myself drawn into this world of parallel realities and possibilities drawn up by directors/writers Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber.  Where Final Destination 2 was all shock tactics and gratuitous gore set pieces, The Butterfly Effect does its job much more by playing with your expectations and sympathies.<br /><br />The performances are fine, with Ashton Kutcher doing a good job playing college psych major Evan, whose memory blanks out at key points in his life, leaving black holes he must fill in for himself.  The character is basically a god-like figure with the ability to change the realities of everybody around him by manipulating his own decisions.  This alone makes for a fascinating character motivation -- not quite complete altruism, but a mad dash to save the people he loves.  Melora Walters, Elden Henson and William Lee Scott tackle multiple roles with good results, and central figure Amy Smart has never looked dreamier, giving a solid emotional motivation for Evan's character.  The switching of roles and characters is an oft-used TV device, but it's done with enough aplomb and variety here to make the exercise highly entertaining.<br /><br />If I have one grudge, it's the pacing.  The first act of the film lurches forward jarringly (though not without reason), and scenes are often a little too short.  As a result, it's a little hard to accept when the central conceit first happens; it's like we were set up for a psychological thriller and then the filmmakers cheated us into a supernatural solution.  Still, it was somewhat fun to be completely disoriented by the "what the blazes?" middle of the film, and after the initial lurches, the narrative moves forward quite nicely.<br /><br />Say what you will about this film, but you can't say it doesn't take risks.  And the script is smart enough to ground its very far-fetched premise with enough setups, payoffs, catharsis and danger that even if you don't buy the conceit, you probably won't be bored.  Me, I enjoyed this film greatly and would recommend it highly.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The movie that started the golden age"></head><body><p>We all must realize that had this movie flopped, it is possible that there would not have been a "Spiderman", "Daredevil", or the terrific-looking (at least from the previews) "X2".  While many comic fans are rejoicing that the future looks great for this type of picture, there had to be a tremendous amount of pressure to do it right.  After years of seeing substandard products, due to a combination of lack of special effects technology or Hollywood indifference, the folks at Marvel waited many years for the right time to put together exactly the right movie.  <p>After living with these characters for many years and having it firmly in my mind what they should look like, I can say that there could not have been a better job of casting.  Patrick Stewart was born to play Professor X.  Getting a actor of Ian McKellen's status for Magneto was a real coup.  Hugh Jackman gives the best performance in the highly desired role of Wolverine.  Who knew then that Halle Berry would become the second Oscar-winning actress in the cast (along with Anna Paquin)?  And who also knew then that Rebecca Romjin-Stammos would become arguably modeldom's hottest pin-up?<p>All these people were cast by others that knew the characters inside and out, and wanted the best product possible.  Like "Spiderman", there are very few changes to the "rules" of the characters, and anything done different (like ditching the familiar costumes) was done without harming a thing.  Watching it again is getting me really pumped up for the sequel.</p></body></html>

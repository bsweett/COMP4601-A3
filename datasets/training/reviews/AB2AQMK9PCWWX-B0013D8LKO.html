Could it be that they're supposed to make you question things about life, trust, love, sex, marriage, the American Dream? Despite the pacing, this will have you--if  you are in any sense thoughtful, or introspective--wondering a lot of  things, in the film and in life. Stunning from frame one, it never  relinquishes it's tight hold on the senses of the viewer.  But that's why  it's an misunderstood masterwork. It draws you in and teases like an  impressionist painting.  You get too close to it, you begin to see flaws.  Things never are totally what they appear to be, nothing's ever all good or  all bad, black or white, I mean, can you really trust what you think you  see? Is the image of the good life, the good life? We all do kinda take  things for face value, that's for sure.  And movies are reflective of some  of our overall views. But movies are colored light images projected on a  screen, right? Real or unreal?<p>EWS messed with one's mind on several  levels--did you accept rich man's Sydney Pollack's explanation of the  mansion's going's on? Plenty of Freudian slips and verbal faux pas,  there--evil incarnate, there. Did Nicole have an affair with the naval  officer (even in thought) or not? Was Tom's (although we want to side with  the integrity of the main character) answer's to Nicole's questions--ie, he  never once felt enticed by a female patients body even in the clinical  setting--completely honest? Will men ever be as honest as women? Will women  ever be as dishonest as men? Or are they equally prone to being  corrupted/corruptible/incorrigible? Were you perplexed as to how  provocative those &quot;blue lust shots&quot; of Nicole with her naval  officer were--even if they were taken for the cinema, Tom &amp; Nicole are  married in real life and it must've been quite a surreal experience having  to go through it, for all parties involved. Notice how Kubrick's use of  color punctuated certain passions...particularly red. Almost like an Ingmar  Bergman film.<p>There are little nuances in Kidman's acting (take a look at  &quot;To Die For&quot; and &quot;Malice&quot;, by the way) that makes one  believes that she &quot;knew&quot; of Tom's goings on at the mansion,  (hell, she may have even been one of the masked sex slaves), at the  hooker's apartment, even when he is confronted at Pollack's--she didn't  have to be told, but the fact that Tom DID tell, however, sets well with  the American filmgoer's desire for a linear, &quot;and they lived happily  ever after&quot; story... at last, we want to believe our certain accepted  notions will never be challenged. But they are, and they always are...and,  sadly, most of us would rather keep our eyes wide shut to these  challenges...<p>For those of us who don't mind the challenge, the questions  and the debates, this provocative film is gonna be in our mental libraries  for years to come...</p></body></html>

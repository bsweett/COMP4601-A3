<meta name="summary" content="Haley is every victim's HERO!"></head><body><p>Ellen Page has just made herself a new fan with this movie. It's very rare that you find a movie where you find yourself rooting for the main character the whole time. The only complaint I have is that it did start off kind of boring for about the first 20 minutes when the film just shows them chatting online, and then meeting, and hanging out for a while. However, the fun starts after she drugs him after telling him "Never drink anything you didn't mix yourself" he didn't listen so he woke up tied to a chair. Again, I think that Haley is the hero of every little girl who has been targeted, taken advantage of, stalked, of preyed upon by a pedophile. On the Internet or otherwise. Jeff got everything he deserved, and then some. Don't get me started on the casteration scene...THAT WAS CLASSIC! I had to watch it again just to see him beg. To make this review short, I think you'll really like this movie. It probably become a cult classic later, but for now I think it's one of those films that fell through the cracks.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cool movie paying homage to 70's horror."></head><body><p>This movies has a real mood that hits dead on the mood and style of 70's horror flicks (much like Cabin Fever) although it doesn't really do much other than use certain camera techniques and a psychic woman it does it pretty well.  The Creeper is a very cool creature, and the arguing brother and sister aren't really a common set of main characters in other movies, so they help with the believibility of the story.  The story pretty much revolves around two siblings trying to get away from a monster guy who drives a really sweet (yet durty and old) truck and tries to eat them.  The whole point is that he likes to scare people and that's why he doesn't kill them at first.  He only is awake for 23 days every 23 years (I own the movie and I'm not for sure on that though).  There are some pretty cool scenes that add a little suspense and some locations that add to the overall creepy (no pun intended) mood of the story.  Victor Salva, who has an interesting past that I won't go into, does not focuse as much on blood and gore as he could, but goes more for suspense and scares, which is cool since we get enough gore in this day and age.  I think horror fans should go for this, but I'm not sure if the casual moviegoer will enjoy this.  They might not understand it's purpose.</p></body></html>

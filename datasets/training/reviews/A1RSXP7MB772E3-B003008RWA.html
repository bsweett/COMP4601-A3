It is of course very revealing of a subject that would otherwise be unbroadcasted to us. CNN and MSN never reported of the criminal acts until Micheal Moore did. And it makes me so angry to hear of other countries who laugh at us, while we writh in our impossible mud hole of a health care system. It doesn't take this movie to tell people that our system is from hell, so what purpose does it serve other than to create a buzz? Well, I think it's important that people here know it's country wide, and that perhaps we could learn from some success stories elsewhere. As a movie, it's funny as hell, but it will put a tear in your eye as it's F***ing sad. We need to change our system. People need to ask themselves why the hell we put up with it? Are we so lazy and indifferent? Are we so scared? Well, Micheal has always been best at making people question their old belief's. My Republican boss says she will never give her money to Micheal, she even became angry when I brought it up. I can't believe this is a red and blue thing. Maybe, in that way, it's bad that Micheal directed this movie. He carries with him such political baggage. But there isn't anyone else and it's more important for this movie to be made.</p></body></html>

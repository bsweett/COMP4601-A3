<meta name="summary" content="Great and not so great"></head><body><p>I went into this movie not expecting much. Most recent Disney movies have sucked. I was very surprised by the quality of the animation in this film. They put some serious effort into the background scenery, the water flowing, the lighting, ect. Many of those shots are worthy of framing. I did not like the character style, however. It reminded me of my daughter's Barbie movies and was very un-Disneylike when compared to the classics. Not bad, but not what I have grown to love.<br /><br />The story moved along fairly well with nothing terribly unexpected happening. My biggest disappointment was the music. A great Disney movie uses the music to set the theme for the movie and the music moves the story along. With a few notes you can pick out the theme songs of Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, or even the Rescuers. I can't remember a single song from this forgettable score and I just saw it yesterday. I got the impression the songs were stuck in there because all animated Disney  movies have songs, and not because they actually cared what the songs were.<br /><br />In the end, my daughter loved this movie and my wife enjoyed it. So it is better than the component parts. I will probably buy it, which is more than I can say for most Disney movies of the last few years, but it will not be a favorite.</p></body></html>

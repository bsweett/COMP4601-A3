<meta name="summary" content="Catchy title but mediocre movie"></head><body><p>It certainly is a very disturbing story as we watch 4 young Columbian women being used as "mules" to deliver cocaine to the US, but unfortunately this film made "mules" out the characters, failing to really develop any of them sufficently enough to carry this flimsy plot.<br /><br />The movie starts out well enough, introducing us to Maria and giving us a glimpse of her life in the outskirts of Bogota, but the film breaks down once she and her compatriots board the plane to New Jersey. It was hard enough for me to imagine Maria getting through US customs with her weak story much less surviving this harrowing ordeal.  The director all too obviously sets up each girl as a stereotype for what happens to young women caught in this predicament, and then loses all sight of what he is trying to say as Maria and her friend are left to fend for themselves in New York.<br /><br />This was obviously a director who felt he had something terribly important to tell, but his inabilility to sufficiently resolve the plot is what brings this movie down.  Too bad because one does develop empathy for Catalina Sandino Moreno, the actress who played Maria, as she managed to keep her head held high throughout this movie.</p></body></html>

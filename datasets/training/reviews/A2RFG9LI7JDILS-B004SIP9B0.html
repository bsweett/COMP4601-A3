<meta name="summary" content="great movie about the queen and her dilemma.."></head><body><p>Helen mirren gives a great performance as many have already stated.. What i find the most interesting is the tension between the classes in great britain.. On the one hand the country is so very modern.. on the other hand it feels like it is still clinging to the last remnants of tradition..  At the center of this lies elizabeth who must reconcile her private concerns for upholding her dignified historical position with her realization that things are changing... As much as i detest people who are handed everything in life.. mirren's deeply felt performance makes the queen's position very real and identifiable.. while i will never feel sorry for the aristocracy in any shape or form (yes it exists in the u.s. to they just call it something other than aristocracy) i can still find their position very interesting to examine.. and that is precisely what this movie does.</p></body></html>

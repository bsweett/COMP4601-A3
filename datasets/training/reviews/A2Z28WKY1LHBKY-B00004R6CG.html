It surely isn't down to the plot, which is one of the goofiest and most unbelievable ever filmed. Gumshoes are often presented as pretty stupid guys who don't really know what they're doing, but Stewart comes across as just about the dumbest, most naive and amateurish detective who ever lived. You mean he took on this ridiculous assignment, tracking Novak all over the place, without doing any checking on his client, the background to this crazy set-up, or even seeing a photograph of the mentally challenged wife? Where was she anyway all this time? OK, Hitchcock was never strong on convincing stories, and we are told he didn't give a hoot about believability. That isn't what his films were about: apparently what he was doing was playing on the audience's emotions as if he was a kind of Wurlitzer-meister. OK. So it still doesn't explain what the ravers see in this film. Here's a suggestion. This is a woman's picture, and it is devised to explain to women why men don't love them, or why both parties wind up disappointed in each other. Men are in love with some kind of remembered fantasy of the perfect woman, which no real woman can ever be. This fantasy is probably their mother, who is barred to them anyway (except in the case of Oedipus, just like Freud said). Barbara Bel Geddes, who looks like a really nice real person, keeps calling herself Stewart's mother. He can't take this; which is why he's a grey-haired aging bachelor who lives alone. (Actually, he's supposed to be the same age as Bel Geddes). Novak looks like a cream cake, good enough to eat, especially for a small boy. Trouble is, too many cream cakes make you feel sick. Novak knows this, but she has low self-esteem, so she plays along with Stewart's fantasy, hoping it will work out after the marriage. It never does, of course. So is this what the critics recognize as so great about this story? I wouldn't know. The narrative is slow, true, but bearable if you're feeling relaxed. The acting by Stewart and Bel Geddes I thought was good. Novak was playing an amateur actress anyway, so she was OK. Some of the shots were pretty memorable. The dirty double-dealing husband sounded English to me; and that figures, in an American film. Well, I'm still puzzled. No 4 in the hall of fame? I don't get it. Three stars.<br /><br />November 2006. Eureka. Now I begin to get it. This is after watching it several times in an effort to understand why it gets so many votes. And I've also been greatly helped by a discussion on the Imdb website. However, nobody on this site has put forward what seems to me the convincing theory which is at last emerging, based on the many plot holes and flaws in the story, which is otherwise being praised for its beauty, scenery, acting and so forth.<br /><br />It is often said that just before his death a man's entire life flashes before him in his mind. Not that I know how anybody knows this, but it's a persistent folk-belief. Its application here is that what we are seeing is the inside of Jimmy Stewart's mind during the split-seconds between the moment that his police buddy falls to his death, and the moment Stewart himself also crashes to his own death on the street below.<br /><br />One of the nagging flaws in the story, as told, is that we are never shown just how Stewart got rescued from where he was hanging from the rooftop gutter. Was he actually rescued at all? If he was rescued, why is he wearing a corset? Did he break his back from falling? How could he have survived falling from such a height?<br /><br />Second flaw. The whole story is entirely goofy. The murderer's plot is so complicated and insane, it couldn't possibly have been planned with any hope of succeeding --- if it had been real.<br /><br />Third flaw. How did Kim/Carlotta do her disappearing act in the old hotel? Was the little old desk lady in on the trick? Why wasn't this explained?<br /><br />Fourth flaw: Are we seriously being asked to believe that Kim/Carlotta and Kim/the shopgirl in green can't easily be recognized as the same person? And how did Kim/Carlotta come up with all that brilliantly improvised dialogue when playing her part as Carlotta?<br /><br />Fifth flaw. Where did the nun come from? And there are others. Why is the couple sometimes shown driving on the left-hand side of the road? What about that strange backdoor entrance to the flower-shop ? With no way for Stewart to pass the other car? And so on.<br /><br />Finally: why does Stewart make that strange gesture with his arms in the final shot of the film, when he is shown as if from the top of the tower, looking down at Novak's body?<br /><br />The solution would be that that is the moment when he dies, both emotionally and physically, and is lying as a crumpled corpse on the street. The whole sequence of events consists of things that are going through his mind, dredged from his past, as he is clutching at straws but actually falling to his death. The story is a rip-off of Ambrose Bierce's brilliant short story, An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, also made into a brilliant film, where we experience the thoughts of a man about to be hanged. Time and again through the film, Stewart is pleading for a second chance, for survival, for release from his sense of guilt, from his hallucinations and bewilderment. But the answer is that it is too late. He has let his hands slip from the guttering, which has probably broken anyway.<br /><br />As a poet once wrote: We do not die of death, we die of vertigo.<br /><br />But I can't change the stars when I edit my review. I'd add an extra star, if I could, but it's still not 5.  It's a rip-off. See also the Lee Marvin film, Point Blank.</p></body></html>

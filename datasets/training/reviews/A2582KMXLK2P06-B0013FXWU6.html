<meta name="summary" content="not really bloody"></head><body><p>I'm a *little* disappointed with There Will Be Blood. I was led to believe it was a dark horror film, but it's anything but. The pace is identical to a slow-moving western, and the storyline isn't what I expected either. The ending is absolutely terrible too.<br /><br />I DO like moments of the storyline because it focuses on one mans greed and the consequences and inner torment he constantly feels as a result of thinking only about himself and the money he makes concerning oil. This is good stuff. The storyline surrounding his son is pretty good too.<br /><br />A good portion of the beginning is oddly quiet with eerie violin strings playing for several minutes, making it appear like a good horror film is about to kick in... but no, it's not anything like a horror film.  In fact for a while I was wondering if anybody would actually SPEAK!<br /><br />Actually the violins are REALLY good throughout the movie, always giving you the feeling something ominous is about to take place such as a brutal killing scene or one of the characters completely snapping suddenly... no, doesn't ever happen.<br /><br />And where's the BLOOD? There really isn't any.<br /><br />It's basically a twisted drama when it comes down to it. One thing about the storyline that bugged me is the way the time period would suddenly jump forward several years with only a short time for the viewers to prepare for it. It felt a bit rushed as a result.<br /><br />Overall, the movie kept my attention of course, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered giving it 4 out of 5 stars. It's fairly enticing, though moments of the storyline seem a bit flawed and uninteresting for it to have received so much attention from movie lovers at one point.</p></body></html>

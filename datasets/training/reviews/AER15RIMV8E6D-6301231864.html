<meta name="summary" content="THE ULTIMATE ZOMBIE CLASSIC!!!"></head><body><p>This is the Godfather of Zombie films! It's been 40 years since George A. Romero directed this classic, and all these years later, we still enjoy it! The storyline is awesome! The gore is awesome! It has the classic look and feel of the late 60's. On a dark night, the dead come back to life and feast on the flesh of the living. Barbra and her brother, Johnny are attacked, but Barbra makes it to a seemingly abandoned farmhouse to take refuge. Other survivors named Ben, Harry, Helen, Tom, and Judy join her, and try to board up the house to stay safe. There is competition between Ben and Harry over who should be the leader. Will these people survive the night of carnage? If you love classic horror and zombies, you'll love NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="EVIDENCE OF THE OLD GLAZZIES..NOTHING UP OUR SLEEVE...NO MAGIC LIL ALEX...A JOB FOR TWO WHO ARE OF JOB AGE...THE POLICE--georgie"></head><body><p>This is a movie!  The acting,directing,lighting,script and music<br />are all superb.  From the very beginning(perhaps the best intro<br />in film?)we see Alex and his Droogs having delicious spiked milk<br />so the 4 of them can indulge in the ultra violence. This movie<br />like other Kubrick movies combines pieces of comedy-drama-musical<br />action and of course HORROR:)  The TIME FRUIT should be in every<br />one's catalog of film and if it is not...WHY?  This is a MASTERPIECE!<br />To see Alex's reign of TERROR to his capture from the police to<br />his being cured/sickness and his recovery are some of the best moments<br />I have ever seen on celluloid.  I have just seen this for the first<br />time and it is easily in my tops for film.  please buy this now!<br />Wait you are still reading?  Stop right now and-you're still reading?<br />Go to add cart or put on wish list but please own this movie for<br />in time it will own you........<br /><br />WELL-WELL,WELL,WELL.....WELL,WELL,WELL,WELL  IF IT ISN'T LITTLE<br />ALEX...LONG TIME NO VIDDY DROOG,HOW GOES_______Dim</p></body></html>

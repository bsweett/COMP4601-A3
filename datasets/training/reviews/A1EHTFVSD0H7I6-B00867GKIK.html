<meta name="summary" content="Great Idea, But...."></head><body><p>I'm not a die hard fan of animated movies and I usually like them vs. loving them. But I'd heard great things and had lots of folks recommend it as an awesome movie so I went ahead and rented it.<br /><br />My overall thoughts:<br /><br />I like the idea of an animated film about an adult. The story of the man who went on an adventure in his lawn chair has always intrigued me and I loved his simple philosophical reason for his trip, "You can't just sit there." (paraphrased). So this story idea appeals to me. Very much.<br /><br />I loved Russell, the little kid who pesters Mr. Fredericksen and Dug, a speaking dog they find on their adventures. Mr. Fredericksen is extremely spot-on. I've encountered this guy before. Russell and Mr. Fredericksen have a Mr. Wilson and Dennis the Menace type of relationship which wasn't my favorite but as the adventure progressed, so did the relationship, and it ended up being a very, very sweet thing.<br /><br />This film is darker than I thought it might be and I don't see it appealing to any kids I know. For starters the opening takes a long time to get to the current story and I was bored with it. Secondly, it's creepy when they encounter the many scary dog minions and the evil master. Kevin the bird annoyed me and though I understand there had to be something thrown in to make the movie more edge of the seat, it just didn't work for me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Meet the Ultimate Extraterrestrial!!!"></head><body><p>+++++<br /><br />This is a science fiction movie (occurring in the year 2037) that turns into one of horror.<br /><br />The movie begins with the following printout with a spaceship in the background:<br /><br />"Commercial towing [space] vehicle 'The Nostromo'<br /><br />Crew: seven [actually six and a cat]<br /><br />Cargo: refinery processing 20,000,000 tons of mineral ore<br /><br />Course: returning to Earth"<br /><br />After this, there is no talking for about seven minutes as the viewer is shown interior shots of the spaceship.<br /><br />Then, we learn the names of the crew:<br /><br />(1) Commander Dallas (Tom Skerritt)<br /><br />(2) Second in Command, Kane (John Hurt)<br /><br />(3) Third in Command, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver)<br /><br />(4) Navigator Lambert (Veronica Cartwright)<br /><br />(5) Science Officer Ash (Ian Holm)<br /><br />(6) Ship Engineer Parker (Yaphet Kotto)<br /><br />(7) Ship Mechanic Brett (Harry D. Stanton)<br /><br />(8) The cat, Jones<br /><br />The ship's computer "Mother" detects "a transmission of unknown origin" that seems to be a distress signal.  So the ship has automatically changed course to check it out, bringing the ship to a mysterious planet.  Some of the crew check out the signal on the planet and unintentionally bring back an organism.  (It is at this time that the remaining crew onboard learns that the signal is actually a warning signal.)<br /><br />Eventually the science officer says to the others these chilling words:<br /><br />"You still don't know what you're dealing with, do you?  The perfect organism.  Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility."<br /><br />With that said, the crew has to defend itself from this hostile alien organism.<br /><br />This movie has richly detailed sets, an ominous atmosphere, and relentless suspense.  Much of the dialogue is improvised adding to the movie's realism.  The background music adds to each scene.<br /><br />Much of the imagery is unforgettable.  Here are my three favorite images:<br /><br />(1) The alien "facehugger"<br /><br />(2) The alien "chestburster"<br /><br />(3) The frightening and suspenseful conclusion.<br /><br />The DVD released in 1999 has many interesting extras including ten short scenes that didn't make it into the movie.<br /><br />At this point, I should mention that there is another more expensive version of this movie ("The Director's Cut") that was released in 2003 and incorporates some of this 1999 DVD's deleted scenes.  Note that the 2003 version is a minute longer than this (the original, released in theatres) version.  As well, the director said that the original movie released in theaters was "his perfect vision of this film."  Thus, I don't see the point of buying the 2003 version unless you want to spend more money on a few more extras.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  If you've seen this movie at the theatre, this DVD will only enhance your viewing pleasure.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie is truly a landmark of science fiction and horror that can be watched over and over again!!<br /><br />(1979;  1 hr, 56 min;  widescreen; 20 scenes;  rated `R')<br /><br />+++++</p></body></html>

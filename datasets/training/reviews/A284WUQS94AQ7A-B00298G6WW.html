Without his and Greg Kinnear's acting, the film would have died.  Pierce plays a lonely hit man kind of looking for a best friend.  He meets Kinnear in a bar in Mexico while both are there on business and they begin a friendship.  Pierce relates to Kinnear that he is a hit man.  The two then went their own separate ways. Pierce shows up on Kinnear's doorstep 6 years later, only to take him on an incredible journey of helping him make the most critical kill of his life.  Given the plot, I was looking for more of a thriller/suspense but I didn't get it.  It was moving at times, but it dragged on in many scenes.  It is worth watching as the two actors make the whole movie worthwhile, but don't look for the "James Bond" type of suspence and thrill, you won't get it...</p></body></html>

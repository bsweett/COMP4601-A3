<meta name="summary" content=""I'LL TAKE YOU ALL ON!!!" Blu ray review!"></head><body><p>Ok, some of you are wondering why I gave this 5 stars and I will explain. Let's discuss the story. Sam (LaBeouf) is ready to go to college and be a normal guy. It all goes to hell in a handbasket as the Decepticons steal a fragment of the All Spark and revive Megatron! The Autobots ask for Sam's help, who declines. Soon enough, Sam is in trouble as Megatron tries to capture him because he holds the map to where the Matrix of Leadership is kept. During his rescue, Optimus is destroyed and the Autobots are asked to leave the planet by the government. Sam, now feeling responsible goes on a quest to find the Matrix to revive Optimus and learns that they Transformers have been on Earth for millions of years, led by the Fallen. It is this Decepticon that wants the Matrix to destroy the sun and take it's energy for himself!<br /><br />So now, there is way too much camp and comedy. The story lacks continuity. Megan Fox is hot but can't act. Shia is charmingly annoying. Who is the idiot that plays Leo? Skids and Mudflap....oops? Here is why I give it 5 stars! The Transformers themselves! They are the movie! Frank Welker from the cartoon voices Soundwave. Jetfire! There are more Autobots and Decepticons to enjoy! But the real reason for 5 stars....OPTIMUS PRIME!!! For the first time fans get what they've always wanted, Optimus unleashed. He is a force in this movie and basically kicks a$$ and takes names later! For these reasons, I forget everything else. No one will ever confuse Transformers for Casablanca! That's not what these movies are about! Way go Bay and co.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Excellent picture and audio. The picture is so beautiful, which really brings the CGI characters to life. This is a DEMO DISC! SPECIAL FEATURES: All are carried over plus BD extras. FINAL THOUGHTS: UPGRADE!!! A MUST OWN!</p></body></html>

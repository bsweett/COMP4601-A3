<meta name="summary" content="Candid Camera Meets The Gong Show"></head><body><p>As they say, there's a sucker born every minute, but taking BORAT into account, multiply that equation by at least ten.  Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, playing a reporter from Kazakhstan ostensibly in the States to make a documentary, pulls one sadistic prank after another, from sea to shining sea, on unsuspecting folks who subsequently become his comedic accomplices.  The result is funny; hilariously funny; side-splittingly funny.<br /><br />From BORAT's opening sequence from his (fictitious) village in Kazakhstan, this film serves notice that everyone, regardless of politically correct protection, is fair game.  And Cohen also sends the metaphorical shot across the bow that his brand of humor is not for the faint of heart, then promptly backs it up by such ostentatious behavior as bringing his own feces to a formal dinner gathering--to fighting and wrestling with his alleged manager (an obese and very hairy Ken Davitian) along the halls, lobby, and convention room of a packed hotel. . .both men as naked as the day they came into the world.  It's outrageous, it's often disgusting, it's raw and shocking--yet it's also hysterical, as Cohen's shocked bystanders swallow it all, hook, line, and sinker.<br /><br />That's right.  From chasing terrified New Yorkers in central Manhattan to wreaking havoc in a Texas antiques store, BORAT captures people in the act of being themselves.  Most of the time it's not pretty, but it's darn sure funny, and it's 100 percent revealing.  No doubt there's a group of frat youngsters who are still wishing Cohen's camera had never been turned on.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

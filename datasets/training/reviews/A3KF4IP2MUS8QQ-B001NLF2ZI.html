<meta name="summary" content="For once, something actually happens at the UN"></head><body><p>Only liberal Hollywood would cast Sean Penn as - of all things - a Secret Service agent and fulfill his egomaniacal dream of actually standing at the podium of the UN General Assembly.  But I'm going to try and rein in my feelings for Sean Penn and the UN here - although it will take a great show of will for me to pull that off.  Suffice it to say, I had sworn a solemn oath to never, ever watch a Sean Penn movie - and then Nicole Kidman, one of my personal favorites, goes and makes a movie with the guy.  Thus, this was an unusual film for me to sit through - and, as much as I dislike Sean Penn for a myriad of reasons (not just political - the guy did marry Madonna back when I had a teenager's crush on her, after all), he delivers a darn good performance in this movie - he was even better than Nicole.  Were it not for the fact that I have an issue with the ending and the matter of a few plot weaknesses along the way, I might have considered giving The Interpreter 5 stars.<br /><br />It's hard to judge Nicole's performance because I'm not sure if I was supposed to truly like her character.  Silvia Broome (and how ironic is it that Nicole plays a witch and a character named Broome in the same year?) is fairly remote, mysterious, and secretive, and I never really warmed up to her.  This is the first time I've ever not liked or loved a Nicole Kidman character - I even loved her in To Die For, and she wasn't exactly Miss Sweetness in that one.  Here, she plays a UN interpreter who just so happens to overhear a whispered conversation (in a language only she and a handful of other people understand) pointing to an assassination attempt against President Zuwanie of the (nonexistent) African nation of Matoba.  After learning the next day that Zuwanie is planning on addressing the General Assembly in a few days, she reports what she has heard.  Now a lot of summaries tell you that Tobin Keller (Penn) is assigned to protect Silvia, but this is not accurate (not at first, anyway).  Keller's job, as a part of the Secret Service branch overseeing the security of foreign dignitaries, is to protect Zuwanie from the time he enters the US to the time he leaves.  He initially thinks Silvia is lying about the purported assassination attempt.  It's certainly true that she isn't divulging a heck of a lot of relevant information.<br /><br />There are a lot of subplots and gradually revealed secrets throughout this film - and the writer and director earn major kudos for making sure all of it makes sense and doesn't cause great confusion.  In fact, it's all laid out so well that what might be considered surprises toward the end aren't surprising at all.  I wouldn't dream of going into any of the intricate details in my review, though - just know that the story is complex and very well told.<br /><br />There are some definite Hollywood elements to the story, especially in terms of the ins and outs of the UN.  One would hope that UN security is better handled in real life than it is here.  Background checks, people.  Security sweeps really should involve more than someone walking through a room without actually checking anything.  And that safe room - here, it should be called a "well, we might have checked it a week or two ago room."  We all know the UN is corrupt, but it can't possibly be this vulnerable to security breaches.  And why were there any General Assembly microphones on at all when Silvia went back after hours to retrieve her bag?  Of course, all of these things can pretty much be forgiven - this is just a movie, after all.  It's amazing to me that the United Nations allowed Sydney Pollack to shoot a number of scenes in actual UN locations, including the General Assembly and Security Council areas.  The shooting was done on the weekends, but still - why let a brood of movie crew members traipse all over the place?  I wonder if they did background checks on these guys - and whose hands they had to grease to get the OK to film there in the first place.<br /><br />In closing, I'll just say that The Interpreter surprised me - in a good way.  It was a far more intelligent, suspenseful story that I expected, and Sean Penn's presence didn't ruin it at all for me.  That's not to say I plan on watching any other Sean Penn movies, though - not unless he costars with Nicole Kidman, Jodie Foster, or Aishwarya Rai.</p></body></html>

Dashiell Hammett's masterpiece is in the exquisite hands of John Huston and he produces something worthy of any writer's imagination here.  How many insufferable, and stylistically sleek, remakes will we have to put up with until studios realize that reissuing classics is their best entertainment gamble?  The reason that we regard the younger generations as not being able to appreciate films like these is simply because they haven't been exposed to them.  Bogart is sensational and as ambiguous as can be within the larger framework of good versus evil.  From the very first moments of Falcon, just after Miles Archer gets slugged, you fathom that Sam Spade is a most unusual human being and is attached intimately to little around him.  Lorre and Greenstreet are magnificent characters on their own as well.  If I had to chose between The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca the choice would not be an easy one.  Ten stars would be issued if possible.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Steven Spielberg At His Best! Bravo!"></head><body><p>ET - THE EXTRA TERRESTIAL is a timeless and fun movie. This is one of those films you can watch over and over and still feel the emotion. It was acclaimed to bring out the child in us all - but really it is a celebration of who we are.<p>Directed by Steven Spielberg (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Schindler's List), the film real star is not from this planet. Designed by Carlo Rambaldi (Dune, Close Encounters of the Third Kind), this little alien made history by doing the one thing that everyone else on this planet has problems with, making a friend. By making this friend - we as an audience learn about loyalty and love.<p>Standout performance by Henry Thomas (Gangs Of New York, Moby Dick) as Elliot and of course who could forget the screen debut of six-year-old Drew Barrymore (Charlie's Angels I & II, Ever After, Titan AE). Dee Wallace Stone (The Frighteners, Invisible Mom) and Peter Coyote (Sphere, Patch Adams) have some special moments too.<p>The real star is of course ET himself. Although complete made of metal and rubber and operated and controlled by over seventeen people, the little alien could emote volumes of feelings and really didn't say that much throughout the whole film.<p>The DVD extras are the best ever. There is two versions of the film - the original 1982 release and the enhanced 2002 20th Anniversary edition. There is even a separate version of the movie with the musical score performed live with a 200 piece orchestra by John Williams (Star Wars, Raiders Of The Lost Ark) at the actually 2002 world premiere of the Special Edition.<p>There is a 20th Anniversary retrospective and a reunion of all the cast where they talk about the film and its production. There is even a educational section on the planets in our solar system. The DVD is a must for every fan of science fiction and every person who enjoys a movie about love and friendship. I can not say enough about this film. Everyone should have a copy of this one. (11-22-02)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The End?"></head><body><p>Here we have the third installment of Resident Evil. The survivors of the Raccoon City catastrophe travel across the Nevada desert, hoping to make it to a place of safety. Alice (Jovovich) joins the caravan and their fight against the ever-present Umbrella Corp and of course zombies. They are following a note that has them traveling to an infected free zone. After all this is a zombie movie with our heroine played Jovovich doing what she does best. Plenty of zombie fighting action is here and this time in the great outdoors in daylight. She seems able to be able to control hear mental powers a little better now as you would expect, but its use does affect her. Alice seems to be gaining more knowledge about what she is capable of; and I am sure more will be revealed in part four. I do not play the game, so I do not know if this is a progression from it or something the scriptwriters came up with. Oh, you noticed I said part four. Yes, this movie does not look it be the end of a trilogy; I expect another one will be on its way. Now if you are a big Resident evil fan or a fan of B-movies as I am, you will enjoy this. But I would just wait and buy the DVD.</p></body></html>

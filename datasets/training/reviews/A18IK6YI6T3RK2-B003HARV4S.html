<meta name="summary" content="NOT THE PRESTIGE, BUT NOT BAD"></head><body><p>I didn't know quite what to expect from this film..frankly, im not a huge fan of Norton and Jessica Beil is no Meryle Streep, but I was pleasantly surprised with this movie, the pace is good, and Norton is very good, as is Giamatti, whom I always like.  Rufus Sewell is very good as usual playing the villian, he has this flinty quality that really works well in this film.  The twist is very good and i really didnt see it coming.  Highly recomended..though i must advise you to watch the Prestige after this movie..when you see them you will understand why..hint:..The Prestige is much better movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I reject this movie!"></head><body><p>You would think that killing plus Rob Zombie, plus cool music, plus lots of long greasy hair, plus funky clothing and unshowered bodies, plus blood guts and gore would equal a pretty cool movie but in this case, it just equals a stinker!<br /><br />The movie looks cool but it has NO PLOT! Sure, old slasher movies are violent (and had cheesy effects and didn't look as good) but they had more story and they were scary. This movie wasn't scary, suspenseful or eerie, it was just violent and relied so much on shock value that it failed to be shocking after a while. I would tell you fine readers more about the story but there isn't much to tell. Psychotic and sadistic killers go on a killing spree, there is lots of cool music and it's filmed like a music video, the end. Now maybe you won't have to waste your time watching it!<br /><br />I thought the ending fell flat and I just didn't care what happened to any of the characters. I am all for gore and violence but please, Rob (though you are awesome and talented) next time make it have a point! Personally I think Rob Zombie needs to stick to music and leave acting and screenwriting to people who can actually act and write. I might have liked this if it had more 'meat' to the story, I felt something was missing.<br /><br />I know a lot of people liked this movie and I will say it has some visual elements which are pretty cool so I did give it an extra star for ambiance and appearance. It also had a fast pace and that was good. It wasn't my thing but if you like senseless killing, tons of gore and don't care about the lack of story, you might like this.</p></body></html>

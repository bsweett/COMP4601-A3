It has something for everyone.<br /><br />'The Bucket List' features Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman).  These two great actors do not disappoint.  Both Cole (a wealthy curmudgeon) and Chambers (a family oriented auto mechanic) have terminal cancer and are given but a few months to live.<br /><br />This unlikely pair become great friends throughout the movie.  They begin developing a 'bucket list' - items that they have always wanted to do before their deaths.  The roster of 'to do' items includes such things as skydiving, driving race cars, visiting the Great Wall of China, laughing until you cry, and viewing something truly majestic.<br /><br />Due to Cole's unlimited financial resources, they are able to fund their dreams.  They also come to realize what things are really important.<br /><br />There are many funny parts along with the somber ones.  I think it is well worth watching.  I recommend it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Overlong, unoriginal, dull, blah blah blah"></head><body><p>I've never played the video game the movie is based on so I'm only reviewing the movie for what it was. A bunch of marines are called to a research facility on Mars that is accessed from a portal on Earth. When they get there they find that the scientists have been attacked by some kind of creature and are now transforming.<br /><br />Sadly, there is nothing original in this movie. Marines going in to investigate a distress call: check. Special effects monsters: check. Scientists doing secret, ill-advised work: check. Lighting so dark you can't see what's going on: check. Humans transforming into murderous creatures: check.<br /><br />There is nothing here you haven't seen before in a better movie and worst of all it's a pretty dull ride. There is no suspense, no surprises, just one rote scene after another.</p></body></html>

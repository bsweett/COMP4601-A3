<meta name="summary" content="It Moves"></head><body><p>Every year I see countless flicks that pass for entertainment.  I see too many people going to see crap and liking it, but every year I also find something out there that brings back my faith in  talented filmmakers making good movies.  Run LOLA RUN is a really incredible film.  While not preying on petty emotions and cheap plot devices to involve the audience director Tykwer relies on something more important, he gives his film a vitality I rarely see in American film.  This move has a pulse.  We feel it in every seen and then there's that red hair.  I love this movie and  I try to get everyone I know to see it. Don't miss it.</p></body></html>

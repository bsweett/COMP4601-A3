<meta name="summary" content="Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are outstanding"></head><body><p>In Mystic River, director Clint Eastwood has taken the themes of  pain and loss, added superb actors, and a literate script to make a memorable movie.<br /><br />Jimmy, Sean, and Dave were childhood buddies growing up in a working-class neighborhood in Boston.  One day, Dave was lured away and sexually abused by two men.  Years later, Jimmy (Penn) is an ex-con with a loving family, Sean (Bacon) is a cop with marital woes, and Dave (Robbins), forever damaged by his childhood trauma, is barely clinging to reality.  When Jimmy's daughter is murdered, Sean investigates, Jimmy vows vigilante justice, and Dave is a prime suspect.<br /><br />The lead actors are outstanding here.  Penn is utterly convincing as the former thug and grieving father.  Robbins displays his acting chops in the performance of a lifetime, showing a fragile man dealing with such pain that he can no longer function rationally.  The two men certainly deserved their Oscars.<br /><br />This is a movie that will pull at your heartstrings while keeping you guessing who the killer is.  There are, thankfully, no graphic scenes of child abuse or the girl's death, yet you will be on the edge of your seat much of the time.  This is an outstanding film.</p></body></html>

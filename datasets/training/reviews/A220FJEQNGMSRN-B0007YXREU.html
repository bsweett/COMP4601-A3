There are a few good jokes (such as Sean Penn's vision of Saddam's Iraq as a Willy Wonkaland of chocolate rivers and lollipop trees) and it's almost refreshing to see an unashamedly right-wing comedy that picks solely on liberal targets in an age when Bush and co are just too easy targets, but it falls flat as satire by going for only the very softest targets and feels like an SNL sketch that somehow got dragged out to feature length. Indeed, comparison to Superthunderstingcar, the still breathtakingly brilliant 5-minute Dudley Moore and Peter Cook sendup of Thunderbirds from the mid-60s only heightens the film's shortcomings. Even the songs are at best only mildly amusing compared to the relentless comic genius on display in South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut. The production design and sets are quite magnificent, but there's not enough here for a one-off TV show let alone a feature. Forget the politics, this just ain't nearly funny enough.</p></body></html>

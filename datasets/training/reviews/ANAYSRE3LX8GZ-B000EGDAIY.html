<meta name="summary" content="Buffy - The Horror Genre Slayer"></head><body><p>I couldn't wait to watch this movie. I thought the plot was superb. The acting was terrific. And the CGI and FX where the best I've ever seen. The main ghost women looked so realistic. And Buffy looked great. I haven't seen acting so great & terrific since Scooby-Doo. The ghosts in this film are so scary to look at.<br /><br />Now I'll stop being sarcastic and give you the words to decode my review.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to = I unwittingly suffered through this...<br />superb = crap<br />terrific = pathetic<br />best = worst.<br />realistic = s##t house<br />looked great = made me wanna puke as usual.<br />great & terrific = bad<br />Scooby Doo = Debbie Does Dallas<br />are so scary = Are constipated looking dummies that should have been designed to look more like Michael Jackson if they wanted motionless, falling mannequins to look scary.</p></body></html>

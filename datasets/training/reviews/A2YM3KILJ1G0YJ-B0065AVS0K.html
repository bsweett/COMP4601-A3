<meta name="summary" content="Incredibly cinematography, and Jessica Alba at her hottest"></head><body><p>Sin City is a collection of semi-connected scenes for various people in a wild city.  Prostitution, pedophilia, murder, and corruption, it's just like Detroit.  Aside from the plot, the cinematography is stunning.  It's trendy, mostly black-and-white, with emphasis on specific colors to draw attention to ideas or concepts that enhance or benefit the movie.  Whether it's the blue eyes of an "innocent" prostitute, the yellow deformities of a killer, or the kaliedescope of colors indicating confusion and tension, the vivid colors are the tip of an amazingly represented film.<br /><br />The movie starts with the murder of a young woman.  At first it seems pointless, but it's simply a buildup for the chaos to come.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays a detective trying to save a young girl from the grips of an evil pedophiliac.  Unfortunately for Willis, the villain has family connections and an appetite for murder.  It's up to Willis to stop the crime, and save a young child, and evidently, satisfy his urge for genital mutilation.<br /><br />The obvious star of the film is, Merv, the character played by Mickey Roarke.  He's a beast that has hideous facial scars.  He gets his dream woman, his Goldie, who "smells like angles ought'ta smell".  Goldie gets insidiously murdered, and it soon becomes time for Merv to start his streak of revenge.  What follows is a collection humorous, albeit unbelievable, scenes that lead to the true murderer.  Heads in the toilet, torsos used as emergency brakes, faces sent several feet deep into concrete, and axes to the groin, it's only the beginning of the carnage.  Once the cannibalization and nudity starts, the movie really gets into the "plot".<br /><br />Hot women!  Tons of murder and blood!  Religion!  More nut-sack mutilation!<br /><br />Eventually the movie leads to "Old Town", a place where prostitution is rampant - replete with the gratuitous semi-nudity - and the girls dish out their own version of justice.  It's where the entire movie ties in together, and all the scenes slightly relate.  A distorted sense of good's triumph over evil serves as a conclusion to the movie, as an absolute slaughter takes place and "order" is preserved.</p></body></html>

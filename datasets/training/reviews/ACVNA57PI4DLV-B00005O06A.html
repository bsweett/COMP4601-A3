<meta name="summary" content="Greatest movie I have ever seen"></head><body><p>Citizen Kane is considered by many, with Casablanca, to be the best American movie in history. Although I am not an avid movie-goer or a film buff, I can't disagree with that appreciation. It is certainly the greatest movie I have ever seen.<p>Despite being in b/w, Welles' use of light and camera angles is nothing short of stunning, esp. the group scene after the first newsreel. One little problem, though : I don't know if it's because of this recording in particular, but the sound volume grows terribly loud as the movie progresses, so keep your remote in hand.<p>But the most incredible aspect of this movie is without a doubt the story. We follow the quest of a journalist as he is assigned to find out the meaning behind Charles Kane's dying word : &quot;rosebud&quot;. The journalist goes to talk to many people who knew Kane during his life, and gives rise to numerous flashbacks of their contacts with Kane.<p>Despite his never-ending wealth and ambition, Charles Foster Kane is a complex and tortured man. He runs a newspaper empire, attempts to run for governor, and erects a gargantuan castle called &quot;Xanadu&quot;, where he cannot find peace. His apparent paradoxal nature is explained when we understand that what he seeks is love, but on his own terms. He seeks what he does not have.<p>This movie is powerful and asks pointed questions about, for example, the difference between egoism and self-centeredness, and how this affects our view of the world. This is, in a good sense, a very spiritual and involving movie.</p></body></html>

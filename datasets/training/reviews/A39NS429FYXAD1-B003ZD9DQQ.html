<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant Historical Epic"></head><body><p>Deserving of all the praise, this beautifully researched and executed film is a combination war film/docudrama that carefully and responsibly chronicles not only Hitler's final days as the Fuhrer, but the literal demise of the Third Reich as Berlin succombed to the Russian forces.<br /><br />The strengths of this marvelous, important film come not only in the detailed accuracy of its script but in the inspired detail in every department: cinematography, wardrobe, makeup, effects, sound and especially CASTING.  Every part is played to frightening perfection, especially (in my opinion) Speer, Eva Braun, the Goebbels family and, of course Bruno Ganz's amazing depiction of Hitler.<br /><br />The bonus features, while not plentiful, are worthy of the film itself and the director's commentary (in English) especially interesting and insightful.<br /><br />One to own and view in rememberance of the terrible time in our not-so-distant past.  Important not only to remember for the sake of history, but to avoid repeating the mistakes of blindly following a charismatic leader.<br /><br />Nelson Aspen<br />Author, "Sacred Blood"</p></body></html>

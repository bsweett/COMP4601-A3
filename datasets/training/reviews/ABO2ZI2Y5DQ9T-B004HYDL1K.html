<meta name="summary" content="One Great Character Looking for a Better Story"></head><body><p>Based on a character in a fake trailer in "Grindhouse," "Machete" is essentially one short movie expanded into a feature-length action. Danny Trejo plays a former Mexican Federale hired to assassinate a US senator played by Robert De Niro. Machete is a man of few words, deadly with weapons, and he is also a lady's man. This is the prolific actor's first leading role, and though the film is flawed, Danny Trejo is perfect as the vigilante hero.<br /><br />Part homage to exploitation movies, "Machete" is one-joke sketch turned into a 105 minute film. While the thin storyline is the film's obvious weakness, its strength lies in the cast including Jessica Alba, Jeff Fahey, Don Johnson, Lindsay Lohan, Cheech Marin, Michelle Rodriguez and Steven Seagal. With a cast of mostly B-list actors (and former A-listers), violent and sexy "Machete" certainly makes it point in its ultra-gory pre-credit 15 minutes, which is the best (or to some, worst) part of the film.<br /><br />But like most Robert Rodriguez films "Machete" tends to be slack and even dull when it forgets what it sets out to do. We know this is entertainment and we shouldn't take the film seriously, but some actors seem not to see things that way. The subplots about "Sh&eacute;" and Alba's agent (with her not-so-convincing speech) only slow down the film. The confusing climax with so many characters shooting each other is a letdown. The filmmakers need better action choreography.<br /><br />"Machete" belongs to perfectly cast Danny Trejo. I hope he will come back in "Machete Kills" and "Machete Kills Again," but please, next time with a better script.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="New blu ray is good improvement but still issues"></head><body><p>Comparing this new director approved transfer to the old artizan special edition dvd it is a huge step up in sharpness and a lot of scratches and flecks have been removed. However there are some digital artifacts that appear in the first 10 minutes (in particular over arnold head and face when he is having breakfast at home) that are very distracting. Thankfully they do not last. They were not on the artizan transfer at all and neither are they as prevelant on the dvd that comes with this blu ray release (which seems odd because it is the SD version of the new director approved transfer). Anyhow the rest of the film looks good, there are still some soft shots and some smearing here and there but it looks way better. The great commentary from the artizan release has been brought across as well as a new interview with Verhoeven and some making of featurettes.<br /> Dissappointing early scenes but well worth it overall.</p></body></html>

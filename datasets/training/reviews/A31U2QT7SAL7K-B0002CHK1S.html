While Russell's name appears alone in the opening credits, each of the remaining cast members gets sufficient screen time in the claustrophobic tale that combines paranoia, alien invasion, the perils of being secluded, and hopelessness.<br /><br />Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Masur, David Clennon, Charles Hallahan, Joel Polis, T.K. Carter, Richard Dysart, Thomas G. Waites, and Peter Maloney round out the-ten-little-Indians' cast.  Fans of the Agatha Christie novel will understand the comparison.<br /><br />State-of-the-then special effects, a great Ennio Morricone score, an engaging script and great direction from Carpenter make this the most memorable of the three tellings of the original short story.<br /><br />This DVD features both a fascinating 83-minute "making of" documentary and an informative commentary-with-Carpenter-and-Russell version.</p></body></html>

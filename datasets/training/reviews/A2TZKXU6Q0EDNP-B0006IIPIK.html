<meta name="summary" content="Great aesthetics, infantile plot..."></head><body><p>Another classic case of "what it could've been". This film will easily wow you in its opening 10 minutes only to dissapoint you as it progresses. This is ultimately how it will be remembered.<br /><br />"Sky Captain..." is based on 30s-40s aesthetics and 50s sci-fi films and it aims to cash in on the nostalgia factor for the old classics. On a visual level it does extremely well. On an intellectual level it does poorly.<br /><br />  A plot that borders infantile conception cant possibly be compensated by the awe-inspiring visuals, CGIs, and great cinematography in general. The average western viewer has outgrown that.<br /><br />  The old and cliched storyline of an abstract bad guy threatening the world for abstract reasons doesnt wash any more. Not when the good guys are as mindless and simpletonic as the ones portrayed in this film, to the point where a choice as to whom to identify with could be decided through a coin toss.<br /><br />  On top of that, a plot with seriously insulting holes as the one here, only makes for further damage on the film's effectivity, especially when these inconsistencies are eye-poking at best and cant be ignored unless you're someone who could ignore stomping elephants in your living room.<br /><br />  And as for acting...Well...You cant possibly ask for acting when the actors barely have time to utter some trivial line in-between explosions and air-chases. A very competent actor like Jude Law goes pointlessly wasted in this flick. They could've hired anybody for such a low-expectations job and the the dent on people's reputation participating here would be avoided.<br /><br />  But among all this mess, there's the positives that i started of with:<br /><br />  the director has done a truly outstanding job capturing the feeling of 50s sci-fi. The fact that he's done it in a hollow manner is the other side of the coin. But he did do great in that sector. It's not only the clever usage of colour that achieved this, but also the carefully depicted "primitive" technology (seeing the hilarious giant robots will convince you of this. This doubled with some well inspired ideas realised by the CGI makes it an optical feast.<br /><br />  I'd go as far as say that if you watched this with the voice off you'll be alot more rewarded than otherwise. And less cerebrally insulted.<br /><br />  A definitely good try but certainly not worth the cigar.</p></body></html>

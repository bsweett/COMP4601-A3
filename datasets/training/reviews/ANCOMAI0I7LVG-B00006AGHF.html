The idea behind the film was interesting, and the construction (and marvelous direction) keeps the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the films running length.<br /><br />The film tells the story of two men (one down on his luck reformed alcoholic and one successful attorney working on the deal of his career) who are thrust into each others lives through a car accident.  Gavin, the attorney, is on his way to court when he causes a collision of sorts with Doyle.  Doyle is in a hurry too, rushing to get to a different kind of court, the kind where you fight for custody.  Because of the accident, and Gavin's rudeness, Doyle is late and loses custody to his wife.  What is worse, his wife is leaving town with the kids which means that Doyle will barely see them, if at all.  What he soon realizes is that he has something very important in his possession; a file that Gavin left at the scene of the crime that Doyle can now use as a means to get back at him.<br /><br />But that document is too important for Gavin to just give up.<br /><br />`Changing Lanes' has some genre issues, and it certainly loses a little of it's gruff realism to the clich&eacute;s of the genre (it makes some generic decisions that lead it in directions I wasn't hoping for) but in the end the film really pops visually and emotionally, which is needed in character studies like this one.  It also boasts some nicely crafted performances by two men known for their charm and charisma.  While I don't consider either of them `great actors' (well, Jackson WAS superb in the 90's, but he has lost a lot of steam for me as of late), they both turn in excellent work in this film, especially Affleck who may deliver the performance of his career.  He battles Gavin's internal struggle effortlessly, shifting from corporate villain to frustrated `human' with ease and believability.<br /><br />You hate his actions but you are strangely endeared to him.<br /><br />I thought that the character of Doyle was too much of a clich&eacute; to really rally behind.  It isn't to say that Gavin's character was devoid of clich&eacute;s (but, to be honest, it was really his work plot that was the clich&eacute;) but the script was kinder to him.  Doyle's character just melts down into something very predictable, which I wasn't happy with considering the promise he held.<br /><br />Still, Jackson made the most of it.<br /><br />In the end I'm giving this thrill ride a solid B.  Director Roger Michell REALLY understood how to create a bounty of tension, and he draws from his actors to elevate the issues in the script.  If it had a tighter and less conventional script (yes, the idea has flares of originality, but it is woven rather generically) then this could have been a near flawless film.  Instead, it'll have to settle for underseen and undervalued.<br /><br />Watch it.</p></body></html>

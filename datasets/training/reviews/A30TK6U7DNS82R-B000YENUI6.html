The problem here is the script, which is the biggest load of cliches I have run into since the heyday of Constance Bennett and Gilbert Roland in the early 1930s.  Okay, it was sad when the 14 year old girl loses her life in the poverty ward hospital and gives birth to baby Christine, and as we find out her diary tells an awful story, but it turns ludicrously camp after just a few entries.  I'm sorry, but I got the giggles each time the voice-over started moaning about, "Today he addicted me to heroin.  How I wish I had not left my home!"<br /><br />And this kept coming back again and again, I suppose to underline the viciousness of Vincent Kassel and Armin Mueller-Stahl, both of them allowed far too much freedom to make the broadest possible acting choices.  Is it possible that neither knew The Godfather had already been made?  Mueller-Stahl in particular is just slimy evil.  He asks Naomi Watts to dinner and politely asks, "And you have shown Christine's diary to no one?"  What's a girl to do?  I would say, I have sent it to the PO Box of three thousand leading world newspapers and to the BBC.  But instead she just smiles back and says, "Oh, my uncle who has promised to translate it."  "What's his address?" barks Armin Mueller-Stahl.  But in spite of everything, Naomi Watts just does not get it.<br /><br />Vincent Kassel--again, pure evil but with the Fredo twist of being mentally weak and a slave to his own addictions.<br /><br />Viggo--what can I say?  He is in top physical shape and, contrary to the other reviewer, he's got nothing to be ashamed of downstairs.  But yes, after awhile, even in the famous fight scene, you start giggling because he's taken more abuse than Marlon Brando, and he survives everything--and what's more, learns something.  It's Screenwriting 101, as written by DW Griffith.  Lillian Gish MIGHT have been able to make something of that diary voice-over, but don't bet the farm on it.<br /><br />And at the end of the picture, well, there should have been at least 20 minutes more of the movie, but test audiences must have gotten restless at the 90 minute mark, for the movie ends so abruptly I was still munching on my popcorn and anxiously awaiting a save.  Didn't happen.  Daylight.  Eyes blinking in the light.  Ripped off.  Was it Fredo or James Caan?</p></body></html>

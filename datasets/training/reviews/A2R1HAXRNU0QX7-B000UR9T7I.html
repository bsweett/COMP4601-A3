<meta name="summary" content="Great action scenes...but also feels bloated and lazy at times."></head><body><p>Spiderman 3 adheres pretty tightly to the "More is More" theory.  More villains, more subplots, more running time, more special effects, etc.  It is a big, loud "Summer" movie...apparently among the most expensive ever made...and the money shows on screen.<br /><br />It is also an occasionally boring or silly movie.  I realize this is a comic-book movie, but Spiderman 2 gave us enough believable humanity that we now kind of expect this series to present believable humans enduring unbelievable things and reacting in a way that resembles the human race as we know it.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD  (BIG ONES):<br /><br />Spiderman 3 veers back into incredulity.  For example...(this could be spoiler if you haven't seen any previews), Peter becomes infected with some black goop that not only turns his red suit to black...but unleashes his id.  He pulls his hair down over his forehead, resembling the lead singer of The Cure or Fall Out Boy.  That's amusing.  Then he begins to strut around the neighborhood, checking out the girls and buying "stylish" clothes in a scene that looks like it would be a spoof of Saturday Night Fever in a movie like Date Movie.  It's a sketch comedy bit in a bloated Action movie.  It was painfully out of place.<br /><br />There are other moments.  Mary Jane Watson, Peter's beloved, never manages to tell Peter she's lost her Broadway gig.  Granted, their relationship is struggling...but she would have told him at some point.<br /><br />Also, I'm finding it harder to buy all the coincidences.  First, the black goop falls from a meteor that happens to land right where Peter has his moped parked.  Then Flint Marko, the "bad guy" just happens to stumble into a scientific experiment at just the perfect moment to be turned into Sandman.  And then when Peter sheds the black stuff, he manages to drop it right onto his nemesis Brock.  It just stretches my willingness to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />Also, while we're on the "bad" stuff:  James Franco as Peter's friend/enemy Harry is terrible.  When his character gets amnesia, he also becomes a complete goofball.  And when he gets his memory back and is "torn" between helping or hurting Peter...his torment is just laughable.  I know Franco garnered a lot of acclaim in his earlier career...but he pretty much wasted any goodwill I might have had for him.  And frankly, Tobey Maguire looked mostly bored in his role.  I know he's always felt some ambivalence towards his role...but they paid you enough to lose that ambivalence, Tobey.  Get over being filthy rich, successful and a star!  I know it's tough, but suck it up!<br /><br />SPOILERS OVER:<br /><br />On the good side, we have nice performances from Topher Grace, who is alternately amusing and despicable.  Here's an actor who has some spark.  He could be in a league with Ryan Gosling if given the chance.  Think of his work in TRAFFIC.  Thomas Hayden Church does well by Marko/Sandman.  (And our sympathy for him is helped by EXCELLENT special effects for his various transformations.)  Bruce Campbell has a brief but VERY funny cameo as an unctuous French maitre d.  Thanks, Sam Raimi, for continuing to use him!<br /><br />The most important parts of any Spiderman movie are the action sequences, of course, and there are some good ones, alright!  The scene in which Spiderman saves the girl (Bryce Dallas Howard) from the malfunctioning high-rise crane is a blast.  There's real suspense there.  The final scene is over-the-top and exciting...especially as cars, cinderblocks and other debris plunge dangerously close to the imperiled Mary Jane.<br /><br />So I found the movie to be somewhat of a letdown from the psychological and acting standpoint.  The screenplay was just TOO packed...trying to be too many things to too many people.  But you won't complain about the action set-pieces...they are state-of-the-art.  So if you lower your expectations a little...you'll still have fun.  3.5 stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Bucket, Brimming Over, of Life"></head><body><p>Selecting a category for this very fine film results in the all-encompassing label 'mixed media', for lack of a better term.  It is smart (with an excellent script by Justin Zackham), addresses some important social issues, and it has moments of touching tenderness and equal moments of very sold comedy. AND it greatly benefits from the casting of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, two consummate actors playing out a theme that is unexpectedly a solid study of friendship and love.<br /><br />Carter (Morgan Freeman) narrates the story: Carter gave up his dreams for a college education and major career to support his surprise child from his wife Virginia (Beverly Todd) and has worked as a mechanic to support his own family, including his son Roger (Alfonso Freeman, Morgan's son in real life also!). After his children have all become successful, Carter is suddenly  diagnosed with terminal cancer. He is hospitalized for chemotherapy, only to be placed in the same room with the wealthy and cantankerous owner of the hospital, Edward (Jack Nicholson) who also has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and is also in the hospital for chemotherapy.  Edward's only 'friend' (he has basically alienated the world through his behavior) is his assistant Thomas (an excellent Sean Hayes) who tends to his every need.  Gradually the two disparate men grow into a friendship united by the common bond that they both must face impending death. Together they create 'the bucket list' - things they want to do before dying, and because of Edward's wealth, they leave the hospital on a worldwide adventure of skydiving, racing cars, visiting the pyramids, etc. The manner in which these two elderly men bond casts a warm glow over the film without ever touching on the maudlin risk of communication. They simply grow in their appreciation of life as they learn from each other.<br /><br />Freeman and Nicholson are in peak form here and the supporting cast is very fine.  But special credit must go to director Rob Reiner for giving us yet another film about humanism that would enrich the lives of anyone who takes the time to watch this very fine film.

It's called anamorphic and allows more of the MPEG-2 video codec to be used for the picture itself in very widescreen formats. If you don't have a 16:9 television, you need to go into the video options menu of your DVD player (not the DVD's menu, mind you) and tell it you're using a 4:3 aspect ratio display. As for the color hues and sound, I don't own the DVD, so I can't say. Somehow I find it unlikely that a major studio's video mastering would be paltry, but who knows.<p>Now for the film itself: Forbidden Planet blew me away. Human beings in the future using flying saucers. Realistic jargon. Believable military behavior and procedures. Scenes that have been used in countless other sci-fi movies, including Total Recall and Star Wars. I even noticed that David Lynch copied some of the costumes and props for his version of Dune (uniforms, rifles, gun fire, onboard microphone handset, etc). Leslie Nielsen plays a very convincing captain of the military vessel. The crew is much more at ease with each other than you see in most science fiction where there's a command structure. Then, we have the stunning Anne Francis who's got a face to die for. The plot has excellent pacing and it never gives away too much too soon, even going so far as to never show us certain unnecessary elements at all. This is definitely a must see.</p></body></html>

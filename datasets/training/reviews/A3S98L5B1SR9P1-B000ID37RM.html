<meta name="summary" content="Gregory Peck shines!"></head><body><p>This movie shows the truth of life and the unfair things that can happen. Gregory Peck plays the #1 hero of all time, Atticus Finch, who is on a mission to do what is right whatever the costs may be. He faces many hindrances along the way, but takes them like a man and refuses to give up. By defending a black man, Tom Robinson, wrongly accused of rape, he does what no other attorney in Maycomb has the courage to do. Atticus' acts also have a deep effect on his children, Jem and Scout who remember his incrdible bravery forever. I love how this film shows that people don't have to succeed to be heroes. Good things can come from the effort, too.You are crazy if you do not at least like this film. It is an American classic that cannot be forgotten.</p></body></html>

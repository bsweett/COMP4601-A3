<meta name="summary" content="Yet Another Identity Crisis"></head><body><p>Did you like the movie 'Identity' where there is like one and half hours of an absolutely fantastic setup only to have John Cusack turn into Uncle Fester in the end? Well it seems that Hollywood has yet again decided that another run at this copout would be a good idea - great premise, excellent setup and throw in the old totally unrealistic psycho split-personality twist that the story is all in some sick persons head... hell even rip the ending of The Shining "Redrum" for good measure. Is that what you want after investing 90 minutes of your time? Do you really believe in the 21st century that people have this split-personality disorder? It is about as realistic as just throwing a three-eyed alien into the movie and saying that it was the cause of it all.<br /><br />It is true that Secret Window has an excellent premise - an author, going through a divorce, living out in the country, in the middle off writer's block, meets a stranger who claims that he stole his story and then the stranger proceeds to make the writer's life a misery by killing and harming everyone around him... all because the writer stole his story, a story that our protagonist claims he wrote himself. Interesting yes, but the fact that the ending is just so lame makes it all totally worthless, however this movie does have some good points in that the final last scene is not that bad, the dialogue is quite witty throughout and both lead actors - Depp and Turturro are on flying form... but all is marred by a rehash of the stupid ending we got in Identity. How they could do this once in the 21st century is incredible given that some young talented directors can hardly get a greenlight for their next ORIGINAL project. Doing it twice just shows how terrible the whole system is. Boycott this type of garbage and watch it when it comes to television. Everyone should have known better.</p></body></html>

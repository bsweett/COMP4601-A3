<meta name="summary" content="WELL, IT'S FUNNY"></head><body><p>I was worried about the sequel to "Meet the Parents" thinking it might turn out to be rather boring and far less funny than the first part, like it often happens. But I was worrying in vain. "Meet the Fockers" lived up to its predecessor. Certainly the first part was more sophisticated and laughable, but we all know it's always difficult to keep the same level whatsoever. There's a lot of blunt humor here (like a scene with Greg's foreskin), but there's also many situational jokes that make this film just hilarious. And actually it's not the wisecracks themselves that matter, but the way they are delivered by Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Ben Stiller. I was laughing like mad throughout the whole movie, even when there seemed to be nothing to laugh at. But the way De Niro talks and makes faces can't leave you indifferent.<br /><br />Screenwriters did a very good job, they wrote Greg's parents, who are played by Hoffman and Streisand, so vivid and thruthful, all I want to say is "bravo!". From the first moment we see them, it's obvious they are just so not like Pam's parents, and it's getting crystal clear there's gonna be trouble.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman is the greatest acquisition of the film. I know he had plenty of serious, world-known movies, but this part is truly one of his best.<br /><br />The edition has interesting extras, and the principal one is a blooper-reel, which sometimes is even more funny than the movie itself.</p></body></html>

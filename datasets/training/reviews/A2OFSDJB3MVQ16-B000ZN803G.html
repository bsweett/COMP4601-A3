Can't understand why it only received just 2 oscar nominations while a lesser film like "There Will Be Blood" received more despite Day-Lewis' excellent performance (that film left me hollow). Am contemplating whether to get this in HD since Paramount has said it will be their last release in that format. Emile Hirsch should have received at least an nomination and Penn himself for Best Director.  One could argue about Chris' tragic fate but in the end he lived it the way he wanted and not by society's standards--so can we say it was wasted?!  The various persons he touched during his journey proved the validity of his life. The entire supporting cast was excellent and this is probably Penn's best film since his debut feature, "The Indian Runner". Let's hope he continues directing!!</p></body></html>

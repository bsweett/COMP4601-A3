You'll know them when you see them. They did little more than take the audience out of the moment and distract from the real brilliance of the film. Had they been left out, I would have easily given the film five stars. I wanted to explain that up front, because, apart from this quibble, Let the Right One In is a truly wonderful film.<br /><br />The film is a touching portrayal of love -- it's ability to overcome, to embrace privately what makes us original, freakish, terrible, and wonderful, and the lengths to which we will go in its name.  With a slow, steady hand, and with a wonderful gift for flashing glimpses and suggestions, the director, Tomas Alfredson, convinces us that this weird, otherworldly, and bloodthirsty place is simply another facet of the human experience.<br /><br />Some moments stand out -- when the "father," having returned home unsuccessful, asks for forgiveness, and his "child" lashes out in this ancient voice; when Eli, the forever-twelve-year-old vampire, gently caresses Oskar after she reveals, and he accepts, that she is "not a girl"; and when Oskar leaves this father's house after the arrival of a "friend," with intimations about why his mother and father are no longer together. This is truly subtle and intelligent filmmaking. It also speaks to the loneliness of modern youth. For vastly different reasons, Oskar and Eli have no meaningful relationships with adults. In their loneliness, they find each other.<br /><br />In thinking about this movie, one theme that seems especially provocative is the idea of this ancient, yet physically undeveloped vampire being drawn to the young, innocent Oskar. Like the rare young woman who is wise and world-weary beyond her years, Eli gravitates to the youthful innocence of Oskar. It perhaps fills this long forgotten need to be a child -- something that may be inherent in her stunted physical development. But, at the same time, she becomes a mother to him, a guide, and, some might say, a corrupting influence. For Eli, Oskar represents, perhaps, a last, tenuous hold on her own humanity. Throughout the film, she battles the need to draw him in with the fear that, in doing so, she will destroy the very innocence that drew her to him.<br /><br />Be patient with Let the Right One In if you think it begins too slowly. The pace is essential to its ultimate effect. This is one of the best films of the year, and one truly to savor in its graceful unfolding.</p></body></html>

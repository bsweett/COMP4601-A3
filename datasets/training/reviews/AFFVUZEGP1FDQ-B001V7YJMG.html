<meta name="summary" content="An amazing and original vampire movie...finally!"></head><body><p>"Let the Right one in" is a vampire movie that takes the idea of vampires seriously. Oskar is a 12-year old lonely boy; he is bullied in school, his parents are broken up and seems to have no friends. Oskar carries around a knife and he fantasizes of using it and taking revenge on his bullies. Then, he meets Eli, a girl that just moved to his apartment complex. Eli is special: she walks barefoot in the snow, doesn't wear a jacket and smells funny. She also has been 12 for a long time and only comes out at night. She is also capable of great violence to satisfy her hunger. Despite these things, Oskar moves past her strange qualities and they become friends. They become each other's life lines and feed the hungry loneliness that surrounds them.<br /><br />Eli is protective of Oskar and although at one point Oskar is upset about her nature, their friendship is strengthened by each passing moment. The movie is really good. It is dark, gothic, raw and at times disturbing but, it also has humor and tender moments. The nature of Eli's vampirism is somewhat explored but the main theme is that of loneliness and how Oskar and Eli complement each other. The film is beautifully shot and the end result is a great, poetic and amazing scene.</p></body></html>

Ron Perlman does a bang-up job as Hellboy who fell to Earth through a portal that was opened by the Nazi's in 1941. What separates Perlman's Hellboy from the rest is his ascerbic wit and undeniably likeable human qualities (i.e. compassion and love). But, don't get me wrong this is no lovefest. Hellboy is a killer plain and simple. He was raised by a loving scientist to rid the world of evil, so when things go wrong he's the one they call in. The movie has plenty of action and outstanding special effects that rival the X-Men series. Guillermo Del Toro does a masterful job of directing and uses the FX effectively. Overall, Hellboy is definitly worth a watch and for hardcore sci-fi or comic buffs it's a must own. Highly Recommended.</p></body></html>

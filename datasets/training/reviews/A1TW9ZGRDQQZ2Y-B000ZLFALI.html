It just went crazy on me. The songs weren't sung or performed that well and left me wishing to hear the original versions instead. The plot also didn't seem to have much purpose other than a thrown together love story mixed with a little anti-war for good measure. Across the Universe seems to be a movie that most people love or hate. I didn't hate it (the visuals were nice), but I wouldn't want to sit through it again.</p></body></html>

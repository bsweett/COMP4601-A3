I've broken this review down into seven different sections for obvious reasons, as each section is something that should be addressed when talking about either this film, this book, the people involved from the actors to the McCandless's to Sean Penn himself.<br /><br />The Book -<br /><br />There are probably more people that will initially come to this film because of the book than the other way around; but over time this film will be seen by more people that haven't read the book or possibly even be aware of a book. That's not a critique of the material, just a plain fact. More people watch films than read books these days.<br /><br />The story of Chris McCandless though, should start with the book and how Krakauer started a snowball with a simple article in `Outdoor' Magazine which A LOT of people who had met Chris (as Alex) had responded to with comments like: "Hey, I met him trying to hitch a ride ..." Jon Krakauer spent a lot of time putting the book together through accounts, phone calls, letters and meetings to find out how the information of Chris all come together; and more importantly how Chris had touched the lives and made such a stand-out impression on each of these very random people that he came across. In fact, Chris made such an impression on these people that some people read the article and wrote Krakauer stating: "This guy sounds like a guy I met near the Salton Sea, etc."  This is the real essence of how this story really came together and people should be aware of it. All of this transpired BEFORE the book. Someone had even heard the story of a dead hiker found in Alaska on Paul Harvey and Westerberg thought it might be him so he called the Alaskan authorities. Strangely, the Paul Harvey piece was how I had first heard of McCandless as well. So, knowing what you know now, maybe having read the book and seen the film, one must give proper credence to the impact of Chris McCandless in the lives of the people he met. I'll come back to this point later.<br /><br />The Screenplay & Film -<br /><br />Having watched hundreds of films through the years and then going back and listening to the Director's Commentary whenever possible, I've learned a great many things. Foremost, which is relevant to this story, is how Robert Zemeckis worked with several writer's over the course of a handful of years sharpening the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXA2">Forrest Gump</a> adapted script. Anyone who had seen the film and read the book, knows the point that's coming. Sometimes the spirit of the material is more important than the bulk of the material. In the case of Forrest Gump, I believe Zemeckis stated that the screenplay went through three different writers and multiple revisions until the last person, Eric Roth had figured out what Forrest Gump was really about. Christopher McCandless's story was surely about the spirit of the material; and definitely not about the bulk, which is how it comes across on the screen as delivered -- and very choppy at that.<br /><br />Sean Penn adapted this directly from the book, decided which parts to focus on and what to leave out. The real problem seems to stem from Penn not wanting to get into the middle of the McCandless / Supertramp dynamic which was painfully obvious in the book, but Penn tries to maintain the high ground of being impartial which doesn't really serve the story. Sean Penn probably would've been better served leaning one way or the other regarding McCandless and showing us "why" through the film, rather than leaving it ambiguous. The whole point of being there, was to be transported to a point of view.<br /><br />Christopher McCandless was not a middle-of-the-road / dry-journalism kind of guy. I will say that this long drawn out, meandering approach worked well for Penn with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005PJ6Q">The Indian Runner</a>, an older film of his which is one of my top ten films of all time. In Indian Runner, Penn let the viewer decide and observe the true nature of Frank Roberts, wickedly played by Viggo Mortenson. Viggo emoted so thickly, so heavily and breathed such life into the character that you couldn't help but be compelled - no matter how long the movie was. When it ended you were looking everywhere for more footage, maybe a book, a Bruce Springsteen album, footnotes, anything that would give you more about what you had just seen. But with Chris, Penn should've made a decision about which was a greater loss - Supertramp or McCandless, simply because Frank was a fictional character, while Chris was not.<br /><br />Ignoring the psychological breakdown and split of the character should've been the touchstone of this movie, but it wasn't. The split, Alexander Supertramp, was treated as just a shallow creation or a childish whim by a foolish youth - instead of the self-absorbed superman from Nietzsche's `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845882423">"Thus Spake Zarathustra"</a>' that Chris had imagined himself to be which seemed to take root while he was at Emory. Most of the readers of the Krakauer book seemed to have bonded with the idealistic Supertramp, rather than the foolish McCandles that the readers of Outdoor Magazine unanimously gave a thumbs down to for the fear of being a reckless role-model to other readers and enthusiasts.<br /><br />This film does not tell the story from the perspective of Alex Supertramp, although it tries to shed light to it. It also does not tell the story of Chris McCandless, although it tries to convince us of this, by wrapping itself in the facts that were collected by Jon Krakauer and passing itself as a film version with the same title.<br /><br />However, some of the book's complicated undertone of sadness, confusion, and idealism are lightly palpable in the film. Chris McCandless was a romantic; Krakauer's book appreciates that, as well as Chris's youthful idealism and smugness. But unfortunately, the film seems to miss most of this.<br /><br />A real, and massive breakdown in this film was the use of narration. While I am a huge advocate of V.O. Narration, a case exists here for the absence of one. Having Jena Malone, of Donnie Darko fame, and a mediocre talent, speaking her inner thoughts over scenic footage does this film a serious disservice, comes across as inconsistent and tacked on for effect. There were many other ways to tell this story better, but sometimes good books do not always translate into good movies.<br /><br />The Music -<br /><br />Eddie Vedder, like Sean Penn, is difficult as a personality to separate from his art due to certain  things that have transpired in the last decade. Anytime I hear Pearl Jam these days, all I can hear is a talented musician who wasted himself indulging in his own flaws - strangely much like McCandless, except Vedder did this with his career and not his life. Vedder thought that it was appropriate to repeat and stick with the now-dead North-West sound which is the last bastion of Seattle Grunge. Granted, this soundtrack is probably the biggest departure for him in a long time, but looking at the contribution of his work for this film, one is left wondering - why Vedder? The music sounds uninspired and dull, where nothing really stands out thematically and there actually seems to be a void where a musical theme should be. Penn should've befriended Gabriel Yared as the first choice to do the score. But I find this just one more bad choice in a long line of bad choices made by Penn for the production of this movie. Going back to Indian Runner, which has a great score and a well-placed soundtrack, it seems as if the magic just couldn't be duplicated for what would've been a great film and probably an equally great soundtrack and score.<br /><br />I do want to state that I don't agree with the Awards Academy that the music comes off as "too song based", whatever that means. I think that's one of the most ridiculous statements ever to come out of whatever administration Hollywood has. I also believe that, even though I didn't like it, Vedder should at least been nominated for his efforts for an Oscar.<br /><br />The Actors -<br /><br />I'm holding the minority report on this one, but I really don't believe that Emile Hirsch was all that good in this film. Yes, he has a basic resemblance to McCandless as any young, mousy haired twenty-something actor would. McCandless was a magnetic personality that people were struck into awe by when they met, even once. Emile Hirsch has none of those qualities, if he does, they certainly weren't evinced in this movie. I feel he came off bland and gave a very weak performance of McCandless, which actually bordered on shameful and pedestrian. It was if someone had asked him to play Jesus Christ and he decided that maybe a hollow representation of Truman Capote was more appropriate. Emile Hirsch's acting in this is the real Achilles heal here and couldn't have been further off the mark. There could've been so many other actors who would've handled this role with more realism, energy and vivaciousness. Emile Hirsch's rendition of McCandless is pretty sad to say the least, he was filler for those just wanting to navel-gaze.<br /><br />The casting director and Penn set up a would-be Oscar dream-tream with the supporting cast. Hal Holbrook gives his "John Wayne" performance here and does so magnificently and very memorably. Catherine Keener is dynamic, William Hurt (my favorite actor in this)  is magnetic, delivering a strong and convincing portrayal of the person you encounter when you read the book and Vince Vaughn is a nice choice for Wayne Westerburg. So what could go so insidiously wrong here?<br /><br />The Critics -<br /><br />A lot has been said regarding what was left in and what was left out, differing between the book and the movie. It should be stated that McCandless had a basic road map of the area, some money, his identification cards and some have speculated -- a broken or injured arm. Some cite the picture of Chris in front of the bus  as evidence-light. Looking closely at his right arm, it appears not to in the sleeve but under his shirt wrapped in a sling. In a later photograph though, he's seen with both arms visible and free from sling or obvious injury.<br /><br />I have posted both photos above for those interested to see.<br /><br />Chris M. / Alex S. -<br /><br />What would Christopher J. McCandless say about all this? How would he have felt about a feature film immortalizing and lionizing his deeds for better or worse?<br /><br />McCandless did want to become a writer, this much is known from the friends he met and made. Had he lived, he would've wanted to chronicle his adventures, and maybe becoming famous for it. If he did, it would've been an after effect and if a film was made of his works -- spoils of war, so to speak. But this is all hyperbole and supposition now. The truth is no one would want the worst decisions of their early twenties to be the defining moments of their lives and then be broadcast across the globe for all to see without any say.<br /><br />Alex Supertramp would've loathed the telling, the filming and the mass marketing of this effort. Alex would've wondered where the spirit and the fire and the message was had he sat in a theatre and watched this play out. Perhaps this was the problem McCandless's parents had when they saw this during the screening, maybe they "felt the lack of it", to quote Penn from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005PJ8T">another movie</a>. Having been author to anti-establishment writing, I may be a little biased in my viewpoint. I only state this as some readers of this review might click on my other reviews or see my writings and then feel that I was being inconsistent. While I can understand McCandless and see the world of which he spoke of, as an ex-Marine and a long-distance hiker of the Appalachian trail, of his methods and planning - I cannot abide. So, like many other readers and viewers, I too have a split opinion of McCandless.<br /><br />Sean Penn -<br /><br />Like I stated about Vedder, it's hard sometimes for consumers of art to sometimes remove their view of the artist from the art and therefore see it unobstructed. Sean Penn has done and said many things in the last numerous years to anger enough people, and isolate himself with his point of view. Maybe making a film about a man who railed inwardly in anger over consumerism, urban blight and gross waste and personal attachment was more powerful and greater than anything he could've said or done by himself. So, at least in the spirit of the thing, he does deserve that much credit - if that was the case. Otherwise, many viewers might see this movie and only witness the smugness of Chris McCandless and the smugness of Sean Penn, and thus walk away disappointed and regretful of the time spent. That, at least, does sum up much of the bad reviews so far about this film.<br /><br />Living on the West Coast, in Los Angeles, I've actually crossed paths with Penn a few times so far in life. The last time was in San Francisco, when I was spending a long day at the bar drinking at Tosca's in North beach. It's the kind of place that most people, tourists included don't go, because they just don't understand the allure; which is absolutely fine by me. My exchange with him was brief and cordial. If I would've seen this movie first, I would've probably had a lot more to say to him.<br /><br />I wanted to give this more stars because I do appreciate Sean Penn's contribution to film, his acting and his temperament. I also wanted to give it more stars for Chris McCandless, but ... it's more a review of the film than it is of any one person.</p></body></html>

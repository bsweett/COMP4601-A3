They don't really tote that around, but the movie buffsa will know it.  And being how it isn't original, that is where it comes up lacking.  First off, they push Dark Water at you like it's The Ring or The Grudge or one of those new-fangled hack-slash-scare-and-scream bits of tripe that have been spewing out of the gullet of Hollywood for the past few years.  The New Breed of Horror Flicks.  Well...  The first thing you will realize is that Dark Wateris not scary at all.  I didn't even flinch once.  But once you get past the preconceived notion that you're supposed to be afraid or grossed out or whatever, you realize that Dark Water is actually a pretty good movie.  Filled with dark amosphere and creepy settings, this is definitely not one of those semi-retarded ultra-gore Saw movies.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly is a recently divorced single mother with past mental issues who finds a place to live in the most god-awfully creepy tenemant in New York.  This place looks like Attica prison turned into condos.  Seriously.  She and her small daughter take an apartment on the ninth floor and everything seems to be going fine.  New school for the daughter.  New job for the mom.  The occasional spat between ex-husband & ex-wife.  And then the leaks begin.<br /><br />This movie is the most straight-forward ghost story you will ever see and when you realize where the story is going, you'll slap yourself in the head.  Duh!  But it does have  freaky ending and that's cool.  Not overly gory.  I like that.  Not that gore bothers me.  When it's used gratuitously for no pupose other than shock-value, that's f*cking irritating.  Definitely a flick worth seeing.  Wouldn't pay full-price for it because it's pretty predictable.  But it's a good mid-range suspense ride.  When you watch the dark, creeping, oozing dark water slittering down from the ceiling, you will cringe.  That's movie atmosphere at it's best.<br /><br />Dig it.</p></body></html>

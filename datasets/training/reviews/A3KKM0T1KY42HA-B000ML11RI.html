But the gore, gore and more gore is often minimalized by an effect that shows the splatter in off white and usually only the carnage gets red treatment. In fact, the entire movie was in some cool variation of black and white with red as the predominant color that does not get black and white treatment. Oh, there's an occasional pair of blue-eyes here and there and other brief color treatments, but the film is mostly in the funky black and white.<br /><br />Sin City jumps around a bit similar to Pulp Fiction. The jumping is actually effective and easy to follow. The movie is the story of the pursuit of a couple of serial killers...one pursued by Bruce Willis, the other pursued by Mickey Rourke...and the story of a network of hookers...and how the pursuit of the serial killers and the network of hookers all ultimately interconnect.<br /><br />Captivating, very entertaining, and suspenseful at times. An original movie with a great cast. Worthy certainly of a rental. If you have to own, you'll likely get more for your money with the recut and extended edition, so I'd opt for that.</p></body></html>

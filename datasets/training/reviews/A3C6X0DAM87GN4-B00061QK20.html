<meta name="summary" content="The Best Movie Of 2003!"></head><body><p>Zhang Yimou's films are like the "perfect woman". They're beautiful to look at and intelligent. <p> I've been reading that people have been comparing this film to Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". People who compare this film to Lee's film, are not very educated in foreign films. And I don't say this to sound like a snob. "Hero" is similar to Chen Kaige's "The Emperor & the Assassin". The story-line follows the same time in history. And to be honest both film are masterpieces. But, I admit as I watched this film in it's opening moments I thought to myself that "Hero" seems to lack something "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "The Emperor & the Assassin" had. This film doesn't seem as majestic as either. Also the fight scenes don't seem as amazing as those in Lee's film. But, Zhang Yimou's film possess other qualities that make this film just as impressive. Yimou's film's are always heartfelt and emotional. There is such passion in his films. "Hero" is such an impressive movie. It's just as touching as Yimou's other masterpieces like "Raise the Red Lantern", "To Live" & "The Road Home".<p> The story revolves around a warrior named "nameless" (played by Jet Li). He has managed to kill three of the King's most feared assassins. And now has been rewarded by meeting the king. King, intrigued to discover how one man could have achieved such a feat, ask him to tell him the story of how he accomplished this. "Nameless" tells his story of how he was able to deceit the three of them. But, soon something unexpected happens in this movie, and this is when the movie had me hooked. And soon we are asked to question ourselves as to what is true. And soon we are thinking of another classic foreign film. Kurosawa's "Rashomon".<p> "Hero" has so many hearfelt moments in it that we gladly give our emotions to the characters. The movie's ultimate message, without spoiling the film for you, is about peace. Here once again Zhang Yimou has made a bold, beautiful, tender film that all should be able to enjoy. I haven't seen many movies so far this year, but, I doubt I'll be able to see a better film than this one.<p> Bottom-line: Might not have the gradeur of films like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "The Emperor & the Assassin", but, it makes up for it with it's emotional impact and Yimou's strong directing. So far, the year's best film!</p></body></html>

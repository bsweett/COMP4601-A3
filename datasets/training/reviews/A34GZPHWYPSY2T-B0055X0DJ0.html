<meta name="summary" content="The Fate of Shia's Hand Was More Interesting"></head><body><p>I will be up front: I gave this hateful film two stars because it had a few quality minutes...I say MINUTES.<br /><br />That is because I cannot tolerate anything getting a watered-down rating that it does not deserve. This smelly gym sock got a misleading PG, and I can't think of a better movie to tell parents to keep their little kids from seeing.<br /><br /> Let me be more explicit: MPAA ratings have deliberately fuzzed and confused lines between them. A PG-13 rating, for example, may contain some garbage that would offend sensitive or very moral adults. Yet its simple explanation is parents ought to be warned that a PG-13 film might contain material inappropriate for kids under 13.<br /><br />In other words, what the hell does that mean?? They can show what they want. TRANSFORMERS is an excellent example: it has torture scenes, lots of foul language, terrible violence and some sexually 'suggestive' material that I wouldn't really like 16-year-olds watching. Yet there it is...and this film should have been rated R.<br /><br />It is this type of evil Hollyweird bait-and-switch in film that I have come to resent. I've seen excellent films undeservedly rated R...why? Why rated R without any noticeable reason? Swearing? It's the only explanation I can find, yet TRANSFORMERS has more swearing than adults can perceive at the first viewing. (I'm sure kids hear it instantly.)<br /><br />The storyline is of ZERO interest to me, and it will be of zero interest to anyone over 9 years of age--ironically, this film isn't viewable by those under the age of 17. There is a great deal of frankly dirty humor, four-letter words fly like robot parts, Shia is tortured horribly in a particularly disgusting scene...<br /><br />...oh, and this thing had more TERMINATOR in it than TERMINATOR SALVATION had.<br /><br />There are sequels and what I call GELQUELS--and this is a gelquel because it made no sense, doesn't fit, has so much ugly garbage in it that I cannot believe this is what passes for a sequel. The original TRANSFORMERS was fun. It was a bit of fluff for kids, but it was intriguing to watch, the action was good (way too much military, just like this rotten offering), and you didn't have to hang your--or your children's--heads for seeing it.<br /><br />Heck, even my wife liked it and said Shia and the Transformers were cute.<br /><br />This film, no way. It is execrable all the way, and wishing will not change that soiled diaper. As a fan and film buff, I really, really hope Shia is going to start getting better roles than this.</p></body></html>

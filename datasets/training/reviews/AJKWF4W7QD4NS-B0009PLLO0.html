The first thing you'll notice is some outrageously over the top acting, not to mention the mis-casting of Colin Farrell in the title role with a blonde mane and unquestionable love for his long time buddy (Jared Leto).  Angelina Jolie sleep walks as Alexander's snake charming mother, a heavy Val Kilmer looks like he just walked off the set of Wonderland and had makeup over his eye applied, and the only bright spot of the entire casting is the great Anthony Hopkins providing a reflective voice over throughout the film, and it's the only way you'll know what's going on in this otherwise incoherent mess.  It's hard to believe that with the talent involved in Alexander that it turned out like this.  We know that he was a legendary conquerer and strategist, but by the time the credits roll, the only question you're left asking is what's the point?  It's disappointing that something Stone appeared to have so much heart in ended up like this (his commentary is definitely worth hearing on this DVD release as he discusses the film's bad press), but believe it or not, Alexander could be a lot worse.  Worth seeing for Stone afficiondos or those interested in Alexander the Great, but all others should avoid.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Cast-Good Movie"></head><body><p>A very pleasant surprise, The Prestige, brings to the screen the destructive enmity between two rival magicians who will go to great lengths to settle an old score.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, Andy Serkis and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, The Prestige is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!</p></body></html>

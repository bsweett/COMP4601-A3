<meta name="summary" content="Oskar Schindler as Super-Agent..."></head><body><p>"Taken" is one of those action thrillers with a main character who is or was a double-dog secret government wreaker of mayhem.  Written by Luc Besson, who also made "Leon: The Professional", "La Femme Nikita" and "The Transporter," you go into this film expecting that there will be several scenes featuring our hero single-handedly taking on a room full of bad guys and, as my Granny used to say, whuppin' the tar out of them.  Actually - he does more than whup most of them.  Most wind up looking pretty dead, although no one stops to check for a pulse once the bodies start piling up.<br /><br />The distinguishing characteristic "Taken" has over its brethren is the star.  Instead of Jason Statham or The Rock (20 years ago it would have been Steven Seagal or Jean-Claude Van Damme), "Taken" stars lauded Irishman Liam Neeson.  The guy who played Schindler brings a degree of gravitas to a role not yet earned by most action stars.  There's a reason he provides the voice of Aslan in the Narnia films.<br /><br />In this film he plays Bryan Mills, who spent most of his married life on the road doing secret C.I.A. stuff, and enjoying it, but neglected his wife and daughter.  As a consequence Lenore (played by Famke Janssen) is now his ex-wife, and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace from "Lost") lives with mom and new step-dad, a super-rich businessman.<br /><br />Bryan regrets not being a better Dad and husband, so he has retired from the agency and moved near Kimmy, but when Kim lives in a mansion worthy of an NFL owner, it's tough for Bryan to compete for Kim's affection.<br /><br />Kim is invited with a friend on a Paris vacation and Mom pressures Bryan to sign the necessary forms so that Kim can leave the country.  After years of dealing with the world's shady characters, Bryan is reluctant, but signs the forms after giving Kim a few rules - mainly to stay in touch with an international cell phone Bryan gives her.<br /><br />Kim is in her opulent Paris digs for all of about an hour before Albanian drug and prostitute slave traders break into the apartment.  Dad is on the phone chastising Kim as the bad guys break in, and Bryan is able to piece together a few pieces of information when he tells Kim to give him as much description as she can before she is kidnapped.<br /><br />The rest of the movie consists of Bryan tearing apart Paris, one room of bad guys at a time.  At least four times he strolls casually into a situation surrounded by four or more baddies, and after the first few times the Mrs. and I would turn to each other and predict "I think THOSE guys are about to have a BAD day" each subsequent time he encountered more eurotrashy guys.<br /><br />At an hour and a half, Besson and director Pierre Morel keep the pace at a level that barely gives you time to catch your breath.  It's entertaining in a Bourne kind of way, and it makes me feel better seeing a man ten years my senior able to whup the tar out of a hundred bad guys.</p></body></html>

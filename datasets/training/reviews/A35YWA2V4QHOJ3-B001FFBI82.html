There's nothing like macho and usually morbid Marine Corps humor to get me laughing, and this film offers a great deal of that!<br /><br />This is what I could call a somewhat unconventional war movie.  Most of the film is centered around Operation Desert Shield.  Instead of most war movies where we see charcters trying to accomplish a particular objective(s) while encased in the fog of war, this movie approaches war from a different angle.  It's mostly about the anticipation of fighting was Saddam Insane called the "Mother of all battles" (a battle which, of course, never did materialize).<br /><br />Instead of dodging bombs & bullets, the Marines have to deal with 6 months of tedious drills, getting Dear John letters, worrying about getting Dear John letters, having their nerves frayed by living in close-quarters with others, coping with the harsh desert environment and having to overcome the sheer boredom of it all.<br /><br />The movie does a good job of depicting just how mundane it can be to be a soldier on the supposed "front lines" in this day & age.  The Marine Snipers in the movie were among the first to land in Saudi Arabia, and yet they only get to flirt with actual combat duties.  There is certainly an irony in that.<br /><br />Jamie Fox portrays one of those gung-ho Marine Staff Sergeants who it's easy to poke fun at.  While I was in the Navy there was a running joke that 20 years of sea duty turned men's minds to mush. Sailors start to actually worship the Navy after all of that time deployed, and the military becomes a sort of obession.  Looks like the same sort of thing happens in the other services as well!<br /><br />If you want a "traditional" war movie, this one may not be for you.  One of the scenes, just before the Marines were deployed, showed them watching APOCOLYPSE NOW in a theatre.  I believe that scene was put in to show the contrast between a "dramatic" war movie & what the real-life ordeal of a soldier would be like in Desert Storm.<br /><br /> If you're a fan of military movies in general or if you have been in the military, I believe you'll find this movie to your liking.  It's not a great movie, but it is a curious one.</p></body></html>

But what I say, is the film based on the letters of Robert Gould Shaw who commanded the 54th Massachusetts.  Much of the film deals with the black soldiers but it is told from its commander's perspective.<br /><br />This is a great film about the civil war and the first black outfit.  The film was directed by Edward Zwick, a great director from television (Family, thirtysomething).  He does a great job of blending the drama and action.<br /><br />Matthew Broderick was best known for his roles in teenage films and found a film that would usher him into adult roles.  The soldiers were gathered from the up and coming ranks.  While most had success in a film, they were not considered bankable stars. These actors include Denzel Washington (Oscar winner Best Supporting Actor), Morgan Freeman (who should have won for this film but was nominated for Best Actor for his other film that year Driving Miss Daisy), Andre Braugher (from Homicide: Life on the Streets).<br /><br />This is a must see film for everyone.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS: None</p></body></html>

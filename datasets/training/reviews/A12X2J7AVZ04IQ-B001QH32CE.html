Can't say much that hasn't been said, but the concerns of impending motherhood have been as well expressed here as in any I've seen.  Keri Russell is luminous, a complete performance. Jeremy Sisto is fine as the macho redneck jerk husband; Cheryl Hines and Ms. Shelly herself provide fine support as her buddies. I really liked Andy Griffith, but who doesn't? Nathan Fillion was remarkable as the nervous new doctor who has the best connection with our unfortunate heroine;  the final scenes of the film are worthy of cheer. A true, feel-good film. Ms. Shelly will be missed. Her murder, when she caught an illegal Ecuadoran robber in her home, holds another argument: Why? And why was he here in the first place? The DVD I watched has lots of extras, including footage of Ms. Shelly and interviews & comments from the stars. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Two Great Actors Elevate This Scarface-Like Story"></head><body><p>The best thing this movie had going for it - which is no surprise - is the acting duo of Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. How many bad movies do you see with either of those guys starring in them? Not many, and neither actor disappoints here. Both play fascinating guys, Washington, a big gangster ("Frank Lucas") and Crowe, an honest cop ("Richie Roberts")<br /><br />This movie reminded me a lot of the '83 "Scarface" film in which Tony Montana (Al Pacino) rises from the bottom up to be a big drug lord, only to have things crumble big-time. We see a similar tale here with "Lucas," except that his fall is sudden in this stor.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott and photographer Harris Savides also give us a slick- looking film, very pretty spots and stylishly-directed. The story wasn't quite as good as the "hype," but I was never bored despite the two- and-a-half-hour length of it. I was a bit confused in the first 25 minutes but things straightened out after that.<br /><br />It was entertaining enough for me that I'd watch it again.</p></body></html>

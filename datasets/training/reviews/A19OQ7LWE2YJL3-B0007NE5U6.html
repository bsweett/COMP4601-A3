Bridgett is a bit more annoyingly stupid, but the movie is cute, and there's even more of Colin Firth.... to which I say hip, hip, hooray!  What a fabulous actor.  His character is so totally different from Hugh Grant's that sometimes Mark Darcy can seem really boring and dull.  The love scenes with Hugh Grant & Renee Zellwegger were definitely much steamier than the airtime between Firth & Zellwegger.<br /><br />I don't know why this movie didn't do better at the box office.  Our only comments negatively, are that the star, Renee Zellwegger did not look as cute as she did in the first movie, and she is perhaps even chubbier and less attractive, and sillier and bubble-headed.  A very annoying character indeed.</p></body></html>

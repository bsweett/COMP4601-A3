<meta name="summary" content="Technically brilliant, but I wonder about the message"></head><body><p>I will start by saying that, technically, "Pan's Labyrinth" is one of the best films that I have seen in a long time. Set during the Spanish Civil War, "Pan's Labyrinth" tells two stories, one of the fight between the Fascists and the rebels at the end of the war, and a fairy tale centred around the painfully lonely step-daughter of a Fascist army captain. The production values of this film are very high, evidently much effort has been put into making the historical elements of this story as realistic as possible, and I was very impressed by the way in which the director interwove the fantasy elements with historical facts. There is no doubt in my mind that this film deserves the swag of awards that it won. However, after marvelling at the technical brilliance of this film, I did find myself wondering about the message that it was trying to send.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" is a very dark movie, both with respect to lighting and plot. Although the main character, Ofelia, is a child, this film is very violent and probably shouldn't be shown to young children. Captain Vidal, Ofelia's step-father, is a sadistic man who is shown torturing his enemies on several occasions. That aside, however, I found the whole film to be lacking in hope. As a child, Ofelia has no choice in where she lives and throughout the film, Ofelia is shown on numerous occasions to have little choice in what she does. All of the adults around her either want to harm her or use her. No one really seems to care about her well-being at all in either this world or Ofelia's fantasy world. Even the historical fact that the Fascists did win the Spanish Civil War, adds to the general hopelessness of this film. I just don't understand why the writer/director decided to make a film that is this bleak. In a way, I see this film as being "Don Juan DeMarco"'s dark counterpart. Both films deal with people moving in to a fantasy world to escape an unpleasant reality (or are these fantasy world's real?), but whereas "Don Juan DeMarco" uplifts the audience, "Pan's Labyrinth" doesn't.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I am glad I have seen this film. As an aspiring writer, I feel that there is much that can be learnt from this film, with regard to how to write a very good story, and up until the end, I did enjoy the film. I just wouldn't recommend this film to someone who needed cheering up.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pretty heavy lifting required for so little payoff"></head><body><p>This is yet another Sandra Bullock movie I wanted to like, but the movie fought me every step of the way.  She is such a likeable actress and is so enjoyable on the screen.  Why does she end up with so many of these lackluster vehicles?<br /><br />The movie has such a heavy mood that it would have to give us a big payoff to justify such constant oppression and depression.  But there never is a big payoff.  What there is one has to rationalize into it once the movie is over.<br /><br />For me the movie was a kind of blend of Groundhog Day without the humor, Frequency without the active sense of doing something about the situation (to her credit, Bullock's Linda Hanson does come to grips with what she is facing.  However, I didn't.).<br /><br />Screenwriters need to figure out that a sad ending has to be justified by either an uplift that makes it all understandable or an unsparing bleakness that cauterizes as it wounds.  This kind of dripping sadness is typified by Linda's visit with the priest.  She comes away with something that we can't really see and can only project in later, but she continues without any meaningful definition of faith nor is her commitment to God rekindled.<br /><br />The whole time continuum disruption plot device is interesting and handled with appropriate fuzziness and confusion.  Linda isn't particularly an intellectual or analytical person, so she struggles in putting the pieces together.  Julian McMahon does a fine job as Jim Hanson.  He is a work obsessed man who loves himself and his ideas of his self-importance more than his family.  He flatters himself that he loves them and provides for them so that entitles him to ignore them.  That sounds like reality for too many families!  In the final analysis, this is a film about Jim and Linda and whether they can relocate their love and rekindle their marriage before it is ended one way or the other.<br /><br />Not a bad movie, but in some ways not worth the work.  Still, it is Sandra Bullock.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not Perfect"></head><body><p>This is a decent movie, but not a great one.  What propels this film is Will Smith.  He is the perfect likeable person to play the part and you find yourself routing for him throughout the film.  He plays the character as very human, so he is far from being an angel.  But he is a good man trying to do the best he can for his son and himself.  The story feels a bit incomplete at points, but it basically gets the job done.  It might have been nice to continue the story on a little more after his first steps to success.  Pretty good turn by Smith's son Jaden as his onscreen son.  This is a nice feel good movie worth watching.</p></body></html>

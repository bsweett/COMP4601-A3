<meta name="summary" content="Harry Lime"></head><body><p>"I never knew the Vienna before the war"....<br /><br />Thus begins one of the greatest films ever made and one of the greatest film characters ever created in the charismatic and brilliantly dangerous Harry Lime. Who created him has been argued about for years. Welles was always diplomatic and gave credit to Carol Reed, but anyone who has ever seen this film knows better. Fans of Orson Welles can easily discern his fingerprints everywhere.<br /><br />He brings the enigmatic Lime to life, his genius hanging over every frame of this wonderful Carol Reed production. Joseph Cotten, a friend and staple in a lot of his films, is on hand as pulp western writer Holly Martins. When Cotten comes to postwar Vienna it is an uncoordinated international mess, the black market thriving in the chaos. When Martins discovers his old friend Harry Lime is dead this film really begins.<br /><br />Alida Valli is the strikingly beautiful actress Cotten falls for, but has no chance with because she's in love with his old friend Harry. But Harry might not be so dead after all, at least not according to Trevor Howard, the detective hot on Harry's heels for racketeering. Cotten is having none of it and sets out to clear his friend's name. What follows is the most stylishly filmed noir in film history.<br /><br />The stark black and white photography and the off-kilter camera angles serve to highlight a postwar world where things are not quite right. From the moment Welles steps out of the shadows into the streets of Vienna we are mesmerized. Harry Lime is almost amused by the chase and the proceedings. The scene on a ferris wheel between Martins and Harry, who may not be the same man he knew, is unforgettable, as is Lime's views of the Swiss!<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film, you've been missing one of the five best films ever made. Whenever I think of Welles, this is what I think of. His Harry Lime is unforgettable. Welles would later portray the same character on a weekly radio show. When Martins discovers what Harry has been up to he must make a decision that will change his chances with Valli, and could cost him a lot more.<br /><br />Anton Karas' zither theme helps set the off-center mood for this film and is justly famous. It is not something that would work independent of the film but is a perfect match for what is happening onscreen. All the extra goodies on this Blu-Ray Criterion edition are listed in the product description. The most fabulous of these, for radio lovers at least, is Welles' portrayal of Harry Lime in one of the finest from that radio series.<br /><br />Every single part of this film works within the atmospheric framework to create a dark and exciting jigsaw puzzle you'll never forget. A true screen classic.</p></body></html>

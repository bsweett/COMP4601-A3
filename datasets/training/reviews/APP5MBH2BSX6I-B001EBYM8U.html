<meta name="summary" content="Unforgettable but nearly unwatchable"></head><body><p>I'm having a very hard time deciding how to rate this film, but the four-star treatment is the result of balancing its high and low points.  For instance, the overall tone of the film, with its immense amounts of violence and foul language, and completely oppressive sense of hopelessness, is not exactly my idea of a pleasurable motion picture experience.  Still, considering the subject matter, it is appropriate and the filmmakers bring it across quite well.<p>The subject matter is the world of vice cops, and if this tale is to be believed, they're all corrupt.  In fact, not only the vice cops but the heads of several major departments within the LAPD are all lost souls without redeeming graces.  This is a world where evil battles evil, and the prizes are convictions in court and large amounts of cash.  The only real law, however, is the law of the jungle.  This is unrealistic to the point of losing its cred, and is overdone.<p>Denzel Washington earned his Oscar for Best Actor in portraying plainclothes narcotics officer Alonzo Harris, who has the task of training young Jake (Ethan Hawke) in the ways of the trade.  Washington does an incredible job of keeping us all guessing as to Alonzo's true nature, as he neatly justifies all of his disgusting and irredeemable actions on the streets, and Jake (and we) continually have to wonder whether to go along with Alonzo or just give up and hate the man.  By the time Alonzo's corruption is fully revealed, Jake, the only character in the entire film with a sense of hope, has had his hope dashed as well as us.<p>All this is beautifully done.  Unlike at least one other reviewer here, I had no problem with the pacing, the dialogue, etc., but found the craft of filmmaking quite well done in most respects.  The major shortcoming for me, other than the overall filth of it all, was a couple of acting performances that really messed things up.<p>One of these is a child actor, a kid who plays Alonzo's son.  This tyke is detached from his world to a completely unbelievable degree, reacting to everyone and everything with absolute boredom, even an extended shootout in his own apartment.  Honestly, the director could have propped up a cardboard cutout of a child and gotten as much out of it.  Even worse is Snoop Dogg, who couldn't lose himself in a character if you drugged, blindfolded, and handcuffed him and parachuted him into the role.  Oh wait, no need to drug this overrated goof.<p>Ultimately this is well worth four stars for its effectiveness and for the performance of Washington, a favorite of mine who is brilliant beyond words in this role.  Still, the tone and content made me feel as if I'd been bathed in a barrel of filthy oil.  I had to take a shower.<p>I will never forget this film, but I never want to see it again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Such a disappointment."></head><body><p>Rocky Balboa is the final installment of the Rocky films and boy was I disappointed! I just hated this film, Adrian is dead, Rocky is working in an Italian resturant, he is estranged from his son, and he tries to make an ill-fated comeback in the boxing world. This film was praised so much by critcs and fans so I thought, well I've seen all the Rocky films - why not give the last one a try? I remember watching this in the theatre and just dreading every moment. Stallone looks miserable (nice plastic surgery, not!), the writing is absolutely corny and stale and the premise is depressing. I really tried to like this film but I felt something was missing. Stick to the first 5 Rocky films, those are worth every penny.</p></body></html>

But that was before "Cinderella Man."<br /><br />All of Howard's films look great; have at least decent screenplays and more importantly, many exhibit Howard's deep sympathy for his characters...i.e., "A Beautiful Mind."<br /><br />In "The Cinderella Man" he deals with the almost mythical, though real, life of boxer James Braddock (Russell Crowe), born in the early 1900's and as much a hero to the depression-era public as was Seabiscuit.<br /><br />In a lot of ways this film reminded me of "Seabiscuit" in that, Gary Ross' filmed version of the Laura Hildebrand book addresses many of the same themes: the battle of good against evil, the rich against the poor, the horrible strain of the depression on the USA and the triumph of hard work and heart over the arrogance of innate talent and rampant hedonism.<br /><br />Russell Crowe plays Braddock very smartly: his Braddock is a simple man who loves his wife (a wasted Renee Zelwegger in a thankless role) and children and will do anything to make sure that their meager needs are met. There is a heartbreaking scene in which Braddock: down on his luck, basically jobless, washed-up as a boxer goes to the bar at Madison Square Garden and pleads with his old cronies for $18 so that the power in his house can be reconnected so that his family can have heat during a particularly bad winter. This scene is persuasively staged and Crowe is so touching and sad yet courageous that it brings tears to your eyes. Crowe has never been better: he brings palpable integrity to this role that cannot be faked.<br /><br />As Joe Gould, Braddock's boxing coach and manager, Paul Giamatti is also brilliant. Giamatti, free of all the smarminess and whine of "Sideways," just about walks away with this picture.<br /><br />Braddock was a hero of the people and the 35,000 people who fill Madison Square Garden for his Heavyweight title bout with Max Baer are there to support him. And their absolute silence as he enters the arena for that bout is thrilling proof of their love, devotion and reverence for Braddock, for they sense that this may be the last time they see him enter the ring...it could very possibly be Braddock's wake.<br /><br />Writing about Braddock, Damon Runyon has said: "In all the history of the boxing game, you'll find no human interest story to compare." Amen to that, Damon...Amen.</p></body></html>

It's like getting back to your childhood, except the technology wasn't as advanced those days, but anyways. The idea of superheroes fighting evil in an animated movies is great. The sounds, voices, everything about this movie is great. A superhero family trying to live "an ordinary" life is funny and also unpredictable. You can watch this movie with a boyfriend/girlfriend, little kids, friends,anyone. It's great. I'm sure most of you will love it.</p></body></html>

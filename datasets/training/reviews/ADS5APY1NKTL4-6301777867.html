<meta name="summary" content="fantastic film about a very important chapter in U.S. history......"></head><body><p>Generally, I am not a huge fan of action films, but I make an exception with GLORY, quite possibly one of the best historical dramas ever filmed.  Colonel Shaw (Matthew Broderick), a 25 year old volunteer soldier in the Federal Army during the American Civil War, helped lead the 54th Regiment, made up of (predominantly) former Black slaves.  Shaw encountered and had to fight off great opposition and racism toward his regiment, along with Private Trip (Academy Award winner Denzel Washington) and Sargaent Major John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman).<br /><br />This film is moving, the performances are fantastic and the story is beautifully and artistically presented by director Edward Zwick.  I really think that this should be a mandatory Black History Month film and is definitely an important part of U.S. history worth knowing more about.  Fantastic......</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Complicated Plot -- all puns intended"></head><body><p>Spooky. I thought I had figured out what was happening, and so there was no big surprises due, but I was wrong. I had figured out what was discovered somewhere around the middle of the film, but not how it would play out to the end. Not even close. I was probably some confused by tastes of 2001: A Space Odyssey in a couple of plot elements.<br /><br />Anyway, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is alone in the mining operation on the dark side of the moon, if you don't count Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) the computer. Resist the urge to consider him another HAL9000. Gerty has a screen that displays an emoticon to express himself with, including actually having a tear in his eye at one point. Mostly it's just happy face or frowny face, but he has a pretty decent repertoire, actually.<br /><br />The premise is that Sam is near the end of his three-year contract, and eager to get home to his beautiful wife Tess and their adorable daughter Eve. He gets messages from them which cannot be two-way because something is wrong with the communications equipment. He's missing them terribly, looking forward to getting home, when he goes out in the rover to do some routine chore at one of the completely automated mining machines and has a smash-up. Next thing you know, he's waking up in the infirmary and Gerty is explaining that he had an accident, and will need to rest for awhile.<br /><br />And then things get seriously complicated.</p></body></html>

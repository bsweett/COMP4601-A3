<meta name="summary" content="LIFE IN THE SUBURBS OF GHOSTS"></head><body><p>For my money, a much better movie than the other recent underground comic book translation, &quot;American Splendor&quot;. It's about two female high school graduates who bravely confront impending adulthood in the mundane suburbs of California and it is funny without being loud and cynical without being abrasive. Probably a more precise deptction of the teen scene than the current slice of silly cinematic pie, it's a rewarding, funny thoughful film for all concerned.</p></body></html>

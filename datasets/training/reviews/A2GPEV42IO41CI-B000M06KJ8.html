<meta name="summary" content=""This, Madame, is Versailles.""></head><body><p>As the movie opens, a marriage has been arranged for 14-year old Maria Antonia (Kirsten Dunst) of Austria and Louis, the Dauphin of France (Jason Schwartzman).  She is immediately packed off to the court of Versailles where she is the object of suspicion as a foreigner, and her husband is unable or unwilling to consummate their marriage.  Plucky Marie Antoinette manages to quickly adjust to her lavish and pampered lifestyle by indulging in power-shopping and taking a lover.  At the age of 19, she is Queen of France, a mother, and totally unaware of the desperate conditions of the poor in Paris.<br /><br />From the first punk rock tune during the opening credits, I knew this was not going to be a typical historical drama.  Indeed, the soundtrack mixes rock songs with a few classical pieces, creating a quirky, surreal atmosphere.  If you liked the odd mix of a period story with modern music in the movie "Moulin Rouge," you'll like this one.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's easy to feel immersed in court life, where all the nobility had to do all day was dress in stunningly gorgeous outfits, gossip about everyone, and see and be seen.  The costumes are incredibly opulent and much of the filming was done in and around Versailles, so this is a visual feast, to say the least.  I did find it annoying that no mention is ever made of dates and the passage of time (19 years) is vague since the actors don't seem to age.  Dunst is horribly miscast as Marie Antoinette.  She looks and sounds like a mid-west Girl Scout, using words like, "yeah" and "gonna," and generally looking silly amid the sophisticated surroundings.  I give it five stars for the photography and one star for Dunst and the soundtrack, for a score of 3 ***.</p></body></html>

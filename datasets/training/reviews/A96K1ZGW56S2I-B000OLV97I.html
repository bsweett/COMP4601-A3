<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing."></head><body><p>I have not yet read the novel ERAGON (I should get to it in the next month, though), but several of my friends have and many of them were very excited this summer after learning that a movie based upon the book was going to be released in December 2006.  Due to their enthusiasm and because the next Narnia movie won't be released until 2008, I gladly went with the theatre with them to see ERAGON.  I had also seen previews of the movie and it looked promising.  I ended up leaving the theatre disappointed.  What I had seen was a film that was full of promise and potential and could have been a great movie, but instead was a rushed and riddled, hodge-podge of myth, sci-fi, and fantasy clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />ERAGON takes place in world that resembles a middle-aged Earth, but on film looks more like a cheap imitation of THE LORD OF THE RINGS Middle Earth.  Eragon (Edward Speleers) is a young farm boy who lives with his uncle and cousin.  They live in the country, but the kingdom in which they live is ruled by an evil dictator named Galbatorix (John Malkovich).  Galbatorix is the last of the dragon riders.  The dragon riders used to be guardians of justice and agents of peace, but Galbatorix took advantage of fractions within the riders to kill them or their dragons off until he was the last of the dragon riders.  He then took control of the lands he was supposed to protect and killed any who stood in his way.  Much of the resistance was destroyed, but a fragment remained, hidden somewhere in mountains at the edge of the kingdom.  In addition to being the last dragon rider, Galbatorix also has an ally in a Shade named Durza.  Shades are basically magicians with demonic powers.<br /><br />Anyway, one evening while Eragon is hunting he discovers a large, beautiful blue stone.  Thinking he might be able to trade the stone for food he takes it.  It isn't until later that he discovers the stone isn't a stone at all, but is a dragon egg that hatches before his eyes.  The dragon is named Saphira and has selected Eragon as her rider.  Saphira was stolen from King Galbatorix and he's really mad about it.  Once it hatches, he wants Saphira's rider killed because if you kill the rider you kill the dragon. Eragon doesn't realize the peril he is in until a town vagrant named Brom comes to his aid and assist him on a journey to the rebellion stronghold in the mountains.  The return of the dragon riders was prophesized years ago and Eragon suddenly finds himself as a new hope for the fledging resistance.<br /><br />The plot of the movie sounds interesting enough, but the execution of that plot has been done poorly.  Jeremy Irons, Robert Carlyle, John Malkovich, and Djimon Hounsou are all excellent actors but only Irons has any real screen time while the others are basically reduced to playing cameos.  Also, although Irons has a lot of screen time, his character doesn't have anything new or interesting to say.  The actors do their best, but with the writing given to them they come off being as water-downed version of characters from THE LORD OF THE RINGS, STAR WARS, HARRY POTTER, or THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA.<br /><br />Therein lays two of the major problems of the movie.  The writing is pretty lame and the most significant moments of the film seem to be cheap imitations of some of the most memorable fantasy and sci-fi films made.  Remember in LORD OF THE RINGS when Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are escaping the Ring Wraiths by leaving the Shire and crossing the river Brandywine?  That scene is in this movie.  Remember in the original STAR WARS when Obi-Wan Kenobi lets himself be struck down so he can become a part of the force and better help Luke?  That scene is in this movie, too.<br /><br />Another problem with the film is the pacing.  The entire movie runs about ninety minutes.  I couldn't believe the film was over when it ended.  I could tell that many things had been rushed through or totally skipped from the novel and I haven't even read the book, yet.  The movie could have easily been expanded to two or two and a half hours and would probably have been a better picture.  A fantasy film of this magnitude needs time to simmer and fermentate.  It shouldn't be rushed.  I mean, the average children's animated movie runs around ninety minutes now, an epic fantasy adventure should at least be two hours long.<br /><br />The one thing that I was rather impressed by in the film was the dragon.  Since I haven't read the book, yet, I can't say how accurate the film version of Saphira resembles the way she is described in the novel.  What I can say is that Saphira looked very real on screen and is a beautiful creature to behold, fantastical or not.<br /><br />Overall, ERAGON is an average fantasy film that moves at a very rushed pace and never reaches the promise of the great movie it could have been.  I don't blame the director, but I do blame the studio because I know they pressured the filmmakers to finish the movie as fast as they could.  An epic fantasy film shouldn't be filmed in just a month.  Fans of the book might enjoy the movie, but they will probably be disappointed.  Instead, this movie version is more for very young children and those looking for a short, non-original fantasy movie.</p></body></html>

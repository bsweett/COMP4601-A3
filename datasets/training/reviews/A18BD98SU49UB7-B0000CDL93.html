You root for Costner from beginning to end, not because he know's who killed Kennedy, but because of the deep conviction and Gut-Feeling that he think's he know's who killed President Kennedy. That is what the history has become. Not in the books, but in our theories. Mostly fueled by the thing's we cannot see, our fear's about Kennedy's death drove into the creation process of JFK the film. It is First important that you know the fact's about what was assumed to have happened before you allow a hundred different idea's change that view. JFK is great at delivering awesome performances (such as a very long and heated court scene with Costner) and showing a paranoid nation that now remembers exactly what they where doing when John F. Kennedy was killed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Beyond My Expectations"></head><body><p>Michael Clayton is sort of like that throwback to the old 70's political thrillers like "All The President's Men" and watching it, it just gave off that whole feel from the atomosphere to the dialouge to the premise, everything just seemed to echo all those old politics from the 70's. And, for me, this actually works, cause it not only gives us that bit of nostalgic feeling but it also has a way to make the film fresh and not dated.<br /><br />The film's title refers to the main character, Michael Clayton, a 'fixer' at a big time law firm. So essentially, his job is to clean up messes in trials. His next assingment finds himself investigating the seemingly mental breakdown of one of the top attorney's in his firm, Arthur Edens. But, to him, this is no big surprise since Eden's has had a history of mental illness. But ss he investiagtes his clients bizzare behavior, he uncovers something far more sinister going on that may very well affect the very company his firm is backing.<br /><br />What really got me was the first twentey minutes of the film. At first, you think that this is just the starting scene but then, all of a sudden, the tables are turned and you realize this takes place in the future, so essentially after that you begin to wonder 'okay, what happened then? was there some big clues given?' just really getting you to think what on earth happened over those past few days? Not only that but there are a few surprise moments in the film that completly took me by surprise, just so unexpected, and yet if you re-view the movie, you actually see that this was suppose to happen. That's the other thing about this film, the script is just so labyrinth that you really have to view it a second time to get a full grasp of the situation.<br /><br />Now, all the perfomers in this do supurb. George Clooney was just as great as ever, doing a very well controled performence that really detaches him from that suave and savvy George we know more of. Tom Wilkinson is great in his role as the unstable attorny, never once going overboard and Tilda Swinton pulls of the right combination of obsesive preperation and icy chill to produce a very subtle yet chlling villianess.<br /><br />In response to the Oscars, and this is my own opinion. As much as I love Tilda, I don't feel she should have won the Oscar (She should have been nominated for her role as the White Witch). For me, that honer should have gone to Cate Blanchett, who I think did a far superior job in her role. But I will give Swinton this and that is she had the best acceptance speech of the night. No other speech was as funny, witty, and just plain cool as her's, so she gets MY Oscar for best acceptance speech by an actor or actress.<br /><br />But besides that, Michael Clayton really is that great thriller you just don't see that often in theaters. It not only gets you to think but by the end, it really can just lift your spirit.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fine send-off for the comic book-based franchise"></head><body><p>As one that doesn't have the knowledge of the characters via the comic book, I think that I look at each X-Men film with a less-biased eye.  That having been said, I find the third installment to be the most entertaining of the lot - and that's some praise from one that thought the second film was excellent.<br /><br />This time out, there are so many characters (mutant and human) that it was obvious that some of the returning characters, like Anna Paquin (Rogue) and James Marsden (Cyclops) would have less screen time.  It is also obvious that Jackman, Berry, and McKellan are the stars, with Stewart doing nothing more than a "death scene" cameo.  As others have stated, Kelsey Grammer steals the show as "Beast," with Vinnie Jones running a close second as "Juggernaut".<br /><br />It's also good to see stage, screen, and television Michael Murphy in the role of Warren Worthington II, creator of the "cure" for the mutant gene.<br /><br />The dialogue is equal to the second and superior to the first.  Special effects are outstanding, especially of Magneto shifting The Golden Gate Bridge and Dark Phoenix's (Famke Janssen) assault on Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay.<br /><br />The action is crisp and each actor does get his/her "moment," no matter how brief.<br /><br />There are a few complaints: the absence of Jim Cummings' marvelous "Nightcrawler" and the beautiful Rebecca Romijn's early departure from the story line.  Both actors deserved better than this, after their impressive turns in the first two films.<br /><br />Also, the inevitable battle between "Ice Man" (Shawn Ashmore) and "Pyro" (Aaron Stafford) was a bit of a letdown, lasting less than a minute, in my estimate.<br /><br />That withstanding, if in fact this is the last in the series (save a Wolverine franchise), it still delivers and all that had a hand in its production have much for which they can be proud.</p></body></html>

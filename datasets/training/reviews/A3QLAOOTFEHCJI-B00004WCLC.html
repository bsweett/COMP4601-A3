<meta name="summary" content="A brilliant messy stew with stellar performances"></head><body><p>Director/writer/producer Paul Thomas Anderson delivered this Christmas present to critics and filmgoers in 1999 with his follow-up to the successful "Boogie Nights."  Many of the same cast members reappear here, in what could be described as a messy stew of mostly unlikable characters.  Anderson's sense of filmmaking tends to mimic some of Robert Altman's best films ("Short Cuts", "Nashville" come to mind) in which an ensemble cast with little connection cross paths in unexpected ways.<br /><br />Anderson sets the stage at the beginning showing what appear to be newsreel clips of unusual and coincidental events from the 1940's.  In one of the film's story lines, an old man (Jason Robards) lies dying in his home, full of cancer.  His much younger wife (Julianne Moore) who had married him for his money is now prescription drug dependent and remorseful as he nears death.  The man's estranged son (Tom Cruise in an Oscar nominated performance) is a televangelist-like motivational speaker whose pitch is to convince men they can sexually exploit women.  Another pairing is Claudia (Melora Walters) as a cocaine addict who gets a visit from a cop (John C. Reilly) who lacks self-confidence in his personal and professional life.  Phillip Baker Hall is an aging game show host who just learned he is also dying of cancer.  He's also the father of Claudia.  One of the game show contestants is boy of about 12 (Jeremy Blackman), brilliant and controlled by an overbearing father.  A previous contestant who became famous (William H. Macy) is now nearly broke and contemplates robbing his former employer.<br /><br />The film is full of stellar performances throughout.  Watch Cruise as Frank Mackey when his cocky banter with a female journalist devolves into total silence as she probes his early life.  Check out Robards as the dying TV executive when he confesses to his caretaker (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) his many regrets regarding his family.  The always remarkable Moore stews in a scene where the pharmacists question her need for the strong narcotics she is getting at a drug store.  The film is certainly not without controversy and humor as many of the events seem so random and unlikely, but go back to the opening.<br /><br />Then there is the final act and the now iconic "rain of frogs."  What does it mean?  Well, I'm not sure.  There is the biblical passage out of Exodus where God speaks of this event if the "slaves" are not allowed to leave with Moses.  Are the "slaves" the children being exploited in the film?  Perhaps the best answer is the closing seen where young Stanley (Blackman) sits in a library during the frog falling and says "This happens.  This is something that happens."  Probably just as much as the cast singing over Aimee Mann's "Save Me" in individual scenes.  Anything might happen on Magnolia Street.</p></body></html>

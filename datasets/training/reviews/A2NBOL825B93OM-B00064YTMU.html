<meta name="summary" content="A guy's night out: Fun with Max and Vincent"></head><body><p>Max (Jamie Foxx) has been a "temporary" taxi driver for the past 12 years, just waiting for things to "get in to shape" as he tries to save enough money to start his own limo-business. He's lonely, he's afraid to commit and he has a sick mother in the hospital. Suddenly, Vincent (Tom Cruise) enters his cab and Max has no option but to drive through the LA night as Vincent, a contract-killer, starts to murder the five witnesses to a narcotics process.<br /><br />"Collateral" has its weakest points in the script, with some major holes that can't be overlooked, and in the development of "the bad guy", played by Tom Cruise. I mean, Vincent must be the dumbest, worst (yet luckiest) contract killer alive in the world. Not that Cruise isn't good in the movie, he is - at least he shows some effort at trying to be good in a role that is different from everything he has done until today. The movie's strongest points are the excepcional direction by Michael Mann, and Jamie Foxx.<br /><br />Michael Mann wanted to do a thriller. And he did it, with a capital T. "Collateral" has some very strong moments, leaving the viewer tense for most of the time. The script doesn't have logic or continnuity problems (as could have been expected, because the plot spans only twelve hours or so of the same night), but some parts treat the viewer's intelligence with disrespect. Jamie Foxx, strong in comedies, proves to be a very resourceful and convincing actor, carrying most of the weight of the movie on his back. The final 15 or 20 minutes contain a plot-twist that is not unexpected (but not too obvious either) and provide the best moments of the movie. Jada Pinkett also rises above the expected supporting role she's supposed to play.<br /><br />"Collateral" is one more above-average movie by Michael Mann, one of the (few) trully innovative directors in today's Hollywood.<br /><br />Grade 8.2/10</p></body></html>

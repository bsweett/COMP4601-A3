REQUIEM FOR A DREAM follows four desperate addicts on their journey into self-annihilating oblivion. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn from THE EXORCIST) lives a lonely, solitary life, trapped in the dull routine of growing old and dying. Her dream of being on television (her only companion) seems to be answered when a phonecall tells her that she has been chosen to appear on a gameshow. There's only one problem. Sara no longer fits into her red dress! Thus begins the torture of dieting, which leads to pills, addiction, and ultimate destruction. Sara's son (Jared Leto from AMERICAN PSYCHO, PANIC ROOM) is a heroin addict (among other substances). He and his friend (Marlon Wayans) just want to make that final "big score" so they can "go straight". Unfortunately, life just doesn't work that way. Marian (Jennifer Connelly from DARK CITY, HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG) is the addicted girlfriend. Her dream of turning her dress designs into a career is torched by her own hunger for various pills and powders. This is the story of human weakness in the face of overwhelming temptation. When watching this, I was constantly reminded of my own flaws, and the fact that human beings, in mind or body, just aren't made for the abuses we inflict on them. When you see the price that these people are willing to pay, you'll see what I mean...<br /><br />P.S.- This review is for the unrated, non-edited, complete version of DREAM. Don't ask me why I reviewed the edited version...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="what's wrong with people, this movie rocked!"></head><body><p>Seriously people are becoming quite picky with movies nowadays. This remake of the original wicker man stars Nicolas cage as a police officer looking for a missing child in a town called summersile. In this mysterious town everyone is acting strange as if they are involved in the child's kidnap. anyway i don't want to ruin anything else but I got to admit this movie was quite good. not better than the original but quite effective. And not to mention the awesome twist ending. The only thing i disliked was the theatrical cut, which removed a lot of important scenes. And the theatrical has a different ending which kind of kills the movie. So make sure to watch the unrated version instead. Rent it<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ? OUT OF 5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Two Rascals and a Goddess!"></head><body><p>Billy Wilder (1906-2002) was very versatile and successful as film director and screenplay writer. In both capacities he won the Oscar award more than once.<br />No matter what film genre he tried, he delivered a remarkable opus.<br />He had filmed many outstanding comedies as "The 7th Year Itch" (1955), "The Apartment" (1961) and "Irma la Douce" (1963); also deep human drama as "Sunset Blvd" (1951) or a WWII German POW camp "Stalag 17" (1953).<br />Almost all of them were big box office hit at their release.<br /><br />Obviously Wilder had the knack for comedic genre. The three films above mentioned and the present one are more than eloquent support of this quality.<br /><br />The story is as follows: in 1929 two innocent musicians involuntary see mobsters massacring mobsters. The killers try to eliminate them as dangerous witness.<br />So Joe & Jerry are on the run. They desperately look for a way to evade Chicago and save their skins. Miraculously there is a Girls Orchestra departing for Miami and two members suddenly desert them. Joe & Jerry quickly mutate to Josephine & Daphne and join the gang.<br />An unforgettable ride starts then and there. Sequences on the train connecting Chicago & Miami are anthological.<br />Joe/Josephine falls in love with sculptural singer Sugar Kane, but he is a "she" and barred to propose openly, so a tantalizing game is engaged.<br />Parallel to these events Daphne/Jerry is courted by a millionaire infatuated by "her" charms.<br />Crowning all this madness the Mob move into Miami for a Convention, doggedly followed by Detective Mulligan and the "witness hunt" reassume.<br /><br />Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Joe E. Brown give their best, building one of the best cinematographic comedies of all times!<br />George Raft as the classic Boss and Pat O'Brien as the Detective make their contribution.<br />I must make a special mention to the more than good black & white photography delivered by Charles Lang, who was eighteen times Oscar nominated and only once awarded between 1931 and 1973.<br /><br />If you like comedies do not let this one pass by!<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

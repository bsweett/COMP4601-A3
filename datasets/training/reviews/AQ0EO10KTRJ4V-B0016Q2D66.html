<meta name="summary" content="Good acting carries an otherwise lame story"></head><body><p>Only the talents of DiCaprio and Kate Winslet keep this story watchable.<br />Otherwise it is a lame story.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this movie keeps hammering the point that the 1950's were not really as wonderful as portrayed in classic shows like Andy Griffith and Happy Days.<br />The film also attempts to portray the American Dream and Suburban living as a lie and a depressing prison.<br /><br />Okay ..... we all know the "good old days" were not as pure and innocent as Happy Days ------ BUT, at the other extreme -------- neither were they as depressing and jaded as Revolutionary Road.<br />Unless of course you were dysfunctional and mentally unstable and generally negative about living.<br /><br />This film attempts to send a message that the good life of the 1950s was all a lie of fake smiles, depressions, frustration and harmful materialism.<br /><br />The characters in this film have a nice home in a quiet neighborhood, recently were chosen for a promotion and a raise, take vacations at the beach, etc..etc..etc..<br /><br />The wife is in perpetual misery because her dream is to toss all this aside and go slum it up in Paris.<br />In the process she acts like a miserable person on the edge of a mental breakdown.<br /><br />Her husband is no angel, but he certainly puts up with more of her whacky unstable behaviour than most would put up with.<br /><br />The movie tries to hard to demonize the rise of middle class suburban living in America and offer a derivative view of life in the 1950s era.<br /><br />The facts are not matter what time in history you examine, you will find people who are both happy and others who are miserable.<br /><br />That is no different today than it was then.<br /><br />However, having lived in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and today ....... I DO believe life in America was better 20-30 years ago.<br /><br />And while there is no time in human history that is perfect (nothing involving people ever will be) ... I can certainly say living in the 70s and 80s in America was better than what we are experiencing today with the direction this Country is heading.</p></body></html>

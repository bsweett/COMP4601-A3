<meta name="summary" content="It Speaks for Itself"></head><body><p>Jack Nicholson has a certain character down pat, and has played that character with variations for the last decade.  When Jack Nicholson plays obsessive-compulsive Melvin Udall, a reclusive writer with a routine so set that even the most minor deviation causes mental anguish, the results are continuously hilarious.<p>To be funny Jack requires other good actors, and in this movie Jack gets Helen Hunt as waitress and love interest Carol Connelly, Greg Kinnear as alternate lifestyle artist Simon Bishop, Cuba Gooding as Greg's agent Frank Sachs, and a wonderful little dog named Verdell.<p>As you would expect Melvin holds rigid opinions about everyone and everything.  Fortunately he rarely has to interface with anyone at length, so his unreserved comments about others rarely offend others to the point where they refuse to deal with him, or worse, hit him.  However, two events conspire to force Melvin to change.<p>First, Simon is beat up by a group of men robbing his house.  Someone has to take care of Verdell the dog, and Melvin is forced into taking care of Verdell by Cuba Gooding.  At first Melvin is completely unable to tolerate the dog, but the dog slowly wins Melvin over, putting a small chink into Melvin's curmudgeon armor.<p>The second event that upsets Melvin's rigid life is that Carol misses a day of work.  Melvin must be served by Carol or his breakfast routine just is not right.  Melvin finds Carol at her house and discovers that she is being kept at home by her sick son.  Not letting anything stand in his way, Melvin arranges for a doctor to take care of Carol's son.  As Melvin gets to know Carol better, her opinion of him starts to matter, and Melvin finds that he is falling in love with Carol.  I leave the rest of this story to the viewer.<p>It is easy to find fault with Jack Nicholson in this role because this role was his with little or no effort.  However, it matters not that this role fits with Jack Nicholson's character so well that you would think Jack is just like his character in real life, what matters is that Jack is perfectly believable.  The change that we see in Jack throughout this movie and the interactions with the various characters that brings about this change is the heart of this movie.  That watching the change is humorous and makes you feel good is just that much more benefit.<p>This movie is the rare funny, feel good movie that makes you want to watch it again.  Perhaps the theme is just a bit trite, but we all want to believe in the core good of all people.  Watch this movie and enjoy the easy smile it puts on your face.</p></body></html>

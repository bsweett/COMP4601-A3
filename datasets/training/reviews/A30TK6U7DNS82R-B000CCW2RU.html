However, this is America and we're allowed to see any old pap we want to, so I paid my money and took a chance on this film.  I'm glad I did because this was truly a spellbinding thriller that had me on the edge of my seat a good two hours.<br /><br />And yet I can see why some disliked it.  I'm of two minds about the  constant product placement.  To me it seemed to give some backing to the theory that Michael Bay, improbable as it may seem, was building a case against unbridled capitalism, by the mere thickness of the web of logos that the viewer must struggled through, like his clones have to struggle through phalanx after phalanx of black-garbed security men to find freedom.  I never really thought about it much beyond that, however, look at a book like Bret Easton Ellis' GLAMORAMA, in which much of the horror is in fact contingent on the relentless dropping of brand names, drop by drop like the so-called Chinese water torture.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson do just fine playing their parts.  I thought Scarlett more appealing in this film then in any other. I loved the part where Ewan approaches her, despite the limits on "proximity" and whispers something into her ear in a visual reminiscence of the final scene in LOST IN TRANSLATION, where Bill Murray tells her something the audience never hears, the import of which we try to guess by studying her reaction.<br /><br />People are wondering why this movie didn't do better upon opening.  I think it's because it's hard to understand!  Well, if you keep at it you get it, and there are some exposition scenes later on that manage to avoid tedium, but for the first half hours I was just one big "Huh?" scratching my head like Elmer Fudd.  There was plenty to look at, but I can see how it would be confusing for many, and word of mouth might have suffered.  Caspian Tredwell-Owen's screenplay was miles better than his last fil;m, BEYOND BORDERS with Angelina Jolie, and I look forward to seeing what comes out of his head next.<br /><br />We couldn't figure out how the women in the sector, many of whom are about to give birth, actually got pregnant!  I felt like a child again before I knew anything about sex.  How did the women understand what pregnancy was about?  I guess they were just told they had been inseminated for the good of the race.<br /><br />In fact, as we walked away from the tremendous ball of excitement that is THE ISLAND, loose ends began piling around our feet ike seaweed.  Picking our way around them, we went home happy as idiots.  Haven't had as fun a time in the movies all summer.</p></body></html>

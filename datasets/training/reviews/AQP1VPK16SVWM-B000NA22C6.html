<meta name="summary" content="Predictable but enjoyable"></head><body><p>Johnny Depp's deft performance as a writer threatened by a &quot;fan&quot; for stealing his work makes &quot;Secret Window&quot; a worthwhile film to watch.  etween the exceptional support by the rest of the cast and the sharp direction by writer/director David Koepp, &quot;Secret Window&quot; manages to transcend the limitations of Stephen King's fine if predictable novella from &quot;Nightmares and Dreamscapes&quot;. In this case, style triumphs over substance as Koepp and his collaborators invest &quot;Secret Window&quot; with enough visual invention for three movies.<p>The film looks marvelous on DVD. The various featurettes about the making of the movie includes some of the previsualization footage allowing you to see how Koepp's carefully orchestrated direction adds to the tension of the film. We also get to see some of the footage that Depp shot with rehearsal footage, outtakes, and actual footage that was redubbed. Why is that important? Well Depp breaks into impersonation mode doing Brando, DeNiro and a whole host of other actors as he works his way through the character. The commentary track by Koepp is particularly revealing as he discusses why he chose not to go with the alternate ending (it's included as an extra) and some of the visualization choices he made as a director and writer.<p>While &quot;Secret Window&quot; comes across as a tad predictable, the exceptional performances from the entire cast and the directing choices Koepp makes certainly keeps this glimpse into someone else's secret window. With a high definition transfer and a nicely arranged 5.1 mix, &quot;Secret Window&quot; makes for an entertaining DVD.</p></body></html>

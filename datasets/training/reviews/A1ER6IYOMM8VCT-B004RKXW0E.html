<meta name="summary" content="THE END?..TO QUITE POSSIBLY THE GREATEST TRILOGY OF ALL TIME!"></head><body><p>I know that title will stir up some controversy, but I can not think of a more consistent trilogy that has gotten better with each installment with the third film being the best of all! Pixar has done it again and is really starting to show up the competition with their latest classic animated tale Toy Story 3. What a track record!, Have these guys ever bombed? .....OK Andrew let's just leave Cars out of this! ;-D ....it's not that bad, just not as good as their greatest works.<br /><br />Pixar's Toy Story 3 is really a beautiful film to behold, both visually and metaphorically. I've shed more tears watching their animated films than most live action films combined in recent years. I guess the original Toy Story being somewhat crude by today's animation standards only had one way to go, up! That doesn't mean it was an easy task, but it is the one that started it all and put Pixar on the map. To improve on the original in the sequels, things like expectations and topping what they did last time have to be carefully balanced and of course the story must include a believable growth of the characters.<br /><br />It is all these areas that Toy Story 3 succeeds with flying colors! It's an incredible film that is both funny and heartfelt. One of the great things about this series is the nostalgic aspect, remembering all those cool toys and the in jokes that only adults will get. I do think this film is rather intense for younger kids at times, but most of the great one are. These films are really made with adults in mind which in nothing new to animation. Disney classic and Bugs Bunny cartoons where always constructed for adults as most kids wouldn't get half the jokes in them anyway.<br /><br />This is something for parents to consider before they let their kids see this or any other film like it. I know I grew up watching Pinocchio and Bambi and I never felt traumatized by them and they are some of the most frightening animated films out there....the same could be said about Finding Nemo which has some very scary scenes in it.<br /><br />Since parents tend to shield children from this stuff nowadays, well........ the choice it yours, but I don't think shielding them from this stuff is protecting them....that doesn't mean any of this stuff is meant for 3 year olds. The same case can be made for PC versions of these and other cartoons. I think having open discussions with children rather than hiding life's negatives is a much better solution.<br /><br />The four disc edition is loaded with interesting goodies and of course the film is included  in formats Blu Ray, DVD and Digital copy, which all look exceptional.</p></body></html>

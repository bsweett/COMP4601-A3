<meta name="summary" content="THE BAD CHECK'S IN THE MAIL"></head><body><p>This film builds in entertainment value as it skips merrily along and possesses an unnerving quality, sure to upset the con in all of us, regarding true life famed forger Frank Abagnale Jr. being globally cornered and doggedly pursued by a determined and obsessed FBI agent. Director Steven Spielberg pictures an upscale, conservative and gaudy side of the 1960s, and DiCaprio is more than convincing as the gifted scam artist, who as Spielberg suggests, is only trying to find his way back home. Clever and amusing "Pink Panther" -like musical score by John Williams helps keep this criminal act a light-hearted affair.</p></body></html>

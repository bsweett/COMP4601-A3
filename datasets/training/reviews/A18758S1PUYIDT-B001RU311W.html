<meta name="summary" content="Some loose ends, but an interesting tale"></head><body><p>This biopic by Gus Van Sant gave me some info on Harvey Milk, his rise to political power, his activism within the gay community, and his untimely demise.  Penn, Hirsch, Pill, and Brolin were all well chosen for their parts, and they even physically resemble the people they portray.  It's also a look back at the turbulence and fashion of the 1970s, with disco, wide ties, funny hairstyles, and big cars.<br /><br />There are some loose ends that left me wanting a bit more.  Who was the young fellow in the wheelchair that we only saw a couple of times?  Was he a real person or some kind of symbol?  Why didn't the James Franco character stay with Milk?  Why did Jack choose to exit in a very dramatic and upsetting way?  Since the Twinkie defense makes no sense as a motive for killing someone, what was Dan White's beef with Milk other than his political rivalry and losses?  Was Dan gay and in the closet and therefore jealous of Milk in more than one way?<br />I also found some of the music rather distracting, but that's more of a personal quirk.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="FRANK DARABONT, OPUS 6"></head><body><p>**1/2 2007. Based on Stephen King's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451223292">The Mist (Previously Published as a Novella in 'Skeleton Crew')</a> and written and directed by Frank Darabont. Dozens of customers are being trapped in a supermarket when a strange fog covers up their town. They finally find out that alien animals are hidden in the mist. Stupid monster movie that uses all the genre clich&eacute;s and is, in the end, just a rip-off of George Romero's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UR9QIK">Dawn of the Dead [Blu-ray</a>]. If you're looking for a genuine monster movie, take a look at Joon-ho Bong's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PKG8TW">The Host (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>. This one is already forgotten.</p></body></html>

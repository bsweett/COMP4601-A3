<meta name="summary" content="One of the Most Frightening Films of All Time!!!!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>This is a near perfect Horror movie.  When an American research crew stationed in Antarctica come across an alien craft buried for eons in the ice trouble ensues that makes special effects history.  The overt creep factor in this movie is so oppressive that watching it alone requires practicing putting the tape in my VCR, it's that scary!  I have to get up the courage to watch this movie!  The alien creature and all the gory happenings surrounding its presence are so firmly imprinted in my mind that it's kind of like recalling a &quot;nice&quot; trauma.  The cast is superb, the direction spectacular.  This is the movie that should have put John Carpenter on the map, not Halloween.  It's much more intense than any mask wielding madman.  The idea of an unstoppable enemy, an enemy that one cannot identify until it is much too late is such a bone-chilling concept and it is pulled off with a magician's flair.  So if you have a fear of the dark, of death in a horrible fashion, or of never being able to trust anyone, well here's the movie for you.  Guaranteed chills and glances over your shoulder with each viewing!</p></body></html>

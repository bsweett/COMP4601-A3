<meta name="summary" content="THE SCORPION KING ain't art, but still fun."></head><body><p>Basically a spin-off of the greatly successful MUMMY movies, THE SCORPION KING tells the story of an Akadian assassin (Dwayne Johnson AKA The Rock), who defeats an evil warlord and becomes the powerful Scorpion King.  Borrowing from genres as old as Conan the Barbarian, this is an old fashioned sword and sorcery flick that, while it might not be art, still has more than its share of entertainment.  The Rock has a solid screen presence and makes a credible action hero in the title role, while Kelly Hu is lovely as the sorceress who captures his heart.  Of course, there are the obligitory sidekicks and fellow warriors, including the always dependable Michael Clarke Duncan as a Nubian warrior. At about 90 minutes, the film moves at a brisk pace and doesn't allow one to dwell too much on the obvious absurdities that too many films of this type may have.  Having said that, THE SCORPION KING makes for a fun flick for those who love their action epics with a big helping of cheese.  Recommended for those who love action films and have a good sense of humor.</p></body></html>

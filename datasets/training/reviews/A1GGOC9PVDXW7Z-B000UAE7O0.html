And especially... don't shoot me.""></head><body><p>This unimaginably gory Robert Rodriguez frighter is produced by Quentin Tarantino.<br /><br />Zombies, violence, castration, amputations, brainless heads, splooshing suppurating pustules, splattering, shattering bullet wounds, and that's just in the first half-hour!<br /><br />Good production values but totally depraved. Loved it!<br /><br />Includes optional audience reaction track. (Watch for Tarantino's incredible death scene.)<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.5) Planet Terror (2007) - Josh Brolin/Bruce Willis/Michael Parks/Rose McGowan/Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez/Jeff Fahey/Cheech Marin/Quentin Tarantino</p></body></html>

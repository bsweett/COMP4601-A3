<meta name="summary" content="Borat  over rated and under funny"></head><body><p>Apparently I missed something in this film because I only found it mildly funny.  In fact the audience that attended the same performance I did hardly laughed at all and this included several college age boys sitting nearby.  While some people laughed (as did I) there were no knee slappers. However the reviewers here all think this was a hilarious film.  I was not offended by it, I just didn't think it was funny.<br /><br />Borat is basically a series of Saturday Night Live skits loosely connected, much like Talledaga Nights, but Talledaga was actually hilarious.  In this film, which is a pseudo documentary the people he encounters are not actors but he deliberately pushes them by his rude behavior to react.  His personal conduct is appalling and cannot be excused on the basis of cultural differences.  He accosts people in New York who react negatively to his attempts at friendliness.  Having personally been accosted by various nuts in large cities I didn't find their reactions to be unusual.  Watching a bunch of college boys get drunk and make fools of themselves didn't strike me as especially funny and the college kids sitting near me apparently didn't either because this skit didn't get any laughs and only a few chuckles.  Of course some of the anti-semitic skits were funny - especially the bed and breakfast scene but these never reached the level of Mel Brooks's treatment of the same subject. Nevertheless because of the few real laughs in this movie I gave it two stars, but overall I thought it was rather dull and as it wore on --  less and less funny. Plus there were scenes that I thought didn't especially fit other than to shock the audience.  The masturbation scenes were sort of funny but to what purpose? The same was true of the nude wrestling scene -- sort of funny but what was the point and how did it fit into a "documentary"?  I felt that making fun of people who were sincerely trying to help -- the Christian scene -- showed appalling bad manners and whose only purpose seemed to be to make fun of the people.  The same was true of the dinner party.  The Americans were trying to accomodate Borat but he continued to insult them until they reacted.  Would you have acted differently if a guest in your home was as rude and insulting?  Why was this supposed to be funny?  Not one laugh in the audience.  In fact this film is getting great reviews from Hollywood and New York but then those are the people who think the typical American is some sort of yahoo.<br /><br />I realize I am in the minority because I thought this film was only mildly funny and hardly worth the money.  I would say -- don't bother -- its all hype and not much comedic substance.</p></body></html>

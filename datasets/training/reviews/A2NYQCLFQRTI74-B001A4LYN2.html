<meta name="summary" content="excellent"></head><body><p>The story of an oilman, Daniel Plainview.<br /><br />Splendid performances by Daniel-Day Lewis and Paul Dano, who is very convincing as a preacher.<br />Beautiful cinematography by Robert Elswit.<br />My hats off to the producers, who took a risk in producing this film, and to the scriptwriters who did outstanding work in adapting the book Oil by Upton Sinclair - even if they didn't respect the book 100%, the final product is a great movie.<br /><br />I certainly didn't expect this film to be this excellent. Recommended viewing to all.</p></body></html>

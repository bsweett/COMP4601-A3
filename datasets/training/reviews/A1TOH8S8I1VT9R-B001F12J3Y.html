<meta name="summary" content="Lots of "WOW!!!"  and  "Hmm?". Altogether a Compelling view."></head><body><p>A lot of good reviews (positive and nagative) concerning this film.  the detractors find some good and the supporters find some flaw.  To me, that makes sense.  In a nut-shell this is a film full of "WOW!!" moments with enough flaws to make you go "Hmmm?".  I won't nitpick the story.  It's compelling enough.  Probably more danger than I'd like to see a nine-year-old face, but that's part of what makes it compelling.  What I do nit-pick is the overall "feal" of the film.  Sometimes it's spine chilling...  ... and sometimes just chilling.  Here's a list of the things that made me go "WOW" and "Hmmm?"....<br /><br />WOW!!!<br />-The overall texture of the film is mind-boggling.  I'd need to see it 20 time to appreciate every detail the artist have included.<br />-The train.  I love trains, and this depiction is just awesome.  Never watch this without, AT LEAST, a decent home theater.  the sound penetrates you.<br />-The flying ticket scene.  A great, uncut sequence.  I think I like it so much because no people are involved for most of it.<br />-The last perils before reaching the North Pole are riveting.  Unfortunately it is literally down hill from there.<br />-"Santa Claus is Coming to Town" is a spine tingling moment.<br />-The overall scale of things is pretty impressive, but....<br /><br />Hmmm?<br />-Things are sometimes so big they are forboding or even down-right scary.  The Northpole is a big and scary place.<br />-The elfs are creepy.  Most have bad skin and razor stubble.  They could also use Hermee to fix there teeth.<br />-You may have heard, Santa is a bit wierd looking. All of the character move in an unatural way and the insides of their mouths are spooky and mysterious.  And then there's those lifeless eyes....<br />-This is picky, but nicely rendered as everything is, why could'nt they make the facial hair NOT look like it was glued on?<br />That bugged me throughout the film.<br />-Steven Tyler makes the scariest elf of them all.  Really out of place.<br />-Overall, the film fealt populated by zombies.  The dancing waiters were the strangest of all.<br /><br />Dispite these "little" comlaints, I'd have to advise seeing this film.  It had enough magic to make it compelling, and enough excitement to shake your nerves.  My 2 year old son (a train freek with an ear infection) made it about 3/4 through until they stopped showing the train.  Then he cried allot.  We took him out and he cried to get back in.  So, we stood on the side and held him through the last 20 minutes of the film.  The point is, scary as stuff was, he liked it and I enjoyed it too.  And forget the book.  The only thing you'll see from the book is the beginning and the end,  come to think of it, that is the book!</p></body></html>

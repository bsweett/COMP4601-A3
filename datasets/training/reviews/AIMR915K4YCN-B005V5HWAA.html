<meta name="summary" content="4-Sided Triangle..."></head><body><p>Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) is a successful executive, a wonderful husband / father, and a serial-murdering monster. He has stopped killing for two whole years, but his murdering self, named Marshall (William Hurt) just won't leave things alone. Earl is a member of AA, dutifully chanting the serenity prayer whenever the urge to slaughter innocent victims takes hold. Alas, Marshall is strong and persistent. He's also extremely convincing. Earl falls off the wagon, murdering a young couple in their bedroom. The "fingerprint killer" has struck again. MR. BROOKS is a fascinating peek into the mental struggles of an addict, using serial murder as the addiction. It is also a fine thriller w/ pitch black humor in it's soul. Demi Moore is the ultra-determined cop on Brooks' trail. She WILL catch him, no matter what it takes. Dane Cook is Mr. Smith, the serial-killer wannabe who thinks he's got Brooks right where he wants him. Can Brooks / Marshall outwit these bothersome pests? Will Earl ever find peace and true happiness? Watch and see! Marg Helgenberger (Species 1 and 2, tv's CSI) plays the oblivious Mrs. Brooks, and Danielle Panabaker (Friday The 13th) is the daughter who just might have some secrets of her own. Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

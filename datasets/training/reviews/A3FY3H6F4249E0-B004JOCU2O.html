<meta name="summary" content="Runaway Train/Potential Disaster"></head><body><p>This was a very enjoyable movie.  Although it seemed to get just a tiny bit slow in the first half, it still kept me tied to the screen.  The conductor of a train makes a stupid mistake and leaves a moving train for just a second.  The internal switches slip and it becomes a runaway train, gradually increasing speeds.  It just so happens that there are several cars of a toxic substance on the runaway train.<br /><br />Denzel Washington plays a veteran train engineer (of 28 years I think) who knows the tricks of the trade that you cannot find in books.  Chris Pine (of Star Trek) plays a young conductor.<br /><br />Realistically, I don't know why they could not have fixed the situation earlier in the movie, except that it was written in the script that way.  STILL, I enjoyed it.  It also touches on dumb management decisions, management arrogance, and the stupidity of a company wanting to get rid of older, experienced workers so they can hire younger ones (probably at a lower salary and less benefits).<br /><br />The plot takes place in Pennsylvania and is said to be based on true events.</p></body></html>

Well, for one thing the writing is atrocious--thinly disguised, formulaic soapers with a few "F" words and whoopee cushion jokes thrown in to justify the length and venue. Characterization is nil--apparently a viewer's prior familiarity with the on-screen personas is considered sufficient--and plots are mono-dramatic situations used as excuses for lame (and loud) verbal and sight gags.<br /><br /> In the case of "Anchorman" the title says it all. Ferrell plays a vain and fatuous television news anchor whose chief attribute is his hair, which is suddenly under threat by a foxy woman rival with both brains and hair (no matter that the sexist situations and dialogue are at least 30 years out of date). For no reason other than dramatic necessity the two competitive anchors get their act together both romantically and professionally by the end of the movie (which came 60 minutes too late for this viewer).<br /><br /> Just to show you how short this film is on creative ideas, the highlight for me was the voice-over narration supplied by CBS and cable news commentator Bill Kurtis. A close second would be a 5-second out-take from "Smokey and the Bandit Part 2." A 3rd would be Tim Robbins' walk-on as a ruthlessly ambitious PBS rep.<br /><br /> I'll be curious to to see how well this film does. Pre-college kids probably won't get the political humor of the opening sketches; college kids couldn't care less; adults find SNL humor, at least since the Belushi-Akroyd days, way beneath them. I have a hunch the makers of this film might wish they had chosen to invest their money in something like "Fear Factor: The Movie."<br /><br /> I'm giving the film 3 stars because of Farrell's great comedic potential (he's actually a pretty good musician and dancer) and because he mercifully spared us that noxious cheerleading bit, which is as unfunny as any SNL sketch I've ever seen. Also, his "in character" interviews in promoting the film were so subtle he had me believing I was watching some of the anchormen from my youth in northern Wisconsin. Finally, the only other spectator in the theater--my wife--claimed that she liked the movie.</p></body></html>

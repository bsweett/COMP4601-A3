<meta name="summary" content="Life, Death and Resurrection?"></head><body><p>This is a hard film to see and understand, nevertheless is outstanding and deserves to be seen.<br />Film director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has developed a complex, tasty and compromised "film d'art". We may trace different stylistic influences on this movie: Quentin Tarantino's (Pulp Friction) non linear time sequence and some touches of Kieslowski's (The Double Life of Veronique) casual but most meaningful encounters between different characters.<br />Inarritu transforms an ordinary everyday issue in a strange, tangled and puzzling drama.<br /><br />The story is as follows: there is a sick mathematician waiting for a heart transplant as last resort to survive; there is an ex-con trying to make a new clean life for him and his family; there is a family father taking care of his daughters. Tragedy and fate reunite all these elements into a griping tale.<br /><br />Main actress and actors in the film perform greatly.<br />Sean Penn, as the feeble hearted mathematician, is able to express and transmit the anguish of nearly dying man. Afterwards he shows the compulsive need to find who his donor was.<br />Benicio Del Toro, as the ex-con, presents a very convincing mask of a tormented man trying to overcome his addictions and drawbacks in order to have a new opportunity.<br />Last but not least, Naomi Watts, as the widow of the donor, gives a performance full of subtleties.<br /><br />Viewing this movie in DVD gives the unique opportunity to go back to previous scene when you get lost.<br />This picture is tasty dish for movie fans. Enjoy!<br /> Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

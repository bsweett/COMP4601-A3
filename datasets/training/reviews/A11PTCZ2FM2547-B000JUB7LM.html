<meta name="summary" content="A Boxing Film That's Actually Tender"></head><body><p>MILLION DOLLAR BABY has to be one of the saddest movies I've ever seen--so sad that if I catch it on cable I find myself changing the channel before the tragedy strikes.  That said, this is an acutely tender, compelling drama, featuring three very believable characters in an unusual setting:  women's boxing.  And of course, this is a film directed by Clint Eastwood, who has become one of the elites of even elite filmmakers.<br /><br />We all know the story.  An impoverished waitress (Hilary Swank) wants to be a champion boxer; as her mentor, she wants grizzled, veteran manager Frankie Dunn (Eastwood).  Yet Frankie resists, and resists aggressively, as he wants no part of women's boxing, yet Maggie (Swank's character) persists.  Plus, she touches a nerve in the old, wily manager, a parental nerve in a lonely man who is very much estranged from his own daughter.  Aided by Frankie's longtime friend and partner Eddie (Morgan Freeman), the duo achieves skyrocketing success along the women's boxing circuit--until unspeakable tragedy takes place.  And then Frankie is faced with some very difficult decisions.<br /><br />Believability.  That's what is so strong in MILLION DOLLAR BABY, from Frankie's grungy boxing gym, to the boxing action, to the tenderness between Eastwood and Swank's characters.  It's all very compelling--it's all literally heartbreaking.  Obviously, my bias is showing; I'm giving this exceptionally good film four stars instead of five because it's simply too painful to watch the final half hour.  But it doesn't keep me from heartily recommending it.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

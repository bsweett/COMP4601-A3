<meta name="summary" content="Decent Film For The Family But...."></head><body><p>On paper having Shrek and his buddies exploring the Arthurian legends seemed to be something well worth exploring. Having it on the big screen, however, is another story entirely, and one which might resonate only with some younger kids in the family. Shrek (Michael Myers), Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Puss-N-Boots (Antonio Banderas) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are once more in fine form, with plenty of laughs in store, especially from Donkey as Shrek's comedic sidekick. But this isn't nearly as funny a film as the recent "Meet the Robinsons" nor one which will play strongly with your emotions. Instead, we're treated to stale "Valley Girl" jokes and barely amusing escapades (There's one classic scene of Shrek christening a ship which comes across as a third-rate imitation of a classic Mickey Mouse short film from the 1940s.). Justin Timberlake as the young King Arthur is mildly intriguing, but Eric Idle seems badly miscast as a bumbling Merlin. Still, I have no doubt that this film will please most in a young family, but jaded parents who think they've seen this before in classic live and animated screwball comedies, may find themselves wishing for a quick run to the theater exits.</p></body></html>

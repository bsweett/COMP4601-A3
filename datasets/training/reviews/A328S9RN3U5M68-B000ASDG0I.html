But now on DVD MR & MRS SMITH has a chance to prove it is a good little action film.  Pitt and Jolie do have a screen chemistry that is as strong as some of the old film classics.  The plot is a bit silly, but the script takes the chance of addressing some important issues about marriage, therapy, trust, fidelity, and the impact of making relationships work under duress.  Not a great movie but a well-paced one and full of enough fun moments to make it a nice evenings diversion. Grady Harp, November 05</p></body></html>

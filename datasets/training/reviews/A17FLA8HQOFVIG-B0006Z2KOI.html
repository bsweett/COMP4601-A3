<meta name="summary" content="Tries a little too hard and is a little too politically correct"></head><body><p>This 2004 film tells the story of the motorcycle trip Ernesto Guevara de la Sena and his friend Alberto Granado took in 1952 from Argentina to Peru.  Ernesto was a medical student and Alberto was a biochemist and they were privileged middle class Argentineans. Supposedly, that trip changed their politics forever, and Ernesto later became the revolutionary Che Guevara, the inspirational hero of a whole generation.  But this film is not about those later politics although this particularly trip was instrumental in raising the young mens' consciousness about the hardships and exploitation of South America's poor.<br /><br />The film is in Spanish with Gael Garcia Benal cast as the young Ernesto and Rodrigo De La Serna cast as Alberto.  Both are good in their roles although the screenplay itself lacks depth.  Mostly, it plays like a travelogue in which the two young men are always the observers.  And, in spite of a few short paragraphs which were so over-the-top with righteous indignation and political fervor that I actually found myself giggling, their adventures consisted mostly of having their motorcycle break down and meeting some native people. And then there were some overly-romanticized scenes in a leper colony.<br /><br />In real life, both of these young men wrote diaries and these diaries have been published and re-published many times.  I understand that sometimes their narratives conflicted.  And, as many of their adventures were described in a sketchy manner, it was the screenwriters who fleshed out this plot.  It might not have been such an interesting story though if Che Guevara didn't later become famous.  Mostly, it played like a coming-of-age story.<br /><br />Personally, I like to read about travels to places I know I'll never see.  That's why I had such hope for this film.  I had even read a book entitled "Chasing Che" by Patrick Symmes, who personally followed the trail taken by Guevara and Granado about fifty years later.  I loved that book and hoped to discover in this film that combination of adventure and discomfort that created a turning place in their lives.  Sadly, the film did not deliver this for me.<br /><br />I think The Motorcycle Diaries is a film that tried hard (actually a little too hard) to recapture the spirit of the open road and add a little political correctness at the same time.  But the adventures seemed disjointed and the injustices they witnessed were lightweight compared to other films which deal with the same issues.  That's why I can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.</p></body></html>

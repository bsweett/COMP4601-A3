<meta name="summary" content="Obvious but effective genre piece"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />No one is going to accuse Gran Torino of being subtle and the performances by the neophyte Hmong actors sometimes aren't great, but the film is undeniably effective, with much more humor than expected (to be honest I laughed more in this film than in most comedies) a pitch-perfect performance by Clint and an ending slightly but significantly different than I predicted; it's not the greatest film Clint's ever made but it's a solid piece of entertainment.<br /><br />3/4</p></body></html>

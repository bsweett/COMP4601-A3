<meta name="summary" content="Foster Mesmerizes"></head><body><p>The storyline in "The Brave One" is one that is very familiar in American cinema ... a brutalized victim reclaims their power by turning into a vigilante. Because this story is so familiar, and the script of "The Brave One" is just so-so, it took a great director (Neil Jordan, "The Crying Game") and a powerhouse lead actress to elevate the film into something more than just another revenge flick.<br /><br />Most of the credit goes to Foster. Her performance as Erica is absolutely mesmerizing. She portrays a woman who is equal parts frightened, repelled and astounded by the avenging vigilante she finds herself becoming. Her character maintains her complex emotional landscape even when she's delivering lines like "who's the bitch now?" (While killing one of the thugs who murdered her fianc&eacute; and nearly beat her to death.)<br /><br />Credit also belongs to Neil Jordan, who never allows the film to descend into cheesy fare, and occasionally allows it to explore the complex emotional reactions Americans have toward revenge and vigilante violence.<br /><br />This is a "Hollywood" film, to be sure, with an ending that's just a little too neat and tidy to fit the messy business of revenge. But it's one of the best "Hollywood" films I've seen lately.</p></body></html>

Shooter wants things rectified by Rainey and wants what is "right is right".From here it is a game of cat and mouse as Rainey promises to obtain proof that his story is genuine and his own so that the evil and enigmatic Shooter will go way and leave him alone.Easier said than done as a chain of complicated matters and violent events plunge and pull Depp's character into the madness created by Shooter. Seems that Shooter has made one stipulation that if Rainey does not follow through with or comply, his refusal will only make matters worse for him and those around him---especially for his wife whom he is going through the painful proceedings of a divorce process. Acts of animal cruelty, bizarre murders (body count starting to rise around central character)with everything pointing towards the menacing and mysterious Shooter...<p>I've never read the Stephen King story on which this film is based on so you won't get any "love it" or "hate it" comparisons from me between the book and film. There were quite a few obvious clues in the beginning of the film that pretty much gave away the "surprise" twist for me.There was a definite sense of predictability.Low and behold the movie's twist and ending is exactly the way I had envisioned it. I have seen this done so many times before in other previous movies using the same surprise premise. Was I disappointed? You bet.<p>The only reason for the 4 stars is the outstanding performances by Depp , Dutton and Turturro! Johnny's in familiar role acting territiory as the tortured central character who possesses that sharp sarcastic "right-back-at-ya-buddy" wit and hard edged cynicism that only Depp can do extremely well in his performances!He takes no crap.Period.A fine actor that never disappoints;you can literally see his creative wheel spinning in his head as he plays the role with great verve.<p>Charles S. Dutton's character was a bit underrated and could have used more film time as well as dialogue.Nevertheless, a great performance. Turturro as the mysterious and maniacal "Shooter" is an actor that can play such an evil role yet there is always something comedic in nature to his performance that adds that something to his sinister role.<p>For those who have seen the dvd with the alternate ending, THAT is the ending I would have used for true Stephen King style and atmosphere !<p>See Secret Window for a Saturday night at home flick and for the outstanding preformances by Depp, Tururro and Sutton but don't be shocked if you can figure out the twist from early on in the film !</p></body></html>

The film is not so much a horror film but a race against the clock.  Damien Thorn(Sam Neill) is trying to vanquish all opposition to his assuming his place as evil overlord of the Earth before the prophesied return of Christ.  A group of priests are out to eliminate Damien before he can enact his diabolical plan.  "The Final Conflict" has to viewed after seeing the preceding films because it assumes that you've seen them.  It works more as a stand alone than the preceding film, "Damien-Omen II".  Unlike the previous film, however, I would give it four stars even I hadn't seen the others.</p></body></html>

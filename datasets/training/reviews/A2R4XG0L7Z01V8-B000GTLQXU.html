<meta name="summary" content="This would have been amazing at the cinema but I'll make do with a 50 inch TV"></head><body><p>I must say, I have a fascination with anything water based in movies. Titanic, Hard Rain, and now Poseidon. I'm actually shocking myself to say that Poseidon is rivalling Titanic in my eyes. But Titanic is my main love.<br /><br />I'd already seen The Poseidon Adventure, and Beyond The Poseidon Adventure, before I got to see this on HD, so I knew what to expect. I thought I'd feel some loyalty towards the original, but I was blown away by this, and to watch it on a massive screen AND in HD as well, words cannot describe the experience. The sound is absolutely amazing, we had to keep turning the sound down, in order not to frighten the neighbours, and the picture is beyond perfect. Honestly I can't rave about HD much more. I actually went out the next afternoon to buy the regular DVD to compare, but I just had to do the review first. I loved the movie that much that I would have bought it anyway.<br /><br />I agree with some other reviewers that yes, the character development is not great, but I hope someday there will be a director's cut, as many of Fergie's scenes got cut. Fergie (or Stacy Ferguson if you prefer) was my one highlight of seeing this film - at the time I didn't realise Kurt Russell or Mia Maestro was in it - but I was disappointed to see she didn't have very much screen times. She's gorgeous, and has a gorgeous voice to match, but we didn't get to hear much of the latter either. I wish she could have shown off her acting skills by being one of the survivors. If only for a little while. My other very small problems with the movie were the loss of the Christmas tree, which played a pivotal role in the original. That should have stayed. The fact that not many of the passengers in the ballroom get a choice whether to go or not with the ragtag bunch of determined-to-escape passengers (Fergie, lift your feet and go!) I felt was also wrong. As they could have tried to escape. But then it did make for a spectacular scene, particularly when Fergie's character went over to the captain (I think?) and gave him a hug. That's when you know they know they have nothing left, but to surrender to whatever is about to happen.<br /><br />Also, some reviewers have complained about the fact that the scene with spotting the rogue wave on radar was cut. Why complain?! The director had to cut something to cut it down, it was probably unnecessary anyway, so it has to go. You have to be brutal. But this starts the sentimentality of the film - Richard Dreyfuss's character, alone at New Year, since his partner deserted him, is the first to spot the rogue wave, interrupting his impromptu suicide attempt. Believe me, if you're going to start crying at a film that was the point I nearly did! What a wuss.<br /><br />The rest of the cast were excellent though, my favourite was Mia Maestro, who I already knew from starring in Alias. She was the only person who stopped to help Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) & Chris (Mike Vogel), and her fear when they were trapped in that very small, and partly caved in air vent made me genuinely terrified myself. And let's face it, her cross necklace saved the day in the end!<br /><br />Most of the characters you will begin to warm to just when the ship capsizes in a few shocking minutes, when I swore I would never set foot on a ship again! There are the few stereotypical characters, mainly the Kurt Russell character, doing the overbearing and overprotective father routine on his daughter who's secretly engaged. The single mother & her son weren't given THAT much screen time - a lot of the others did get more - but the scene were she's on one side of a wall, and he's on the other, and it's slowly filling with water, will bring out the maternal side to anyone.<br /><br />Of course, with these films it's always a race against time, which is probably why I enjoy them so much. What's so original about this & funnily enough, the original is that the ship is capsized. Therefore, a million times the obstacles, and a REAL race against time, and the rising water. (Plus I can't swim that well, so it makes it even more shocking.) Yes, some of the characters do die along the way (and there's a similar death to Shelley Winter's death from the original), and I did shed a little tear, at one particular character death. I had to hide my face behind the cushion I just happened to be clutching throughout most of the film. Some of the death scenes, albeit not gory, were very realistic, and the expressions on the characters as they died have left an impression on me. Elevators come crashing down (look out if you happen to be UNDERNEATH it at the time), people fall great heights, and bodies get burnt to a crisp. Nice images huh?<br /><br />I absolutely adore this movie, and eagerly await a possible director's cut, or a better special edition, with deleted scenes. There appear to be no deleted scenes featured on the HD, although it's not much of a loss, when you see what is on it. You're quite spoilt. Complete with an in movie experience, which I'm not sure about, as I think, as I do with commentaries, it could be quite irritating.<br /><br />This movie is now a major high up feature on my favourites list, and I'm so happy to actually own it myself. Even if it's not on HD. But I'll make do. I'll try and sneak the HD into the DVD player again soon.</p></body></html>

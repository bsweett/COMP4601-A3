It is not a five star movie by any means but it is a good one all the same. Essentially the story, derived from the inventive book of the same name by Anthony Burgess, is set sometime in the future (looks very dated though and the book's slang dialogue can be a little off-putting), about a young leader of a gang of thugs who spends his free time raping, stealing, joyriding, fighting and eventually murdering. He is sent to prison where he volunteers for an experiment to help cure him of his ultra-violent tendencies. However, even though the experiment works (with a small musical side-effect), it is very little more than just a political gimmick to win votes. While on release he encounters everybody that he did wrong too but can not defend himself because he gets sick whenever he gets angry or is aroused.<p>The acting, score and camerawork are on top form but the film suffers from the confines of its restrictive storyline leaving very little room for character development, except for that of the protagonist. What it does not lack in is violence or plenty of moral proclamations about the world in general. It is more of a philosophical statement about the nature of a corrective society than anything else. Everyone seems just as guilty as the other and Kubrick has no qualms about turning the husband of a rape victim into a sinister materialist who exploits anything to his advantage.<p>There are no "good" people in this film and even our horror star of the show has his turn at the innocent victim in the end. The film is a strange play on society in general but does not really merit repetitive viewing. As a side note the film was banned in Great Britain for years. Kubrick pulled the film from distribution himself because he felt that England was not ready for his film. He would also not allow the former Soviet Union or the Eastern Block to watch it either. He certainly was a bit of an odd character and even though critics hold Kubrick as a master director he did make a lot of bunk films too. This is not one of them.</p></body></html>

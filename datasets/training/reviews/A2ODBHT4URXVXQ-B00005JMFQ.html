<meta name="summary" content="A few too many people"></head><body><p>This was a fun movie - flawed only by taking on the lives and loves of a few too many people. It's a romantic comedy in which there's a happy ending for about 12 of the 16 people involved as they careen into the stress and chaos of the Christmas holidays.<br />Another stretch is accepting Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister; I'm sorry, but he just doesn't look the part, nor does his endearing, hesitant, bumbling persona lend itself well to the role of a world leader. HOWEVER, there's a scene in which he thinks he's alone and he's dancing all over #10 Downing to recorded music, and he's really laying on some hotshot moves - - - and suddenly there's a staff member-secretary-middle-aged-woman-person type standing in the doorway with a sheaf of papers. It's terrific. I replayed it 3 times and laughed just as hard the 3rd time as I had the 1st.<br />Emma Thompson has a scene that's difficult to do justice to in words, and indeed, the scene is wordless. On Christmas morning, she realizes her husband (smarmy Alan Rickman) has a lover, and she leaves her family to go to her bedroom where she quietly, wordlessly, and eloquently regains control of her devastation. Masterful acting.<br />Good movie. Some wonderful acting. But man, that's a lot of people to keep track of.</p></body></html>

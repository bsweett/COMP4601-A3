Once there, it is his thoughts of his loved one and of home that provide him with the necessary strength to endure unprecedented difficulties.<br /><br />Cast Away is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is superb in his role as Chuck Noland, and although the rest of the cast do not have that many lines in the movie, nevertheless, they have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good!<br /><br />In short, Cast Away is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!</p></body></html>

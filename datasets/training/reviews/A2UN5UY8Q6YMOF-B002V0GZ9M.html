Time travel is always tricky in movies and if this was sci-fi, I would have picked it apart.  But time travel and romance fit together nicely.  This reminded me of another of my favorite movies "Somewhere in Time" staring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour.  Keanu and Sandra worked well together-felt like a Speed reunion.  Picture quality was very good, especially for a small combo disc. Overall quite enjoyable and worth at least a rent.</p></body></html>

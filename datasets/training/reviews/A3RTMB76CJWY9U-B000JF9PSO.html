<meta name="summary" content="United 93--The Tragic Flight as it Really Might Have Happened"></head><body><p>United 93 depicts the horrific events during September 11, 2001, leading up to the crash of flight United 93, which terrorists had planned to use to demolish the U.S. Capitol building as they had the World Trade Center.<br /><br />There are probably many who feel that this film is "too soon" or in other ways in bad taste (i.e. trying to capitalize on a tragedy). However, if we agree that a film should be made on this subject at all, this film did it correctly. There is nothing overtly "cinematic" about this movie--we're just shown what happened. It is not moralizing at us. It is not telling us how to feel about anything. Just showing what happened, kind of like a dramatic re-enactment.<br /><br />If there is a message to the movie, it is only because the real life events themselves contained it. Perhaps the most compelling "theme" is how unprepared the government was to deal with this kind of a crisis--how the only people in a position to do anything at all were the passengers on the plane. One moment of dark comedy is how, with all of their technology and power, neither the military nor the FAA could figure out what the hijackers were doing until they turned on CNN and watched the coverage along with everyone else.<br /><br />I imagine that some people will complain that the terrorists were not depicted as being more villainous. It is true that some of the hijackers are treated with some measure of sympathy--they are shown to be human beings. However, this is not inappropriate, as whatever else they were, the hijackers *were* human beings. We don't know, and can't know, whether any of the terrorists hesitated, as was portrayed in this movie, but it doesn't make their deeds any less heinous for it. It simply makes them more believable and realistic, which is important because that's the great strength of this movie.<br /><br />United 93 is not really an enjoyable movie to watch simply because it is so sad, but it is well made and very powerful. It draws its power via the fact that it presents these still-painful events  impartially and with an open eye--that it does so realistically--and the quality of the film answers any objections I had going in as to the appropriateness of its creation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Uncalled for and Crude but....Hilarious"></head><body><p>The creators of South Park  do it again and make one of the crudest and funniest movies you'll see. Not sure how Roger Ebert or anyone could just dismiss it with one star. It makes fun of politics and celebrities and pretty much everything else. They even turn Matt Damon into a moron that can just say....Matt Damon. I'm a Matt Damon fan but when he did that it always got me to laugh out loud. Plus they turn Alec Baldwin into the world's greatest actor that no one can out act.<br /><br />  I never thought a movie with puppets could be so damn funny. Even the song (Pearl Harbor Sucked but I love you) was pretty funny. Well the song went something like that. The song knocks Ben Afflick's acting skills. Even the Team America theme song is uncalled for. "America "F" YEAH!" It also offers a crude and disgusting but also hilarious sex scene. Plus there's one of the grossest longest puke scenes in the history of film. It goes on so long that it even made me start to feel sick. Still I was laughing while feeling sick.</p></body></html>

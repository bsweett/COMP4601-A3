<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly good"></head><body><p>Having avoided it in theatres because of Brett Ratner's involvement (you have to admit, after the lifeless Rush Hour 2 and Red Dragon, what were the odds on Ratner being able to do anything right?), usually the guarantee of lazy paint-by-numbers filmmaking at best, to my very great surprise the much-troubled X-Men: The Last Stand turned out to actually be good - very good - with Ratner for once putting a little effort into proceedings in a film that's far more successful than Bryan Singer's take on Supes and has all the excitement and emotional power that film lacked.<br /><br />It helps that Singer established the emotional background strongly enough in the first two films for Ratner to be able to just get on with telling a story (I do wonder how well it would work for a newcomer to the franchise with no prior investment in the characters), and there's still a part of me that figures that Singer and Matthew Vaughn spent so long in pre-production before leaving the film that the action sequences were probably fairly comprehensively storyboarded before Ratner came aboard because there's none of his customary just-point-the-camera-in-the-general-direction laziness, but I still have to give Mr I-don't-like-action-it-bores-the-audience credit where credit is due for not screwing it up - the big set-pieces are genuinely impressive, and this is a cracking yarn that rarely lets up. He even gets something like a performance out of Halle Berry, which is more than Singer ever managed. Shame about the terrible CGI make-up effects that make the `younger' Patrick Stewart look like a Final Fantasy character in the prologue though.<br /><br />Although some found the film a little too short, after looking at the deleted scenes on the DVD, I'm not really sure if it is that possible to extend the movie without going the Spiderman 2.1 route and filming new scenes - most of them are alternate bet-hedging versions of scenes in the film (like the Rogue cured/not cured variations). But it's pretty rare to see a blockbuster people would actually like to be longer these days!</p></body></html>

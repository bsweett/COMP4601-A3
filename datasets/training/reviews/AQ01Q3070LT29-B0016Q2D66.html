<meta name="summary" content="Kate Winslet & Leonardo DiCaprio work together again."></head><body><p>Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were a success as lead actor and actress in the Acamedy Award epic movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VS6R26">Titanic (10th Anniversary Edition)</a>. A tying record 11 Academy Awards.<br />  Now Leonardo and Kate re-team in a new movie, Revolutionary Road, directed by Sam Mendes (then married to Kate Winslet, divorced in 2010).<br />  April (Kate Winslet) and Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) meet at a party in the 1950's. They dance and become involved. She wants to be an actress.<br />  Now 7 years later, we see that conversation between the two married couple gets quite heated. She doesn't wish to discuss her bad night in the play. He keeps harping on her about it.<br />  The next morning, while Frank goes to work at the firm, April begins to recall how their marriage has been.<br />  She remembers when Helen (Kathy Bates) first showed them the quaint Connecticut house on Revolutionary Hill.<br />  This is Frank's 30th birthday, he is bored with his job and his family life. He has an affair with a co-worker, Zoe (Maureen Grube).<br />  At home, his wife decides to become a more understanding wife and surprises him with a birthday cake and their two children at her side.  She has another idea to present to him.<br /><br />  My thoughts: I enjoyed seeing Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet working together again and hope they will consider doing another movie together in the near future. I just did not care for this type of story. Not a winner.<br />  I like Winslet with the blond hair.<br /><br />  May I suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I2JDEY">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> (1966).<br /><br />  I enjoyed Kathy Bates in this film, who was also in, Titanic (1997).<br /><br />Didn't recognize David Harbour right away as "Shep Campbell". He was in the sequel to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MNP2KI">Casino Royale (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a> (2006), at that time with a mustache in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PPLIEG">Quantum of Solace</a> (2008).<br /><br />  Kathryn Hahn was pleasent to watch in her role as "Milly Campbell".<br /><br />Option of audio and subtitles in English, French, Spanish.<br /><br />  Special Features: Audio commentary by director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Justin Haythe, Making of..., 5 deleted scenes.</p></body></html>

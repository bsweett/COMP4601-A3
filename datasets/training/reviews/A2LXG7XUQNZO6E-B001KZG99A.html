Almost. While Iron Man may be an amazing film, it's worlds apart tonally from DC's The Dark Knight, an equally amazing film. Iron Man is flashy, witty and adventurous, whereas The Dark Knight is darker, grittier, and far more mature. Superhero fantasy film fans are really going to be split down the middle on this; I've come across quite a few people that claim Iron Man is the best comic book flick ever made while others insist The Dark Knight was an instant cinematic masterpiece with more substance. That's going to be up to all of you.<br /><br />Concerning acting, brilliant stuff, every single actor came strong and delivered their dialogue superbly! I think the only performance I wasn't thrilled with was Terrence Howard's; he just didn't pop for me, I'm almost glad to see him leave the sequel. He's a capable actor but I'm confident Don Cheadle will give Rhodes a new dimension and, hopefully, his alter-ego War Machine as well. Speaking of War Machine, the suit cameo looked awesome; you just know it's going to be pimped to the hilt in the next installment.<br /><br />This movie's CG was mesmerizing and production design was breathtaking, this is everything a good comic book fantasy film should be. It ups the ante on every single front, especially the phenomenal dialogue. Favreau is without a doubt a capable director and this film in his hands was masterful. I've watched it twice and I'm still getting chills watching it. Bravo!</p></body></html>

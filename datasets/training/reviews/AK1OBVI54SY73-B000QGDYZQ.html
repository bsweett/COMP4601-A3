<meta name="summary" content="Suprise of the Year"></head><body><p>There is always one film each year at least to me that looks like it will be a success as a film and then when you watch it...well it ends up being a failure instead and you're left surprised and disappointed. Premonition for me is just that film.<br /><br />Bullock and the rest of the cast do the best they can with what they're given; the cast was not the problem. The scenes and music also were done rather well for a thriller. The atmosphere of the film is indeed perfect. But it's the story itself that makes you lose interest eventually. Like others have said here- the bouncing back and forth of days Bullock's character goes through gets confusing and overall tiring. The pieces do come together but by the time it all does start making sense you've already made your decision about how you feel about this film and most will say it was boring, messy and the ending was oh so predictable.<br /><br />I was counting on Premonition to be a pretty good thriller, and although they set up the movie well to be one, it falls flat unfortunately. I recommend saving your money and just waiting for it to come on cable.<br /><br />2.5/5</p></body></html>

No big names in this one, just the return of Jigsaw and his apprentice, Amanda. Some of the graphic and brutal tortue scenes are kind of silly but I always liked to story behind as to why these individulas don't appreciate their lives (Jigsaw has an obsession of people who don't feel grateful). This sequel doesn't compare to the original or even Saw II, but if you want to know how this baby ends then indulge yourself in a little game of cat and mouse. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant, creepy, and then not"></head><body><p>"28 Days Later..." gets off to a brilliant start.  A commando team of European animal rights activists breaks into a secret lab in the UK and liberates a single chimpanzee, strapped to a bed and forced to watch continuous TV feeds of rioting and other atrocities.  The chimp's rage becomes contagious.  He attacks one of the commandos, and in a fountain of blood, the end of the world is on.<br /><br />The action picks up 28 days later, when Jim (Cillian Murphy, who has since broken through as an actor) awakens from a coma in a deserted hospital.  In a digital video homage to "The Day of the Triffids", Jim wanders the hospital (and later, a deserted London) for several minutes before he finally meets some victims of the rage epidemic... infected, highly contagious victims.  Soon, he is rescued by two uninfected survivors, and they band together first in search of safety, and then in search of a cure.<br /><br />The first hour of "28 Days Later...", penned by Alex Garland, whose novel "The Beach" (a study of European backpackers in an uneasy paradise) was let down by a woeful film adaptation, underlines Garland's strengths as a novelist.  The first several characters we meet, beginning with Jim, are all well-defined and are known only by their first names -- something that you'd expect in a world where last names, like cash and cell phones, no longer matter.  Even those characters who die after just a few minutes are well-written.  The most compelling of the bunch is Brendan Gleeson, who brutally slaughters a group of infected before revealing that he's just a kindly cab driver who dotes on his 14 year-old daughter.<br /><br />The use of digital cameras lends a herky-jerky movement to the infected, and also allows director Boyle to expand on the scenes of devastation (such as a wide shot of a burning Manchester).  However, Boyle's best directorial flourish is entirely natural: after 28 days with no running water, a fishtank is down to a few inches of water, and the surviving goldfish are mournfully confined to the very bottom of the tank.  The acting performances for the first hour of the movie are all determined, yet decidedly not over the top.<br /><br />In the second half of the movie, a major cast member dies in very tragic fashion, and then the military takes over.  Led by Christopher Eccleston, playing a British army colonel a million miles from his recent portrayal of "Doctor Who", a group of nine very creepy soldiers establishes a temporary refuge from the virus.  After an unsettling dinner party, Eccleston reveals his motives to Jim, some of the soldiers turn hostile, and the movie quickly devolves into a tiring base under siege picture.  The action here is well directed, but the content is not quite as interesting as the first hour.<br /><br />The DVD content is superb.  Boyle and Garland (but mostly Boyle) lend a commentary track not only to the movie, but also to six deleted scenes (in various stages of completion), three alternate endings, and two photo stills galleries.  The alternate endings show that Boyle & Garland struggled to end the picture, but that the ending they settled on (shot several months after the close of filming, on different film stock, thanks to an infusion of cash from a new distributor) is clearly the best.  One discarded ending, which omits the Eccleston storyline in favor of a more scientific solution to the virus problem, exists only in animated storyboards, and is well presented with Boyle & Garland reading from the script treatment.<br /><br />"28 Days Later..." presents a common apocalyptic scenario with compelling vision.  With strong direction, a talented cast, and a terrific DVD presentation, this movie is a strong entrant in a crowded genre.</p></body></html>

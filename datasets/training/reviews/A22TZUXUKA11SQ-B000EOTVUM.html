<meta name="summary" content="Hello, my name is Terrified"></head><body><p>In the spirit of Halloween, I thought I'd rent this movie to get me into the mood for the season.  I thought it would be scary, but not terrifying. I was wrong. Let me preface this review by saying I like scary movies, but I get frightened whether it's Scream, The Amityville Horror, or Friday the 13th. It's the music that does it more than the murder. That being said, you don't even need the scary music when you have the sounds of people being tortured, of a woman begging for her life, and of a person so traumatized that even when you're scolding her for breathing so loudly while the killer searches for her you know you'd do the same thing in her place. Any movie where people are just minding their own business trying to do their hiking/camping thing and something goes wrong and they, foolishly, believe in the inherent goodness of others only to wind up being hunted has the potential for being either creepy or campy. Wolf Creek is the former.  After watching this movie I had to watch some episodes of Family Guy just to get to sleep. I'd highly recommend it if you're in the mood for a scary movie.... just as long as you have something lighthearted to watch afterward.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An "in the future movie" that actually works"></head><body><p>The movie starts out revolving around a drug-addict Tom Cruise is the lead cop on a special type of crime force.  What this squad does is watch crimes happen before they are commited, there are 3 "special" children that can tell the futute.  How the police got their hands on em is a whole nother story.  So there is a new advisor of some sort played by Colin Ferrel, right when he enters the story, Cruise is watching a crime happen so that he can go stop it, but he sees himself committing the crime.  The movie flips the switch here and this is your warning to put your seatbelt on.<br /><br />A great movie by Spielberg where he is at his best.</p></body></html>

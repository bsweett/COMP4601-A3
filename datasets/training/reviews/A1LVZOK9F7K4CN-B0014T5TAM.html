<meta name="summary" content="Good...but not great..."></head><body><p>This is a good interpretation of Ian McEwan's novel.  I liked it...but I didn't love it.  It's usually a bad sign when you think: "It took me less time to read the book than it does to watch the movie.  There are many good things about the movie - especially the acting.  Kiera Knightly is fine and James McAvoy is fast becoming one of my favorite new actors.<br /><br />And yet...<br /><br />Part of the problem is with Briony.  The actress who plays her as a young girl is fine, but for some reason the filmmakers felt the need to give her some apparent sexual hang-ups in order to give an (unsatisfactory) motivation.  The actress who plays Briony as a young woman comes across as a cipher.<br /><br />As I intimated, there was also a problem with the pacing.  Events are dealt with in a more heavy-handed way in the book than in the movie.  The book was about the problems of perception, but the movie seems to sidestep this - implying that Briony knew the truth all along.</p></body></html>

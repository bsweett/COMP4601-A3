<meta name="summary" content="It's surprising that it doesn't suck that stands out"></head><body><p>Let's face it, when Joel Schumacher makes a movie, he can either be pretty dead-on or just way off the page he's not even in the same book (read: Batman and Robin). Taking an incredibly flimsy premise and paper-thin plot and stretching it out to movie length should've been a call for disaster but the fact is that the movie ended up being so gripping makes one think it's anything other than a fluke. Is it Schumacher's direction? Colin Farrell's performance? Or is it that the premise is so original and even neat that it's hard not to be enthralled by it?<br /><br />Stu works in promoting clients in the Big Apple and often goes through rather misleading ways to get what he wants: promises a big bash for a restaurant he owes money to as payment, playing magazines against each other for bigger demand in his client and whatnot. He also has something he wants going on as well: a beautiful client, Pam, who he wants to be more than friends with. Instead of using his cell where his wife, Kelly, can check the calls, he uses a pay phone. Only after, he gets a call: a man(voiced by Keifer Sutherland of 24) is watching him and worse: he's got a sniper rifle. Stu has to figure out how to please the sniper and not get shot while also trying to do nothing that'll get policemen to fire at him.<br /><br />That's basically the entire plot: man in a phone booth talking to a sniper and on occasion people in the crowd such as Radha Mitchell of Silent Hill (Kelly) Katie Holmes (Pam) or the police captain played by Forest Whitaker. Why Keifer's character would spend his time on someone who hasn't committed adultery yet is strange but at least Colin acts his *** off and makes him completely likable by the end of the film. Known for a sort of intense whispering he does on 24, Sutherland basically unleashes his malevolence on Stu and it's so fun. Why they bothered though with Katie Holmes is beyond me since she barely has any significant lines and after awhile she just stares at stuff.<br /><br />Now of course the film has holes such as little plot holes or annoyances (a group of hookers needs a phone so they bother with the one Stu's stuck in...as the opening says, there's so many cell phone users or public phones and they just have to bug Stu about his?) But oddly enough the film is actually kind of short. I think my time code said something like an hour and 15 or 17 when the film ended and while there's not much to do with the premise, you get so caught up that you're like "whoa whoa, that's all?"<br /><br />Back in the old days of DVD, many were on what was called a "flipper" meaning one half of the movie on one side, other half on the other. Now, it's been used mainly to separate the fullscreen version and widescreen such as now. While I have no issue with this, the special features are unbelievably small. We get a pretty good commentary by Schumacher that talks about the film but that's it, no making-of's or interviews, not even those back scratching "I love working with that guy, he's so great" EPK's you see on HBO. I'm sure they'll be a double-dip in the future but since it's not a massively liked film I'm sure it'll be awhile.<br /><br />Is it worth your time? Surprisingly yes. It made not be the best film you'll see, but it'll probably be the funnest you've seen in awhile.</p></body></html>

Unfortunately, studios don't view superhero movies that way and see a particular character or characters as being a franchise:  if they can get characters on the screen more than in just three movies then the better it is for them.  This seems to be the approach that was taken with X-MEN: THE LAST STAND.  The series was originally envisioned as being a trilogy with one or two spin-offs.  That approach seems to have been thrown out.  Granted some of that might have to do with the series and film's original director, Bryan Singer, leaving and taking the majority of the production crew with him to make SUPERMAN RETURNS.  After Singer's departure, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND was in production limbo for awhile until Brett Ratner was given the reigns.  In a strange bit of irony, Ratner was originally supposed to direct the first two X-Men films and left and was supposed to direct SUPERMAN RETURNS and left there, too. In both instances, Singer took over the helm.  Despite the change-up in direction and production, there really isn't an excuse for X-MEN: THE LAST STAND being the somewhat lackluster film that it came to be.<br /><br />The story itself is full of promise.  The federal government develops a vaccine that can cure mutants of their disease.  Many mutants are excited by the prospect of living life as a normal human.  However, many other mutants aren't very keen on the idea.  Neither Professor X (Patrick Stewart) or Magneto (Ian McKellen) support the vaccine.  Both mutant leaders believe that mutants should embrace their talents and gifts. However, the two leaders strongly differ on their approach.  Professor X preaches tolerance while Magneto sees the creation of the vaccine as a declaration of war upon all mutants.  The mutants led by Magneto begin the war against humanity in full force, while the X-Men find themselves in the middle: protecting the humans and preaching Professor X's message of tolerance and unity.<br /><br />The movie builds up to a huge climatic battle between Magneto's mutants and the X-Men and humans on Alcratraz.  Unfortunately, this battle doesn't live up to the expectations it has built.  There are some very cool parts of the battle, e.g. the scenes with Beast (Kelsey Grammer).  However, the battle is rather anti-climatic.  Everything in the film leads up to that battle and then nothing really happens.  That is a major let down.<br /><br />The best part about X-MEN: THE LAST STAND is seeing different mutants on screen.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is back as is Storm (Halle Berry).  Professor X and Magneto are here, too.  In fact many of the mutants from the first two movies have returned (well Toad and Sabertooth and Nightcrawler are mysteriously absent, though Nightcrawler's absence is explained in the video game based on the movie). However, other than those four most of the mutants play much smaller roles.  Rogue is hardly on the screen; Cyclops is destroyed with only about a minute of screen time; Angel's introduction is huge, but he's not really seen.  I realize that part of this is because there are so many superheroes and not all of them can be seen in each film.  However, part of it is because the studio is setting things up for sequels to come.  In some way, they are following the lead of the comic books:  some characters are written off to make room for new ones, but if need be you can always bring someone back from the dead.  That makes for interesting, though frustrating reading, but doesn't translate well on the big screen.<br /><br />Overall, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND is a mediocre comic book movie.  The movie introduces some great new characters and contains some very interesting battle sequences.  However, the film fails to live up to the climatic expectations that it promises.</p></body></html>

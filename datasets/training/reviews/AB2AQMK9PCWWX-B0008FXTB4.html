<meta name="summary" content="Life, As Well as Cinema, Is a Remix....."></head><body><p>...Chilli Palmer, the Get Shorty conman/movie producer, decides to go into the record producing business when a record label owner is shot in broad daylight by a toupee wearing Russian mob hit man. Events unfold synchronicitously (is that a word?) around him and Chilli gets things working in his direction like some kinda ultro hip Zen Shaman. Or mebbe he has the instinct to be a record remix producer, who knows. Actually, Travolta is playing straight man to these assorted zanies--Vince Vaughn as a wanna be hip-hop manager, The Rock as a gay/wanna be in movies (Send Me Your Head Shot), Cedrick the Entertainer as the Ivy League educated Shug Knight styled rap artist mogol, said Russian mobsters, and Keitel playing a smarmy type he's known to do well. Do not expect any standout performances here, all are equally effective. Whatch out for Ced's Mr. Demille Close-Up performance. Eye candies Uma Thurman (most recall her performances in the kicka** Kill Bill) and Millian give the guys a visual feast. Anyhow, it's a good movie to have fun with on one of those lazy Sat. afternoons.</p></body></html>

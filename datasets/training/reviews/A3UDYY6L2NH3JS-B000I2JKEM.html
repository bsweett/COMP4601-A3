Just enjoy the animation  that is superbly creative and the situation that is so full of humor, black and white and in colors, that you may end up losing your marbles and loosening your jaws. The music is definitely marvelous and mysterious. A Danse Macabre in high noble society and a wedding march in the cemetery. An accidental marriage crossing the life and death divide that has to be repaired to satisfy the true right love marriage that could not take place due to some infernal elopement or kidnaping of the bridegroom. The characters are superb marionnettes and cartoons so nimble and yet stiff at the same time that they seem to be dancing cripples in wheelchairs. It's true though the dog is the best of them all. This film is a caricature, a satire of any commonplace trite established statement and of any attempt at being creative and escaping this preprogramed and overdigested world of ours. You will think of many other films and you will be right, though you will miss most of them. At times it is a direct allusion like an echo and at times it is an indirect allusion like a photographic negative. And the best of it all is that it is neither gross nor frightening, but deeply romantic, with maybe a touch of slavonic nostalgia and sadness.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></body></html>

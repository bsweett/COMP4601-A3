<meta name="summary" content="Details of limited 2-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition due out August 26th, 2008"></head><body><p>Aaron has already pointed out the main announced difference between this Ultimate edition and the non-ultimate Collector's Edition, the numbered, hand-painted bust of Jack Skellington with his Sandy Claws hat and beard and a sound chip that plays quotes from the movie (with certificate of authenticity).  Amazon has since posted more details (above).  Looks like the bust will come in a special coffin-shaped box.  This edition will also have a booklet with the Nightmare Before Christmas poem, and an additional DVD for the digital copy.  Not sure what the advantage of the extra disc is.  It will cost you about an extra hundred bucks for those extras.  For that money, you may as well know about the movie and the other details of the set and the alternative new releases.<br /><br />The Nightmare Before Christmas is the kind of Christmas movie you might expect from Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands): macabre, sort-of-but-not-too-scary, and ultimately good-humored and good-natured.  It's also quite a feat of animation, the first feature-length stop-action film.  And it's a musical!<br /><br />The story takes place in a world where the magical side of each major holiday is run by a specialized, hidden holiday town, like Santa's North Pole headquarters.  One year, the restless Jack Skellington of Halloween Town discovers Christmas Town, is very impressed, and decides Halloween Town should expand its horizons and take over Christmas that year.  Unfortunately, he and the other residents of his town don't understand Christmas as well as they do Halloween, and their basically well-intentioned efforts threaten to ruin Christmas altogether.<br /><br />The animation is highly imaginative and particularly well suited to the Halloween connections, as we would expect from a Burton-produced project.  The songs, by Danny Elfman, are catchy and fun, partly because of twisted but good-hearted subject matter.  There are scares, adventures, a romance, lessons learned, and a good Christmassy outcome.  Most kids and adults will be delighted, though parents may wish to consider the scary stuff for very young kids who don't like being scared.<br /><br />The Nightmare Before Christmas is returning to DVD in three editions, all with newly restored and remastered transfers.  For standard definition, there will be the 2-disc Collector's Edition (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUOU">here</a>) and this Ultimate Collector's Edition, which will have the same features except for those mentioned above.  This will be the first time the movie will be available in anamorphic widescreen.  There will also be new special features.<br /><br />There will be a Blu-ray edition with the same DVD special features plus an exclusive intro by Burton (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUP4">here</a>).  There has been no announcement for a Blu-ray Ultimate edition with the bust, and I don't see a page for one here at Amazon.<br /><br />The new special features, shared by all the new new editions, are these:<br /><br />-- audio commentary with producer/writer Tim Burton, director Henry Selick and composer Danny Elfman (who also sings in the movie)<br />-- Burton's original "The Nightmare Before Christmas" poem read by legendary horror actor Christopher Lee<br />-- new intro by Burton for Frankenweenie (see below)<br />-- a digital copy of the movie<br />-- "What's This? Jack's Haunted Mansion Holiday Tour," a two-part promo for the Disneyland theme park attraction<br /><br />Features carried over from the 2000 Special Edition, shared by all the new editions:<br /><br />-- "The Making of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas" (about 25 minutes on the Special Edition)<br />-- "The Worlds of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas" (the worlds being Halloween Town, Christmas Town, and "The Real World")<br />-- deleted scenes (scenes that didn't get past the storyboards and cut animated scenes)<br />-- storyboard to film comparison<br />-- theatrical trailers and posters<br />-- Burton's early short stop-action film Vincent, about a boy who dreams of being Vincent Price, who narrates (5:50)<br />-- uncut version of Frankenweenie, Burton's early short live-action film wherein the basic events of Frankenstein are played out in suburban America, with a young boy in the place of Dr. Frankenstein and a pet dog in the place of the monster (29:50)<br /><br />There's no mention in the press release of the old commentary with Selick and director of photography Pete Kozachik, which went into detail about the technical aspects of the animation.  No mention either of the DTS 5.1 sound option included on the Special Edition.  The sound will be Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, aspect ratio 1.66:1 (original format).<br /><br />Looks like an excellent set.  The video and sound quality of the previous DVD was excellent, and Disney claims the new anamorphic version will be even better.</p></body></html>

He is a natural and really embodies the character just right. There is wit and charm and appeal. However, I found the movie a tad on the slow side and fairly predictable. There was no doubt in my mind who the 'bad guy' was, and I know nothing about this comic book.<br /><br />This film, though fun at times did not spark my interest like The Dark Knight or even Transformers did. There were boring lulls and nothing particularly interesting to fill the action-less void. Iron Man is certainly a very good comic book movie, far better than many I've seen, but certainly not the best. It will appeal to many, mostly, again, because of the main character's likeability and the very nice special effects the film has to offer.</p></body></html>

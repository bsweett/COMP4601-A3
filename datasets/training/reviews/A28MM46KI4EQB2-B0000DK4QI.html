<meta name="summary" content="Classic!"></head><body><p>This is one of my all time favorite movies, and whenever a new viewing format comes out, this is one of those titles that I will usually upgrade sometime after they put it out on the new format.  I have been watching this movie since I was in high school, and it's absolutely one of my all time favorites. I was actually fairly impressed with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040YFR1Y">Predators ( + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray</a>] as well, which I would have to say would be my 2nd favorite Predator movie next to this one.  I wasn't as big a fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VFM0YW">Predator 2 [Blu-ray</a>] or necessarily the Alien vs Predator movies, but they were decent I suppose.  Anyway, this will always be one of my absolute favorites, along with the likes of such movies as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RE29T0">Alien [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RE29PO">Aliens [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RIY4WE">Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Skynet Edition) [Blu-ray</a>], and various others.  This is not any kind of spectacular collectors edition Blu-Ray or anything, but it's still cool.</p></body></html>

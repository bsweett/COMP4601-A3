I have loved every one of his films-"Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Human Nature, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" and now this. Out of all his films, I thought this one was the best. This was moving, funny, dramatic, and wildly inventive, all at the same time. It stars Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and they both could be contenders at the Oscars next year, seriously. The film is a work of genius, and it's constantly entertaining, and all of the scenes work. It is not  your average Jim Carrey movie like "Bruce Almighty," and "Liar, Liar." Carrey proves once again that he could do more then physical comedy, and he already proved himself with "The Majestic" which I really liked. <p>The movie is about Joel Barish. One day he decides to skip work and take a train out to the beach. On the return trip he meets Clementine Kruczynski. They both become attracted to each other and become a couple. They are exactly the opposite of each other, and this is proved when Clementine leaves and doesn't seem to know who Joel is. Joel finds out from his friends that Clementine has had him erased from her memory, and doesn't remember ever having a relationship with him. Joel finds out that she went to Lacuna, founded by Dr Howard Mierzwiak, and he decides to go check things out. Thinking that it is a hoax, he decides to have the procedure done to him, sort of as a revenge as well. Joel meets Stan who is doing the prodedure, Patrick who works at Lacuna, and is also dating Clementine, and Mary who is the receptionist at the office, who also has a crush on Howard. Most of the movie takes place in Joel's mind, and his memories are deleted backwards. Joel goes through the most painful memories of his relationship first, and then the ones where him and Clementine had good times. He decides that he wants the procedure to stop, but the erasure team cannot hear him, so Joel and his memory of Clementine are forced to flee around Joel's mind and hide.<p>Jim Carrey is giving his best preformance yet as Joel, and I also thought that Tom Wilkinson was great as the founder of Lacuna, but he always does great anyway. "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is a movie that I feel could be up for many Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Score, and Best Orignal Screenplay, just to name a few. This is one of the best films of the year, and also probally the most inventive. I give it five stars, and I plan on getting it when it comes out on DVD. I am also awaiting Kaufman's next movie.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for language, some drug and sexual content.</p></body></html>

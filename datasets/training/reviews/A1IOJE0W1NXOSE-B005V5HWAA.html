By night he is a serial killer who is "addicted" to killing.  He is spurred on in his killing by a voice inside of him who is personified by William Hurt.  In the past Kevin Costner has been over-rated in some of his movie roles, but this time he shows some real acting skill and succeeds in creating the "flat affect" that is so often part of a psychopathic personality.  As has been pointed out, the plot is full of holes big enough to drive a tank through, but certainly the movie keeps your attention and has some very intriguing moments.</p></body></html>

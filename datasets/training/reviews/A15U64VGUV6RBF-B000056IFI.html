His merciless cyborg stalks and glowers his way to near perfection throughout this movie. I can't think of another truly evil character this iconic that has held our attention and filled us with dread for that long. Even Vader has some redemption in the end. The Terminator just, well...terminates people. And we love him for it. Do what I did and treat yourself to a great piece of 1980's film noir. The Blu-ray version's clarity and soundtrack is well worth every penny.</p></body></html>

THe ending, I admit, is somewhat feel-good, but the death of some of the principal characters - one at her own request - make this something special, in the realm of truly excellent hard science fiction.  As such, while bringing out notions about American society with a theme of race and inclusiveness underneath, there is trajedy in these deaths.  Once again, the acting is simply spectacular, and the characters continue to evolve.  That makes this series outstanding, with a beginning and a potential end.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm, even for fans of the comic.  I recognize many of the episodes of this from comics that are 25 years old, but changed into its own art.  You can view all three as a whole, and they completely entertained me on several successive nights.  With Spiderman, these are the best comic book films ever made, not campy and grotesquely silly, but extending the medium to express some genuinely important thoughts about the human condition.  But then, that is Marvel as its best, right down to the hilarious cameos of Stan Lee in each film.</p></body></html>

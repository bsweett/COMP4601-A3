<meta name="summary" content="An Epic Sci-Fi Film!!!"></head><body><p>I have owned this movie for years, but tonight I finally watched it all the way through after seeing the new Star Trek film! (That's another review for another time) I loved the great special effects and imagery. I still haven't seen the original series yet, but I may someday. After three Klingon ships are destroyed by an alien force, Starfleet asks the U.S.S. Enterprise to investigate it. They encounter an alien probe that takes Ilia and replaced by a robotic probe named V'ger. If you are a Trekkie, you'll love STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE!!!</p></body></html>

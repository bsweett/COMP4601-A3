<meta name="summary" content="Wow"></head><body><p>The really interesting story of female serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  Well directed story that makes you feel sorry and despise Aileen.  Charlize Theron give the performance of her life.  Putting on a bunch of weight, false teeth, greasy hair and no makeup, you might not even recognize her.  Beside the physical portion, she really becomes Aileen.  I can't say enough good things about her.  If not for anything else, you must watch this film for her performance.</p></body></html>

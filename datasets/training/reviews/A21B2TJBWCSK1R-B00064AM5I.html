This raises an important (well, not really) question-can it even be called a sport? On the surface, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story seems to say yes but in actuality it is an accurate parody of this silly activity that one used to play as a child in gym class. Now, it is televised and played by "professionals." It's time to take this ridiculous enterprise down a notch.<br /><br />The attention to details is a part of what makes this such a funny movie. There is the skewering of the many ESPN TV channels as the tournament is shown on ESPN 8 (their slogan is "If it's almost a sport we've got it here."). The two sports commentators are played with gusto by Gary Cole and Jason Bateman who gleefully spout many funny, off-the-cuff comments that make fun of these kinds of broadcasters.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber and actors Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. Thurber mentions that he wrote the roles specifically for Stiller, Vaughn and Justin Long. Stiller and Vaughn comment on scenes with dry, sardonic humour while Thurber plays the straight man.<br /><br />There are seven deleted scenes with optional commentary from Thurber. He mentions that they were cut for time and pacing. There is some good footage here, including more with Justin (Long) and his dream of being a cheerleader.<br /><br />Also included is a more downbeat alternate ending with optional commentary from Thurber. He mentions that test audiences didn't like it and the studio forced him to re-shoot it, even leaving the production for ten days in protest. This is a rare insight into a problem that he ran into in an otherwise congratulatory collection of extras.<br /><br />"Dodgeball Boot Camp: Training for Dodgeball" features footage of the cast training for the dodgeball sequences. Interestingly, they all had to learn how to dodge and throw the ball like professional dodgeballers.<br /><br />"The Anatomy of a Hit" examines why physical humour is so funny. Thurber explains that the tendency for an actor is to flinch before you're hit by an object.<br /><br />"Justin Long: A Study in Ham and Cheese" features a scene with the actor adlibbing as he mentally prepares himself for dodgeball followed by a montage of many ball hits that he endured for a scene.<br /><br />"Dodgeball: Go for the Gold" has Stiller and Vaughn making a mock-plea for dodgeball to be considered as an Olympic sport.<br /><br />There is the obligatory blooper/gag reel that features the usual blown lines and, not surprisingly, some of the nasty hits that the camera took from well-placed dodgeball throws by Stiller.<br /><br />Finally, there are two theatrical trailers.<br /><br />Dodgeball lives up to its subtitle by being a much better movie than it should have been. Sure, there is the requisite crude humour (gratuitous ball shots to the groin) but also right on the money parodies of fitness clubs and the fascination with sports that have no business being called such. Dodgeball is mindless entertainment but done in an engaging way that is a lot of fun to watch.</p></body></html>

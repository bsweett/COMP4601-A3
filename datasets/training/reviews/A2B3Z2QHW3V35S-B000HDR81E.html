I always try to get threw to my husband with needing his help and appreciate. When I don't get it I get mad and play games to get threw to him. Like Brooke did, just not the same games. I see now that playing those games aren't making things better between the two of us but pushing us apart. I'm going to try to learn from this movie. Thank goodness my husband sat down to watch this movie with me. Hopefully he will learn a thing or two from this movie too.</p></body></html>

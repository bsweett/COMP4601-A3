<meta name="summary" content="Had to start over after screen saver"></head><body><p>I bought the Blu-Ray set.  I agree - it is very hard to get the disks out and back in.  The video and audio are great.  But, the reason I am writing this review is because of what happened after I paused the movie for a while, and the screen saver kicked in.  I came back and hit "Pause" again, and a message popped up saying that was not allowed.  The same thing with the "Play" button.  I had to restart the movie from the beginning.</p></body></html>

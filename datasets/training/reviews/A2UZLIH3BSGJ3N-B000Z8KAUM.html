<meta name="summary" content="A dull film with the cheesy, casino, bar room jingle soundtrack"></head><body><p>Well, I'm not going to hammer this one to death because others have before me and I'd only be repeating what has been said. Ocean's 13 isn't much of an improvement over Ocean's 12, not by much at least. It was like watching a dull, dry documentary and it was difficult to pay attention. Much of the same jokes and cons were done again from the prior two films which contributed to the boredom. I found the bar room casino jazz soundtrack to play much like elevator music, it was monotonous and tiresome as well as the dialog. There wasn't anything terribly original about this third installment of the Ocean's 11 franchise/trilogy, in fact...as a viewer it was insulting. In my opinion, Ocean's 11 was and is the only film worthy of watching. It was a good reinvention of a classic which featured the original "Rat Pack".<br /><br />  Unfortunately Oceans 13 (just like Ocean's 12) suffer from what many other film franchises have before them. The lack of originality and what you have is a repeat of the same original film that did so well and was so entertaining, but flops in its retelling with only a few additions and tweaks to barely make a plot. I wouldn't rent this film, let alone Ocean's 12 ever again and I certainly wouldn't buy it. Despite the all star cast, many of who are actor's I enjoy seeing on screen, Ocean's 13 just doesn't have it, nor does it pack the punch promised from viewing the trailers early this past summer. This is just another example of how desperate Hollywood is and their drive to make a "quick buck" and the masses of people just follow like lemmings to plummet to their deaths.</p></body></html>

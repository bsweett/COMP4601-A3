<meta name="summary" content="A memorable call: chaos always wins..."></head><body><p>Well, it's one of those rare times where I'm finding myself siding against the naysayers, who in my opinion failed to not only get the point but to also enjoy this great film.<p>I'll start with the objections this film stimulated and i'll take it on from there.<br />  A lot of reviewers are asking why the sniper in the film is doing what he does to the man in the phone booth. But, that's a moot question folks, and it only proves that you're conditioned to believe that everything has a "logical" reason behind it. Newsflash: it doesnt. Remember the recent sniper incidents in Washington? What was the "logical" reason behind them? Or, what was the "logical" motive of those killers? Why do you accept irrationality in real life but yet you look for "reason" when this "irrationality" is shown to you in a film? You see the contradiction here?<p>  "Phone booth" is about a sniper who's picked out his next victim (he's already killed 2) after he's found out a few things about his life (mainly that he's a professional liar -media publicist - and that he's cheating on his wife). With this "ace" up his sleeve the sniper traps his victim in a phone booth by demonstrating to him that he, the sniper, is an expert shooter, and that he's enough over the edge to make due on his threats if the victim doesnt comply with the sniper's demands. Also, if not more importantly, the sniper threatens to reveal all the ill-doings of the victim to those that have been enduring his lies. With the threat of his marriage falling apart and with his whole career also threatened with destruction the victim is forced to play along in a game of life and death but cat and mouse as well..<p>  All this is layed-out in very convincing fashion by the scriptwriter and the director and it puzzles me that a few reviewers talk about plot-holes. Plot-holes? If someone can demonstrate to you that he's psychotic enough to gun you down for his own (whatever they might be) reasons and that he's good enough a shooter to manage it you would take your chances? You wouldnt be looking for such plotholes in real life, would you? Didnt think so.<br /><br />  This film is brillant on many plateaus if i may say so..First of all, the risky business of having the entire movie filmed from the perspective of a phone booth could've been a disaster in other hands but the whole film-team has done a great job preventing that from being the case.<p>  The plot moves quickly with constantly reinventing itself, as the threats take new twists and as the sniper keeps using his intimate knowledge of the secrets of his victim to corner him even more. The arrival of the police at the scene after the sniper kills someone who attempts to "boothjack" the phone booth adds a new dimension to the victim's helplessness as they think that he is the killer, and thus, the victim realises that he's now got 2 fronts to deal with.<p>  No need to go into the plot deeper. It will keep you watching unless you refuse (this time for YOUR own bizzare reasons to see that you'd be reacting in a very similar way in the victim's shoes in the film).<br />  What's actually even more effective about the film is the cast. That, in its turn, is surprising as Farrel (the trapped booth guy) pulls out a great performance in portraying the scummy type who earns a living by daily spreading lies and financing his superficial but expensive lifestyle from them.<br /><br />  But the show is actually stolen by the "voice" (Kiefer Sutherland). The voice has a tone that sounds, at the very least, super convincing about the threat it delivers. Firm, dark, sarcastic when needed and constantly ominous with a confidence that..kills, Kiefer is perfect being on the other end of the line. The "voice" is best when it talks about what drives it: and what drives it remains obscure till the end which i thought was the right way to go. At times the voice becomes the moral angel of death but before you can believe that it turns again into being a chaotic force that does what it does, well, because it..can! <p>  At a short, but steady and fast paced 80 minutes the "Phone booth" is actually amongst the top 3 thrillers of last year and one of the most intelligent recent films alltogether. Every element in it works and if there's one thing that seems to be taking the easy way out is the ending which i wont reveal here for obvious reasons. But even that is nothing that can subdue the power this film has.<br />  Great, great stuff.</p></body></html>

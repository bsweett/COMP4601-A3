This is by far one of the most entertaining films ever made.  Its got great action, great story (hey theres more story in this then anything from Stanley Kubrick or Akira Kurosawa), good performances (although they could have been alittle better), comedy, drama, suspense, great visuals, and thrills and fun to burn.  Unquestionably one of the best action films ever, and definetly one of the best times you can have watching a movie.  If you dont like this movie then you just dont like having a good time, so quit life (whats it worth livin for if you dont have fun).  9 out of a 10, cant wait for a sequel, and more from Sommers, he knows how to make an entertaining movie.</p></body></html>

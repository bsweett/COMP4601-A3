The plot's thin even for a movie musical, with murderess Velma going to jail for murdering her lover interspersed with musical numbers meant to show her dream of being a jazz star. It's simply choppy and downright DUMB. Either make a murder mystery or a jazz musical....putting both together just doesn't work, especially with a character nobody should have any sympathy for...an adulteress and killer who is completely brainless to boot. Don't waste your time.</p></body></html>

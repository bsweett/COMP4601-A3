<meta name="summary" content="An enjoyable, intelligent film"></head><body><p>A subtle, moody haunted house film, starring Nicole Kidman as a mother of two small children who moves to a musty country house to wait out the final days of the First World War, which has taken her husband away.  The house turns out to be a waystation for generations of ghosts; the script cleverly points out that haunting can work both ways.  I went into this film with low expectations and found myself pleasantly surprised.  Recommended!</p></body></html>

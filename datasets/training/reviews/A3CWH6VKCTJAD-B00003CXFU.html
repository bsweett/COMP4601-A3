<meta name="summary" content="Julia Roberts gives a breakout performance"></head><body><p>Julia Roberts outdoes herself in yet another David and Goliath struggle based on a true story.  Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a down-on-her-luck  mother of three who can't seem to hold down a job.  After having an auto  accident, she makes a bumpy transition from client to employee at the law  firm and stumbles onto a case with staggering implications.  It seems that  utility giant PG&amp;E has poisoned the groundwater and the local residents  are getting gravely ill.<p>The story starts poorly with scenes of Erin  looking for jobs and botching her accident case.  The first twenty minutes  of the film could have been condensed into five.  However, once the  investigation of the case begins, the story is engrossing.  It is a  powerful and well written human interest drama centered on a tough and  smart (though crude) woman who leads a passionate crusade on behalf of the  victims.<p>Director Steven Soderberg played it straight in filming this  after his extremely avant-garde effort in "The Limey".  His key strength  here was the direction of the actors with both Julia Roberts and Albert  Finney giving excellent interpretations of their characters.  However, my  only negative criticism of the film was the way Erin's boyfriend George was  presented.  George is a grubby tattoo covered biker (the tattoo on his left  shoulder says &quot;DIRTY&quot;) who behaves like Ward Cleaver with a  ponytail.  He is genteel, articulate, level headed, patient, sensitive and  kind.  All of this is so disconnected with his lifestyle that it seems  inconceivable that a character this wonderful could possibly come in this  package.<p>Julia Roberts' gave a superlative performance that smashed any  myth about her inability as a dramatic actor.  A far cry from her  accustomed lightweight romantic characters, her portrayal of Brockovich was  gritty, raw and audacious.  Emotionally, she commanded states from  manipulative vamp and vicious harpy to sympathetic confidant and indignant  crusader.  This is unquestionably her best performance and legitimizes her  as one of the more versatile actresses in Hollywood.<p>Albert Finney also  gave a fine performance as the bumbling but effective curmudgeon of a  lawyer.  He was simultaneously obnoxious and charming and created a good  contrast to Roberts' character.  The two of them had terrific  chemistry.<p>Aaron Eckhart was lovable as George, although as mentioned  above, the character's forbearing personality didn't jibe with his  rebellious culture.  However, I put more of the responsibility for this on  the director than on the actor.<p>The DVD has some excellent comments by  the real Erin Brockovich that lend credibility to the story.  However,  Brockovich is so toned down in these interviews, it makes Roberts'  portrayal seem like an exaggeration.  <p>This is an excellent story that is  well and believably dramatized.  I rated it an 8/10.  For viewers who enjoy  strong dramatic performances and who are not offended by liberal profanity,  I recommend it highly.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This would have been the best action comedy of the summer"></head><body><p>In &quot;The Rundown,&quot; the Rock plays a &quot;retrieval expert&quot; named Beck, whom we first meet when he has to get either $50,000 or a ring as collateral from a NFL quarterback (Stephen Bishop), who is hanging out at a club with some of his teammates.  When his initial overture is rebuffed, Beck checks in with his boss, pointing out that the QB has his entire offensive line with him.  But the concern is not over the obstacle that these hulking gridiron giants might pose to him, but that the team has a chance to make the playoffs again.  The clear implication is that if Beck gets rough, the boys will be out of commission, and the tone he takes shows that the Rock has found the perfect note for creating his big screen persona.  <p>This is just the prologue to the main adventure, which is when Beck is sent to the Amazonian jungle to retrieve Travis Walker (Seann William Scott), the wayward son of his employer.  If Beck does this he can pay off his own debt and get the startup money for his dream: a restaurant.  Travis is looking for the Gatto, a legendary ancient artifact made of gold.  Unfortunately he is doing this on the land owned by the evil Hatcher, who is exploiting the natives right and left.  Hatcher is played by Christopher Walken, who has another one of those legendary moments in his career when he tries to explain the idea of the tooth fairy to his troops through an interpreter.  There has to be a woman in this type of movie, and here the lady is Mariana (Rosario Dawson), who does a lot more than tend the local bar.  Basically, everybody wants Travis and/or the Gatto, complicating Beck's life, and that is before we throw those fun loving jungle monkeys into the mix.  <p>The Rock sets the tone for the film, Scott supplies the comic relief, Walken has fun chewing on the luscious scenery, and Dawson provides the brains and beauty.  Scott takes a half-step back from the quantum leap forward he took in &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot; in getting beyond the Stifler character from the &quot;American Pie&quot; movies, but he holds his own against the Rock.  It will certainly be interesting in the future to how both actors can build on what they have established here.  The film takes as much effort to set up the comedy sequences as the action ones, which is why the end result is pretty solid.<p>My only serious complaint with &quot;The Rundown&quot; is that the action sequences consist of a series of rapid jump cuts, which probably help to cover up the wires and mirrors and whatnot, but which also make it rather difficult to follow the action.  I understand this is the current language of cinema, a legacy spawned by music videos and fast paced commercials, put sometimes I just want a nice minute long tracking shot or to just have the camera stay put for a while.  But director Peter Berg certainly brings some flair to the proceedings.  <p>&quot;The Rundown&quot; is the best action-comedy of the fall, which is not exactly the most desirable honor to be won in Hollywood and rather surprising.  You would think a film that takes place in the jungles of Amazon (filmed in Hawaii) would be a natural to put out in the summer, but I guess that would make too much sense.  This is not a great action film, but it is a solid one, which is apparently the best we can hope for nowadays.  The title does not have any real meaning, besides initially paralleling the name of the film's star.  Producers ditched &quot;Helldorado&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Jungle,&quot; which probably explains why the television spots are talking about the Rock rather than the film's title.</p></body></html>

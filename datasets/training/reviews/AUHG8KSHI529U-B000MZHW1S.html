<meta name="summary" content="Sierra Leone in the 1990s would have made Hell Seem Like a Great Vacation Spot"></head><body><p>This is a very powerful movie that wears its political views on its sleeve.  However, the performances are so good and the story so well done that I didn't really mind being manipulated even as I knew what the writers and director were trying to do to me.  They simply did it and it worked.  Of course, the movie wants us to become aware of the issue of "blood diamonds" or "conflict diamonds" and the hell on earth they finance.  When the movie ends we are all supposed to be committed to being sure that any diamonds we buy are not had at the cost of enslaving, maiming, or killing other human beings.  However, the story communicates this on the sides of the main story which centers on a single large and very rare stone worth many millions of dollars that almost no one can afford.<br /><br />The country of Sierra Leone has a tortured history.  It was among the first countries through which slaves bound for North America were purchased in the seventeenth century.  After 1787, Britain founded Freetown much as America founded Liberia, as a place of return for freed slaves. And while it served as the seat for the British rule in the area, its ethnic diversity (at least 18 different groups) has led to nearly constant struggles and fighting.  Its English speaking university, Fourah Bay College, has attracted English speaking Africans from all over the West Coast of Africa.<br /><br />The politics of the period of the movie in the early 1990s are hard to understand because of its sheer complexity.  The movie basically digests it into the Government forces and the RUF (Revolutionary United Front), however, in real life there were additional factions.  The point is that the Solomon Vandy character just wanted to live his life as a fisherman with his family and didn't want to get caught up in any of this gangsterism masquerading as government.<br /><br />The movie centers on a Rhodesian named Danny Archer (superbly done by Leonardo DiCaprio) whose homelessness (because Rhodesia became Zimbabwe and because he lost his parents when very young) is an important theme in the movie.  Is he of Africa or is he a foreigner who doesn't belong?  He has lived by his wits and his ability to fight.  When the movie begins he is a diamond smuggler with all the hazards of that trade.<br /><br />The other important story is about the aforementioned Solomon Vandy (powerfully portrayed by Djimon Hounsou) who is a simple fisherman with a wonderful family that has largely avoided the troubles.  His boy, Dia, is going to school and the family has dreams of him becoming a doctor.  Then the RUF gangs come to his village and their life will never be the same.  In the confusion, the family is fragmented into three groups with none of them knowing the whereabouts of the others or even if they live.  Solomon is actually fortunate to become enslaved working at finding diamonds for the RUF gang.  Solomon finds a huge pink stone that becomes the focus of the movie once he tries to secret it out.  Everyone wants that stone.  Everyone.  And it is that stone that brings all the elements of the rest of the story together.<br /><br />The love interest, such as it is, is supplied by the danger seeking and passionate Maddy Bowen (played just right by Jennifer Connelly).  She is there to find out the story and helps us understand the whole blood diamond trade as well as tease out the background story of Danny Archer.<br />I cannot share any more of the story because you should see it on your own. The hellishness of Sierra Leone during this time is powerfully portrayed on the screen.  If Pittsburgh in the nineteenth century was rightly called "Hell With the Lid Off", Sierra Leone in the 1990s would have made Hell look like a vacation resort.<br /><br />See it.</p></body></html>

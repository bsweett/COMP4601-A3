<meta name="summary" content="The Italian Job"></head><body><p>What a terrific movie! "The Italian Job" was one of the best movies of the summer of 2003. There has not been a re-make like this one in years! This film is blessed with a brilliant script, solid cast of skilled actors (Seth Green was hilarious), breathtaking scenery and fabulous, realistic stunts. The pace is perfect - it moves slow enough to keep you following the story, but fast enough to make it interesting. The story is crafted in a way to make it completely believable, but still leaves you scratching your head thinking "How is that POSSIBLE?" To anyone looking for a nice change from the mundane, often brainless movies released, "The Italian Job" will get the job done.</p></body></html>

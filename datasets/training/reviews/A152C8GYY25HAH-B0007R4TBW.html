<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding American independent movie"></head><body><p>First-time director Zach Braff also stars in and wrote the screenplay for "Garden State", 2004's most original and charming American romantic comedy after "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". The movie is a little uneven - some of the scenes do not work as well as others. Overall, though, it is a satisfying delight. And I doubt any recent movie addresses the angst of contemporary twentysomethings as well as this one does.<br /><br />Andrew Largeman [Braff] is an aspiring actor living in Los Angeles. He works as a waiter in a trendy restaurant. He hasn't been home to New Jersey in nine years, but when his wheelchair-bound Mom dies, he has no choice but to return. There, he reunites uncomfortably with his psychiatrist father [Ian Holm]. He meets up with his childhood buddies, most of who seem to have met dead ends in life. The one who has `succeeded' by making a fortune has found a dead end of his own. Along the way, Andrew meets a very unique girl [Natalie Portman]. Something in her awakens a part of him, something which, because of his very unfortunate childhood, has long been dormant. But is it too late? Can Andrew, who has survived on anti-depressants and therapy for a dozen years, break free and become himself for the first time?<br /><br />The cast is sublime and manages to override all of the mostly minor script deficiencies. The music is exceptionally appropriate.<br /><br />For everyone who has ever been estranged from their roots, then found a route home, "Garden State" is a real find.</p></body></html>

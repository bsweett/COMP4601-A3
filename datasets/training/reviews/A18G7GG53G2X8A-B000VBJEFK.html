<meta name="summary" content="If Rat Can Cook, You Can, Too"></head><body><p>Rats have always been associated with filth: they live in sewers; they eat out of the garbage; they've probably been exposed to a disease. Is it any wonder that we cringe at the thought of a rat touching the food we eat? One of the things that makes Disney/Pixar's "Ratatouille" so interesting is that this idea is intentionally turned on its head: it's about a rat with a passion for food and a talent for cooking. This story is told with charm, style, and a generous dose of humor, made even better through wonderful animation and decent voice work. I won't go so far as to say that this is the greatest Disney/Pixar film ever made, but I will say that--like all that have come before it--it's a well made film that's a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />This film cleverly breaks a clear distinction between humans and non-humans, the kind that was first demonstrated in "Toy Story." In that film, the toys' cardinal rule was to never let a human see them walk and talk. Humans have come to believe that toys are inanimate objects; they will never be able to accept anything different. "Ratatouille" opens with the same basic principle: a rat can never interact with a human. Humans think that rats are dirty, vile creatures; they will never think otherwise. Or would they? The story centers on the unlikely relationship between a rat--Remy (Patton Oswalt)--and a human--Linguini (Lou Romano)--a relationship that clearly violates the rules of species interaction. Both characters are motivated by the desire to prove something.<br /><br />Most of the film takes place in the kitchen of a troubled Parisian restaurant that was once worthy of five stars. This is where Remy winds up after being separated from his clan (the end result of a trigger-happy old woman ridding her house of vermin). This is dream come true for the little rat; Remy has always appreciated food, from the smells to the flavors to the various combinations of ingredients. He was born to be a chef. While trying to escape from the kitchen, he gets distracted by a pot of soup in desperate need of assistance. As he adds the final ingredient, he's caught by Linguini, a stumbling, bumbling wreck recently hired as a garbage collector. While he's able to prevent Remy from being seen, he's too late to prevent the soup from being served. But to everyone's surprise, the soup is a big hit with the customers.<br /><br />Later that night, when alone, Remy and Linguini discover that they can communicate with each other. This is good news for Linguini; the restaurant staff believed that he cooked the wonderful soup, and the head chef--the tiny, high-strung, power-hungry Skinner (Ian Holm)--wants him to cook it again the next day. This is when Linguini and Remy form a secret partnership: Remy will be the brains behind the recipes, and Linguini will physically cook the meals.<br /><br />This sets into motion the more comedic portions of the film, portions highlighted by Remy's literal puppetry of Linguini. While hiding underneath a toque, Remy is able to manipulate Linguini's arms by pulling locks of his hair. I don't think I fully appreciated the slapstick nature of these scenes; hidden beneath the talking animals and formulaic plot is a story that's more mature. I greatly appreciated the themes of friendship and cooperation, and I certainly enjoyed the developing relationship between Linguini and the aggressive yet vulnerable Colette (Janeane Garofalo). But when it comes to the comical results of Remy's puppetry, something was lacking. Maybe it was the fact that Linguini had already been established as a funny character. Nothing further was needed.<br /><br />But that's my only real criticism of "Ratatouille." The rest of the film is pleasing and light, as is expected of all family-oriented animated films. Some of the best moments involve Remy's conversations with the imaginary spirit of Gusteau (Brad Garrett), a world-class chef and founder of the restaurant. He appears whenever Remy needs a pep talk, specifically when it comes to the assertion that anyone can be a cook if he or she is in the right mindset. This character acts as a counterpoint to Remy's father, Django (Brian Dennehy), who's always unsupportive and unsatisfied. He would prefer to see his son eat garbage and avoid human contact like every other rat. But Remy is independent, and he's determined to show his father that (a) not all humans are bad, and (b) that he can make something of himself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, doing so will mean having to work with Linguini, who's now letting the restaurant's success go to his head. Making matters even worse is Skinner; not only does he suspect Remy's involvement, he also panics at the prospect of Linguini taking ownership of the restaurant (for reasons I won't reveal). The biggest obstacle for all the characters is food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), a sinister and somehow ghoulish old man. Many years ago, he wrote a scathing review of the restaurant, forcing it to drop one of its stars (another was dropped when Gusteau died). The restaurant's recent rise in popularity has come to his attention, as has the publicity surrounding Linguini. Using every mannerism of a horror movie villain, Ego personally challenges Linguini to prepare a dish worthy of a good review.<br /><br />Thus, the groundwork is laid for the film's ending, which is just as amusing as it is far fetched. But plausibility doesn't even come into play here; this is a fun-filled animated film, perfect for children and generally well suited for adults. No one will care that a language barrier between French and English was completely ignored. No one will mind that only certain characters speak with a French accent. "Ratatouille" was appropriately crafted so that Remy, Linguini, and their fateful partnership will be all anyone cares about.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dedicated to the memory of JFK,1917-1963"></head><body><p>Ladies and gentlemen,citizens,it is with humble respect that director Oliver Stone presents the investigation of the death of a great American,John Fitzgerald Kennedy,the 35th President of the United States. It was Stone's hope and intention,that this courtroom epic,which runs for approximately three and a half hours,will become a living memory and an inspiration to both current and future generations. Kevin Costner is Jim Garrison,a district attorney who represents Lee Harvey Oswald who was accused of Kennedy's November 22,1963 assassination in Dallas. Sissy Spacek is Jim's wife. This film also features special appearances by Kevin Bacon and the late John Candy. Unlike Kennedy,then-Texas governor(now deceased) John B. Connolly survived the shooting although he was wounded. I dedicate this film to the memory of Kennedy and the surviving members of his family. Stone should make epics about the lives and post-presidency deaths of Lyndon B. Johnson,Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan. I'm sure Nixon and Reagan saw this film(they were both alive in 1991 when this film was theatrically released). I'm also sure that Gerald Ford,Jimmy Carter,Bill Clinton,George W. Bush and Bush's father saw this film also.</p></body></html>

Not much is lost in the hi-def 2-D version now available. There are sweeping vistas, believable characters and a majestic sense of flying with the dragons.<br /><br />The story is simple. Hiccup, a young Viking, defies tradition by befriending a deadly foe, a ferocious dragon he calls Toothless.  Together they must fight tradition and find a way to save both their worlds.<br /><br />Superbly designed in all aspects -- the characters, the world and the story come together to create a wondrously entertaining diversion for all ages.  I don't say that loosely.</p></body></html>

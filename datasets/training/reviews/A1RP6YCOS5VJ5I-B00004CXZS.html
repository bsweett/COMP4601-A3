Ricardo Montalban returns once again to reprise his role as Khan, the villain from the original series episode "Space Seed". As expected, Montalban exceeds in this role that he has established as one of the greatest villains of the Trek universe. He looks different, a little buffer and more grey, but he is still the same evil character we have all come to hate.<br /><br />This movie features a lot of interesting and very famous moments. This was also the first film appearance of Kirstie Alley. The story is very compelling and the characters/actors work so well together, you can feel their friendships and hatreds between each other. If you notice during the movie, they do give hints by things they say and do of how the movie will end. The script is well written and has me in tears every time, no matter how many times it is watched. This is a must have for lovers of Trek and sci-fi, you have to see this movie at least once in your life time. After that, you will want to see it again and again. It is just that good.</p></body></html>

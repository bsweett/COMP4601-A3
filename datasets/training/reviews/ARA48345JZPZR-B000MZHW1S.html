<meta name="summary" content="TIA..."></head><body><p>You should know that, first and foremost, Blood Diamond is an action/adventure movie, complete with astounding escapes, chases, implausible coincidence, violence, and the like.  It is also very well done on that level, with Edward Zwick ably handling the pure adrenaline rush of the action.<br /><br />But Zwick's film is also set in the context of the tragedy of conflict diamonds amidst civil war, and the horror seemingly endlessly perpetrated upon poor civilian populations by "men with guns", or in this instance, often "children with guns".<br /><br />What can one say about the misery of so much of Africa?  So much of the world, really.  When confronted by the seeming contradictions of life in war torn Sierra Leone, discos and rap music and hand amputations and 10 year olds with AK-47's, one character's answer is "TIA" i.e. "This is Africa".<br /><br />The diamond trade is not happy with this film, and I can see why.  The fact that the  monopoly controls the market so effectively to keep the price up, and the fact that such an easily tranportable wealth means keeping "conflict diamonds", the blood diamonds of the title, from supplying the arms for more violence over their control near impossible. When the journalist, played by Jennifer Connelly, says "if people knew the cost of a diamond is an arm, they wouldn't buy them" I wondered if that were so.<br /><br />I think the sorrow of the film is heightened by the natural beauty of the place, filmed wonderfully.  The cast is fine.  Leonardo DeCaprio is very good here.  Djimon Housou brings an inherent dignity to his role, one that seems to be present in all his work.  Jennifer Connelly always embodies intelligence along with her beauty (and I don't know how she manages to get even better looking as time goes on, but she does).<br /><br />A very fast and furious action film with a lot of other things on its mind, I found the film well worthwhile.</p></body></html>

Only they don't call HIM the killer; they just refer to some of the handy work he seems to have left behind and this addiction keeps him killing. He doesn't like to do it, mind you, going to AA meetings because he is trying to keep his addiction in check. Still, an addiction is an addiction is an addiction and relapses to occur. His latest relapse, a dancer he sees and her lover, change things when something changes in his pattern.<br />Namely, a loose end comes to visit and builds a world within his world by asking him to show off what killing is made of.<br />And that's where things get started.<br /><br />When I first rented the movie, I didn't expect that much. Costner is oftentimes hit-or-miss and, frankly, I was afraid he would miss in this role. Happily I have to say I was wrong, with Costner making an excellent killer and also kicking it in a dual role. One of the many things Costner showcases in this movie is the way he can play with the mentality within a role - here Mr. Brooks has an imaginary friend we are lucky enough to see and the two of them share laughs and plans and suspicions on what is what. Honestly these are some of the best scenes in the business, making you really like Mr. Brooks and appreciate his humor. Costner does great work making Mr. Brooks a sympathetic character, too, with his murderous life balanced well by a family he sees to really love.<br /><br />Along the way, we pick up a counterpart to Costner, one Demi Moore, and she does some good work in this venture, too. I was equally surprised by this because I didn't expect to be able to take her seriously in any sort of way as an officer, much less an officer with a plethora of secrets. One of those things is a little bit of a distraction, mind you, one called The Hangman, but that just seems to be a little piece of a giant puzzle trying to keep the audience engaged.<br />I'm glad the writers at least remembered that Mr. Brooks was the focal point of the tale.<br /><br />For people wanting some hardcore murder, this is a mainstream piece and doesn't offer up a thick helping of doom. It does have its moments and it does have its beauty, and it should still offer up something to that side of the spectrum. People who don't like graphic horror should be able to keep on keeping on with their watching, able to love Costner and able to watch some death together.<br />I liked the movie - it had a lot to give to - and think people should check it out.</p></body></html>

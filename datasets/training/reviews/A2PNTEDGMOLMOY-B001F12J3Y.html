<meta name="summary" content="Visual extravaganza still has a sweet Christmas message at its heart"></head><body><p>Christmas makes saps of us all, and if Hollywood knows how to do anything it's how to make a few nickels from our sappery - how else can you explain Playboy bunny Jenny McCarthy having not one but two holiday movies playing on The Family Channel (!) this year?<br /><br />So it was only a matter of time before America's most beloved movie star, Tom Hanks, found his way into America's most beloved holiday.  Re-teaming with Robert Zemeckis (they previously worked together on two little independent films you might have seen, "Forrest Gump" and "Cast Away"), Hanks gets to play five different roles thanks to motion-capture technology and Zemeckis's desire to push digital filmmaking to new frontiers.  It's a bit of a distraction for the adults who keep trying to find Tom Hanks in the various digital characters, but since it's Tom Hanks we don't care too much (we also don't care that his train conductor's Chicago accent ebbs and flows like the tide).<br /><br />But "The Polar Express" is a kids movie and should be judged accordingly.  On that level, "TPE" is a near-triumph.  Our hero, an unnamed boy of around 10-12 years old, is doubting Santa on Christmas Eve.  He is old enough to spot the chinks in Santa's armor he is in danger of Not Believing In Santa.  Then, as he searches for slumber on Christmas Eve, a huge old-fashioned locomotive pulls up in front of his house, somewhat shocking because there are no train tracks.  He reluctantly climbs aboard and is off on an adventure of a lifetime, rocketing down the tracks towards the North Pole along with several other kids in various stages of Christmas skepticism.<br /><br />Visually, "TPE" is a stunner, whether it's capturing the beauty of a winter countryside, churning your stomach as the train shoots down a 179-degree grade at Glacier Gulch, or meandering through Santa's charming red-brick home town at the North Pole.  This is animation that's one step away from reality, in a good way.<br /><br />Sure, there are some glitches.  A quick song-and-dance number serves as a reminder (along with Richard Gere's performance in "Chicago") that not all movie stars are ready for musicals.  The Josh Groban ballad "Believe" gets a little tired, and the appearance of Steven Tyler from Aerosmith as an elf to sing "Rockin' on Top of the World" reeks of a blatant attempt to increase soundtrack sales.<br /><br />All things considered, while "TPE" is not going to knock either the Grinch (cartoon version) or "A Christmas Story" from their perches  as the top Christmas movies, it's a proud addition to the family DVD library - a welcome excuse to ignore the latest holiday pseudo-entertainment from secondary "talents" like Ms. McCarthy.</p></body></html>

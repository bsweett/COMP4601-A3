I also avoided anything with Ben Stiller after several of his unfunny stinkbombs.  He really needs to be more picky with his scripts because he is a genuinely funny guy (check out "The Ben Stiller Show" to see that).<br /><br />But Stiller is very funny in DODGEBALL, along with everyone else.  I wish there had been more Stephen Root and Rip Torn.  I also loved Hank Azaria's spoof of old educational films on the history of Dodgeball.  After OLD SCHOOL and this movie, Vince Vaughn is becoming the Bill Murray of his generation.<br /><br />Most of this movie is predictable and derivative but it keeps the laughs coming.<br /><br />Funny, funny stuff.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

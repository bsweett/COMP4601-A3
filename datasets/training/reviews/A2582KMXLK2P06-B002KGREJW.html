It's a slow start, probably because you're supposed to be introduced to all the characters.  The boredom continues while the family sits at the dinner table eating chicken.  But, as soon as this scene is over, the movie improves drastically.<br /><br />As you've heard by now, Little Miss Sunshine is about a dysfunctional family who has to travel to a beauty pageant together for their 7-year old daughter.  Each member of the family has their own wacky problems, and you will find out about them as the movie rolls along.  You have to be patient and pay attention or else it won't seem like a very funny  move.  Trust me, it is.  Good writing truly makes this movie a winner.</p></body></html>

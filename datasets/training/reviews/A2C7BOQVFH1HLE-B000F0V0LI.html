<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable Western!  Great Background Scenery! Bad DVD Version!"></head><body><p>This is a very enjoyable Western because it has the essential elements of great leading man, John Wayne, and great genre director, John Ford.  Jeffery Hunter was also very good here although my all-time favourite role of his comes much later and just before his untimely death as Capt. Christopher Pike of the Starship Enterprise.  I have always thought that of all the captains of the Enterprise, although his tenure was the briefest, he was the best actor of the lot.<br /><br />This film though has one of the most breathtaking scenery ever and makes full use of the colour medium to produce optimal results.  Monument Valley was an inspired locale to shoot this film and although the screenplay isn't the best with some awkward moments especially in the clumsy attempts at interjecting humour at various points that just didn't quite take, this is more than made up for with great camera work and great acting.  John Wayne is very convincing as a bigoted and racist bitter Confederate soldier who takes surrender and losing very hard who over the course of the film learns from Jeffery Hunter and his own observations to change his world view and becomes compassionate and less bigoted in the end.<br /><br />Overall, this is still although not a perfect picture a very, very good representative of the Western genre and like a true classic bears up well to repeated viewing.<br /><br />The only problem is with this version of the DVD which is very shabbily put together and is very poor.  The picture quality is terrible having not been restored and white spots and other imperfections abound on both sides i.e. Standard and pseudo-Widescreen versions although the few short documentaries on the bonus features were okay.  The only redeeming factor which warrants 2 stars is the excellent sound quality that comes in Dolby Digital and is clear and at a nice consistent volume level throughout.  Certainly one of the best dvds of an older film sound quality wise that I've seen.<br /><br />I notice that a Blu-ray version of this film has been released and as I haven't seen it, I hope that that version would have addressed the issues I brought up above.  My recommendation is to give this version a miss and check out the hopefully vastly improved picture quality of the Blu-ray version or wait for a much better improved standard version with a properly done widescreen format to become available.  Just give this dvd version a very, very wide berth.</p></body></html>

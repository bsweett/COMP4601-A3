It only works if you don't think too long on certain aspects of the film, purposely designed for reaction, not contemplation.  But.  There was a lot to question (plot-holes, if you will).  And it was these craters I kept falling into, saying to myself, wait a minute, that doesn't make any sense.  The greatest example of this is returning people to a segment of London, supposedly clean, while just a few blocks away there were still bodies lying around.  Health issues aside...how do you keep people from roaming into unsanitary areas (which they didn't, two strayed)?  The BIG question being, why the rush to return people to an unsafe area, other than providing the story with a very convenient reason for mayhem to follow/continue.  AND, how did the dad (Robert Carlyle) happen to have the unerring knack of finding them no matter where there went/hid?  That went well beyond convenient and into the arena of being just a plot ploy.<br />I was also a little put off by the obvious distain for Americans, the military in general, by the filmmakers.  It wasn't necessary to the plot so one suspects a little bias on their part.  I wanted action, not political commentary.<br />The gem of this piece had to be the candlelight dinner sequence in the dark house that abruptly turns into mad flight in a blast of daylight.  That, and the helicopter showdown.  Wow.<br />So what's next, 28 Months Later?  I'd buy it.</p></body></html>

I viewed it with 3 others and we felt as if the first half dragged on and on.  The scene where the protaganist revolts and tricks her rapist is very toned down in the American release as compared with the Swedish version and not nearly as powerful or surprising.  The acting is all fine and the desaturatied colors fit the bleakness of the characters and story lines but there is little use of your surrounds made in this very dialouge driven film.  There were certainly many scenes such as the motorcycle being driven on the roads that could have made use of your 5.1 theater system.  The video transfer is fairly free of noise and rates a 4, the audio a 2.  The film itself, especially when compared with the Swedish version is a 2 at best.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you.

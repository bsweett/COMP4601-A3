<meta name="summary" content="A timeless Jewel heist gone wrong"></head><body><p>Quentin Tarrintino is an amazing talent when it comes to making movies, and ALL of his movies are great<br /><br /> but this (His first) is my favorite. His style is so hip and unique, and the characters always unforgettable!<br /><br />Reservoir Dogs is basically the story of a jewel heist gone wrong.<br /><br />The movie opens in a coffee shop with the gangsters eating breakfast right before the heist takes place.<br /><br />The funny part about it is the discussion taking place at the table, about Madonna's song "Like a virgin".<br /><br />We have the boss, his son (Nice guy Eddie)and the color-coded named criminals (the boss gave them the names because they don't know each each other, and boss wants to keep it that way)<br /><br />We have Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink (my fave)<br /><br />What is interesting about this is, that after they leave the restaurant, we immediately flash to a car with Mr. White driving and Orange in the back - shot - blood all over the place!<br /><br />They go to a warehouse and all meet up there, and as they begin to trickle in, one by one, it is realized that someone set them up-one of them!<br /><br />But which one? Which one is the cop ???<br /><br />They re forced to stay in the warehouse and wait it out, and 'honor among thieves' is put to the test.Tempers flare and blood is shed.But who ratted? And how will they get out alive?<br /><br />One thing that makes this so unique is that it sort of plays backwards, and Tarrintino was pretty much the first to use this style of storytelling.<br /><br /> Another thing, the soundtrack is awesome!You will never forget what happens as "Stuck in the middle with you" plays. :(<br /><br />There are a lot of awesome oldies which plays on the movie's 'radio station'  "K-Billy Super sounds of the seventies".<br /><br />There are many editions of this movie out, but the 15th anniversary edition is really PACKED with extras, and the packaging is cool too.<br /><br />The 2 disc set comes in a slim metal "gas can" and the top pops off. Inside is a huge book of matches that hold the DVD's, the matches are from "Uncle Bob's Pancakes"... It really is a cool edition to own, even if you own the 10th anniversary, or other editions.<br /><br />Highly reccomended entertainment!</p></body></html>

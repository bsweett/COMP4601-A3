Recent examples include Steven Soderbergh and the "Oceans 11-12" films, F.F. Coppola and "Bram Stoker's Dracula" and the "Rainmaker" as well as Spike Lee  and "25 Hours."<br /><br />Results have been mostly good ("BS Dracula) and not so good ("25 Hours"). But nonetheless, quality directors, despite the material, always elevate it by way of their personal point of view and sterling story-telling techniques.<br /><br />Spike Lee, director of the sublime "Malcolm X" directs this film, "Inside Man," basically a bank heist film, and elevates it to, if not Art, then to a mostly exciting, well crafted thriller with terrific performances by the always reliable Denzel as NYC Hostage Negotiator, Keith Frazier and Clive Owen as Bank Robber, Dalton Russell. The only problematic performance comes from the luminous Jodie Foster as a kind of go to woman who has friends in high places, whose actual profession is murky but who is very well paid for her service. The problem is her role is not well thought out and written and though Foster cannot help but have her special moments, she cannot get her arms and remarkable talent around this role.<br /><br />Directing from a good script by Russell Gewirtz, "Inside Man" is a fun, interesting, well-made popular entertainment that almost always keeps your mind and eyes interested.</p></body></html>

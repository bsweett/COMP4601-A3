<meta name="summary" content="EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN Rocks!"></head><body><p>EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN is the highly anticipated sequel to the infamouse cult original THE EVIL DEAD. This film starts out almost as if it will be a remake of the original: Ash and his new girlfriend (?) are driving up to the same cabin in the woods and once again play the tape recording of spells that will summon the dead to possess the living. But this time, Ash takes charge and actually wants to battle the demons that are alway trying to possess him. This film is 50% horror and 50% comedy, and much better made than the original.</p></body></html>

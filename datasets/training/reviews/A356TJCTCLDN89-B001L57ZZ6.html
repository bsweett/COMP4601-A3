<meta name="summary" content="HAL has a cousin and she's mean"></head><body><p>Jerry is a loser. Rachel is a single mother. They both get phone calls ordering them to do stuff or Rachel's child is going to die. The lady on the phone has other terrified slaves, a music shop owner, a jewler, a TSA worker, a Chinese tour bus group and an FBI agent. All these people are cogs in a wild plan to fix a political problem. If you saw 2001, watched the Daystrom episode of Star Trek or watched the Terminator then you probably sighed when the big denouncement came up. Parts of the movie are okay and parts are ridiculous. Jerry has to run like a sprinter champion, jump like a diver, pull a gun on professionals and fight a guy who should've been able to break him like a twig. The body count in this movie is so high that there must be hundreds of folks dead or injured in Jerry and Rachel's wake.<br />Eagle Eye is one of those flicks that is best for sitting on the couch eating popcorn and talking back to the screen. Unless you want to own every movie that Billy Bob Thornton has appeared in or if you really, really like looking at Shia then don't bother to buy this.</p></body></html>

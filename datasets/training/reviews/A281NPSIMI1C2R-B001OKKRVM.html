Summer brings freedom as penguins fly through underwater worlds and in the winter, they take on an amazing task of keeping their eggs safe from the frigid temperatures.<br /><br />My respect for penguins was dramatically increased as I watched them form partnerships and then take on a world of challenges. Watching this with a sense of awe may be an understatement. There is something stunning about the commitment the penguin parents enter into in order to bring new life into the world. The male and female penguins play an equal role in the parenting process and their dedication is beyond impressive. For the most part, this documentary focuses on surviving the winter, but the scenes of the baby penguins are well worth waiting for.<br /><br />The way this is filmed, you truly gain a sense of the emotions of the penguins and you can almost see the sheer wonder of the parenting experience in the eyes of the parents. What I loved most was the way the little penguins sing to the parents and how they communicate with their friends. The sadness of the penguins who don't manage to keep their eggs safe is tangible. As they return to the sea, you can't help but feel their loss.<br /><br />Overall, you have to go into this with realistic expectations because this is about the reality of survival. March of the Penguins presents this reality, yet it also presents an emotional dimension that will give you a renewed respect for penguins. The leopard seal in this movie reminded me of the one in 8 Below (which I felt was initially more upsetting than this movie) and they are truly terrifying. This movie does seem to have been created with an adult audience in mind, so you may want to preview this before showing it to your children.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review</p></body></html>

This movie was excellent.  John Jarrett was so friendly at first, until he gets the kids to his lair, they all go to sleep, and wake up to an utter hell.  I do agree with the reviewers that were amazed the one girl returns (after successfully escaping!) to find a car, if it had been me, I'd have gotten the hell outta there on foot, but..  no movie would have been there then.  Recommended for any horror fan!</p></body></html>

What surprised me about this movie was that there was hardly any dialogue.  It's sort of like watching a modern-day silent movie.<br /><br />I knew this would be a story about Captain John Smith and Pocahontas.  However, I just didn't realize just how slow it would be for a movie that is a little over 2 hours long.<br /><br />English men land in Virginia and immediately form a "relationship" with the Naturals.  There's an interesting contrast of these two groups.  The Naturals are at ease compared to the English.  Of course, things go wrong when the English start to take over the land little by little.<br /><br />When Newton returns to English, things go from bad to worse in Virginia.  Smith is captured by the Naturals.  However, instead of killing him, they let him live among them...with the help of Pocahontas.  Of course, against the wish of the king, Pocahontas and Smith eventually fall in love.<br /><br />From here on to the end, the story gets a little odd.  This is where you just might lose attention or fall asleep.  The dialogue becomes less frequent as well.<br /><br />This movie could have been shortened and used a bit more dialogue.  Maybe you'll love it or maybe you won't.  I just know that it was so-so for me.</p></body></html>

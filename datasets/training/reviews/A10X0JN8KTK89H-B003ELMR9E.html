<meta name="summary" content="A Drama in Thriller's Clothing"></head><body><p>Sleep disorders are not new to murder mysteries, but the way Christopher Nolan represents insomnia visually is at least as wonderful as Al Pacino's patient acting.  Pacino plays a detective from L.A., Will Dormer, who is sent to Alaska to help out an old friend with a murder case.  Dormer and his partner (played by Martin Donovan) are under investigation by Internal Affairs in L.A., so there's more to this temporary transfer than assisting a fellow badge.<br /><br />In Alaska, it's light all day and every day when Dormer and his partner arrive, and Dormer has insomnia.  Pacino gradually slows his character's actions and reactions down until I felt that he was severely debilitated and in danger.  He makes mistakes: some deliberate, others on accident, and still others he isn't sure of.  The latter make for the most intriguing part of this well-constructed thriller.<br /><br />Hillary Swank plays the smart, plucky detective, Ellie Burr, who is stuck serving misdemeanors instead of actual collars.  She has studied Dormer's career and admires him.  Swank plays the role without overreaching.  I cannot say the same for Pacino.  Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Jack Nicholson all suffer from the same affliction: As great as they are as actors, their personalities are greater.  I cannot watch them in films and pretend that they are anyone but themselves.  I still enjoy their performances, but they are decidedly bigger than any of the characters they have ever played.  They just can't help it.<br /><br />Maura Tierney gives an excellent but thankless performance as the front desk clerk (or manager) of the hotel where Dormer and his partner stay.  She softens Pacino in a way that Swank is unable to do.  Or maybe Pacino tempers himself; it's hard to tell.<br /><br />Robin Williams, as Walter Finch, is quite excellent at being creepy.  The banter between Finch and Dormer is something of a throwback to a different time: "You're my job," says Dormer when Finch maneuvers for sympathy.  They seem to know each other as if from across the room, not like lovers, but like familiar character types in a familiar story.<br /><br />And Nolan isn't trying to do anything entirely new in Insomnia.  He's telling you a story you already know.  He twists it slightly with great visual effects and a cold, blue camera lens.  As much as I enjoy the film, it's not perfect.  The screenplay is written into a corner, and the ending is easy to see a mile away.  Likewise, some of the dialogue between Dormer and Finch is heavy-handed and cheesy.<br /><br />At its heart, this is the story of a downfall.  Don't judge the film by its murder/mystery/suspense genre tag.  Character takes precedence over plot.  It's not as good as Nolan's Memento, but Nolan's craft leaves its marks.</p></body></html>

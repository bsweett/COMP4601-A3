<meta name="summary" content="What?  Where's The Prestige?"></head><body><p>This film came out before another magic film which I believe to be one of the best of the year, The Prestige.  That movie seemed to have everything that this movie didn't.  Not to say that this isn't a good movie because it is.  All I'm saying is that I guessed much of the plot for The Illusionist while The Prestige kept me off guard and amazed.  Both movies are good and should be rented or bought(PRESTIGE!) ahem.  Sorry.  I just felt like comparing the two movies, but since this is a review for The Illusionist, I'll start the review.<br /><br />Most of the actors/actresses are great.  Paul Giamatti is one of my favorites and once again gives a great performance.  Edward Norton also gives a fabulous performance along with Rufus Sewell.  But then there is Biel.  Ick.  .  Ugh.  Wince.  I am of course refering to her performance.  She looks great, but she just was in over her head in this one.  I think my local movie critic(Chris Hewitt, St. Paul, Pioneer Press) put it best.  He said, "Paul Giamatti and Edward Norton deliver great performances, the only problem is that Jessica Biel occasionaly wanders in."  Thats how it is.  A+ for Paul and Norton.  A failing grade for Biel.<br /><br />The Direction was very good, I really disliked the ending which lacked magic.  It wasn't a huge surprise and they never told us how the final trick was done.  I was left going "Oh.  Thats it?"  I did like the dark tones and colors and grainyish quality.<br /><br />Overall this was a movie that had some mild disappointment and some mild surprise.  Not a great movie, but not bad by any means.  I suggest you rent this then BUY The Prestige.  Of course you might like this more, but my point is at least see both of this films.  Because both will have you believe in magic......</p></body></html>

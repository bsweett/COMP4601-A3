<meta name="summary" content="The Devil's Rejects gets a big yawn....nothing special here"></head><body><p>Rob Zombie's sequel The Devil's Rejects to the 2003 movie House Of 1000 Corpses is slightly better but it's really a borefest if you ask me. A real yawner of a movie. The acting varies in this movie but the real treat is seeing William Forsythe (The Rock, The Substitute) as Wydell. Forsythe digs deep down in his role and makes it the memorable thing in this whole entire movie. The Firefly gang are on the loose from their slaughter farmhouse and Forsythe is on their tail because they kidnapped and killed his cop friend. Forsythe wants to burn them down to the ground, give them a taste of their own medicine. The Firefly gang consists of Otis, played by Bill Moseley and Rob Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie and along for the ride is that clown from the first one Captain Spalding, played by Sid Haig. When the gruesome stuff kicks in it gets kinda mundane and it's like, ok, whatever. Also starring in this movie is Dave Sheridan (Bubble Boy), Geoffrey Lewis (Salem's Lot, The Way Of The Gun), Danny Trejo (From Dusk Till Dawn, Spy Kids), Diamond Dallas Page (Ready To Rumble), Ginger Lynn and Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes 1 and 2). One other thing would be the part where the movie critic guy comes in looking like a Gene Shalit wannabe talking about The Marx Brothers. Nothing special here....</p></body></html>

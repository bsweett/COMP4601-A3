<meta name="summary" content="A great mix of Vampires and an ABC after school special...GREAT FILM"></head><body><p>From the minute we see a "12" year old girl as a vampire who connects with a 12 yr; old boy (who is starting to get those urges ) and has a kind of romance I knew I was in for something different. This film was GREAT ! I am someone who does not mind watching either the English or original language for most foreign films. I went for English language and really had no problem with it. The story itself tells more than what an actors lines are. Look at the actors faces, look at the scenery. I could watch it with no language and still enjoy it. A nice timid pace where I did not even want the movie to end. This is not your typical guy in a cape with fangs vampire film, this is something quite different. I bought this on a recommendation actually without seeing it the theaters and was supremely surprised of just how good the story and movie were.<br />Not to give too much away but there was some gore but nothing stomach churning (at least to me) and the film touches upon a loner who is being bullied by other kids in school. What this has to do with vampires is something you will have to see for yourself.<br />I did not watch the subtitles as I just went to the English language which I usually do just to see the movie. I do watch foreign films in original language as well...usually the 2nd time around just to see/hear the differences. I am not too terribly picky. Now I did read about the subs for the DVD release being sub-par because Magnolia did not buy the original subtitle translations or something like that..okay, but is that a cause for a one star * rating ? I rate movies on the movies not so much on what a DVD brings. It is good to tell readers what the DVD is but the rating comes off as don't see it and I am here to say that you should see this movie anyway you can. Watch it anyway you like, the DVD to me is worth getting because it is that good. So while there are * star releases for the movie, that is for the DVD release...Im giving this **** stars, because the movie is outstanding irregardless of what the DVD brings to the table.<br />This is a cross between a horror movie and one of those old after school specials that used to air on ABC :)<br />BLOODY GOOD MOVIE !!! :-)</p></body></html>

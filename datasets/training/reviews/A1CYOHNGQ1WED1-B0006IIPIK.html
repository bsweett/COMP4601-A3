The story itself harkens back to the days of the pulp science fiction novels and the old movie serials where the plots got more outlandish as the story went along. With all of this I was anxious to see the movie, but it ultimately disappoints. Some of the scenes are poorly set-up and the dialog is very bad at times. Gwyneth Paltrow is terrible as the female lead. This has more to do with the material than her abilities, but it's bad nonetheless. I found her character to be shrill and irritating and couldn't wait for her to be off the screen during her scenes. More time needed to be spent on the story and especially the interactions between characters. Special effects this good are one thing, but they can't make up for a script that is lacking.</p></body></html>

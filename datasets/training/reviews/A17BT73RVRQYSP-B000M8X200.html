<meta name="summary" content="Underrated performances and fine additions."></head><body><p>This movies is one of the best movies never appreciated.  Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman are great.  Marlon Brando is, well Brando (and even more Brandoish with the added scenes.)  The special effects are of its time and might be rejected by us.  The added &quot;gauntlet&quot; scenes are worth the new purchase and only add to a movie with great performances and fine writing.  Buy it.</p></body></html>

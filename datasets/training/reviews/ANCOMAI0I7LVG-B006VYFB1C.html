I find them boring and pointless and lacking all excitement that so many heap upon them.  But, I love movies, and I love the Oscars, and when a film (and especially a performance) is talked up as Oscar potential then I feel the necessity to indulge, to take a bite, to `see for myself'.<br /><br />That is basically how `Moneyball' and I met.<br /><br />On paper, this sounds awful.  The trailers looked simple and boring and kind of dumb.  I remember making that comment on an Oscar forum, because there was just no way that this movie was going to be remotely interesting.  Then the reviews started pouring in and the praise started to mount and Pitt got his career best mentions and I sat back in bewilderment because all of this praise meant that I really needed to see this movie.  My best friend was happy, because he's always pestering me about accompanying him to sports related events (yeah, better luck next time) and so we went to the movies and I fully expected to hate this and wound up being completely absorbed in every frame.<br /><br />I have decided that if there is ever to be a movie made about my life, I want Aaron Sorkin to write the screenplay.  Seriously, between this and last year's epic `The Social Network', he is the master of spinning such detailed and rapturous webs out of seemingly mundane situations (baseball and facebook...seriously?).<br /><br />`Moneyball' tells the story of Oakland A's manager, Billy Beane' and his determination to make the A's a winning team.  The terms refers to the fact that wealthier teams get an unfair advantage in creating winning teams because they can outbid and thus buy better players.  Oakland was not a wealthy team, and yet by hiring a numbers man with a big idea (that no one believed in), Beane was able to turn things around and start something big for himself and his team.  Pitt is wonderful here, fleshing out a man who is very lived in and weathered.  He understands Beane and helps the audience to relate to him.  But, as great as Pitt (and the rest of the cast) is, this film really lives and breathes at the hands of the men behind the camera.  Sorkin and Zaillian build a marvelous script here, and Bennett Miller (should have won that Oscar back in 05) has such depth within his directorial work here that he illuminates every frame and draws you in.<br /><br />So, coming from a guy who wrote this off because of a genre, watch this...it truly is one of the best films of the year!</p></body></html>

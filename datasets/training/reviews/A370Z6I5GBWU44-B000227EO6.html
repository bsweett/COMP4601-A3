<meta name="summary" content="Good movie, though first was better"></head><body><p>Part of the reason why i didn't like this movie was Bill's boring monologue at the end, but I did like very much the part with Pai Mei, it explained a lot about how she learned her assassin skills. I'm not sure how to feel about what she did to Bill, but this is overall a good movie when watched with Vol. 1.</p></body></html>

Laurie is her old quivering, yet resourceful self. Michael is the unstoppable dreadnaut of death. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is still raving about Michael and stalking the evil stalker. The hospital setting is cool and adds to the claustrophobic feel of the movie. I love Laurie and Michael's "relationship". She's the magnet and he's the murderous iron shaving. They are drawn together by forces beyond them both, as the perfect killer / victim. I recommend Halloween 2, especially for it's excellent chase sequence between Laurie and Michael. Watch H2 as a double feature w/ the original...</p></body></html>

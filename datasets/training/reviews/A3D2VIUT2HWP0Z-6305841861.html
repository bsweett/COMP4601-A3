<meta name="summary" content="Fun, Insane, and Totally Sam Raimi"></head><body><p>COMMENTS  ABOUT THE  SPECIAL "BOOK OF THE DEAD"  EDITION:<br />Jan 2006.<br />As far as I am aware, there are at least 3 versions of the DVD for EVIL  DEAD 2.Apart from the Very Cool Book look for the special  edition I bought, I have the VHS  tape of the film with the "Skull"  face on it.<br />The most amazing plus of this  DVD  is the 5.1 audio, which makes use of all 5 channels  as well as the Sub-Woofer. Up loud, this film is potentially very scarey, and whilst I had obviously noticed the comedic  elements, I had never considered that the comedy might be the raison detre of the film; overall, I still think that the Horror-Comedy tag is correct, since most good Horror films need to be paced, otherwise the film just fails to scare.<br />The commentary is very revealing. Whilst I have continually enjoyed multiple viewings, I had never noticed the sneak references to other horror icons that the commentary refers  to in the special  feature.<br />Whilst the Special "Book" edition I am referring to in this review is about the unrated  edition, it appears some edited editions, may skip certain items ( like the British Edition).<br />The Commentary is brilliant, and reveals a great deal, and shows just how much fun the group had in creating this work. I can but wonder if Ted Raimi is perpetually thin thanks to this film, or in spite of it :-).<br />However you see this film, its a great work, and shows plenty of Sam Raimi's style, and Bruce's agility.<br />ENJOY.<br />********************<br /><br />After watching the film again for the umpteenth time, and hearing the commentary, as well as seeing the "Making of..."  feature, it is just proof positive that a film by Sam Raimi is great despite faults.<br />It seems like Sam can run on the sniff of on oily rag, as far as motivation goes, and wow how that takes him a LONG  way.<br />After doing so much with so little, it is not a surprise that with a larger budget, Raimi can do wonders.<br />Anyways, check out the making of feature, as well as the commentary... the extras make this a gem on DVD.<br />This film is great on VHS, but wow is it an awesome gem in this special  edition package.</p></body></html>

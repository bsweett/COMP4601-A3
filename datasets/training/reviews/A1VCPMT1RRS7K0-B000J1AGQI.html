This is one of those films that really take you in - and when it's over, you snap out of it and realize where you've been for the past hour and a half.  Wow!<br /><br />The acting, the story and the battles are all so stirring.  Mel Gibson plays this weighty role wonderfully.  Supporting roles by Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot and Chris Klein also help to express the amazing courage these soldiers possessed.  Very moving.<br /><br />Making a movie about such important and sensitive subject matter must be unbelievably daunting.  This movie both entertained me and disturbed me more than any war-themed movie I'd ever seen.  That is precisely why I know it was done successfully.  This film will take you as close as most of us will ever get to war, thank God.</p></body></html>

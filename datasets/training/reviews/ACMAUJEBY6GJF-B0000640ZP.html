Seriously - I thought The Ring was perhaps creepier, but the story and the acting and, not to mention, the plot is not to be compared to The Others. It is inspired by The Sixth Sence, no doubt there, but these movies are just as good, and expect for their surprise-endings there are few other similarities - Nicole Kidman must be one of the best actresses in the world.</p></body></html>

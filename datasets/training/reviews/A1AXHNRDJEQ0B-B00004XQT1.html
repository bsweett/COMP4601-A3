<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie"></head><body><p>While I never read the book the movie is based on, I've repeatedly heard the book's hard core fans declare the movie 'not violent enough'. The movie itself shows less graphic violence than 'Fight Club', and I would say the movie's rating has a lot more to do with the sex scenes than the violence.<p>The movie itself is a combination of a few genres. On one hand, there are many elements of a 'slasher flick'- serial killer, bloody killings, etc. There arew also elements of a black comedy, and a 'psychological' element - we do get into Patrick Bateman's psyche, especially towards the end of the movie.<p>But even with all these elements, I felt that most of all, this was a period piece - about the &uacute;pper class Manhatten social group, where getting a good table at the 'best'restaurant becomes an almost life or death issue, and surface and first impressions meant everything. Success was decided based on a person's platinum credit card, his business card, the blondness (and dumness) of his girlfriend, but most of all - on his ability to get a 'res'at the best restaurants.<p>There were very few special features on this DVD, mostly the standard (cast & crew, trailer, behind the scenes featurette, etc.). The interview with Christian Bale was enlightning, but is no substitute for a commentary.</p></body></html>

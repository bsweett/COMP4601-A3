<meta name="summary" content="Shameful...I ALMOST purchased this..."></head><body><p>I was just in the process of purchasing this when I was arrested by the appearance of 2 stars.<br /><br />Why 2 stars?  We're finally getting what we wanted by having both versions of the film released right?<br /><br />WRONG!!  Non-anamorphic transfer + Dolby Digital 2.0 = Maximum Profit / Minimal Input.<br /><br />Ha ha...nice try.  I will not purchase this nor be suckered by the "Limited Release" tag line.<br /><br />Maybe they'll beef the original version when HD comes out.  Sure, they'll claim over and over again that they have "no plans", but didn't we all buy that line when Lucas stated he had no intention of releasing the original trilogy?<br /><br />Yeah, ok, whatever.  I'll stick with the shoddy special edition on DVD - you know, the one where Vader's saber is pink in "Return of the Jedi" and where Luke's saber is green on the Millenium Falcon in "A New Hope."  I need to have corrective vision if THAT version is considered restored - so much for the "THX" logo, huh?</p></body></html>

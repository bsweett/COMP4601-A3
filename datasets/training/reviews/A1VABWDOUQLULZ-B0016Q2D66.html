I had no idea what the film was about, so nothing was given away.  I went into it fairly open.  From the opening scene there was something disjointed about the film's flow that I just couldn't get around.  I thought perhaps I just didn't relate to the 1950s dynamic, that perhaps one of the Wheeler couple had some sort of mental imperative that skewed the story for the audience, or some other similar great reveal lurked right around the corner.  But nothing ever jumped out to save this film.  It looked spectacular, the story was interesting though painfully slow moving throughout, the acting was top-notch.  In the end what struck me most was that despite how many wonderful elements made up this film, they did not act in unison.  While Winslet, DiCaprio and their supporting cast were fantastic, they all felt like they were each acting in their own film.  There was no synergy.  That was, in essence, the point of the film, but the feeling that even the cast was fragmented did not seal the story.  In the end it gives good insight into the insidious nature of depression and how despite the way things may appear on the outside, everything has shadows.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The deviations from the book ticked me off a little this time."></head><body><p>The movie was decent. The creatures were very good. The scenery was good. For the most part, the deviations from the plot of the book were understandable. However, the whole Aslan revealing himself to the children, first to Lucy, then to Edward, then Susan and Peter was really key to the whole plot and lessons to be learned from the story. Lewis was trying to tell a good story, but he was passing on spiritual truths of Christianity as well. Edward, gets a "Well Done" from Aslan in the book because he trusted Lucy this time. The movie missed this "walk of faith" analogy almost completely. Although it did have Edward redeeming himself so to speak in a scene that isn't in the book.<br /><br />Oh well, the movie kept a lot of the good scenes of the books. I enjoyed it and I'll have to watch it again. Some of the changes were good. Even though PC was mainly about the war to free Narnia, I think they played up the battle too much. It will be interesting to see how they handle "The Horse and His Boy", which only has one battle and "Dawntreader" that has no battles.<br /><br />One other thing that ticked me off, Aslan sends Peter and Susan back, if memory serves, and tells them that they must learn to seek him there (back in England). The movie skips that part, which I thought was a key lesson from the book.<br /><br />The movie introduced a romance between Caspian and Susan. I think that was cool.<br /><br />In summary, the movie was good, but it could have been so much better. It's a children book and it feels like they are ramping up the action for adults. However, it's the adults that can take the subtlety. By the way, my friend from England thought the movie was better than the Lion, the Witch and Wardrobe.</p></body></html>

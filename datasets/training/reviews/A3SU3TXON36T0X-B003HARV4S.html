<meta name="summary" content="The Illusionist:  A Classic Love Story."></head><body><p>_The Illusionist_ is an excellent and entertaining film with a unique story detailing the efforts of a young magician to win the love of a woman.  The story is set in 1900s Vienna, and the costumes and scenery are certainly appropriate for that time period.  The story traces the life of a young magician (who was first taught by a wandering magician he came in contact with) as he meets with a young Duchess and tries to win her love.  However, the two are forced to separate because the young man is a peasant and the Duchess is royalty and such an accommodation is inconceivable to the people of the time.  After their forced separation the young magician travels to the Orient where he learns the secrets of the "dark arts".  It is only then that he returns to Vienna as the illusionist and stage magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton).  The magic tricks of Eisenheim are particularly complex, and seeing as how they have no apparent and conceivable manner in which they could be accomplished many attribute them to the supernatural.  It is while performing on stage however that Eisenheim meets with the Duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel) again in a daring encounter with death that invokes the immortality of the soul.  As it turns out however, Duchess Sophie is to be wed to Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), who not only challenges the tricks of the magician but also is notoriously ruthless and cruel (and even rumored to have beaten his previous mistress and possibly killed her).  The story involves a profound encounter with death and raises the question of the nature of the soul.  Indeed, the police Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) is also to enter this story as the plot unravels.  Ultimately a conflict ensues between the Crown Prince and the magician that must be settled in a very disturbing manner.  Further, the emerging spiritualist movement plays some role in this story as the magician invokes the spirits of the dead.  Spiritualism (which was often linked to socialism and various reform movements) is invoked by the people as a means to achieve a "spiritual republic".  Such subversive activities are of course frowned upon by the powers that be.  The movie ultimately raises the question of the existence of the supernatural and the survival of the soul after death.  To see how this is resolved within the movie, you must watch it.  However, as a story the movie is a classic tale of love that knows no bounds (neither the separation in social class nor the separation of the grave can drive the lovers apart).  I found this movie to be excellently done.  The story is interesting, the magic tricks are impressive, the characters were well played, and the setting was as I would expect the turn-of-the-century in Vienna.  As a love story this movie is a classic and is sure to provide a night's worth of entertainment.</p></body></html>

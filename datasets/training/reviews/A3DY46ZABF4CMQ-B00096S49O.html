<meta name="summary" content="...the best romantic comedy of the year!"></head><body><p>From the opening scene in Hitch of Overbrook Entertainment's logo of a record playing with the song Wonderful World (Don't Know Much) by Sam Cooke in the background, and Will Smith narrating what women think of when they wake up in the morning in the opening credits, you know you're in for a really good movie.<br /><br />Hitch is a romantic comedy directed by Andy Tennant (Sweet Home Alabama) and starring Will Smith (Bad Boys), Eva Mendes (Out Of Time), and comedian Kevin James.<br /><br />Smith plays Alex Hitchens (a.k.a. Hitch), a love doctor, who helps desperate single men make the right moves and get the women of their dreams. Things start to change for Hitch when he hooks up Albert, played hilariously by Kevin James in his first major motion picture starring role, with the most famous gorgeous woman in New York, Allegra Cole, played by the pretty Amber Valletta, whom he happens to be one of the accountants for. On the other hand, Hitch begins falling for Sara, a columnist for a major New York newspaper, who is following up on a story on Allegra Cole and her unknown hubby, Albert, and one woman who thinks the love doctor is nothing but a manipulative man who tricks women but doesn't know who he is in person. I think you get the picture as to where the movie goes next.<br /><br />Will Smith is perfect for the role of Hitch, he's charming and has one heck of a sense of humor. Kevin James steals the show with his outwardly funny antics. Those are only two of the reasons why Hitch works.<br /><br />The movie is simply the best romantic comedy of the year!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A-</p></body></html>

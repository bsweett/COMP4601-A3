<meta name="summary" content="Bogart's Best and one of the best films ever!"></head><body><p>Wow, where to start. Quite simply, this has to be one of the greatest movies ever made. Now realize that this is coming from me, a 16-year-old! I don't consider myself anything of a film expert, but I know a good film when I see one. It's hard to imagine that the part of Rick was originally scripted for Ronald Reagan, but Bogart's performance is flawless, as is Bergman's. I also find it somewhat ironic that it spawned a catch phrase that was never spoken verbatum in the film, but aside from that, wow. A lot of people may find the storyline somewhat dry by today's standards, but I love it. All of the actors have marvelous voices. Casablanca only gets better 'As Time Goes By' (neat little reference, eh?), and I highly recommend it to anyone with a pulse and a soul. If you must see one more movie before you die, it doesn't get any better than Casablanca.<br /><br />Also, Bogart fans should check out "The Maltese Falcon" and "The Enforcer".</p></body></html>

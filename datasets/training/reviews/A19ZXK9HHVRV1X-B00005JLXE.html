<meta name="summary" content="so-so comic book film"></head><body><p>**1/2 Matt Murdock is a mild-mannered, pro bono attorney by day and a high-flying, crime-fighting superhero by night.  The one thing that separates this costumed do-gooder (who goes by the name Daredevil) from his comic book brethren like Superman and Spiderman is that Murdock/Daredevil happens to be blind.  The same accident involving radioactive chemicals that, as a boy, deprived Matt of his eyesight also had the bizarre effect of heightening and enhancing his other senses, most notably hearing and touch, to an astonishing degree (it should be pointed out that little is done in the story with taste and smell).  The accident also appears, inexplicably, to have given him the power to defy the laws of physics and gravity.  Like any superhero worthy of the title, he uses these preternatural skills to right wrongs and bring justice to the imperiled and helpless citizenry living in the urban jungles of New York City.  <p>The hero's handicap seems to be about the only element, in fact, that distinguishes the movie "Daredevil" from the earlier films based on those other characters.  As conceived by writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, the tone of this film is a few shades darker than the one in "Spiderman" and a few shades lighter than the one in "Batman" and "Darkman."  Since there is nothing particularly fresh or groundbreaking offered in this film, one begins to wonder why Hollywood feels such a compelling need to drive this particular genre into the already over-saturated ground (even adolescents, the target audience for this type of film, seem to be tiring of all these offerings lately).  "Daredevil" provides all the requisite scenes of its superhero soaring through the air, jumping from building to building, and karate-chopping his way to victory over a plethora of bad-guy enemies.  But it's all starting to feel a bit old hat by this time, so much so that, even in the moments when "Daredevil" is good, the film doesn't feel innovative and fresh enough for us to really commit to it.  Ben Affleck, with his earnest and stolid seriousness, does manage to bring a certain gravity to the main character - and his relationship with Elektra (Jennifer Garner), a young woman with some "superhero" moves of her own, is genuinely charming and touching at times.  There is a lovely scene in which Matt envisions Elektra's beauty by hearing the raindrops falling on her face.  It is in rare moments such as this that "Daredevil" rises above the conventions of its genre, but such moments are very few and far between indeed.  Most of the running time seems to be spent on characters performing acrobatic kickboxing moves on tops of skyscrapers (all of which are decked out with statuary in places where nobody would ever be likely to see it).  Colin Farrell invests the implement-wielding villain, Bullseye, with an air of sly menace that makes him a worthy foil to the lovestruck boy wonder of the piece.  I must say, in way of a caveat, that some of the violence in the film is uglier and more mean-spirited in nature than is, perhaps, justified by the material. <p>"Daredevil" tries for a little thematic richness by dramatizing the internal conflict being waged inside Matt's psyche between the need to let the legal system runs its course and his own desire to achieve a little vigilante-type justice for the victims when the court system itself fails.  But that theme is never dealt with at any great level of depth.  The art direction, action sequences and special effects are generally impressive, but even they contribute to the generalized feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu that hangs over the work.  Maybe it's finally time to outgrow our obsession with superheroes who come out of nowhere to fight our battles for us - and time to stop always thinking of ourselves as some sort of defeated underdog in need of protection.  There are certainly enough life-sized heroes living and working in our own communities and neighborhoods to serve as our inspiration.<p>Movies like "Daredevil" may, finally, have run their course.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great movie, not Cruise's show"></head><body><p>This was a really good movie and it was all thanks to Jamie Foxx, he stole this show 100% and left Tom Cruise looking confused and gray haired in the background. Highly recommended, fresh screenplay, stylish direction and a solid even pacing make this one a keeper.</p></body></html>

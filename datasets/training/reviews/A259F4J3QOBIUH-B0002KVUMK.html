<meta name="summary" content="CGI a little over the top, but I've watched it a few times.  I dig it."></head><body><p>I have noted some bad reviews, and few stars but I really liked this film and I am keeping mine.  When this first came out, I was very impressed, but even then I thought that some of the CGI was over the top.  If you suspend disbelief (and / or have a margarita), the movie is very visually appealing.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale, alone, gives the movie a high rating, IMHO.  There are some aspects of the film which are hokey, silly, or overdone, but overall I liked the movie enough to watch it a few times.<br /><br />I recommend watching <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGJ80S">Bram Stoker's Dracula (Collector's Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001WTUH6">Underworld (Unrated Extended Cut)</a>, then watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KVUKM">Van Helsing (Widescreen Edition)</a>.</p></body></html>

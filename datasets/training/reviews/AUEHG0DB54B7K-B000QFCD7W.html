The story is a simple one: four middle-aged men (Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy), living in Cincinnati, are feeling that life is passing them by.  The interest that joins them together are motorcycles and they were playfully dubbed "The Wild Hogs" complete with a leather jacket back patch that is designed by Tim Allen's wife.  However, the four buddies may look like bikers their only ride takes them around town to a local bar - until John Travolta brings up a road trip.  What follows is a comic adventure that takes the guys to California as they pretend to be bikers.<br /><br />Along the way the guys run into a motorcycle gang (called the Del Fuegos - which turns out to be a nice play on words) led by Jack (nicely played by Ray Liotta), who seems more outraged that the Wild Hogs dare to call themselves a motorcycle gang.  Jack's gang is the terror of the area and the local police are not match for them, and they set out to have vengeance on the Hogs.  In the final showdown between the gangs, the Hogs have to prove themselves (which, of course they do) and inspire the locals of Madrid, New Mexico to defy Jack and his gang.<br /><br />The film is good fun and it is clear that everyone enjoyed making the movie.  There is a brief appearance of Peter Fonda - his Easy Rider character now grandfatherly - that was a most welcome addition to the cast; it was also good to see Marisa Tomei as the owner of a diner. The message of Wild Hogs is; simply, don't wait to do the things you want to do - make the time.  Wild Hogs was the best time my wife and I have had at the movies in a long time.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

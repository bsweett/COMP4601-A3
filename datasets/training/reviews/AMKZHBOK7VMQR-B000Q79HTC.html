<meta name="summary" content="Solid Thriller"></head><body><p>This film has much to recommend it. The plot is interesting and tense. The acting particularly by Matt Damon is very strong. The locations in Europe are extremely intriguing. The film has an intensity about it that it is able to sustain all the way through with very few slow moments. For those who enjoy James Bond type action flicks this is a can't miss selection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Vehicle for Will Smith's Towering Talent"></head><body><p>Will Smith certainly gets the interesting science fiction action pictures, doesn't he? This is one of the best he's done. The closing credits say it was "suggested by" Asimov's story. But those of us who remember the story will remember that it was a short story, one of several in a book by the same name, but not anything long enough to be a feature-length movie out of it. Still, the necessary elements are there, and what's been made of them would make old Isaac proud.<br /><br />Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a Chicago cop of the not-too-distant future, when robots are becoming very common in society, and everyone knows the three laws of robotics:<br /><br />1. A robot cannot harm a human, or through inaction allow a human to come to harm.<br />2. A robot must obey the orders of a human unless they conflict with Rule One.<br />3. A robot must protect its own existence unless it conflicts with Rule One or Two.<br /><br />Asimov has promulgated these three laws for long enough that most science fiction fans are familiar with them. We are also familiar with stories written about attempts to circumvent this hard-wired programming. So when a famous robotic designer is found fallen out of his office window onto the marble atrium below, everyone assumes it was suicide, because no one was in the office with him at the time. But Spooner is suspicious of robots (we find out why eventually), and figures the scientist was murdered, possibly by a robot. Sure enough, an apparently out of control robot is discovered in his office, and Spooner figures it for the killer. But of course everyone, including Dr. Susan Calvin, robot psychologist, tells him that's just not possible.<br /><br />Now, this really is a mystery, and the clues lead everywhere and nowhere, so I don't want to ruin it for you. Let's just say that almost no one in this film is what they seem to be at first, except perhaps Spooner's granny. And don't be too sure about her, either.<br /><br />It's a real hardware movie, with lots of fast action and things going smash, which should satisfy the younger crowd. But it's also a make-you-think sort of plot at several levels, and that's the kind I especially enjoy. Not to mention seeing Smith bare-chested. The man is buffed!</p></body></html>

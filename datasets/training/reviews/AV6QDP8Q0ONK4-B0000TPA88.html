<meta name="summary" content="CALL ME ISHMAEL"></head><body><p>This is a superhero movie that takes place in 1899 utilizing numerous fictional characters from that era, some more obscure than others. The main character, Allan Quatermain, played by Sean Connery, would become the model for Indiana Jones. The movie takes some liberties with the characters. For instance Mr. Hyde has been transformed into "The Hulk." There is a list of fine actors which in itself makes the movie a worth while view. Even the minor characters are names from old novels.<br /><br />The fighting and action lack much of that special CG effect of bullet dodging and gravity defying martial art moves.<br /><br />The movie is fairly plain and straight forward with a twist, but not complex . Certainly a worth while view if you either like Marvel/DC comic heroes or are just a fan of 19th century literature.<br /><br />No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Lots of killing, minimum blood/gore. Some sexual innuendos in the dialouge. MAKES FOR AN EXCELLENT FAMILY RENTAL if you don't mind a little violence/killing.</p></body></html>

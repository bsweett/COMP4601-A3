It's hilarious. :-D<br />A parody of many holiday specials, including the animated 'Rudolph', this is real fun for the whole family.  Ferrell never breaks character, and what a character. Bob Newhart as the head elf is inspired.<br />Laughs all the way through and a Christmas message too.<br /><br />ENJOY! :-D</p></body></html>

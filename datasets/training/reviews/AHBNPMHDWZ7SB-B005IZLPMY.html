<meta name="summary" content="The Avengers Saga Enters the Golden Age"></head><body><p>After years of awaiting a movie worth this historically rich character's name, I'm happy to announce that a good Captain America film finally here. I was quite blown away by how much I enjoyed it. My fear of the worst kept my expectations in check as I waited for The First Avenger to hit theaters. For a while, I expected it to be mediocre to moderately good, but I retained a cautious optimism. I didn't have enough faith in it to hype the movie up to friends and family, but I prayed it would be as good as the previous films in the Avengers Saga. Being a huge Marvel fan, I was obliged to see it no matter how good or bad critics said it was. Surprisingly, it turned out to be just what Joe Johnston's credentials promised. It was a good old fashioned throwback action adventure flick that's fun (for the family, despite a few shockingly violent moments), humorous, and surprisingly, emotionally resonant. I thought it was a notch or two above Thor, albeit I wouldn't recommend one over the other. Johnston's last few films (The Wolfman, Jurassic Park III and Hidalgo -- two of which I actually enjoyed) didn't have great receptions, so it was understandable for most to be weary of him directing, but I think he did a damn good job with material that had the potential to be very silly. The character, Captain America, is one of those characters that everyone knows of, but not many people care about. He probably comes across as a boring character, due to his overtly American themes, simplistic superpowers, and his shield.<br /><br />In fact, the film could have easily been quite boring, or laughably silly, but I'm pleased to say that this movie is none of the above, and neither are most of Cap's latest publishings, to be honest. This is a classic case of not judging a book by its cover. Granted, there are inherently cheesy moments throughout the film, but what do you expect from an apparent propaganda piece about an unlikely soldier with an American flag costume and a big shield, who is battling an evil Nazi with red skin that is bent on world domination? I actually loved the cheese factor. It went quite well with the 40's WWII atmosphere, and the film as a whole. Like I mentioned before, this film was a throwback to the old fashioned action adventure movies like Indiana Jones and The Rocketeer (another Johnston film). There's an automatic cheese factor that goes with the territory. Early flags were raised by internet dwellers about Chris Evans not being right for the leading role. I never bought into those complaints. I mean, have you guys seen him? Blonde hair, blue eyes, quirky innocence, toned body, and actual acting abilities (if you've seen him in anything besides Fantastic Four -- which he was actually one of the best aspects of). What the hell else did we need for him to be right for the role? I don't know, but I had faith in him and he delivered. Some people have said that he was bland and just a good guy with no internal conflict, and for the most part, I agree. That's who he is supposed to be though. His character was developed as he grew up, due to him being physically inane. That was the very reason why Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) recruited him.<br /><br />I loved Evans as Steve Rogers, and even more as Cap. He just flat out kicked ass, in my opinion. He went against what we've become accustomed to in superhero movies, and it worked well. Spoilers: When Cap threw a knife into a Hydra agents back, then threw two other Hydra agents right out of a plane, I knew his portrayal would be a legend for years to come. I really was not expecting that kind of brutality in a cartoonish comic book movie where us older fans have come to expect major toning down for young children. I mean, he is a soldier, and this is a war, but you get my point. It would be asinine for him to go through all of that trouble trying to enlist and getting turned down, only to go overseas and just knock his enemies out. Killing is what war is about, so hats off to Johnston and his writers, as well as Marvel Studios and Paramount for having the testicular fortitude to let that happen in The First Avenger. Another surprisingly violent moment was when the older woman in the hidden base got shot and we actually saw the impact. Well, she did have a machine gun, but even so, I applaud them again for letting that happen in a family blockbuster. It added to the seriousness of the situation, and left more of an impact. The audience should take from that, that the Nazi spy who gunned down the older women needed to be taken down as soon as possible. While I did appreciate the mature sparks of violence, there were also other noticeable tone downs that conflicted with them.<br /><br />Now I'll admit that this is just me nitpicking, but that's what reviews are for, right? Similar to the Decepticon canons in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, I have to say that I was distracted by the way that Hydra's advanced weapons disintegrated their victims, pretty much reducing them to dust, instead of actually showing the devastation of the weapons like they did with regular guns. I'm not saying that it was necessary to show blood splatter when the cosmic blasts impacted. I understand the ratings system, but what they chose to do was pushing it, even for science fiction. Speaking of those weapons, some have argued that they seemed more appropriate for a film set in the future, more so than one set in the 1940's. That is an understandable quibble, but that was the point. The cosmic cube allowed Hydra to develop weaponry that was far beyond anything from the time period. That was why Red Skull went through such lengths to attain the cube, and develop the Hydra tech with it. Speaking of Red Skull, I have to say I loved him in this movie. Perhaps he was not as menacing as he could have been, but, I'll be damned if he wasn't one of the coolest villains I've seen in a while. Hugo Weaving should just play villains in everything for the rest of his career. He does it too well. After seeing his performance, I cannot think of another actor who I would have chosen over him. I'm glad to have him immortalized in the Marvel Universe now, and I hope he returns for the sequel. I'm sure he will because he's obviously not dead, only teleported to another dimension or plane. Actually, I think the whole cast was great.<br /><br />Haley Atwell was probably the best main love interest of all the Avengers Saga films, which is surprising given she's the least recognizable of all of the actresses who played them. If I were to rank them, I'd do it as follows: Haley Atwell, Gwyneth Paltrow, Natalie Portman, and lastly, Liv Tyler. As for Atwell's character, Peggy Carter, I loved how they chose to keep her sexiness hidden until she appeared in that stunning red dress. Her character was introduced as a tough one, but she showed compassion towards Steve. She was a very well developed character, and I'll be sorely disappointed if this is the last we see of her. Spoilers: The moment she and Steve shared before he crashed into the ice was moving, and as I was feeling for them, I was quite surprised that this film managed elicit such an emotional response from me. The same film that I feared would be drowned in mediocrity. They did such a fantastic job at developing thirt relationship. Sadly, I'm pretty sure this is her only outing. There were quite a few moments when I sincerely cared for the fate of the characters. Not only Steve and Peggy, but Bucky (Sebastian Stan) as well. He has one of the saddest, and most surprising moments in the film. Even as a fan of the comics, who knew what would happen to Bucky, as well as who he later becomes, I have to admit that moment got me. I mentioned Stanley Tucci briefly before, but I didn't say that I enjoyed his performance as the doctor responsible for Steve's transformation. I thought Tucci did a pretty good job with the minimal screentime he had.<br /><br />What more can one say about Tommy Lee Jones that hasn't been said before? He was primarily comic relief, and he was quite funny. Dominic Cooper (The Devil's Double, An Education) was an appropriate choice as Howard Stark. He was a nice counterpart to Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. I was pleased with the Howling Commandos as well. Neal McDonough was great as Dum Dum Doogan. His character wasn't as fleshed out as I would have liked, considering the role he played in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s development, but he was fine nonetheless. Now all of this praise is not to say that I don't think the film is flawed. It's far from perfect, and many people will most likely have issues with the overall cheesiness of the plot and stereotypical portrayals of the characters, but I enjoyed it very much. It was a great tie-in to the Avengers Saga, but nothing took precedence over Cap's origin story. This is first, and foremost, a Captain America film.The build up for The Avengers has been an exciting one to experience. Each link in the chain is solid, with some obviously being stronger than others. I think Captain America: The First Avenger falls in at second best in the series, after the first Iron Man. As for the transfer, the picture quality is as good as one would expect a modern release to look. Detail is strong and fairly crisp, although some may confuse the Director and Cinematographer's choice of dim lighting and color timing as soft. The sound is pretty much flawless. As far as the extras go, they leave a lot to be desired. The best of the bunch is without a doubt, the commentary. The featurettes, as well as the Marvel One-Shot, are short, but sweet. All in all, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />Note: I own the Best Buy exclusive version, but the only difference is the cardboard slipcover.</p></body></html>

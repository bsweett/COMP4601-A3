<meta name="summary" content="Well the gore is great. 3.5 Stars"></head><body><p>The gore is all this film has going for it. Okay well the crash scene is very unsettling, because it's so real looking, and pile ups happen everyday, but then it goes downhill from there. The hilarious and mean spirited ending is also a plus. The film unfortunately packs one cliche after another. It's another slasher film, and what's funny about it, is that it is trying to scare you, and at that it fails miserably. Plot? Well if you've seen the first, this is exactly like it, except this one has more gore. If you haven't seen the first, then you have no business watching this one then. Remember sequels are just a cash in and not a movie of itself. Sorry Hollywood, visuals and gore only produce chuckles, and not screams. Mess with our mind, and don't put us to sleep. But there are far worse out there so I have to say this one isn't that bad.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Horror At Its Absolute Best""></head><body><p>I first discovered "Wrong Turn" when I was scanning through my TV late one night and saw it on a movie channel. I had never heard of it but read the info on my television guide and decided to give it a try. I am a sucker for a good scary film and I was not at all disappointed by "Wrong Turn". The film is about a bunch of young people in their early twenties whose car breaks down in the backwoods on a long deserted stretch of an abandoned road in West Virginia. What happens to them as the movie unfolds is horrific as these people come in contact with a bunch of in-breeders who feed off human beings. The scenes are excellently directed and acted, the action is bone-chilling, and the suspence of it all will leave you breathless. If your a fan of films like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Wrong Turn" will not let you down. This film, which was a huge boxoffice hit, was followed by "Wrong Turn 2" that was released directly to DVD. Also, just in time for Halloween, "Wrong Turn 3-Left For Dead" arrives in DVD stores in October, 2009. This particular DVD version of "Wrong Turn" features both the widescreen and full screen editions of the movie as well as many bonuses. There is commentary by director Rob Schmidt and its stars Desmond Harrington and Eliza Dushku, 4 featurettes are included on the making of the film, and much more.</p></body></html>

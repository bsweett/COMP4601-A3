Yes, the film wants to be about more than Robinson Crusoe, thus the emotional/relationship drama is given much more space than expected ... but that's not we went to see. Whether the symbolism of the title works on more than one level is clever, but the fact that it wasn't emphasized in the trailers seems to say that the producers knew that the moviegoing public wasn't too interested in that aspect either.<p>The first half of the movie works, and we identify with Hanks' character, and begin to ask ourselves how we would have fared, and all the comforts we take for granted ... but before we can witness more of his transformation from hapless modern man to wizened hunter-gatherer, he is rescued.<p>Then the second part of the movie begins ... but do we really care?<p>Spectacular environmental effects, and sense of isolation and aloneness ... if only there were more.</p></body></html>

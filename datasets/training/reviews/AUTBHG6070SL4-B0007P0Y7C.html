<meta name="summary" content="Passable comic adaptation"></head><body><p>It's got pretty much everything I'd want in a comic adaptation - some fair fight/action sequences, over-the-top characters and effects, and Jennifer Garner's babe appeal. It's all safe stuff. The "action violence" is quite bloodless, since vanquished bad guys vanish in a puff of smoke instead of bleeding all over the place. Garner's "Elektra" costume does good things for her figure and for 14-year-old boys, but still covers better than what you see at the beach.<br /><br />The plot moves along well. Elektra is hired to kill a man and his teen daughter. After meeting them, she decides not to finish the contract but to save them instead. Then the chase is on - and it turns out that Daddy and daughter are a bit more than Elektra signed up for. The whole assassination contract was a bit more than she signed up for, but you'll have to see that for yourself.<br /><br />The bad guys are OK, but sometimes uninspired. Typhoid, for example, has the super-power of fatally bad breath. Tattoo has (you guessed it) tattoos - but his tend to wander away. Then there's a guy whose evil super power seems to be in being big. Not super big, just big. Also, there's a lot of detail, but not all of it seems to serve the plot. The OCD thing - how does that explain anything we need to know? The flashbacks were generally good, but a few failed to move the plot forward.<br /><br />It's a good comic book movie, no matter what the critics said. If there had been fewer stray strands and bit stronger action, it might have been great. Still, it was good.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

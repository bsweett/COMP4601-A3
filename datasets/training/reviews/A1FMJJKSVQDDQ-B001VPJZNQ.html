<meta name="summary" content="Action-packed, with some good humor along the way"></head><body><p>This is one of those action films in which I can sit back and enjoy as I watch every second of it. It's good to see some spectacular action and visual hilarity without the exploration of logical positivism, Aristotelian symbolisms, etc. Philosophy and Ethics are for drama films, not action films (although Terminator: 2 did a fabulous job with questions of human nature). Like I said, the action and humor are superb. I had a heck of a good time watching The Rundown. Honorable mentions go to the actors (especially Walken) for giving this film a higher entertainment value.</p></body></html>

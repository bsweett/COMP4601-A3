<meta name="summary" content="Claustrophobia,  anyone?"></head><body><p>Here is a rather horrifying thought:  how would you like it if someone put you in a straight jacket, bound your feet, then put you in the drawer of a morgue and left you there for hours?  What's that you, you say?  You'd rather not sample that particular adventure?  Neither would I.  However, it's the basic premise of this movie.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, the movie actually turns out to be rather upbeat in spite of this fact.  Of course, it's upbeat in a rather twisted, bizarre sort of way.  It is kind of a cross between a ghost story and a time travel movie.  And, yes, the movie is as weird as that sounds, although weird doesn't make it not worth seeing.<br /><br />Of course, the biggest feature of this film is Keira Knightley.  She adds a great deal of flavor to a movie that looks for all the world like it's going to be a real downer.<br /><br />If you're into movies that are not afraid to be classified as "experimental," you may well want to check this one out. If you're not claustrophobic, you will be perfect for viewing this film!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Deliberate Attempt at Bad Drive In Movie"></head><body><p>The GRINDHOUSE experience, as portrayed in this double offering of PLANET TERROR and DEATH PROOF, stirs up more confusion than nostalgia.  The authentic clips introducing the fake Coming Attractions hits the mark perfectly!  WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE S.S. is dead on.  The echoing, minimalist voice over for the THANKSGIVING trailer is perfect.<br /><br />But the movies themselves end up being too schizo to really evoke the 1970s drive-in "grindhouse" experience.<br /><br />First of all, you have an A-list production of special effects, photography, etc....but they added scratched film effects.  Both films appear to be in the present when bell-bottom pants, big porn moustaches and horrible 70's hair would've worked better than the scratched film effect.<br /><br />And, really, most modern movies are this "bad"...or worse.  Is PLANET TERROR really that different than the monthly zombie movies we're getting all the time?  The gore and the violence are as bloody and grotesque as anything else we're getting a steady diet of.  RESIDENT EVIL, 28 DAYS LATER, "WHATEVER" OF THE DEAD, etc.  I know the rifle attached to Rose McGowan's leg is supposed to be so over-the-top that it's funny...but aren't all the other modern movies this stupid that it doesn't seem so extreme?  It really didn't seem that out of place these days.<br /><br />Still, PLANET TERROR is far more entertaining than DEATH PROOF, although the zombie thing has been (literally) done to death.  How about doing a parody of ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET THE DAWN OF THE DEAD?  Now there you'd have something that wouldn't look like everything else these days.<br /><br />(And can Quentin Tarantino look any creepier in his cameos?  His role as "The Rapist" in PLANET TERROR was mercifully brief, but he just comes off as a creepy bartender in DEATH PROOF surrounded by sideshow freaks between shots of hot chicks and their feet.)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What a load of rubbish! A disgrace to true Halloween fans!"></head><body><p>As you might have read on my other reviews, I am a Halloween fan. In truth I loved the original, the second, and H20 only (The others were not that good at all). This film however, is an overly vulgar, too over the top, too brutal, and horribly written crappy disaster. It ruins Halloween. My suggestion is that you ignore this schlock and stick with the true Halloween trilogy of 1, 2, and H20.</p></body></html>

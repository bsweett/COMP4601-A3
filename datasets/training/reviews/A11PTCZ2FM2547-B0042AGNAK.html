<meta name="summary" content="Total Nonsense But Still Fun"></head><body><p>I know; GHOST RIDER is based on a Marvel comic book series, for cryin' out loud.  I realize the story about Johnny Blaze collecting souls has a metaphysical premise to begin with, but still can't help but giggle when the Ghost Rider manifestation appears:  skull aflame, spikes on the shoulders of the leather jacket, chains afire, and a bike that goes anywhere it wants and does anything it wants.  Yep, the comic artist who spawned an apparition like this must have been sipping some pretty stout absinthe.  How else can you think up stuff like this?<br /><br />But enough with the silliness of this particular superhuman character who dares to defy Mephistopheles; GHOST RIDER (the movie) is just plain fun to watch, for a myriad of reasons.  Granted, Nicolas Cage looks more like a Johnny Blaze just joining AARP, but he still brings his own quirky humor to what could have been way too dark a role.  Buxom, voluptuous beauties like Eva Mendes make one glad to be alive; I could watch her bake cookies and still need heart medication.  Sam Elliott is one of my all-time fave actors, sporting a mumbling voice so low you swear you can feel the floor vibrate.  ("It's what's for dinner.")  And Peter Fonda is a wickedly evil Mephistopheles in such a quiet, disturbing way.  Combine all of the above with eye-popping CGI/special effects, plug in an over-the-top ending that dares to suggest a sequel (don't they all?), and GHOST RIDER may be the most fun you'll ever have with total nonsense.  Nic, your scalp's on fire.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

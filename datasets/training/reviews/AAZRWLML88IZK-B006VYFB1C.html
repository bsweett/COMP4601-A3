<meta name="summary" content="Moneyball"></head><body><p>A baseball movie that mostly eschews game sequences for scenes of guys sitting around and talking about obscure statistics -- sounds like a winner, right? Well, yes, in the case of Moneyball. Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, the general manager of the small market Oakland Athletics; his mission is to find a way to field a winning team with a fraction of the money that the Yankees and Red Sox have to snag big time players. With the help of stat geek Peter Brand, Beane acquires a ragtag group of castoffs and old timers who share a common trait: they have abilities that the entrenched scouting establishment has ignored. Based upon Michael Lewis' bestseller, Moneyball is an amazing film, and while baseball obsessives will find a couple things to quibble about -- the movie barely mentions the contributions of stars like Miguel Tejada, Tim Hudson, Barry Zito, or Eric Chavez -- this is an intelligent, witty piece of moviemaking. A new Blu-ray/DVD/UltraViolet combo pack comes with several making-of featurettes and bloopers.</p></body></html>

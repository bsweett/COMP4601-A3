In a year when most films underperformed "Wedding Crashers" far exceeded anybody's box office predictions.  Noteworthy is that it solidified Owen Wilson's standing as a leading comic force, magnified Vince Vaughn as a star to be reckoned with, and broke two of the more appealing actresses on the screen today, the fresh-faced Rachel McAdams and the saucy redhead Isla Fisher.  Bottom line is this is a funny, funny film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nice Work"></head><body><p>Very nice film and Clint Eastwood's best work.  Noteworthy performances by both Swank and Freeman earned them their most deserved Oscars; however, I'm not so sure about Best Picture.  I still think Ray should have been the winner on that.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the performances in this movie were  well done without being overdramatic.  I found the trailer trash relatives to be a bit too caricature, but the intimate "father-daughter" like moments between Swank and Eastwood were very touching without being overdone.<br /><br />Worthwhile movie and Eastwood's best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Welcome back, Superman;  3 and a half stars."></head><body><p>Continuity-wise, Superman Returns takes place 5 years after the events of Superman II (1981). Superman has just returned after years of searching deep space for remnants of his native planet Krypton. But, while he was gone, the world had shrugged and continued to spin without him. As Clark Kent, he gets his old job back as mild-mannered reporter for the Daily Planet. But things are definitely not back to normal. Lois Lane, to his dismay, has moved on. She's now the mother of a young, asthmatic boy and is engaged to Perry White's nephew Richard. She's even won the Pulitzer Prize for her article "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman" (ouch!). Lex Luthor, too, is up and about, released from prison due to a technicality: Superman didn't make his court date to testify against him. Lex's new master plan is to use Kryptonian technology to raise a land mass while simultaneously sinking much of the U.S. of A. After all, real estate is where it's at. He also has an ace up his sleeve with regards to the Big Red "S".<br /><br />So I went to see this movie in deep, hopeful anticipation. I wanted to be able to tell people that it did justice to the Christopher Reeve classics. Afterwards, I walked away somewhat with mixed feelings but, overall, leaning towards the positive. Superman Returns was certainly entertaining and filled with great f/x, but, no, I don't feel it lived up to all the hoop-la (but, then again, it would have to have been just about the perfect film to be worthy of all the monster pre-screening pub it got). While Superman Returns truly is an epic effort, it falls short of Superman I & II. Yes, it has its moments of sheer majesty and scope, but it lacks enough of those quiet, little personal touches that allow the audience to fully connect with the movie. Scenes with Lois and Clark, which, to me, were some of the hallmark moments in Superman I & II, are too few in Superman Returns. Routh should've been given more scenes as Clark Kent as he's the one that grounds Superman to reality and the one whom we usually identify with the most in the film. Also, one of the challenges in doing a Superman flick is ensuring that the Man of Steel has a worthy adversary. This time out, Lex Luthor proves to be a subpar opponent. And how many times can one introduce kryptonite as a weapon?<br /><br />Brandon Routh does a very good job. Yes, it helps that there's a vague resemblance between him and Christopher Reeve. And, yes, Routh channels Reeve in much the same way Ewan McGregor channels Alec Guinness in Star Wars. Routh ably captures Clark Kent's personal quirks and mannerisms, and even sounds eerily like Reeve at times. But Brandon Routh is no Christopher Reeve. Here's the difference: Reeve's Superman had an almost self-deprecating, straight-faced-but-with-a-wink attitude about him. We felt that, while Supes does have abilities beyond those of mortal men, there was still a humanizing element about him that enabled us to put ourselves in his place. But Routh's Superman is so aware of the all-encompassing mission his father had given him that he comes off as somewhat aloof and detached. Oh, he smiles and waves but there isn't that same warmth we felt exuding from Reeve. In Superman I and II, it was Clark Kent who was playing Superman. In Superman Returns, Clark Kent seems to be the disguise.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer goes to great extent in showing the audience what it feels like for Kal-El to co-exist with beings infinitely more fragile than him, and the isolation and loneliness of his unending burden. Singer employs recurring shots of Superman hovering in space, gazing watchfully down on his adopted planet (or sometimes with his eyes close, so as to better focus his superhearing for any plea for aid). Superman's own personal life, in his own mind, must ever take a backseat to his ongoing pursuit of truth, justice and cheesecake.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is not as good as Margot Kidder or Teri Hatcher here, but she has room to grow. She lacks that certain sassiness that is a hallmark of Lois Lane. Given, Lois now has a child and is engaged, and is probably thrown off-keeled by Superman's return. But, still, I longed for that smart-alecky gleam in her eyes. Ah, well. Maybe, next time...Frank Langella is not crusty enough as Perry White, while Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen is forgettable. Eva Marie Saint, whom I loved in North by Northwest, didn't have enough screen time as Martha Kent. Kevin Spacey is on and off as Supe's arch nemesis Lex Luthor. There is one standout scene, though, which takes place on Lex's cruiseship, in which Lex, in traditional villainous, braggadocious fashion, unveils his mad scheme to Lois and then taunts her about Superman's guaranteed inability to foil his plan - this time. Parker Posey as Lex's sidekick chick Kitty is very funny and steals some scenes.<br /><br />So, I do recommend this film: for its sheer grandeur, the sense of nostalgia it invokes, and its sincere striving to be great. The production values are excellent and will make you believe that a Superman can fly at supersonic speeds, wrestle down a space shuttle, and stop a bullet with his eyeball. And this is only Brandon Routh's first try as the Man of Steel and there are sequels undoubtedly planned, so I expect him to grow into this role. Welcome back, Superman. I missed you, man.</p></body></html>

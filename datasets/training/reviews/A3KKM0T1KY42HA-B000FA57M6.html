<meta name="summary" content="Doom. Doom....Out Go The Lights!"></head><body><p>I was definitely entertained throughout Doom. It was an enjoyable action/horror/sci-fi movie that in my opinion is getting unjust treatment by the critics.<br /><br />A little bit Aliens. A tiny bit Predator. A lot Resident Evil. And, hey, I loved all three of those flicks. Resident Evil got crushed by the critics, and that was completely captivating if you're into the genre. Doom has some very similar parallels to the plot lines of the 3 aforementioned films. And also has some of its own merit. But overall it is a good, average, somewhat predictable (due to the familiarity with like story lines) fun film to watch.<br /><br />You've seen the story played out before: Something has gone wrong on a distant Earthly inhabitation of a remote planet (or moon...whatever). A team of soldiers are dispatched to search and destroy. But the soldiers soon find that they are the ones on the short end of the "being hunted" stick.<br /><br />There's some decent special effects. Some campy humor. And there's some fair at best acting. But as I said early, if you're into the genre, Doom is definitely worth a rental. It's a purchase only for the die-hard fan. Sorry Amazon.<br /><br />Lights out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Memorable "Memento""></head><body><p>Christopher Nolan's "Memento" is one of the landmark films of the new century.  The film is distinguished by powerhouse storytelling, snappy editing, and great acting.  The basic story concerns Leonard(Guy Pearce) a man suffering from short-term memory loss who is attempting to unravel the mystery of his wife's murder.  Leonard's efforts include a network of body tattoos, Polaroid pictures, and handwritten notes he leaves for himself.  As Leonard attempts to piece together the mystery the question arises as to the reliability of these reminders.  Leonard's condition also subjects him to the exploitation from some malevolent forces.  Pearce gives an extraordinary performance as Leonard and is ably supported by Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss, characters whose motives in "helping" Leonard could come under suspicion.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"></head><body><p>Willy Wonka (Depp) has been in seclusion for years.  One day, it is announced that Wonka has hidden five golden tickets in the wrappers of five million candy bars to be sold around the world.  Those who find the tickets will get a tour of the Wonka candy factory.  One by one, the tickets are found, and the winners are announced...Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Mike Teavee, and finally, Charlie Bucket.  The first four are gluttonous, spoiled, an overachiever, and a TV addict respectively.  Charlie, on the other hand, is just poor.  When the group arrives at the factory, they are all introduced into the the strange world of Willy Wonka.  Willy also tells the kids that one of them will get a special surprise.<br /><br />Johnny Depp plays Willy Wonka with a creepy intensity.  To say that he is odd would be an understatement, and most of the time he is acting unexpectedly.  The movie itself is a treat for the eyes, as most movies by Tim Burton are.  The chocolate factory is filled with wonders, and run by the Oompa Loompas, all played by actor Deep Roy.  They steal all the scenes that they are in, providing songs about the childrens' misguided actions.<br /><br />I have read that Roald Dahl's family is endorsing it, and can't help but think that most people will like it, especially if they liked the original.  Unfortunately for me, I found the movie only slightly less annoying than the original.  So, while I can say that it is an improvement, I can't say that it did much for me.</p></body></html>

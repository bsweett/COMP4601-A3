<meta name="summary" content="Small Town Football"></head><body><p>"Friday Night Lights", the inspiration for the 2006-2007 TV series of the same name, is an unflinchingly look at a small, economically-depressed Texas town where the only exciting event is the Friday night high school football game.  That kind of spotlight creates intense expectations for the Permian High School Football Team to succeed, causing players to make tough choices and live with the consequences.<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton does an inspiring turn as the football coach who rallies the team after a season-ending injury to a key player.  His leadership and mentoring of the team causes the players to come together and make the best of their situation and of each other.  The movie avoids a cliche ending but leaves the viewer with the sense that what the players accomplish together will be with them all their lives.<br /><br />This film is highly recommended as an excellent capture of high school sports as preparation for the challenges of adult life.</p></body></html>

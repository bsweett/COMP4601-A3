The other is a grim tale from Franco's Spain in 1944 and the struggle between the reigning forces and the opposition.  Parallel worlds intersect and clash, reaching a bittersweet ending where good triumphs over evil.<br /><br />The movie is filed with arresting images: the chattering mantis-like stick insect, wood nymphs, the horned faun and the cannibalistic Pale Man.<br /><br />Superb!</p></body></html>

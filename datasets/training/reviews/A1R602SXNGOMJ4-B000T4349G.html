I mean, it did hold my attention throughout the entire film but I'm still not sure what really happened.<br /><br />Telly is struggling to cope with the loss of her 9-year-old son. She is stunned when her psychiatrist and her husband tell her that she has created eight years of memories of a son she never had. But when she meets the father of one of her son's friend who is having the same experience, Telly embarks on a mission to prove her son's existence and her sanity.<br /><br />That's the plot but I don't understand it.</p></body></html>

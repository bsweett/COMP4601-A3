<meta name="summary" content="Close Encounters of the Third Kind"></head><body><p>Hollywood runs 10 years behind. My friends and I were watching for UFOs in 1966. Somehow, Dreyfuss got into the three biggest movies of the 1970s. In Close Encounters, he is obsessed with an image in his mind. It turns out to be Devil's Tower in Wyoming, a vertical monolith created by erosion and the nation's first National Monument. Dreyfuss is drawn to an alien landing. "The Third Kind" indicates actual contact with UFOs. The film tries to create a sense of realism. So far, UFO stories have been hoaxes and science fiction. Where does Dreyfuss go with his aliens?</p></body></html>

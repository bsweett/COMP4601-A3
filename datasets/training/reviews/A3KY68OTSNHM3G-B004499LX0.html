<meta name="summary" content="A Twisted Web of Lies and Deceit"></head><body><p>Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, Jude Law, and Clive Owen star in this seductive and sometimes trashy thriller about lies, deceit, and hurting the one you love.  Roberts stars as Anna, a portrait photographer who takes pictures of strangers.  Portman stars as Alice, a stripper/waitress who has just arrived in London after a failed relationship.  Law stars as Dan, an obituary writer who has dreams of becoming a successful novelist, and Owen stars as Larry, a dermatologist who is addicted to internet chat rooms.<br /><br />Dan meets Alice after she's hit by a taxi.  He takes her to the hospital and, after a while, a relationship forms, and Dan has begun work on his novel.  However, Dan also becomes involved with Anna (unknown to Alice).<br /><br />Larry is drawn in by Dan, who is posing as a woman on one of the chat rooms that Larry frequents.  Dan explains that his name is Anna and she wants to meet him.  Larry is given directions to Anna's photography gallery, where, after a brief amount of explaining, Larry and Anna form a relationship of their own and wind up getting married.<br /><br />Eventually, all four become intertwined with each other in a deceitful web of lies and mistrust.<br /><br />The characters do an excellent job of portraying the kind of relationship one hopes they never have; one based on lies and mistruths.  If you can stand the overabundance of very foul language, then you should enjoy this film.  The acting, especially by Natalie Portman, is very good, and Portman's portrayal of Alice is the highlight of the movie.  You'll also learn what you shouldn't do in a relationship: lie and cheat on the one you care about.</p></body></html>

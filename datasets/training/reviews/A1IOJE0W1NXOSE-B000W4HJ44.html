She goes home from school every day and watches the show while she and her best friend dance to the songs.  Her quest for fame soon becomes a desire for fairness as she becomes an integral part in fighting for the rights of those who are different.  This movie has a terrific cast who sing and dance with a delightful energy and enthusiasm.<br />It is highly recommended viewing.</p></body></html>

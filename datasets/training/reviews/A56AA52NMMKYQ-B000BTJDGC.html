<meta name="summary" content="Effectively blends horror and courtroom drama...."></head><body><p>This is not so much a horror movie (though there is an ample amount of creepiness) as much as it is an absorbing courtroom thriller.  The cast is first rate.  Laura Linney, Campbell Scott and Tom Wilkinson bring immense talent to the roles of courtroom combatants in trial over the death of a young woman who was allegedly possessed.  The movie leaves little doubt that she was - the question becomes whether the priest's intervention constituted negligence which led to Emily Rose's death.<br /><br />There are theological undertones in the film, good versus evil and he forces of evil at work in the world today.  It is a rebuff to atheists and agnostics alike; to acknowledge the role of the Devil must admit that as a foil there exists a God.  The movie avoids any preachy tone and it is supposedly based on a true story.<br /><br />The ending appears to be a less than satisfying "half a loaf" conclusion, and I will say no more lest I spoil it for those who have not yet seen the movie.<br /><br />A good film!</p></body></html>

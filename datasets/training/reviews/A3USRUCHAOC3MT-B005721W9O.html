No.  But if you like either comedies, Star Trek, or movies about people stepping up to responsibilities they were not sure they could handle, you will like this movie.<br /><br />I would divide what many call "science fiction" into three categories:<br /><br />1) "True Science Fiction", which is based on realistic speculation (e.g. "Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea," "Flowers For Algernon");<br /><br />2) "Science Fantasy", which has a space setting, but is more of a fantasy in space than something based on true speculation (e.g. "Star Wars"); and<br /><br />3) "Science Horror", which often leans more toward the first category, but in this case it is a horror story in a space/sci-fi setting (e.g. "Alien").<br /><br />This movie is clearly in the second category.<br /><br />I see parallels between this movie and two others.  One is "Three Amigos", another comedy about actors who are mistaken for being heroes, and finding themselves having to become heroes.  The other is "Space Camp", about a woman and several kids accidentally sent into space.  The "Three Amigos" parallel probably has been noted in other reviews; while this is more of a comedy, I feel with the size of the cast that there are a lot of similarities with "Space Camp."<br /><br />One thing I'll mention is that I am not really a Tim Allen fan.  I'm not a Tim Allen hater either, but for me, he was neither a draw nor, for the most part, a distraction from the movie.  I could never picture him being cast as a serious starship captain.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is good, though I think Sigourney Weaver was over-qualified as an actress for her role.  Alan Rickman was excellent in his role, an excellent crumudgeon.</p></body></html>

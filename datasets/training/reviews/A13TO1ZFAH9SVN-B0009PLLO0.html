<meta name="summary" content="One of the worst movies I've ever seen"></head><body><p>This movie is such a mess. There is so much to complain about, I'm not even sure where to start ripping apart at.<br /><br />The acting is horrible. Colin Farrel never has the look of an actor who is in command of the film. Mel Gibson had it in Braveheart and so did Russell Crowe in Gladiator. You never really get that in Alexander. I don't think Colin was a bad choice to play Alexander he just lacked the boldness of somewhat who accompished the things this man did. He lacks that scren presence.<br /><br />Val Kilmer is a great actor, but nothing is given to him to work with. He plays a fat old man, but when he is on screen he owns it. Phillip is a great character and it's a shame that Kilmer couldn't do more with him.<br /><br />Angelina is creepy at Olympia. Mythology said she served her gods, but the character is annoying in the film. All she does is complain and complain. I'm a huge Jolie fan, but I got tired of her scenes. They are all same. It's either kill your father Alexander or come home Alexander. Give her some more lines to work with.<br /><br />The homosexuality in the movie is a huge distraction and it hurts the movie a lot. History tells us that most men in that time period were known to swing both ways and especially men in power. Oliver Stone takes all of those scenes over the top. I was sick and tired of watching Colin and Jared Leto stare at each other passionately with cheesy backgroudn music. I got tired of seeing him do the same scenes with the guy from Babylon. I can't stand forced drama like this and I can't believe that Warner Brothers let Oliver Stone do it. Alexander should be known to the world as the great military leader he was. Nobody really cares if he was bi-sexual.<br /><br />The battle scenes are some of the worst I've ever seen. Capitol One should check into a law suit because Oliver Stone copied the armies from there commercials. I was just waiting for one of the warriors to scream out "What's in Your Wallet." The scenes are bloody but without all the gore. I wanted to see a battle, not a big bloody mess like all these scenes were.<br /><br />Oliver Stone really needs to be slapped upside his head for this movie. He didn't do his homework at all. I've always felt the guy was overrated. He should take some heat for putting together this $300 million dollar piece of junk. To add insult to injury the movie is three hours long.<br /><br />This movie truly was an epic. It was an epic to see if I could stay awake and make it out alive. The theater I saw it in was half crowded and everybody was ripping the film. All the critics have been right in ripping it. This movie could go down as one of the worst ever and rightfully so. There is nothing that could make me sit down and watch this film again. Nobody should be but subject to that punishment. Save yourself some time, brain cells, and money by missing this film. At least when Troy butchered The Illiad, they made the movie fun.</p></body></html>

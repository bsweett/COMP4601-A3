The cast includes: Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth, Kevin Durand (LOST) as Blob, Dominic Monaghan as Bolt, Taylor Kitsch as Gambit, Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, and Tim Pocock as Cyclops. Plus many many more.<br /><br />But like I said most characters are a fleeting guest. This movie revolves around Wolverine vs Sabertooth vs William Stryker. An officer who is trying to "build" a team of super-humans. I quote the term build because it's a plot device. I don't want to spoil the film if you haven't seen it.<br /><br />The movie shows Sabretooth and Wolverine to be related. They both survive multiple wars until they are recruited by Stryker.<br /><br />Things have a way of going bad and Wolverine quits.<br /><br />Flash forward a few years and someone is killing off the team of super-humans on Stryker's team.<br /><br />But there's more to Stryker than building a team.<br /><br />This film has some cussing in it. The violence is PG-13 which means there's hardly any blood (if any). There's no sexual content except for a scene with Wolverine and his girlfriend? resting in bed.<br /><br />X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a good summer eye-candy flick. Some of the diehard fans of certain characters won't be happy with what was done to their favorites, but I thought it was a fun film.<br /><br />Be sure to stick around after the credits for a short scene.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Slick, Constantly Interesting Thriller, & Incredible Story"></head><body><p>'The Interpreter' has strong cast, slick direction, and authentic mood (the film being pastly shot in the real United Nations building).  If the film had been shot in the 70s, the incredible story (and especially its ending) might have sounded more plausible.  As it is, with today's more complex political situations surrounding the UN, 'The Interpreter' remains just an OK thriller -- entertaining, but ultimately unbelievable.<br /><br />Of course, you don't have to make everything believable in thrillers, but I point out this obvious thing about reality because 'The Interpreter' starts with an excellent premise.  While in a booth in the UN Headquarter in New York, an  interpreter Silvia Bloom (Nicole Kidman) happens to overhear part of conversation (in one African fictional language Ku), which strongly suggest that one assassination plot is going on.  And that assassination, as she learns later, might happen here, in the UN.<br /><br />Consequently, security agent Tobin Keller is called in, who at first does not buy her story.  However, as the story unfolds, several incidents happen to Silvia, and Tobin starts to guard her with his men, thinking that there is a possiblity that she is still lying to him, or to us audiences.<br /><br />You get two superstars -- Nicole Kidman as UN translator, and Sean Penn as security guard.  Both do not disappoint us, but I must say there is no chemstry between them.  As the film is basically a thriller, well, I can ignore that flaw, but not this one, which is the film's too complicated and incredible story about assassnation.<br /><br />Think about this.  If you're a president of some country, and is being accused of tyranny (I hope you're not!), would you come all the way to New York City where most likely you will not be welcomed?  And when you might be assassinated?  His motive is explained in the end, which -- excuse me for using strong words, but ... which is an insult to our intelligence.  And Nicole Kidman's character, at first a pretty credible one, gradually becomes awfully contrived and even ridiculous (sorry I cannot revela that part).  Do you believe all of her 'past'?<br /><br />Despite the great cast including Catherine Keener, Yvan Attal, Jesper Christensen, Earl Cameron, George Harris, Hugo Speer, Clyde Kusatsu, and Michael Wright, their characters are all pieces of a big puzzle, which is not uninteresting itself, and considering the complexity of the material, Sydney Pollack did a superb job with his slick direction (as in seen in 'The Firm'), but all in all I was not intrigued by the whole film, of which politics are outmoded, and even silly in this post 9/11 world.  Good acting, lots of suspence, not-so-good story.</p></body></html>

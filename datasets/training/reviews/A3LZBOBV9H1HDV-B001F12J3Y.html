Tom Hanks is impressive in 6 roles. Those roles are Hero Boy, Hero Boy's Father, Conductor, Hobo, Scrooge, and Santa Claus. He voices 5 of them and his motion capture is on all 6 of them. Robert Zemeckis' directing is excellent. The powerful emotion of the movie stays with you even until after the movie is over.</p></body></html>

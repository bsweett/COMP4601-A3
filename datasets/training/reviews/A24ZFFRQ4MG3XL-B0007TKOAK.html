<meta name="summary" content="Good but long"></head><body><p>I rushed to see this at the theatre on it's first weekend before I'd hear anyone's opinion on it, and before all the tv commercials came out to ruin it.  I was looking forward to seeing it since all the interviews with the actors made it seem like a great film.  And I did enjoy it, but I thought it was a little long winded.  I thought it was funny and sad at the same time, but I got restless and lost focus on it.  It is a good movie, but didn't quite live up to the hype surrounding it.  The acting was good (maybe not Oscar winning material) but it just wasn't enough to hold my interest.  Sorry.</p></body></html>

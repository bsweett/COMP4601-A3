<meta name="summary" content="Works Best as a Tribute to Earlier Monster Movies"></head><body><p>Ever more interested in visual stylizations than story or pacing, Tim Burton is in good form for the first half of "Sleepy Hollow," which "borrows" liberally from the Hammer films that starred more than a few actors in this cast.  Here, talented Johnny Depp brings to life a different Ichabod Crane than the schoolteacher imagined by Washington Irving -- more Poe's Dupin, he is an anachronistic detective seeking scientific plausibility in his investigation of gruesome murders.  That "Sleepy Hollow" manages to evoke memories of Saturday afternoon monster thrillers is its biggest strength; rapid descent into talky romantic pablum and hocus pocus is its undoing, as the sparks between Depp and the dour but childlike Christina Ricci misfire, and the denouement is surprisingly tensionless.  Students of literature will find little of the short story upon which the film is loosely based except character names, but fans of everything from "The Brides of Dracula" to the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes thrillers will get visual treats.  The climax in a windmill -- despite the tiresome need for rather illogical pyrotechnics -- is right out of a horror movie (and, perhaps, Hitchcock's "Foreign Correspondent.")  Though the bloodletting is rather, well, bloodless, the violence in the film is amped up enough psychologically to make the film non-kid friendly, and Burton can't resist his predictable need to shock by turning, in this case, a rather pleasant bedtime moment into a family's massacre.  It's really worth about three and a half stars, but with Amazon's system, I'll round up to four because of the appearances of so many great character actors -- look for them yourself.</p></body></html>

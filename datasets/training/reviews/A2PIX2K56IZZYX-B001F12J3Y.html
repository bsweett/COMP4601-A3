<meta name="summary" content="Visually Stunning...................."></head><body><p>Me and the wife just finished "The Polar Express" and we both thought the same thing, that this was one of the most beautifully made movies the two of us have ever seen. I am a Christmas fanatic, and this ranks right up there with some of the all time classics. Why not 5 stars you may ask? Well, simple, as you know, I rarely give 5 stars to any movie or game, and the only Christmas movie I would ever give 5 stars to is 'It's a wonderfull life', answer your question? good, moving on......<br /><br />Tom Hanks does the voices for 5 characters I believe, and he does them pretty well, but you can tell its him in all of them, so thats not so good, but besides that minimal flaw and very few others this CGI miracle is amazing. Now, I am not a huge fan of CG, in fact, I find it ruins alot of decent movies, but not in Polar Express. The CG is breath-taking, the snowstorm is astonishing and the train itself is a wonder to behold. The colors are bright when need be, and quiet and deep in the more emotinal scenes. The 3 main child characters are all delightfull, the only exception being a loud, obnoxious, nerdy kid along for the ride who didn't really fit and was not necessary. If they needed comic relief in the form of a sidekick why not have a dog or even a cat along for the ride, that is always a good fit, especially in a Christmas movie.<br /><br />Another one of my slight flaws is that the expressions on most of the characters don't change much, but it's really not a big deal cuz' you are too busy ooing and awing over every brilliant scene or location. Not only is the train a spectacle but once they arrive at the North Pole, it gets even better. The imagination that went into this is one-of-a-kind. I don't think we are going to see another movie as visually stunning as this in quite a long time.<br /><br />Is this the best CG movie I have ever seen? pretty close race, but I'd give the edge to Nemo, so it gets a strong 2nd place, It's better then both Toy Story's (both are amazing 4 star movies) and a little better then Ice Age or Monsters, Inc. I know there is more of them, but they are mostly 3 stars and below.<br /><br />I do strongly recommend this for any child and there family, I can't wait to watch it again, but I'm going to hold off on buying it.....The special features are suprisingly lacking, no behind the scenes, deleted scenes, bloopers, or anything, so I thinking the re-release will be packed, until next time, take care all.<br /><br />acting..........4 stars, Hanks is solid as usual<br /><br />directing........4.5 stars, Zemecki's vision is amazing<br /><br />special effects.....5 stars, CG at it's best, no equal.....yet<br /><br />kid, comedy rating....4 stars, Some goofy moments, but mostly a pretty serious movie with a strong message<br /><br />quality........4.5 stars, One of the better looking movies ever</p></body></html>

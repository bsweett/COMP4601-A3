<meta name="summary" content="The best adaptation of a Marvel comic...yet"></head><body><p>First, I'll admit that I have never read a Punisher comic; thus, I had no expectations going in when I saw the movie upon its release.  That is probably why I saw it with an open mind, not have any comic reference to build on.<br /><br />The film stands on its own as a testament to the pitfalls of revenge, on both the "good" guy and the "bad" guy's part.  Thomas Jane plays the federal agent who runs afoul of a villainous John Travolta and both actors jump headfirst into their respective roles.<br /><br />Jane garners sympathy as a man who avenges the death of his entire family, including his wife and son.  He masters an ingenious plot to not only destroy his mortal enemy, John Travolta (the man behind the massacre) but drives a wedge between Travolta and his wife as well as Travolta's "aide-de-camp."<br /><br />The good performances of Jane and Travolta are matched by James Carpinello as Travolta's twin sons, Samantha Mathis as Travolta's wife, and Will Patton as Travolta's number one henchman.  Rebecca Romijn, Ben Foster, and John Pinette are wonderful as three apartment dwellers that form a bond with Jane's "Frank Castle" character.<br /><br />The body count is great as are the graphic measures that Castle takes to "rub out" Travolta's minions.<br /><br />The DVD offers viewers a chance to see an animated beginning, detailing some story elements that were not produced for the original film but gives some necessary plot information.<br /><br />I would probably give the DVD five stars if it had a "how-to" workout regimen that Jane took in order to get as buff as he is in the film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Child of woman"></head><body><p>In particular, a young woman, pretty, and marked by her face as an outsider in a country that cages outsiders like cattle. The child, in particular, is hers. It's also the first human baby born in nearly twenty years, since some unstated catastrophe ended every human pregnancy - and stopped every other pregnancy since, except hers. She's so young that she never even saw a baby, except in pictures, and now she has one. The only one.<br /><br />But the world around her has gone to hell, or maybe become a hell. "After the fall" movies have been around for a long time: Soylent Green, Hurt's 1984, Bladerunner, and many others, always fallen just a bit farther than the one before. Now we have Children of Men. Skies are stained with smoke, streets are littered since no one cares, and the government ration boxes include suicide kits - the ones advertised on subsidized TV. It's just too believable.<br /><br />I can't say there's a real plot to this movie. It's a small kind of quest, maybe just a trek through concentration camps, buildings burning in urban combat, and scorched earth. Michael Caine puts in a superb performance, since he doesn't know how to do anything else. This time, he's an aging hippie, but also a very brave and pacifist combatant in that war that seems to have no reason, and something even braver for his wife. Claire-Hope Ashitey, an emerging star, plays the young mother (or new Eve) with quiet beauty and charm. The rest of the movie doesn't conspicuously manipulate our feelings until the end, but we want it by then.<br /><br />I'm still not quite sure what to make of this movie, or even whether I want to see it again. I came away impressed, though, and moved in ways that I don't have good words for.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

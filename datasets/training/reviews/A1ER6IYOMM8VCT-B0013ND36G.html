<meta name="summary" content="DISAPPOINTING ENTRY CAMERON AND HAMLITON ARE SORELY MISSED!"></head><body><p>The Terminator series has a huge fan base and I was looking forward to this installment. Unfortunately James Cameron is out..ditto Linda Hamilton. When a director and one of the stars decline to sign on, you know you're headed for trouble! The story is ambitious, but trying too hard to top the jokes of T2 they lose sight of the serious core that have made the first two film so good. The TX...well she's hot and the FX are good, the character seems to fall flat like almost everything in this film. It's an OK film at best, but with a running time of an hour and 40 minutes this film seemed longer than the second film which runs 2 1/2 hours!<br /><br />If your a fan of the series you will probably want to see this, but Terminator Salvation should have been the third film not this overblown and surprisingly boring entry. The two disc DVD has a nice DVD transfer, but I didn't find the extra material to be all that great. Of course the usual commentaries and trailers are present, but who cares? Arnold should have rejected this half hearted clunker and had more than just a CGI cameo part in T4 Salvation!</p></body></html>

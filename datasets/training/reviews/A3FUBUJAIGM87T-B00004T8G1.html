<meta name="summary" content="3.5 STARS: Atmospheric ghost story that can produce chills in the audience."></head><body><p>John Carpenter has long been one of my favorite horror movie directors ever since I can remember liking horror movies. Actually, I like many of his other movies too like the sci-fi/horror classic "The Thing" and the underrated "Escape from New York" just to name a few. To say that "Halloween" is the movie that has defined his career would be an understatement. Certainly, it was after the blockbuster success of "Halloween" that Carpenter realized that he really had a knack for horror cinema.<br /><br />A couple of years later in 1980, Carpenter made "The Fog" which was no where near the success of "Halloween", but one can see similarities in style and in the cast as well. While certainly not a classic, "The Fog" is an atmospheric ghost story that is creepy enough for a late night horror viewing experience. Carpenter does a good job once again of creating suspense and building tension in the audience. The fog itself is a brilliant mechanism to keep the audience in the dark about the evil that is lurking within the fog. The dark manifestations of the apparitions are quite creepy.<br /><br />The story behind the fog is interesting to a certain degree, and it does make sense. However, "The Fog" may have explained too much to the viewer because sometimes it is the lack of motive behind the horrific acts of the villain that makes us scared. Not that it hurts the movie too much, but Carpenter tries to explain things in this movie and some of the mystery behind the supernatural (at least with regard to motive) is unfortunately lost. In other words, Carpenter humanizes the supernatural with the motive in this movie, and that reduces the horror to a certain extent. Consequently, the movie really is not that scary, but it is creepy, atmospheric and eerie at times. Once again, I love the pulsating mood music Carpenter employs in "The Fog", but it is not enough to make this movie into a classic. I think it is interesting that many people perceive "The Fog" as a classic now as opposed to when it came out because when it first came out, it was not exactly received all that well. However, as time has gone by, people perceive "The Fog" to be somewhat of a classic, and I think that is the product of time itself. In other words, a decent movie like "The Fog" back in the early 80s has been given classic status nowadays because of the garbage that has been produced in the horror genre over the last seventeen plus years.<br /><br />Still, "The Fog" is a good and creepy movie with quite a few eerie scenes. I was very impressed with the acting in this movie. I thought it was really interesting the way Carpenter used so many familiar faces in this movie from the original "Halloween". Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Loomis and Charles Cyphers were all in "Halloween". Tom Atkins would also star in "Halloween III" as did Nancy Loomis to the tune of a lesser role. Adrienne Barbeau also starred in several Carpenter movies including "Escape from New York" as did Charles Cyphers to a lesser role. I believe Carpenter and Barbeau would marry as well. Alas, I digress. The point is that there are quite a few familiar faces in this movie from other Carpenter movies, and along with the directing, the acting was very good. The special effects are pretty good for this type of movie, but there is very little blood and gore much to the chagrin of you gorehounds out there.<br /><br />The concept behind "The Fog" is probably the kind of idea that looks great on paper, but is actually very difficult to execute as a convincing horror flick. I have always argued that ghost stories and haunted house movies are the most difficult horror movies to make, and while it does not have to be realistic per se, it does need to be convincing...there is a difference. For the most part, Carpenter was able to pull this off, but toward the end, I think the savvy horror movie viewer can see that the supernatural element to this movie was difficult to develop and remain scary at the same time. In a sense, one has to keep the interest of the viewer without revealing too much at the same time, and that is difficult to do. For all intents and purposes, Carpenter achieves this in "The Fog", but for one reason or another, this movie just is not a classic, probably because of how difficult it is to execute and the limitations of what one can do with a movie like this. In other words, "The Fog" really does not have the potential to be a classic horror movie in the true sense of the term.<br /><br />In conclusion, "The Fog" is an entertaining and creepy horror movie that is good for rainy Saturday nights, preferably late because I think one is better able to identify with and relate to the spirit of the movie under the right circumstances. In wrapping this review up, I should point out that the remake of "The Fog" was an absolute disaster, so I would advise you not to waste your time or money there.</p></body></html>

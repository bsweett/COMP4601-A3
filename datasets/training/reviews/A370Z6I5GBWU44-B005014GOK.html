If you're a fan of Danny Trejo, this is definitely the film for you, as he is the star 'Machete' and kicks plenty of @$$ in this movie! You also get Jessica Alba and Steven Seagal playing supporting roles in this movie. Some of the scenes might be campy or overblown to some, but to me, it just adds some charm. Well, as much charm as a violent movie can have, at least. Plenty of explosions, shoot-outs, and confrontations make this a movie that you shouldn't be bored of. :P</p></body></html>

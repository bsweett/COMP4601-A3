But about two thirds of the way into the film you realize it's not going anywhere with that great start. And then in the last five minuites (and it takes forever to get to those last minuites and I'm not spoiling anything here, trust me) - anyways, in the last five minuites it almost redeems itself but it's just gone too far off track to actually make it worth it. <p>I watched this with some friends during a horror-movie-watching fest, and at that two thirds mark we started making fun of it. Up till then we'd been riveted, glued to the movie. After that, we just gave up and mocked it. <p>With about, oh, half an hour or forty-five minuites cut out of it it might be worth it. There are some great scenes, some great ideas. And you should probably watch it at least once, so you can say you did, and out of curiosity. Plus, there really are some great scenes. But it's so definitely not worth a second watch.<p>If it were a bit tighter, leaner, edited better, if it didn't go so far over the top on a little acid-trip diversion, then it would be such a good film. I know the acid-trip bit was intentional, but it took too long. It's like a dramatic silent pause that goes too long: everyone will be quiet, and everyone will hold their breath for only so long: then the drama goes out of it and you start laughing at what might otherwise have been something tense. Maybe that was intentional, I dunno.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Little Too Similar to the Infinitely Better "Lock, Stock"."></head><body><p>&#8220;Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels&#8221; reinvented the British Gangster film and gave the world a Great new director, Guy Ritchie. &#8220;Snatch&#8221; is Guy&#8217;s Second film, and although it doesn&#8217;t reinvent any genres, it is still one of the most Fun Gangster films Ever made.<p>The Story is far too complex to summarize, so I&#8217;ll just jump straight into the Review. Everything that made &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221; such a Success is Here in Abundance, The Oddball Characters, the Ultra-Slick Dialogue, the Over-the-top Violence, &#8220;Snatch&#8221; has Everything &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221; had Except it&#8217;s Freshness and Originality.<p>The Performances, Familiar or Fresh, are Wonderful. The Casting of Brad Pitt and the Creation of his Odd-ball Character was a Stroke of Genius. Vinnie Jones might as well have been called Chris (his character from &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221;), as his Bullet-tooth Vic character here is virtually Identical to him in Every Way. Dennis Farina does his Mob guy routine again and it&#8217;s as Funny as Ever. Jason Statham isn&#8217;t really good enough of an Actor to Lead the film, he fit better as Bacon in &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221;, the Ultra-Slick dialogue comes out of him a little Stunted, but he&#8217;s Likeable enough. Benicio Del Toro is as Wonderful as Ever, his lack of Screen time downright Angers me. In the end it was Rade Serbedzija as Boris the Blade who I wanted to Win the Day. He is a Character that Cannot be Killed and an Actor who Cannot give a Bad Performance. (eg. &#8220;Eyes Wide Shut&#8221;, &#8220;The Saint&#8221;, &#8220;Space Cowboys&#8221; and &#8220;Mission Impossible 2&#8221;<p>&#8220;Snatch&#8221; has Stacks of memorable scenes, Dozens of Quotable lines and a Cast full of Bad guys and Worse guys who you Can&#8217;t Help but Like. Fans of Crime-Capers, British Humour and&#8230; of course &#8220;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&#8221; will Obviously enjoy this film. They should also check out the Criminally Underrated &#8220;Love, Honour and Obey&#8221;.</p></body></html>

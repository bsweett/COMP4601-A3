<meta name="summary" content="Kinda ruin the mood with a movie preview in your face..."></head><body><p>I wanted to see Its a wonderful life, but was subjected to a movie preview before<br />the magic hit me.......What a bad decision by the studios...but this is not the<br />first time...ive been getting VHS (noy yet on DVD) and even if the movie is a<br />classic from the old days,  they tag movie preview from today's movie on it.<br />Its bad, but they need the money you know....<br /><br />For the movie, hey...loved it in black and white...and love it in Color. Seeing it<br />in black and white for the first time is almost a must, because some scenes have<br />more emotional value to them when filmed in black and white. Then when you see<br />the film in color you can feel the difference.<br /><br />Great film for all..and nicely restored versions....enjoy.</p></body></html>

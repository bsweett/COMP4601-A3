<meta name="summary" content="A Great Story of American Heroes"></head><body><p>On the horrible day of 9/11/01, there were few bright spots.  The heroism of the passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 was a major exception.<br /><br />The events are well known to all.  On the day when four airliners were hijacked by radical Islamic terrorists, those on this craft fought back.  After the killers took over the airplane, several of those on board spoke with their loved ones by phone.  They found out about the other airliners that were flown into the World Trade Center and decided to go down fighting.  This is their story.<br /><br />The creators of this movie did a great job of recreating the events of that day.  It is very well done and very powerful.  Every American should watch this and honor their memories.</p></body></html>

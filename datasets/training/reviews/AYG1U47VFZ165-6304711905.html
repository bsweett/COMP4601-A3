<meta name="summary" content="The Director's Cut Hits The Bullseye"></head><body><p>Although I'm a greater fan of the Lawrence Kasdan / Kevin Costner version of Wyatt Earp's life, TOMBSTONE -- the Director's Cut -- is a marked improvement from the original threatrical version.  Several key scenes are extended from the original release, and many new scenes are added that give the characters a bit more emotional depth.  While much of the action still remains over the top, Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer epitomize the violence so prevalent between the lawmen and the Cowboys of the time period.  Don't be duped, however, by the documentaries; they're very short, and they truly don't add much to the experience.  While some interesting tidbits are thrown out about the making of the picture, very little is of relative substance.</p></body></html>

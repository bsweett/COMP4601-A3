<meta name="summary" content="Not one of Denzel Washington's Better Films"></head><body><p>I really could not take anything out of this movie.  The middle of the film was quite suspenseful but the ending was strange I thought, almost like there was going to be a part 2.  Think I had seen that somewhere that there was going to be a part 2.  A better ending could have changed my opinion since I feel an ending came make or break a movie.  For the casual D. Washington, fan look at training day or john q instead.<br /><br />Peter J.

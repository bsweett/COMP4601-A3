<meta name="summary" content="One of the best action films ever."></head><body><p>Nearly 20 years since its release, &quot;The Terminator&quot; still has the juice to stand up to the Hollywood dreck that's being released today.  In a nutshell, a cyborg (Schwarzenegger) has been sent from the future to kill a woman (Hamilton) and prevent her from giving birth to her son.  Meanwhile, an agent (Beihn) is also sent from the future to protect her. I won't go into further plot details, but this film grabs your attention from the opening credits to the last frame. Even the special effects hold up well after all these years.  If you have a taste for sci-fi inspired action, you cannot go wrong with &quot;The Terminator!&quot;</p></body></html>

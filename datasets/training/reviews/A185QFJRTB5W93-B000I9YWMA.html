<meta name="summary" content="A Nice Twist"></head><body><p>Overall a nice twist on the tale of Jack the Ripper.  The film went in depth with what could have been the motive behind the 1888 slayings in Whitechapel.  We will never know the true story, but From Hell delivers an explanation the plays well as both an enjoyable film and a stab at one of history's most notorious figures.  Brutal, sad, and thought provoking.  A definite recommendation!</p></body></html>

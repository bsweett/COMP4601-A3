<meta name="summary" content="Overkill..."></head><body><p>House of 1000 Corpses is a horror film that takes the word overkill to the literal meaning.  Two college couples are on their way home to the father of one the girls when they find out about a local mass murder of innocent patients in a mental hospital decades ago.  Their curiosity wants to take them to the tree where the killer, Dr. Satan, was hanged, but instead their car breaks down.  Soon they find themselves among insane people who practice witchcraft, cannibalism, and murder for pleasure.  As a cinematic experience this film offers some interesting shots, cinematography, and editing, but this too seems to be driven to overkill and makes the story a feast in repetitious carnage.  Thus, the story seems lost, but the violence keeps the audience's attention due to its graphic and abnormally painful nature.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An excellent spooky film!"></head><body><p>Okay, someone PLEASE explain to me HOW Nicole Kidman did not win an Oscar for her superb performance in this film, ...<p>But The Others...now this is a good film.  It's one of those European horror films, which already makes it better than most American films (forget the production values or Tom Cruise as the producer, this is NOT a typical Hollywood film).  It probably helps that the director, most of the cast, and most of the production team are European.  Plus, filming was done in Europe.  The result is one of the best haunted house films in a long time.  In a nutshell, the plot is about a family (Kidman and her, uh, 2 kids; the husband is off at war) near the end of WWII who begin to believe their home (one of those great crumbly mansions with long halls and dark chambers) is haunted.  But is it truly haunted or is Kidman slowly going mad? ....  These are but a few possibilities in this genuinely spooky film.  <p>What's more, the suspense is achieved almost entirely by direction, set design, sound, and acting.  The 2 kids are simply amazing.  The girl in particular is easily the equal of "Sixth Sense" Haley Joel Osment.  Kidman is a revelation, her controlled and mannered performance probably the best I've seen her do.  Special effects play almost no role in this film (to be honest, there are special effects but they are so well-disguised that you would never have known it unless the 2nd disc of this 2-DVD set revealed them.).  It is a bit like the film Castaway, which had a lot of special effects that were darn invisible.  I much prefer this sort of filming, where the special effects augment the storyline, rather than calling attention to themselves.  The strength of this film is that...even without any special effects at all, it would still be a powerful film.  Now that's good filmmaking!<p>...Guaranteed to be scary!</p></body></html>

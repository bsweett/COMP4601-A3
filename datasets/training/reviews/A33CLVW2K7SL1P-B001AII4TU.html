<meta name="summary" content="Not quite so charming this time"></head><body><p>While a girl under the age of 10 was highly amused by this film (she laughed from beginning to end), she was mostly the lone voice in the theater. Some of the jokes have grown old, and others just weren't funny. Certain story elements didn't seem to fit, not for me at least. Bringing King Arthur in to rule over the magical land of Far, Far Away seemed a bit of a stretch. He's not exactly a fairy-tale creature as much as he is a legendary king (real or mythical).<br /><br />Shrek 4 has already been given a thumbs up, and I hope that everyone goes back to the drawing board and tries a bit harder the next time around. In the first two films they made us believe the unbelievable. This time they gave us scenes that were completely unbelievable. Prince Charming, capturing a kingdom and using theater to bring down his arch-enemy (Shrek)? Ah, no, that was just silly and uninspired.<br /><br />Pinocchio's lawyer-speak scene was funny, and so were a few with the gingerbread man. Let's hope they can bring all of the magic back next time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Paradise Lost.....again.."></head><body><p>By now anyone going to a Terrence Mallick film should know what he is going to get: gorgeous cinematography of the landscape and environment, interesting production details, minimal dialogue,  voice-over narration of a poetic and philosophical bent, and exhaltation of nature and a mourning for the loss of innocence.  All are present here in abundance, and your appreciation of the film will depend greatly on your acceptance and enjoyment of his technique and themes, or not.<br /><br />Frankly, I waver back and forth on Mallick's film-making style.  I argued vociferously with friends over the merits of The Thin Red Line.  And yet, I could understand their impatience with the intermitten "poetic" fancies.  And there is a certain underlying naivete to his views of nature being paradisical and the notion of the "noble savage" the pure innocence of "primitive" man in nature that sometime smacks of Philosophy 101.  Likewise, his romanticism and poetic flights can be simplistic and mythic.<br /><br />But I always find his films interesting and beautiful to watch.  He is usually greatly helped by the fine actors that always want to work with him, and never more so than here with Christopher Plummer, Colin Farrell and Christian Bale.  And a master-stroke of casting and good luck was his find of the young Q'orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas, who is the heart and soul of the film.  She is graceful, lovely and simply luminous, and makes the story of her life and the men who loved her absolutely believable.<br /><br />Amidst his romanticism, Mallick has always been able to find the harsh realities as well.  The spree killings in Badlands, the  betrayal and murder in Days of Heaven , combat in The Thin Red Line.  Here it is the harshness and disintegration of Jamestown, depicted vividly and memorably.<br /><br />Also, whatever I thought I knew about the Pocahontas story was sadly lacking, and I found much information here, if correct, with which I was unfamiliar.  And it is a fascinating story.<br /><br />So, this is a film that will not appeal to a broad audience.  Mallick's technique is a real turn-off to many viewers.  Even though I admire much of the film, at times I get impatient with it as well.  I find, for me, the incredible sense of "this is what it must have been like" to encounter this "New World" of pristine forest and river and marsh worth indulging the rest.  "This is the forest primeval" indeed, and the people and land have never been depicted more forcefully.  It envelops you.<br /><br />Finally, there is a love story (or actually two) told here that, in the end, is worth seeing.  So, my recommendation is for those with the patience to let a film unfold in its own way, and for those not off-put by fragmented, sometimes enigmatic, voice-over musings as narration.  The film can be trying, but it has its own rewards.</p></body></html>

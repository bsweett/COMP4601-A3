<meta name="summary" content=""Torture Cinema" In The Cartoon Age--Nothing Real Is At Stake In This Hostel"></head><body><p>With the resurgence of exploitation films--I'll refer to the phenomena as "Torture Cinema"--we've really brought some unpleasant films into the mainstream. Some are good, some are not--just like any genre--but what's fascinating to me is how accepted they have now become. When I was growing up, pictures like "I Spit On Your Grave" and "Last House on the Left" were considered vile films and they had to be discovered. A largely underground, low budget, and independent film community had to support these controversial, malicious films. By today's standards these films still hold unpleasantness but are relatively mild--and graphic torture, violence and gore are at every local mall.<br /><br />I like "Torture Cinema" done well--it doesn't offend me any more than any other film subject. I recently weighed in with a positive review of the Australian film "Wolf Creek". That film became a target of Roger Ebert who regarded it as the most vile sort of exploitation. I'm baffled about why that film was so singled out in an era when anything is permissible. That film had a believability about it, real characters and intelligence. True fans of gore and torture were disappointed because none of that happens until the end, only three people are involved, and much of the violence is offscreen. And yet, while the film might not be for everyone, I will defend it with my last breath as a good movie (and certainly not the appropriate choice to make your example of wretched excess).<br /><br />I bring that film up only as a contrast for "Hostel," another film that doesn't offend me--but also holds none of the artistic merit. "Hostel" is the epitome of "Torture Cinema" as a cartoon. The characters, and I use the term lightly, are American horndogs out for partying and sex. No development or care is spent with fleshing them out as real people--and that's fine. It's night after night of debauchery, scantily clad females, and drinking until suddenly things take a turn for the worse. No one can claim that the beginning of "Hostel" makes a great movie--but what it did for me was to establish boorish character types that I was eager to see dispatched, the more gruesome the better. It was all so fake, no emotion or concern was really at stake.<br /><br />Now the torture, the deaths--they're fine. For those seeking truly demented scenes, there probably isn't enough gore. For those not accustomed to the genre, there's probably too much. The scenes are well shot and executed. But bottom line, while the situation is somewhat plausible, none of the film has led you to experience any realness. So I watched these scenes with amusement, some entertainment, but no real investment in the outcome. And it's all pretty forgettable when you're not connected in any way.<br /><br />And then the hilarious capper to this cartoonish tale--during the escape, our hero accidentally encounters everyone involved with getting him into this predicament and has a chance to wreak vengeance. It's preposterous, empty headed--but slick enough. I hold nothing against this picture. It's not the horror classic some make it out to be, but if you like the stuff--it can be interesting enough. It's harmless entertainment--unless you don't think it's entertainment. KGHarris, 11/06.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good movie"></head><body><p>But the movie had me very confused in the end. Other than the other errors of the movie, it was the ending that didn't make any sense. I could not understand how Alexa could be in two places at once. Is she omnipresent? How could she be in the back of the truck helping Marie and be driving the truck? Or driving behind the truck or being in a car accident and be driving the truck as well? Either Alexa is Schizophrenic or the director is. Other than the "twist in the end" confusion, it was a very good movie that could be very scarey and gorey as well. See the movie if you would like a different scarey movie, but be aware of the ending and don't hold your hopes too high.</p></body></html>

Spaghetti Westerns reach their zenith in this grand epic that tracks the inter-weaving adventures of three very different, but similarly driven gunfighters in the waning days of the civil war.  The seemingly convoluted plot has Clint, Lee, and Eli racing towards a quarter million dollars in gold.  Each man holds a piece of the puzzle and needs the other to complete it.  Beautifully filmed and paced, all the sand, grit, blood and sweat combine with that haunting musical score to hold the viewer breathless.  The character studies are equally interesting, the more time we spend with the principals the less we ultimately know about them.  Brutal commentaries on the absurdities of war are as timely now as presumably they were back then, especially the bridge scenes.  Through it all, Clint rises above as the omni-powerful Blondie, always a step ahead and almost paternalistic in his treatment of Tuco.  Lee Van Cleef oozes black bile as Angel Eyes, and ranks up there in Western if not all film villainy.  It is a tiring movie to watch, the journey seems to take so long but you realize with each scene that you're seeing great directing, acting and period pieces.  It looks beautiful on widescreen TVs, definitely recommended.</p></body></html>

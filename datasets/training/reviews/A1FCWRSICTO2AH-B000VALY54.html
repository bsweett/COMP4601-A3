The cast is good (Val Kilmer, Robert Downey Jr., and Michelle Monaghan), and there is genuine chemistry between the three.  But the story is something else.  It's a mess, and has you thinking this might be a cut and paste effort at comic noir from a 5 year old, except 5 year olds don't think (hopefully) about such things as severed fingers and corpses in showers - and more importantly, they still retain a sense of wonder that invests whatever they do. In contrast, KK, BB, is as stale a cut and paste effort as you will find.  Even the "funny" moments seem tired and familiar.  If you were to sit down and watch "Fargo", or "The Ice Harvest", and then try and watch KK, BB, I doubt you could even finish watching it - the movie is that embarrassing.  One thing about noir, even if the story doesn't make sense, the fallback is Style.  And again, KK, BB, falls short.  Yeah, it takes place in LA, and you get to see the inevitable party scene, but it goes nowhere.  Gunfire, bodies here and there, a car chase, a goofy bed time scene, a whiff of incest that is delivered in the most ho-hum way.  Wet noodles from Sin City.  Two stars for the acting trio trying to stay afloat in a story that never really meshes.</p></body></html>

I own Resident Evil 2 and 3 for my Sony Playstation, and now I've grown to love zombie movies as well.<br /><br />Land of the Dead is a pretty good zombie movie.  It's graphic, bloody, and creative in that people turn into zombies and die differently each time.  However, there was actually very little bits showing people turn into zombies, which is a negative.  The story was more about, if a zombie bites you, you have to be killed immediately.  If they would have shown more people turning into brain dead, moaning zombies, it would have appealed to me more.<br /><br />The unusual thing about Land of the Dead is how the zombies actually walk around with a spark of intelligence and continue to act almost human-like.  Maybe that has something to do with bad acting, though.  If you can't moan like a zombie, get off the stage.<br /><br />The film started out slow.  It just didn't start out like a very convincing zombie film.  That all changed about halfway through, when the people were on the run.  This is when the zombie outbreak got incredibly intense.  It's worth a watch.</p></body></html>

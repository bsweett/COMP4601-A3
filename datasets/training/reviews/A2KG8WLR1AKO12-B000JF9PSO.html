<meta name="summary" content="United 93 Reminds Us How Much the Islamic Nihilists Hate Us"></head><body><p>Paul Greengrass's United 93 is a must see film.  It pulls no punches.  The Islamic nihilists are clearly shown to be evil.  The four young men who hijack the flight hate us and everything we stand for.  They are true believers who readily rationalize the brutal slaughter of innocents.  Slashing the throats of the so-called nonbelievers is totally justified in their way of looking at the world.  And no, they are not particularly unique. Millions of Muslims also agree with them.  Do they represent the majority?  There are roughly 1.2 billion believers of Islam residing on this planet.  Even a small percentage of this total is enough to cause great concern.<br /><br />We, of course, already know much of the story before we enter the theater.  The tragic end is not a mystery.  Nonetheless, Greenglass's creation keeps our eyes glued to the screen.  I don't recall even hearing a pin drop.  Around three initially noisy teenagers sat in front of me.  They never uttered a word during the movie.  Needless to add, United 93 is not escapist entertainment.  The passengers are doomed---and they did nothing whatsoever to place themselves in such a predicament.  It was merely the luck of the draw.  Ultimately, a number of the passengers bravely attempt to recapture the plane.  If nothing else, we now know they likely saved our nation's capitol.  I will be blunt.  Do you plan on voting in November?  If so, you are perhaps even morally obligated to view United 93.  The stakes are too high to trust the safety of the American citizenry to elected officials who fail to truly comprehend the threat of the radical Muslims.  Small children should not see United 93.  Anyone over the age of 12, however, should definitely do so.  I plan on purchasing a DVD copy.  United 93 should be seen on at least a yearly basis.  We must never forget what occurred on September 11, 2001.  Sadly, the war on terror is not going away anytime in the near future.<br /><br />David Thomson<br />Flares into Darkness</p></body></html>

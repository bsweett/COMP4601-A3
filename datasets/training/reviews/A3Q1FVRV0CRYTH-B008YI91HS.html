<meta name="summary" content="One of the best!"></head><body><p>'Jurassic Park' is on my list of the best movies to never recieve a 'Best Picture' nod at the oscars.  Now, some of you may not agree, and then some of you may.  I feel that 'Jurassic Park' is still one of the best films to ever grace the big screen.  Adapted (loosly) from Michael Crichton's novel of the same name 'Jurassic Park' delivers a solid script, solid acting and SOLID thrills that can not and will not be repeated (as is proven by the failed attempts in 'The Lost World' and 'Jurassic Park III', both of which are decent but nothing even close to the original)  Before the doors to the Amusement Park to end all Amusement Parks is opened, the owner ushers in a few experts to take one final look.  Amoung these experts is a Mathematician (Goldbloom) and dino-experts/Paleontologists (Dern and Neill).  Of course upon hearing that this park offers guests a chance to see extinct dinosours these experts are a bit (or I should say a lot) skeptical, but after their first glimpse at the finished product they are stunned.  The film quickly turns from awe and wonderment to fear and terror and it does so with smart and effective scenes and dialog, and what works so well here is that not only does it serve up great action and suspence but it also builds up the charactors and gives you a look into these people, creating a three dimentional cast and giving the veiwer a feeling of being there with these people as the try and survive.  One of the most effective thrill rides to date and well deserving of all the praise.  This is the film to beat.</p></body></html>

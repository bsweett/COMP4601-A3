<meta name="summary" content="Kevin Rocks as Darin"></head><body><p>Kevin Spacey had a tremendous admiration for Bobby Darin and it shows in this fast paced story on the musical genius' life.  The pacing needed to be fast since Darin was a man on a mission.  Overcoming the handicap of a rheumatic heart, the clock was always ticking extra fast since he knew that each year he lived defied medical expectations.<br /><br />We hear the great Darin repertoire once more, the hit songs such as the title of the film, his big success "Beyond the Sea" along with the memorable "Mack the Knife", "Splish Splash" and so many others.  He moved fast from his New York City roots and dreams of playing The Copacabana in the manner of Hoboken, New Jersey's idol, and also Italian song master Frank Sinatra.  Darin soon realized the Copa ambition.  From there it was on to wowing them in Las Vegas, also in the manner of the great Sinatra.<br /><br />Spacey interacts well with Patricia Bosworth, who plays the part of his beautiful blonde actress wife Sandra Dee.  The facts are accurate concerning how they connected, in the dramatic atmosphere of Italy, the land of Bobby's roots.  He pursued Dee intensely, having to overcome her determined stage mother to secure her hand in marriage.  They were there to perform in the Universal film "Come September" starring Rock Hudson and Gina Lollabrigida.<br /><br />In addition to cataloguing Dee's success in popular youth films as Gidget and Tammy we also see Darin's triumph as he is nominated for Best Supporting Actor in Universal's "Captain Newman" starring Gregory Peck, Tony Curtis and Angie Dickinson.  He is revealed as a competitive man who hated to lose at anything, as evidenced by his reaction to losing the Oscar to Melvyn Douglas, who appeared in "Hud" with Paul Newman and Patricia Neal.<br /><br />Another important element of Darin's life and career was his peace activism and role in the campaign of his friend, the man he admired so greatly, Senator Robert Kennedy.  One of the film's most touching scenes is his reaction to Kennedy's assassination after his victory in the California presidential primary.<br /><br />We cannot help but admire Darin's courage at the end of his life when, after open heart surgery, with the knowledge he does not have long to live, he defies the odds to the end as he continues performing.  Here was a man who would not be separated from his music, no matter how great the obstacles.</p></body></html>

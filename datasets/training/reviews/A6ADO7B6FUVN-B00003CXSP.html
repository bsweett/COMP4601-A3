This opens up a new opportunity to catch Dr. Lecter for those who seek to catch him.  Hannibal is a suspenseful thriller with some gruesome scenes that will remind the audience of Hannibal's psychological state long after they have seen the film.  In addition, Hopkins offers a solid performance as Hannibal once again, but this sequel does not measure up with the original Silence of the Lambs.</p></body></html>

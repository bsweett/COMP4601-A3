<meta name="summary" content="Howling Great Film"></head><body><p>What a pleasant surprise!<br /><br />This is an exceptionally handsome big budget remaking of "The Wolfman" with an A-list cast, set in the late nineteenth century.<br /><br />The costumes and settings are spectacular, the effects are nifty, and the man/werewolf transformations are state-of-the-art.<br /><br />Connoisseurs will appreciate the fact that Rick Baker apparently masterminded the makeup effects.<br /><br />Bloody, scary, and exciting, this is a true horror film, in which a tragic protagonist is undone by his fate and ultimately delivered from damnation by the love of a good woman.<br /><br />The only reason I give this DVD four stars instead of five is the appalling lack of extras, which apparently have been reserved for the Blu Ray version.  This is NOT acceptable!!!  Studios should NOT penalize DVD viewers with such sleazy and greedy marketing tactics.<br /><br />Back to the film, this is a must-see for any fans of the classic Universal horror films.  Maybe it's time for a superior remake of "Frankenstein" and "The Bride of Frankenstein"!<br /><br />But is this DVD a must-own?  NOT until they add the making-of extras that appear on the BR version.  Humbug -- silver bullets are too good for the Universal marketers who have shortchanged DVD viewers here!</p></body></html>

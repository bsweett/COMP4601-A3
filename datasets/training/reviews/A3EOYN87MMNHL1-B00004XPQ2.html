Sir Alec Guiness is a standout, as is the Japanese commander.  The tension builds artfully throughout the duration of the movie as cruelties escalate and the prisoners try to outsmart their captors.  Perserverence is the name of the game and William Holden perserveres and injects his own dramatic style into the bargaining.  We finally get the pay off and it is a doozie.  BOTRK deserves all of its academy awards and more.</p></body></html>

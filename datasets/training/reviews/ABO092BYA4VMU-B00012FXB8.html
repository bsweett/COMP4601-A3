<meta name="summary" content="New footage of Alien 3 described below"></head><body><p>I give the theatrical release 3 stars, the more violent, profane and much more different special edition 3 1/2 stars and the DVD 5 stars! About 40 minutes was added into the movie, and they are described below:<br /><br />Chapter 3: One Survivor?<br /><br />This alternate scene is the reason why this version is so much different from the theatrical release. Since this scene was cut and replaced, Chapters 8 and 9 were also cut and replaced (only Chapter 9 was replaced)This is the orginial, alternate version of the prisoners discovering Ripley, Hicks, Newt and Bishop.<br /><br />Chapter 4: The Facts<br /><br />This extended scene shows Dillon praying with the prisoners.<br /><br />Chapter 7: A Possible Contagion<br /><br />This extended scene has addtional dialogue between Ripley and Clemens.<br /><br />Chapter 8: What Killed Babe?<br /><br />It's so obvious why this scene was cut: because the orginial, alternate version of the finding of Ripley, Hicks, Newt and Bishop was cut, too. Another reason why this was cut was because in the theatrical version, a facehugger attached itself to a dog. But, the special edition, you saw an ox, something you never saw in the theatrical release. This scene shows Murphy and Frank dragging a dead ox and talking about having sex with Ripley. Then, Murphy discovers the facehugger attached to the ox's face.<br /><br />Chapter 9: A New Beginning<br /><br />This alternate scene shows the Alien bursting out of the dead ox. In the theatrical release, the Alien bursts out of a living dog.<br /><br />Chapter 10: Disharmony<br /><br />This new scene shows Dillon handling the situation with Boggs and Rains about their dislike with Golic.<br /><br />Chapter 11: New Temptations<br /><br />This extended scene shows Dillon telling Ripley about their religion.<br /><br />Chapter 12: Attracted In That Way<br /><br />This extended scene has additional dialogue between Ripley and Clemens.<br /><br />Chapter 13: Diced<br /><br />This extended scene shows Ripley and Clemens talking more after sex and Murphy's graphic death.<br /><br />Chapter 14: The Flight Recorder<br /><br />This extended scene shows the prisoners going through the bowels of the refinery complex.<br /><br />Chapter 15: High Priority<br /><br />This extended scene has additonal dialogue between Clemens and Superintendent Andrews.<br /><br />Chapter 18: Bishop Speaks<br /><br />This extended scene shows a prisoner finding Golic and then, Dillon and other prisoners grabbing him.<br /><br />Chapter 20: A Long, Sad Story<br /><br />This extended/alternate scene begins with a different angle of Ripley asking Clemens if there is a way to escape.<br /><br />Chapter 21: "It's Here!"<br /><br />This is the uncut version of Clemens's horryfing and graphic death, with more footage of the Alien and Clemens being brutally killed. It also shows Dillon praying with the prisoners and then cussing at everyone.<br /><br />Chapter 22: Who's in Charge?<br /><br />This extended scene shows Aaron cleaning up the bloody mess that the Alien caused when it killed Andrews. There is also additional dialogue.<br /><br />Chapter 24: Preparations<br /><br />This extended scene shows more footage of the prisoners preparing their trap for the Alien.<br /><br />Chapter 25: Wait for the Signal<br /><br />This extended scene shows more killing of the prisoners when the trap misfires. Then, Junior, a prisoner who tried to rape Ripley earlier, heroically sacrifices himself to the Alien so the prisoners can trap the Alien.<br /><br />Chapter 26: They Don't Want To Kill It<br /><br />This new scene shows Aaron and Ripley talking about killing the Alien.<br /><br />Chapter 27: Cut Loose<br /><br />This new scene shows Golic begging Morse to set him free, and he finally does, then Golic hits Morse over the head unconcsious.<br /><br />Chapter 28: Permission Denied<br /><br />This new scene shows Ripley requesting permission from the company to terminate the Alien and they say "no".<br /><br />Chapter 29:<br /><br />This extended/alternate scene shows the deranged Golic going to where the Alien is, and he slits the guard's throat, opens the door and is instantly killed by the Alien.<br /><br />Chapter 31: Better Get Prepared<br /><br />This new scene shows Dillon and the prisoners having a meeting.<br /><br />Chapter 32: A Classified Code<br /><br />Ripley tells Aaron that the Alien won't kill her.<br /><br />Chapter 33:<br /><br />This extended scene shows more dialogue between Ripley and Dillon.<br /><br />Chapter 35: Plan B<br /><br />This extended/alternate scene has additonal dialogue by Ripley and the prisoners.<br /><br />Chapter 36: One Chance<br /><br />This alternate scene is the alternate version of the prisoners waiting for the plan to start.<br /><br />Chapter 37: It Started<br /><br />This extended scene shows a prisoner finding a bloody mess of another prisoner.<br /><br />Chapter 38: Improvising<br /><br />This extended scene shows Dillon telling Ripley that they are "Improvising".<br /><br />Chapter 42: Never Trust a Bishop<br /><br />This extended scene has additional dialogue between Bishop II and Ripley.<br /><br />Chapter 43: Ripley's Choice<br /><br />This extended/alternate scene shows Ripley hesitating for a moment before she falls. And, a different shot of Ripley falling into the lava, without the Alien Queen bursting out of her.<br /><br />The Special Edition is more violent and profane, yet it makes more sense because an Alien that size could NEVER burst out of a dog, but it could burst out of an ox.</p></body></html>

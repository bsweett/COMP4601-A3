<meta name="summary" content="A Whole Lotta Nothin'"></head><body><p>Zach Braff, tired of being lively and appealing on Scrubs, decided to do a 180 in his first (and hopefully last) feature film, where an emotionally stunted waiter (who's an aspiring actor) goes home after news that his mother has died; and here we follow the exciti-mind numbingly dull adventures of a narcissistic whiner who's unhappy (cue the violin).<br /><br />Here's a summary of Zach Braff's emotional range in Garden State: =I. Actually I think that emoticon had a little more range to it but basically Zach Braff looks bored or high or something throughout his movie. The hip fanboys will probably argue that the reason Zach Braff doesn't emote much is because he doesn't know how to express himself but unless you count dressing up in garbage bags and yelling into a hole, Zach Braff never shows any emotion or revelation or whatever the movie was going for, and it seems like an excuse for him to smoke a joint or whatever during the shooting (and probably pushing his crappy music on Natalie Portman).<br /><br />In fact it's not just Zach Braff's lack of acting, the whole movie just reeks of laziness. The set designs are boring and uninteresting, the directing is bland and completely uninspired, and the writing is typical indie garbage about *slightly* dysfunctional people doing *quirky* things like crying over a pet cemetary or wearing a shirt that matches the wall; wow, that's so deep/clever/original Zach Braff, anything else to say in your bloated turd of a movie besides 'let the little stuff go'? No? Wow, it's like a 2 hour fortune cookie, how deep man.<br /><br />I think I'd rather watch Scrubs: Interns Edition that this movie again. At least Zach Braff can use his facial muscles there.</p></body></html>

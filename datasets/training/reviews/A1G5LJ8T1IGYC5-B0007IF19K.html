<meta name="summary" content="BEST FILM OF 2004: 4.5 STARS"></head><body><p>THE LIFE AND TIMES OF THE LEGENDARY RAY CHARLES [PLAYED EXCEPTIONALLY WELL BY JAMIE FOXX] ARE EXPLORED IN THIS NEAR-CLASSIC FILM. ACTING IS STRONG, THE STORY OF RAY'S LIFE IS PRESENTED EXTREMELY WELL, AND THE MOVIE IS ENJOYABLE AS WELL AS INSPIRATIONAL. THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS ME FROM GIVING THIS OTHERWISE EXCELLENT PIECE OF FILM 5 STARS IS THE FACT THAT IT'S JUST A TAD BIT TOO LONG. BUT, JAMIE FOXX'S MESMERISING PERFORMANCE AS RAY CHARLES MORE THAN MAKES UP FOR THAT. THE WAY JAMIE FOXX PLAYS RAY CHARLES IN THIS MOVIE IS FRIGHTENINGLY AMAZING, LIKE THE WAY ROBERT DE NIRO PLAYED JAKE LAMOTTA IN ''RAGING BULL''. IF ANY MOVIE SHOWS THE POTENTIAL JAMIE FOXX HAS DEVELOPED AS AN ACTOR, IT'S GOTTA BE THIS ONE. I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY SAYS, THIS MOVIE DESERVES AN OSCAR FOR BEST PICTURE AND JAMIE FOXX DESERVES AN OSCAR FOR BEST ACTOR. AND IF THIS MOVIE DOESN'T WIN ANY OSCARS, THEN DAMMIT, THE JUDGES AT THE OSCARS WOULD BE LYING TO THEMSELVES IF THEY CHOSE ANY OTHER FILM OVER THIS FOR BEST PICTURE OR ANY OTHER ACTOR OVER JAMIE FOXX FOR BEST ACTOR. BUT, IF THIS MOVIE DOESN'T WIN ANY OSCARS, YOU KNOW THE REASON WHY. AND IT'D BE AN EXTREMELY BIG SHAME TOO. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE BS MOVIES THAT PLAGUE THE MOVIE THEATRES NOWADAYS, FEEL FREE TO RENT OR BUY THIS. YOU WON'T REGRET IT. EVEN PEOPLE WHO DON'T LISTEN TO RAY CHARLES' MUSIC WILL EASILY COME TO LIKE THIS MOVIE. A TRUE GEM.</p></body></html>

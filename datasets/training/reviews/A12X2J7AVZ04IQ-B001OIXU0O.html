Being somewhat of a film aficianado, I've come to believe that Meryl Streep is among the finest of actresses...ever. I had to check out her musical romp, and I wasn't disappointed. Everyone knows she has a great voice (Postcards from the Edge, Ironweed) and I'm surprised she hasn't been used in other musical endeavors. Regardless, I enjoyed "Mamma Mia!" a lot; a sweet love story centering around middle'aged types. How refreshing. I was entertained a lot, and if you weren't, maybe you should lighten up a bit. I enjoyed the entire cast of old pros, and also the lovely Amanda Seyfried as the catalyst of all the silliness that ensues. It's so silly, but I applaud the film for its unrelenting energy. Kick back, have popcorn and beverages of choice, and enjoy this attempt to bring back the exhuberant musical style that hasn't been successful since "Grease" (1978) or "Hair" (1979). Meryl Streep really shines, once again.</p></body></html>

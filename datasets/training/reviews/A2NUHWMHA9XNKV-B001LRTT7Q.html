<meta name="summary" content="This movie was good!"></head><body><p>This one was really good. I saw a side of Ben Foster I'd never seen. It was full of suspense and I kept watching. Bruce Willis was really good in here. The whole movie was good.The plot had a little bit of parts that were left out, but if you would come in on the middle of the movie, you would watch it till the end.</p></body></html>

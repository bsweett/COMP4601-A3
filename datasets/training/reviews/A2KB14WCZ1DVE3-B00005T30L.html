I thought this was going to be another "Daria", the "Beavis and Butthead" spinoff.  In that cartoon, the character Daria has a lot of good cynical observations about other people, but in the end, Daria really doesn't have anything of her own to offer, so it ends up as whining.  <p>Which is where I thought this one was going.  You have a couple of very intelligent recent high school graduates that, we are led to believe, participated in absolutely nothing in their four years, mostly because it was beneath them.  They are snobs about just about anything except themselves, but like Daria, contribute virtually nothing to make them interesting on their own.  <p>But this turns out to be just character establishment, and if you give the movie a chance, you see how life continues to chip away at the suits of armor the girls wear against the world. The blonde, Scarlett Johansson, cracks first.  She lowers herself to actually get a job, and even though she still agrees that most of her customers are idiots, she starts to see that, well, that's what people are.  And like it or not, you still have to exist with others to some degree.  <p>The unrecognizable, but still brilliant Thora Birch holds out a lot longer.  She makes almost no attempt to get a job, and with the one she gets, she refuses to play the game.  When she first meets the Steve Buscemi character, it's to humiliate him, then try to help what she sees as a total loser.  In her world, practically everyone is a loser, but if they are a big enough loser, this makes them cool to some degree, and worthy of attention.  There is a lot of mental work to be done when one has this personality.  <p>Besides the slow unraveling of the girls' shields, the movie is also great by not having a neatly wrapped up ending, either happy or sad.  Enid (Birch) finds that because she's bothered when people reject her, this must mean that she actually must care for these people, and therefore, must have feelings.  We don't see any clear direction of where she's going, but we do see an awakening.  She will probably never totally play the game, but with seven billion people in the world, there might be more than one that are worth associating with.</p></body></html>

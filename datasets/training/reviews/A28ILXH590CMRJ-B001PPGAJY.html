<meta name="summary" content="X-2 is a superior sequel"></head><body><p>With the huge success of X-MEN, it was only natural that a sequel would eventually follow. Indeed, X-MEN proved to be the harbinger of the current trend of high budget superhero films based on the Marvel comics.  X-MEN UNITED is that rare sequel that both builds and improves upon what has gone on before in the first film.  Basically picking up where the original left off, things get off to a rollicking start when a strange blue-skinned mutant attempts to assassinate the President.  Later, it turns out that government agent William Stryker (Bryan Cox) is behind the attack in order to further a plot to destroy all mutants.  As a result, the heroic X-Men must join forces with old foe Magneto (Ian McKellen) to stop Stryker's plans.<p>Like any sequel should be, X2 is a bigger, better, and more fun film than the original.  With much of the set-up already taken care of, the film starts off quickly and never lets go.  Most of the original cast reprise their roles and they never miss a beat. Hugh Jackman leads the way as the surly Wolverine, remaining a solid focus for the audience to identify with.  Patrick Stewart's Professor X and McKellen's Magneto again provide the film's philosophical center with their solid performances.  Compared to the last film, Halle Berry actually gets more to do as weather-witch Storm and she makes the most of it with some touching moments.  Famke Janssen also scores effectively in the pivotal role of Dr. Jean Grey.  As the "new mutant on the block," Alan Cumming adds both humor and warmth as the blue-skinned Nightcrawler.  Bryan Cox brings both pathos and menace as the nasty Stryker, while Kelly Hu brings the right touch of darkness as Stryker's aide, Lady Deathstrike.  Director Brian Singer directs with a sure hand, while creating a coherent story despite the rather large amount of characters.  <p>With its intelligent story, solid cast, and riveting action, X-2: X-MEN UNITED succeeds where many comic films tend to fail, which makes this a film well worth recommending to fan and non-fan alike.</p></body></html>

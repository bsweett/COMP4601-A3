<meta name="summary" content="Watchmen (Director's Cut + BD-Live) [Blu-ray]"></head><body><p>In a gritty and alternate 1985 the glory days of costumed vigilantes have been brought to a close by a government crackdown, but after one of the masked veterans is brutally murdered an investigation into the killer is initiated. The reunited heroes set out to prevent their own destruction, but in doing so discover a deeper and far more diabolical plot. The superpowers of the graphic novel are weakened, but Watchmen still packs a wallop. This movie brings the superhero-noir murder mystery very much to life.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Delightful Medley Of Love Stories -Terrific Ensemble Cast!"></head><body><p>&quot;Love Actually&quot; is a delightful medley of seemingly unconnected love stories which come beautifully together in the end. This ensemble comedy features some of my favorite actors, and they all seem to be in top form in this feel good film which features &quot;love&quot; - romantic, platonic, unrequited, fulfilled, unspoken, impossible and even filial.<br /><br /> Colin Firth is fantastic and sexy as the cuckolded husband who runs off to France to escape his sorrows, and discovers a cure for a broken heart. Hugh Grant is a riot as England's bachelor Prime Minister whose mind wanders every time the teagirl enters his office. His middle-aged sister, played by Emma Thompson, is fearful her husband, (Alan Rickman), is having an affair with his vamp of a secretary. Laura Linney is a lovelorn employee of Rickman's, who just can't get it together to make a commitment. Liam Neeson is struggling to get a grip after the recent death of his wife and finds himself distracted by his delightful stepson's shenanigans. Bill Nighy is hilarious as an over-the-hill rock star who is re-releasing a song for the Christmas season and hopes it will hit Number One on the charts.<br /><br /> Director Richard Curtis, (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones' Diary), is an expert at putting together this kind of movie and he is certainly at his best with &quot;Love Actually.&quot; I held off seeing this film while it was in the theaters, and even after it hit Blockbuster. I was fearful I would expire from an overdose of fluff and saccharine. I finally broke down...and, what a surprise! I really liked it - a lot!!<br /><br /> This film is set at Christmas time but it brings great cheer no matter what the season.<br /><br /> JANA</p></body></html>

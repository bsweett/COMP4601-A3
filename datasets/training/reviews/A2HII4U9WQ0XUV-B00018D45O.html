What else is there to say?<br /><br />First-time director Marcus Nispel (who had previously done nothing but music videos)answer that question in his sledgehammer remake, and the answer to the question is: Oh, old hoss---there's always plenty to say about primal fear.<br /><br />The subject is Fear. Fear, not just of death, but what comes before, and perhaps a little after.<br /><br />We've all been caught out on some lonesome highway after dark, trying to peer up over the high beams at the unfamiliar road up ahead, desperate for a place to pull over for the night, disappointed when the green relflectorized sign drawing up from the dark turns out to be a mile marker and not an advance beacon for the next town.<br /><br />You're afraid of drifting off the road; you're afraid you should have pulled over at that truck-stop 100 miles back and gotten some coffee. You're afraid of all that dark piled up outside the windshield if you're alone, and if you're not, then you're afraid of the horrors that could swoop down on your sweetie, sleeping comfortably in back, if something happens to you.<br /><br />Then you see the red & blue flashers in your rear-view. How could you miss 'em, since the trooper has what must be 30 krieg lights also trained on your head. Is there any Bad Feeling in the world so convulsively bad as being pulled over, out of the blue, by a nameless trooper on a nameless stretch of forlorn roadway at a nameless hour?<br /><br />Especially when, after you've fumbled over your license & registration, said trooper says, in an inflectionless monotone, "could you step out of the car, please?". As if it's an invitation.<br /><br />That is Fear, is it not? You're told to get out of the car by an AUTHORITY: normally you'd be ready to kill---we're wired that way---but what if this guy is legit? Then aren't you the bad guy?<br /><br />Nispel takes that concept and nails it like a champ in his "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", less a 'remake' than a variation on the good old bloody theme. Who knew a whiskey-drenched, speech-slurring redneck sheriff (R. Lee Ermey, who owns the flick right down to his ugly black sock garters) could be more frightening than a chainsaw-wielding monster(Andy Bryniarski, hulking and menacing very nicely, thank you) who wears the skinned faces of his victims?<br /><br />Now, all the original ingredients in this Texas BBQ (extra bloody!--erm, hearty!) recipe are still there, even John Larroquette's solemn voice-over, which still gives me laughing spasms every time I hear it.<br /><br />You've got five teenagers (Jessica Biel and Ericha Leerhsen provide the ogle factor, while Mike Vogel does all the heavy lifting and the other two guys are white noise) crammed in a van on a roadtrip through 1970's Southeast Texas, five teenagers bearing gifts of frankincense, Lynyrd Skynyrd tickets, and pot. Yeah, they're heading north to the Skynyrd concert, ya know man, having scored a little sweet Mary Jane down Mexico way.<br /><br />Which means a quick stop for Texas BBQ and some gas is fraught with more than a little anxiety, and a little becomes a lot when the Kids meet up with a pretty, distraught young hitchhiker (Lauren German), who gives a whole new meaning to "concealed weapon". Soon the Kids needs help from the Locals, and the Locals---well, you know, they need help from the Kids too, so to speak.<br /><br />That's about all you need to know. If you haven't seen either film, I envy you; if you've seen the Hooper classic, then you're in for a few nasty surprises. Nispell keeps the pacing taut, and stables TCM with some remarkably solid actors. Ermey (Sheriff Hoyt) can act in his sleep, but here he achieves a remarkable transformation: keep a close eye on his facial mannerisms.<br /><br />Mike Vogel (Andy)is equally remarkable here: it's rare that I pay attention to victims (I'm rooting for the dude with the Chainsaw, myself), but he does a brand of scared sh*tless I haven't seen before. Impressive, Vogel---very impressive. Leatherface Bryniarski doesn't disgrace the blade: the "custom" face was a sick little touch (you'll know it when you see it).<br /><br />And then, of course, we have the townies: Terrence Evans (Old Monty)serves up a nice turn on the wheelchair-guy motif of the original (brrrr); Heather Kafka (Henrietta) goes from reticent to psycho in less time than you can say "Armadillo!"; and Kathy Lamkin (Tea Lady, and a stand-in for Fat Mama from "Gilbert Grape"), who goes "my my my my my" and gives me the crawls. Yeesh.<br /><br />Nispel's cinematography (vet Daniel Pearl wields the camera) lacks the raw, grainy, documentary flavor of the original (that was called *no* budget), but manages to look both sleek and dangerous. Best of all are the locations, which are even more forlorn than those in the original Massacre. All convey isolation, degeneracy, rot: an entire region whose livelihood, and morality, have long ago gone to seed.<br /><br />Jim Morrison once said, "Out here on the Perimeter there are no Stars". The Perimeter the Old Dead Lizard King was referring to wasn't the Frontier---I think it was the Forgotten. The Land that has been drained and bypassed. Out here, city boy, we have our own ways, and our ways ain't your ways. Out here, we just might bury strangers.<br /><br />Out here on the Perimeter, "civilized" means something else: maybe it means giving strangers a wide berth. Or maybe it means teeth and flesh and blood and the whine of a chainsaw in the dark.<br /><br />Eat up.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

Borrowing liberally from Day of the Triffids, Night of the Comet [remember that one?] and Omega Man, this erstwhile zombie-ish flick takes place in England and surrounding parts.  When radical do-gooder animal rights activists release test monkeys full of `rage' potion they do more harm than good as usual.  The virus quickly infects everything and turns humans into slavering, red-eyed rage-a-holics.  The token survivor, a bicycle courier, wakes up in a hospital and wanders around the desolate London before things start getting better.  Chased by mobs of the infected he joins up with a few more survivors as they make their way to the requisite military stronghold.  Once there, of course, we see the soldiers have already started breaking down in Lord of the Flies fashion, and boy are they happy to have some chicks show up.  Cinematically impressive, with some gritty effects and angles it's a slightly above average entry into this genre which I'll revisit when the new Dawn of the Dead comes out.</p></body></html>

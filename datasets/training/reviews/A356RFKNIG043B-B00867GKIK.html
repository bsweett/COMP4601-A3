Surprisingly sad at various points, this is an amazingly emotional film, which somehow feels funny, in a good way.<br /><br />After seeing this in 3D in a theatre, I think the blu-ray is better. The 3D still felt like an effect; the blu-ray through hdmi on a decent flat screen is astonishing. The colors on Kevin the "snipe" were easily the deepest vermillion, most translucent purple, and so on, that I have yet to see on our LCD screen. Incredible, and a pleasure just on its own.<br /><br />Add a perfect script, flawless animation with especially natural lighting effects, and an overall patina of unstinting quality, and Pixar has made an animated feature that will wear as well as any film of any sort. The retro feel is integral to its charm, and the whole story feels timeless. I really can't think of anything I don't like about Up. Even the sad bits feel authentic, not Disney fake.<br /><br />The various extras are excellent, especially the short that preceeded Up in theatres, and the fascinating documentary about Tepui, the original Paradise Falls area in Venezuela. The folks who made this film seem very sweet and very smart, and that sums up Up.<br /><br />Can't recommend this one highly enough.</p></body></html>

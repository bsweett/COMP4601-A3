<meta name="summary" content="IN A WORD:  UNIQUE"></head><body><p>This movie is visually stunning, and i found the story to be unique and more than a little bit disturbing.  Be forewarned, it is shockingly violent.  I liked to way the screenplay occilates between fantasy and reality, it gives the movie a real edge.  The movie sort of reminded me of the Tom Cruise film, Legend, though this film is much better.  This film has gotten fantastic reviews, which in some ways is well deserved, but i was not blown away, I just thought, wow, what an origial idea and i appreciated the execution.  I do recommend it, but do prepare yourself for some graphic violence.</p></body></html>

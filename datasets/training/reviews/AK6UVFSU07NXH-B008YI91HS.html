<meta name="summary" content="A movie with bite."></head><body><p>Written by Michael Crichton, Jurassic Park is one of the big budget special effect jobs that the critics love to bag. So what! It's awe inspiring. The cinematography is nothing short of perfect.  The effects are  seamless and the action is heart stopping. On the less than brilliant side,  the characters were mainly two dimensional. Specifically, the lawyer was a  joke, (intentional but unnecessary). I just wish that the game warden's  character had been explored a little more.<br /><br />The plot is  straightforward. We have a scientific breakthrough that brings the  dinosaurs back to life after a much touted 65 million year absence.  Strangely, instead of scientific motivation, it has been created for  financial reasons. (-: A game park to be precise. But before it opens, the  backers want a run through with some experts, (and a couple of cute kids),  in order to check for safety.  It may well have been safe, except that the  one man programming company that set up the systems, (who by the way should  get the programming god of the century award), is selling out to the  baddies who want some dino-embryos.<br /><br />The next thing you know, T-rex  has escaped and is snacking on lawyers and the rest of the good guys are  battling it out against a pack of vicious Velociraptors. Lots of tension  and suspense here. But don't worry it is a Hollywood movie and therefore  gets a happy ending. Look out for the sequel, which if Crichton's novel is  any guide, will be a &quot;me too&quot; version of the first movie. Never  mind, the first one was good enough for two.</p></body></html>

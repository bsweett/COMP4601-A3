<meta name="summary" content="Strong performances and story; why so overlooked?"></head><body><p>I don't remember this one getting that much attention at Oscar time.  Maybe my memory is incorrect, but it seems to me that there should have been some nominations here for Finney, Hoffman and possibly Hawke.  Their performances were as strong and emotional as any that were given last year.  Hoffman's meltdown in his car with his wife beside him, after a funeral, hits you right in the gut.<br /><br />Perhaps it's the small scale, intimate nature of the film that kept audiences away.  It's not a sweeping gangster epic with "stars" in it; instead, it's a poignant, painful, wrenching story of two brothers who need money so desperately that they decide to steal from their own parents.  They try to rationalize it--no one is supposed to get hurt, the business is insured, etc.--but as is often the case, the robbery goes horribly and tragically wrong and they must deal with repercussions and damages they had never anticipated.<br /><br />What's especially interesting is the director's narrative style here, going back and forth from the days before the robbery to the day it occurs to the days afterwards; and the revisiting and expanding on certain scenes from different angles and from different characters' perspectives.  It is done in such a way that it is not at all confusing for the viewer.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Revenge Epic True to Era"></head><body><p>"The Gangs of New York" is Director Martin Scorsee's epic on New York City's mid-1800's gangs.  The cinema and sets for the timeframe are amazing and Daniel Day-Lewis is perfect in his role as the Bill the Butcher.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon who is a son of a well respected gang leader.  He sees Bill the Butcher kill his father.  Amsterdam, now fully grown, wants to get revenge against the Butcher for his father's death. The movie shows how Amsterdam gradually works his way into Bill the Butcher's group and eventually earns his trust and respect.  Amsterdam also meets and has to deal with the beautiful Jenny Everdean (Cameron Diaz) during his quest.  It seems like this is more of a chore than love most of the time, although Jenny is a beauty.<br /><br />The cinematography and historical sets of New York were amazing.  The movie was good, but overall could have been smoother in connecting the scenes.  The chemistry between DiCaprio and Diaz was not there.  The Gangs of New York is a solid "good" - but could have been fantastic if the editing hadn't created a somewhat choppy story.</p></body></html>

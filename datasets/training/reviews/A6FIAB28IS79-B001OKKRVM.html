<meta name="summary" content="Should you pray for a baby penguin?"></head><body><p>[Sorry to offend people with my review.  I know people who readily say penguins and cute puppies were created by God whereas snakes, spiders, and the HIV virus were created by some demonic force.  It's this sort of selective, anthropomorphic, myopic and reductive thinking that is taking us backward as a nation.  "God" (as opposed to "my" God, which immediately gives away the naive faith of the thoughtless "believer") is not so limited that that he/she answers only to the selfish wishes of a few. Termites are no less part of the Creator's business than cute little bunnies.  Christians and Muslims worship the same God of Abraham.  God does not play favorites, does not favor any particular flag, not to mention political party, over another.]<br /><br /> The "family values" politicians who, of late, have had so much difficulty practicing what they preach, would certainly have no more perfect model of the self-sacrificial monogamy they promote than "March of the Penguins."  But during the grueling 9 months of each year during which these noble, dignified creatures starve themselves, march endlessly, endure "terrorists" in the form of predators at every turn, they do not appear to have God on their side.  Misfortune and, as Morgan Freeman puts it, "unbearable grief," are a constant threat and reality.  Is it a moral failing that accounts for such seeming injustices and hardships to their ranks?  Is it because they lack a "personal relationship with Jesus" (to borrow a trendy phrase these days)?  Or are we seeing a more accurate mirror of the human condition than, save for Darwinians, humans are reluctant to accept?<br /><br />"March of the Penguins" is definitely manipulative, but the amazing shots that the film has provided (I'd hate to even conjecture the percentage of raw footage to actually used, edited footage in the film) are sufficient to enable the viewer to forgive the "anthropomorphic indulgences and excesses" of the story of these creatures, who are made to seem larger and more "human" than they are.  It's a movie that is part science, part "pathetic fallacy" (a term that literary teachers use for the human emotions that poets are prone to ascribe to non-human creatures).<br /><br />It's a film that leaves (quite intentionally) many questions unanswered, but its intentions are good.  It raises awareness and provokes questions about creation, nature, and humans' place in the scheme of things.  Moreover, the parallels between penguin and human relationships are undeniable, even if the "feelings" are necessarily projections of the spectators.  Any productive steps toward atoning for our own violations of natural laws--such as righting pollution and global warming--are likely to come about only if we can "feel" our inseparable relationship with nature, coming to the realization that besides being spiritual and material beings, we are indeed natural ones.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="My #1 movie of the year!"></head><body><p>First off, any movie that has Marisa Tomei naked in three different scenes automatically gets four stars. However, this movie is even better than that! It's incredible that the guy who made movies like '12 Angry Men', 'Serpico', 'Dog Day Afternoon', 'Network' and 'The Verdict', can actually come out with one of his best at age 83. This is a great crime drama about a heist where everything goes wrong. But it's not really a heist movie, that's just the outline for the in-depth character studies. Philip Seymour Hoffman is his usual amazing self, Ethan Hawke matches him as his brother; Marisa Tomei is hotter than ever (did I mention that she gets naked? three times?), and does a good job playing Hoffman's depressive wife. Albert Finney is Oscar-worthy as their father, and there's even a small role for Amy Ryan, who shined in the movie I watched the previous evening, 'Gone Baby Gone'. One of Sidney Lumet's best movies, and that's really saying something.</p></body></html>

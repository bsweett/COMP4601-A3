<meta name="summary" content="Murray carries this film all the way to the finish line..."></head><body><p>I happen to find Bill Murray utterly hysterical, when he's in the right movie.  If he is not in the right film I find him excruciating.  While I can't say that `Groundhog Day' is a completely realized concept (there was so much more that could have been done here) I can honestly say that Murray's transformation as Phil Connors is a completely realized performance.  He is quite possibly at his very best here (his `Lost in Translation' stint is still his finest work to date) and evokes enough human feeling to make Phil a very real, a very relatable and in the end a very honest portrait of the average American male.<br /><br />The film focuses on Phil, a weatherman for a Pittsburgh news station who has to travel to Punxatawney to cover Groundhog Day, when Punxatawney Phil comes out to see his shadow.  Phil is a cynical mess who loathes his life and his stagnant attitude towards those around him makes him somewhat of a bother.  No one wants him around and he doesn't really want anyone else around either.  When Phil, his producer Rita and their cameraman Larry find themselves trapped in Punxatawney during a blizzard it seems as though their trip couldn't get any worse, but for Phil it was just about to hit the fan.  Phil wakes up the next morning to find out that it is yesterday, Groundhog Day, yet again.<br /><br />Talk about Deja vu.<br /><br />What's worse is that the next morning it happens again; and again and again.  So what would you do if you could relive the same day over and over without any consequences or repercussions.  Phil at first begins to use it for his own selfish gain (learning about pretty women so as to seduce them) which only leads to his own self hatred and thus moves him to attempt unsuccessful suicides; but when Phil finally realizes that this could all serve to make him a better more fulfilled person things start to change and the cynical mess he used to be begins to strip itself away to reveal a kinder more human side to him.<br /><br />Really, `Groundhog Day' is about taking advantage of the chances we have for self improvement.  There are two types of selfishness; the malicious and self-congratulating kind that only leads to hurt feelings and loneliness; and then there is the kind that leads to self betterment and awareness.  Phil learns to differentiate between the two, becoming selfish for his own good; learning to love himself and thus become a better more fulfilled human being.<br /><br />Murray is phenomenal here, and he needs to be since he is in every scene practically and this he carries this entire film.  His comedic timing is priceless, but it is the warmth he brings to his character; the tragic realism he gives Phil that makes his so much more relatable.  I wish they had cast someone other than Andie MacDowell though.  I find her dreadfully boring most times, and here she fails to really make Rita someone we would fall in love with.  She pretty much plays the same character she did in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' except we see much more of her here, which strips away the mystery that surrounded her equally boring yet much more intriguing character in `Four Weddings' and leaves us with a dreadfully uninteresting creation.<br /><br />I do wish that this film had taken a different direction as far as genre is concerned, because it has all the makings for an intelligent adult character study, along the lines of say `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' or even Murray's own `Lost in Translation'; but instead, targeting a younger audience, the film winds up feeling like a standard comedy a lot of the time, which takes away from the promise of the premise.  It isn't a bad film AT ALL, but there is potential here for a much deeper and much more meaningful film.  Regardless, it is still a film to see, and Murray gives an Oscar worthy performance as the man we all may end up being if we don't learn now how to find fulfillment.</p></body></html>

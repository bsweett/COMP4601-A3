<meta name="summary" content="The "Cleopatra" of Oliver Stone's career"></head><body><p>Oliver Stone's "Alexander" is one long, messy picture. Half of the scenes work, half don't, no two people would probably agree on which, and that's not  to say it's unwatchable. It's a $150 millon bloated epic, with passion and philosophy "Troy" and "Gladiator" never attended to. Stone quite clearly aimed for a modern "Lawrence of Arabia." He failed. But it's a worthy error.<br /><br />Alexander The Great, the Macedonian/Greek conquerer, took kingship after the murder of his father Philip, claimed all of Persia at 25, ruled in the hanging gardens of Babylon, and stretched his empire 10,000 milles to India. He never lost a military battle. He was most likely poisoned by some of his closest advisors who had been denied their return home after seven years and 50 small wars. He died at 32.<br /><br />The outline is important because, for one, Stone employs a narrator in Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) to tell us these things, and he has to fill in the rest of the blanks and dramatize certain relationships, such as that between the adult Alexander (Colin Ferrell) and his mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie), who claimed her son was not borne of King Philip (Val Kilmer) but Zeus himself. Olympias is presented as a Lady MacBeth with a Russian accent and a inferiority complex; we get the sense, really, that she would have preferred to have been born a man and king herself. Philip is a drunk and a lout, but beloved by his army. Driven by vengeance and bloodlust and not destiny, there is a gulf between he and Alexander, between a professional and a prodigy.<br /><br />In Alexander, Stone creates an arrogant, passionate, insecure man, given to fits and bawling, shows of affection and cruelty, greatness and shame. Stone admits Alexander's pansexualism - he "loved" boyhood friend Hephiaston (Jared Leto), Asian bride Roxanna (Rosario Dawson) and a eunuch - but does not push it. Most of all, Stone insists on Alexander's ambition to explore and push farther from home and the known world, for reasons he never quite reveals, although he is haunted by his mother's taunts, and his father's legacy.<br /><br />Because "Alexander" genuinely means to say something about the commonality of man vs. our tendencies to side with like skin and dialect, it's a very talky, stagelike film - long speeches, a couple roundtable sequences. Stone gives us two battles - the second of which, in India, belongs in any conversation about great war scenes - elephants, natives emerging in the jungle, and a dramatic color shift. The first battle at Gaugamela, for Persia, is confusing, muddled game capture the flag, an ancient "Blitz to Baghdad," if you will. Like our three-week campaign Iraq, this strategy eventually fuels a long-running argument between Alexander and his generals. Alexander alone dreams to trailblaze to the "outer ocean." The rest want their lives, their family, and to enjoy the spoils of their victories.<br /><br />At times Ferrell seems overwhelmed by the role of Alexander; most actors would be, it asks for such a range of emotions. But he does give the conquerer a perspective, a bemused intelligence in quieter moments, a bawling rage in others. In the last hour of "Alexander," the conquerer is quite clearly losing it and Ferrell charts the descent well. Ferrell is an performer, not a method actor, so when he goes for it, he does so with instinct. Recent epic heroes Russell Crowe ("Gladiator") Orlando Bloom ("Kingdom of Heaven") and Tom Cruise ("The Last Samurai") have a lot more zen, even machismo, than Alexander.<br /><br />That Ferrell overacts in scenes as son to Olympias and Philip is not entirely his fault. Jolie would rather be seen as impressive than talented; she's an action star so fixated on cool she may never return to the land of subtlety. Her performance is pitched to a junior-high acting class on cartoon accents. I half-expected her to slither or crawl at some point, she's so unhinged. And Kilmer - though simply doing the best he can - is wrong for Philip. His greatness is told, not shown. It does not help that his performance is broken into flashbacks so scattered we can forget what we already know of him.<br /><br />The entire production is scattered, from Stone's fractured structure to the occasional incantation of the Greek gods - it's hard to say whether they matter to Alexander or not - to Dawson's rare and rather pointless appearances as Roxanna. "Alexander" could have been an hour longer and been incomplete; what's odd is that the DVD "Director's Cut" version is actually shorter. The movie may be Stone's rubicon - producers should never trust him with a movie of great scale again.</p></body></html>

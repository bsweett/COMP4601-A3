<meta name="summary" content="Psychological horror with class"></head><body><p>In the best tradition of psychological horror that claims such memorable classics as "Dressed to Kill", "Psycho", and "The Silence of the Lambs"- this film will haunt viewers well beyond the final credits.  Director David Fincher skillfully constructs all the elements of suspense in this tale about a serial killer obsessed with the seven deadly sins:  gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, and lust. The two detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) tracking him become equally obsessed - with capturing the killer before he completes his seven murders.  Freeman and Pitt have great on-screen chemistry that lends a gritty reality to the script. <p>Despite the gruesome plot, this film has an elegance rarely encountered in a commercial film. The suspense is beautifully taut - I caught myself literally holding my breath during certain parts. The pacing is deliberate but never slack, giving the viewer over two hours of intense drama. <p>Turn down the lights, jack up the surround sound, and settle into this tense thriller.  (And make sure you're not alone!)</p></body></html>

I wonder if the filmmakers had bothered pitching it to the Trek franchise.  Can you imagine if Shatner had played the lead?  Shatner playing Shatner playing Kirk.  If the original Trek cast had been in this movie--and it would not have been tough to taylor it a bit back to its original source--it could've been a hilarious classic in the Trek canon.<br /><br />But I don't want to take anything away from the cast in the film.  Tim Allen really breaks out of his stand-up/sitcom persona and plays a Shatner-esque role.  I was really surprised as to how good he was in this movie.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver is almost too intimidating as a serious actress.  Depsite the blond hair and push-up bra, she's still Sigourney Weaver, Academy Award nominated actress.  In GHOSTBUSTERS, she played the straight gal to Bill Murray, an Academy Award nominated comedian.  In GALAXY QUEST, she's playing another washed-up sci fi actress...but I still see Sigourney Weaver!  Wasn't too distracting and she was very good.  (But when you think about it, how great could some of the typecast actors and actresses have been if they hadn't been pigeon-holed by a iconic role?)<br /><br />Alan Rickman is another incredibly talented actor (although best known as Hans Gruber, the slick German mastermind in DIE HARD).  If he hadn't been hidden under his silly alien makeup, his impressive talent might have been distracting as well--but it's not!  He's excellent.  The rest of the cast is great as well, especially Tony Shalhoub and Sam Rockwell.<br /><br />One of the reasons I waited to see this film was because I thought it would goof on the Trek fans.  With scenes at a sci-fi convention and fans as characters, I was afraid that the film would pile on to make fun of them.  Kind of like when Shatner did the "Saturday Night Live" sketch where he tells the Trekkies to "get a life."  Funny, but too easy of a target.<br /><br />Well, GALAXY QUEST doesn't take that easy route.  It doesn't poke fun at the fans.  In fact, the fans actually come out as heroes in some scenes.  It's a film that understands the fan's affection and doesn't insult them.<br /><br />A funny and fun movie!  Check it out.</p></body></html>

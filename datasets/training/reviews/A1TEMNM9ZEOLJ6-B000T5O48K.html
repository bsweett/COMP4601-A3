Harry Connick Jr.'s beefcake role is interesting, though his good-guy image isn't quite overcome by menace. Director Billy Friedkin, by his own admission, hasn't made a decent movie since "Rosemary's Baby" and "French Connection." The big fire ending here is anti-climactic. It's a film version of a play. Watch it for what it's worth.</p></body></html>

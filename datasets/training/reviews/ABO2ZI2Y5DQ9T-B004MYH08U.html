<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing Michel Gondry Action Film"></head><body><p>The 2011 "Green Hornet" film opens with an arch-villain Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz) gently asking (= threatening) a club owner and drug dealer "Crystal Cleer" (uncredited James Franco) to hand over the business to him. It is fun as the two actors know what they are doing, delivering delightfully scenery-chewing performances. To me the opening is the best part of the film. And the Green Hornet is not in it.<br /><br />Seth Rogen (who also co-wrote and co-executive produced the film) is Britt Reid / The Green Hornet. He first appears as a 28-year-old slacker of a Los Angels newspaper publisher James Reid (Tom Wilkinson). Unlike most superhero films (or any films for that matter), they are not very likable persons. James is an arrogant and domineering father. Britt is just a spoiled son with no redeeming grace whatever.<br /><br />But you expect something happen to Brit, like character development. Not much. Seth Rogen remains unconvincing as the protagonist (was he?) throughout "The Green Hornet." He talks too much, but does little. What does he want to be, a crime-fighting hero or a self-conscious parody of the genre? Or just an annoyingly goofy playboy?<br /><br />Jay Chou fares slightly better as Kato. After all his character (once played by legendary Bruce Lee) can do something, like doing martial arts and making good coffee. Cameron Diaz appears as Lenore, newly-hired secretary and love interest, a thankless role made for the film's unnecessary romantic subplot. As to the actions, well, the action sequences are not great, not knowing when to stop. They lack rhythm and style. They break things a lot and that's all.<br /><br />Finally the film is directed by Michel Gondry. Those who expected (like me) a happy marriage of action/superhero genre and his imagination of "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" will be disappointed. Like his previous feature film "Be Kind Rewind" something is not right about the film, as if he is not really allowed to show what he can do.</p></body></html>

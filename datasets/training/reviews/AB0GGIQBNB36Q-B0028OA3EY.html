Superman would never leave earth without telling Lois, Two. If this movie really took place after the Richard Lester Superman II, he broke his promise. Because before he flew off the roof of the white house, he informed the president he wouldn't let us down again. But yet in this movie, he just leaves, and appearently leaves Lois with a kid, which is his. OOps did I spoil anything, I agree with some of the other reviews, this movies acts like it's ashamed to be a Comic book movie, and tries to be serious. While Bryan Singer did an excellent job with the X-Men movies, he clearly shows he has no idea how to handle Superman, it was a rehash of the first Christopher Reeve Superman movie. And for those who just let this movie get by with a pass, shame on you, This movie's idiocy was shoved into one scene. The infamous krypton island scene, now people have tried to explain it away, but you can't really fix bad scriptwriting, particularly when you establish rules in a movie. You can't just abandon them five minutes later in the movie, now when Superman lands on the island. He immediately loses his powers, gets beat up by Luthor's henchmen, then gets shived, but after Lois rescues him. He flies into the sun, recharges. And flies back to the island, but flies under it. Now here's where the problem arrives, Superman is protected from Kryptonite by wearing LEAD. NOT MUD, and he still has his powers, even after he's flying the island into space and his protection is falling away leaving him exposed to the Kryptonite, is he effected, Naw. Now once he tosses it into space, we get a drama scene, by the way. This movie is full of them, anyway he falls back to earth. This movie, much like "The Dark Knight" was not a comic book movie, it was trying to be serious. IT"S A SUPERMAN MOVIE, this movie isn't</p></body></html>

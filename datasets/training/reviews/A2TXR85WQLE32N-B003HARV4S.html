This movie seems designed for a smaller art house audience.<br /><br />The movie opens with a prologue in which a common young cabinet-maker becomes interested in magic and draws the attention and affection of a young noblewoman.  Their romance is a forbidden one, and the young man leaves home to find his fortune.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" properly gets underway as the acclaimed magician Eisenheim returns to 19th Century Vienna after a long absence.  Played with stoic and enigmatic understatement by Edward Norton, Eisenheim peforms some remarkable feats on stage, so good that the viewer is never quite sure, until the end of the movie, whether he is the simple illusionist he claims to be, or something more.<br /><br />One night, a volunteer from the audience turns out to be the noblewoman Sophie (played by Jessica Biel), fiancee of Leopold the Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, but once Eisenheim's childhood sweetheart.  The two contrive to meet in private, to the anger of Leopold, played by Rufus Sewell as an ambitious but abusive and drunken lout.  Leopold sends Police Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to warn off Eisenheim.<br /><br />Eisenheim and Sophie are soon committed to a desperate plan to be together, only to be foiled by Sophie's apparent murder by Leopold.  An angry Eisenheim begins a subtle campaign to challenge and undermine Leopold through his magic shows, initiating a contest of wills with Uhl, who is torn between his duty to investigate Sophie's murder and his ambition to rise with the Crown Prince.  As the movie spins out to its violent conclusion, the only thing the viewer can count on is that nothing is quite as it seems.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" nicely captures the atmospherics of Vienna in its last decades as capital of the Austria-Hungarian Empire.  The movie has a measured pace, meditating over its detailed period sets and relying on some superb acting, especially by Giamatti, to carry along a rather austere plot.  The ending is nicely done, if a little too convenient for the dark tone of most of the movie.  Sharp-eyed viewers may see it coming, but the movie tries hard to be subtle.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as good entertainment for fans of the magic genre.</p></body></html>

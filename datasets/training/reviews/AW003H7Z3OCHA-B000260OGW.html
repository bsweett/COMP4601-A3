<meta name="summary" content="Not since Dances w/wolves has Costner film looked this good!"></head><body><p>This Movie review is predominantly about this 2-Disc DVD Collection Edition with a few editorial (personal observations) comments.<p>Kevin Costner's passion is truly in the American Western.  He has proved it with one of the greatest Western films &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; (Top 100 AFI (American Film Institute) American film of last 100 years (circa 1998).<p>Now with &quot;OPEN RANGE&quot; Kevin Costner has again returned to his great film making with another soon to be Western Classic.  I loved this movie!!!! A great story, fantastic breath taking panoramic cinematography (Alberta, Canada), an outstanding supporting cast with Robert Duvall as &quot;Boss&quot;, Annette Bening as &quot;Sue&quot;, Michael Jetter as &quot;Percy&quot; and Costner as &quot;Charlie&quot;, with plenty of drama, action and true romance.  (My wife loved it too!!)<p>Summary of this DVD set;  Disc-1 - Open Range Feature film in 2.35:1 Ratio Widescreen Anamorphic (automatically adjusts to any television size) Format.  And Enhanced for 16:9 Home Theatre HDTV's.  (what a magnificent Picture &amp; dynamic DTS 5.1 Digital Surround Sound).  Audio Commentary w/Kevin Costner (very informative).  Disc-2 - Special Features; &quot;America's Open Range&quot; a 60 min historical journey back in time to the open range of the 1800's narrated by Kevin Costner (very enlightening/informative), &quot;Beyond the Range&quot; Directors Journal about the making of Open Range, 10 Deleted Scenes w/optional Kevin Costner commentary, StoryBoarding: Open Range and Music Video Montage.<p>This is a must see Classic Western especially the 20 minute climatic gun fight (better than the gun fight at the OK Corral).  Rent it, Buy it, I guarrantee you'll be watching this movie again and again.  The Direction, Cinematography the Storyline the Cast are the best!!!  To bad the general public missed this movie the first time around.  Here's your chance to watch/own this Classic Western DVD set !!!  Don't miss it.  Enjoy.</p></body></html>

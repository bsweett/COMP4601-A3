<meta name="summary" content="Very Unique and Very Good Movie"></head><body><p>To watch this film is to watch something very special.  To watch these birds try to survive in such a cruel environment and to see what they have to do to brave 100 below zero temperatures.  How can anything survive in such a harsh place?  Watch and you will be amazed.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman does an excellent job as narrator. The "easy reader" does a very superb job of reading here.</p></body></html>

The ship's captain, "Lucky" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), is ordered to track down and engage the French frigate, Acheron.  One foggy night, the Surprise happens upon the Acheron, with full out battle following.  The Surprise is forced to retreat, and a genuinely exciting game of cat and mouse between the two ships ensues for the rest of the film.<br /><br />Clunky title notwithstanding, "Master and Commander" is a truly superb action film.  I have never been a fan of movies about 19th century seafaring.  The battle scenes are too often both static and confusing.  However, Peter Weir is more than up to the task here; he's always been an outstanding director, but this film is among his best work.  The chase scenes and ensuing battles are suspenseful and fully engaging.  Weir also manages to infuse a great deal of humanity - each time a member of the Surprise is killed or even injured, it's heart-breaking.  Fortunately, he was rewarded with an Oscar nomination for directing, his fourth.<br /><br />The Oscar nominated script is beautiful but never cloying, with wonderful acting contributing to its success.  Crowe and Bettany (as Dr. Stephen Maturin) brilliantly portray the complex relationship between their characters - close friends who respect but also challenge each other.  The film is, of course, based on two novels from the esteemed series by Patrick O'Brian.  I have not read any of the Aubrey-Maturin books, so I cannot attest to how accurate the film is.  However, clearly a viewer need not have read the books to enjoy the film.  Incidentally, I immediately purchased the first book in the series and hope to tackle it soon.  Finally, every technical aspect of "Master and Commander" is exceptional - the score, cinematography, costumes, and so forth.  All these elements add up to a lush modern classic.</p></body></html>

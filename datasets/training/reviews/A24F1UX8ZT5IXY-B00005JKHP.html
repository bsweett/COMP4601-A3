<meta name="summary" content="True Science Fiction."></head><body><p>STTMP is a dark, almost depressing film. The costumes are heinous. The new enterprise is an antiseptic monstrosity. Spock is manically depressed. Kirk is acting like a [...].<br /><br />Yet, it is one of the few films that really takes a plunge into the core of science fiction and makes no apologies. It is a totally indulgent experience, as we almost feel like we are on the enterprise surrounded by this totally alien power known as V'ger -- which, by the way, is an incredible marvel of special effects. For all of the magnificence of The Wrath of Khan, that film is exceedingly light SF when compared with this.<br /><br />Although the film is slowly paced, it almost the perfect thing for a serious Trek fan. I personally do not have any problem looking at the gorgeously redesigned Enterprise (the exterior that is) and listening to Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful, nautical score. The film is a grand indulgence for die-hard fans of Trek. But probably an utter bore for others.<br /><br />And there are many gems therein as well. Spock's scenes are fabulous. From the opening on Vulcan (now beautifully re-designed) to his exploration of V'ger, they are some of the highlights of the film. But there is much more to be loved here, nothing less than Ilia and the totally bizarre climax to V'ger. This is GOOD Trek along the lines of the old series.</p></body></html>

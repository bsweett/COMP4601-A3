<meta name="summary" content="Dehumanisation"></head><body><p>"Full Metal Jacket" is a very effective movie about the training and war in Vietnam. Following the character Private Joker, the movie takes in the training of new recruits and their experiences in Vietnam.<br /><br />The movie itself really is an illustration of the dehumanising effects of war and the training. Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann particularly illustrates this in his treatment of Private Pyle, (and, yes, Hartman has a lot of fun with Pyle's name). The dehumanising theme is continued in the Vietnam part of the movie, with the soldier's views on the locals being very much as objects. The movie does not simplify it, but looks at the complexities of the moral choices that face the soldiers in the movie.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is a powerful look into the realities of war's effects on people. It is a hard movie to really "enjoy", but it is a very good film all the same. I have seen it a few times, and it has stuck in my memory for the way it addresses a very complicated and broad topic.</p></body></html>

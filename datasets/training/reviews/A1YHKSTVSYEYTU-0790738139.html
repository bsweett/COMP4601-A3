Confidential is a violent but gripping thriller which examines the dark underbelly and corruption of the city of LA, at a time when it still held a beautiful movie star image. Principally, this is the story of 3 very different cops, Bud White (Russell Crowe), Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) and Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce), who have totally different ways of getting the job done. Each with their own agenda, each with their own character and each corrupt to a differing degree, their paths cross in this intricate but brilliantly plotted movie as they seek to find &quot;the coffee shop killers&quot; and solve the mystery of high class prostitutes &quot;cut&quot; to look like movie stars. Brilliantly directed by Curtis Hanson and based on a James Ellroy novel, LA Confidential also boasts an outstanding supporting cast including, James Cromwell, David Strathairn, Danny Devito and the Oscar winning Kim Basinger. The best film of 1998 and perhaps even the best film of the nineties, LA Confidential should have walked off with a barrowload of Oscars. Better than a thousand Titanic's (if you disagree you're wrong) , LA Confidential never fails to hit it's mark and is simply unmissable.</p></body></html>

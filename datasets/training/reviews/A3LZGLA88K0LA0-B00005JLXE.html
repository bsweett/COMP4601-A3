<meta name="summary" content="NOT SO DARING A DEVIL"></head><body><p>Maybe I'm getting old or something, but remember in the days of superheroes of old (Superman, Batman,etc.), the superheroes were just that ---SUPER.  In this flick, Ben Affleck as Daredevil gets his butt kicked by Jennifer Garner, Michael Clarke Duncan and Colin Farrell----he's like wimpo the magnificent!  I know they do this to make it more "realistic?", but look folks, no one likes to see their good guy get bounced all over the place, especially by a woman!!!!!  That out of the way, DAREDEVIL didn't fully work for me because it is sooooo DARK and DISMAL.  Even the lighting is moody and morose.  Granted, most of the CGI effects were impressive, but unlike SPIDERMAN, they weren't as fluent or viewable.  Daredevil moves around so fast you can't really tell what he's doing.<br />Affleck surprised me with a good performance, particularly in his non-Daredevil scenes; Garner was gorgeous, but it was hard to swallow her kung fun antics; Colin Farrell was very good as Bullseye--he's the only one who looked like he was having a good time; Duncan is wasted as Kingpin; although a good actor, he was woefully miscast in this one.<br />Although DAREDEVIL is ultimately entertaining, it's like eating an eclair..it's good while you're eating it, but it's really just a lot of dough with no filling.</p></body></html>

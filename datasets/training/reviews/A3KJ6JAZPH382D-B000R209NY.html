<meta name="summary" content="Big Boat Go Flop!"></head><body><p>The original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHSVNW">Poseidon Adventure</a> was Irwin Allen in his disaster film best...ensemble acting with a tragedy to work through. He worked that formula like no-one else...so when Wolfgang Petersen went to remake it, he did what he should have. He scrapped what Allen was magic at and inserted his own strength in their place. Which meant characters that might not be the most interesting, but working as a team to overcome the odds (think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767802470">Das Boot</a>).<br /><br />To that end, his "Poseidon" is a faster paced, tighter and shorter movie than Allen's and moves at such a tear that it's hard to notice when it falters. The cast is helmed by Kurt Russell (playing troubled macho as only he can), Josh Lucas (loner gambler subbing for Gene Hackman's loner priest) and Richard Dreyfuss (gay man just jilted by his ex for a younger man). Along with seven other survivors, this group must battle fire, water and the clock to climb up the ship to safety.<br /><br />Minus the 3-dimensional characters, Petersen gives us a 3-dimensional ship. The effects are a marvel (the bonus disc shows you just how few CGI effects were used) and the opening wave scene is visceral in its blunt force. The capsizing boat, with the ensuing death and the mayhem, will scare the saltwater out of you. Maybe even more so than some horror movies. Little time is wasted between survival episodes, although the nod to Shelly Winters' swim team dialog from the original is a nice touch. The survivors overcome obstacle after peril and each more tense than the last.<br /><br />There is, naturally, a happy ending. Just who makes it out and how is the fun of "Poseidon." Once it's over, make sure to watch the DVD extras, with the Crew Diary being interesting and the Special Effects feature fascinating.</p></body></html>

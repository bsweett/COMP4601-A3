<meta name="summary" content="Best flaming skull superhero movie ever made!"></head><body><p>All I really expected going into Mark Steven Johnson's "Ghost Rider" was a superhero movie with really cool special effects, a fairly close resemblance to the original comic series, and a plot that wasn't atrocious.  For the most part it was a success.  Far from award-winning, it's simple, light entertainment with awesome special effects.<br /><br />After learning his father has cancer, circus motorcycle stuntman Johnny Blaze makes a Faustian bargain with Satan.  The deal: Johnny's soul for his father's health.  What Johnny doesn't realize is that Satan can't be trusted (How he didn't know that I have no idea), and he's now committed himself to be Satan's bounty hunter.  Whenever near evil he transforms into a ghost rider: a chain-clad flaming skeleton in a leather jacket who rides a tricked-out, demonic motorcycle.  His primary mission is to act as a spirit of vengeance and take down Satan's son, Blackheart, who wishes to take over earth.<br /><br />Aside from the commitment Cage made to get into shape for the movie, the other eye candy involved is Eva Mendes, who looks incredible.  In nearly every scene not saturated with special effects, she steals the scene.  The real star, however, is the CGI.  A flaming motorcycle ripping through cities, roaring up the side of skyscrapers and melting windows, capturing evil-doers in a flaming chain, sending hell-fire flying into the sky, destroying everything and causing small animals to spontaneously combust, it's all in a day's work for a ghost rider.  That's what I call a good time.<br /><br />The major problems with this film are the poor plot and complete lack of character development.  Sure, there is the ghost rider legend, but beyond that we don't really get to hear an explanation for his antagonists, their quest, or much less anyone else.  Additionally, there is nearly no explanation for their characters or Sam Elliot's graveyard sage, and more than one evil entity is just thrown in without explanation.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the visuals, and for fans of the comic, but not much else.</p></body></html>

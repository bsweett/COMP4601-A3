Dewie Finn gets kicked out of his band and must find a way to pay the rent.  When he intercepts a phone call for his substitute teacher roommate, Ned, Dewie decides to take the job.  At first, he has no idea what to do, but when he discovers the kids in the class are great musicians, he decides to turn them into a band.  Along the way, Dewie gets to know them all while also teaching them the history of rock.  This is a great movie that surprisingly can be seen by the whole family.  Jack Black has never been better, and the kids are amazing.  If nothing else, the soundtrack is great with plenty of Led Zeppelin, The Clash, Black Sabbath and so much more.<p> Jack Black is perfectly cast as Dewie Finn, the down on his luck musician who takes a job as a substitute teacher.  His eyebrows and facial expressions could not be done by anyone else.  Joan Cusack is also very good as Principal Mullins, who tries to keep her school in order.  Mike White and Sarah Silverman also star as Ned, Dewie's roommate, and his evil girlfriend.  The real stars of this movie are the kids in Dewie's class.  They are all incredible performers as well as pretty good actors.  With all these things combined, School of Rock is a can't miss movie.  For a great movie with hilarious Jack Black, check out School of Rock!</p></body></html>

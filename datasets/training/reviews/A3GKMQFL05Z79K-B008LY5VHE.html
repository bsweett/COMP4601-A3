This causes the local police chief to round up a marine biologist and a professional shark hunter to go on the hunt for the thing. What happens during the course of that hunt is going to surprise you.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Peter Benchley, Jaws was directed by Stephen Spielberg(as you all know) and, after viewing the movie, I believe it is one of Spielberg's biggest achievements in filmmaking. Even though, when you watch The Making of Jaws featurette, he expresses the fact that it was very difficult to make the picture. Shot mostly on location on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, the film had a troubled production(mostly dealing with the mechanical shark for the film), going over budget and past schedule. The movie itself was well-recieved by critics and fans alike. It was the highest grossing film of its' time, in 1975.  The film stars Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper, Robert Shaw as shark hunter Quint(my favorite character out of the whole movie), Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island, and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen. It spawned  three sequels, none with the participation of Spielberg or Benchley, with varying success. It's been imitated many, many times through the years in different movies about sharks but not with as much success as Jaws.<br /><br />Honestly, I've always been more interested in Spielberg's Science-Fiction movies(like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extraterrestrial, Jurassic Park, and War of the Worlds) but this movie has me looking up his older movies no matter what genre of movie to watch. Jaws is a great movie and one that should be viewed by everyone at some point. It truly is worthy of its' accolades.</p></body></html>

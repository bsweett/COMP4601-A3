<meta name="summary" content="It looks terrible on Blu-ray"></head><body><p>Warner Bros seems to be trying to populate their Blu-ray portfolio on the cheap. The sound is just Dolby 5.1, the same as a cheap DVD would have (some DVD have better) and the picture... it might have been some artistic selection to make it so but, I am not kidding, I spent 15-20 minutes while watching this movie trying to adjust my TV, thinking that maybe it was something wrong with it.<br /><br />I will not recommend buying this. News to Warner Bros: Blu-ray allows you to include nice things such as 'uncompressed' audio and I can't think of any excuse for not having it on a relatively recent movie.</p></body></html>

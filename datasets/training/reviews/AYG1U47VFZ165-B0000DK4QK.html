<meta name="summary" content="A Johnny Depp Film Worth Seeing"></head><body><p>Heavy on atmosphere and even heavier on conspiracy theories, FROM HELL boasts outstanding performances from Johnny Depp and Heather Graham as two lost souls crying out for one another's company while remaining caught in the twists and turns of Jack the Ripper's nefarious deeds toward the end of the 1900s.  A fascinatingly brisk tale, not for the squeamish of heart or stomach, but one that dares to draw its one conclusions when other pictures have failed to do so.  Sit back, have some popcorn, and enjoy the suspense.</p></body></html>

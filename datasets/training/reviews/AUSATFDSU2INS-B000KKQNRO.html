<meta name="summary" content="Divine conspiracy"></head><body><p>The radical and controversial reaction caused by the movie The Da Vinci Code was to be expected since the moment director Ron Howard decided to make it, for in the last couple of years few books have generated such an extreme polemic reaction that, four years after its publication, seems like it will never end.<br /><br />My review will be limited to comment the movie, because it is not my intention to start a religious debate about the theories exposed in the novel. For me, The Da Vinci Code is just another fiction film, and as such, I will discuss it.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is one of those movies like Indiana Jones, The Mummy, etc., that combines adventure, history, mythologym mystery and action. The plot revolves around Harvard History/Symbology Professor Robert Langdon, French Cryptologist Sophie Neveau and their quest to discover the hidden clues left by the Louvre's Museum Curator before he was murdered by an Opus Dei Monk called Silas. These clues are part of a secret that -if revealed- would supposedly change the course of history: the truth about the Holy Grail. Of course, there will be allies for Langdon and Neveau in this journey, like an eccentric Englishman (the always fabulous Ian McKellen) and some detractors, an Opus Dei bishop (Alfred Molina), members of the Catholic Church, a French policeman (Jean Reno) and a secret "master" that desperately wants to uncover the truth.<br /><br />It's a long journey through history, religions, family secrets and complex puzzles and riddles. Screenwiter Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind) does a great job compressing the detailed narrative from Brown's book, allowing himself to take some liberties with the plot, which results in unexpected twists, but welcome ones.<br /><br />The characters in the movie are as plain as they are on the book, but each actor does the best they can with their parts. The exceptions are Sir Ian McKellen and Paul Bettany, whose characters are the richest and in consequence, the more interesting ones.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is a good thriller-adventure movie, filmed in gorgeous settings, starring a very attractive cast and enhanced with a score by Hans Zimmer. His contribution is most notorious and grateful in the last ten minutes, where Howard offers a respectful and almost reverential finale to Langdon's journey, and with that, a spectacular ending to a very entertaining movie. Yes, a movie, just a movie, nothing else.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rocky Balboa: What's so crazy about standing toe to toe with someone saying "I am"?"></head><body><p>For the sixth and final film of his legendary boxing series, writer/director Sly Stallone brings back characters only seen some 30 years earlier.<br /><br />Spider Rico (Lovell), the opponent defeated by Rocky Balboa at the start of the first story, is now punch drunk and a recipient of the ex-champ's affectionate protection. Little Marie (Hughes), the teen who insulted Rocky when he suggested she clean up her act, is this final picture's leading lady. Sly's kid brother Frank, who had singing cameos in the first three movies, appears briefly in a restaurant scene.<br /><br />Archive footage vividly depicts several ghosts from Rocky's past: his beloved wife Adrian, manager and best friend Mickey Goldmill, and ring opponents Ivan Drago and Clubber Lang. Conspicuously missing is Apollo Creed, although Rock reminisces about their epic first bout.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />In this emotionally moving last chapter, Adrian's dead, Rocky lives only for the past. At 55, he has bouts of melancholy over her loss. Paulie (Young), Spider Rico (Lovell) and trainer Tony (Burton) are all that remain of the old days. Even the ice rink where Adrian and Rocky had their first date is rubble.<br /><br />A computer simulation of Rocky fighting current champ Mason 'the Line' Dixon (light heavyweight champ Tarver) revives interest in the old slugger. Somehow, undefeated Dixon convinces Rocky to meet him in Las Vegas for an exhibition match. In doing so, Rocky is able to put to rest forever all the old memories that have been troubling him.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.3) Rocky Balboa (2006) - Sylvester Stallone/Burt Young/Antonio Tarver/Geraldine Hughes/Milo Ventimiglia/Tony Burton/Mike Tyson/Pedro Lovell/Jim Lampley.Larry Merchant/Max Kellerman/LeRoy Neiman/Bert Sugar/Frank Stallone</p></body></html>

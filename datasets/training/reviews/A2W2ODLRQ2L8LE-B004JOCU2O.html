The objective is to get goods from point A to point B as quickly and safely as possible. Along the route there may be different switches and changeovers that may be encountered. Computers play a major role in the scheduling of trains in order to optimize the use of the rails. Over land, in terms of ton-miles hauled per unit of consumed energy, rail transport is more efficient than other means of transportation.<br /><br />This film is about a half-mile long freight train that was allowed to run away without its engineer, who was just a bit too careless and too slow. Initially it was thought that it was a 'coaster' - just rolling, but not under power, so they tried an initial interception down the track. But to their surprise, the train as long gone and now moving at a speed approaching 70 miles per hour. To make matters worse, the train has a huge amount of diesel fuel that it is carrying to keep it running, and if that is not bad enough, several of the cars contain explosive, toxic chemicals that are used to make glue.<br /><br />The Heroes:<br /><br />The guys who will take on the last effort ot stop this train are:<br /><br />- Frank (Denzil Washington) a veteran engineer with 18 years experience.<br />- Will (Chris Pine) a rookie now getting some hands-on training.<br /><br />There is a little animosity between the two initally, as Frank, sees himself as the old hand that is being phased out, and replaced by an inexperienced novice, with only theoretical training. However, when the crisis arises, they set aside their differences and rise to the challenge.<br /><br />The Experience:<br /><br />Watching this movie is a riveting experience. The momentum (mass x velocity) of the trains come across the screen big time. There are close passes and near misses that can make you sweat just watching them. There is a lot of stunt work especially at the ending. You can really get into this movie as the tension continues to build. The end is indeed quite rewarding, and you know that you have been taken to the edge and back again.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />What I like about this movie is the way that it captures the determination and resolve of the human spirit, to risk everything for the safety of others.</p></body></html>

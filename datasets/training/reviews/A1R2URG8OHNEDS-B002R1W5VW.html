<meta name="summary" content="The Best Film of the Year!"></head><body><p>2003 was a great year for movies. With classics such as About Schmidt, 25th Hour, Adaptation, Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and Punch Drunk Love, I was finally given the best film of the year so far. Matchstick Men.<p>Matchstick Men stars Nicolas Cage as Roy Waller. Ridden with ticks and obsessive complusion disorder, Roy keeps his house extremly organized. Roy is a con man(con artist!) and he and his partner Frank have been doing small jobs. But Frank wants to bring Roy into a big job. To dupe a man Chuck Frechette into a currency enchange con. But Roy drops his medicine down the drain and the shortage of his ILLIGAL med's causes him to go over the edge with his problem. Frank suggests that he see a shrink and he meets Dr. Klein and we find out that Roy ws married and that he might have a 14 year old daughter. Klein calls his ex wife to find out because Roy has problems talking to her. And Roy meets his 14 year old daughter Angela. <p>Angela like his tics and his disorder. But when he tells her what he really does for a living(he says he's an antique's broker) and she forces him to teach her the tricks of the trade. But the help in the latest con goes wrong, with surprising results.<p>Matchstick Men was excellant. I loved everything and everyone about it. It had a plot with three story lines so if one plotline goes out there are always fallbacks. But non of the storylines ever leaves you uninterested. The first storyline is Roy's problem with his illness. The second one is Frank and Roy's con. The third is the more personal storyline about Roy and his relationship with his new found daughter. The movie drifts from comedy, to suspense, to heart. With an ending that is so unexpected you would never see it coming. There are no hints of it in the advertising for you to even guess that it is coming. <p>Go see Matchstick Men. No question. It is no doubt the best film of the year 2003 so far and along with the lists of the best films of all time. Great acting by Nicolas Cage, Sam Rockwell, and Loyman playing his daughter, with a great score by composer Hans Zimmer. Matchstick Men is the kind of movie that I've been waiting for and it finally came. I am patently waiting for it to come to DVD, because I'm getting on the first day.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated PG-13 for thematic elements, violence, some sexual content and language.</p></body></html>

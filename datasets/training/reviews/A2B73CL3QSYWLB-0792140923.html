This film does not so much contain a story but a series of random events that our hero stumbles into(Stupid is as stupid does).  What is most impressive about Robert Zemeckis' direction is how CGI is utilized to integrate his characters into historical events.  What least impresses is how these techniques detract from the characters.  What distinguishes this film is the acting, particularly Tom Hanks as Forrest.  Yes, Forrest has an I.Q. of 80, but he's nobody's fool.  What ingratiates you to this character is that he has a heart a mile wide.  This is a tricky bit of acting that Hanks does here because playing somebody who is mentally challenged is a slippery slope(If you want an example of how not to play the mentally retarded,see or don't see Cliff Robertson's performance in "Charly").  The film also benefits from a superb supporting cast with Gary Sinise as the embittered Lt. Dan, Robin Wright as Jenny(though I thought it too much that she had to suffer so many indignities), Mykelti Williamson as Bubba, and Sally Field as Forrest's mother.  This film in subsequent years has been criticized, fairly or unfairly, as sappy or condesending.  What I would add to that is the public took this character into their bosom.  I think it's a fair assessment that you can fool at least some segment of the theatre going public.  I don't think this film would have been the phenomenon that it was if the public thought they were being taken for a ride.</p></body></html>

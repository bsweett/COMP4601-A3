Well, that was the scene at my home as we watched The Grudge.<br /><br />I have to admit that there were several times when we all jumped<br /><br />and some of the scenes had that scary surprised element, but most of us find it very frustrating to just sit and watch a house and some cat and little boy running around. It took most of the movie to even find out there was a curse put on the house.<br /><br />Now, my sister-in-law thought it was very scary, so go figure.<br /><br />Personally I was bored and frustrated with this moive and was glad when it was over, but you decide.  To each his own.</p></body></html>

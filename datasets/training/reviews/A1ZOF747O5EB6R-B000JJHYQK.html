<meta name="summary" content="Good Escapism"></head><body><p>"The Sentinel" is an excellent thriller genre movie.  Loads of action and a plot that doesn't completely slip into the absurd as is so often the case with modern movies.<br /><br />Michael Douglas plays Secret Service agent Pete Garrison.  He is having an affair with the US President's wife (Kim Basinger).  This information comes to the attention of a group intent on killing the President.  Garrison is suspended from the service when he fails a polygraph test although this test is not directly related to the affair.  Garrison is simply collateral damage.<br /><br />In the process of redeeming himself, Garrison is isolated and is seen as a threat to the service itself.  He becomes a fugitive.  He has no where to turn.<br /><br />As the plot reaches its climax, Garrison's new understanding of events becomes the general knowledge.  The real threat to the President is actually a mole within the service.  Garrison emerges as a hero.<br /><br />While the plot is formulaic, the action grips the viewer.  Almost two hours seems to fly past as one is kept on the edge of one's seat.  No, this movie will never win an Oscar for best film, but it is good escapism.  Overall, a rewarding experience.</p></body></html>

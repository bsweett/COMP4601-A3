That's when I began to see and understand how great a performer and singer Johnny Cash was. The more I learn about the man and his life, the more I am drawn to him. Cash was a man whose music was able to cross all kinds of boundaries: rich and poor, minorities and white people, good citizens and those in jail. His songs (many of his most popular tunes he didn't write) touched people where they were.  They were rooted in the toil of daily living and in the grit and grind of humanity.<br /><br />WALK THE LINE is an excellent biopic about one segment of The Man in Black's life. The movie is not a full-fledged biography. Instead, it is a shorten tale of Cash's life that tells of the love story between John R. Cash and one June Carter.<br /><br />The movie opens with Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) preparing to go on stage at Folsom County Prison to make his comeback (which all the record producers say is impossible to do at a prison). He sees a table saw and is taken back to when he was a child growing up in rural Arkansas. The childhood segment does a couple of important things for the story line. One, it shows that even as a child Cash had an infatuation with June Carter (he listens to her and her family on the radio all the time and stares at her pictures in magazines).  Secondly, it shows that from an early age, Cash knew pain--pain which made him sing like no other, but which also eventually led to his addiction to pain killers.<br /><br />The movie flashes ahead from Cash's childhood to his brief stint in the service until he finally returns home and marries his sweetheart.  Cash is a man of vision, but his wife Vivian (played by the lovely Ginnifer Goodwin) wants John to give up his dream and settle down. Through perseverance and a lot of luck, Cash and his band have the opportunity to perform for Sam Phillips, the legendary owner of Sun Records who discovered not only Johnny Cash but Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis as well. Suddenly, Cash becomes a big star.<br /><br />However, the higher his star rises, the more mixed-up becomes his personal life. Wife Vivian is just not happy with Johnny on the road so much. Johnny becomes more and more addicted to pain killers and alcohol and his childhood infatuation with June Carter turns into full-fledged grown-up love, tinged with a lot of lust.  June Carter knows better and though she connects with Cash, she knows that until he gets his act together they can't be together. The movie follows the relationship between these two until they are eventually married after an on-and-off again courtship of almost decades.<br /><br />The acting in WALK THE LINE is some of the finest in any film this year. Joaquin Phoenix, who has a higher pitched voice than many, does an excellent job of recreating the essence of Johnny Cash's tone and timber (though the real Cash had a deeper baritone/bass).  Reese Witherspoon should be able to put to rest forever all those critics who said she was nothing more than a pretty face who had no talent because as close as Phoenix is to Cash, Witherspoon seems like a cloned version of a young June Carter. The two stars aren't the only ones to shine, because the supporting cast is just as good.<br /><br />The overall tone is somewhat serious because as much as this is a love story, it is a love story about two people who lived really screwed up lives (don't we all?).  That's one of the reasons the movie (like Cash's music) is so powerful; it's real and honest and can touch people where they are.<br /><br />Cash purists can find many faults with the film. There are points that some dramatic liberties are taken. Some characters are only represented one-sided. At times the film moves slow. Despite all this, none of these things really takes away from the film or from the life of Johnny Cash. Instead, the movie augments The Man in Black and illustrates why he was able to become admired by so many and a legend in his time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Umm.....Predictable and tepid..those are compliments, right?"></head><body><p>I waited a while to see this film.  It didn't seem like it would be worth watching.  So I asked several people who said it was okay.  Others said it was good.  I should have considered the source.<p>This movie is just plain boring.  I read another review that said it should have been a straight to video release.  I couldn't agree more.<p>The only reason this film made it to the theaters is that Colin Farrell is seeing an upward spike in his popularity. (I doubt it will last.  I like him well enough, but the press on his personal life is far more interesting than his acting ability).<p>A guy is stuck in a phone booth, because someone on the other end of the phone is going to kill him or someone else - that's the premise of the movie.  It doesn't deviate from that - not once.  I knew what was coming from a mile away.  I knew what was going to happen at the end and I knew who would be blamed with everything.<p>There's just not much to this film.  It's threadbare in its plot.  You don't really care about the lead (Farrell), nor do you give a flip about anyone else.  There's no reason to.  The screenwriters nor the director bother giving us enough information to feel any identification with any of the characters.<p>Phone Booth garnered hype only because at the time of its initial release, a sniper started shooting up D.C. in reality.  Since the premise of this film is a sniper, it gave this weak film millions of dollars of worth of free publicity.<p>Don't bother!  Really!</p></body></html>

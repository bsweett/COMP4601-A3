<meta name="summary" content="A Return to Form"></head><body><p>I like all six of the previous Harry Potter films, but I'm not a big fan of what director, David Yates, has done with the last two installments. Maybe it's just the source material, which I have yet to read, but while the stories have gotten darker (which I like), they have also become less interesting. I do understand that the innocence of the early films can't remain for the plot or characters to progress.<br /><br />Now, having said all that, I think Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is very well done. Sure there are some overlong sequences, too many characters forgotten about due to the huge cast, and I do miss seeing Hogwarts, but judging by the first half of the final chapter, it's going to end on a high note. The main trio have all grown as actors in more ways than one. All of the supporting players we've seen over the years are a welcome sight, but like I said before, often given too little to say or do.<br /><br />The CGI is impressive, yet not overdone, the music still remains gripping, but most important of all, I actually care about the characters and what lies in store for them in Deathly Hallows: Part 2.<br /><br />Here's my ranking of the seven films thus far...<br /><br />1. The Prisoner of Azkaban<br />2. The Goblet of Fire<br />3. The Sorcerer's Stone<br />4. The Deathly Hallows: Part 1<br />5. The Chamber of Secrets<br />6. The Half-Blood Prince<br />7. The Order of the Phoenix</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Best Superhero Movie Ever"></head><body><p>Spider-Man 2 is one of the best sequels ever and the best superhero movies ever.  Heck, it's one of the best movies too.  Though it's no <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAA">The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48SG">2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, and it's not even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQJAIW">Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977 & 2004 Versions, 2-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a> but it is one of the best comic book adapations ever put on the screen.<br /><br />The DVd features much of what the first did.  There's still two commentaries and plenty of featurettes, but there's other must have goodies you need to check out.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="the past is gone, the future isn't here yet..."></head><body><p>-- a partial quote from Bill himself; Don, in the movie.<br /><br />He chases these women from the past that he was involved with and asks all of them (except the one who hated that he showed) a series of questions when all he wants to know if he had a son he doesn't know about (with them).<br /><br />He searches and searches, as a series of events happen; he visits a long haired blond woman, who isn't home at the time. Her daughter is, however. She's very ditzy, but open. When she goes to answer the phone, and Don gets up to look at some pictures to help him find out more about the family, she comes back, stark naked, and doesn't even act like Don's there. Maybe she forgot or didn't care. Either way, she was beautiful.<br /><br />Most guys will go wild for this scene. She just turns, continues to talk on the phone and exits, going into another room or upstairs...(can't remember, wasn't paying attention to that!)<br /><br />The next lady he visits, after having no luck with the last is an animal communicator.<br />"Are you an animal psychic?" Don asks.<br />I laughed.<br />"No." she politely, yet seriously chimes. "I'm a communicator." she says, with a smile.<br />Then the cute cat is let in, and eventually Don asks,<br />"Is he saying anything?"<br />"Yes." she says. "He says that you have a hidden agenda." which was true.<br /><br />She lets the cat out and then as Don persuades her to walk him to his car, they walk out and at the car she doesn't tell much. All we know is that she was married and had one kid; a female who was only 16.<br /><br />Don searches and searches but you will have to watch it to see the ending and what he finds out.<br /><br />3.8 stars.<br /><br />End note: The quote was taken from the end of the movie...the movie was decent though. It kept my attention mostly, and turned out fine.</p></body></html>

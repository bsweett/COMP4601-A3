<meta name="summary" content="Great Neeson performance in a strange, compelling outdoor thriller"></head><body><p>Liam Neeson's determined performance - one of his best - anchors THE GREY, one of this year's more memorable cinematic excursions to date. Viewers who might've missed director Joe Carnahan's film in theaters ought to check out the picture on video.<br /><br />Carnahan, who adapted a book by Ian McKenzie Jeffers with the author, has fashioned a gripping account of a disparate group of Alaskan oil drillers who crash in the frozen wilderness and are subsequently attacked by a pack of hungry wolves. It's essentially a frigid "Deliverance" but with some poetic passages as Neeson and his fellow survivors dig themselves out and try to stay alive, occasionally stopping to deliberate on the meaning of life, the existence of God and why in the world these starving hunters won't give them a break.<br /><br />Atmospherically shot in British Columbia and filled with memorable set-pieces, "The Grey" is exciting and well-executed on nearly every front, save for some occasionally spotty uses of CGI. Still, Neeson's gritty performance says it all: his John Ottway might have been dealt a few bad hands, but the character opts to go down fighting, and the film's spirituality adds depth to a picture that, even on just a pure surface level, ranks as one of the more compelling outdoor-adventure yarns in recent memory.<br /><br />Universal's Blu-Ray looks terrific with its 1080p transfer and sounds even better with a marvelously mixed DTS MA soundtrack layered with surround activity. Extra features aren't overwhelming - just some deleted scenes and a commentary by Carnahan - while a DVD and digital copy round out the release.</p></body></html>

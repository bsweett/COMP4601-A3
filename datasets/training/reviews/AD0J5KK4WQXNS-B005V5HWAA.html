<meta name="summary" content="Dark Costner in a dark drama"></head><body><p>Kevin Costner usually plays the good guy or at least a little bad, but never have we seen him be a monster, and the change turns out to be a refreshing jolt in the somewhat flat serial killer genre. In Mr. Brooks, Costner goes from the wealthy family man stereotype to hideous fiend in a flash. You have never seen Costner like this and never in a film that lets the sets spray red.<br /><br />The story is about the mild-mannered family man and wealthy entrepreneur Mr. Brooks who harbours a dark secret double life as `the thumbprint killer' (beastly played by William Hurt). He kills young couples in their bedrooms to satisfy his ferocious hunger for murder. Even though he has managed to abstain for a number of years, through alcoholic anonymous group therapy, he returns to his nasty misbehaviour only to be caught in the act by a wannabe killer who blackmails Brooks into taking him on a murder spree. Demi Moore appears as the detective who has devoted her life to tracking down the thumbprint killer. A third killer emerges on the scene to make things even more complex.<br /><br />It is a very good story for the most part and there is a subplot involving Brooks' daughter possibly committing a murder. The interplay between Costner and Hurt is very interesting but maybe the film leaves a few loose ends untied but nothing detrimental to what is a well above average thought provoking well acted violent drama. Makes you think Costner should have done bad much earlier.</p></body></html>

Along with a nosy newspaper reporter (Paltrow) and with some help from the one-eyed commander of a brigade of British fliers, Joe tracks the machines across the world.  Joe's weapon of choice: a P-40 Hawk tricked out with all sorts of James Bond type gearJoe links the machines with a mysterious scientist named Tottenkopf, and a mysterious plan called "The World of Tomorrow".  Can Joe solve the mystery before...well before it's too late?<br /><br />This was an immensely disappointing movie.  Virtually everything in "Sky Captain" is borrowed from somewhere else - from the "Indiana Jones" movies to the Fleischer "Superman" animated shorts of the 1930s; from "Flash Gordon" to "Jurassic Park", from "The Wizard of Oz" to "Far Horizons" - so that you spend less time enjoying the movie, and more time combating a stiff case of deja-vu.  When it isn't regaling you with its grasp of other films, TV shows or comic books, "Sky Captain" tosses you generic CGI combat scenes - like those between Joe and a squadron of flying robots through midtown Manhattan, or Angelina Jolie and her squadron up against the robots below the waves of the Pacific.  Rather than transitioning from one scene to the next, "Sky Captain" just jumps into different famous movies - even the identity of the mysterious Tottenkpf is a form of homage.  The special effects aren't all that special - though the CGI seamlessly blends live-action with computer animation, the overall effect breathes less life into the animated parts than simply turn it all into a big cartoon.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Remake Offering a Terrific Guilty Pleasure..."></head><body><p>Remakes usually surface like the bubbles in a bathtub, with an expected reeking sensation.  However, this remake is rather amusing, even though it does not measure up with the original.  The cast is decent and the story amusing without much greatness to be pondered, which leaves the audience with an enjoyable cinematic experience that is worth a viewing and several laughs.<br /><br />In football, individuals put in hundreds of hours over the off-season in the weight room to get into ideal shape and the team polishes its plays to perfection through countless hours of preparation by coaches and players.  Despite all the preparations, one single mistake could break the whole situation, which could possibly result in a loss, or injury.  This in turn could have a downward spiraling affect on the team as a whole and affect the whole season.  Thus, when it happens, the coach is usually in the face of the player to make sure that it never happens again, as mistakes are what separate the winners from the losers.  This is why football is the ultimate team sport. In the testosterone pumped remake The Longest Yard, Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler) embodies the mistake of all mistakes in a football career, as he is sent to prison for the theft of his girlfriend's Bentley.<br /><br />Paul Crewe destroyed the valiant notion of hard work and dedication that surrounds football some years before the film takes place by shaving points in a football game for personal gain.  In disgrace, Crewe has withdrawn from public life while his girlfriend, played by Courteney Cox Arquette, flourishes in exposure.  This personal conflict between the two leads the drunken Crewe to steal her car, as she has it reported stolen.  The combination of alcohol, smart mouthing, and the car theft among other things lands Crewe a lengthy prison term in the Texas penal system.  Crewe ends up in Texas due to Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) who has pulled some strings to have Crewe sentenced in his prison, as he wants to win the Texas penitentiary league.<br /><br />When Crewe arrives to the prison, he quickly learns that both the guards and the inmates do not desire his presence.  This is also one of the reasons why he declines to help the Warden, as the guards are disgusted by his past in the professional league where he was appointed the most valuable player.  Immediately Crewe sets an example through which he acquires some respect, but it also means that he must help the warden.  He finds himself suggesting that the guards should play a tune-up game against some bad players, which gives Hazen the idea of a game between the guards and the inmates.<br /><br />At first, some inmates join up with Crewe, but there is a severe lack of talent among the prisoners and many of them are suspicious about Crewe.  Eventually, some talent emerges out of the secret hiding places and offers services to the team.  Many join the team to get a chance to repay the guards for years of humiliation and pain.  With the help of former Heisman winner Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds) and Caretaker (Chris Rock) Crewe has four weeks to prepare this rowdy bunch into a well-oiled Mean Machine that will be ready to stomp the guards.  However, it is not a painless journey for Crewe and company, as they face much adversity from within the prison while the heat begins to build up for a game that is beginning to gain national attention.<br /><br />Once again, Peter Segal partners up with Adam Sandler with whom he made Anger Management (2003) and 50 First Dates (2004), but it is not where Segal began his career directing comedies.  It is clear that Segal possess the skill of delivering decent comedies, yet much of the humor in the film is unoriginal and recognizable from other films.  Despite the formulaic approach, Segal succeeds in creating an entertaining concept that works and offers both humor and drama.  Some of the success might be due to that the film staying close to the original by Robert Aldrich from 1974 with Burt Reynolds.  Whatever it is in the film that makes it work, it ends up creating a story of trust, unity, and loyalty, which emerges in one of the least likely places in the world - prison.</p></body></html>

You see, his "fixture" below the waste has a big cancerous tumor on it, which will be the ultimate downfall of The King.<br /><br />Or will it?<br /><br />As Elvis lies in bed, using his bedpan, hoping for an erection, or just wasting away, strange things begin to happen. A weird cockroach (actually a scarab) wanders the halls of the old folks home. And following the cockroach is a cowboy-boot-and-cowboy-hat-wearing mummy! What? Not only that, but this mummy survives by sucking the souls out of the elderly population in Elvis' care facility. I mean, who's gonna notice if a few old geezers die off unexpectedly, right?<br /><br />Enter JFK (yes, he's still alive too, but has been dyed black and his brain removed for reasons of national security), who stumbles upon the secret of the ancient, soul-stealing creature. This mummy was being shown around the United States in the 1940s, but the bus transporting his body crashed into a nearby river, and the creature was freed from his sarcophagus. Uh-oh.<br /><br />Can two washed-up American icons beat Bubba Ho-Tep?<br /><br />****************************************************************************<br /><br />This is one of those films that you just HAVE to see to believe. If you've come this far in my review, I have no doubt struck your interest (or, at the very least, some form of morbid curiosity in you.) So let me tell you a bit more about this film's machinations.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell (aka The King of Camp) stars as Elvis Presley. Elvis didn't die on the toilet, but instead had traded places with an Elvis impersonator in hopes of getting back to his roots. But a fall off of a stage ended the real Elvis' days and put him in a convalescent hospital, while the fake Elvis (masquerading as the real King) is the one who dies of a drug overdose. So, of course, no one believes Elvis is Elvis, just thinking he's some crazy old coot who would've liked to have been the King of Rock-n-Roll.<br /><br />This is Bruce Campbell's ultimate roll. It is the character he was BORN to play. Looking at him and the extensive make-up he wears (over two-and-a-half hours worth every day of the shoot), it's often hard to see the actor and not the character. Mr. Campbell's moves, voice, mannerisms, and looks match that of an aging Elvis so well that suspending believability was easy.<br /><br />And speaking of suspending believability ...<br /><br />A lot of you may be asking "How the heck can you believe that a black man is JFK?" It is possible. But only when someone as strong as Ossie Davis plays the character. Let's remember, this is the same actor who gave the eulogy at Malcolm X's funeral.<br /><br />Although this film has been called many things (campy humor, mummy comedy, Elvis-mummy-horror-drama-comedy, etc.), to me it clearly defies categorizing. While there are definitely some laughable moments, especially when Bruce Campbell uses old Elvis cliches (i.e., "Don't make me use my moves on ya, baby!" etc.), there are also some incredibly dramatic shots that make you think about those that live in care homes around the world, and how families often throw their unwanted elderly into them. Early on in the film while Elvis is lying in bed, he watches the world move by him in super-fast speed, drugged up on medication or his mind just not caring what happens. We also get to see his roommate pass away and his roommate's daughter come to collect his things. It was the first time Elvis had seen her in the many years that his roommate had been his roommate. A terrible and truthful exposition on today's society.<br /><br />It's also worthy to note that the film's speed is slow to get moving. And thankfully so. The build-up within the characters' lives was key to gaining understanding and empathy toward JFK and Elvis. So when we see Elvis (Bruce Campbell) using a walker throughout the film, but moving his hips like Elvis, it becomes both poignant and hilarious at the same time.<br /><br />I also need to mention that, although Bruce Campbell is the king of campy films (Evil Dead, etc.), this film was a giant leap forward for him. As I watched Bubba Ho-Tep, it was often times difficult to relate to it as "campy". It really didn't feel that way at all.</p></body></html>

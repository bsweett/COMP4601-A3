His muscles lax; he had no friends, let alone adoring female companions; and more importantly he didn't love his job. In this regard, Pierce Brosnan successfully portrayed the tough, burnt out, lone assassin who had serious reflections on his career dilemma in Mexico.<br /><br />In came another troubled man, Danny (Greg Kinnear), a traveling salesman whose career revival hung on the success of a deal. Thus began the improbable relationship of two lone men, whose characters and professions could not be more further apart. What happened at the backstage of a spectacular bull fight was no less exciting than what took place in the arena. Yet good times did not last long and the scene stopped with Julian at the hotel pounding Danny's door for reconciliation. The catch was we did not know what immediately happened after that!<br /><br />Months later, Julian popped in Danny's home in Denver and asked Danny to do something incredible to secure his retirement. Was it blackmail from an assassin or a favour expected of a good friend ? One's left guessing. All I can say was that when I thought I knew what happened, the story went the other way with an intriguing twist.<br /><br />While Pierce Brosnan succeeded in shaking off any remaining trace of 007, Greg Kinnear impressed with his sincerity and naturalness as a decent man. It explained why he had a devoted loving wife (Hope Davis) despite the unfavourable circumstances. He added a fine human touch and comical sense ( a subtler Jack Lemmon) to his character.<br /><br />The lines were well written. In just a few lines, we understood how deeply Danny and Bean loved each other. We also knew Danny was as much a friend in need to Julian as Julian did Danny. The jigsaw pieces fell nicely to their places, but not until the last minute. Despite some foul language, this is a fine and subtle movie emphasizing love, lasting relationship and support.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly funny and even good natured."></head><body><p>I thought this would either be a "oh laugh at the retarded race car drivers" movie, or worse a Larry the Cable Guy exercise in xenophobia and fart jokes, but it's surprisingly funny with Will Ferrell's Ricky Bobby going through all the ups and downs of the tragic hero (with the final up of the emerging superhero - we are America after all). And Sacha Baron Cohen was brilliant in not so much parodying the French but American attitudes toward the French.<br /><br />But sociopolitical subtext takes a backseat to the fact that everyone in this thing is just so weird and they play it straight enough that it comes out. You've got Gary Cole as the drunken father trying to motivate his son with a live cougar. You've got Sacha Baron Cohen proclaiming that the French invented democracy, existentialism and oral sex. Then later he's waxing poetic about training komodo dragons to perform Hamlet, and he does it so well. There's of course John C. Reilly who FINALLY got his own vehicle with Walk Hard and Will Ferrell holds it all together. Oh and the one race car technician reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0689841582">Are You There God? It's Me Margaret</a> to Ricky Bobby while he's in a coma - Hilarious.<br /><br />I had pretty much written off all the absurdist comedies including Will Ferrell's after the Scary Movie franchises wouldn't get off my television. But thankfully I bought this one for cheap and gave it a chance. It's a fun movie. Plain and simple.</p></body></html>

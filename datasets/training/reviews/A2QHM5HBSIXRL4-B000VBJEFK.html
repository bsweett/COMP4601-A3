<meta name="summary" content="No surprise that 'Ratatouille' put French audiences on their feet"></head><body><p>'Ratatouille' ranks, in my mind, as the best Pixar film since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN4W">The Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>.  It's no surprise that writer-director Brad Bird, possessor of long-standing Disney roots, shaped and directed both of these masterpieces.  It's also thrilling to know that 'Ratatouille' earned not only the respect, but also the glowing admiration of both the French public and its gastronomic elite.  This is a movie that took the time to get the details right and present the French in their rightful role of world leaders in culinary achievements.  If you doubt that, watch the DVD extra with Thomas Keller (a consultant to the film) and note how all his career- and idea-forming experiences were all based in France or of French origin.<br /><br />'Ratatouille' is a movie that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults.  In fact, it seems - by a long stretch - to be the most adult-targeted of all Pixar's works to date.  For example, critic Anton Ego's pronouncements (fleshed out with an amazing voice characterization by Peter O'Toole) are something that would fly 100% over the head of your average eight-year-old.  The single best scene in the movie is when Ego tastes Remy's Ratatouille and is immediately transported into a warm reverie of his mother's similar dish.  That scene gave me goose bumps.  Fantastic stuff from Brad Bird and the whole Pixar team.</p></body></html>

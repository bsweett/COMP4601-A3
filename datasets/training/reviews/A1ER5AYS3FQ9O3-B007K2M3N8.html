Obviously a labor of love, the movie is not without some flaws but Kevin Spacey is such a superb, riveting actor that you're likely to overlook any slight imperfections and be entranced by this movie. I've bought just about every book and video about Darren (including some rare video footage) and I'm awed at the way Spacey captures Darren's essence -  his personality, his perfectionisn, the whole package. Clearly aware of the limited time available to him, Darren pushed himself to the brink of exhaustion and probably shortened his life even more - but oh, what he accomplished while he had the time!<br />  Put this on your list of "must-see" holiday films, one that has to be see on the big screen. This one ought to catapalt Spacey's reputation even higher...and deservedly so.</p></body></html>

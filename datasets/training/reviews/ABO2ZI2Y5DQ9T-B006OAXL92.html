<meta name="summary" content="Martin Scorsese's Love Letter to the World of Cinema"></head><body><p>On the surface Martin Scorsese's latest film "Hugo" appears to be a family-oriented adventure film about a boy named Hugo following his dreams. In fact, "Hugo" is more like the director's love letter to cinema of old (silent movies) and new (3D technologies). And it is a very passionate one. If you remember Martin Scorsese's dedication to the movement of film preservation, it is not surprising.<br /><br />Having lost his father in a fire, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is brought to the station by his uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), a clock maintainer with a bottle in his hand. While living alone inside the walls of the station, Hugo dreams of fixing an old automaton, the only thing that connects the boy to his dead father, but to do so he needs a heart-shaped key. One day he meets the very person who literally holds the key, a girl named Isabelle (Chlo? Grace Moretz).<br /><br />Set in the 1930s Paris, the story of "Hugo" slowly leads us to the past of one aged toyshop keeper and Isabelle's godfather played by Ben Kingsley. We eventually come to know who he is, uncovering his buried past memories through the eye of Hugo.<br /><br />This means you are invited to the spiritual journey of an orphan boy Hugo, but Scorsese's film is not about him; Hugo is there, together with incredible coincidences and contrived storyline, so that we can share his experiences of revisiting what is once thought lost, the cinematic imagination of Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, through the world of state-of-the-art special effects.<br /><br />Thus "Hugo" is not an adventure film. If you think story is slow-moving and dull, and characters flat (with two exceptions Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s and his wife played by excellent Helen McCrory), that is because the real star is not Hugo; it is cinema of old days, recreated by the newest technologies. Since I like old films (my favorite is Buster Keaton, though), I give four stars, but I also think paying more attention to characters of Hugo and Isabelle, and narrative structure is not a bad idea.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Don't Be Scared Away By The Title"></head><body><p>Okay. Granted...most of you are here because you are a fan of this terrific cult classic. But for those that are unfamiliar with this flick, don't make the same mistake that I made almost 20 years ago now when I first thought about renting this at my local video store.<br /><br />The mistake I made was not renting it. It was the title of the movie that scared me away...the word "evil" to be matter of fact. I was sure that it was just one of those poorly acted shock-value festivals of "evil" people, zombies, whatever, doing really mean, torturous things to others. Well, I finally rented it sometime in like 1989 after it was on the shelves for a year, and, boy, was I wrong about thinking that this would be a bad movie.<br /><br />The flick starts out with a guy and his girl heading to a supposedly deserted cabin in a remote forest. And the horror and hilarity then begin. Upon first view, I didn't even realize the deliberate humor that was going on until the infamous hand possesion. Henrietta's appearance then makes for a good scary several minutes, and is then lightened to one of the most humorous moments in horror film history...let's just say it's eye-popping.<br /><br />There are chills and laughs all throughout this classic, even on the second, third, etc viewings. I suggest that you will watch more than once, because, as with me, once you realize this is as much a comedy as it is a horror flick, you will want to look for the jokes that you might have mistaken previously for campyness.<br /><br />A must for any film collector.</p></body></html>

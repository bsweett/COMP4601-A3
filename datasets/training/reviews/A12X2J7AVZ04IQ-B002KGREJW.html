Ms. Breslin's and Mr. Arkin's Oscar noms speak for themselves, but Kinnear, Carrell, Paul Dano and, especially, Toni Collette are so in touch with their material that Ms. Breslin's only task is to be reactionary, which she does beautifully and naturally. I HATE bad kid-actors and she won me over. There's fire and wisdom behind those beautiful, spectacled eyes, and when she lets loose at the end, you simply HAVE to cheer. I'm glad it won the Ensemble Cast award at SAG, though I doubt it will win Best Picture at the Oscars, if only because the directors weren't nominated. The clever screenplay of Michael Arndt may be its only chance of a win. Dysfunctional families have inundated our films lately, but I can't think of one recently that had me believing that such families could be as entertaining. Indeed, the plot is outrageous, pitting one obstacle against another, but the ending is satisfying and appropriate. "Little Miss Sunshine" is a small, easy to watch film, and though some previous reviewers were offended by the foul language, I thought it was representational of the characters' state at the moment. Yes, people do talk like that a lot. Lighten up, folks... I had a good time, and laughed a lot. I also felt for the characters, something I can't always say. Due to its popularity, it almost screams for a sequel. I hope they leave it alone, and let it stand by itself. Further interventions into the lives of these characters might be overkill.  UPDATE: I love Eddie Murphy, but I'm glad Arkin won the Oscar. His foul-mouthed outrage is remembered more than the sweet moments he had with Ms. Breslin.</p></body></html>

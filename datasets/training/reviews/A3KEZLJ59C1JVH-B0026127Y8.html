"Taken" is an outstanding, suspenseful, action-packed thriller about Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), a former international spy whose teenage daughter is kidnapped while on an overseas trip with one of her friends. Bryan hurries to Paris and uses all his old spy skills to track down the creeps who have taken his daughter and plan to sell her into prostitution.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the film by giving away too many details, so let's just say that "Taken" is an awesome movie! You'll be sitting on the edge of your seat the whole time. Watch this one today!<br /><br />(P.S. I heart Liam. He ROCKS in this movie!)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="You Can't Help But Laugh, But It's No Breakthrough"></head><body><p>This is a thoroughly insane movie. A lot of fun, a lot of in-jokes, but completely insane. (People who know me understand that I mean that as a compliment.)<br /><br />A lion, a zebra, a hippo and a giraffe are all friends who live in the Central Park Zoo in New York. The zebra dreams of living in the wild, which somehow he gets mixed up with Connecticut. So he breaks out and finds his way to Grand Central Station to try to get a train to Connecticut. His friends have to go and find him and bring him back before he gets in serious trouble.<br /><br />Of course, this lands them all in serious trouble. They are to be shipped to Kenya. They are in crates on board a ship, stacked on the deck. But their crates fall overboard and they find themselves washed up on an island which turns out to be Madagascar.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a troupe of penguins who were equally dissatisfied with the Central Park Zoo have hijacked the ship and . . . well, I did tell you it was insane, didn't I? Now do you believe me? It's a lot of fun, and the grownups will laugh their heads off at the subtle jokes while the kids have a great time on the broad and obvious ones. Just don't look for anything more profound than friends have to stick together. That and for a carnivore who hasn't had anything to eat for awhile, even his friends will start looking like thick, juicy steaks.</p></body></html>

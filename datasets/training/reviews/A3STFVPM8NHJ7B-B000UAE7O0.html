Lots of big name stars who didnt really seem to gel with the type of movie. Fergie? come on. Dont look for the meaning of life in this film. Just action, gore, and a few laughs. I was bored during the middle of the film but the end was pretty over the top. They say on the back cover one of the most memorable screen heroines ever. Considering she is that for the last fifteen minutes, id disagree. It was cool character but not something i'd watch a awhole movie about. Pretty good if you just want senseless killing and lots of blood.</p></body></html>

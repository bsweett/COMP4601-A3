From the mind of Alex Proyas, director of "The Crow," comes the twisted tale of a world that is anything but what it appears to be. In a city without light, everyday people go about everyday tasks, leading everyday lives, completely unaware of the puppet masters who are pulling their strings. Deep beneath the mysterious city lies an underground world of manipulation and exploitation, as alien creatures from parts unknown carefully reconstruct and rearrange the lives of their pitiful experiment subjects above, the human race. One man shines as a beam of hope for the victimized humans, but only another man can show him the way. Rufus Sewell plays John Murdoch, the miracle man with the ability to "tune" the world around him the same way "The Strangers" do, and who has suddenly become aware that something about his world is just not right. As lost and out of place as the rest of his kind, marked with false memories of a life he never lived, and in danger of being given a whole new set of memories if he is captured by the agents who pursue him, John is forced to find a new escape route at every turn as he attempts to discover the truth about the Strangers and the Dark City.<br /><br />Dark City is sci-fi film noir at its best. As dark as a movie can be without becoming lost in its lack of light, Dark City paints a perfect picture of a society lost in every other possible way. Rufus Sewell is excellent in the lead role, but Kiefer Sutherland is the man that steals the show with his creepy portrayal of a "Peter Lorre meets Claude Rains" scientist walking the line between good and evil. Jennifer Connelly, back when she looked more stunning than weary, is fantastic as the sultry nightclub singer who holds the glazed look of someone unfamiliar with her own life. William Hurt is equally superb as a man thrust into the role of a classic noir detective trying to figure out what is real and what is madness, even from the mouth of his now disturbed partner, played wonderfully by Colin Friels. Richard O'Brien, Ian Richardson, and a host of cronies, even some terrifying children, give nightmare inducing performances as the emotionless "Strangers." And this wouldn't be a classic Monty Moonlight review if I didn't mention the character of May the prostitute, played by Melissa George. I would not be at all surprised if her picture was printed next to the word "gorgeous" in an illustrated dictionary somewhere; absolutely breathtaking. One cannot forget the city itself, either, which is as much a character as any human actor onscreen. The filmmakers have done a wonderful job here of blending various 20th century decades to create a world that seems very familiar, but somehow is not.<br /><br />Dark City on DVD has a nice bit of extras. Most interesting are the comparisons to Fritz Lang's 1926 German Expressionist film, "Metropolis,"  and the commentaries by film critic Roger Ebert and the creators of Dark City. There are also some set design galleries, a theatrical trailer, Neil Gaiman's views on the film, cast and crew bios and filmographies, and some sort of interactive game that I was clueless about. In this case, however, the extras are incidental. This film on its own is a work of art that belongs in every film buff's library!</p></body></html>

Unbeknownst to them, the dead hunter was "implanted" with an alien embryo, a "chestburster".  However, unlike previously known Alien warriors, this one has distinctly Predator features.  When the "Pred-Alien" is unleashed, the Predators' ship crashlands in the Pacific Northwest, its cargo waiting to visit terror on the unsuspecting inhabitants of a small town....<br /><br />The most tragic thing about this horrible film is that we at the Rotten Review went into it with very low expectations.  Before our pessimism could be proven on target however, AvPR actually began showing potential.  That's right - AvPR could have been good, dare we say, it could have seriously rocked, become that fabled movie to rival "Aliens" on countless internet forums.  Here was an Alien movie that was willing to go the distance in escaping the confines of what we know to be an Alien movie.  The 1st Alien in '79 was set aboard a futuristic starship, crewed by professionals who at least knew how to start looking.  Successive sequels had characters who were informed, had their own technology or simply lazy scripting.  Here however, both Aliens and Predators are completely unknown - what a great way to jumpstart at least one of the two franchises here.  There's no 'Face-Hugger Wiki" for the heroes to log into.  The setting is also promising - the vast forests of the Pacific NW and the remote towns that dot it.<br /><br />It's all downhill from there.  Despite the millions doubtlessly spent to produce this movie, there's not a sign of a penny to be found on screen.  There isn't a single identifiable character in this movie, not even the doomed ones.  The story was so poorly paced, we began to wonder if, by some error, we were simply watching somebody (a nooby) play the game version of the movie.  The action scenes are horribly filmed - it's almost impossible to undertsand what's going on.  Between fast camera work and poor lighting, it's impossible to identify the "Predalien" among the other aliens.  The plot is so nonexistent, it's like the writers were annoyed by their own story.  The real mystery is why it was made - it doesn't appear that anybody was the slightest bit interested in the story.  The ending is stultifyingly simplistic - the kind of thing the main characters could have figured out in the first 20 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />A few problems with the direction that AvP has taken - at least the Alien franchise.  AvP unwisely explores the school of thought that Alien chestbursters develop according to the characteristics of their unfortunate hosts.  The problem with this is that if the Aliens seen up until now were patterned according to us, and the Pred-Aliens blow that away, then previously-seen Aliens must be the wimps of the Alien universe.  Sure, they're tough on us, but that's because we human beings are losers.  Stacked up against Aliens burst from more serious chests, and even those guys are history.  If the Pred-Aliens are so much more challenging, then why didn't the Predators ever find a way to make them - it's as if they chose the wimpy aliens.  The story never fills the plot hole of why the Pred-Alien is so much tougher when its host relied heavily on high-tech weaponry and invisibility (admittedly, this is a conceit underlying all Predator stories - for all their technlogy, it's a miracle that they don't have the physique of a teenage xbox champion.  Also, how the Predators missed the Pred-Alien to begin with shows that these guys are just idiots with funny costumes - they could have written this movie.</p></body></html>

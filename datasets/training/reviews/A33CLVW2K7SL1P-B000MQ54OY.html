Their list of issues is nearly identical to mine.<br /><br />There's only a couple of things I would add.<br /><br />Why did the Adelie penguins speak with a heavily urban Hispanic accent? Of all that made no sense in this film, that reigned supreme. (You also might wonder why Lovelace has a name like Lovelace when others have names like Ramon. And why, if all they give him is pebbles, is he so fat?)<br /><br />Penguins with heavy English or Scottish accents (the elders of the Emperor penguins) were closed minded idiots.<br /><br />You can't have multiple accents in a film - especially when one accent represents blindness, the other open mindedness - and not be making a comment. Yet I'm perfectly certain that the producers of the film were NOT making any kind of social commentary whatsoever based on the distribution of accents. That's what makes it so puzzling.<br /><br />That and Mumble's name (the other Emperor Penguins had "normal" names), and his blue eyes - again, something that no Emperor Penguin shared - that used to be cute when Elijah Wood was a child actor but are either mesmerizing or freakish, depending on how you look at them.</p></body></html>

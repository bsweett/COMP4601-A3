<meta name="summary" content="Shake & Shimmy Edition: FANTASTIC extras!"></head><body><p>I avoided this movie like the plague; why was it necessary to remake John Waters' classic movie?!? And John Travolta as Edna Turnblad?!? Well, I was right on 1 out of 2 counts. This movie does a great job of creating its own niche; the songs are catchy and the performances are excellent...except for Travolta. Donning a fat-suit, although he looks grotesque, he doesn't capture the tired run-down housewife look made legendary by Divine. On top of that, Travolta chose to sound like Carol Channing and sounds totally out of place. I do have to give the guy snaps for his dancing though; even in a fat suit he tears up the dance floor. Still, his performance is the one part of the film that really detracts; you believe that Nikki Blonsky is Tracy Turnblad...she wants fame, fortune, and believes in herself; you don't believe Travolta as Tracy's mother Edna; nor do you believe that Travolta is doing anything other than a wink-wink-nudge-nudge to the audience. Michelle Pfeiffer is incredible...not only does she look amazing, she gives an ultra-sleek villianess quality to Velma Von Tussle, the former Baltimore Beauty Queen stuck in a time-warp of when she received her crown (by sleeping with the judges, so noted in one of my favorite musical numbers of the film). Pfeiffer needs to sing more often, as does James Marsden (playing Corky Collins), who seem like he just stepped out of a Rat Pack movie. The voice, the moves...this guy did his homework. The rest of the performances are letter-perfect as well; casting deserves a gold star for this one (other than the Travolta mishap; nice idea, poor execution on his part). For those that don't know the story, Tracy seeks fame, fortune, and a hot boyfriend (Linc, played well by teen idol Zac Effron) on the popular 1960s Baltimore dance TV series, The Corky Collins show. Along the way, she must battle Velma Von Tussle, who wants her daughter Amber to be the star and Linc's girlfriend. Although Tracy is plump, she wins everyone's heart with her singing, dancing, and positive personality. She also helps integrate the Collins show with a little assist from Queen Latifah, another singing/dancing powerhouse in this movie. The colors are very saturated in the movie...this thing looks like a candy-box; a true treat for the eyes, and the sound is excellent too. Turn up that surround sound and sub-woofer folks! You'll be dancing in your living room.<br /><br />I do highly recommend the Shake & Shimmy edition; loaded with extras, New Line doesn't pull a Paramount on you...they give indepth featurettes. One of my favorites are the set of featurettes documenting the history of Hairspray ("You Can't Stop the Beat: The Long Journey of Hairspray"); from the original movie starring Divine, to the Broadway Musical, and then the current version on the Big Screen. The producers, Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, discuss how they were instrumental (pun intended) in bringing back the movie musical, which was considered box office poison not so long ago. It is sad to view Divine finally getting a chance to break into mainstream movies and then tragically passing away not long after the release of the original Hairspray movie. You also get featurettes on the choreography, hairstyles, set design, and costuming for the movie. Be sure to catch Penny's dress in the finale; it is made from her bedroom curtains, complete with valance and curtain rings at the hem. It is a little funny to see rehearsal footage of every major star in the movie except for Travlota. The extra "Hair Extensions" shows you the behind the scenes of the dance numbers; rehearsal footage is cut into the actual finished movie footage, providing an interesting glimpse of the work that goes into each number. "Step by Step: The Dances of Hairspray" teaches you how to do the Peyton Place dance, done expertly in the movie by Elijah Kelley. Although the pacing is a little quick for an actual dance number, you could really pick it up with this featurette if you watch closely and rewind it a few times. As always, it is interesting to watch the deleted scenes, but nothing shown  here is really missed from the film; the editors made the right decision. Karaoke fans can also sing along with the movie using the lyric track.<br /><br />Overall, 5 stars for the extras, and 4 stars for the movie. Other than JT, the movie is flawless until the end, when it falls into a "let's wrap this up quickly" predictability and silliness that betrays the somewhat serious themes of the film (bigotry and self-image). However, it's hard to be cynical when watching the rowsing musical finale. Get this version today!</p></body></html>

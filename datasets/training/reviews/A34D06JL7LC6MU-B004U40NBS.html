<meta name="summary" content="The Most Profoundly Moving Film of 2010"></head><body><p>Black Swan is one of the year's most acclaimed films, nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture. Watching it the first time I found it overrated and inferior to its companion film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TOD92C">The Wrestler</a>. Watching it a second time, I found it to be one of director Darren Aronofsky's most focused efforts. His skill and maturity as a director continues to grow and progress with each film and while it's too early to say if Black Swan is my favorite film by the man it may be his most impressive feature yet.<br /><br />Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers, a dancer at a New York ballet company. It's the beginning of a new season and the first production is of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. With the former star Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) being cast out, the director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) must find a new dancer that can embody both the White Swan and her evil twin the Black Swan. Nina is dedicated to her craft, a perfectionist who knows every move perfectly. Newcomer Lily (Mila Kunis) is her opposite; free-spirited and effortless. Thomas knows Nina can dance the White Swan, but he's not sure she would able to convincingly dance the Black Swan. When Thomas finally casts Nina as the Swan Queen, she becomes so intent on perfecting her role that she begins transforming into the character (and what an amazing transformation it is).<br /><br />Nina is a fascinating protagonist; an innocent and sexually repressed character living with a sinister, domineering mother (Barbara Hershey). Nina's fragile mental state is immediately apparent and the film being told from her perspective makes us always question whether what we're seeing is reliable. A portrait of a slow mental breakdown is nothing new in cinema, but it's the adventurous way it's handled in this film that makes it so special. Aronofsky obviously derives some inspiration from Roman Polanski, particularly Repulsion with its portrait of female sexual repression, but Black Swan doesn't descend into a retread of earlier material. It's an example of a film being culminated from various influences to create something very new and fresh.<br /><br />Natalie Portman has received the majority of notice for her performance, but everyone here is worth mentioning. The stunning, beautiful Mila Kunis, in her first legitimate dramatic role, is perfect as Lily. Her character is a big part of the film, but one of the less complex roles. Still, she's a convincing opposite to Portman's Nina. Hershey is highly underrated doing some career-best work as Nina's mother. This is a stunning performance by an actress we don't see much of anymore and, in a less competitive year Hershey would've been a sure thing for an Oscar nomination. She brings such nuance to the simultaneously caring and overbearing mother role, making her loathsome yet sympathetic. Vincent Cassel is essentially playing the only male character in this film and he plays the charming, amoral, Svengali-like Thomas with a flamboyant subtlety that is brilliantly controlled and convincing. He's been accused of hamming it up, but I didn't get that impression. It's an Oscar-worthy performance that was unfortunately overlooked. Even Winona Ryder makes an impression with little screen-time.<br /><br />Portman will win the Academy Award this year for her performance as Nina Sayers, not as a sympathy vote or to award her for her time in this industry, but because she gives a remarkable, psychologically complex performance and pulls it off flawlessly. Portman so completely captures Nina's fragility, innocence, and elegance while bringing her through a haunting and memorable transformation that never feels over-the-top or forced. She's so in control of her performance and, physically, she's gone out of her way to look the part as well. Already small, Portman lost 20 pounds for her role as Nina. It's a sympathetic performance of a complicated character. Nina isn't the greatest female protagonist of 2010, but Portman gives the greatest female performance of 2010. With more roles like this, Portman could establish herself as a force to be reckoned with. When Nina says "I was perfect," you agree because of the job Portman has done here.<br /><br />The cinematography by Matthew Libatique is very tight, emphasizing close-ups on the face, while giving the film a very raw feel. The film has a visual style that almost completely mirrors the grainy, muted look of The Wrestler, but Black Swan is a much more beautiful film. The hypnotic opening scene is so instantly intriguing it takes hold of your interest and leads you through the rest of the film. The terrific, sometimes terrifying makeup and beautiful score (which does incorporate much of the Swan Lake ballet) all lend beautifully to the tone created by Aronofsky.<br /><br />Black Swan is not an easy film as it doesn't comfortably settle into any particular genre. It has the elements of a horror film and a psychological thriller but never quite falls into either genre, despite having many wince-inducing scenes. It has a European sensibility, evident in Aronofsky being influenced by Polanski's Repulsion and The Tenant and that might not sit well with some audiences. Other people may flock to the movie due to the highly publicized scene between Portman and Kunis (you know which one I'm talking about) which is neither gratuitous nor graphic and has supernatural element that may disappoint viewers hoping for something much more "arousing."<br /><br />For me, Black Swan really achieves greatness in the final 20 minutes which I found to be some of the gripping, powerful, and fascinating minutes of any movie from 2010. Even when using CGI effects, Aronofsky manages to simultaneously evoke emotion and challenge the viewer. Few films move me to tears, but Black Swan did even while knowing what to expect. Yes, it took a second viewing for me to really appreciate this film but I found myself blown away by it. It's an amazing film, a brilliant companion piece to The Wrestler, and an emotional rollercoaster ride. Black Swan is the most profound, moving cinematic experience I've had from a 2010 film. It's less of a film than an experience.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

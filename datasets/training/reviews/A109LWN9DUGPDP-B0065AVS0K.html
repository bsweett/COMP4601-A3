<meta name="summary" content="not what I hoped for/ whats that high pitched sound in diolouge?"></head><body><p>I really thought this was going to be a pretty good one and it was going to take alot to convience me it wasnt great about less than halfway through it hit me this is not so good and thats how it was all the way through best way to decribe violence,nudity,weird and i like all of those things in a movie if done well,but this movie was i cant belive i would be saying this about this movie but boring.The 3 separet storylines didnt really intersect so it was never really intresting i was very disapointed I will give it three stars for originallity with the comic book look.I watched it on the DVD a was able to get an early copy(legally) just about every time someone speeks there is a high pitched ringing kind like when you have your ears checked its not my sound system was wondering if some else may have noticed this sound throughout the movie it is annoying.RENT especially if there is a special edition coming soon</p></body></html>

The quality of the film transfer on this edition is excellent and a real pleasure to watch. The shadows, shading and the attention to detail of the enhancement from the previous versions, is stunning.<br /><br />2. This movie has more memorable scenes than probably your own wedding ceremony. Also, this is probably the most quotable movie ever made and one of the greatest.<br /><br />3. The sound is pretty even throughout, there's no drop-out's or places where it comes across to thin.<br /><br />4. The extras on disc 2 are interesting and enough to give first-time viewers a better understanding.<br /><br />5. A really fantastic film for any age, first-timers or repeat offenders. I watch this movie every Sunday, and have done so for about the last 10 years. We look forward to it over here and never tire of it.<br /><br />6. Humphrey Bogart is absolutely magnificent and unforgettable as Richard 'Rick' Blaine, but Claude Rains does have all the best lines.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />1. Roger Ebert's commentary on this is dry, dull and sounds as if he's reading from an essay, rather than speaking about the film candidly as it progresses. I can read this same information on the internet or in a multitude of books, with greater insight. I would've preferred a commentary track from Lauren Bacall over this anytime.<br /><br />2. This sound is only offered in PCM 2.0 and could've been presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 had they wished to invest the time and money. Maybe they will remaster it on the Blu-Ray version when it's released.<br /><br />3. Ingrid Bergman's line "Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him ..." still bothers a lot of people, and even driven some away, which is too bad. It's a shame that during a period of great inhumanity, a little more humanity couldn't have been more equally distributed. Ingrid Bergman should've have been more aware ... but who's to say?</p></body></html>

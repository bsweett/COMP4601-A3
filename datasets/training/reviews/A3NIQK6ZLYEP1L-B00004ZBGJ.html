<meta name="summary" content="Classic movies!  It's a Madhouse, a madhouse!"></head><body><p>This collections not only has all the Ape movies but also a bonus disc "Behind The Planet Of The Apes".  These movies are great, dealing with racism, war, sexism and basic human stupidities.<br /><br />The list of great actors who are in these movies are endless - Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Linda Harrison, Mauruce Evans, Natalie Trundy, Bradford Dillman, Eric Braeden (a great actor I love who also starred in "The Forbin Project"),Hari Rhodes, John Huston, Claude Akins and even Paul Williams (the singer).<br /><br />The star power plus the great themes and plots just add to the cool special effects that made the movies great and still make new fans out of latter generations.  Tons of extras also add to the value of this collection.  If you don't have the movies or never seen them THIS is the set for you.</p></body></html>

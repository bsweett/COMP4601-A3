<meta name="summary" content="A Tough Subject to Tackle"></head><body><p>This awful event has shaped American history in the first decade of the new millenium.  You cannot get around that.<br /><br />Then comes the entertainment industry.  How should this most memorable event be depicted for both "documentary" as well as dramatic purposes?<br /><br />On balance, despite some obvious potential for criticism, this movie does a good (but not great) job.  Treading a constant tightrope between bathos and mock-documentary fact, the movie ends up telling the story fairly well.  After seeing it, what sorts of conclusions does the viewer reach?<br /><br />1.  As a nation, we were not at all ready for this attack.<br /><br />2.  The attackers are zealots but human.  Our enemy is more like you and me than we'd like to admit.<br /><br />3.  Americans don't have to accept the inevitability of their fate.  We are a brave and autonomous people, and we have a lot to be proud of.<br /><br />My personal conclusion, aside from deep sorrow and deep admiration for the heroes of this movie, is that each of us is marked by how we treat other people.<br /><br />I liked the film, even though I would not call it a great accomplishment.  To those who see it as exploitation, I'd say watch the movie first and then judge.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An imaginative tale needs an imaginative director"></head><body><p>"Alice in Wonderland" is an imaginative tale that demands to be told by an imaginative director.  Who better to fit the bill than Tim Burton.  The world he creates is a vivid one full of wonder.<br /><br />In this version, Alice is a 20 year old who feels oppressed by an unimaginative society that wants her to act like a proper lady at the expense of her individuality.  When she falls down the rabbit hole into another dimension, that dimension looks wildly different but still carries expectations that others want her to meet without question.<br />The challenge for Alice, then, is to challenge these automatic expectations and find her own identity.<br /><br />I enjoyed Tim Burton's take on this tale, but not so much the actors.  I know Burton is infatuated with Johnny Depp, but I'm not so enamoured.  I thought Depp could've been more animated playing the Mad Hatter and was surprised he played it so low key.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter played her character low-key, too, which is also surprising given she got the juicy role of the Red Queen.  Instead of screaming, "Off with her head", she said it in kind of a bored tone.  She did look funny having a oversized head to match her oversized ego, but I always expect the Red Queen to be menacing and there wasn't anything menacing about how Bonham Carter played it.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway plays the White Queen and really overdoes the delicate hands in the air, floating across the stage, bit.  And newcomer Mia Wasikowska plays Alice in a lackluster way that demanded more energy than she was willing to give.<br /><br />As far as which age bracket this movie would be best suited for, I think it would be better suited for older kids and up.  There were some scenes that could be too scary for little kids. For instance, there's one scene where a creature's eyeball is torn out of its socket and another scene where Alice walks on top of the heads of the Red Queen's beheaded victims.  Also, this movie runs a bit too long so I don't think little kids could wait it out.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, though, I still enjoyed watching Tim Burton's imagination at work.  I also like the message that if having a vivid imagination makes you mad, then perhaps that's actually a blessing in disguise.</p></body></html>

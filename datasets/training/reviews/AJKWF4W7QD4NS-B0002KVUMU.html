Hugh Jackman stars as the monster hunter Van Helsing, teamed up with a princess (Kate Beckinsale) and a loyal friar (David Wenham from Lord of the Rings), sent to Transylvania to stop the count from unleashing a horde of bloodsucking offspring.  Some spots of the film are deliciously campy, while others stick out as plain dull.  The opening is a wonderful homage to the classic Universal monster films, and buffs of classic horror will find plenty of references and homages in the film.  The special effects are some of the best CGI seen today, and Van Helsing is more satisfying than Sommers' Mummy films, although underneath the break neck pace and special effects there isn't much left to it.  It's still worth seeing and it has a bit of a surprising ending, and a sequel is almost virtually inevitable.</p></body></html>

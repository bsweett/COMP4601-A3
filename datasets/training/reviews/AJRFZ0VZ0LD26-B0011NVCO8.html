<meta name="summary" content="American Progress during Vietnam War"></head><body><p>Film based on the real character, black gangster from NYC area who was distributing Blue Magic drug in late 60s and early 70s.  It is a story of a man driven to succeed in the only trade he knew, at any price.  He uses Italian Mafia tactics and employs his immediate family and cousins to help him with distribution.  The genius of his channel distribution is that he has arranged for drug delivery via MP transport between military bases on the US east coast and Vietnam where the war was fought.  As he pushes competition away with his superior products and takes away cut from the middle man that happens to be NYC Special Investigation Unit, he starts building enemies, slowly but surely.  The moral of the story is that this man, Frank Lucas, no matter how ruthless is the picture perfect of the American Dream.  He works hard, he is driven and dermined and has his goal.  He becomes someone that white people have to recon with.  But at the end, his empire is like a house of cards where he takes NYC police department, his family and himself down to the dungeons.  His wealth and success are not saving him from the justice system where he spends 15 years of his life before he can be free again.  Wonderful cast and a great story.  Many of the support actors are from HBOs shows like "Deadwood" and "Wire", they look worn out, raw and full of supressed anger - fantastic characters.  Great movie.</p></body></html>

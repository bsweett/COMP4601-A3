<meta name="summary" content="Galloping Tadpoles!  A Different Look in this Korean Monster Flick!"></head><body><p>The Host<br /><br />Not really sure what to expect, and seeing mixed reviews made me hesitant, but director Bong Jooh-Ho put together quite the monster movie show.<br /><br />The American stereotype and environmental message hits you with a sledgehammer right out the gate.  A doctor decides to ignore rules and protocol and orders a South Korean assistant to dump gallons of formaldehyde and other noxious chemicals down the drain, after all the river Han is "wide."<br /><br />The monster, kinda like a galloping tadpole, except it's huge, starts out eating beer cans and then raises his diet to South Koreans.<br /><br />We also meet the family that gets most involved, which is what the story is really all about.  The central focus on a different group, like in Cloverfield, is different than your usual "slow reveal" of the monster.<br /><br />Like in Cloverfield, the military and the medical communities are running things, despite protests and where the cure is worse than the disease.  Reflective of the SARS epidemic, the governmental cover-ups and both American and Korean screw-ups are clearly evident.<br /><br />The whole dad-son connection and their search for their child was heartbreaking and I was disappointed that the end didn't give us more hope.  The doctor and medical scenes were frightening - but how did the son survive a drill bit to the skull?<br /><br />He breaks out into the middle of a barbeque!  Funny stuff.<br /><br />And how the monster gets killed by a few ragtag citizens rather than the Korean army (which seemed more interested in martial law than getting the monster) was interesting and unfortunately a probable response.<br /><br />Different, groundbreaking, certainly not formulaic.  A bit long in its two hour showing, though.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AEX8KU">Memories Of Murder [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Denmark </a>]<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001V7RTAU">Tokyo!

There are many things to appreciate about this kind of film: it's an inspiring Rags to Riches story with a main character who must overcome adversity if he's to succeed. It also reinforces a number of life lessons that many have yet to learn. However, something different needed to be done if the intention was to actually impress me; yes, this film is inspiring, but so is "Working Girl," "Cinderella Man," and "Erin Brockovich." This kind of film has been made many, many times before, and frankly, it's getting tiresome.<br /><br />So why am I giving it four stars? I suppose because, as worn out and cliched as this story is, it at least has some decent performances and a good message. And it delivers exactly as you expect it to: if you want a feel good film, you've got a feel good film. I'm sure those of you who aren't as jaded as I am will be reduced to tears by the plight of Gardner, played in the film by Will Smith. He overcomes a number of difficult circumstances, ones that many wouldn't be able to handle if they were in his place. Living in San Francisco in 1981, Gardner tried his hand at selling bulky bone density machines to hospitals, thinking that such a technology would be preferred over traditional x-rays. Unfortunately, most of the hospitals considered them to be unnecessary luxuries and weren't willing to invest.<br /><br />As a result of slow business, Gardner and his family are in a financial crisis: their rent is months overdue; they owe the IRS; and they can't rely solely on the wife's income. How fortuitous that he should pass a man getting out of his Ferrari. "What do you do and how do you do it?" asks Gardner. "I'm a stockbroker," replies the man, pointing to the building they're both standing next to. He also says that you don't necessarily have to go to college to be a stockbroker; you only need to be good with numbers and good with people. This inspires Gardner to apply for the internship program at Dean Witter. He's offered a position (aided by his ability to solve a Rubik's Cube). Despite the fact that he'll receive no salary, and despite the fact that he's down on his luck, he accepts the offer, believing that if he can work through the internship, something better will come along.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's too little too late in terms of his wife, Linda (Thandie Newton). Years of financial strain have pushed her to the breaking point, and she decides to leave for New York. Of course, she wants to take their five-year-old son, Chris, Jr. (played by Smith's real life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith), but both she and Gardner know that she can't care for him. Thus, Chris is left with his father. This suits Gardner just fine; early on, his voiceover narration says that he didn't meet his real father until he was twenty-six, and that no matter what, he would make sure his children knew who their father was.<br /><br />For most of the rest of the film, it seems as if everything will continue to go downhill. For one thing, he can no longer afford to pay his rent, meaning he has to leave his apartment. He and his son move into a local motel, where he pays half of what he paid for rent. But then the IRS finally catches up with him, taking over six hundred dollars out of his bank account. He's left with just over twenty dollars, which is not nearly enough to pay for their room. This paves the way for one of the film's more devastating scenes; with nowhere else to go for the night, they lock themselves in a subway bathroom. The impact of the scene is heightened by the fact that someone continuously rattles the door on the other end.<br /><br />The effectiveness of this scene depended on its originality. I say this because the rest of the film is unflatteringly run of the mill. At one point, when shooting hoops with his son, Gardner says, "Don't let anyone tell you, you can't do something. Not even me. You want something, you go for it, period." It's a fine sentiment, certainly, but haven't we heard such sentiments before? And consider the character of Alan Frakesh (Dan Castellaneta), the Dean Witter employee who trains the new interns; while he never talks down to Gardner, he does ask him to do degrading menial tasks, such as getting him coffee, buying him donuts, and re-parking his car to avoid the street sweepers. I can't help but wonder if he was included merely as a counterpoint to Gardner's good spirit; are villains of these kind required in such films?<br /><br />Nonetheless, I was moved by Gardner's tenacity, which is another reason why I went ahead and gave the film four stars. He clearly doesn't know the meaning of the word "quit," which is one of the best attitudes to have in life. Even when forced to wait in long lines to stay in homeless shelters, he refuses to settle for what he has been dealt. He's determined to make a better life for himself and his son, which is difficult considering Chris, Jr. doesn't completely understand what his father is going through. He's merely a boy of five, with a basketball, a little multicolored backpack, and a Captain America figurine in his possession. There's no denying that the kid is as cute as a button, which is probably what enabled me to look past the heavy-handedness of his line, "You're a good papa."<br /><br />I don't think there's any question of whether or not Gardner overcomes adversity; the real life Christopher Gardner is now a multimillionaire in his own firm. The fact that he succeeded clearly makes his story inspiring, and for that, I'm recommending "The Pursuit of Happyness." Still, I got the sense that this film adaptation altered the story to make it more appealing for a mass audience, which resulted in a number of tried and true elements that have long since worn out their welcome. It can't be a good thing when a five-minute segment on "Oprah" is more interesting than a two-hour film; Gardner told Oprah his childhood Christmas Day experience. While he was taking a bath, his abusive stepfather stormed in, held a gun at him, and told him to get out of the apartment. Naked and wet, Gardner was left outside on a freezing December night. That kind of material would have made more of an impact than the material in "The Pursuit of Happyness" did. Unfortunately, I'm forced to settle for yet another feel good tearjerker.</p></body></html>

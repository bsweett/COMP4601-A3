Go read a Heinlein, Card or Cherryh book, you will be happier. If you want to turn your brain off for a few minutes, this movie is a lot better than I imagined it would be. Charlize is beautiful. The action isn't half bad, and the special effects are really quite good. The story is... well it's not exactly literature, but as I said if that's what you are in the mood for, there are lots of great books out there.<br /><br />If you are standing at the video store asking yourself, Aeon Flux or UltraViolet? Rest assured Aeon Flux is your better choice. This film is not "Aliens" by a long shot, but it isn't half bad. Just turn off your brain and enjoy!</p></body></html>

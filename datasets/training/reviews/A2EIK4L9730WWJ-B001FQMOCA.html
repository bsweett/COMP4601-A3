<meta name="summary" content="WALK THE LINE DELIVERS AND AWESOME PERFORMANCES BY JOAQUIN AND REESE!!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>Walk the Line tells the story of Johnny Cash and also his beloved wife June Carter Cash..... The movie is awesome and wonderful performances by Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash..... The movie deals with Johnny's drug problems and when he sang for inmates at the Folsom Prison..... I truly think that this movie told a little bit about the man in black,but forgot some of his storyline so you would have to watch the E True Hollywood Story..... I think that this movie should have won best picture at the awards,but it didn't..... I think that this movie is a must watched movie and if you love Johnny and June's music then you should check this one out it is worth it!!!!!!!!!!</p></body></html>

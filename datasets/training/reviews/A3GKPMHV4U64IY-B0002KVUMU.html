<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Good"></head><body><p>I was really expecting a schlocky summer film when I heard of this one.  After buying it and watching it I was quite surprised to discover that it was really quite good.<br /><br />Van Helsing, Gabriel and not Abraham from Dracula, is a mystery.  He was found on the steps of Saint Peter's with no memory.  He was then enlisted by a society that protects the world from evil.<br /><br />We first meet Van Helsing as he confronts Mr. Hyde at Notre Dame Cathedral.  After that mission he is sent off to deal with Dracula, a vampire.  This is not Stoker's Dracula, but an interesting new creation.  This time Van Helsing is given a guide who's character offers a lot color to the film.  He must stop Dracula before a certain family line is extinguished.<br /><br />Well, it wouldn't be a good movie if everything went as planned.  With werewolves, vampires and the legacy of Frankenstein running through the film Van Helsing is kept very busy and the audience entertained.  There are some points that seem to have been lifted right from The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen but it is mostly fresh and original.  We see a good number of Universal's classic monsters in a whole new light (we miss the Mummy, Invisible Man, and the Creature especially).  The action is typical these days after things like Buffy, Xena and Charlie's Angels but it seems handled differently.<br /><br />If you like action, monsters, and good vs. evil then this is a movie to watch.</p></body></html>

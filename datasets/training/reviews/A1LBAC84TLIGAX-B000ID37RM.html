<meta name="summary" content="BORING, JUST LIKE THE FREAKING BOOK! 4.5 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>Much like the book, I didn't like this movie because it was just so boring and unexciting. The characters are as uncompelling as they were in the book and I really felt no compassion for the social injustice tragedies that were in the story because of how boring this movie and the book are. There is almost no excitement to be derived from this shamefully bad movie, the storyline is just groan-worthy, the characters are groan-worthy, the premise is boring, the fight scene at the end was lame, and just about everything else was lame, just like the terrible book. This isn't one of the worst of the worst films I've ever seen (That distinction is for Happy Feet and Like Mike). If you think I'm some kind of racist because I hate the book and movie (Much how people think I'm atheist because of my review for The Bible Game) you're wrong, because I'm not. This movie just sucks along with the book because they're just so freaking boring! Avoid this movie please, if you truly like movies.</p></body></html>

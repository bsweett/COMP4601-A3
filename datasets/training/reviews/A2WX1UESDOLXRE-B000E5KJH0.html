This is a decent movie, but it's kind of slow and, well, just plain boring some of the time. And some of the time, you might just want to gag at the thought of a girl who sleeps with the same playboy that her mother and grandmother have also slept with. Yuck! I don't care if the playboy is played by Kevin Costner!<br /><br />Aniston plays Sarah, who is engaged to Jeff (Ruffalo) and living in NYC. Sarah has always felt like the oddball of her family. She's not quite blonde. She hates tennis. She has nothing in common with the people of her hometown, Pasadena. Her little sister is getting married, and even though Sarah is happy for her, she still feels out of place. That's when she begins to piece together the biggest mystery of Pasadena: Who exactly was the inspiration for the movie The Graduate? When she discovers that it was HER family, she goes on a wild goose chase to find the real life Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman's character in The Graduate). Turns out, that Benjamin Braddock is actually Beau Burroughs (Costner), and Sarah begins to wonder if there are genetic reasons for her familial displacement.<br /><br />This movie might not mean that much to you if you haven't seen The Graduate. Too much emphasis is put on this other movie, rather than the writer, directors, whatever actually focusing on THIS movie. Hell, it might not mean much to you if you have. It's an intriguing premise, but the whole let's-use-the-movie-The-Graduate-as-a-tag-to-get-people-to-see-this-movie, isn't that great of an idea. But still, if you like Aniston, Costner, Ruffalo, or MacLaine (who is the best part about this movie, aside from Ruffalo's goofy cuteness), check it out. RECOMMENDED.</p></body></html>

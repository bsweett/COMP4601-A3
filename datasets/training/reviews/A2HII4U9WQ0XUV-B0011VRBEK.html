<meta name="summary" content="Better to remain silent and be thought a Fool..."></head><body><p>Than to run your mouth, remove all doubt, *and* be locked up in a seedy back-alley dungeon, imprisoned for no reason, with no explanation, by an implacable, mysterious, shadowy foe, entirely bent on your destruction and insanity.<br /><br />Such is the fate of our hero Oh Dae-su (Min-sik Choi, in the role of a lifetime): a buffoon, a drunken Korean businessman loaded up on too much booze and a night of excess, busted by the police, booked into jail, urinating in a corner of the police station, barely bailed to freedom by his old friend Joo-hwan---and who, seconds later, on a busy Seoul thoroughfare, outside a phone booth, minutes away from his wife and infant daughter---disappears.<br /><br />Without a trace.<br /><br />Without a trace to his family and friends, perhaps---but certainly not to his tormentors. For Oh Dae-Su awakes in confinement, in what appears to be a seedy flat in a seedier tenement, confined, imprisoned, given no answers, provided food and water, and gassed each night for the Cleaners to make---ahem---'adjustments'.<br /><br />It's enough to drive a sober man stark-raving mad, don't you think?<br /><br />It's even worse that Dae-su, entombed as he is in the guts of the City, cut off from any explanation---why is he here? when can he get out? who has done this? My God, jailer, won't you talk to me?---panicked, hopeless, desolate---is nonetheless in contact with the outside world: through television.<br /><br />Call it his book of days. He sees the days stretch into months, the months stretch into years. He hears the news report of the atrocious, brutal murder of his wife, her throat slashed at the hands of a shadowy brute, his infant daughter whisked away into the protective clutches of anonymous Officialdom.<br /><br />A happy man, one instant: a Prisoner, the next.<br /><br />Years pass, and then the greatest trick of all: Dae-Su is released. Sprung. Baptized atop an office tower, sprung from the womb of an oversized suitcase, left to find his own way, bereft of family, life, place: suspected as the murderer of his wife, years ago. A Man without a face, without a name, without a country. With one thing, and one thing only: Revenge.<br /><br />Oh, and a cell phone, and a wallet full of money, passed to him by a nameless beggar who claims to know nothing: hungry, tired, dispirited, Dae-Su tears through a pack of thugs---all that karate +-practice in his lounge-lizard-prison having paid off handsomely, evidently---checks into a juke-jive, bites the head off a squirming, hapless octopus, and meets a sweet young thing---Mi-Do---who is instantly horrified, and compelled.<br /><br />And then the real fun begins.<br /><br />Now: it would be unfair to say much more about "Oldboy". It is a stark, searing little testament to the power of guerilla filmmaking, a laurel wrapped about the head of its creator, Chun-Wook Park, who has managed to graft high style with a weird kind of cinematic poetry, an elegiac cinematographic high style, married to a sere, haunting, neo-classical soundtrack (with snippets of Vivaldi): all of it builds up to a crescendo that is nothing short of catharsis. It's an exhausting film: it makes demands.<br /><br />The cinematography is its own character here, as is the direction: there is a kind of wild elegance, in the rain-swept streets of Seoul, of the spare interiors, of the weary, craggy, hell-beaten topography of its hero's face, seamed with bewilderment and agony. The battle sequences---there are a number---are kinetic, yes, but for all the high style, feel real: you can feel the skin buckling, the bruises forming up purple-yellow, the sullen exhaustion of the combatants.<br /><br />And beyond and above it all is the central question: what is Vengeance? Who is the Avenger, and what is avenged? The acting---from Choi to Hye-Jeon Kang (Mi-Do), and all the supports---is supple, and completely compelling, adding to the grandeur of this shivery little tale of grue and moral kurare: ultimately the big reveal is more devastating for its precision---its preciseness, its measured planning---than anything you might have expected.<br /><br />Brace yourself.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GREAT MOVIE! HOPE A DVD UPGRADE IS IN THE WORKS."></head><body><p>MARTIN SCORSESE'S GOODFELLAS IN MY OPINION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES EVER. BUT THE DVD WAS GIVIN' ONE OF THE WORST TREATMENTS. I BECOME APPALLED WHEN I'M WRAPPED UP IN A HELLA GREAT MOVIE LIKE "GOODFELLAS" AND I'M INTERRUPTED BY HAVING TO FLIP THE DVD LIKE SOME 1980's LASER DISC. I AM SURE THAT A SERIOUS UPGRADE IS COMING SOON. NOW ABOUT THE FILM ITSELF... IT WAS NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE IN 1990. GOODFELLAS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES... GREAT PERFORMANCES ARE ALWAYS FOUND IN A SCORSESE'S PICTURE, NO EXCEPTIONS HERE. ROBERT DE NIRO, JOE PESCI & RAY LIOTTA ARE THE LEADS AND THEY ARE ALL IN TOP FORM. THE SUPPORTING PERFORMANCES BY LORRIANE BRACCO & PAUL SORVINO ARE ALSO VERY CREDITABLE. SAYING THE LEAST "GOODFELLAS" IS THE BEST MOB MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! SO WITH THAT BEING SAID, I SUPPOSE THIS DVD WILL DO FOR NOW. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF STARS BASED ON (HAVING TO FLIP THE DVD). SCORSESE'S FILM IS A LEAGUE ABOVE PERFECTION AND SHOULD NOT HAVE IT'S AVERAGE LOWERED BASED ON PACKAGING OR POOR CHOICES ON HOW THE DVD WAS DESIGNED.</p></body></html>

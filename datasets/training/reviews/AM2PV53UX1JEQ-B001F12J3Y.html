I love Christmas and Santa and have actually played an elf in my life.  So why is this expensive movie so hideously off-target?  Because it has no life, and its vision of Christmas and of the North Pole is of a scary looking place that is cold, distant and has no merriment -- a dreary, hellish, Third-Reich of the North.  And for all of the fuss of the CGI wonderment, only the train, with its rollercoaster thrills, comes to life -- the children and people in this movie look like zombies.  The music is either cheesy, over-the-top new stuff (Hot Chocolate, the strangely uninvolving musical number on the train) or classic Christmas songs that play like music in floating through an old radio on the deserted streets of the North Pole - a place as welcoming as a morgue.  It's a heartless vision that virtually drains the magic from the book, which is elegantly spare and has on its mind only one word: believe. This movie is misguided in nearly every way -- calling into question the artistic judgment of those who created it...what were they thinking?  How can you weave magic without caring about someone, or something?  These characters have no life in their eyes -- and it isn't merely the fault of the animation process (think of any of Disney's classics...the characters are more real than some people!)  I'll stick with Miracle on 34th Street as the ultimate believe-in Santa movie, and I still plan on putting the cookies out this year...</p></body></html>

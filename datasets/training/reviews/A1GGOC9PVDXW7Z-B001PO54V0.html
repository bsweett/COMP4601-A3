There's references here to dozens of familiar tunes written by these talented men back in the 1920s and '30s.<br /><br />Kudos to Jean Hagen, who is simply remarkable as the always repulsive, forever screechy Lina Lamont. The character is based on Norma and Constance Talmadge-- Their star-rank careers came to a sudden end with the advent of talkies because both had heavy Brooklyn accents and unpleasant voices.<br /><br />A description here of the movie's most famous sequence, "Broadway Melody."<br /><br />In this extended number, the new-to-New York Gene Kelly enters briskly from stage left. He wears a straw hat, striped jacket and black frame glasses and carries a valise as he gaily calls out the opening phrase, "Gotta dance!" Kelly is then ushered into a fast-paced NY world. He quickly rises from burlesque clown to baggy pants vaudevillian to a tuxedoed gent in the Ziegfeld Follies.<br /><br />Kelly becomes infatuated with the beautiful girlfriend of a gangster (Cyd Charisse in a stunning green gown) and the two perform an elegant fantasy ballet. From here it's all downhill. The small town boy ends up as he started: on the street. Although now clad in a fine suit of evening clothes, the enthusiasm is gone-- he looks mournful.<br /><br />At that moment, another new arrival strides rapidly from stage left. He's dressed just as Gene was when he came to Broadway and he sings out the same "Gotta dance!" Gene's spirits revive. He happily calls back and the production ends on a high note.<br /><br />The entire story is most entertaining and like all great films, it holds up well. The above sequence is nothing less than stunning and if you've never seen it before, you are in for the rarest of treats. Highest recommendation to Comden & Green's SINGIN' IN THE RAIN!<br /><br />This classic musical is also available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006DEF9">DVD</a>.<br /><br />Also recommended--<br />The "American in Paris" suite from the 1951 Gene Kelly/MGM musical of the same name may just be the most beautiful ever committed to film.

The movie is a horror movie, and a good one. While it wasn't as scary as the Shining, and to me because not a lot of unrealistic horror movies, but it still had some freaky moments. I jumped at some and the ending had a great twist. Compared to most modern horror movies, I have to give this 4 stars. The plot is about a woman whose husband has vanished (he's off at war) who moves into a large mansion with her two children who are very unique. They cannot go into the light EVER. (they're like allergic to it in a way) And there's also a mysterious maid and ah yeah, some ghosts. This ghost story had me guessing till the highy unpredictable ending and I was jumping at some parts and freaked out at others. A very good horror movie.</p></body></html>

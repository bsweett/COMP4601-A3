<meta name="summary" content="Just Barely One Cut Above the Rest."></head><body><p>With an unoriginal script full of plot holes, a limited budget, cheesy acting, and a twist (though a cop-out) ending, SAW could have been another washed-up horror movie. Instead, it became the surprise horror hit of 2004, birthed a new killer icon--the Jigsaw Killer, prompted two sequels (so far), earned over $100 million worldwide, and revived the movie career of Cary Elwes.<br /><br />The film opens in a disgusting, dirty, disused, and probably diseased bathroom with two men, Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) chained at opposite ends of the room to pipes by their ankles with an apparent dead man lying between them.  The dead guy holds a tape player and a handgun and each of the men has a tape in their back pocket.  They each play their tapes: one is threatened, but the other isn't.  Dr. Gordon must kill Adam by 6:00 or his wife and daughter will die.  The men discover hacksaws in a toilet, but fail to cut through their chains.  Time is running out.  Meanwhile, Detective David Tapp (Danny Glover) is hunting Jigsaw as the movie flashbacks to scenes showing some of Jigsaw's other victims.  Jigsaw wears a giant puppet head and he never actually kills his victims himself.  Instead, he forces them to kill themselves or to kill each other, the whole time watching his little "game" which he believes is a public service to set people free (think of a psychotic and murderous Tyler Burden from FIGHT CLUB).  Put it all together and it makes for one bizarre movie.<br /><br />Personally, I found SAW to be better than I had expected it to.  The idea of a gamemaster who doesn't actually kill anyone himself but lets them do what he wants them to, is an interesting concept.  Danny Glover is a pleasure to watch on film and it was nice to see Cary Elwes again, even if his performance was terrible.  There's a lot of blood and guts in the film, though much of it has been toned down through editing and lighting, yet there are some things that the filmmakers leave up to one's imagination.<br /><br />Overall, even though SAW is pretty much an average horror flick, it has enough sparks of originality to make it one cut above the rest.</p></body></html>

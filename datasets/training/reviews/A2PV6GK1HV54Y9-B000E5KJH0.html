<meta name="summary" content="Jennifer Aniston is great but the movie isn't."></head><body><p>Jennifer Aniston is a talented actress, i loved her on Friends and in The Good Girl, but i was very disappointed that Rumor has it... did not make me jump for joy. I love Director Rob Reiner as well, he has directed some great films, like Stand by me, When harry met sally, and The story of us, but this film was slow and not funny at all. Shirley McClaine holds this film together but her jokes are kind of vulgar and strange. I wanted to like this film, the trailer was deceiving, it looked like a comedy but it is mainly a drama. Mark Ruffalo and Kevin Coster are superb as Aniston's love interest in the film but the storyline never caught on and after awhile you just don't care if the so-called rumor is true or not, heck even Derailed was better than this. Hopefully Aniston can pick a finer film next time around, this wasn't for her.</p></body></html>

First rule of being in a movie: Never sell your soul to the devil! It never works out. In this Marvel comic made into a feature movie, we follow motorcycle daredevil Johnny Blaze who does sell his soul to make his father healthy again. When the devil comes knocking we learn of the legend of the Ghost Rider; the agents who collect debts (souls) on behalf of the devil. We meet a cowboy who we later learn is also a Ghost Rider. Together they battle an evil being who is attempting to steal souls owed to the devil. An interesting story, interesting characters. Well acted, well photographed and great special effects! My favorite scene is the horse riding cowboy aside Johnny Blaze on his motorcycle both moving thru the desert at night leaving a trail of fire.<br /><br />This is one movie in which I like Nicolas Cage. This is a solid movie that I do recommend!</p></body></html>

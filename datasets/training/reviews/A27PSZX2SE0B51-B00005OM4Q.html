Which is probably why "Almost Famous" didn't resonant completely with me the first time I saw it.  I wanted to fall in love with fictional band Stillwater just as I had Zep.  But I didn't.  On seeing the film a second time, it's not that surprising.  By the its own admission, Stillwater is an average band making good on charisma and hard work and a touch of luck.  But the music is merely a canvas.  The passions of the individuals involved are the paint that makes this movie a great piece of art.  The boys in the band are passionate about the music.  The groupies (excuse me, "Band-Aids") are passionate about the music, and the bands who make it.  The 15-year old rock journalist (and Cameron Crowe double) is passionate about the music and what it takes to write about it.  His mom is passionate about her beliefs and instilling them in her kids.  And everyone is passionate about finding something real to latch on to, to make them, in the end, "people of substance".<p>And director Crowe is passionate about telling this autobiographical tale with energy and sincerity and dignity, but also about keeping it true, exposing the warts and all.  He does so.  Magnificently.  It lives up its pedigree, being superbly written, honestly acted, and insightful to such a degree that it exposes bone.<p>"The only true currency in this bankrupt world is what you share with someone else when you're uncool," says Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) at one point.  It is my favourite line in a script that, even though it lacks a "Show me the money" moment ("I am a golden god," pales in comparison), speaks deeply on a lot of personal issues in a pristine and economical way.  A story that on first glance I found meandering and pointless, I appreciate now precisely because it is meandering and pointless.  We follow a rock band on tour.  What could be more meandering and pointless than that?  On the other hand, when one sheds the veneer of cynicism that adulthood saddles us with, we have to realize that there is nothing more beautiful.  To the people living it, it is Bohemia and Valhalla rolled into one.  Beautiful life and beautiful death.  Crowe's script lets these weighty concepts hang in the air, available for the passionate viewer to latch on to, and come along for the ride.<p>The acting ensemble is led by four (and a half) wonderful performances.  Patrick Fugit, in his first major role, is asked to carry the bulk of the film's innocence.  And he does so with aplomb.  It is an assured and strong performance.  Kate Hudson deserves all the accolades she has received.  However, on my first viewing, I had a tough time appreciating her work, because I was busy falling in love with her.  But now I see that she gets things right most of the time, showing she is able to simultaneously play the spirited sprite and the broken old soul.  I also suspect that she must have given the cinematographer fits, because she seems to be composed solely of a warm, bright light.  She glows.  Frances McDormand, on the other hand, plays the dowdy and domineering mom.  The revelation here is that she manages to enliven her with an odd kind of cool.  I adore everything she does here (and in her other movies), and whatever capacity for crushes I had leftover after my run-in with Ms. Hudson, I gave wholeheartedly to Miss McDormand.  Billy Crudup, as Stillwater's mysterious guitarist, didn't have me convinced the first time around.  But on the second pass, I realize that his is the best performance in the movie.  There's a moment near the end that clinched this realization for me.  He realizes he's been duped, and shows his appreciation for the person who got the better of him with a sheepish grin.  It's the capper in a series of subtle suggestive glances that line his flawless performance.  (N.B. The "half" performance noted above belongs to Phil Hoffman, who, in what amounts to an extended cameo, proves once again that he is incapalbe of giving an unrealistic performance)<p>As for the film's insight, well, I'll leave that for you to discover.  Needless to say it will be more beautiful that way.  I know, I know, this all sounds like mindless hippie drivel, but when I encounter a Cameron Crowe film, I find it very easy to wear my heart on my sleeve.  With pride.  And passion.</p></body></html>

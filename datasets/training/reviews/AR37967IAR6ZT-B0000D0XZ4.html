<meta name="summary" content="Terrible. (SPOILERS)"></head><body><p>HULK was joyless and odd, and the camerawork, with the split screens, at first seemed inventive but just eventually became distracting. (For instance, the death scene of Josh Lucas was just silly.) The daddy stuff was irritating, and the whole "What happened behind the door?" thing was painfully obvious. <p>And shouldn't the gamma accident that unleashed the Hulk pack more of an impact than it did? It seemed largely behind the point. When I think about the Green Goblin creation scene in SPIDER-MAN last year, it was much better done.<p>The worst scene was when David and Bruce Banner were both sent to that platform and spotlighted heavily ... and someone encouraged Nick Nolte to go all Brando, which made no sense. (In that scene, Nick Nolte just looked like he was giving an example of an "angry monologue" on INSIDE THE ACTOR'S STUDIO.) <p>Why on Earth was it so long? Why do you cast such charismatic actors as Nolte, Jennifer Connelly (who's capable of tremendous versatility), the hammy, funny Sam Elliott and Eric Bana (who's a known comedian in Australia) in a film so devoid of charm or humor? It makes no sense.<p>And Ang Lee's made some terrific comedies and heartfelt dramas. Though ambitious in what it tried to do about these characters' emotions, HULK failed to be compelling and was just terrible.</p></body></html>

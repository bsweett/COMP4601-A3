<meta name="summary" content="A vanguard motion picture"></head><body><p>Probably the most unfortunate thing that ever happened to `Citizen Kane' was that it found itself atop the AFI top film list.  Now, no one can simply enjoy the film.  Everyone feels compelled to scrutinize it and make  a decision about its greatness.  Asking whether `Citizen Kane' is the best  film of the century is like asking if Marilyn Monroe was the most beautiful  woman.  It depends on whom you ask.<p>`Citizen Kane' is not the most  entertaining film I've ever seen, but it is certainly one of the most  important.  It is a vanguard motion picture and a gargantuan achievement  for Orson Welles.  If you consider the fact that Welles was a 24 year old  Hollywood outsider who had only done radio and theater when he landed the  contract for this film, you begin to appreciate what a big deal it was.  This was during a time when a few studios controlled every film that was  made. How many 24 year old actor/directors can you name today, even in a  world where independents abound?<p>The story is based on the life of  William Randolph Hearst.  Writer Herman Mankiewicz had an up-close look at  Hearst as he had been an occasional house guest at the Hearst mansion.  The  similarities were striking, right down to the paramour whose career Hearst  promoted, who loved to do jigsaw puzzles.  The fact that this film was  released at all is a marvel in itself.  Hearst went on a personal campaign  to crush the film and enlisted every powerful friend he had to stop it.  Louis B. Mayer offered RKO $800,000 to destroy the print.  John D.  Rockefeller ordered the Radio City premier cancelled.  All of Hearst's  newspapers were forbidden to mention the film.  <p>Hollywood was uniformly  against it and Welles was branded an insolent maverick.  The film was  snubbed by the Academy.  It was nominated for 9 Oscars and won only best  screenplay.  The film turned out to be a commercial failure, losing  $150,000.  With all the forces stacked against it, we are lucky to be  having this best film debate at all.<p>The story has a simple moral; that  money and power can't buy happiness.  We see Kane's progress from a happy  child, to an idealistic young journalist intent on helping the common man,  and finally to a bitter and angry old man whose innocence has slipped from  him.  One of the most effective scenes that illustrated this was the two  minute overlay of breakfast conversations with his wife.  It starts with  cooing lovers and progresses through increasing levels of discord.  It ends  in silence with the two reading separate newspapers, her disdain for him  subtly indicated by her choice of the hated Chronicle as her  newspaper.<p>What is so remarkable about this film is the filmmaking.  Director after director has pointed to some aspect of this film as having  influenced them.  The use of shadows and various perspective shots was not  unprecedented in 1941, but never before had they been used with so much  dramatic impact.  What was unprecedented was that `Citizen Kane' was the  first film ever to depart from the strict narrative format, which moves  forward chronologically.  The film starts at the end and jumps around in  time based upon the perspective of the person who is telling his or her  story about Kane.  So the next time you see a flashback, remember it  started here.  <p>The makeup was revolutionary.  Welles often went through  four hours or more of makeup to be properly aged for each scene.  The film  also launched a number of brilliant careers.  Besides Welles, Joseph Cotton  and Agnes Moorehead went on to long and prominent film careers.<p>If  `Citizen Kane' is not the best film of the century it is certainly one of  them.  Its influence on a generation of filmmakers cannot be ignored in the  equation.  People who watch this film and ask, "What's the big deal?" are  comparing it with modern films that have borrowed from this film's  techniques and undergone 60 years of evolution.  It's like going back to  Kitty Hawk and saying, "What's the big deal, the flight only lasted a few  seconds."<p>There is only one rating to give to a film of such monumental  importance.  It is the consummate 10.</p></body></html>

A must-see!"></head><body><p>Ghost World , a dark comedy about teen angst, serves as an antidote to all those mindless Hollywood teen comedies and/or dramas that sprout up in multiplexes like summer weeds. Be forewarned that this antidote is far stronger than many viewers can tolerate. Consider the tag line that appeared on its theatrical posters: "Accentuate the Negative"<p>Movies about the alienation that some teenagers feel can be traced back fifty years to the James Dean classic, Rebel Without a Cause. Prior to this film, pathologically unhappy kids were always depicted as residents of slums and orphanages. Suddenly, here was a movie that showed kids growing up lost and miserable in a middle-class environment. The idea that the American Dream had a dark side was controversial then. It still is. <p>In Ghost World, Enid and Rebecca [brilliantly played by Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson] are best friends who are just graduating from high school. They're of the super cool, intelligent group that sees beyond the hype and myths of our consumer driven society. As the movie plainly shows, those who see the world too clearly can end up even more clueless than those who see it through a mental fog can. It points out that belief in false values can be more comforting than belief in no values at all. This, of course, presents one of the great conundrums of life in suburbia. <p>Enid and Rebecca's plans for the summer include getting an apartment together. Rebecca is the more realistic of the two. She gets a job and goes about looking for a place for them to live. Enid is paralyzed from seeing little of meaning in her life. Her assessment of the world around her is accurate, but her attitude starts to cause a rift in her relationship with Rebecca. <p>The girls alleviate their boredom by play mind games with people. When they read a pathetic personal ad in the newspaper, they decide to contact the nerdy-sounding guy who placed it. This turns out to be Seymour [Steve Buscemi], who collects old 78 rpm records, hasn't had a date in years, has forgotten how to carry on a normal [meaning banal] conversation, and has made a lifestyle out of alienation. Enid has found her soul mate, but can two such searching souls ever truly bond with another person?<p>Director Zwigoff, who in real life is not unacquainted with alienation, has made an ingeniously original movie. The subject matter may be dark, but it is never brooding. Humor abounds in nearly every scene, although much of it is the kind that some people don't understand or don't appreciate. Too dry, too scathing, etc.<p>Ghost World is based on a famous underground comic book `novel', which may be why the world it shows often seems to be coming from some alternate reality. The place the girls live in exists in its own time and space. Everything's just a little too bright, a little too strange, a little too off center. I liked this odd point of view. It made the black humor more palatable. This city wasn't like the one I live in. Or was it? I couldn't really solve my problems the way Enid did at the end. Or could I? Is her world science fiction, or is the real fiction the world we have created? <p>Some people will always dismiss the problems that cause teenagers who have been given `everything' to see their lives as lacking in meaning. Ghost World  doesn't provide answers or solutions. It does do its quirky best to show us that there are valid reasons why some people see life's illusions too clearly, both in the movie's world and in the real one. It also says that such people are not necessarily as weak as they appear. They can and do go on to lead useful, productive lives. But first they must find their way out of the mess they were born into.</p></body></html>

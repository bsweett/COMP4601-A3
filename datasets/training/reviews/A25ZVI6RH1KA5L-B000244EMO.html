It picked the wrong man"></head><body><p>Now few may know this, but before Arnold Swarzenegger became `The Govenator' of California, he actually starred in a score of action films.  It's true!  Predator (1987), directed by John McTiernan, whose next film would be the hugely successful Die Hard (1988), solidifying his status as the director with the most machismo in Hollywood, stars the great lumpy one (Ahnold), although not quite as lumpy as he was in his first major action film, Conan the Barbarian (1982), along with Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed from the Rocky films), Jesse `The Body soon to be governor of Minnesota' Ventura, Bill Duke (he also appeared with Arnold in the mindless 1985 action flick Commando), and Sonny Landham (Billy Bear in the popular 1982 Eddie Murphy film 48 Hrs.).  There are a few others, but these are main players...along with the Predator, played by the colossal 7'2'' Kevin Peter Hall, who passed away in 1991.<br /><br />As the film begins, we learn some gooberment officials have been captured as their chopper (that's the cool way of saying helicopter, in case you didn't know) has been shot down in some unfriendly country, which, I believe, is somewhere in South America, but they never really specify.  Maj. George Dillon (Weathers) calls in a group that specializes in rescuing captures officials, dignitaries, and so on, lead by Maj. 'Dutch' Schaeffer (Swarzenegger).  Among his team are Sgt. 'Mac' Eliot (Duke), Blain (Ventura), who carries one of the biggest guns I've ever seen, and Billy (Landham), along with a couple others.  The mission?  Go in and rescue the missing men...or so it seems, as later we find out that Dillon knows more than he's letting on, but whatever...the group, with Dillon tagging along supposedly in command, enter the jungle, find the downed chopper, and make some horrific discoveries in that another team had been sent in prior to this one, a highly trained military unit, and only their `skinned' corpses remain.  Now, it's never made clear whether Dutch's group is actually in the military, or an ex-military group for hire, or mercenaries.  Dutch claims they only do rescue missions, which would seem to indicate they are no longer in the military, as you don't really get to pick and choose your missions, but his men still refer to him as `Major' so I don't know...I guess it doesn't matter...as they travel deeper into the nasty, hot jungle, we get the impression they are being tracked.  They find and neutralize the enemy camp, and Dillon's true motives are revealed.  This soon becomes a moot point, as they team begins to lose members one by one as a unseen hostile force starts picking them off.  As they race back to a safe point for extraction (the choppers won't venture in too far as the area is now `hot', which I took to mean the group's presence is known, and unfriendly soldiers are now swarming, looking for this small band), they begin to understand what they're up against is more than they ever could have bargained for, as the elite team of fighters becomes fodder for something not of this Earth.<br /><br />If you are looking for sweaty muscle men with big guns, then you've found your Nirvana here.  The characters never really reach much more than a two-dimensional level, but that's of little consequence, as the name of the game is guns shooting, things blowing up, and pretty much non-stop action.  I swear, I think this film has the most gunfire of just about any movie I've seen, and I've seen lots of them.  Ventura's character actually walks around with a Gatling gun, which looks uber-cool, but hardly the type of ordinance I'd take on a covert rescue mission.  If you don't know what a Gatling gun is,  it usually consists of about six barrels or ten barrels mounted in a revolving frame and fires about 320 rounds a minute.  Overkill?  Maybe, but when it comes to the Predator, they don't hit much.  The battle scenes are exciting, as they're filmed in such a way that puts the viewer into the action, rather than just watching it from the safety of your funky couch.  The dialog may evoke a fair deal of wincing, as it's chock full of macho witticisms, a few examples being, "If it bleeds, we can kill it", or, when a character gets his arm grazed with a bullet, another character says, "You're bleeding!", to which the injured character replies, "I ain't got time to bleed".  If it had been me, I probably would have been on the ground, crying, but then I'm neither cool or battle-harden like the characters in the film.  The Predator costume looks very good, despite the age of the film and the technological advances since, so much credit goes to special effects artist extraordinaire Stan Winston.  All in all, Predator is fairly pure actioneer, with a dose of science fiction and a dollop of horror (the skinned bodies...).  The film and it's makers know what it is, and there's very little pretense to make it anything more than that.<br /><br />The wide screen picture looks about as good as it's going to get, and does show some minor flaws, but the audio seems to have been remastered for a DTS soundtrack as well as a Dolby Digital 5.1.  There's scads of extras, including a commentary track by the director, text commentary, a making of documentary titled "If it bleeds, we can kill it", a section titled `Inside the Predator' which is broken up into seven featurettes proving a great amount of detail, a Predator special effects section with five featurettes, a few deleted scenes and outtakes, a Predator profile, a photo gallery, and even a few Easter Eggs (hidden features) scattered about.  Is this two disc set the definitive Predator edition?  I suppose so, that is until another one comes out, like they did with Terminator 2.  (It's definitive for me as it's more than I ever wanted or needed)<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></body></html>

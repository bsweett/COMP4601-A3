Initially somewhat confusing as to where its focus will fall, Clayton moulds itself into shape about a third of the way in, and excels as a stylish legal thriller.  First-time director Tony Gilroy (scripter of all three Bourne movies) maintains a dependable, vaguely solemn quality throughout, which sits contentedly with a subtle-turn Clooney, and daring hysteria from supporting player Tom Wilkinson (as the senior partner). Fans of the courageous latter work of Clooney will eat this up, as another precarious role for the actor/producer is pulled off with much self-confidence; while Gilroy makes an solid debut as a feature director, and proves himself as one to watch.</p></body></html>

I also appreciate his talent as a director; "Mystic River" is a masterpiece example of his skills in my opinion.  However, I have been puzzled by all of the accolades for "The Unforgiven".  For me it was actually a disappointment to watch after all of the advance praise I had heard.  It IS a good movie but I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more if I had seen the movie before any of it's reviews.<br /><br />The basic story is that of some prostitutes that want revenge on a man who disfigured one of their co-workers.  The town's tough sheriff (played excellently by Gene Hackman) isn't going to do anything about it so the girls offer a reward for someone who will.  A young wannabe gunfighter convinces Clint Eastwood's character to come along and cash in on the bounty.  Along the way they pick up Eastwood's old pal played by Morgan Freeman.  The movie basicly ambles on from there to the ending.<br /><br /> There is a lot of good acting and the movie does its' best to dispel the myths of the Old West by the many characters and incidents involved.  I guess that was the purpose of the movie but in the process of doing so, it seemed to want to displace excitement with boredom.  As a result, it slowed down the movie quite a bit without offering much in drama to replace the action.  Some might say I'm missing the point but I think of "Bridge on the River Kwai" as an example of an outstanding anti-war movie that still appealed to many for all the military action and drama that it offered.  Eastwood's character goes through the movie looking like he's overdosed on Valium.  His climatic finish seems only to have been accomplished by a change of depressants.<br /><br />I said that this is a good movie and I did find a lot to enjoy.  For me the best scenes were those involving Gene Hackman.  His was the strong presence that good Westerns are noted for.  Although he came across as the bad guy, his role made this movie as good as it got.<br /><br />I watched the Oscar ceremonies for 1992 and I cheered for Clint Eastwood to win the Best Actor award.  I was sorry that he didn't because it seemed like this might have been his last chance for the prize.  However, I knew that I was cheering for the actor and not for the role.  I think that the praise for "The Unforgiven" was largely for the man and not the movie.  Watch it and see for yourself.</p></body></html>

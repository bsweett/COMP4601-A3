<meta name="summary" content="Sub-par Sequel. 29 out of 100."></head><body><p>While I am a bit jaded when it comes to horror, the first Saw movie was a pleasant surprise. Saw 2, on the other hand, was junk. I quit halfway through. The acting was horrible, the plot dull, and suspense? Non-existent.<br /><br />The only thing of note in this movie was the intense gore, and that was a bit too much when set side by side with all the things Saw 2 lacked.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 29<br /><br />16 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />3 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br />4 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br />2 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br />4 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br />0 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?</p></body></html>

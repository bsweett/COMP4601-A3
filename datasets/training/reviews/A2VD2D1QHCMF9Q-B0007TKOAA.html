<meta name="summary" content="A slow, irrelevant bore of a movie!"></head><body><p>If wine quality is a metaphor for the lives of these two protagonists, it must be very, very sour wine.  This movie reflected the lives of two less than admirable guys.  One of them starts out by stealing from his mother, and he goes downhill from there.  He is an English teacher, which I would have thought would be an admirable profession, but he seems to hate it.  He has no admirable qualities, none at all.  He goes on and on about wine, and all that meant to me was that wine aficionados are shallow, empty people who specialize in a knowledge which is trivial at best, irrelevant at worst.  The other guy has a little more on the ball, but his last week before his marriage has been less than exemplary.<br /><br />There is no saving grace in this movie.  It moves, ever so slowly, from one boring situation to another, specializing in the frowns and depression of the would-be author and true-life loser.  If I got one thing from this terrible, terrible movie, it is that I will never have any respect for anyone who talks wine . .<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this one.  The only people who can appreciate this tripe are probably those who will not admit how bad it is  . . . trying to pretend there is something here . . . like the people raving about modern art that they will not admit they know nothing about . . when in actuality it was painted by an Elephant or a Chimpanzee.  What a disappointing movie, and waste of two hours!</p></body></html>

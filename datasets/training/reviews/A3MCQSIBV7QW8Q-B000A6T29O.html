<meta name="summary" content="Lara Croft is the greatest Tomb Raider ever!"></head><body><p>Lady Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie), adventurer and heiress, finds a mysterious clock in Croft Manor when it starts ticking on the night of the first stage of the alignment of all nine planets. Lara discovers that this clock will lead her to two triangle pieces that when put together at the exact moment of the alignment of the planets, the possessor will have the power to control time. But she Manfred Powell (Ian Glen), a member of a group called the Illuminati who want to use the power of the All-Seeing Eye, steals that clock from her. It's now up to her with the help of her friend Bryce (Noah Taylor) and later on another 'tomb raider' Alex West (Daniel Craig), to find the two pieces of the triangle before the Illuminati use the power for their own diabolical plot. But Lara herself be tested when she starts having thoughts of using 'time' to be able to be with her long dead father, Lord Richard Croft (John Voight). Will she able to resist the temptation? <p>I was totally impressed by Angelina Jolie with her doing most of her own stunts. I thought that action scenes using the bungee cord was pretty neat. Angelina sort of reminds me of Sophia Loren, you know the big lips parted a little. As for the plot, it was pretty cheesy but still it was entertainment. <p>But the best part of the whole movie is of course the cool action scenes! The four main action scenes are 1) the beginning where Lara is head-to-head against Bryce's robot, 2) where the bad guys are trying to steal the clock from Croft Manor (with Lara giving them a pretty hard time), 3) when Lara 'raids' the Tomb of the Dancing Light, and 4) the finale with Lara and bad guys going into the Tomb of Ten Thousand Shadows. The computer graphics were actually good.<p>As for the DVD itself, it's a pretty good special edition DVD. Plenty of special features, my favorites are the cast and crew interviews, a featurette on Angelina Jolie's physical training for the role, about the stunts, explains about the visual effects that were used in the movie, deleted scenes, and the U2 music video &quot;Elevation&quot;. Of the four deleted scenes, three of them I was happy they had deleted. The one scene in which Powell killed Lara's friend was pretty grotesque. The one they shouldn't have deleted was the one where Lara takes the one part of the triangle from Alex's room. There are also some DVD-rom features.<br /><br />All in all, it was a pretty fantastic movie to watch, enjoyable by people who want to spend two hours at home watching a film which you won't have to think too much but still have fun watching the action. Can't wait till &quot;Tomb Raider 2&quot; comes out!</p></body></html>

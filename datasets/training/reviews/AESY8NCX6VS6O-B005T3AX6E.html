<meta name="summary" content="A Modern Masterpiece - The Best Movie of the Past 20 Years"></head><body><p>The rocky terrain of film in the 1990's can be summed up in one fell swoop with Quentin Tarantino's magnum opus of pop culture, four-letter words, and overlapping time frames. It's a grand journey - two days in the L.A. underworld guided by hitment Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Whitfield (Jackson), boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), and a dream cast of colorful supporting characters (including Harvey Keitel as the mysterious but resourceful Mr. Wolf). And even when the nearly 3-hour ride gets dark and violent, it's impossible to miss the tongue-in-cheek hilarity of Tarantino's colorful and endlessly quotable screenplay ("I'm gonna get medieval on yo' a$$"). Submerged in director Tarantino's deep love of film, it plays like a gift to cinephiles of all ages that thankfully never fumbles into parody or blatant tribute. Instead, Pulp Fiction takes its inspirations and molds them into something entirely original. It restores one's faith in the future of film itself - so much that nothing better has even been seen yet.</p></body></html>

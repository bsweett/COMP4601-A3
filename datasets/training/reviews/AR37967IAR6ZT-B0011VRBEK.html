<meta name="summary" content="OLDBOY is amazing."></head><body><p>I went to see OLDBOY last night, and I'll be damned if it wasn't the best movie I've seen all year.<br /><br />I went in expecting some Asian-style actioner. Instead, it was dark, twisted, visually interesting, violent and pretty much genius.<br /><br />The plot, which I won't divulge much of here since the joy is in discovering what the movie is about, is excellent. The movie's graphic and intense.<br /><br />OLDBOY is based on this manga, so Edmondson and I were expecting some sort of light, funny, hero-driven, martial arts actioner when we headed to it last night. It's nothing like that. Edmondson kept pointing out that he thought it was funny how I wanted to see a "gritty, Asian revenge thriller" about a guy who is imprisoned in an apartment for 15 years for unknown reasons by unknown people - and then, upon getting out of his prison, tracks down his captors for answers.<br /><br />There were moments of violence where I just kept saying to myself, "Dude ... Dude ...," gripping on to the armrest, for it was intense and incredibly clever. And I don't even say "Dude." It was wicked. It was sick. It was fantastic.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.</p></body></html>

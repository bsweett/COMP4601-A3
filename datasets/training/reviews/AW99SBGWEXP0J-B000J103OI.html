<meta name="summary" content="The Devil Wears Prada"></head><body><p>Andy Sachs (Hathaway) applies for the job of second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Streep), the editor of "Runway" magazine.  "Runway" is THE magazine for the fashion industry, and Andy has no fashion sense.  Miranda is revered by all who know her.  She has the power to make or break people in the industry, and she is not afraid to use this power.  Work for her for a year, and countless doors will open.  Of course, others like Emily (Blunt), Miranda's number one assistant and Nigel (Tucci) have become fixtures at the magazine, while waiting for those doors to open.<br /><br />Miranda hires Andy on a whim, hoping she has what it takes despite her appearance.  Andy dislikes the shallowness of her coworkers, but soon finds herself becoming more like them.  Will she get sucked into that lifestyle, or will she me able to resist and remain true to herself?<br /><br />Meryl Streep makes this movie work, and is the prime reason to see it.  She dominates every scene she is in.  She is both cruel and funny, sometimes at the same time.  Hathaway, Tucci, and Blunt are also very good, especially when playing off of each other.  This is definitely a "chick flick", but is entertaining and really funny at times.  Not everyone's cup of tea, but worth giving a shot.</p></body></html>

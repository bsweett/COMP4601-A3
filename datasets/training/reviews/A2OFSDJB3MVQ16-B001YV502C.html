<meta name="summary" content="Alfonso Cuaron gives us a dark future"></head><body><p>If you're expecting a fantasy like "Enchanted", stay away from this film but if you want a cautionary tale of the future like "Blade Runner", check this one out.  This was one of the best films of 2006 and that's due to excellent direction and a steller cast headed by Clive Owen, Julianne Moore & Michael Caine in role inspired by John Lennon. I haven't read the book but after seeing this fine film, I will definitely search it out.  The immigration and the over-population problems shown in this film hit close to home.  I hesitated in seeing this film late at night after work but the reality of this film really woke me up!! This film in HD DVD since after seeing it a second time, I was amazed at the visual richness this film actually has!!  Totally recommended for fans of sci-fi and "Blade Runner" fans (Bush and other politicos be aware of what you're doing to this planet!!) The HD-DVD transfer gives you a "you are there" look too.</p></body></html>

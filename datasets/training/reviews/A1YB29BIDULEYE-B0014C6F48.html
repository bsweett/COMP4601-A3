<meta name="summary" content="More Profound Than We Would Have Guessed"></head><body><p>On the surface, this movie may seem like just another fluff movie. However, giving this movie its fair chance, we soon learn that it is anything but that. Basically, as the movie starts, we are introduced to the 13 year old Jenna Rink. She is unpopular and unhappy. More than anything, she wants to hook up with the 6 'cool girls' in the school. Her friend Matt tries to explain that to her that there really isn't much to admire or envy about the  '6 cool girls.' Matt seems like a nice of enough person, but Jenna doesn't have her eyes on him. Rather, she is after the popular Chris Grandy. After reading some teen magazines, she decides she wants to be '30, flirty, and thriving' just like the people in her magazines. Well, somehow, she gets her wish and 17 years fly by. Not only is she 30, but she has a high paying job that she wanted, and her best friend is (or was)Tom Tom  the leader of the 6 cool girls. She is understandably confused at first, but she soon becomes happy over her wish coming true. To some extent, she is still talking and acting like a 13 year old, but it does make sense. Well, soon the "Bedazzled" formula comes in. (If you saw that, you know as Frasier made his wishes, the devil or Elizabeth Hurley threw some unwanted element in.) Garner's movie is more profound. Jenna gradually realizes that even though she has gotten her wish, she doesn't like the person she has become. To be sure, she 'supposedly' did bad things in the missing 17 years she had no control over. But even in the time as a 30 year old she DID have control over, she gets notably shallow and self centered. Possibly, the most profound aspect of this film is that it exposes the hypocrisy of society. Remember, the magazines Jenna was reading as a 13 year old, filled her with the desires for the wish. And even after Jenna got the wishes that society filled her with, she was really unhappy with herself when she realized the kind of person she became. And the even worse price she may have to pay is Matt. Matt was never really popular, but he held to his important values even though they didn't make him popular. Jenna has lost his friendship; he has gotten engaged to another woman; while he to a generous extent finally forgives Jenna, Jenna realizes that they have become so different. Also, Jenna may have gotten the best friend she wanted. However, she eventually learns that being friends with 'whoever is cool' may not be real. They may be willing to drop you when they realize that your friendship is more dangerous or possibly less beneficial to them. One of the most powerful elements in this movie is that the company Jenna works for is in trouble, and the key to saving her place of employment may directly parallel what Jenna needed to resolve with herself. In all honesty, there isn't a dull moment. And you do walk away feeling like the time spent was enriching as well as entertaining. (RARE FEELING AFTER A MOVIE THESE DAYS!)</p></body></html>

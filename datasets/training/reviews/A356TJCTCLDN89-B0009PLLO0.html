I mean this is in the class with Heaven's Gate and Town and Country. In this movie Alexander the Great is portrayed as whiny, often weepy mama's boy with a complex the size of a mountain about his mean old dad. That's it.  You sit through what feels like several hours of weeping and pychological mish mash. People around me were actually laughing at the movie and it's not meant to be a comedy. Colin looks silly in that wig/dye job and Angelina Jolie as Olympias was ....strange. Val Kilmer gave such a great performance as Doc Holiday that it's sad to see him hamming it up in this movie. I liked the elephants though. If you don't go to a lot of movies pass this one by or you'll be left furious for wasting your ten bucks.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jennifer, your Oscar awaits..."></head><body><p>I can honestly say that I have never been in a theater where so many people were cheering and whistling and giving shout-outs to the actors in my life, and while at times it was entertaining in itself, and at one point down right comical, I've decided that I never want to sit through that again.  I'm the type of guy that likes to watch my movies in silence, so I can get everything the first time and not have to watch it again because I missed a whole scene because the idiot in front of me decided to get out his lighter (serious, that happened).  THAT aside, `Dreamgirls' was a great experience.  While not as great as the hype would suggest, I've learned that to almost always be true and thus forgo the hype when walking through the cinema doors.<br /><br />`Dreamgirls' chronicles the careers of Supremes knockoffs `The Dreams', Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose), Deena (Beyonce Knowles) and Effie (Jennifer Hudson).  Singing together for years they have strived to make it to the top, and one night after singing in a competition and catching the ear of aspiring producer Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx) they get their big break singing backup for superstar James `Thunder' Early (Eddie Murphy).  Effie immediately stands out as the backbone and spokesperson of the group, giving Curtis a hard time about the mere fact they are singing backup.  Her persistence both pays off and in a way breaks her down as Curtis decides to make them stars, moving Deena to the front of the band and in a way moving Effie out completely.<br /><br />The movie succeeds to sheer brilliance when its female costars are acting through song, Hudson earning her soon to be Oscar with her gut wrenching `And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going' while Beyonce blew me away with her equally powerful `Listen' which gave me Goosebumps.  The film has everything going for it, and while it's not perfect, it's not too far off either.  I still feel that some past musicals (`Chicago' & `Moulin Rouge' come to mind) are better films, but what makes `Dreamgirls' so outstanding is that they got the feeling, the singing and the actins spot on.  Unlike say `Chicago', `Dreamgirls' doesn't have ONE bad note in the singing department.<br /><br />This film is one of the better cast films I've ever seen, every acting playing their role to perfection.  Eddie Murphy gave a career best here, Beyonce underplayed splendidly (it was nice to see her not try to be the center of attention, and so for me in a lot of ways she stood out), Anika Noni Rose does wonderfully as the na?ve member of the group, Danny Glover is great here as is Keith Robinson, and while I'm not a Foxx fan I will admit that he fit nicly here.  The real star though was newcomer Jennifer Hudson who can not only sing circles around the rest of the cast but is such a talented actress, and for her first role, I mean come on.  If you can't se the talent then you're utterly blind.</p></body></html>

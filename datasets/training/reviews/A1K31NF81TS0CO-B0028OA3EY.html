<meta name="summary" content="Superman Returns"></head><body><p>Very nice movie.  Very impressive graphics and story-line.  I enjoyed the fact that they did not scrimp on the plotline and story-line.  I love movies not afraid to be over two hours.<br /><br />Can't say I love this genre of films.  I'm actually very bored by them. I have not seen every Superman movie.  My best memory of seeing the original Superman, back in the 80's was when I accidentally went in the wrong theater, showing the film, 1 1/2 hours already into the movie, and not realizing it.  My date and I sat there, very confused.  As a kid, I didn't realize that when you show up on time, usually the movie hasn't started yet.  Maybe we were 5 or ten minutes late, and thought it had started already.  Perhaps that when I first started avoiding these types of movies.<br /><br />My buddy Bobby Asslong recommended this movie.  He stood in line for a midnight showing when it launched at the bigscreen.  I would never do this, let alone, for a regular screening.  But to each his own.<br /><br />I give this 4 starts for excellent quality and story-line.<br /><br />MC White said:  Super!!!</p></body></html>

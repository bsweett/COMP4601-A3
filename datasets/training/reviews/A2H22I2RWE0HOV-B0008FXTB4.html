<meta name="summary" content="WTF Was Travolta Thinking?  This Sequel Tarnishes The Brilliance Of Get Shorty!"></head><body><p>When you have a movie like Get Shorty, base on the book by Elmore Leonard, and it is good, the first thing you want to do is capture the success of that and run with it.  Well...first off all, they took too long, and the zest that was the buzz for Get Shorty had already started to wan.  So they say . . . Hey, let's throw John Travolta & Uma Thurman together and they'll dance and it will be like a f*cking Pulp Fiction reunion and people will dig that.  No.  The problem inherent in Be Cool is that it tries way too hard to be funny.  Where Travolta's original Chilli Palmer was cool and smooth and likable...it's now just really f*cking annoying.  You wanna smash his skull in with Steven Tyler's old shriveled lips!  Could this movie have succeeded five years ago.  Maybe, but the writing is strained and some of the nostalgia has worn off and even Danny DeVito isn't his usual creep-charming self.  Altogether a colossal waste of PG-13 time.  Sequels rarely transcend the brilliance of the original and this one couldn't aspire to lick the its boots.<br /><br />Deal with it!</p></body></html>

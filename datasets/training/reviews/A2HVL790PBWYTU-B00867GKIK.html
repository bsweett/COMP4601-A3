UP is Pixar's tenth animated feature film and I would say that it's among the studio's best, except that each of its pictures tends to rank pretty much right up there. And it's looking more and more like there's no end in sight concerning Pixar's run of awesome. (Rumor has it that John Lasseter, Pixar's head honcho, once broke wind and it smelled like dandelions on a gorgeous summer day.)<br /><br />While on the surface still very much geared towards kids' sensibilities, UP trots out some fairly mature adult themes. If the first twelve minutes of UP don't at least choke you up, then you are a soulless cyborg. The opening act is a nearly dialogue-less montage, and it encapsulates the life of a man. This segment is absolutely key to setting up the rest of the story, makes you root for the old cranky, creaky gent Carl Fredricksen. The stuff that he goes thru, the sadness that crushes him, the dreams and hopes that get dashed because life simply got in the way - you know exactly why he goes on to do what he does. Which is sail away in his house strung up on thousands of balloons.<br /><br />You'd have to be an utter grinch to bring up the slovenly physics involved, so let's not. Hundreds of feet up in the air, Mr. Fredricksen hears a knock on his door. Bemused, he opens it and sees Russell cowering on his porch. Russell is a tubby eight-year-old wilderness scout, and he's enthusiastic and, if I'm brutally honest, borderline annoying. The kid needs to earn his Assisting the Elderly badge and he's set his eyes on Mr. Fredricksen. We learn eventually that Russell's overeagerness may be his way of compensating for tough times at home. UP, at its core, is about these two characters and their emotional journeys and it's also about the process of, while not exactly putting the past to bed, at least moving on. Carl and Russell move on to South America ("It's like America - but South!").<br /><br />UP is an extremely moving, heartbreaking picture, but it's also very funny and features several things which may make you cry out "Adorable!" ad nauseam. The main villain of the piece is deranged and sinister, and his assistants consist of a pack of talking dogs. Which leads me to this: I love Dug! Dug is one of the talking dogs, a rambling, whuffy Labradorish type, and he's exactly what you'd expect a lovable dog to be like. Dug isn't as clever or focused as the other dogs. He just wants to be loved, and Bob Peterson, the co-writer & co-director of the thing, comes up with the perfect voice for him. Also a neat character is Kevin the giant bird, but Kevin doesn't have a fancy collar which allows her dialogue.<br /><br />The animation is flawless. Why even go into it? It's Pixar.<br /><br />The single DVD version also comes with two riotous bonus animated shorts. "Partly Cloudy," which preceded UP in the theaters, pokes holes in the bird and the bees theory. Babies instead come from clouds. "Partly Cloudy" tells the story of one slightly seedy-looking cloud which leans towards making the not-so-cute babies and the poor stork that has to deliver them. "Dug's Special Mission" is narrated thru Dug's perspective as we see the moments leading up to Dug's first meeting with Mr. Fredricksen and Russell.<br /><br />I like the visual twist of a house kept aloft by a gazillion balloons, and then this floating house being toted around by our characters as if it were one big balloon. Rather than chilling in the crib, Mr. Fredricksen and Russell actually spend more time outdoors tethered to the house and towing it with them. "Adventure is out there!" is an often mentioned motto in the movie, and our characters land themselves in a wild, exotic adventure. Fun for the kids, fun for the grown-ups, and bolstered by powerful dramatic undertones. UP is absolutely terrific and everyone should go check i--SQUIRREL!"</p></body></html>

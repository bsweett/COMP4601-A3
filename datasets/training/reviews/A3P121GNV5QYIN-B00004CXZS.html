<meta name="summary" content="It is very cold in space (Khan)"></head><body><p>I've been a Star Trek fan since I saw the movie back when it came out in 1982,I was only a year old,but I really got into it.Like father,like daughter and like how Star Wars was to him back in 1977,that's how ST2 was to me.That scene when the Enterprise left the spacedock(which was way better in this then in the first Trek movie)was like the stardestoryer comming out of the side of the screen in Star Wars.ST2 is a sequel(or kind of)of an episode of the original series called Space Seed,with the character of Khan(played wonderfully by Ricardo Montalban)stealing the USS Reliant,to find and destory Kirk for what he did 15 years earlier.The DVD was great,the new scenes were cool and I loved the trailer which was so campy.ST2 is a very beautifully made picture which outdoes the first Trek movie.One of my favourite scenes is the first battle between the Reliant and our beloved Enterprise.I believe it was the energtic and beautiful score by James Horner,brillient characters and a great story to go with it makes ST2 The Wrath Of Khan one of the best of the Star Trek movies.All the even numbered Trek flims are the best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="terrific modern film noir with lots of dvd extras"></head><body><p>I saw this film on a holiday weekend when it first came out.  We were a group of five relatives and everyone had different tastes in film.  We finally decided to try this movie without much hope of anyone being too happy, but instead every single person loved it.  It is a thriller and a romance and a tale of good versus evil.  Set in 1950s Los Angeles and based to a small degree on actual events, this tale of corruption in Hollywood and the LAPD, with 80 speaking parts and 45 locations, deservedly won many awards. The cast is fantastic -- amazing that two young Australian actors held their own against veterans James Cromwell, Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito -- but Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe made their big American splash with this film; Kim Basinger does her best work here, and the supporting cast is flawless.  Director Curtis Hanson preserves some of the elements of the traditional film noir, like voiceover, plot twists and hidden motives, while updating others, such as the use of more natural lighting and a more character-driven story.<p>DVD extras are plentiful and fun.  The soundtrack is in English or French, the subtitles in English, French or Spanish; there is also a music only soundtrack.  Extra features include: cast and crew credits; text and pictures covering the characters of Dragnet and Bloody Christmas, 1951 -- an event similar to that in the film; prices for various items in 1953; awards the film won; three television ads and a film trailer; a fun interactive map of 1950s LA; the screen tests of Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe; a 19-minute featurette, "Off the Record", with cast and crew interviews; and the 18-photos used by Curtis Hanson to visualize the project and to pitch the film to the producer and actors.<p>This is a terrific film and the many DVD extras make this edition even more attractive.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

About 20 years have passed since Professor Henry "Indiana" Jones, Jr. discovered the Ark of the Covenant in "Raiders of the Lost Ark". He's still teaching, digging, and being caught up in international intrigues. A young man named Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) shows him a coded letter written by his godfather Harold Oxley (John Hurt), an old school friend of Indy's. Harold claims to have found a Crystal Skull that legend says will give its mysterious powers to whomever returns it to the mythic city of Akator. Harold and Mutt's mother have been kidnapped, so Indy and Mutt are off to Peru to find them. But a Soviet Col. Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), who has an intense interest in objects with paranormal properties, seeks the Skull as well.<br /><br />While previous Indiana Jones films were inspired by the adventure serials of the 1930s, George Lucas conceived this one as a take on the sci-fi exploitation films of the 1950s, the decade in which it takes place. Spending a fortune to cross one low-budget genre with another is probably not the cleverest idea. But low-budget genre films succeed because they take themselves seriously. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a> (1981) did that and improved upon the films it emulated, as did Lucas' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQJAIW">Star Wars</a> (1977). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a> (1984) was entertaining. The series went off the rails with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a> (1989). Almost a parody of the genre, it was dull as dishwater. "Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" continues the descent into self-conscious silliness. There is no suspense, no real emotion of any kind, action scenes aren't remotely credible, Indy survives a nuclear blast in a refrigerator...I could go on. And there is so much conspicuous CGI that I felt like I was watching a cartoon.<br /><br />It's obvious that the filmmakers had a lot of fun making "Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull". It shouldn't be so obvious that the folks on screen are having fun -even when their lives and limbs are supposedly imperiled -while the audience sits bored out of its gourd. The level of self-indulgence from Spielberg & Co. rivals that of Soderbergh & Co. in the last two installments of the "Ocean's" series. There seems to be a conceit that if they're having fun, the audience will have fun watching them have fun. And, in this case, watching them play around with CGI. No writing or credibility necessary. How obnoxious. And Shia LaBeouf is dreadfully miscast.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2008 single disc): There are 2 featurettes on the single disc edition. "The Return of a Legend" (18 min) interviews director Stephen Spielberg, co-writer George Lucas, producer Frank Marshall, writer David Koepp, and the cast about how they came to make another Indiana Jones movie and how the film was conceived. "Pre-Production" (11 min) interviews Pre-Visualization Supervisor Daniel D. Gregoire about the computerized form of storyboarding they used, DP Janusz Kaminski talks about the lighting, Bernie Pollack about costumes, and Shia LeBoeuf about preparing for his role. Subtitles are available in English, French, Spanish. Dubbing available in French, Spanish.</p></body></html>

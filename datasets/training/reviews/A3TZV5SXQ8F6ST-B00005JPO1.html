<meta name="summary" content="Jones of the Jungle"></head><body><p>The fourth film in this legendary franchise is old-school fun, with great action scenes that oftentimes go over-the-top and almost out of this world.<br /><br />In a nod to the late-1950s era science fiction thrillers, Dr. Henry Jones, Jr., is in a desperate race with evil agents from the Soviet Union for a psychic alien crystal skull. Though the search ultimately ends in a temple in Peru, it all starts on a military base in the Nevada desert, with "Hangar 51" home to the remains of an alien that crash landed in Roswell, New Mexico.<br /><br />Harrison Ford does an excellent job in reprising Indiana Jones for what is a return to reigning supreme in the kingdom of action adventure.</p></body></html>

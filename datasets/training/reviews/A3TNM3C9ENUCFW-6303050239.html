<meta name="summary" content="Lots of Extra's add to value of classic Epic Western"></head><body><p>If you haven't seen this movie, it represents one (if not THE) best of Sergio Leones &quot;Spaghetti&quot; westerns. At a hair under 3 hours, this is also up there with the likes of Once Upon a Time in the West (also by Leone) but moves with considerably more flow, and I think is a better script, story and movie overall. Clint plays the &quot;Man with no name&quot; a drifting, quick drawing hombre with a mean streak a mile wide, and tenacity to match and is the &quot;Good&quot; as referred to in the title. The story centers around gold buried in a cemetary, and is something of a multi subplotted journey to find it. Supported ably by Lee Van Cleef, and excellently by Eli Wallach as the unkempt and greedy &quot;Ugly&quot; part of the trio, this is a classic western in all senses. Sweeping vista's, bar room brawls, gunfights, hangings, and even a brief stop off in a War on the way. But the movie never plods, and any stale moments are usually livened up with some of Eli Wallachs comic relief (albeit playing straight). With a host of goodies on this collectable release including 4 documentaries, trailers, music and the newly renovated extended version in anamorphic widescreen, this is certainly worth owning. The transfer isn't bad, but please remember these movies were made nearly 30 years ago, and then on something of a budget. Often filmed in Europe, and South America, and sometimes dubbed over with local foreign extra's they have stood the test of time well, and look pretty fine on DVD - but there not perfect by a long way, Most will probably be forgiving however on content alone. 4 stars, but not quite 5 - Enjoy</p></body></html>

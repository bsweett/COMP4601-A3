The first movie was so funny, so cutting edge, so wonderful, and even the sequel was pretty good, though I imagine Mini-Me was the saving grace there. But this movie was horrible. It's like Mike Myers was trying to mine all the money he could, but without taking the time to create a decent script. Austin is as irritating as always, and his new (ex-singer) sidekick is just a waste. Better to have brought back Heather Graham. The evil was sucked out of Dr. Evil, and not even Mini-Me was as funny as he had been before. Even Fat Bastard (though he got very little screen time) wasn't funny. The new villain, Goldmember, was poorly done, and it just seemed Myers wanted to play another role in the movie. Dr. Evil's henchmen got little screen time, which is a shame because Number 2 and Frau are quite funny. Seth Green reprised his role as Scott Evil, but not nearly as well done in either of the prequels, though his end scene wasn't bad. We got to meet Austin Powers' father (and see clips of Austin and Evil in 'prep' school), who is played by the not so fabulous Micheal Cain. And he was a total bore. Half the trouble with this film is that it was way too crowded. The same mistake the Batman franchise made. And the ending was wrapped up all very nicely, neatly, and way too cheesey. Not spoofing itself, just a poor attempt at scriptwriting. I was really dissapointed in this film. It had so much potential, but just like Myers' Wayne's World, he has tried to milk the cash cow for too much, too fast, and without a decent script. I will admit that it did have a few funny moments, but the last 20 minutes or so aren't worth sitting in your seat.</p></body></html>

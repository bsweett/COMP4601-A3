<meta name="summary" content="Tarantino Offer a Violently Alluring Cinematic Experience!!!"></head><body><p>The continuation of Kill Bill: Vol. 1 begins with a quick recap that clarifies the Bride's (Uma Thurman) vengeful journey.  The Bride was mercilessly executed by her former boss Bill (David Carradine) and his associates at her wedding rehearsal as she tried to escape her violent past as a hired killer.  However, she survived and is now seeking those who drew the first blood.  This leads the story into several flashbacks where the Bride recollects her past which explains all parties reasons for violence.  These flashbacks fragments the storyline, yet each memory fills a void in the story as the characters are illustriously described on the silver screen.<br /><br />Tarantino maintains the visually brilliant experience that he initiated in Kill Bill: Vol. 1 where he uses cinematic nostalgia from different film genres.  The camerawork is flawless as it enhances the moment of each scene in an artistic as well as suitable manner.  In addition, Tarantino digs deeper into human values and morals as they conflict with character's backgrounds and traditions as the Bride seeks her vengeance.  The only thing that Tarantino does not improve is his score selection as it was superior in Kill Bill: Vol. 1.  Nonetheless, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 offers a violently alluring cinematic experience that has deep intrigues and much to ponder for a wide range of viewers.</p></body></html>

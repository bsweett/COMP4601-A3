<meta name="summary" content="Can't live up to the hype"></head><body><p>The Hangover is funny but predictable and therefore is not a comedy classic (as so many fawningly throw out in their snippet reviews) unless your parameters are very narrow. The Hangover would easily offend a large majority of people (which I'm totally fine with, since the easily offended are often the biggest hypocrites) and it is as age intended as the Twilight series. Just as there are forty-something moms swooning over the teen romance in that mawkish series, there will be older guys guffawing and high-fiving their fave moments from this innocuous flick. But the target audiences for both are teens and twenty-somethings whose average cinematic experiences compel them to coin the utterly useless word "classic" and apply it to this movie. Compounding the problem is the excess hype that started nearly at the premiere. It just goes to show you how powerful media saturation can be.<br />In short, if you can imagine the highlights of the last five to ten years of movies from Will Ferrell, Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow, Ben Stiller, et al, you can pretty much predict where the laughs will come from.<br />Endorsing the Vegas theme to the extreme, The Hangover is all about a wild weekend with no consequences. Take from that what you wish.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jack Nicholson is at the top of his game in this likeable romantic comedy"></head><body><p>Jack Nicholson is at the top of his game as Melvin Udall, a successful romance novelist.  Melvin lives in an exclusive apartment in New York's Manhattan and is the scourge of the neighborhood.  He is afflicted with obsessive compulsive disorder but unlike many with the malady he acts out his self-centered narcissism with mean and cruel verbiage.  His across-the-hall neighbor is a gay contemporary artist named Simon (Greg Kinnear) who is a primary receiver of Melvin's hurtful jabs.  The only other person Melvin can relate to is a single mother of an asthmatic boy who is also the only waitress at a nearby diner that will wait on him.<br /><br />This unlikely trio come together thanks for a cute and well trained little dog named Verdell.  Melvin reluctantly cares for the pooch after his owner Simon is severely beaten by burglars.  He falls for the dog which gives him the opportunity to become friendly with his neighbor.  Melvin agrees to drive Simon to Baltimore to see his parents for money, as his art work isn't selling.  Melvin asks waitress Carol (nice work from Helen Hunt) to go along.  She feels obligated since Melvin had given her access to a top doctor who is now treating her son.  The trip doesn't go all that well for Melvin and Carol.  Both need companionship and more but Melvin's dickish personality continually gets in the way.  One of the great lines in the movie is when Carol fishes for a complement from Melvin at dinner.  She had gotten dressed up and was expecting something along the lines of how nice she looked.  Instead after minutes of deflection, Melvin says to her "You make me want to be a better man."  He then crushes the moment with something about her wearing a housedress after he bought a new suit.  Carol does strike up a nice relationship with Simon back at the hotel, even agreeing to pose nude for him.  Simon's energy and creativity returns.  But...well, he's still gay.<br /><br />This film won a Golden Globe for Best Picture in 1997 in addition to awards for Nicholson and Hunt.  The acting is complemented by Shirley Knight as Carol's mom, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Simon's agent and Skeet Ulrich as a model for Simon who eventually turns on him.  It is well written and directed by James L. Brooks with writing help from Mark Andrus.  The movie could have easily turned sappy as Melvin becomes nicer.  He never quite makes it but the ending gives us hope.  Well done.</p></body></html>

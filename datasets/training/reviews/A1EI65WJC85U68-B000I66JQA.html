<meta name="summary" content="Slightly melodramatic, but an interesting movie overall."></head><body><p>Directed by Stephen Daldry (whose previous film was the excellent BILLY ELLIOT) &amp; Scripted by David Hare &amp; based on the book by Michael Cunningham, THE HOURS is split into three different time frames.<br />The first is in London in the 1920s with Nicole Kidman in her Oscar winning role as writer Virginia Woolf where she is writing her first novel MRS DALLOWAY, and fighting an oncoming breakdown during the process.(The film opens with her suicide by drowning).<br />The second segment is set in the 1950s where suburban housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore)is herself battling depression and reading Woolf's novel, and finding it inspirational in this difficult period of her life.<br />The final segment is set in 2001 where Clarrisa Vaughan (Meryl Streep), a lesbian, is dealing with the plight of her ex-husband (Ed Harris, in an excellent performance) who's dying of AIDS.<br />These three different time zones are brilliantly woven to make a seamless whole, with the film giving vivid recreations of the different eras resulting in a slightly melodramatic but overall interesting movie. THE HOURS is a film which probably holds more appeal for female viewers, but guys won't find it totally insufferable either though it does seem a bit overlong. THE HOURS is the only Nicole Kidman movie to date where male viewers won't be drooling over her, but they won't suffer a coronary if their girlfriends insist they watch it. Interestingly, the movie was disqualified for the makeup Oscar because Nicole's schnozz was digitally enhanced to make it appear seamless onscreen. So basically how much you enjoy this movie depends on whether you are a fan of Woolf (I'll admit I've never read her stuff) &amp; your gender. In my opinion the movie is good, but seriously overhyped. Typical Oscar material in other words, though Kidman gives her best performance to date &amp; deserved her Oscar.</p></body></html>

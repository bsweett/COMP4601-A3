<meta name="summary" content="Young Frankenstein (1974)-This was a classic about a classic!"></head><body><p>Young Frankenstein (1974) was a five star movie experience for me when I saw it open in a Manhattan theater in New York in 1974.  I saw this opening with a friend who was a Universal horror movie buff and an NBC film editor.  He indicated while we waited anxiously for the film to start that Mel Brooks was currently very hot and the expectations of all the young people in the audience appeared to reflect that fact.  Although the plot was conceived by Gene Wilder it was modified and directed by Mel Brooks and may have been his best movie.<br /><br />It almost made me wet my pants several times and was hilariously funny from start to finish. Some of the props were from the original Frankenstein by Universal. It drew on and satirized: Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein and The Son of Frankenstein. It also went to Broadway in the form of a musical comedy, which I never saw.</p></body></html>

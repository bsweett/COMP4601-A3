<meta name="summary" content="Why should I lie? I was quite scared"></head><body><p>In 1408, we have with us an author of cheap scare books. Even though he thinks his profession is rather respectable, one always feels John Cusack is being bit of weasel towards the beginning. His overconfidence soon turns into resentment. There were maybe three scenes in the film that I found quite scary. I loved the helplessness his character is made to feel but I also hated it because it was a bit too much like a bad dream and after a while if you're watching this on DVD, you will feel like looking at your watch. I'd say it's a 6.5/10. Mr. Jackson has no role in the film, he's just on the cover.<br /><br />The film's weakness lies in the fact that it had no answers to the problem it creates in itself. There was no moral conclusion it seemed to draw. It was meant to scare and bruise one's conscience but you definitely wouldn't think of this film unless asked to name one of the scariest films of the year, 2007. (Vacancy, you're next)<br /><br />PS - *gasp*</p></body></html>

The kids don't even act amazed when they enter Narnia.  They act like they see fauns and talking beavers every day.  The beavers look like giant rats.  You can easily tell what was CG and what was not.  I have no idea why they got Andrew Adamson to make this movie.  He made Shrek and Shrek 2.  Why not get a qualified director.  Narnia also seems to be an island where you can get everywhere in a day or two.  The kids go all over Narnia in a day or two.  And why does the professor look like the KFC guy?<br /><br />  There are some good things in this movie though.  Aslan looks great and Liam Neeson was the right voice.  Parts of the battle also looked good but, this was a failure.  This could have been great but it isn't.  What were they thinking?</p></body></html>

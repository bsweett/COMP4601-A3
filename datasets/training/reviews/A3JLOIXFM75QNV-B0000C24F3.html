Best sequel to a film, ever. As for the other 2...well, Alien 3 was OK I guess. It had it's moments. Resurrection, I'm just gonna pretend it doesn't exist. Though I admit, I have seen it more than once. Its just too poorly written. However, I love the character of Ripley, she is one of my fave characters in film anywhere. For die-hard fans, this set is for you.</p></body></html>

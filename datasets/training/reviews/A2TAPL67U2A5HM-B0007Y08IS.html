It attacks the smug attitude of Hollywood, Broadway, and with songs like "I am so ronery" and the pearl harbor song which totally slammed the movied and the acting ability of Ben Affleck. The movie pulls no punshes and offends both democrats and republicans equally and is quite explicit both in terms of crude language and sexually with the sex scene with the puppets. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are brilliant and this piece of work is right up their with Swift when it comes to biting satire and is one of the best movies in the last decade. I loved it and I will see it again.</p></body></html>

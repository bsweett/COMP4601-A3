The hidden implication of these criticisms is that "it's not okay to make a movie showing a horrific act of terrorism, and these acts being avenged, because the current war on terror is so wrong."  Oh, REEEAAAALLLLLYYYYY???<br /><br />If I remember correctly, over the past few decades, there have been groups of Muslim terrorists who kill and maim innocent Americans and other "foreigners" with great glee.  Yet Hollywood has relished depicting our efforts to root out such criminals/terrorists/mass-murderers with disdain.  Now I'm the first to admit that war is an ugly thing, that many mistakes have been made in the latest war and that the goal of "eliminating" terrorism may be a stretch, to say the least.  But I also remember the huge truck bomb in Beirut, the USS Cole, and some attacks on the World Trade Center.  I think it's okay to show that a part of the American experience might include investigating acts of terrorism and then hunting down and destroying the perpetrators.<br /><br />Films like JARHEAD, IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH, etc. tell us that we'd all be better off if we just brought the troops home.  Movies like UNITED 93 remind us that we were acted in our own land.  A movie like THE KINGDOM reminds us that terror against Americans can strike anywhere, and it dares to suggest that we can actually fight back.  I had no real problem with its "politics"...aside from a tacked-on and silly ending that implied some moral equivalency between the terrorists and the FBI's efforts to hunt them down.<br /><br />Okay, politics aside now.  How was the movie?  It was pretty darn good.  The acts of terror that start the film are credible and terrifying.  The FBI team that is more or less snuck into Saudi Arabia to investigate are a bit unlikely (of all the people they could have brought, was bring a woman the best choice?)  But our stars (Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) do intense work and take it all very seriously.  They spend a lot of time being frustrated at the red-tape that is constantly in their way.  But what I liked is that the movie showed them gradually winning the trust of a couple of Arab police men...men who are equally outraged at the destruction the terrorists have wrought.  There is nice interplay between the Americans and Saudis...occasionally it is a bit cliched and predictable...but it never teeters into the maudlin or God-forbid "buddy comedy" mode.  Because the action of the movie moves along briskly, there isn't really time for subtle characterization.  Foxx is the tough-talking leader (and the least convincing character, actually), Garner is the woman that all the Arabs are outraged at, Bateman is Jewish and a smart-mouth, so naturally he has some problems fitting in and Chris Cooper is Chris Cooper...which is a good thing...that guy is just so darn interesting to watch all the time.<br /><br />Most of the movie is really just leading us to the final 30 minutes or so, when the little group of investigators falls under attack.  And holy smokes, is that stuff exciting.  It is super tense and hurtles along at breakneck speed.  With the jumpy hand-held camera work, fast editing, terrific sound editing and lots of bullets flying and bodies dropping...it gets your adreneline going.  Everything leading up to this has been entertaining and interesting, but it's the end of the movie where you get a great payoff.<br /><br />Since this is a Hollywood production, the script does occasionally get predictable, and Jamie Farr has some scenes in which he relates with little kids that are really pretty silly.  Not because Farr can't talk to kids, but he just says stuff to them that no one in real life would.  So yes, like almost every movie ever made, we are being manipulated somewhat.  But for the most part, the movie does it successfully.  Does it exploit the war on terror simply to entertain?  There's nothing simple about that question...I WAS entertained...but I was also reminded of the grim fact that we need people fighting the war on terror.</p></body></html>

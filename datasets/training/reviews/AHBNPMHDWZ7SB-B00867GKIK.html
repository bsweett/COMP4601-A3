<meta name="summary" content="Another Beautiful Entry in Pixar's Filmography"></head><body><p>To be honest, the first time I saw Up in theatres, I liked it, but I just did not see what everyone was so excited about. I kept thinking to myself, "What's the big deal?" I am very happy to say that I finally see what the big deal is. Up is a beautiful, heartfelt story. It captures the life of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Edward Asner) perfectly from his youth, to his golden years. The montage near the beginning was one of the most wonderful things that I have ever seen, and probably the most wonderful thing that I have seen in a Pixar film to date. The scene itself set a variety of moods, from sad to joyous, but the music really brought it to life. It was perfectly set to another great score by Michael Giacchino, who also blew me away with his Star Trek score. In my opinion, Up has to be the best Pixar film yet. They have done nothing but good things for the last couple of decades. It seems like everything they make becomes a classic. Until I saw Up for the second time, I would never have imagined myself ever saying that it was the best they have done so far. But it is the truth. The imagination is a beautiful thing, and those guys over at the Disney Pixar studios have plenty of it. I loved the maturity in the tone of the story, even though it remained a children's' movie all the way through. I'm sure not too many kids would have picked up on the little hints like, *Possible Spoiler* why they were sad in the pregnancy doctor's office, or why Ellie couldn't make it up that hill, etc. But those are the kinds of things that make both children and adults love these movies so much. There is something in it for every single person in the crowd. Everything in the film is well done, but this story is undoubtedly character driven.<br /><br />The characters were all delightful. Carl reminded me so much of my own grandpa. So sad deep inside from the lost of his wife, and so grumpy because of his sadness, but also so caring for others and eager for adventure. Russell, I'll admit he annoyed me at first, but I soon realized that's what he was supposed to do. We were supposed to feel what Carl felt. Then over time, as we heard Russell's story and saw how nice of a person he was, we grew to care about him like we did for Carl. Doug and Kevin were great from the start. Even though Doug started off trying to capture Kevin for his master, he was always so sweet and funny that we never disliked him for it. Kevin made me laugh out loud a couple of times, especially when he mimicked Carl. Charles Muntz was an unlikely, yet great villain. He was the sole motivation for Ellie and Carl's fixation on South America, but his dedication to his quest drove him crazy. This was just an all around fantastic movie. The only reason I cannot give it a full score is the little things that I didn't like, like the dogs flew the airplanes and tied Russell up. The explanation for them being able to speak was acceptable, and the fact that they could speak added dimension to them as characters, and ultimately the story itself. But then they did those things that pulled me out of the story. Yeah, I do understand that the whole premise of a floating house, and everything is not really based on anything practical, and nor does it try to pretend that it is possible. Of course it's a children's movie, and they are expected to be like that. I just didn't like those aspects of it, but they didn't take anything away from how brilliant the overall film was. It was a masterpiece. I cannot wait for Toy Story 3, and whatever Pixar has slated after that.</p></body></html>

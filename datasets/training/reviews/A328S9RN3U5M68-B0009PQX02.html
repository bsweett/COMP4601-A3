<meta name="summary" content="Negotiations and their Consequences"></head><body><p>HOSTAGE, based on the best-selling novel by Robert Crais and adapted for the screen by Doug Richardson, has all the right ingredients for an action thriller: good plot, good character motivation, the requisite battle between good and evil, the transformation of a past bad deed into a current good turn, pyrotechniques, good sets, good actors.  What more could you ask for a movie in this genre? Editing!<br /><br />Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis looking far better sans hair than in the overly hirsute opening scenes) is a hostage negotiator in Los Angeles and after a traumatic event, transfers his family to a little Ventura County town.  The job as Chief of Police of the quiet burg seems boring until the day of the movie when three punk teenagers (Ben Foster, Jonathan Tucker, Marshall Allman) respond to their testosterone and antisocial tendencies and decide to steal an Escalade SUV from rich man  Walter Smith (Kevin Pollak) and his children Jennifer (Michelle Horn) and Tommy (Jimmy Bennett) who live in a superstructure, highly guarded mansion that serves as a headquarters for criminal money manipulation (unbeknownst to the perpetrators).  What begins as a 'simple robbery' escalates into a heinous situation that even Talley feels he cannot handle.  The teen trio holds the family hostage, requesting a helicopter to aid their escape.  Memories and flashbacks to Talley's Los Angeles fiasco drive him to superhero deeds in the messy situation and through a series of truly interesting twists this cat and mouse game of death comes to an interesting end.<br /><br />Yes, there are subplots galore, deaths, fire, explosions, death-defying actions, and unexpected turns of events - all of which propel the breakneck speed of this film under the direction of Florent Emilio Siri.  But clocking in at 113 minutes feels like 90 minutes could have accomplished the same results with more intensity.  Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis and few can carry off these flicks as well.  The supporting cast is fine with a special nod to Ben Foster who seems made to play the creepy teenaged protocriminal.  One wonders why the producers elected to select brilliant composer Alexandre Desplat ('Birth', 'Girl with the Pearl Earring', 'The Upside of Anger', etc) to create a score that is 1) buried by all of the onscreen noise and 2) gratefully so!  In all the film, with a lot of editing, could rank up there with the best of them in this genre.  As it is, it is pretty solid 'entertainment.'  Grady Harp, July 05</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Relax, It's Just a Comedy -- Gross, Loud, and  Funny One"></head><body><p>You may disagree with me, but 'Team America -- World Police' is NOT the best thing Trey Parker/Matt Stone have ever created.  It is still Eric Cartman, or any characters in 'South Park' which should be called their best, but, well, like most reviewers before, I find 'Team America - World Police' mostly funny.<br /><br />I said, 'mostly,' for some parts are definitely unfunny, but I'll talk about it later.  Inspired by a UK cult TV show 'Thunderbird' made in the 60s, the self-appointed marionett rescue team save the world from the terroists.  Of course, that's a satire, and the target is the current US policy, but Trey Parker doesn't stop there.<br /><br />[MAKING FOOL OF ... EVERYTHING]  Yes, don't think about the politics.  Michael Moore (I mean his lookalike puppet) appears, but the purpose of his inclusion here is, it seems, not political but very personal, as if Trey Parker (who was briefly in 'Bowling for Columbine') has some grudges against him.<br /><br />Anyway, 'Team America' makes fool of the right, the left, or everything it thinks deserves bashing.  The film's story itself is mocking Jerry Bruckheimer films, in which an all-American boy is made an all-American hero after many struggles (read actions) and some pains (read booze) before he gains the big prize (read love, or a chick).  Which means the film includes a 'love scene' of the marionetts, of which reality would be embarrassing to some.  And you can hear a song stating the quality of one Micheal Bay film and the acting abilities of Ben and Cuba.<br /><br />[HOLLYWOOD STARS] And what is most daring (and outrageous) is the special appearances of the Hollywood celebrities, who are, according to the film, too politically aggressive.  It's easy to imagine that Trey Parker doesn't like those actors who express their views on politics in the programs like 'Crossfire' or the magazines like 'Rollingstone.'  Unfortunately, however, this is the least satisfying part for me, because, quite frankly, these marionetts just don't look like the real counterparts.  Alec Baldwin looks more like his brother Daniel, and other lookalike puppets are no better.  (Interestingly, George Clooney's puppet appears, but he receives comparatively better treatment among the final action scene, in which those "celebrities" turn baddies and meet nasty fate.  And Clooney is a known 'South Park' fan, and appeared there.  Maybe Trey Parker didn't bring himself to treat him bad, even a puppet.)<br /><br />Technically, however, the marionettes of the main characters  are fantastic (especially those of 'Lisa' and 'Gary'), with their subtle facial expressions which look often so uncannily real.  And also very impressive is the national leader of North Korea, where this film would be banned forever with good reasons.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching 'Team America' though it often goes too far, and still I like 'South Park' better, both TV series or the filmed version.  And surely 'Team America' has political aspects, but you don't have to offended with them.  It's just a comedy -- a comedy to which nothing is sacred.  Enjoy it as such if you can.</p></body></html>

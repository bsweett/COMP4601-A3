SALVATION has got the action, the chases and the explosions but one really couldn't care less about the characters, with the women being the very worst (what was the point of bringing Jane Alexander out of retirement for a bland two minute role?). It's good to know though that in the near apocalyptic future the women are still hot and shampoo is available in abundance (Bloodgood) as is makeup (Howard). And for me, the most annoying & recent trend from these movies: in I and II you just knew that if the Terminators got within a hair of their targets they were most likely toast, now in III and specially in IV they get to John Connor often, grab his shirt and throw him into the air while he miraculously lands on a soft surface, unfortunately for Skynet these more recent Terminators seem to be too dumb to figure out this isn't going to get the job done anytime soon. No wonder the sense of excitement has pretty much gone from this series.</p></body></html>

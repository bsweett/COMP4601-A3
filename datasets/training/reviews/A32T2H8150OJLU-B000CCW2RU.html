<meta name="summary" content="Better than I thought it would be!"></head><body><p>I remember when this film came out back in 2005, but was sufficiently unimpressed that I never bothered to watch it.  I think this was a remake of a movie that I saw back in the 1970s or so, maybe early 1980s, but I can't remember the title.  I finally tracked it down, that movie was 1978's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790743671">Coma</a>,starring Geniveve Bujold and Michael Douglas.  If it wasn't a remake, it at least has some strong similarities.  Now that I think of it, I see that there are significant differences, but if you've seen COMA and THE ISLAND you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Well, I finally had a chance to take a look at this film, and I was, frankly, quite impressed.  Scarlett Johansson, Ewan MacGregor, and Sean Bean headline the cast.  Let's see...who will we make the protagonist and who will we make the antagonist in the main plot?  I wonder, I wonder...<br /><br />Anyway, McGregor and Johansson live in a highly controlled, closed environment habitat to protect them and many others from a dreadful plague that has affected the world sometime in the future.  Yep, this is a futuristic Sci-Fi flick...and I tend to like these.  So, their lives are safe, but bland, and there is a strong component of "Big Brother is watching" to their existence.  People wait, work, and watch to see who will win the ocassional lottery to go to "The Island", a paradisiacal place where people live in complete luxury.<br /><br />MacGregor starts to wonder about their existence and starts asking questions.  Then, one day he finds a large moth that somehow made its way in from the outside, and this starts him wondering whether there really is a plague out there.<br /><br />If you like unexpected plot twists, plenty of action, a sci-fi slant, and. you know, car chase scenes, gunfire, and guys dressed in black chasing the heroes, you'll like this film.<br /><br />It's good, but probably won't be a classic, though I'd be happy to watch it again sometime.<br /><br />4 solid stars.</p></body></html>

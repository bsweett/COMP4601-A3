<meta name="summary" content="THE WORST OF PIXAR, BEST OF ANYTHING ELSE"></head><body><p>As much as I try to like this movie, I find very hard making any kind of connection with the car characters. I doubt too many people have ever looked at their vehicle as something with a life of its own, unlike with their toys (or even bugs for that matter). I also can't avoid noticing the similarity to another movie, Doc Hollywood, which by the way, was truly mediocre.<br />That said, the Pixar excelence is present here and there's is no denying they got the most out of this story. I just don't think it was that good a premise to begin with.</p></body></html>

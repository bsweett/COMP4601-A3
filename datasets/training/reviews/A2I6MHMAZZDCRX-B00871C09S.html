"Jeff" Jefferies (James Stewart) is trapped in his apartment with a severely broken leg.  Aside from the daily visits from his nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) and girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), his only diversion is watching the people in the apartment complex out his back window.  And since it is the middle of a horrid heat wave, everyone has their window open at all times.<br /><br />Late one night, Jeff witness something funny going on across the way.  The invalid wife in one of the apartments has vanished and the husband (Raymond Burr) is taking many trips out of the apartment carrying something in his suitcase.  Jeff quickly assumes the wife was murdered.  Enlisting Lisa and Stella's help, he tries to prove it.  But is he right?  And can he prove it without leaving his own apartment?<br /><br />I seem to have a weird relationship with Hitchcock.  I don't enjoy the movies everyone considers his masterpieces, but I do enjoy his lesser known films.  In keeping with this tradition, I didn't enjoy this one as much as I thought I would.  The beginning of the film was very slow as the many side stories were set up.  Even once the main story got going, I still found it rather slow for my tastes.  The ending, however, was exciting if a bit predictable.  And the acting was great, bringing the characters to life.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to keep watching Hitchcock's films.  But I'm going to explore all his films to see which ones I think are his best.  I doubt that this one, while not his worst, will make the list of his best either.</p></body></html>

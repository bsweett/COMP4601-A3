<meta name="summary" content="Could have been better!"></head><body><p>Being in the broadcasting business, I can identify with most of the routines that goes on in the newsroom from this movie.  On an entertainment level, this film had the potential of being very funny.  It was very spotty as far as laughs.  However, the script comes off prety lame.  The acting was pretty obnixious and made it seem like I was going through a root canal at the dentist office.  Unfortunately, you'll be disappointed if you're expecting lots of laughs.  It could have been a much better film!</p></body></html>

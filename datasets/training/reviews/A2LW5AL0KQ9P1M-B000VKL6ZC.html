<meta name="summary" content="My Sincerest Condolences to Carpenter ..."></head><body><p>... it has to sting when another director "kills" your crowning achievement.<br /><br />Here's the thing: I had actually read the horrendous critical reviews of Zombie's film and thought, "When have critics ever understood horror?" So, in a weird way, I guess I have only myself to blame ...<br /><br />As someone who teaches horror-film theory and horror-film studies, I know what will endure the ages and what will not. Still, I'm not some jaded academic. I love horror ... the more (figuratively) visceral, the better. Carpenter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009UW0N">Halloween</a> (1978) is well-respected by film scholars (even the snobbiest!) for a reason: it manages to inspire terror with little on-screen bloodshed ... much like Hooper's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FS9FE4">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a> (1974).  Neither of these works necessitate a remake. And, while Nispel's 2003 revisit of "TCM" elicited tension and revulsion (both good), Zombie's "Halloween" only elicited anger.<br /><br />Foremost, the film is technically unpolished. At one point, the viewer becomes convinced that Loomis (McDowell) is responsible for Myers's adult outbursts. In early therapy sessions, Loomis and Myers both wear black ... it becomes the topic of their conversation. It draws a parallel between the two. Then, Loomis pens an account of his experience with Myers and begins a book-tour. The scene opens with a projection of Myers' face ... and as Loomis utters "Behind these eyes one finds only blackness, they absence of light, these are of a psychopath" the camera moves to an extreme close-up of Loomis' eyes. So for the entire film, the viewer waits for the "other shoe to drop" ... for Loomis to confess some (perhaps "unconscious") involvement in Myers' now silent rage. But this never happens ... so one is led to ask, why create these parallels and then fail to complete the message? At best, we may discover the connection in the director's cut ... at worst, it was a really unforgivable error in filming.<br /><br />The casting of Myers is horrendous. Why make him physically monstrous? Carpender's original casting of Nick Castle was clever (tall but muscular), Zombie's casting of WWF/WCW wrestler Tyler Mane (6'8 and grotesquely built) was all too literal. Carpender's Myers terrifies audiences without having to appear physically extraordinary ... he is "The Shape" (for those in the know) ... not "The Lumbering Blob."<br /><br />Moreover, by providing one of the most wretched back-stories I have ever witnessed, Zombie destroys Carpenter's most gruesome message ... some people are born evil. This is why Donner's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYK4KS">The Omen</a> (1976) was so gripping. Damien was born evil ... no amount of compassion (mother's love/father's love) could alter that which was encoded on the child's DNA (if you will). To make Myers' a product of his environment ... well, that's just obvious. I forgot, was this a film or an after-school special?<br /><br />These are the most unbelievably painful problems ... I'll not even launch into the needless deaths of several adults who DO NOT warrant such treatment (by logic and theory). Or Zombie's vile treatment of a "Halloween" cult-favorite like Danielle Harris (creepy, but in a pathetic way). Maybe Zombie thought he was evolving the genre ... maybe he thought was modernizing Carpenter's work ... maybe he needs to mature (but he's already forty-five) and learn from the masters (like Carpenter and Hooper): less is better.<br /><br />So, I return to my original question ... "When have critics ever understood horror?" I guess I must have forgot that the critics were blown-away by Romero's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IQNAG">Dawn of the Dead</a> (1978), raved over Kubrick's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATQJ">The Shining</a> (1980), lauded Hooper's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V4UFZK">Poltergeist</a> (1982), gushed over Shyamalan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004BZIY">The Sixth Sense</a> (1999), and loved Boyle's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMA8">28 Days Later</a> (2003). I guess they have always known what constitutes film worthy of an audience. Next time, I hope I will take my cue from these professionals ... and, I sincerely hope Zombie will do likewise.</p></body></html>

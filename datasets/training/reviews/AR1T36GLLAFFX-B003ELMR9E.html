<meta name="summary" content="An Very Good Pacino Vehicle"></head><body><p>"Insomnia" is a 2002 film that explores the inner workings of a top detective (Al Pacino as Wll Dormer) as he nears the end of a brillant career as a police investigator, who is so feed up with the obviously guilty going free that he's starting to compromise his vaulted integrity to make sure justice is done.<br /><br />The wild beauty of the Alaskian landscape should have gotten second-billing behind Pacino, as it plays an intregral in several parts of the movie.  As it is, Hilary Swank, Robin Williams and Paul Dooley are memorable in their roles as an eager police detective, a murder suspect, and the crusty local police chief, respectively.<br /><br />How does it all mesh?  Well, indeed, as an increasingly tired Dormer (played well, as usual, by Pacino) careens from mistake to coverup, until he has a change of heart, salvaging his career along the way.<br /><br />However, Amazon lists this as an 'essential video'.  It's a good movie, but it's not in the league of, say, Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz, The Seven Samuri, and so on.<br /><br />I'd rate this a four-star film.  Recommended, primarily of Pacino's usual excellent acting.  Williams is also notable for his low-keyed, everyman, but chilly, role.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Why does everyone diss this movie?"></head><body><p>I'm a special child because I like movies that others don't. Well, I watched this one at an advanced screening a while back but unfortunately missed the first 15 minutes. So, I missed the exorcism scene which is a shame. Well, you know what this means, I'm going to have to get this one once it's out on DVD. But that's not all, it's actually a good movie. It was confusing at times but I think that this movie is deeper than most say. The movie is about John Constantine, a man that can see dead people that walk on earth. He thus has to take them back to hell where they belong. The beautiful Rachel Weisz co stars also as someone who believes that the "suicide" of her sister isn't a suicide. The way that Constantine travels to Hell is really neat and original and the fight scenes are really neat, as he has some really cool weapons. The bible is also referenced in the movie but this isn't the same bible. This one has a "deleted" section where it speaks about the son of the devil. The movie is very original and neat and if you ignore some very confusing moments, you'll like it. But, no one else did, so I guess I'm a SPECIAL CHILD! I'm the same guy though that dissliked Scarface and Taxi Driver, so you kmow..<br /><br />I also found something very neat about this movie. At the death of the devil's son, I noticed that he posed no resistance and just died. So, I saw in a weird way a parallel between Jesus and him as they both went down without resistance to accomplish a mission. Anyway, if you are religious, you might notice this like I did, and there are some other religious moments. That's what I think about a movie that very few people like.</p></body></html>

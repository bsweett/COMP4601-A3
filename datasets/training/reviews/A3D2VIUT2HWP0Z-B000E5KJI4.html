<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable, and thoroughly EPIC"></head><body><p>As the credits note at the end, this film is based on the Epic Story . What is probably most noteworthy about the film is that it is retold in a "modern" way, and is done to suit the milieu of here and now. That is what this kind of story is all about; it's not the exact story that counts, it is the essence of the story that counts. It helps if you include the translations of the classic lines, but people who are pedants for the textual original have to know that the feeling and the point of this story is one from a thoroughly oral tradition, so it is quite appropos that a version of this kind should appear.<br /><br />Yes, it has lessons; yes it has points to make, but the greatness of films like this one, is that it is immensely  entertaining.<br /><br />I was especially  impressed with Eric Bana... from Stand up comic, to playing Chopper Reid on film, Bana has been surprising in his ability to play diverse  roles.<br /><br />Plus, the diverse characters who support the central leads are amazing. Peter O'toole is superb in this role.<br /><br />In addition, the loss of the gods as a story telling  device says a lot about  the current society rather than the society of the time of TROY.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Clint Eastwood NEVER Disappoints!!---This Is Another Classic!!"></head><body><p>I have been a fan of Clint Eastwood the actor and the<br />producer-director for most of my life and this man very rarely<br />leaves his audience disappointed!--He is a master storyteller<br />and embodies his characters wholly and completely!--This movie,<br />about a gruff, bigoted man who's neighborhood is changing in ways<br />that he doesn't like is classic Eastwood contridiction with<br />an undercurrent of humanity and a message about the<br />values of tolerance without being all "afterschool special" on us!<br />And of course, there's plenty of Clint Eastwood at his<br />butt-kicking best! I don't like to give scene by scene rundowns<br />in my reviews because I want you all to see and judge it<br />for yourselves. But this is a brilliantly acted and directed film<br />and a definite MUST HAVE for your DVD collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I Should Hate This Film But . . . *sigh* . . . I Can't . . ."></head><body><p>An American adaptation of Hyun-Seung Lee's film "Siworae," "The Lake House" charms its audience with a fairly innovative concept: sci-fi romance. (Yes, "Somewhere in Time," starring Christopher Reeves and Jane Seymour, also toyed with this idea in 1980 . . . but few have done so since). Now, there are some very familiar strains heard in this film (both American and Korean). NONETHELESS, the "heart" of this movie triumphs over whatever cliches you might find.<br /><br />Moreover, I have read some complaints that the film is either A.) difficult to follow OR B.) inaccurate. Neither are true. Initially, you have to puzzle through "who is where" . . . but we are SHARING the characters' own confusion (it is meant to bond us to the film). Soon, the film clarifies (as the characters situations become clear to THEM) and we can enjoy the love-story:) And, yes, the writing makes perfect sense. If you have ever unraveled the physics of Kelly's "Donnie Darko" . . . or simply delighted in a time-travel film . . . you will understand HOW this all works out:) And, even if you have not done either of these things, I'm willing to bet that you will not get lost or frustrated with this film.<br /><br />Reeves and Bullock portray their characters tenderly and convincingly. (They both just keep getting better-looking . . . which gives us thirty-somethingers hope for the future!!) Moreover, there is just enough tension in the film to keep the audience "guessing" . . . trust me. Ohhh, and did I mention the adorable canine who obviously has some pact with cupid?!!<br /><br />No, this film isn't perfect, but that hardly matters. Put your "intellect" on hold for an hour and a half, and just enjoy this film for what it is.  (Hide it from your girlfriend if you are too embarrassed to watch with her the first time through . . . and then share it with her later . . . don't forget the tissues!!)<br /><br />Frequently, I advise to see the original (especially after a cavalcade of bad Asian adaptations) but this one succeeds in its intended goal!! Kudos.<br /><br />If what you want is a genuinely romantic film (without pretense), then see this one:)</p></body></html>

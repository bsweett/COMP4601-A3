<meta name="summary" content="A cyber dream!"></head><body><p>"The holiday" is a sympathetic film that bets for your most beloved illusions and the ancestral wishes for watching how the fairy tales come true in this age of globalization. Two lonely and disappointed women will make a decisive twist of fate to their lives betting for a travel from U.K. to L.A. in order to make a sudden and decisive change of their affective lives.<br /><br />Until this point everything seems extremely predictable but the touch of originality given by her talented director, letting a secondary personage breaths and gives the story a persuasive "lesson of dignity". Arthur Abbot (Eli Wallach) is an old and "out of the game" script writer whose wise advises to our very young English girl (Kate Winslet) fits admirably. Plus, the presence of the charismatic Joe Black gives this film laughable freshness. On the other hand Cameron Diaz gives one of her prominent roles in years proving she is much more comedian instead dramatic actress, and the presence of Jude Law as a consecrated and full time devoted father, whose recent affective loss will not avoid he seduces this American girl, who really thinks she has dealt will all kind of situations.<br />At the end, a charming resolution will conclude with a soft smile in our minds and hearts.<br /><br />A summer breeze and romantic film free of violence and special effects (which by itself it sounds incredible at these times don't you?)</p></body></html>

In my first watching of this film, I detected at least one major, and I think deliberate, factual error.  One of the characters is handing a Carcano rifle as another character says words to the effect, "The three shots took 7.8 seconds to fire.  Let's time it."  He then picks up a stopwatch and clicks, "Go."  The other character, works the action [once], he works the action again [twice], he works the action a third time [three].  "9.2 seconds," the one man emotes.  "Impossible."<br /><br />Well, from reading over reports of the shooting I knew that this scenario was an untruth.  The timing was from the moment of the sound of the first shot--a couple of seconds after the first levering.<br /><br />Fascinated by such an obvious error and, considering the fact that I am a pathologist and a shooter, I decided to redo the entire shooting scenario--personally--using the same type Carcano-Mannlicher rifle and the same type ammunition that the FBI claimed Oswald used.  I performed accuracy, rate of fire, bullet penetration, bullet deformation, head deflection and other studies.  By the time I was finished, I probably did as much ballistic work with the Kennedy shooting as anyone in the world, not excluding the FBI and CIA.<br /><br />If you're interested in the results of my ballistic studies, try my website at www.mexicanconquest.com.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, MD, author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="United We Stand"></head><body><p>Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy) brings us United 93, a real-time rendering of the events that happened on one of the most fateful days of our lifetime. We first meet the four young men who hijacked the flight, then are introduced to the passengers on the plane, air traffic controllers, the FAA, and a military command center. The first portion of the film centers on the first three hijacked planes on 9/11; we watch, impossibly, as the FAA, air traffic controllers, and the military try and respond to a threat that literally appeared out of nowhere, and the difficult, time-sensitive decisions that needed to be made. It certainly gives one pause to think: what would *I* do if faced with such a catastrophe? When the focus switches to United 93, the film gathers considerable momentum. Although there is a relatively large "cast", Greengrass does an enviable job humanizing all of them. It would have been easy to sweep over each person and create a character that was close to the original but still clich&eacute;d, or worse yet caricaturized. In less skilled hands, this may have happened. But Greengrass obviously did his research, learned as much as he could about the people on that plane, and brought them to life in short time. That's not easy to do.<br /><br />Greengrass deserves further commendation for constraint. It would have been easy to turn this into a melodramatic affair, but instead he merely dramatized. He showed us the events as they took place, he showed us the passenger's emotions, and asked us to respond. And we responded! How could we not cheer as the passengers began their revolt? Rejoice at their bravery when they broke into the cockpit and wrested away control of the plane? Cry when we spied in on passenger's conversations with family and loved ones, especially knowing that Greengrass researched the passenger's lives extensively and that the conversations were more likely than not accurately depicted.<br /><br />This is a review of the DVD, and it gets extra high marks from me for the Bonus Features, particularly the interviews with family members. First, they were subtitled, which is sadly still a rarity (I'm hearing impaired, so miss out on most of the bonus/special features); most importantly, though, they reminded us that these were all real people. Next door neighbors. Friends. Co-workers. Brothers, sisters, uncles, parents.<br /><br />The passengers of United 93 deserve a standing ovation from all of us. They were part of a tragedy, indeed, but they fought to stave off an even greater tragedy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bringing Chris Van Allsburg's magical Christmas story to computer generated life"></head><body><p>I do not believe that there are any books that are so sacred that they should not be made into a movie.  But I did have some reservations about bringing Chris Van Allsburg's delightful picture book "The Polar Express" to the big screen as a computer animated film for two reasons.  The first is that half the charm of the original are Van Allsburg's exquisite pencil drawings.  I knew there would be something lost in the transformation from black & white to color.  The second is that the other half of the story's charm comes from the simple story it tells and unlike the massive amount of cuts that had to be made to bring "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" to the screen" writer-director Roger Zemeckis had to add a whole lot to the original story.  This risks losing the simple message in all the dancing waiters and train rides across the ice.  What I would have loved to have seen would be a half-hour television special, shown without commercial interruption, where CGI is used to preserve the look of the original (to wit, this generation's version of "The Snowman").<br /><br />That being said, this version of "The Polar Express" is delightful in its own way even if you do not find it to be as magical as the book.  The story is of a young boy who has reached the age of doubt, where he is about to decided that Santa Claus is not real.  That is when the Polar Express arrives at his door and he discovers he has a ticket in his pocket (not the pocket with the hole in it but the other one), a magical train that will take him to the North Pole to find out the truth for himself (when the train appears out of a cloud of steam and snow is the point in the film that best captures the spirit of the book).  The train is filled with other children and there are minor adventures to be had, both on the journey and when they arrive at their wonderful destination.  Tom Hanks lends his voice and ethos to not only the Conductor, but also the Father, the Hero Boy, the Hobo, Scrooge and Santa, which essentially makes him as much the narrator of the tale as several of the characters.  That is important because there really is a sense here of a story being told that is a key part of the dynamic.  Like most Christmas messages, this is one that has to be passed along each year so that people remember it and keep it in their hearts.<br /><br />I have no problem believing as a general rule of thumb that anybody who has not read the book would have no problems adding another star to their rating for this 2004 film.  The computer animation is pretty good and this will undoubtedly becoming a favorite for both the young and the young at heart.  Final note: I am coming to terms with the fact that you have to wait about a year for Christmas movies to come out on DVD.  Certainly this is the time of year to want to watch and buy such things, but it always seems strange to think that I was interested in seeing this movie a year ago.  Then again, "Miracle on 34th Street" was actually released on May 2, 1947, so go figure (but that is the official movie of Thanksgiving, even with Santa as a pivotal character).</p></body></html>

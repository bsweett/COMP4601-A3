<meta name="summary" content="Despite the flaws, Indy is still the best action hero of all time"></head><body><p>What can I really say?  Being that it is popular to hate on Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, giving a positive review almost sets me up for accusations of my "inferior intelligence" and that I am "easily entertained."  Well, I'll tell you this much, I am neither, and yet I found Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to be an incredibly entertaining experience and leaving the theater I had no idea people would be treating like one of THOSE movies; one of the ones people just love to rant and rave about without end.  This film is light years ahead of the first two Star Wars prequels and easily better than those dreadful Transformers movies that have been making so much money lately.<br /><br />Okay, to start off this movie is clearly the lesser of the Indy films, but I feel lots of people have been overly harsh on this movie for not living up to its older siblings.  The greatest action-adventure film trilogy of all time is one hard act to follow, and so Spielberg and Lucas clearly wanted to try something different.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what many audiences hated most about this Indy: too different from the originals.  It is flawed, but I never felt this movie came from greed.  It was the nostalgia, and recollections of two friends, who only wished to recreate the entertainment of their youth, and that fun factor was present throughout Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, in the end I do think the good aspects of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull easily outweigh the bad.<br /><br />For starters, Indiana Jones as played by Harrison Ford...do I really need to say anything else?  This is the best action hero to ever grace the silver screen and no one will ever crack a bullwhip the same.  I really don't think I should have to defend this character, or explain what makes him great.  Welcome back Mister Jones.  In an age of giant robots dominating the box office I welcome your return with open arms.<br /><br />Also back all the way from Raiders of the Lost Ark is Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, who is sorely underused in the film's plot.  I'm fine with bringing back one of Indy's previous love interests, but she really doesn't contribute much to the plot.  She drives some cars during the jungle chase scene and aside from that is nothing but an extra face in the cast.  If they were going to bring back Indy's original love interest they should have given her more to do.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett's Irina Spalko is, in my humble opinion, the best antagonist in an Indy film since Major Arnold Toht (the Nazi in the all-black get-up in Raiders, for those of you who don't know his name).  Here is a female villain whose tone is cool, precise, yet can slip into vicious blood lust when the situation becomes violent, and Blanchett nails it.  This is a huge step up from the femme fatale of Last Crusade, and I appreciate how Blanchett's gender is not overly sexualized for the benefit of enticing male audiences.  She wears a crisp uniform that doesn't highlight her sex, and is quick to draw a rapier when she needs her captives to comply.  Never does she flirt with Indy, nor does she waste much time in classic villain mistakes such as rambling about her plans.  This is a serious female character that is treated seriously by the script, and Spielberg's direction, which cannot be said for 95% of Hollywood's attempts at female villains.  I think this character is one of the most sorely overlooked aspects of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.<br /><br />And this brings me to a character many have criticized the film for...Shia LaBeouf as Mutt Williams, a 1950s greaser who drives a motorcycle, wears a leather jacket, talks smack, and is quick to draw a switchblade.  Now, let me get this straight:  I hate, and I do mean HATE most of the work of Shia LaBeouf.  He has had roles where I've liked him (Holes) but for the most part he's one of the most annoying male actors I've ever seen.  Almost every role he's ever had he spends panicking, overacting, and stammering like a madman and it is enough to make the ears bleed!  The Transformers movies alone almost made me want to smack the annoying twerp upside the head with a mallet, if only to momentarily shut him up...luckily for Shia, and to the surprise of those who may be reading this: I actually liked his performance in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  In fact, I honestly forgot at times he was the actor playing Mutt.  It's a nice performance, that really did combine honest character acting with a bit of camp that poked fun of 1950s teenage culture, and I really do think he gave perhaps the best performance of his career thus far (not saying too much, but hey: when Transformers is the alternative, this is a huge improvement).<br /><br />No, instead of Shia, the most annoying character in the film is Mac (Ray Winstone), Indy's traitorous former colleague.  Above all the nitpicks such as the refrigerator, and CGI, that so many fans complain about, this is the one aspect of the movie that annoys me above all other errors.  Winstone plays the part well enough, but the scripting is horrible.  He betrays Indy multiple times in the movie, and yet Indy trusts him whenever he comes up with some weak story to explain how he's been on Indy's side the whole time...only to betray him again five minutes later.  Once or twice I might have let this slide, but by the third time it made me want to scream "COME ON, INDIANA!"  Indy in the old films would have never made this mistake three times.<br /><br />I think the film has some really great action, and set pieces, but there are some moments that really make it clear why so many people hate this film.  CGI gophers, a dreadful vine swinging sequence (I get it's a homage to Tarzan, but what makes me draw the line on "Based on serials" as an excuse for the movie's actions, this still a poorly  thought out idea that could have easily been cut), and of course the refrigerator (in all fairness, my reaction to this moment was the same as when Indy survived the raft in Temple of Doom), but quite frankly...when have the Indiana Jones films made much sense?  Despite the amazing intro, and one of the best final actions sequences in movie history, Temple of Doom was just as riddled with flaws as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  I think many people really were trying to count the ways this new film couldn't live up to the originals, and due to the original films being classic, everyone put a magnifying glass to every flaw.<br /><br />Aside from the moments mentioned above, I believe CGI was used effectively, and, honestly: it was 2008.  Would it have been awesome if Spielberg filmed the entire movie with the same methods as the he used in the 1980s?  Without a doubt, but to expect that is just being too harsh.  It would have been better, but for what we get there is plenty of good stuff here.  A motorcycle chase that uses real stuntmen with occasional effects to make it seem as if Harrison Ford and Shia LaBeouf are actually there, a great car chase through the South American rainforest (I know, CGI isn't as thrilling as, but there are real parts sprinkled throughout, and you know what: actually doing an action-chase through dense rainforest would have been suicidal, so I fully understand the use of CGI), but most importantly: Temples and tombs.  That isn't CGI, and the team did a great job creating enormous set pieces for Indy and his companions to explore.  Also great is a series of thirteen crystal skeletons modeled personally by the late and great Stan Winston.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg and George Lucas created Indy as a tribute to the Saturday morning serials they grew up with and it seems to have always been a labor of love for the pair.  The first three films took place in the 1930s and reflected it.  Now, twenty years later, Harrison Ford's age dictated an older Indy so the setting moved to 1950s.  Indy, having always been a creation of Spielberg and Lucas' nostalgia for the films of their youth, shifted from the more serious 1930s treasure hunter serials to the more fantastical, implausible series and movies of the 1950s.  This isn't betraying the fans, this is two friends remembering why they created this character in the first place and it just happens that this may seriously annoy the fans who wanted a far more serious Indy movie.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not as good as the classic trilogy, and people who go in expected it to live up to its predecessors have set themselves out for disappointment.  Yes, it would have been great if this new movie could have at least lived up to Last Crusade, but I was just happy to see Indy on the big screen again.  Indiana Jones has always been based on the fun B-movies that Spielberg and Lucas love, and in that regard I believe Kingdom of the Crystal Skull accomplished what it set out to do: be a light popcorn entertainment that transports the viewer back to a time when movies weren't so obsessed with being edgy or "Realistic."  As for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I'm happy that Lucas and Spielberg understand what makes an entertaining action movie.  This will never be a classic like the original trilogy, but for me it succeeded at its primary goal:  Entertainment.<br /><br />When Kingdom of the Crystal Skull got dumb it got really dumb, but those moments passed by so fast I was easily able to forget them and enjoy watching the greatest action hero of all time do what he does best.</p></body></html>

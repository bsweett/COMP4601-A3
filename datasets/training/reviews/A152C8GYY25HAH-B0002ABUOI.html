Whether the remake is as good as the original depends on how your criteria.<br /><br />Technology has made incredible advances in the 26 years since the original's release. The new version, fueled by tens of millions of dollars in financial backing, is a special effects bonanza. In the old days, it was difficult to set up a scene in which a truck ran over one victim. Today, it's easy enough to show five or six victims run down in as many seconds - all digitally, of course. . Less is more has become more is more.<br /><br />The original had a budget of only a few hundred thousand dollars. It was a classic example of the idea that "one's success is based upon one's ability to improvise." Viewed as an example of a low budget movie, Romero's "Dawn of the Dead" succeeded brilliantly.<br /><br />Despite it's technological superiority, this version suffers from the fact that, by definition, it can not be original. The best that can be said of it is that it might be the definitive version of Romero's story, if only he had had the money to make it this way.<br /><br />Having said all that, today's version is entertaining. The story of a killer virus turning people into cannibalistic zombies remains virtually the same. As in the original, the central characters are a band of survivors who hole up in a mall. Their guns and their machismo may be bigger, but their plight is just as hopeless.<br /><br />The new "Dawn of the Dead" should prove exciting and innovative to those who never saw the first one. Those who did see the 1978 version might be a bit disappointed.</p></body></html>

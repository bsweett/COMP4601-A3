<meta name="summary" content="A good anti-Western"></head><body><p>Eastwood has turned in a good Western here, even though the theme is anti-Western, and he plays an anti-hero.<p><p>The plot is well covered by other reviewers.  A ... is attacked and disfigured by a couple of local cowhands, and the madam and her girls raise a bounty and hire Munny (Eastwood) and his sidekicks to kill them.  And, they do.<p><p>That's the gist of it.  The movie is earthy.  The bad guy, for example, is killed while using the outhouse.  An undignified end, which is exactly what he deserves.<p><p>No heroism here.  No shining knight on a white charger.  Instead, you get the feeling of realism, which is what director Eastwood was certainly after.<p><p>Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<p></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding in every detail, a masterpiece of cinema"></head><body><p>Francis Ford Coppola directed an absolute masterpiece on film when he made the immortal classic &quot;The Godfather&quot;, which was adapted from Mario Puzo's best selling book about the inner working and ordeals of the Corleone Family who was head of the powerful Mafia organization. An excellent screenplay, excellent actors and excellent cinematography makes this one of the best films ever produced and its not hard to see why.<p>The film stars Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone aka &quot;The Godfather&quot;, Al Pacino as The Godfather's son Michael, James Caan as Sonny who is The Godfather's eldest son and heir apparent, John Cazale as Fredo, the &quot;innocent&quot; son of Vito Corleone, Talia Shire as Connie the daughter and last but not least Robert Duvall as &quot;Tom Hagen&quot; as the adviser to the Don.  The rest of the supporting cast is outstanding as well.<p>The screenplay is faithful to the storyline of the book, which excludes some chapters from the novel, however this doesn't diminish the movie in anyway.  It is a story, ultimately a tragic one, about the powerful Corleone Family and the internal strife, struggle, loyalty and love mixed in with a need for power ultimately makes victims of all members of the family.  I am sure all who have seen the movie know the plot well, and for those who havent seen the movie, I wont spoil any of it, since it is a movie &quot;you cant refuse&quot; to see.  The ultimate lesson of the movie in my opinion is &quot;Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely&quot;.<p>The characters in the movie are supposedly based on real life Mafioso's such as real Gambino crime boss Sam &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Giancana is the inspiration for Vito Corleone and Johnny Fontaine is based on Frank Sinatra as it will be easy to see when the viewer watches the movie.<p>This is a true classic in every sense of the word and I can't recommend it highly enough for those who enjoy classic movies and movies that last throughout time.  This is only the opening chapter however and there are two more movies (Godfather II and III) in this incredible saga that are just as brilliant as this one and I highly recommend that they be viewed as well to see the ultimate tragedy of the Corleone Family.</p></body></html>

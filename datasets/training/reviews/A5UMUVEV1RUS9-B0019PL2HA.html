<meta name="summary" content="NASCAR fans will love it; Ferrell fans too"></head><body><p>I'm a huge NASCAR fan, so when I saw they were releasing this movie, I grabbed my other fellow NASCAR friends and headed to the theater. It was just what I needed to escape from my life (I'm going through a hard time right now) and despite my being depressed, Talladega Nights made me laugh just to spite myself. Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) has always wanted to go fast since he was a kid. Now as an adult, he and his best friend, together "Shake N' Bake," work the pit for one of the cars. But the driver is unmotivated and won't get back into the car after he has to use the bathroom, so Ricky Bobby offers to hop in and finish the race. Soon, he makes a name for himself and all of NASCAR knows Ricky Bobby as a champion. But soon, his perfect life begins to crumble away from his perfect wife, to his best friend, even to on the track with a French race car driver. I certainly don't want to spoil it, but for NASCAR fans, you'll be happy to see DW (my personal favorite NASCAR announcer) and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. among other familiar NASCAR faces. I venture to say that even people who aren't very interested in NASCAR would enjoy this, if they enjoy Ferrell's other movies. It's fun and not meant to be taken too seriously. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

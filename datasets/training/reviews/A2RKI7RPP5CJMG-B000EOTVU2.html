<meta name="summary" content="Finally, A Few Smart Victims!!"></head><body><p>I really don't know how much of "Wolf Creek" is actually based on the Backpacker Killer of Australia, but even if a tinge of it is true, it makes for a good horror tale.  Mind you, this isn't your typical hack n' slash Freddy or Jason flick, this film is about a demented man who just enjoys torturing and killing people.  There is some gore, but I've seen a lot worse.  Besides, gore doesn't make a movie scary, it's the PLOT that makes it scary.<br /><br />A number of things set "Wolf Creek" apart from your average horror flick.  For one, there are only three characters who become potential victims.  Our killer doesn't have a huge party or some wild bunch of teenage idiots to work with.  He's only got three, and he makes the most of it.  Also, we get to learn quite a deal about our three victims.  Cassandra Macgrath heads up the group of backpackers and she takes on the primary heroine role in the film.  Nathan Phillips plays her would-be love interest and Kestie Morassi hits the trail looking like a young and somewhat prettier Christina Applegate(perhaps the accent gives her that "something extra").  John Jarratt plays Mick Taylor, our prime suspect.  Relax, I haven't given anything away by fingering Jarratt as the killer, it's almost obvious when he hits the screen.  He's almost too likeable and friendly at first for the average viewer to think of him as anything else.  He does sort of look like old Roscoe P. Coltrane from the "Dukes of Hazzard" TV series, so that kind of took the edge off of him for me.  No matter, the entire cast did a wonderful and convincing job.<br /><br />The story sounds rather stereotypical of the horror genre:  friends trek off for a weekend of fun and end up being systematically tortured and killed.  Though it isn't quite as relentless as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," I can see the similarities in the cruel and garish actions of the villain.  The back of the DVD case compares this flick to "The Blair Witch Project," which I feel is a disservice to "Wolf Creek."  This is a much better film.  I didn't care when things happened to the jerks in "Blair Witch," but I did pull for the victims in "Wolf Creek."<br /><br />Overall, if you're a fan of horror along the "Texas Chainsaw" line, you'll enjoy this flick.  If you think scary is defined by the body count, stay away.<br /><br />One other thing, I was amazed at how intelligent the characters were in this film.  They actually defended themselves and attempted to escape.  Only one character got a little too sure of themself, but I think that was due more to delirium than attitude.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

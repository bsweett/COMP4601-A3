<meta name="summary" content="By the Beard of Zeus! An Anchorman Review!"></head><body><p>Anchorman is the story of Ron Burgundy and his legacy as an anchorman on the channel 4 news time that frequents the number one spot in the ratings. His news team includes the sports newscaster, Champ Kind, the investigative reporter, Brian Fantana, and the weatherman, Brick Tamland. In this era of newscasting, only men were allowed to read the news. So what'll happen when Veronica Corningstone enters the picture? A woman who has the experience and the dream of becoming a network anchor. Will that dream come true? As Bob Dylan said, "the times they are a'changin'." Anything can happen and it's something you're going to have to deal with.<br /><br />Reviewing Anchorman is more difficult than it looks. While it's one of my favorite movies, it's so incredibly random. There is a plot, but it takes a backseat to the memorable and hysterical one-liners from the film that had to be improvised at times. With a movie that's this spontaneous, it's a bit hard to comment on things like the story since it's kind of minimal in a movie like this. The actors who make up the channel four news team portray these characters pretty flawlessly in the film though. They're pretty absorbed in these roles and that's a good thing. It makes this ridiculous movie somewhat believable.<br /><br />Now I've been a Will Ferrell fan for quite awhile now. He's made some pretty hilarious movies in his career, but this one was the last comedy he did that I really enjoyed. Every comedy he's done after this followed the same kind of formula; little plot and a lot of random one-liners and jokes that seemed to come out nowhere. It's funny the first time around and decent the second time, but after that it gets really redundant. People may find that flaw with this film, but I personally enjoyed it. The movie has almost a cult status for its ridiculousness alone. It's not only a film that continued my appreciation for Will Ferrell, but made me a fan of Paul Rudd as well.<br /><br />Anchorman isn't really a movie for everyone. If you're looking for a film that has a good story, a lot of character development, or a steady buildup towards anything worthwhile then this isn't the movie for you. This is the type of movie that is designed just to make you laugh. You're not really supposed to think about what's happening or why it's happening. You're just supposed to have fun with it and enjoy the moment at hand. If you can follow something like Family Guy and laugh at the humor in that, then you shouldn't have a problem with Anchorman. You'll enjoy the comedy for what it is and like it says in the narration at the beginning of the film, you'll probably wind up thinking...one anchorman was more man then the rest. His name was Ron Burgundy. He was like a god walking amongst mere mortals. He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo. In other words, Ron Burgundy was the balls.</p></body></html>

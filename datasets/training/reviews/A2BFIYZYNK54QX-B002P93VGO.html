<meta name="summary" content="Not nearly as bad as THE LAST STAND."></head><body><p>I saw it recently expecting one of the worst films ever made (like X-MEN: THE LAST STAND) and I was mildly surprised. I think that surprise was due to the fact that I had EXTREMELY low expectations. It's interesting to see so many characters in this film that are part of the X-Universe in some way, from Blob to Emma Frost to Deadpool, but waaaay too much of this film is either aped completely from other films (Agent Zero's gun skills are essentially cribbed from the far superior EQUILIBRIUM, and a drug inducing a death-like state of a loved one? Read any Shakespeare lately?) or the film has plot holes the size of The Milky Way. Seriously... an Adamantium bullet? THAT'S how you can explain something like the ending of this film? Ugh. The biggest mistake that director Gavin Hood and the writing team made was not really keeping with James Howlett's actual origin, which would have been a film in and of itself if they had adapted the graphic novel ORIGIN, but they decided to do a REALLY short adaptation of it: The opening five minutes. And then they went berserk with mutant mayhem. And the mayhem isn't so much the action or the story; it turned into a game: How many obscure mutants can we fit into one film?<br /><br />The other game that it turned into was how can we create a spinoff for Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool? Like that's a character that needs its own film, especially after what they did to him in this film.<br /><br />There are cool moments in the film, and moments that made me smile, and Hugh Jackman is very cool as Logan. So, again... not so bad that it made me want to punch everyone involved, like THE LAST STAND did, but not so good as to rank amongst the really-good-ness of the first film or the sheer genius of X-MEN UNITED. 3 out of 5 is a decent score if you expect NOTHING from this film other than some cool action and Jackman's wife-beater posturing.</p></body></html>

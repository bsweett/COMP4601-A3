<meta name="summary" content="Not As Scary As Many Made It Out To Be....(2.5 stars)"></head><body><p>A lot of people were making this out to be truly and utterly scary...and I don't see it. I hardly was scared in this film- grossed out yes sometimes but not scared. And this movie was claimed as gorey when it wasn't even that. Don't believe that fellow readers it is hardly gorey. Yet that's a good thing for me because I hate movies that overdo the gore. Yes the point is the movie did not keep me on the edge of my seat, mainly because in the beginning it dragged somewhat and made me grow bored. The movie lost points in the beginning definitely.<br /><br />Now when they finally get put into this old sick man's world then you get worried for the kids who are obviously in deep danger so this gets you interested in how they will survive and constantly are yelling to the screen to run or other things like that.<br /><br />Yet somehow the movie still wasn't amazing. Maybe it's the way it was acted out(the actors are not too amazing), maybe the plot I felt could have been written better- and overall I think my deep disappointment was the end. That wasn't much of an ending, and you don't really know what happened truly and a lot of the movie isn't nothing but a story it merely was a drawing on the aspects on many of the backpack murders that's all. A lot of people like the movie better assuming this is a truly what happened to these kids, when it isn't. There isn't much you can know of what happened, that's what the end tells you mainly. Like someone else said it is a poor showing of what really happened and that's what overall hurt the movie to me. It just wasn't amazing- just an average horror/ thriller and that's all. You want to try it out, go ahead, but don't be surprised if it doesn't live up to the hype people such as Quentin Tarantino puts it up to.</p></body></html>

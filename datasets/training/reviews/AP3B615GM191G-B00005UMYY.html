Remarkably, however, I somehow missed this incredible piece of film-making until now.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Memento" tells the story of an amnesiac who cannot remember short-term events.  He knows who is and basic tenants of his life, but the day-to-day details reset from time to time.  Thus, this film is devoted to him trying to avenge his wife's killing and putting together the pieces of his confusing identity.<br /><br />There is not other way to describe this movie apart from saying there are few like it.  The closest comparison would be to "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", but "Memento" is better at that game.  The story is told in such a unique fashion that it will keep you guessing (but in a good way) until the very end.  The acting is also solid and makes you truly care about the 2-3 core characters.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give this film, however, is that it accomplishes the feat of bending the mind yet ultimately creating a remarkably cohesive overall story.  I was taken on a psychological adventure and given an ending worthy of the journey.  You won't be left hanging, that is for sure.<br /><br />Thus, "Memento" is now firmly ensconced on my "Top Films" list.  There's nothing it fails at, while succeeding at so many other things.  If you (like me) have waited this long to view this gem, it's time.</p></body></html>

Her family consists of a nerotic father, a gay uncle, a foul-mouthed grandfather, and a brother who has taken a vow of silence.  They pile into a VW van which has as many quirks as the family, and head off for California so that Olive can live out her dream.  There are over-the-top moments, some of which are funny and some of which are merely tasteless.  The most heartwarming moment in the film occurs when the family has a rare show of solidarity when they serve as back-up dancers for Olive, who is doing a dance number which was unfortunately choreographed by her grandfather.  Olive is a refreshing contrast to the Jon Benet Ramsey look-alikes she is competing against, but this movie was still a bit over-the-top for me.</p></body></html>

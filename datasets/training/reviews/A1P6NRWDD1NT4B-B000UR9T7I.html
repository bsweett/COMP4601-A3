Again, the heart of the film is the relationship of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson (Tobey McGuire & Kirsten Dunst) and this has been been the driving force of the film series. Each film has been emotionally powerful because of this. However, it might have slightly weighted down this film which is a minor complaint to this reviewer.  It didn't allow the full development of Eddie Brock/Venom (Topher Grace) and Sandman/Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church). However, whatever screen time they had, their characterizations were excellent. Once again, another key character in the film series is Peter Parker's Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) as Spider-Man's voice of reason.  It's great that the creators of this film series have had the insight to carry over this element from the comics and use it in all three films (even the use of Ben Parker --Cliff Roberston--in flashback sequences). Rosemay Harris as Aunt May has been so good in all three films. SPIDER-MAN 3 had a lot to prove because SPIDER-MAN 2 was such a great film and this film had a lot of information to sift through. Such elements that were added to the plot was resolving the issues of the Peter Parker/Harry Osborn conflict and the real story behind the death of Ben Parker.  Another minor plot complaint is how the alien symbiote just happens to conveniently find Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Then again, this is a film based on a comic book and these type of coincidences happen all the time. The scenes with Peter and the symbiote provide a bit of comic respite in the film between all the mayhem. Tobey McGuire and his portrayal of Peter Parker/Spider-Man is probably one of the best comic-book casting adapations to the screen. Overall, SPIDER-MAN 3 is a very entertaining and satisfying film. The action and special effects were once again excellent, and the casting was great. Also, with all the plot elements in the story, this film, as in the first two, had another very emotional third act.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MISCHIEVOUSLY CLEVER AND SLICK SCI-FI SATIRE"></head><body><p>If you have seen the earlier episodes of &quot;Futurama&quot;, you'll know how effective a cleverly done sci-fi satire can be. <p>Galaxy Quest mines a shuttle-full of sci-fi cliches for its banter, and while I don't remember anything laugh-out-loud rip-roarious, there is a good deal of congenial charm that permeates throughout. Which makes it a perfect family flick to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon. <p>Apart from the spoof gags, what took me by surprise were the superb special effects, as octopodal aliens morph effortlessly into humans and back again in articulately designed space (the interior of the spaceship itself borrowed its staid cardboard looks from Star Trek of yore, perhaps as an intentional sardonic effect)<p>Overall, the film's affection for its audience (especially those weaned on Lost in Space, or The Next Generation, etc) and for the characters it parodies covers up for the gaping blackholes in its highly implausible and goofy plotline. <p>Great rental, and even a good buy because it lends itself easily to repeat viewing.</p></body></html>

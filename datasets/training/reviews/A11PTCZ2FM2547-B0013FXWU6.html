Folks, Daniel Day-Lewis is as brilliant as he is mesmerizing as ambitious oilman Daniel Plainview in THERE WILL BE BLOOD, a powerful film depicting the oil industry in the infancy of the 20th Century.  Over the span of about 30 years, we see Plainview transform from a smooth-talking salesman to a vicious, greedy tycoon; the common theme throughout this transformation is Plainview's utter contempt for his fellow man.  No one--not even his own blood--is worthy, especially if they happen to get in Plainview's way.<br /><br />Day-Lewis is riveting playing such an odious, contemptible character; whether he's feigning compassion or committing cold-blooded crimes he's totally convincing and believable.  This film is a one-man show, as Day-Lewis completely dominates every scene he's in--not in an overbearing manner, but masterfully and brilliantly.  That's not to say the supporting cast isn't up to par, because it is; led by Paul Dano playing a young faith healer with a most annoying girlish scream, the cast augments Day-Lewis's performance.  Honorable mention goes to Kevin J. O'Connor playing Plainview's long lost brother Henry.<br /><br />THERE WILL BE BLOOD is a finely crafted film featuring award-winning cinematography by Robert Elswit and a most haunting musical score by Jonny Greenwood.  Haunting is a great word to describe this film; stunning yet another, as Day-Lewis delivers a most disagreeable character via an exceptional performance.  See this movie!<br />--D.

However, my family will all watch Jaws over and over at least once a year, so go figure.<br /><br />My cool anecdote about Jaws is from a couple of weeks after it came out, I was skin diving near Newport Beach, and as we swam out from shore, the sea weed was swaying in the water, my friend and I both looked at each other at the same time and through our snorkels, we sang "Doo, doo, doo-doo" That day they caught a baby Great White between where we were and Catalina Island, the next day a world record Great White off of Catalina. It did keep us out of the water the rest of the week!<br /><br />So here's the deal, this is a scary movie, but don't look too close at the special effects, as they are pretty cheesy by today's standards, and on a side note, Myth Busters tried to re- create the Blow Up scene... Myth busted!</p></body></html>

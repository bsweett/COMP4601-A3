<meta name="summary" content="Stunning Vampire Flick"></head><body><p>Move over, Blade:  there's a new girl in town.  Kate Beckinsdale plays a vampire assassin who kills werewolves in an ongoing, ages-old feud between the two groups of nightime dwellers.  Although she is a member of a clan, she doesn't really feels she fits in, and spurns the affections of the young and handsome  next would-be leader of her clan.  The only one she has complete respect and adoration for is her ancient sire.  Things start to change when she finds out more about the true reason the two groups are fighting, and falls in love with a human caught in the crossfire.  This relationship lends a Romeo & Juliet aspect to the film.<p>Set in a modern Romanian city,  Underworld is an orgy of extremely violent action between the decadent vampires and the Spartan werewolves.  Supercool, with great acting, gorgeous sets, and KB in a skintight leather suit with kool boots, Underworld is a classic that I am proud to own.</p></body></html>

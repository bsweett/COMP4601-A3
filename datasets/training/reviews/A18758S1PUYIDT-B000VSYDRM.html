<meta name="summary" content="Goes on too long, but otherwise watchable"></head><body><p>The long slo-mos and wide shots are not always necessary.  But it is a fascinating, disturbing and certainly original story.  You can practically detect the scents as the murderer learns the art of perfume-making from a master, and as the former breathes in the fragrance of the young women he ends up killing in a desire to capture their unique scents forever.<br />  I don't think I would have cast Hoffman in the role of Baldini--his accent was too slippery and he didn't look quite right in the role.  But the others fared far better.<br />I am now curious to read the novel.</p></body></html>

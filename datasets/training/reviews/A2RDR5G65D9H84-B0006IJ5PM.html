The Panthers are a high school football team from Odessa, Texas, that at the start of the season looks like the strongest candidate to take the state championship. The high hopes are based in great part on the presence of Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) and his incredible ability for playing football. Not only can he play his position, running back, in excellent fashion, but he can also pass, receive, block, you name it. The offers from the most prestigious universities are pouring in, and he is at the top of the world. But everything comes tumbling down for him and for the Panthers when he gets a knee injury in the first game of the season.<br /><br />Now the responsibility falls on the shoulders of the rest of the team: an average quarterback, a supporting cast that was used to being "carried" by the star, and a coach that some people think is earning a salary that is too high. The burden is even larger, since each player has personal issues he has to deal with. For example, the QB Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) has to take care of his sick mother who has mental problems. Others have to endure the abuse by their fathers, who see themselves in the kids and push them beyond their limits.<br /><br />The movie succeeds in showing the significance of teamwork and of how important it is to believe on yourself. It also shows that in some town across the US, football is almost the only thing that counts, and high school kids end up carrying the hopes and dreams of the whole population, which given their age and maturity level may be considered unfair. A similar picture is presented in John Grisham book "Bleachers".<br /><br />As to the acting, the only person worth pointing out is Billy Bob Thornton, who as usual delivers a high quality performance. Luke and Black are the other actors that get a fair amount of "acting" time and provide us with acceptable performances. This is a good movie but it is definitely not among the best football films out there. 3.5 stars</p></body></html>

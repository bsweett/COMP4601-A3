Entertaining, basically a good summer popcorn film.  Sure you have to suspend your disbelief at the door -- but really, any movie of this type requires that.  A better film than X-MEN 3.  True, it doesn't have Famke Janssen but there is something equally beautiful, the very alluring Lynn Collins.  If you like comic movies a good one to have.</p></body></html>

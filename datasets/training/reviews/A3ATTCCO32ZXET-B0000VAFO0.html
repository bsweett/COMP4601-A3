<meta name="summary" content="All I ever needed to know about assembling a vampire coven.."></head><body><p>...I learned from Underworld.<br />It has been a most educational experience, watching Underworld.  Until now I was walking around with some very laughable ideas about the Creatures of the Night that we all so take for granted as the pedestrian kind of beings that populate folklore.  From here on out I am enlightened; no longer a gullible moviegoer, or naive reader.  I can rely on the sophistication I have gleaned from this movie to move forward with confidence among the Undead.  Underworld set me straight.<p>For example, not just anybody has what it takes to become a vampire.  The first requirement for immortality is a European accent.  In fact, British and French accented vampires seem to be the most prolific, regardless of residence.  It would be considered extremely gauche for, say, a Texan accent to show up at one of the black tie coven soirees even if he sported the hippest Versace lace cravat.  Next, one must be a model.  This means high cheekbones, gauntly thin, and with a nose constantly in the air as one's lips form a slight pout in resting state.  Only the alpha females are allowed to have larger bustlines; this is so that those black leather designer fashions will drape nicely.  But above all, a vampire must have that cultivated air of aloof that can be obtained by constantly imagining an offensive odor.<p>Now werewolves have to be selected from an entirely different lot.  The master werewolf of Underworld must have scoured every biker bar in LA for swarthy males that with the proper ear hair.  Sideburns and a pointy unibrow will gain you extra points for consideration as well.  Blondes need not apply, as the lupine fashion seems to favor the swarthy look.  Fortunately for Americans, there is less discrimination here with regards to accent.  But make no mistake, the world of werewolves is a male dominated culture - women are for snacking only.  <p>If your taste runs to the slaying side of things you should know that wooden stakes are pass&eacute;.  Please.  Nowadays you will need automatic weaponry and explosive munitions.  Also, be aware that vampires and werewolves alike must have kept up on action flicks because now they have advanced martial art skills upon conversion and can unload seven clips worth of ammo into their foes without reloading.  And did you think vamps were the only ones who could run on walls and ceilings?  It's not just for Eurofrogs anymore.  <p>Some further rules to keep in mind when cavorting with Underworld denizens are:<br />No athletic shoes.  No pastel or white clothing.<br />When in doubt, leather<br />Waterford crystal is the vessel of choice for blood-tasting parties.<br />Bottom line, this is an entertaining action flick that should appeal to those who like movies like Blade.  You can enjoy it if you keep that in mind.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="CRAZY IS AS CRAZY DOES"></head><body><p>As a life long fan of horror films I have long been a defender of director George Romero. Even the movies he's made that I'm not particularly fond of I've enjoyed for the originality if nothing else. Add to that the fact that this man has made movies outside of the mainstream of mass manufactured Hollywood and how can you not like him? So I was kind of worried when I heard they were going to remake his 1973 film THE CRAZIES. The fear was unwarranted.<br /><br />The movie takes place in a small Midwestern town in Iowa where life is like a Norman Rockwell painting. People know one another, festivals are planned and everyone in town is gathered at the baseball diamond for the local high school match, including Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant). So what's the town to think when a local man wanders out onto the field carrying a shotgun and refusing to step down when the Sheriff orders him to drop his weapon? After leveling the gun at the crowd, he has no option left but to shoot the man.<br /><br />This leaves Dutton wondering what ever possessed this man to act the way he did. But it doesn't stop there. That night another regular town's person terrorizes his family. Locking them inside a closet, he pours gasoline all over and lights the place ablaze. Taken in to custody, the questions keep coming...what's wrong with these people?<br /><br />A little investigating on the part of Dutton and his deputy leads them to a swamp where a few poachers came across a body in a parachute hanging from a tree. Looking further into the swamp, Dutton and his group come across a large airplane sunk beneath the surface of the water and no clue as to where it came from or how it got here.<br /><br />Things go from bad to worse as more outbreaks of strange, violent behavior happen. Cars are wrecked up and down the street and folks are killing one another for no apparent reason. Dutton, his wife and the town doctor Judy (Radha Mitchell), Deputy Russell (Joe Anderson) and nurse Becca (Danielle Panabaker) attempt to leave town only to be apprehended by the military.<br /><br />It turns out that on board the plane was a toxic agent, code name Trixie (a reference to the original film), that would create mass madness if released. The contagion seeped into the town's water supply and everyone who had something to drink was infected. Now the military is sorting out who is and who isn't infected with nothing else to do but kill those who are.<br /><br />An escape ensues and the foursome head out to escape not just the military but the by now infected zombie like people they once knew as friends. But the military doesn't want to risk the chance of the outbreak spreading and a hunt for the fugitives follows.<br /><br />This movie offers a few scares that few seem to do these days. It doesn't really on gross out gore, though it features some, but more on the whole "what if..." scenario posed by the main idea. What would you do if your neighbors, people you had been friends with for years or even family members suddenly decided you'd be better off dead? How would you react to these attacks? And what would you do if the government was involved in not solving the problem without resorting to incredible violence?<br /><br />The horror in this story involves people and humanity.  Knowing that people you care for are now something they weren't and yet still having deep rooted emotions for them makes for some powerful thoughts when it comes to deciding what to do.<br /><br />The film offers some well done special effects that don't always go over the top but that should be enough to keep gore hounds happy and average viewers revolted but not too turned off to the story. The acting is top of the line and Olyphant is fast becoming an actor that we're bound to see more of.<br /><br />One of the good things about a remake that works is that it makes viewers who might not been aware of the original source material seek it out. In this case both movies would offer an evenings entertainment for whatever price paid. This movie is one of those rare films, a remake that not only pays homage to its source material, but an enjoyable movie in its own right.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What do you get when to sign on a nice cast,  a bit of wit.."></head><body><p>..in your script, and a poorly executed plot line? A box office homerun! That's right, for all the hype this film received in its movie previews and constant raving reviews from shows like EXTRA and Entertainment Tonight, the film misses the mark in a huge way.  Is it still entertaining? You betcha! But anytime you have Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, and at least six other notables in a film, you're gonna have some entertainment, even if it comes across as a bit shallow.<p>  Ocean's Eleven is a remake of a perfectly good classic film. As was the case with the original, we have a long line of familiar faces and names in the modern version. Eleven crooks are attempting to pull of the biggest theft scam in the history of robberies. Well, let's just say that if you like predictable films featuring some of the most overhyped names in Hollywood, this will be the perfect film for you. <p>I will note this: this is a good film to relax to. In other words, this film requires absolutely no messages for the viewer to ponder upon. It is a easy film to watch.</p></body></html>

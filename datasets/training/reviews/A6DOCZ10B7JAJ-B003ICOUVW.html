With this latest were-adaption we've got a monstrous budget, an outstanding cast, and a classic wolf script to feed on.  But somehow this Hollywood serving just doesn't come close to appeasing that voracious wolfman appetite.<br /><br />It's not a complete disaster, and I imagine that many mainstream horror fans will be slightly entertained.  There are some drab 19th century London sets that capture a nice depressing feel.  The costumes also capture that era quite well.  Plus there are some decent gory action scenes that deliver some solid thrills.  Some noticeable CGI, but overall the effects were somewhat gripping and realistic.<br /><br />Now for the bad.  This script was functional, at best.  The action is kinda slow-paced, with the dialogue sorta bland.  There's nothing too emotionally-charged or noteworthy happening whatsoever.  The acting performances in turn seemed very uninspired.  But really what pretty much ruined this movie for me were several plot developments that seemed eclipsed of all possible logic.  I won't include spoilers here, but some reactions to the disastrous werewolf problem seemed flat-out ridiculous.  There is a pointless romance that is clumsily included that's just atrocious.  And finally there is a horrible plot twist which is arbitrarily inserted that makes absolutely no sense.<br /><br />Not a complete waste.  But I'd recommend saving your money, or at least wait for a rental.  Pick up the almighty DOG SOLDIERS instead.</p></body></html>

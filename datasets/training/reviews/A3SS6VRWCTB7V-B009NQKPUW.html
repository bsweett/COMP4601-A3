Why did you sign up for this mess of a movie??? Special effects? So-so. Plot?? So-so. Overall, I think I hoped Scott could pull a rabbit out of his hat, but alas, no. I wished he could, I really do. But this movie is not in the same league as many, many, other SYFY movies by lesser known or celebrated directors. SO, all that said, perhaps not a bad movie rental. Date movie? I guess, maybe. Blah, wishes I could give it a good review but I just can't. Hope Scott does better next time.</p></body></html>

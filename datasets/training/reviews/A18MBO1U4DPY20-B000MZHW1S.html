<meta name="summary" content="Rather Underwhelming for a Leonardo DiCaprio Film"></head><body><p>Irrespective of what other critics/users say about this movie, I feel it lacked something. A lot of people have praised Di Caprio on his performance and some have has gone as far as saying this is his best performance, if not best film. I don't think Blood Diamond stacks up pretty well when you compare it to the last three films that Di Caprio has done. Namely - The Departed, Aviator and Catch Me If You Can. Now, let's talk about why I think this film fails.<br /><br />1. The story never really convinces one of it's message. My friend loved this movie but I just didn't feel it. The acting in the film was solid but the direction was rather tawdry. There were many action scenes that involved thrill in chase, capture, imprisonment, punishment, labor and death. However, nothing quite seemed to cement itself.<br /><br />2. Blood Diamond is a good film but it's just that. I don't think I will be recommending it to anyone. There are too many better films to watch. The subject is rather rewinded or should I just placidly state that I don't care. Or the script really doesn't make me care enough.<br /><br />3. I liked the end of the film. I'm used to absolutely loving the ends of film involving Di Caprio. Jennifer Connelly didn't act very well. Her character was sometimes incongruent to the script. The fact that I even question her performance is enough to highlight the lukewarm performance she gave.<br /><br />My favourite scene in the film involved Solomon winning an applause. But then, tell me, how many times have I seen scenes like that particular one in hollywood? Cynical as I am, I thought Djimon Hounsou acted very well. Di Caprio's character was predictable, at times funny and overall unimpressionable.<br /><br />Do Watch this film. But be open to the fact that some of you might not quite like it all that much. Of course I eagerly await Caprio's next film, Blink.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another dead live and eat everyone movie"></head><body><p>I wasn't sure what to expect when "Resident Evil" fired up, so my pre-conceived notions were minimal.  I've never played the game, and thus have no bias from that viewpoint.  To summarize the movie:  Another movie where a lot of people die and then come back to life, running around and attempting to eat everyone in sight.  How many times have we seen this plot?<p>Even though the plot is a retread that we've seen more times than we can count, there are a few nifty differences.  I loved the underground train.  I know.  What is the difference between the underground train and any subway?  In this case, it's the fact that it is under a house, leading to a top secret facility.  Furthermore, the train plays an important part in the end of the movie that has some top-notch special effects.  Some of the best special effects in the movie, in fact.<p>The hive was an interesting concept that the director spent just enough time on to provide a background for the plot, without spending so much time on it that you felt like it was time to go make popcorn.  I also liked the concept that Milla Jovovich and her male partner lost their memory and regained it throughout the movie.  However, the transition from memory loss to memory gain felt a bit jerky, and wasn't covered well by the pseudo-cool flashback sequences that weren't all that well done.  The best special effect was a super cutting laser effect that plays in a couple of deaths.<p>After these cool things, the movie is basically a bunch of people running around in zombie makeup trying to kill and eat the people still living.  There were places where the director tried to infuse a modern look into the movie by the way certain shots were set up and by laying a metal rock sound track to make everything seem more impressive than it really was.  Lastly was a heavy coating of blood on everything, as though that is sufficient to cover the spots where the creativity weakened.<p>I am glad I watched the movie, which will likely be the only time I ever watch it.  Not a terrible movie, but not terribly good either.  If you are relatively new to the zombie genre, you might find this movie interesting.  If you've seen very many of this movie's predecessors, such as "The Night of the Living Dead", "Dawn of the Dead", and the numerous imitators, then this movie will be same old, same old.  Unless you are a hard-core Resident Evil video game fan, or just love a gore-fest no matter how thin the plot behind it, then perhaps this is the movie for you.  All others, rent first, buy later.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="good, not great, story of alienation and connection"></head><body><p>This was a pretty good if not great story of a business traveler who spends almost all of his time on a plane--that is, when he isn't firing people or training others in how to do the same.  The film explores the lack of connection and empathy on his part in regard to the horrible job he has, and how others  can spend time with family while he has almost no one to spend time with except on a temporary basis.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this had so many nominations.  It's solid work from Clooney but certainly not his best role by any means.  His role in O Brother, Where Art Thou?  was much stronger and more substantial.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Darned good Sequel"></head><body><p>I haven't seen a sequel this good since Terminator 2! They really went back in history to give so much more storyline, or just added to the original story in such a clever way. They also did a great job in out-doing the killings from part 1! I was so intrigued by this movie I felt like I got my moneys worth in the first 20 minutes. The director did a great job of bringing you into his underworld. I like that Celine's love for Michael wasn't the only important part ot this story anymore. It isn't mostly centered on love like the first movie, however it is all there, from love, to the long history, to time jumping.<br /><br />I love this movie like I love giving my daughter anal!</p></body></html>

First of all, the story is so similar to The Shining,but without any of the things that made The Shining so great.  King was either fresh out of ideas when he wrote this one or he was working on a tight deadline .... Anyway, Depp is great and the only reason to see this film.  Bello, Hutton and Dutton have extended cameo roles that allow them to really do nothing. As the &quot;surprises&quot; are revealed they become more and more obvious and less and less interesting.  Why bother is the question that comes to mind.</p></body></html>

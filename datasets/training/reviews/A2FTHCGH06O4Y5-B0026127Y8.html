<meta name="summary" content="the kind of movie that gets you thinking"></head><body><p>Unfortunately, your thinking is all about how farcically preposterous the whole thing is.<br /><br />To be honest, there is nothing that Liam Neeson's character does during any 4-second interval of the film that is not believable.  Taking all his actions together, though; that's where the absurdity comes in.<br /><br />One might argue that this is meant to be a fast-paced thriller that will provide a couple of hours and entertainment and nothing more.  But for my part I couldn't lose myself in this movie on account of being unable to believe that Liam Neeson could be this sort of man, or that anybody in the world had such a skill set.<br /><br />I wonder what the French thought of this film:  it was almost an insult to their culture.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Manchurian Candidate: Strong Acting--Weak Logic"></head><body><p>When Major Marco (Denzel Washington) begins backtracking into the dim recesses of his mind that may have been tampered with by a global conglomerate, he finds that there is some solid truism to the movie cliche: "You know you are not paranoid when they really are out to kill you." A decade earlier, he and a congressman's son, Sgt. Shaw (Liev Schrieber) fight a winning battle with Iraqi insurgents with Shaw winning a medal for bravery.  At least that is the official army version. What happens from this point is a series of logical flaws that undercut the otherwise fine acting of Washington, Schrieber, and Meryl Streep in an over the top Hillary Clinton rant as the power hungry mother of Shaw.<br /><br />Marco believes that his entire patrol has been brainwashed for reasons that do not become clear until the film's close. What director Jonathan Demme tries mightily to do is to capture the relentless pressure that director John Frankenheimer managed to generate in the 1962 version of the original.  In this version, the focus was on the clash between a satirical poke at the political left and right that feared a communist was hiding under every bed. In the newer version, Demme substitutes a military-industrial conspiracy hodge-podge that replaces a red under each bed with a microchip in each cranium. The problem with such theories is that audience credibility  concerning the validity of the secrecy of such an all powerful group is strained when the number of conspirators exceeds the number of those killed by those same conspirators. Further muddying the plot is an odd Oedipal subtext concerning Streep and her film son Schrieber.  When a far too attractive and youngish Streep gets down on her knees in front of her semi-nude son and plants a non-motherly kiss on his lips, one shouts out: "Relevancy!"<br /><br />What is supposed to emerge from Demme's reworking of the Frankenheimer original is a cautionary tale about the dangers of allowing a shadow government to call the shots in deciding a nation's political destiny.  What actually does emerge is a pseudo-thriller that instead points to the need for current script writers to remember what passed for true suspense in the first place.</p></body></html>

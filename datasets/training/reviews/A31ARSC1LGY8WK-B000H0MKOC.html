<meta name="summary" content="Thank you for making this film Jason Rietman"></head><body><p>"Thank You for Smoking" is a superbly assured effort from first-time director Jason Rietman.<br /><br />Based on the book by Christopher Buckley, "Thank You for Smoking" tells the story of Nick Naylor, a big tobacco spin doctor who slowly comes to realise the error of his ways.<br /><br />Cleverly, Naylor - in a brilliant performance by Aaron Eckhart - is portayed as a likable guy - even at his most oily. The film lands solid punches on big tobacco executives, politicians, reporters, and of course lobbyists.<br /><br />"Thank You for Smoking" is a nice companion piece to "Fast Food Nation", which takes its aim at the fast food industry and if you loved that film you will love "Thank You for Smoking".</p></body></html>

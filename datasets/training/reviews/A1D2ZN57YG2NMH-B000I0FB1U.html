Who would have thought that a movie about a fat monk in a mexican orphanage who aspires to become a fighter would be such a great film!? Helmed by director Jared Hess, this film packs a great number of laughs and tons of classic one liners. Really, if you like terribly corny humor, done right, this is your movie.</p></body></html>

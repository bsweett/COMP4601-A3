There's been many bashing remarks about there being no story at all. Well, with a movie like this, a decent plot is really not an important thing. I'm amazed at anybody going into this movie expecting it. Have they been to a movie like this before?. The plot, what there is of it, has a bunch of storm chasers, led by the always appealing Helen Hunt, are trying to get a machine they've created into a twister so they can research them and let people know when and where a twister will land. Helen's ex, Bill Paxton, shows up with his fiance(the always underrated Jami Gertz)and they get sucked into the adventure as well. The special effects are, of course, out of this world brilliant. They are the real stars of this film. It's the kind of movie that will have you on the edge of your seat with pure, heart pounding excitement. And, really, that's a good thing to have. A lot of people bash these kinds of movies for just being simple entertainment. What a horrible world this would be without films like this. Anywho, the actors, including the great Carey Elwes, Alan(Spin City)Ruck, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, are all pretty decent. This is a wild ride that never stops!. Pure entertainment<br />and nothing more. It doesn't need to be.</p></body></html>

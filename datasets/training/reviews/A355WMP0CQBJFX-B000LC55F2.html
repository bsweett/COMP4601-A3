<meta name="summary" content="A WONDERFUL TRIO, AND A GREAT MAGIC FILM!!!"></head><body><p>the prestige is a magic treat, a love for magic so deep they sacrifice everything and anything to be the best. this is a keeper, the cast is great, the acting, the story, very suprising in the end. to win it all you have to lose it all. the cast alone you knew you were in for a treat. hugh jackman is one of the best actors out there. so down to earth, but has the hero thing about him. i love all of his movies and in this film his gift is clearly seen. christian bale is wonderful. he has a load of good movies under his belt as well. his acting speaks for itself, and his accent is nice. scarlett johanssen played her part very well. these men are trying to outdo each other ever since a tragic accident. niether wants to loose and that becomes their obsession. nothing else around them matters. and in the end only the best will triumph. sad at times. all it was said to be and more theres so much beauty and talent throughout the whole movie you just want to watch it again and again. i hugely applaud it.</p></body></html>

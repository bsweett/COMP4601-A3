June Carter Cash was a handsome women but not like Reese Witherspoon who is<br />extremely attractive (cute). That said both actors did remarkably excellent jobs singing. Cry Cry Cry was very effective. Two others Cocaine Blues & Get Rhythm are not heard very often. A lot of the movie was wasted on John's sophmoric pursuit of June. Sometimes he was married or she was married to someone else. It didn't matter to him. He begs her to marry him. It was childish & pathetic as portrayed. A very short movie without that nonsense. Of course the best parts were the stage performances of both of them. So, it's okay & I recommend it.</p></body></html>

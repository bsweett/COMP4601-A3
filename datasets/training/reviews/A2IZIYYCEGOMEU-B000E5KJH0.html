<meta name="summary" content="SAVED BY MACLAINE"></head><body><p>Don't get me wrong, the acting was good all around. The idea that a woman is so confused that she'll sleep with the guy that might be her father, grandfather, or both because she's having second thoughts about her own impending marriage seems a little less than funny, and the ending ( How pathetic could a man be? ) was a bit more than unbelievable. Rob Reiner must have been channeling his inner 'Lynch' when he chose to do this film ( although, David Lynch would have probably made a lot more sense of this mess of a script ).<br /><br />On the plus side there were some funny moments, and then there was Shirley MacLaine. She owned every scene she was in, and made a nearly mediocre movie ( despite it's great cast ) not only palatable, but entertaining.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hollywood's Enormous Trojan War Looks Amazing on Blu-Ray"></head><body><p>I'm really going to forgive some massive fundamental flaws and applaud this fun epic popcorn flick.  Obviously, and it is assumed that like many cinephiles, I have a major problem with Troy's very existence to the core.  Consider for a minute that the likes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W8OM5Y">Braveheart</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009PLLN6">Alexander</a> are called "historical fiction" but they are based on people we know existed.  Troy is based on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140275363">The Iliad </a> but it works in such a way that the audience is possibly being urged to believe these were real events.  So the film in essence is based on the possible events that took place during the Trojan War.  In fact, it doesn't even stay particularly true to The Iliad but it does try to capture the icons associated with the Trojan War and at the very least it keeps in tone with The Iliad, especially with regards to the violence in its battle sequences and the portrayal of Achilles' wrath.  However, no gods or mythical figures to speak of and that is, at the very least an indirect attempt to steer the audience from believing that this is fiction.  Maybe it is just because so many other epic films released are based on some degree of truth.  Troy is based on myths and that's alright if you want to portray it that way.  2004's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MQ58WC">King Arthur</a> had the same problem but with less CGI.  Troy has a lot of CGI and it cost $180 million to make.  They didn't need to stretch so far for believability but like I said, some movies are just worth forgiving.  This is eye candy; it is Hollywood to the bone.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I liked Troy and it looks incredible on blu-ray.  The director's cut includes extra battle cuts, extra nudity, and it even has some scenes that assist in character development.  The extra footage is actually seamless and makes the movie far longer but also far better and if there is an epic film made for superior visual technology like blu-ray, Troy is just that film.  There is no pretending here, Troy is a true Hollywood production and I actually mean that with at least some degree of affection.  The cast is great and includes of course Brad Pitt as the seemingly invincible and infinitely angry Achilles, Brian Cox as one of the film's real villains in Agamemnon, Eric Bana plays the heroic Trojan warrior Hector, Sean Bean plays Odysseus, Peter O'Toole plays Priam with fitting melodrama, Tyler Mane plays the chaotic and violent Ajax, and the very beautiful Diane Kruger plays Helen; the face that launched a thousand ships, or was it her breasts?  All are good in their roles but no one seems to take themselves too seriously and for the most part their performances, or in some cases just their presence, work within the film.<br /><br />The battle scenes in Troy are huge and absolutely second to none. There are tons of battle scenes within this 196 minute Director's cut and they just keep on going while getting more and more exciting and out of control.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000244F7I">soundtrack</a> for Troy is clearly an upgrade from the theatrical version and makes the battle scenes seem even larger as it booms and powers in and out of great sky shots over the beginnings, middles, and ends of various battles.  The cinematography and visual effects, whether the fake kind or the real kind, look absolutely amazing on blu-ray and the great shots never cease in Troy.  The music is huge, the drama is huge, and the visuals are even bigger.  It is visually one of the most impressive blu-rays so far and that is because it is a visually driven film to begin with.  Troy truly is epic in every sense of the word.  Well, except for that whole idea of it being based on an epic poem.</p></body></html>

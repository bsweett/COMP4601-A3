She's morose and bothered throughout, and it's hard to figure out if she actually loves her husband. The film is generally told in the 1st person, and Bullock is almost every scene. Those scenes that don't involve her are totally out of synch with the theory of the film. Director Mennan Yapo did his best, but it was an unformed script and everything was kind of left to the imagination of the general public (those who don't see the "holes"). Julian McMahon and Nia Long were fine, and the 2 little daughters gave great performances. As I said, it was good, mindless entertainment, but not a work of art. "The Forgotten" with Julianne Moore came to mind, and that  was a better movie. Entertaining but won't blow you out of the water. The acting is so good, it almost brings a tear to the eye. That's why I can't write it off.</p></body></html>

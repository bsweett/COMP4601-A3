<meta name="summary" content="Better than average but no match for "Sometimes In April""></head><body><p>Here is Hollywood's exploitation of the 1994 Rwandan genocide that raised Don Cheadle's Tinseltown status to the level of Clint Eastwood and Julie Roberts. By now you probably know it's about a hotelier that saved 1,000 people or so from extermination during the 1994 Tutsi-Hutu uprising.<br /><br />What you may not know is there is another contemporary film on the subject, "Sometimes In April", a made for cable flick from HBO, that in my opinion captures the action, politics and humanity of these events better than this one (see my Amazon review for more on that one).<br /><br />That's not to say this is an average film, for it is clearly better than average. But it is more of a Hollywood that real life production. While the crowd scenes and, especially, the scenes of refugees leaving the city were realistic, most of the violence on screen paled by the standard set in the other film, which concentrated more fully on the human outcomes than this one, which largely were constructed around the activities of one man, his work place, his relationships and family.<br /><br />One thing that irked me to no end watching this was seeling all the Rwandans speak English with an African accent. I checked out Wikipedia and learned that all Rwandans speak Kinyarwanda and share the same culture and religions.<br /><br />So why make a film that's supposed to be semi-documentary on a topic of international interest where, in effect, the Nazis speak English with a German accent? Because it's a Hollywood production, that's why. Sad but true, you know money makes the Hollywood world go round.<br /><br />If you rent this, try to rent "Sometimes In April" and make your own decision on which one better portrays this terrible story.</p></body></html>

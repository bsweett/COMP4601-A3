<meta name="summary" content="Atonement for the wrongs we do in our life time!!"></head><body><p>I started out thinking this was going to be another dumb war story.<br />To my surprise it turned to be one of the best movies I've seen in a while. A very good story about how you right the wrongs that you've done in your lifetime. This story takes place in England during World War II.<br />Asking if we really can right our wrongs is like asking, can you drive a vechile from New York to California on one tank of gas...NOT!!<br />But you will spend most of your life trying to ATONE for your wrongs!!<br />I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!</p></body></html>

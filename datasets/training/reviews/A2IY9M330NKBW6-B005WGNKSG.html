So I was in salivating mode when I popped this baby in the DVD player. Everything I'd heard about both the books and the movies was very positive.<br /><br />It was everything I'd hoped for. Just everything about this movie is so right.  The set up of the circumstance with Mikael's loss of the libel suet. Meeting Lisbeth and learning of her capabilities as a researcher. The hiring of Mikael for the investigation all happen the right way. You are into these people from the get go. When they start working with one another and these two seemingly opposites start to click it is something to behold. I won't re-tell the plot as many others have already done so, but this story unfolds like a blossoming flower. All the points are clever and well measured. And when there is the inevitable snowballing of information in the final stages, and you think you have it nailed down, there is still an ace up the sleeve.<br /><br />This is a very professional film. All the aspects of production are top shelf. The sets, cinematography, sound and music meld together in a near seamless fashion. Something else I liked is that nobody in the cast has drool over Hollywood faces. They all look like real people. And though not all of the Hollywood type aspects in the storytelling are avoided, it is still clever enough and fresh enough to please even the most demanding of fans.<br /><br />Myself being a big fan of the mystery-thriller genre I put this right up there with "Seven", "The Secret in Their Eyes" and "Silence of the Lambs". It's better than skin deep. It dives down to greater depths and should stick to your ribs like a good spaghetti dinner.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="**** A PLEASANT SURPRISE ****"></head><body><p>The Sum of All Fears is the fourth film and in my opinion best film so far based on Tom Clancy's spy thrillers featuring the ever-reluctant hero Jack Ryan, now played by (a much more age appropriate) Ben Affleck.<p>The plot of this movie revolves around a neo-fascist group, led by a nasty Alan Bates, trying to provoke a nuclear war between Russia and America by exploding a nuclear device on American soil (Baltimore, to be precise). It stars Ben Affleck as a younger Ryan, pre-marriage and pre Hunt For Red October, being taken under the wing of fatherly CIA director Morgan Freeman. I know there have been some very mixed reviews for this movie but much to my pleasant surprise I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be totally gripping and an excellent edge of the seat thriller. <p>The Sum of all Fears is directed by Phil Alden Robinson, who previously directed the wonderful Field of Dreams, and he brings a lot more depth, subtlety and humour to both the characters and the plot development than Phillip Noyce previously managed in either of the last two Ryan movies (Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger), not to mention the other clunkers on Noyce's r&eacute;sum&eacute;, including The Saint, Sliver and The Bone Collector (excellent novel, terrible adaptation). In fact it's a wonder this franchise has survived Phillip Noyce and that Noyce still has a career (although apparently his latest movie Rabbit Proof fence is actually very good).  <p>As for the cast, I feel that Affleck is a perfect choice and that he has at last found a decent role in a decent movie. Perhaps his first decent role since Good Will Hunting, which he co-wrote with Matt Damon, and certainly much much better than the dreadful Titanic-alike Pearl Harbour. Morgan Freeman is of course reliably excellent as always and has some of the best lines in the whole movie as CIA boss Bill Cabot but there are also other excellent supporting performances from the likes of Liev Schrieber as a covert CIA operative, James Cromwell (as a belligerent U.S. President), Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Russian President Nemerov and Alan Bates as the chief villain. However I can't say I was totally convinced with Bridget Moynahan as Ryan's girlfriend, Dr Cathy Mueller. Although one thing's for sure, she is very pleasant to look at and there were some excellent shared scenes between her and Affleck. I just didn't find her very convincing in her white coat playing a surgeon.<p>In summary, I cannot think of a mainstream Hollywood thriller that I've enjoyed so much in a long time and many of the people I know that have also seen this film were equally as thrilled. I can honestly say that it was a pleasant surprise to enjoy this so much and that this is definitely one of the best films I've seen all year. Highly recommended! Four and a half stars.</p></body></html>

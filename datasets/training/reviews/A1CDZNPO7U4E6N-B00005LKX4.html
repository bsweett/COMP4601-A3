<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Good. Doesn't compare to the classic &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;"></head><body><p>&quot;Hannibal&quot; was a pretty O.K movie except for the fact that Jodie Foster wasn't in it. As a southern woman, I must say that Julianne Moore had one of the worst southern accents I have ever heard before, and she didn't bring any justice to Clarice Starling. However, I did love the story, and I thought it was a good thriller. It wasn't necessarily what I thought it was going to be. When you say a name like Hannibal Lector you think of cannibal, but in my opinion he hardly did any killing, and those he did kill weren't killed in the fashion that I thought Hannibal Lector had become accustomed to. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was a classic, but I guess you could say that &quot;Hannibal&quot; was a fairly good movie, certainly not one of the best though.</p></body></html>

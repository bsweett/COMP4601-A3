<meta name="summary" content="Best Film Action Drama"></head><body><p>Just watched this on AMC the other day on a small old 27" and after maybe 20 times, STILL I rate this film as phenomenal in script, acting, directing, set design, etc. Typically one can find inconsistencies and other issues after many viewings, but this one stands the test of time. Was surprised I watched in entirety without a single negative comment and that is a rare moment in my film viewing history.  True roller coaster ride, wide-eyed captivating drama based on a true story. Highly recommend and if O'Henry sobers up, anticipate a franchise extension with Part Deux and his painting career, divorce, kids, and life on the left coast!</p></body></html>

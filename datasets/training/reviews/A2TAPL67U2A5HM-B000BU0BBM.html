<meta name="summary" content="The Brothers Grimm"></head><body><p>The Brothers Grimm is a 2005 Adventure film directed by Terry Gilliam (whom has also written the script). Being that Gilliam was with the Monty Python gang the expectations are high. Unfortunately whilst the idea is a brilliant one, i.e., taking the world of the Grimm tales and turning them into a film; the end result is far from astounding and more of mediocre. Matt Damon and Heath Ledger both do what they can to create great characters but the problem is the less then great dialogue. Overall a film that is worthy of a 3 out of 5.</p></body></html>

Unlike those real life characters, Alonzo Harris has no ties with reality,  thank God. This character is a cop who has been in the streets for too long dealing with scum that eventually his mind and morale went crooked. Trust me, we do not want these kind of characters wandering our streets! Denzel nails the part with extreme professionalism which earned him an Academy award for Best Actor.<p>Ethan Hawke, who plays rookie cop Jake Hoyt, is excited and yet very unlucky to be assigned to Harris for a his first day, training day. What Hoyt is about to experience is a day that he will be looking back at not as a day of his training to be a cop, but as a day he chose the moral path he would stick to for the rest of his life. <p>Antoine Fuqua's direction brings the realism of the streets and smoothens the atmosphere for his characters to express themselves freely, especially Washington who seems to steal every scene he's in with the dialogue that he conveys like a pro and its Ethan Hawke who does a wonderful job of staying one step behind Washington making the characters interactions one on one an interesting viewing.<p>The DVD features several bonuses including a behind the scenes segment, an alternate ending and a couple music videos.<p>Recommended<p>A-</p></body></html>

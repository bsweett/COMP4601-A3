<meta name="summary" content="like it or not, he was our president for 8 years...."></head><body><p>For me, this film was a teaching tool to learn more about our former US President, whom I have gone from disliking, to admiring, I've gotten at least to respect and understanding now, because of this film. Josh Brolin does a very nice Bush Jr, and James Cromwell does a nice job as his father, the whole cast does a nice job actually, and director Oliver Stone, though I refuse to sit thru Natural Born Killers, does a good job here, though I'm not sure<br />what he's doing here, but I'm pretty sure it isn't a satire. I'm hoping it's mostly the truth, as to how he went from alchoholic to team player, to 43rd US President.<br />His father-Bush senior, in this film anyway, was always criticizing him into his middle aged years, I had/have a fatherly figure, in the form of my g-pa, so I can understand why he had a hard time loving his dad, although mine was mia half the time.<br />I still don't agree with the 2nd Iraq war, but now I somewhat understand why it had to start, but if they never found WMD but they found Saddam Hussein who is now dead, still looking for Bin Laden, whom at this point, I'm not sure they'll ever find...alive, that is.<br />After he was elected, I was very angry, saying that he stole the election from Gore/Kerry, calling it a fiasco, but now I think I may have been unfairly critical of him. I hope they do a movie on Obama in a few years letting you draw your own conclusions about him, much like this one does, sometimes that works better. However, I'm not sure it's owners material for everyone, regardless of your political views.</p></body></html>

It was kind of annoying at first, and well, any time Allen was on camera, but as soon as Sigourney Weaver and Mr. Rickman joined in, it was kinda fun. Sam rockwell had a great small part too. This is basically a spoof of Star Trek and science fiction films, which normally wouldn't interest me, but I must say, it definitley had its moments.</p></body></html>

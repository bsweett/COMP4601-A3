<meta name="summary" content="[3.5] Well, it does have some fun action"></head><body><p>The majority will agree that this is one of the lesser successful of the Bond films, and I will have to agree with that.  Things begin with an explosive start at the pre-credits scene, but slowly and surely, it all falls apart until the dreaded finale.  Like even the worst of Bond films (which are very few) there are still going to be some highlights, and with Die Another Day, that mostly consists of some fun action scenes.<br /><br />A great story is told here with some good ideas and originality, but execuation is the problem.  While on a mission in North Korea, Bond is actually captured and abandoned by MI6 for well over a year.  Frightened that Bond may have given information about MI6 while under torture, the service exchanges one of the Korean's - "Zao" - for Bond.  Bond is held in a hospital in Hong Kong by M, but escapes and decides to go on a personal vendetta that we don't see too oftenin a Bond film.  Eventually, we learn that both Bond and MI6 are after the same man "Gustav Graves", and decide to work together again.<br /><br />Graves is an interesting villain in that he is not quite himself.  I would explain more but that would give away one of the better parts of the film.  The trouble with Graves is that his character seems to go downhill throughout the film, to the point of wishing to finally see him die.  His henchman "Zao" was pretty decent, and though not nearly the best henchman in a Bond movie, I enjoyed his presence more than Graves, and his facial features were most unique - diamonds embedded in his face from an earlier explosion.  Zao has several small fights with Bond, but its an extremely fun car chase on ice that is the highlight.  The other charcaters in the film, mainly the Bond women, were very uninteresting.  Though Halle Berry has the role of a secret agent herself, I felt she could have done so much better with the part.  One would think Berry was capable of more than the performance she gives.  As for the other girl - Miranda Frost - something about her personality never clicked from the start, though it was interesting to see exactly whose side she was on in the end.<br /><br />Exotic locations seem to have gone the way of the dodo in this film.  Locations include North Korea, Cuba, and Iceland.  However, its obvious that the North Korea in the film is a made up set. The Cuban shots were actually filmed in Spain, and the Iceland scenes were made up as well.<br /><br />There are some great action scenes in the movie, but all heavily relying on digital effects, lossing that classic Bond action feel.  The car chase scene on the ice is excellent, and so is the hovercraft chase before the credits in North Korea.  There is also a fun swordplay scene between Bond and Graves thats fun when it gets out of hand.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan's last film as 007 sadly hit a sour note.  His charcater got a litte more interesting this time around, but its too bad Brosnan couldn't put a little more into it.  While he seemed to have finally gotten comfortable with the role of 007, he has now gotten a little too relaxed.  Oh well.  Casino Royale with Daniel Craig has come to pick up the Brond franchise and put it back on its feet after this.<br /><br />Action - 4<br />Acting - 3.5<br />Charcaters - 3<br />Story - 3.5<br />Overall - 3.5</p></body></html>

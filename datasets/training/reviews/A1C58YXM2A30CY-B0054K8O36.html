<meta name="summary" content="Familiar Story on Stranger Tides!"></head><body><p>[This review is the theatrical release.]<br /><br />With a mix of historical fact, some mythology and lots of suspension of disbelief, I enjoyed watching Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.<br /><br />Themes & Plot:<br /><br />I like how the movie starts out with an imposter Jack Sparrow, rumors of putting a crew together and various secret plans and maps to find Ponce de Leon's fountain of youth.  The problem with the fountain is that you steal another's life and gain their years.  It's not a simple matter of taking a drink.<br /><br />Interesting myth-making here.  The tear from a mermaid, two silver goblets and a victim.  Piece of cake!<br /><br />The character driven story was much more involved than the special effects CGI-fest of the past films.  I was a bit surprised at the rocky Florida coast and lighthouse castle (rocky coasts in Florida??) and enjoyed the pirates Blackbeard and the one-legged pirate played by Ian McShane.  Penelope Cruz as the sexy pirate was also fun to watch - but really, I doubt women at the time were ever permitted onboard these vessels as officers, much less there at all!<br /><br />The life aboard ship was antiseptic as is expected from a Disney film.  The "zombie-fied" slavers whipping the boys into shape, the sexy but deadly mermaids and the various subplots, such as the romance between mermaid and minister - made for a well-paced film.<br /><br />There are a few slow points and that's why a four rather than a five star film.  The acting was well-done, the special effects were good without being overdone, and the discoveries of various creatures and activities was interesting as well as the supernatural.<br /><br />The Spanish explorers were into destroying what they considered pagan or supernatural, which is in conformance with their historical voyages of destruction of the native peoples' cultures in this area.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  More character driven than the others; recaptured for me the pacing and the art of telling a story that the first film had.  Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz make a great couple.  And the in-credits scene opens the door for yet another sequel!<br /><br />Other Pirate Films in the Series:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D8P230">Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy (Seven-Disc Blu-ray)</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kevin Spacey is Amazing"></head><body><p>Kevin Spacey is the co-writer, director, and star of the Bobby Darin bio-pic and hopefully you were able to figure out by my 4-star rating, but I one of the major problems in the film (that almost led me to give it 3 stars) was the fact that there is too many flashback/childhood sequence that half the time you can't tell what's going on in the story at the moment and what's not.<br /><br />This can sometimes be annoying, however the film is interesting and Kevin Spacey is amazing in the role, that it was hard for me not to like the film. I love Kevin Spacey from films like "American Beauty," "K-Pax," and "The Usual Suspects" and I'm not really familar with Bobby Darin. I knew the songs "Beyond the Sea," "Mack the Knife," and "Splish Splash" but that's as far as it went. This movie does give insight into the life of Bobby Darin. The film opens with Darin singing Mack the Knife when he sees a young boy (the younger version of himself) he stops the show and we realize that he's actually filming a movie about his own life. At some point during this scene, a person says "you're too old to play the role." which relates to a lot of people (and critics) feeling about Spacey playing Darin. Anyway, while working on a movie Bobby meets Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth) and a musical scene with Darin singing "Beyond the Sea" evolves which brings to mind classic films from the fifties where people would burst out in song for seemingly no reason. Spacey sounds exactly like Darin and is truly a great singer. I agree with the editors review that says Sandra Dee doesn't hold his attention as much as the little boy does. But I wouldn't say it has "soap opera" twists. You could read a small page of these so called-twists by googling Bobby Darin. This is a bio-pic, not a murder mystery. I think Spacey should have been given a Best Actor, Best Director, or Best Original Score Oscar nomination, because he succeeded greatly at these things. The script isn't quite solid, but is definitley interesting. B-</p></body></html>

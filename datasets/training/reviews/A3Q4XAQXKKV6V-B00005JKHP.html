I hadn't seen this movie for a very long time and didn't remember much of it, just that it seemed very slow. But having seen it recently I can't believe the script. To go through the detail they went through on set design only to shoot almost an identical &quot;TV SHOW SCRIPT&quot; is odd to me. This story is a cross between the &quot;M5 Computer&quot; and the &quot;Nomad Probe&quot; needless to say, it's been done. I wonder why no one mentions it?<p>The cast. The chemistry is off and the additions to the cast are fairly weak. The way the dialogue is written is largely to blame here.<p>The sound. Finely a strong suit. Wow, this is a great s/t, and really sets the stage for further movies and TV shows.<p>The transfer/effects. Ahh, dvds are perfect... right? Not in this case, there are many &quot;glitches and scratchs&quot; on the actual film. When the scratches are not there the movie really shines, however about every 10 minutes or so you seeing a bit of imperfections here and there. This is the best looking film in terms of details. In a way it reminds me of the care that was taken in the 1st season as opposed to the runaway abandonment in the 3rd. The other movies seem more polished and less attention to lighting was taken, to me this movie shows a much more realistic view of the evolution of Star Trek. However, to accomplish this really slows the movie down, so it's not without drawbacks.<p>The ending/extras. Predictable and only fueled to mediocrity by a poor script. Nice to have the commentary, generally informative however it only serves to highlight the lack of extras on any of the other films. Since Voyage Home was the highest grossing movie in the series, why no commentary on that one? The fans deserve it.</p></body></html>

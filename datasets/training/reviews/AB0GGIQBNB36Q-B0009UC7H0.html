No director or screenwriter can make a good movie out of a clive cussler book, like Sahara.  A very good book, with an incredible twist at the end. But Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, and well. Everybody else for that matter, were horribly miscast. Dirk Pitt is not a treasure hunter, and in the book he didn't believe that a civil war ironclad had ended up in the sahara. Rudy Gunn is a nerd, but not to this extent. Yeves massarde are portrayed horribly as well, I was looking forward to the escape from the boat, but this movie totally, and I mean totally changes the plot from the book. The only common denominator is the ironclad, and that's it. I do own this movie, and every now and then I get it out and watch it. And I'm just amazed how you can take an awsome book, and totally change it, there's no tabeza jail moment where Giordino kills the evil lady. They would have been better to not put Clive Cussler's name on this.</p></body></html>

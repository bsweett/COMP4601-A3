<meta name="summary" content="SODERBERGH TRIUMPHS"></head><body><p>Unfortunately for this film, the ads that came out to promote it told too much of the story and gave away a lot of its really outstanding humour. This film actually was great. Soderbergh's direction was excellent and perhaps unexpected. Julia Roberts turns in a powerhouse performance as Erin Brockovich who uses her quick wit, perseverance and aggression to fuel her drive not only to wheedle her way into a job for which she is not at once qualified but uses it even more convincingly when she investigates the case for which she is well known and around which this script is built. A compelling story of a regular person who uses what skills and assets she does have to discover a cover-up and to get compensation for those whose lives were adversely affected or altogether destroyed by the information covered up. The cast was great, and Roberts deserves accolades for this performance. It was great to see the chameleonic Aaron Eckhart here also as Brockovich's boyfriend.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not what I expected..."></head><body><p>I learned long ago to take other folks' opinion with a grain of salt and this movie would be a prime example.  A co-worker told me that this movie was a comedy...there was nothing comedic about this movie after the first 20 minutes. This was a solid, realistic look at how a soldier goes into the military.  It shows how they are broken down and built back up, the mind games the superiors play to get them to follow their commands, the manipulation involved in 9/11, the REAL point of the war (read: gas), how the soldiers had to survive in the desert, and how their relationships were tested in the process.  The branding scenes were a little too much for my eyes, but I thought this was an excellent movie.  The main character in this movie did a great job at playing a decent guy who just needed to learn how the military REALLY works and Jamie Foxx did a great job too.  This was a really, really good movie.  A couple of slow scenes happened during the bombing, but I loved the underlying meaning. Unfortunately, I think it will go over a lot of peoples' head (like the person who told me the movie was a comedy).</p></body></html>

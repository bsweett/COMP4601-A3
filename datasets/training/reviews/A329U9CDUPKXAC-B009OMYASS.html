<meta name="summary" content="About 20min were really good"></head><body><p>I was disappointed by this film. It starts out with three sex crazed, homophobic bigots, who you can't wait to see die. And that seems to go on for hours. Then you get to the horror stuff which was really excellent. The whole look of the torture chamber was perfect and the torturers were very creepy.<br /><br />After that...it turns into a comedy and I don't know why. Going more for laughs than screams. Once the hero frees himself he has little problem escaping and knocking off the villains one by one. And once the kids were stomping on the guy's dead skull I was really rolling my eyes. It goes from creepy horror to total corn ball.</p></body></html>

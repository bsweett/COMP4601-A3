<meta name="summary" content="It's all about choices"></head><body><p>Two years after his conversion to Spiderman, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) seems to finally have his life under control.  His confidence in his powers has returned, and New York City is awash in SpiderMania; he's acing his college courses, and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), whom he has loved since grade school, finally recognizes and returns his love.  But there are flies in the ointment still.  His lifelong friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), who blames Spidey for his father's death, now knows that Spidey and Peter are one and the same, and has also discovered that the senior Osborn was the Green Goblin; with the Goblin's mask and sky-sled he's about to unveil himself as the New Goblin.  Peter is confronted with an ambitious rival photographer (Topher Grace) for J. Jonah Jameson's (J. K. Simmons) Daily Bugle.  And the police discover that his Uncle Ben was not killed by the con they had thought responsible, but by another, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who has recently escaped from prison and been transformed to a new super-villain, the Sandman.  On top of all this, a small meteoroid that lands unnoticed near the Lover's Lane where Peter and MJ are enjoying a quiet moment together proves to have a hitchhiker--a symbiotic alien lifeform that takes possession of Peter and magnifies all his less attractive qualities.  Besides the usual wonderful SFX (including a splendid sequence featuring an out-of-control crane crashing into a skyscraper) and Marvel angst, this concluding (so far) film in the Spidey franchise has as its theme the importance of making choices.  Will bad reviews of one of her parts push MJ into abandoning her dreams of Broadway success?  Will Peter let the symbiote continue to control him even after he knows what it is and sees what it's making him do?  Will he seek revenge against Marko as he did against Ben's supposed murderer?  Will Harry Osborn agree to help him rescue MJ from the Sandman, or be willing to sacrifice even the girl he once loved for the sake of his revenge?  Even Marko shows an unexpected side of his nature in a climactic scene between himself and Spidey.  This may well be the best title in the trilogy.</p></body></html>

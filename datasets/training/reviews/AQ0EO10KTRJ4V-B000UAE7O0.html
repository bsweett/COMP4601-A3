<meta name="summary" content="Good for what it was... would have preferred a serious film"></head><body><p>PLANET TERROR was good for what it was..... namely a zombie spoof film that paid homage to Drive-In films of the 1970s.<br />Of course it was over the top and cheesy.<br /><br />The budget, special effects, and other film making aspects of the film were quite good which made me think to myself....... "Wow just imagine how good they could have made this film if they had used all these resources to make a serious horror/action film..... man they even had Savini to help them out"<br /><br />So in summary....... it was good for what it was, but I would have enjoyed it more if they used all those resources to make a serious version of the same basic screenplay idea.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WRY, RIVETING ACCOUNT OF TEEN ANOMIE"></head><body><p>Never heard about this one, but ended up glued right through to its end. Great find! A dark comedy about a teenager's frustration with setting out on the road to self-discovery and coming to a dead end.<br /><br />The dialogue is nimble, the music apt, and the screenplay a refreshing change from the pat assembly-line teenybop flicks cranked out several times a year by Hollywood. The plot is peripheral, it's the characters and a fluid narrative that take center-stage.<br /><br />As delightfully droll but cynical 17 year-olds facing the first challenges of adulthood -- leaving home, getting a job, finding a love life -- the two female protagonists do a fabulous job of coming across as outsiders among their peers never quite trying to "fit in".<br /><br />In what begins as a harmless goof, one of them finds herself drawn to schleppy forty-something Seymour (Buscemi), a regular Joe and collector of 78rpm records. You know Buscemi from character roles in a bunch of popular movies, including Reservoir Dogs; all pent-up cynicism and inherent geekiness, he couldn't be more perfect in this role.<br /><br />Thrown in are other interesting caricatures of some pretty credible small town characters, notably an art teacher who got more inane with every highfalutin bit of art she expounded on high school kids.<br /><br />Thankfully, the movie resists the temptation of convenient closures so some may take issue with how it all turns out for the teenage girl and the middle age geek. But it feels more real this way.<br /><br />What a marvellously done film. Rent it pronto, even the credits are worth it.</p></body></html>

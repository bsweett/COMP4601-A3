<meta name="summary" content="It's a good film and at times great but at times you want more"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this film but it's not as good as everyone was saying it was. The film is good and at times the film is great but at times you want more with the film. The film is about Johnny Cash and his love for June Carter but that's about it. I found there could of been more of a story then there was. the acting is good from Joaquin Phoenix who doserves his oscar nod and he might win,  Reese Witherspoon shines (she shines in everything) and she might win an oscar too (I found soem of the other actress in the catoagory better then her). Overall the film is good and I recomand it you will be mesmerized at times through the film.</p></body></html>

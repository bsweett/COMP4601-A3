<meta name="summary" content="Something Missing"></head><body><p>Interesting enough, two of the critically acclaimed films that have come out this Christmas season center around a confused child's dastardly influence on his/her small environment--in a locale that is beleaguered by war.  While in "The Kite Runner," twelve year old aspiring storyteller Amir deliberately lies to assuage his guilt regarding his reaction to a tragedy that befalls his best friend in pre-Soviet invaded Afghanastan, thirteen-year-old budding writer, Briony of director Joe Wright's Atonement completely misinterprets a flirtation she witnesses between her older sister--the willowy Cecilia (Keira Knightly) and the Cambridge educated son of the housekeeper, Robbie (James McAvoy) in pre WWII Britain and unthinkingly sets off a series of events that result in a crime that ruins all three lives.  Both of these creatively imaginative children in their search for attention destroy their likelihood for a healthy existence; only through the act of repentance does either of them get the opportunity to make the necessary amends.  Luckily Amir's second chance comes in the form of an actual person that he proactively influences.<br /><br />In Briony's case, the issues are further complicated by outside stimuli that put her eventual accountability in the realm if the moot point.  Only at the end of the film does director Wright and screenwriter Christopher Hampton brilliantly detail for us in a scene played to perfection by the incomparable Vanessa Redgrave as the 2000 Briony, the utterly abysmal chain of events that she had no power to control.  Even the literary force of her imagination can wield little strength in the face of such devastating reality.  Her happy ending fades to a mere contrivance when compared to Amir's flesh and blood resolution.<br /><br />From the get-go we are mesmerized by the sound of an old-fashioned typewriter's keys hammering their petulantly persistent staccato rhythm, reminding us that we are en masse to hear a story unfold--we do not know who is telling the story or if we are about to witness a story within a story--we know only that the story continues from an idyllic 1935 peek at privileged manor life to the hospital wards of war-torn London and evacuation of Dunkirk to a modern day taping of an interview in a television studio.  Wherever we hear that keyboard tapping we follow like bloodhounds on a scent to whatever end  the story will eventually bring us.<br /><br />The startling and contrasting cinematography for "Atonement" either glows with the warmth of summer or cremates the sky and surroundings with the actual ashes of war.  The actors filter in and out like silent film stars--the first few dramatic minutes are marked by non-verbal glimmers of each personality:  Briony marches from one wood-paneled hallway to a raft of flower-sprigged bedrooms.  She parades to the music of the typewriter key as the outraged child and again as the young haunted nurse patrolling the hospital ward.  Siren Cecilia moves her angular body engulfed in diaphanous green silk or creamily lapeled dressing gowns with the assuredness of Bette Davis.  Even in the starched uniform of a hospital sister she appears in charge and in affected need of a cigarette holder.  Poor but sensual blue-eyed Robbie floats through the estate's fields like the appreciative optimistic beneficiary he is and later blank-eyed like a desanguinated ghost, he flits through the macabre carnival-like atmosphere of chaotic Dunkirk beach like a lost child.  Regardless of the film's halcyon-day beauty and stark ugliness, the production seems at times to lack cohesiveness. As much as I like actor McAvoy, his rambling about in war-torn France while suggesting his character's diverted life course, seemed wasted as if the filmmakers too were distracted by their own craft rather than connect us more intricately to the story and sobering themes snowballing around us.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Like many period pieces "Atonement" fascinates by depicting a sliver of life from a time long gone.  As an adaptation of a finalist for the Booker Prize, it is difficult to convert the language and mood of the book to the screen.  Director Wright nearly gets it right in the first half, depicting a misunderstood act of carnal courtship as a topnotch episode of the Masterpiece Theatre genre.  His camera work impresses; the manner in which he repeats key events from the perspective of the child and the adults spectacularly superimposes that vantage point and sensibility in the mind's eye of the viewer. Nonetheless, he fails later on with too much ado about war, falling prey to too much costuming and epic scenes that detract from the original McEwan theme of the imagined atoning for life.  Particularly enjoy actor Jame McAvoy whose splendid sensitivity and versatility is showcased in almost every scene he is in.  Recommended with this caveat.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing and Gross, with Severe Lapses in Taste"></head><body><p>I compared the original "Alien Vs. Predator" with the later films in the Universal "Golden Age" horror cycle. Once long-standing franchises like Frankenstein, Dracula and the Wolf Man began to fade in their appeal at the box-office, producers decided to drum up business by combining those classic monsters in silly, entertaining B-grade brawlers like "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man," "House of Dracula" and "House of Frankenstein." Those films weren't made with the same production attributes as their more esteemed predecessors, yet were quite endearing in their own right for the action and no-brain fun that they offered.<br /><br />While one can argue that the "Alien" and "Predator" franchises had not been exhausted to the degree that the Universal Monsters had (the two-film "Predator" series in particular), Fox nevertheless decided to make their own modern-day "monsterfest" with the first "Alien Vs. Predator." The 2004 film carried a more kid-friendly PG-13 rating and raked in big bucks, totaling $80 million domestically and even more overseas as it mixed the Dan O'Bannon-Ronald Shusett created "Alien" franchise with Jim and John Thomas' lizard-like intergalactic hunter.<br /><br />It made sense that a sequel would follow, but the big surprise was how ALIENS VS. PREDATOR: REQUIEM would make its predecessor look like a cinematic masterpiece by comparison.<br /><br />Bloodier and more graphic with its "R" rating (which many believe lead to the film failing to come close to its predecessor's box-office in-take), yet amateurishly written, flatly acted and even tasteless in sections, this nightmarish mess feels like a bad Sci-Fi Channel original movie masquerading as a major-studio theatrical release.<br /><br />Shane Salerno's script picks up literally right where the original left off, with an alien/predator hybrid popping out of the entrails of the slain Predator who finished off the Alien Queen at the end of its predecessor. No sooner does the ship crash back on Earth -- this time near a Colorado mountain town -- than the "PredAlien" runs amok, laying alien eggs and causing trouble for its human populace, including a pizza delivery man (Johnny Lewis) beaten up by his would-be girlfriend's beau, his older brother (Steven Pasquale), and a military vet (Reiko Aylesworth) recently welcomed home by her husband and young daughter. Meanwhile, another Predator is dispatched to take down the PredAlien and anything else that stands in its way.<br /><br />The "Brothers Strause" made their feature debut with "AVP2," playing up the gore and special effects which the first "AVP" admittedly took its time unveiling. Seeing that there's no longer any surprise to the appearance of these creatures, that's perfectly understandable, but as a result there's no tension, shocks or scares of any real kind here either. What's arguably even worse is Salerno's screenplay, a pedestrian assembly of scenes ("aliens in the swimming pool," "aliens in the diner," "predator in the graveyard," and on and on) linked by some of the least appealing and poorly developed characters you'll ever see in a film of this kind. The no-name cast lacks charm, charisma and any kind of empathy, with former "24" star Aylesworth (the only recognizable face) completely wasted in what could have been a Ripley-like female lead.<br /><br />Indeed, the picture is only successful in cultivating the occasional, unintentional laugh, most of which involve the Predator who's trying to clean up the mess. It figures that, of all the Predators in the galaxy, they send the one who couldn't even use a Wii remote effectively, with a particularly hilarious moment ensuing when the Predator can't even hit one little alien with his rocket launcher -- causing instead an explosion at the power facility that leads to a community-wide blackout. While it might have been even funnier if a studio audience laugh track had been applied to the sequence, it's still amusing as played.<br /><br />"Requiem," then, rarely delivers the goods that one would've anticipated from the first-ever arrival of Aliens in a suburban Earth setting, and what's more, manages to be tasteless and gross when the creatures hit a maternity ward late in the film. By that point it's clear how desperate the filmmakers had become, and how understandable it might be for viewers to hit the eject button on their remotes.<br /><br />Fox's 2-disc DVD and Blu-Ray disc offer the movie's 94-minute R-rated theatrical cut as well as a 102-minute Unrated version. As is usual with these "Unrated" cuts, almost none of the added footage is gore-related, instead adding some development to the characters, though some of the maternity ward sequence is even more graphic and thus to be avoided in the extended version.<br /><br />Both sets are packed with mostly-promotional flavored extras, including a pair of commentaries (one by creature experts Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr., plus the Brothers Strause and producer John Davis on an alternate track), a whole group of featurettes, trailers, and a bonus second disc sporting an official "downloadable" digital copy for portable media players.<br /><br />Visually, the Blu-Ray disc offers a splendid AVC-encoded transfer with a typically active DTS Master Audio digital track, while Fox's standard DVD includes a superb 16:9 (2.35) transfer with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound.</p></body></html>

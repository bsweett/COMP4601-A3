<meta name="summary" content="Mozart's music"></head><body><p>This review refers to the shorter 153 minute version of the film, although I have also seen quite a few of the extras on the two disc special edition as well.<br /><br />This is a truly epic film based on Peter Shaeffers's play, which tells the story of Mozart from the point of view of the aged Court Composer Salieri, looking back. Salieri is played by F Murray Abraham, who undoubtably steals the acting honours, if only because his performance is always entirely believeable, if not neccessarily any more factual. Tom Hulse gives a fine performance as Mozart, but I always felt that there was more artistic licence in his performance than in Abrahams.<br /><br />The music is superbly performed and the operatic settings deserve special mention. Certainly this film gives you every opportunity to appreciate the extraordinary talent that Mozart was blessed with. Whether the play the film is based on is in any way factual is unknown to me but this is an irrelevance. The music and performances are fact and that is enough for me.</p></body></html>

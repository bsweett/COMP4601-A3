<meta name="summary" content="THE FORGOTTEN WAR?"></head><body><p>Oh, yes, I know it is Korea, a far more brutal war than Vietnam, in terms of casualties per unit of time, that is known as the forgotten war, but I have a feeling that the American Revolution is fading in peoples minds because it is no longer central to early school curricula. So be it. At any rate, while not exactly an historically accurate film, not much more than OK as a movie experience, still The Patriot is a reminder of just what we had to do to create a nation for ourselves. When all is said and done, it was not Washington's way with words, oratory, that won the war, it was men being killed and shockingly wounded, for seven years, that did it.<br />The film is best in its action scenes, OK on delineating the home front. Gibson does a satisfactory job and the rest of the cast does what they are allowed to do.<br />And, yes, the accepted military technique in an era when rifles needed some time to reload, was to achieve greatest impact from massed weapons and cannon facing the enemy on the field. Real tough on a man who had to stand up  as a beautiful target to do his job. The film would have been improved by prudent reduction in length,  but, I suppose, it was intended to be EPIC.</p></body></html>

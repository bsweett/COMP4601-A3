The plot is extremely simple.  3 guys go to Europe to smoke pot, have indiscriminate sex, smoke more pot, drink, and have more sex.  They go to Slovenia, where they get abducted by some locals who runs a business (for lack of a better term) where they entertain wealthy clients by allowing them to torture and kill people.  Do places like this really exist?  Probably, but it's best not to think about those things.  Is this film any good?  Roth builds up a nice sense of dread when you finally get to the torture palace, but that's it.  The film has a great premise, but the execution of it is pedestrian.  The 3 protagonists aren't as boorish as some people have suggested, but you don't really get to know them too well.  They're never developed as real people, just stock movie characters.  This film doesn't have any substance or depth to it at all.  And what's more the film has absolutely no sense of humour.  I like horror films infused with a dark, cynical humour, like the films of Romero, especially Dawn of the Dead and The Crazies.  This could have easily been one of those.  There are too many coincidences, and some very unbelievable scenes (the one where one of the protagonists gives a bunch of vagabond children candy to kill some of the torture guys is so ridiculous).  Roth is trying to emulate Takashi Miike (who has a cameo here), but he doesn't have any of Miike's sense of depth, substance, and sadness (a lot of people miss those things in Miike's films).  Miike is a real artist, as opposed to Roth, who just wants to show a lot of gore and T & A.  I have seen worse gore in other films.  There are other films out there that are far superior to this.  Start with anything from Miike's catalog.</p></body></html>

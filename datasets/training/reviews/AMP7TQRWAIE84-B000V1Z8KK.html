<meta name="summary" content="I didn't know there was a movie that could suck even worse than Batman Begins. This one takes the cake though!!!"></head><body><p>The plot was boring, the characters were stale and the dialogue was nothing spectacular. It even had me snoring before the end. I had to pop it back in to watch this disaster piece from the beginning.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg was hot as usual, but next time he should read the script before jumping into a movie such as this one!<br /><br />Not recommended and should be avoided!<br /><br />Rent something more exciting and relate-able, Perfect Stranger for the former and American Beauty for the latter.<br /><br /> 2 stars.</p></body></html>

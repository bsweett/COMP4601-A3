As it turns out though, all is not as bad as it seems...<br />Owen Wilson (!!!), Paul Newman, Tom Hanks, Michael Keaton, John Goodman, Tim Allen, Jay Leno, Billy Crystal, Cheech Marin and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all EXCELLENT!<br />In short, Cars is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with the Shrek and Ice Age movies, Madagascar, Hoodwinked, Antz and Monsters Inc.</p></body></html>

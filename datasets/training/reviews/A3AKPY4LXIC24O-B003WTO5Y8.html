While that distinction rightfully belonged to The Exorcist us Horror fans take what we can get.  Certainly the Horror genre didn't need (and still doesn't) an award to validate its importance to film, but an honor is an honor so I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Even without all the accolades, The Silence of the Lambs would be revered and considered a classic example of filmmaking.  There is nothing more disconcerting, yet fascinating to the American public than the act of murder.  The fascination is compounded exponentially when murder is committed in quantity.  Add the seeming randomness of serial slayings, the understanding that anybody could be next, and the result is fanaticism.  That's right, Americans are fans of murder.  The bloodier the better, as long as it's far away and happening to someone else.<br /><br />Many serial killers have achieved celebrity status.  Some have become legend, both living and dead.  Hannibal Lecter, although a fictional construct, ranks among them.  Anthony Hopkins unsettling and convincing portrayal of the cannibal doctor is perhaps one of the most talked about film perfomances of all time.  The character of Lecter has since joined the American Lexicon of Boogeymen, usually a realm reserved for supernatural monsters.  The plausibility of Lecter makes him all the more frightening, his deviance coupled with his uncanny intelligence plays upon our fears of strangers, of being eaten, and the ultimate terror of being outsmarted.<br /><br />Somehow Hollywood recognized a superior monster story and awarded it accordingly.  The novel by Thomas Harris is so closely adhered to in script as to almost be one in the same.  In essence watching the film was like watching the book.  When so often the saying that the book is better than the movie unfortunately (but logically) rings true, finding a film that compliments and accentuates the source material is like stumbling upon cinematic gold.<br /><br />The Silence of the Lambs captured the imagination and attention of American moviegoers like few Horror films have.  Perhaps this is due in part to the fact that most didn't realize they were watching a Horror film to begin with.  I'm sure Chianti sales skyrocketed, perhaps even sales of fava beans.  One thing is for certain, people began to ask what exactly was in the entree at dinner parties, praying the answer wasn't Bob or Lisa.</p></body></html>

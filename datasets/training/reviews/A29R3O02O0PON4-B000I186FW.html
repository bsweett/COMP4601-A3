So many people, including myself, viewed this movie as Left-wing propaganda in Great Britain projected onto the political climate in the US.  In fact, I hated the film, as it portrayed the terrorist as the good guy, or maybe in this case, the anti-hero.  BUT, as I rewatch this movie in 2009 with now ~9 months of the Obama Adminstration in charge of America, I see this "fascist" portrayal of the UK as more of a reflection of the current Obama Administration.  YES...I said it.  The Obama Administration.<br /><br />As we see in the movie, V's overall motive and theme is "People should not fear their government, the government should fear its people."  Sure, the Hitler-like and militaristic methods of the UK government in this film are a bit "right-wingish" imagery (which I'd argue is incorrect on the fact that Nationalized Socialism is anything but "right-wing"), BUT that aside, the policies of this UK government, like the stiffling of free speech, especially the comedic bit mocking the chancellor (oh, where have we heard that title before?  1936 Germany perhaps?) is exactly like what the Obama Adminstration is doing these days.  One example being telling a health insurance company to cease and desist their advertising campaign regarding the possible cut to Medicare.  Umm, First Amendment rights violation right there.  I don't care if the ad is correct or not, they have a right say it.<br /><br />And in the end of the film where we see a "mob" of people dressed in V's cape and mask ascend to the Parlimentary building to watch it blow up.  This is remanescant of the 9.12 March on Washington.</p></body></html>

This sequel could have been a disaster in the making. The Thailand angle could have broke the film.  The difference were the performances of Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant.  They give plausable performances and this film probably would have failed with someone else.  Though not as great as the original, it's still fun!</p></body></html>

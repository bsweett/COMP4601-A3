<meta name="summary" content="Typical Taymor; a Fresh take on the 60's"></head><body><p>To understand this odd (but compelling) film, perhaps you had to be around during the 60's (which I was). The confusion and frustration of that period is so very well conveyed. How better to do that than to bring to life the immortal words & music of the Beatles?! Very fine and original idea. Also, one must understand the gritty, down-to-earth vision of the wonderful Julie Taymor. I've admired her since "Titus", a most profound take on Shakespeare. I was fascinated by "Across the Universe" for many reasons. Her clever use of color may be matched only by the vision of Zhang Yimou's films. Assembing a perfect cast, led by Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood, and supported reliably by Joe Anderson & Dana Fuchs, it couldn't have been better. Indeed, the entire cast was brilliant, with bit parts performed by Bono, Eddie Izzard, Selma Hayek, to name a few. Fresh material is a concept Hollywood has seemed to put on the back burner. Luckily, there are still visionaries like Julie Taymor who can connect with audiences, new and old, to bring fresh air to the often stale and conventional style used by most auteurs. The 2-disc DVD is excellent, with a glorious widescreen version of the film on disc 1 and loads of wonderful and interesting extras on disc 2. Ms. Taymor's vision is well presented.</p></body></html>

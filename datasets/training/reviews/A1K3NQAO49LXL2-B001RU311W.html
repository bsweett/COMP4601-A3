Judd Hirsch is in it too, getting away from his Speed Racer thing and a bit closer to his Dogtown thing. Josh Brolin is fantastic as Harvey Milk's assassin Dan White. It was pretty trippy finding out about the weird world of Anita Bryant and her goofy anti-gay campaigners, but this is what the hate of the 60s and 70s was all about. Great zeitgeist.</p></body></html>

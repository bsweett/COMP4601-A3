<meta name="summary" content="Spider-Man III, the best Spidey yet...... or not."></head><body><p>Based on when I saw it in theaters in May.<br /><br />"Spider-Man III" turned out to be a bigger disappointment than I thought it would be and I had somewhat high hopes for it, especially after "Spider-Man II" let me down a bit, wait make that a lot.<br /><br />I'll try not to break down a huge synopsis of the film, but it picks up where II left off, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is trying to balance life as Spidey, his job and his relationship with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). Of course his friend Harry Osborne (James Franco) is still mad at him for killing his dad and a good action/fight sequence follows where Harry dons the new Goblin gear and attacks Peter when he's just in his regular clothes. Some good, no great special effects and sprinkled throughout the fight and Harry ends up bumping his head and loses his short term memory for a while, which is prolonged longer than it should've been in this overly long film.<br /><br />There's also an escaped convict (Thomas Hayden Church) who gets turned into a pile of sand that can take human form, sort of like Imhotep in "The Mummy", but this time the effects and the character, though somewhat cool seem unnecessary and no more than filler.<br /><br />There's also an alien symbiote that bonds with Peter and makes his suit a cool looking black, amplifies his power, brings out his aggressive side towards his enemies and others and makes him act like a fool around women.<br /><br />Obviously, like in the comics and cartoons, the symbiote will attach itself to Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) and become the ultra cool villain Venom and here in lies the biggest problem with the movie. By the time the symbiote dettachs itself from Peter and attachs to Brock to become Venom, the film has lost quite a bit of steam, though Venom looks cool, he's not in the film nearly enough, which was a big minus, but unfortunately I expected that to happen.<br /><br />There are some neat sequences in the movie, the aforementioned Goblin/Peter fight, a couple of the Sandman fights and the scenes with Venom, but too much of the movie is sappy and bogged down with trying to add sympathy, when it should be having a little more fun.<br /><br />One of the film's biggest problems, besides Venom's lack of screen time, is the fact that too many scenes throughout the movie feel like individual scenes and don't really have a lot of flow to them, which really detracts from what could've been a great, fun movie.<br /><br />It's still a fun movie for the most part, there's good humor (not the iced-dairy product) in some of the scenes, like almost any line or reaction by J.K. Simmons who plays Jameson, loved when he walked in on his secretary and Peter flirting and he says "Ms. Yates, that's not the position I hired you for". I also enjoyed Bruce Campbell's appearance as the Matre'd at a French Restaurant, very funny stuff, "I am French".<br /><br />Too bad there wasn't more to the movie besides the visual effects and humor, which should be more than you need for most summer movies, but this one felt like it needed more.<br /><br />The acting wasn't too bad, actually Church did a great job creating emotion for the Sandman character, but again it started to feel sappy after a while, same goes for Harry as the Goblin. A lot of the acting was not that good either and again the scenes seemed separate from each other, no real flow.<br /><br />After watching the movie twice, once with my two best friends and others at a midnight show, which was fun for the crowd reactions and again a week or so later with my girlfriend, I summed up the movie with the following assessment "It felt too long, but rushed at the same time", a lethal (and not the good kind of lethal) combination.<br /><br />Not a bad movie, but no where near as good as the first and it doesn't give me as much hope as I had before of another three or possible four sequels still to come, if the rumors are true.</p></body></html>

Romero's follow is probably one of the 10 best Horror movies of the 1970's.  However, while other (such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre) trys to grab you by pushing the  limits with shock, Georgie boy goes the other way by getting you to think  just a touch.<p>This movie is not really a sequel to Night of the Living  Dead (one of the top 10 of the 1960's), but can be seen as related (set 1~2  years after).  Man is in dire danger, as the dead have come back to life.  Civilization is breaking down and choas is helping the Zombie's win.  Four  survivors take off in a helicopter and are forced to land on the roof of a  shopping mall, surrounded by Zombies.  <p>The movie paints broad strokes,  the characters are just not really developed enough.  The movie is about  materialism and greed, and how our current society is based more on  emptiness (using the shopping mall as a mecca as an example) rather than  any sound foundation.  <p>The DVD is bare, with a few features (the  funniest being an advertisement for the mall, where the movie was shot).  There is no audio commentary and the soundtrack was in Mono.  However, if  you like horror movies to be alittle less about T&amp;A and Gore, try out  the Dawn of the Dead.....Before there is no more room in hell....Rating: B.</p></body></html>

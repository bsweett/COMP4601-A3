<meta name="summary" content="Possibly one of the worst movie I've seen this year."></head><body><p>I've enjoyed the first three Indiana Jones.  Sure some fans feel the second was a bit weak, others feel the third was the weaker.  And everyone felt that the first one was a classic. But for sure most everyone will agree that this fourth installment is awful - although the opening 5 minutes seemed promising.<br /><br />Clearly this movie has the paws of George Lucas all over it, in an effort to establish a franchise with the Indiana Jones' son taking over and before it becomes Indiana Jones and the search for Geritol.<br /><br />Also another sign of George Lucas's interference is in the indiscriminate overuse of special effects.  I guess his effects company, Industrial Light and Magic needed some more work.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with Harrison Ford et al. riding off into the sunset is a fitting end to the series.  Definately won't be buying this episode to "complete" my set.<br /><br />This movie is utter  cash grabbing garbage.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lame"></head><body><p>I wish someone had warned me -- as I'm about to warn you -- just how lame this movie is.  A low-key, though stylish, story about a mismatched couple whose relationship implodes, this movie finds a tenuous comedic premise in the idea that neither of the ex-lovers is willing to move out of their jointly-owned condominium, and thus are present to torture each other day after day.  She brings home cute guys to make him jealous, he retaliates by throwing sleazy strip-poker parties, and so on.<br /><br />There are a lot of factors that make this such a lame movie.  In terms of the overall structure, the decision to go straight at the beginning of the movie into the Big Fight that ends their relationship sinks this story right from the start.  We never see them as a happy couple, and never understand why they were attracted to each other, why they were pulled apart, etc.  In short, there's no character development, and no buy-in from the audience -- we just don't care about either of them.  That's a big drawback.  Also, there's no real chemistry between Anniston and Vaughan, and meanwhile the script and pacing are both rather slack... Nothing really clicks here -- the story, the acting, the direction, all blah.<br /><br />That being said, it wasn't until the very end of the movie that I realized that what the directors were aiming for was a Woody Allen-style character study, a Serious Film.  The first inkling comes when Vaughan delivers his big, serious, take-me-back monologue (which was painful to watch; he was woefully miscast) and the clincher comes in the final scene, where the two ex-lovers meet a year later and have an awkward, um-hi-how-are-you conversation, ala Woody and/or Robert Altman.  In the context of the lifeless film that precedes it, the scene is a dramatic flop (although both actors do reasonably well in the scene itself...) OHHHHHHHH... so THAT'S what they were aiming for!  I get it.  Too bad it didn't work.<br /><br />Anyway, the short version is: skip this film.  It's a waste of time.<br /><br />Nice set design, though, and strong cinematography.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Planet of the Apes?"></head><body><p>Tim Burton's "re-imagining" of the classic 1968 original is big on spectacle but short on story. Starting out like traditional sci fi film (albeit with Mark Wahlberg- what's he doing here?), Planet of the Apes is a very different plot from the first one, and one with lots of spectacle and action, but not so much substance.<p>The plot of the film is very action-orientated and made me want for more background story. Sure, the action set pieces are great, but to have more on how the rouge humans came to the planet ruled by apes would have been appreciated. But like many action films recently the action and SFX make up for the usual lack of a meaty story (or script for that matter).<p>However, Burton's visionary flair does not disappoint, in that sense the film is fantastic, as is Tim Roth as General Thade, leader of the army of apes, and the imposing Michael Clarke Duncan as one of the commanders of the army. The only stink of this movie actually, is the aforementioned Mark Wahlberg, who threatens to redefine the term "wooden".<p>After some huge battle scenes we go to the legendary ending, which understandably confused viewers. Where the original's ending was great, this one is a real thinker, and when it was released, opinions of its climax flew over the net as fast as naked Brittneys.<p>The DVD is great though, and makes for some awesome entertainment with great visuals. If only they had spent as much money on getting the story right as they had on the special effects and this would be a great movie, instead of just a good one.</p></body></html>

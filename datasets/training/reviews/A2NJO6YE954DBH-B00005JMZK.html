Go find that"></head><body><p>The people who put together "Alien vs. Predator" learned absolutely nothing from Mel Gibson's "The Last Temptation of Christ."  One thing they should have learned is that you can have a successful American movie in which nobody speaks English.  This movie should have been set on a planet far, far away, but writer-director Paul W. S. Anderson sets it on Earth so that a bunch of characters who can speak English get to explain what is going on before they are killed by one side or the other.  There is some irony here because the opening credits are translated from the language of the Predators into English, but the key thing is the more these Happy Meals with legs explain the harder it is to make what is happening in this film make sense in terms of the "Aliens" and "Predator" series.<br /><br />That is because not only does Anderson set this movie on Earth, he sets it in October of this year.  The basic premise is that a satellite belonging to super rich guy Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) discovers a pyramid 2000 feet beneath the ice on an island in Antarctica.  So in the grand tradition of "Jurassic Park" (Anderson rips off a lot of familiar movies in cobbling together this story) he hires some experts to rush down and get there before anybody else.  Of course, the race is already lost but Weyland will not know that until it is way too late.<br /><br />Of those who are to probably die the three bodies that stand out are Alexa Woods (Sanna Lathan), the guide who knows about traveling on icy-snowy terrain, Sebastian de Rosa (Raoul Bova), the archeologists who apparently knows about all of the pyramids on Earth and the languages of those who built them from Mexico to Egypt to Cambodia, and Graeme Miller (Ewen Bremner), a mechanical engineer with a Scottish accent.  "Lex" is the sole voice of reason in the endeavor, Sebastian provides the exposition, and Graeme gets to be scared to his own shadow and worry about his two laddies back home.  Lex also has the advantage of being female as well as being the only sane one in the group, so you have to like her chances.<br /><br />While the ease with which Sebastian explains the meaning of everything in the underground pyramid is bothersome enough (the predators are kind enough to use Earth languages and an Earth calendar in the pyramid), the entire back story of how Predators come to be hunting Aliens is even worse.  I do not think having your audience trying to figure out how what you are doing fits into the continuity of the first movie in each series, let alone each series in its entirety, is a good thing.  I also bet I am not the only one who will notice the strong comparisons between this movie and a video game, which is not surprising given Anderson's experience with "Resident Evil."<br /><br />Another major problem is that everything on that Antarctic island or down at the pyrmaid happens in the dark (despite the fact that October in the southern hemisphere would "summer" and not the long winter), so that it is hard to tell what is going on or where it is happening.  This would be another lesson missed from Mel Gibson's film, which went to the other extreme in letting you see everything that was happening.  But "AvP" is like all the rest of this generation of specific effects movies where scenes are shot in the dark and constant cutting is used to give you a vague sense of the fight.  There is nothing comparable to the memorable encounters between Sigourney and the Queen in "Aliens" or Swarzenegger and the original "Predator."  They set the bar and this film faces some mandatory deductions.<br /><br />Fortunately the fight at the end of the film is the best of the bunch in terms of being able to see what is going on so that the film does try to end on a relative high note.  You will probably guess how things will play out in the end and you might even be willing to go along with the film's end game.  But if you have watched the "Alien" and "Predator" series with any degree of appreciation or affection, you are going to burst out laughing at the final shot of the film.  That is not a good thing in a monster movie.<br /><br />Final Note:  The Zenith City is so off the beaten path that we do not have enough screens to accommodate all of the movies this summer.  Consequently, when I went to go see "Alien vs. Predator" the markee outside the theater announced one of the other movies to be "Exorcist Without a Paddle."  Admit it.  Already you can envision the story line about how Father Merrin is up the proverbial creek and the deep announcers box intoning "Exorcist Without a Paddle."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Be careful of what you wish for"></head><body><p>I just saw "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" (...). It is one of the films that I was dying to see. I am by no means a fan of most of Jim Carrey's films but "Eternal Sunshine..." really appealed to me when I read about it in a recent issue of IFC magazine as well as saw a trailer for it. I was intrigued by the concept of having the opportunity to erase painful memories and start over with a clean slate. <p>Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play Paul and Clementine, a couple who are in a volatile relationship. Paul is the straight guy to Clementine's unpredictable, impulsive nature. They are complete opposites. Nevertheless the pair manages to connect on an emotional level. Unfortunately the camel's back breaks and on an impulse, Clementine decides to start over on a clean slate and forget about Paul by having a memory specialist played by the talented Tom Wilkinson, erase her memories. Paul is devasted when he finds out what Clementine does so he follows suit. What happens next is a chain reaction. I got to see Paul and Clementine's relationship, the good, the bad, and the ugly through Paul's eyes. The lesson here is that we should be careful of what we wish for because it might actually happened. In Paul's case, he realized that having his memories of Clementine erased was not a hot idea. Another lesson here is learning to appreciate life and Paul figures that out just as his memories are being slowly deleted. I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline between Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo. I really wasn't expecting their personal involvement with each other or with Clementine. It was enjoyable enough not to detract from the main storyline of the movie. <p>I will admit that I have never seen ADAPTATION or the entire BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (well some I have seen on Comedy Central) but ETERNAL SUNSHINE...reminded me a bit of 21 GRAMS in the way the film was shot. I really didn't understand the opening sequence to the film until towards the end of the movie. And at one point, I was confused about the way Paul and Clementine first met. I thoroughly enjoyed ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. It is one of the most original films I have seen in years.</p></body></html>

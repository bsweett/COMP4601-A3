Bruce Willis plays someone that is on the edge of loosing everything: his family. Though the topic of unfaithfullness is addressed you can tell that there is something truly devistating between his life, and his wife's (Robin Wright Penn). The once avid spark of love has fragmented and broken, and for this reason, he takes a train ride to get a new job in New York. If the job turns out, he is leaving his wife and son. It is on this train that something tragic, and wonderful happens. The train crashes, killing every passenger...except him. He survives without a scratch. Samuel L. Jackson plays a comic book dealer that is full of dark secrets, and knows after reading about Willis's survival in the train crash, that perhaps a life long search is over. Jackson is a character that has a disease in which he is very fragile, and breaks like glass. Maybe, just maybe, the survivor is his exact opposite. Someone that can withstand anything, and can't be sick, or injured. And, he believes, that superheroes could possibly exist. As he is fragile like glass, maybe there is someone on the other end of the spectrum that is unbreakable. <p>The reason Unbreakable is so important, is if in fact there is to be a trilogy about a hero, won't you wanna find out where he came from? What was his original drive? I think one day we will look back on this movie as the first superman, or matrix. The story behind the story. That does something great. It promises No Prequals, and No bloody six year wait, as in the Star Wars series. I recommend this movie for sixth sense fans, and to those of you who love a good surprise ending. And it helps if your tastes border on drama/thriller/suspense. After watching it once I bet you'll wanna watch it again. That to me is the first and foremost way to rate a movie...the re-watch factor. Once just ain't enough. Unbreakable taunts your brain and raises a lot of questions, and is entirely believable. As for other movies I had high hopes, but this time I wasn't let down. After you watch it you will probably roll the plot around in your mind and wonder whether or not you have ever been injured, sick, or broken... Well...have you?</p></body></html>

(2) U.S. President Merkin Muffley, and (3) Dr. Strangelove himself. You will also no doubt recognize George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens and a very young James Earl Jones.<br /><br />General Jack Ripper has gotten "a little funny," as President Muffley puts it, and gave the order for the Strategic Air Command (planes always in the air) for Plan R, which was intended to be the American response if the Soviets had blown up Washington and higher command (presuming including the President and the Joint Chiefs) were unavailable. A "disclaimer" at the beginning of the film states that the U.S. Air Force assures us all that it could not happen like this.<br /><br />Anyway, General Ripper not only set the planes carrying nuclear weapons to bomb Russia, he cut off all communication from his base to the outside world so that no one could countermand the order. Only he had the code which could recall the planes.<br /><br />Much of the action takes place in the Pentagon war room, where a huge map displays the paths of the SAC planes as they head for targets in Russia. I'd ruin half the fun of the humor if I told you too much, but suffice it to say that this movie puts forth the obvious fact that nobody -- not generals, not politicians, not anyone -- was prepared to cope with this kind of an emergency. Except Dr. Strangelove, of course. He has an idea for everything. Now if he can only remember to stop calling the president "mein fuhrer."<br /><br />One wrinkle occurs when the Soviet ambassador is called in and talks to the Premier on the hot line. He discovers that the Doomsday Bomb will be automatically triggered if any of these planes reach their targets.<br /><br />You wouldn't think the destruction of the world would be funny, would you? Still, when you hear General Ripper explain to Captain Lionel Mandrake why he did it ("our precious bodily fluids"), and then see Keenan Wynn soberly warn that if he obeys Captain Mandrake and shoots the lock off the Coke machine to get change for the pay phone so he can call the President, the Captain will have to "deal with the Coca Cola Company," you just can't help laughing. There are hundreds of laughs in this movie, just to show you that annihilation of the planets human and animal life is indeed a laughing matter.<br /><br />Try to believe the Air Force's disclaimer, and learn to stop worrying. After all, the Soviets are no more, so we don't have to worry about the bomb anymore, right? Isn't that right? Sure it is!</p></body></html>

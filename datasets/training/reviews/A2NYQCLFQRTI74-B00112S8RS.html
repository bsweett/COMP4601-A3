<meta name="summary" content="unoriginal ending"></head><body><p>Hoffman and Hawke play 2 brothers. Because they need money, they plan a robbery, that goes wrong... very wrong.<br /><br />Hoffman and Hawke's performances are quite good, so is Marisa Tomei's and the other supportive actors'.<br />The script isn't that original, you can predict what will happen, and it's really too bad, because there were many possibilities, and unfortunately the scriptwriters didn't choose an original ending.<br /><br />All in all, I can't really say I "enjoyed" this film, nor would I recommend it to anyone.</p></body></html>

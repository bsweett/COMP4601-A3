<meta name="summary" content="Too hot for Hal"></head><body><p>The U. S. Government now has a super computer capable of accessing every electronic device ever invented and can conduct even through liquid when push comes to shove. Its super duper computer spy network is called "Eagle Eye," and it means something more powerful than Big Brother is watching. It is a she and she is wired/programed/processed/evolved to go beyond the confines of her gold globes and her 36 floors underground below the Pentagon.<br /><br />Early on, Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBoeuf) is forced to follow Eagle Eye's orders, as is Michelle Monagham's character. The early chase scene in which they are involved put me on my feet from wildly choreographed car collisions, and the whirligig cranes were beyond believable, creating pure adrenaline rushes.<br /><br />All the impossible machinations controlled by Eagle Eye are just too incredible to be vaguely believable. On the other hand, remember Hal? "2001: Space Odyssey" was uniquely far-fetched, too. A computer that would kill all the astronauts but one and take control of the spacecraft? We accepted that premise, didn't we? It's not much different with Eagle Eye, except her power is inordinately more powerful.<br /><br />As for the ending that meets with disagreement in some of these reviews, my question is: Why not that ending? What we thought was the ending is not in keeping with the powerhouse story. It would be anti-climatic.<br /><br />Special kudos go to Rosario Dawson and Michael Chiklis, both of whom lend credence to the story. As for Billy Bob Thornton, his pancake makeup was so thick as to be the most laughable part of the story! A high-ranking FBI agent wearing all that makeup! Now that's unbelievable!<br /><br />If you are looking for a message, consider the potentially dangerous power of a super computer gone rogue. Do we even know if the government has a super computer?<br /><br />Even if you can't concede Eagle Eye's all-pervasive powers, just grumble over the premise, then relax, and enjoy the non-stop action. Actually, there is no relaxing in this film. Buckle in and get ready for non-stop thrills.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="surprisingly quite good"></head><body><p>I am always very skeptical about the big budget productions that exploit historical occurences using typical suspense and dramatic techniques, but somehow fincher's 'zodiac' succeeded brilliantly and is extremeley captivating proving that old formulas can still work providing that everything comes together and is thought out well...<br />First off the mood of the film is pitch perfect, coming into it you are expecting a blood and guts type film but you will soon realize that it is going to be a lot more sly and intelligent than that.. as fincher crafted a very careful character study which details this puzzle of a story..<br />Secondly, the acting is top notch almost reminding me of how directors like hitchcock, polanski, or coppola were able to get fresh and vibrant performances out of actors who you might think could just go on autopilot and collect their paycheck at the end without really caring..<br />The most important aspect of the movie, however, is how the historic timeline of the movie does not get in the way.. The film seems very true to its sources and yet it doesn't seem to sacrifice its own artifice for their sake (a mistake so many films of this genre make in my opinion)<br />So hats off to a truly chilling piece of work...</p></body></html>

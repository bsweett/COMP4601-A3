<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE BEST MONSTER MOVIES IN A LONG TIME!"></head><body><p>I have to say I've grown tired of monster films in recent years as they all seem to have one thing in common.....they suck! 'The Mist' is a great example of taking the best from the old and the best from the new and blending them together for a damn good thriller! The FX are very good, the atmosphere is creepy and the tension is high in this well acted deliberately paced horror/sci-fi throwback to the days of drive-ins! I couldn't help but think of my old PS2 game 'Silent Hill' a little watching this film, with it's thick mist and sirens hauntingly sounding in the background. The two disc DVD edition is especially nice with a cool black and white version on the film, plus enough extras to keep any monster fan happy for a while!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Thrill Of The Story"></head><body><p>The popularity of Swedish writer Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy published posthumously has won the hearts and minds of the world and in the last year in the United States.<br /><br />'Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' is a classical suspense story of a journalist who teams up with a Goth computer hacker to solve the forty year old case of a missing young woman from a wealthy family. The film also has a splendid acting role from Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist. Rapace is a face to remember, as she has a great amount of talent as a heroine.  A disgraced reporter named Mikael Blomkvist (Nyqvist) with Lisbeth Salander (Rapace) solve the disappearance of the teenage girl in a rural area of Sweden. This is a dark engrossing film that will have you twitching and covering your eyes at times. There is sexual violence and hard hitting violence of all kinds. The premise is the violence against women in that culture. There are certainly many unhinged people in this film, is it the long cold winters?<br /><br />This is a Swedish film with English sub-titles, but that does not detract from the film one iota. The soundtrack is as dark as the film, and when all comes together, there is a sigh of relief. But, now we know, this is but the first one of three films and I will wait with baited breath for the next two. This film might be an equal to the novel- Hollywood cannot make it any better than what we have right here.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 07-20-10<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030745455X">The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307594777">Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy Bundle: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest</a></p></body></html>

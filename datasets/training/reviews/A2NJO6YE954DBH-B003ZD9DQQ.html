<meta name="summary" content="A German film about the last ten days of the Third Reich"></head><body><p>"Der Untergang" (Downfall) is a German production (filmed in Petersberg, Russia ironically enough) that tells the story of the last ten days of Third Reich, told mainly from the perspective of those in the bunker of Adolf Hitler.  But it begins with a scene from 1942 when young Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is hired by the Fuehrer as a secretary.  Then we jump ahead to Berlin in 1945, with the Soviet army enclosing the city and Frau Junge still by Hitler's side.  The screenplay by Bernd Eichinger is based on not only Junge's memoir, "Until the Final Hour" (written with Melissa Muller), but also Joachim Fest's "Inside Hitler's Bunker."  Junge's story was told in a 2002 documentary, "Im toten Winkel - Hitlers Sekret&auml;rin" ("Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary"), which I will be watching next week.  I decided I watched to watch this dramatization first and then watch the documentary.  The real Junge, who died in 2002, appears at the beginning and end of "Der Untergang," providing a context for the story in keep with our perspective on Hitler and Nazi Germany from the vantage point of the start of the 21st century.<br /><br />Basically what we have here with "Der Untergang" is a horror movie.  Director Oliver Hirschbiegel makes it clear that the machinery of destruction did not stop with the death of Hitler, which is why this 2004 film is about the last ten days of the Third Reich rather than just the last ten days of the life of Adolf Hitler.  In fact the deaths of Hitler and Eva Bruan take place off question with the sound of the bullet that Hitler shot through his brain letting us know the Fuehrer is tote.  Throughout the film Hirschbiegel makes a point of refraining from showing us Nazis shooting themselves, choosing most of the time to show us their corpses (yes, there are some exceptions to this rule, but by the time the camera pans away right before Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) shoots his wife Magda (Corinna Harfouch) and then himself, the point has been made.  The voyeuristic emphasis here is not on death but the fact that even with Soviet artillery shelling Berlin and Soviet troops a few hundred meters away, there were so many Nazi officers who were willing to fight to the end or blow their brains out to follow their Fuehrer off to Hell.<br /><br />Traudl Junge is a spectator to most of what goes on and we know that she is going to survive what is to come just as we know that Hitler will not.  Consequently there are other figures who emerge as being more interesting because we do not know if they are going to get out of Berlin alive.  For me the two key characters because Professor Werner Haase (Matthias Habich), a member of the S.S. who thinks it is long past time that the insanity stopped, and young Peter Kranz (Donevan Gunia), decorated by Hitler for having destroyed two Soviet tanks with his bazooka and embarrassed by having his father (Karl Kranzkowski) try to drag him off the front line because the war is lost and he wants his son to come out of it alive.  One thing that this movie makes clear is that being a good German (to wit, wanting the nation to survive) has absolutely nothing to do with being a good Nazi (to wit, death before, during or after defeat), but perhaps its greatest strength is in showing the environment that can help us understand (but not accept) why it is nobody ever just pulled out their pistol and blew Hitler's brains out long before he did it himself.<br /><br />I cannot speak to the authenticity of the events depicted, but they certainly ring true and hold with what historical details I do know about those last days in the Bunker.  Hirschbiegel even adds an additional element of horror to Magda Goebbels's murder of her six children but having one of them fight being administered the sleeping potion that would allow her mother to slip a cyanide capsule into her mouth.  As for Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Adolf Hitler, what I think I got out of watching the film is that Hitler was nice to women and that they worshipped him, some, such as Hanna Reitsch (Anna Thalbach), more than others.  But whether it was simply ingrained manners or a measured response to deep adoration, it is hard to tell.  Not that it matters much in the end, because even if Hitler can be seen as being human that does not make him any less of a monster.<br /><br />In fact, it can serve to magnify the horror.  When Hitler marries Ava Braun the presiding official is required by the Race Laws of Nazi Germany to ask the Fuehrer and his bride if they are of pure Aryan origins.  Given that the Nazi ideal is a tall, clean shaven, curly haired blond Bavarian and Hitler is a short man with a dishevelled mop of dark hair and a Charlie Chaplin mustache who came from Austria, it seems obvious to me that Hitler is one of the least Aryan looking Nazis.  But you do get a sense of Hitler's charisma and the power he holds over these others is clearly absolute.  Even as Berlin is crumbling the Nazi's struggle to order remains paramount, and if there is any clear contrast between Nazi Germany and modern America it is that the government can make all the calls for order that it wants, but we are not willing to simply shut up and go along like sheep to the slaughter.</p></body></html>

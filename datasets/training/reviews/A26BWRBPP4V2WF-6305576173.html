<meta name="summary" content="An old-time comedy - with all the goods and bads that come with it; a pretty good DVD edition"></head><body><p>Young Frankenstein is certainly a classic film, and I feel somewhat bad about giving it only 3 stars.  The film shows its age, not in the jokes themselves, but in the way they are delivered.  I've never liked films that wink too much at the audience, and Young Frankenstein winks constantly - especially Igor, but also the monster and others.  I found that every time this happened, I was taken out of the movie and reminded that I was watching something, which was distracting and ultimately causes me to remove one star.  The other star is removed because, well, it's not The Producers, which is, for my money, a better (and funnier!) film.<br /><br />A plot synopsis is probably not required, as the film is a spoof-homage (almost equal parts each) of the various Golden-Age Frankenstein films.  Young Dr. Frankenstein ("It's pronounced Fronk-en-steen") is ashamed of his famous anscestor until he learns he is the sole heir to the family's estates.  He arrives in Transylvania and finds Igor ("It's pronounced Eye-gore") and the original doctor's book "How I Did It".  He resolves to build his own monster to prove that with a good brain it would give a good monster.  Unfortunately, Igor screws up and we're left with the standard grunting and homocidal monster.  This does lead to the two greatest set-pieces in the film, however: Frankenstein and the monster performing "Putting on the Ritz" and the monster's visit to a blind and clumsy hermit monk.  These scenes are laugh-out-loud funny even on repeated viewings, and it all depends on the performance of Peter Boyle as the monster.  In fact, Boyle's and Teri Garr's (as the ditzy lab assistant) performances are the best in the film.<br /><br />This is a fine DVD edition - Mel Brook's audio commentary is surprisingly interesting and informative.  It's especially good to hear him admit his mistakes (he wanted to cut the 'Putting on the Ritz' scene) and other inside information.  Less interesting are the deleted scenes (most are not that funny, although I liked the "Reading of the will" cut scene). The outtakes are mostly people laughing and ruining the shot, so get boring quickly.  The audio and video are very crisp and clean, probably better than the original run film prints!</p></body></html>

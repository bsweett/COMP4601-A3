<meta name="summary" content="Silly, but a lot of fun!"></head><body><p>Watching this movie I was trying to compare it to other comedies I have seen.  I guess it similar in humor type to the first National Lampoon Vacation film with both serious and silly mixed in.<br /><br />The movie is one of those that begins showing you the near ending of the movie where a guy is calling the fiancee of his friend to tell her that her husband to be will not be showing up to their wedding which is due to start in five hours.  Most of the rest of the movie attempts to tell how this happened.<br /><br />A guy about to be married goes to Vegas with three friends.  One is a total "John Belushi type" and the other two are his friends.  One friend is in a relationship with an overly controlling woman and he lies to her telling he is going on a wine tasting business trip to Napa Valley.<br /><br />The four take a very expensive suite in Vegas and go up to the roof to drink a toast to their friendship and the upcoming wedding of their friend.  The next thing they know they are waking up in their suite the next day which has been trashed and has both a live tiger in the bathroom and a baby (see the poster) in it and their friend to be married has disappeared.<br /><br />The rest of the movie has them trying to piece together what happened the previous night and to locate their missing friend.  They learn they had done unbelievable things and have both a crimelord and Mike Tyson after them.  The movie is very different from most of the comedies that have come out in the last year or so and a lot more fun than most especially the prolifieration of the Jude Apatow movies that seem to constantly come out.</p></body></html>

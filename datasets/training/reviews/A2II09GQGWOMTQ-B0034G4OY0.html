<meta name="summary" content="Interesting...."></head><body><p>I saw the preview for this when I was watching another movie, I honestly don't remember which but this one looked interesting enough to warrant a rental.<br />The first thing that shocked me was that it was an Eastwood movie.<br />I didn't think this was his sort of thing but he did an excellent job here.<br /><br />Here is what I liked...<br />Excellent performances from the entire cast especially Damon.<br />Beautiful direction.<br />An interesting story.<br />You really have to be interested in the subject of the paranormal to enjoy this movie.<br />Most movies usually make this subject out to be some sort of joke but that is thankfully not the case here.<br />We get three stories that are interwoven and everything wraps up into a neat little package at the end.<br />I have heard other people say this movie was boring and nothing happens.<br />I disagree....nothing happens, everything sort of unfolds...<br />A patient viewer will be rewarded by this movie.<br />If you're expecting a "Bourne" flick, go elsewhere.<br />This is a VERY slowly paced movie, there's not a whole lot of action, just a whole lot of emotion and story which for once is a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the ending.<br />I DID NOT want the movie to end that way, I won't give it away but I found the ending to be rather annoying.<br />For a movie with so many loose ends for it to wrap so nicely seemed to contradict the entire movie itself.<br />That minor gripe aside, I found it to be a beautiful movie on a an interesting subject.<br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

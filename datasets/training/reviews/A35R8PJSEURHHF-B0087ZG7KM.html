<meta name="summary" content="Disappointed"></head><body><p>You know what, this movie wasn't actually that funny.<br /><br />Then, they throw in the cliche romance for the main character that follows the typical love, someone gets mad at someone, and then love again by the end of the movie plot........<br /><br />Some of the comedic lines delivered in this movie seemed improvised or on-the-spot.  Who acts like this?  No one.  No one is going to meet someone for the first time and then say how they broke a child's blanket in half because it was so full of dried semen.  The lines were so over-the-top and ridiculous.<br /><br />Some scenes that could have had anyone on the floor with laughter were not pushed far enough.  The movie wound up just being really cheesy and full of scenes of improvised, badly-acted lines and lame jokes. (the one woman takes about 10 puppies from the bridal shower  -  who cares, it's not funny.<br /><br />The scene where the bride had diarrhea in the street:  you saw nothing but her sitting on the ground.  How was that funny?  Should of had it all over her dress, she could have slipped on it........<br /><br />The point is, you can't try act serious (as with the street crap scene) but then go OVER THE TOP the next minute.  Either you do it, or you don't.  And this movie only did it half-way.<br /><br />blah</p></body></html>

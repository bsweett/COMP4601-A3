On my first viewing of the film, I remember enjoying it but thinking it was not worthy of the Oscar for best picture over Up in the Air, Avatar or Inglourious Basterds. Having seen it recently for a second time that feeling remains intact; but now I can proudly consider it worthy of its place among the top five best films of 2009. If you haven't yet seen it, you seriously need to.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker holds a place dear to me on a few personal levels. The first being that it is an independent film (a world that I myself am entering into); and the second is that its story centers on soldiers fighting in the Middle East (something of which I have experience in).<br /><br />Jeremy Renner earns his first of two Oscar nominations as Sergeant James; an EOD bomb tech who is a little too proud of his work ethic for the comfort of his comrades. And for those of you who aren't familiar with the term EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal), they are an elite group of soldiers whose sole mission is to find and disarm bombs. And I'll give you another one up front: an IED is an improvised explosive device. The story takes place back in a 2004 Baghdad, Iraq.<br /><br />After their bomb tech is killed in an explosion, Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are awarded with a new one: Sergeant James. Eldridge and Sanborn had a good thing going, they work by the book, and they're but a few weeks shy of going home.<br /><br />So when James comes into the picture with his carefree tactics and cocky attitude; they are a little on edge. That James is efficiently skilled and gifted at what he does only makes matters worse for all three of them; because James is very aware that he posses these skills, and takes great joy in the adrenaline rush they reward him with.<br /><br />Sanborn and James butt heads from the get-go and Sanborn quickly realizes his last few weeks are going to be among his longest. Imagine working with someone who is very good at what they do, but their cockiness is sure to get you and them fired, and they don't seem to be the least bit concerned. Now amp up the volume on that little scenario by replacing the word fired with the word killed.<br /><br />James smokes frequently (even when handling dangerous explosive materials), he's all too eager to get his hands dirty when the situation doesn't necessarily call for it, and he doesn't seem to have much to live for other than the thrill of the job. And he likes to take his time when defusing these bombs, regardless of the fact that his team, himself included, are completely in the open and could be killed at any moment. The sheer fact that they are there to begin with, alerts massive suspicion to the townspeople.<br /><br />As nuts as this may seem, ask yourself if you were holding security for someone defusing a bomb; if you'd like that person to be as comfortable as possible when doing so. This is James' take on his work ethic, and it makes perfect sense.<br /><br />One thing you have to understand about the conflicts in the Middle East, whether it's Iraq or Afghanistan; the battlefield is everywhere. There is no safe point or zone; some are safer than others, sure. There is no one outside the wire you can fully trust: the enemy could be anyone, anywhere at any time, and they don't play by the rules. Harmless seeming objects such as cell phones, video cameras, and even kites, all have the potential of being tools of deadly destruction over there.<br /><br />The film rides on suspense driven scenes of: A. a guy defusing a bomb; and B. his security team surrounded by people who may want to kill them, may have the means to do so, and may be directly responsible and capable of detonating that very bomb. If that doesn't make for a good thriller, then I don't know what would.<br /><br />The Academy Award winning screenwriter (Mark Boal) spent time in Baghdad with a real EOD team and the film proves it. He nailed every detail from the soldier favorite juice boxes, to the Military jargon, to the shocking realization of just how far these people are willing to go to hide their IEDs in innovative ways.<br /><br />His goal here was not to make a big Hollywood action movie, but to tell a good story, and to stay true to the men and women who serve by keeping the film believable. There are a few Hollywood moments in the film for sure, but every single thing that happens could realistically happen in real life; maybe not to the same three guys, but hey.<br /><br />Mark's efforts are only matched perfectly by director Kathryn Bigelow who also won the Oscar for directing. They could have taken this project to a major studio who would have given them millions of dollars to film it in Arizona or Nevada. But instead they sought out investors overseas and filmed the movie independently and properly in the Middle East; and their hard work and commitment has paid off. There are six little shiny gold men resting on glamorous shelves somewhere, to prove it.</p></body></html>

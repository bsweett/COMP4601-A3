Unlike most other action movies, it's not laden down with total explosions in every scene. Some comic lines were thrown in, as well as one very angry off Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg did an excellent job portraying Bobby Mercer, but the major surprise was Andre 3000. With no huge action or acting experience, he took on the role and nailed it. With the help of Garrett Hedlund and Tyrese Gibson, "Four Brothers" showed how one diverse family can come together to avange their mother.</p></body></html>

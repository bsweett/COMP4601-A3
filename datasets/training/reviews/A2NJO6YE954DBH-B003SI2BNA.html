<meta name="summary" content="An above average adaptation of another Japanese ghost story"></head><body><p>I actually saw "Honogurai mizu no soko kara," the 2002 Japanese horror film  (2002) that director Hideo Nakata made from K?ji Suzuki's novel I saw this 2005 American remake.  Things have been breaking even for me in that regard when it comes to the recent spate of Japanese ghost stories, what with the "Ringu" films and "Ju-on."  Of course it is a crap shoot as to whether or not you get to see the better version first.  With "Dark Water" I think the American version by director Walter Salles ("Diarios de motocicleta") is a slightly better made film, but I really liked the coda to the Japanese version more than the "happy" ending of this one ("happy" being very much a relative term under the circumstances).<br /><br />Screenwriter Rafael Yglesias succeeds in Westernizing the story so that viewers unfamiliar with the rules of Japanese ghost stories can get into the spirit of things.  Dahlia Williams (Jennifer Connelly) is recently divorced from Kyle (Dougray Scott) and in a bitter custody battle for their young daughter, Ceci (Ariel Grade), so she moves into an apartment on the ninth floor of an rather dilapidated building on Roosevelt Island.  Dahlia tells Kyle it is because the place is too blocks from a good school, but it is really because it is all she can afford.  Maybe she believes all the shameless salesmanship of the landlord (John C. Reilly) because she has to, but one look at Veeck (Pete Postlethwaite), the building's super, and we know that the place is a hellhole.<br /><br />Kyle claims that Dahlia is an unfit mother because she is mentally unstable.  Does he really think this is true or is it simply gamesmanship?  For that matter, does he really want his daughter or is it payback because Dahlia did not like the fact he is living with another woman?  This is vitally important because divorce in America is the norm, whereas in Japan it is much rarer and has decidedly different cultural significance for the characters.  So "Dark Water" plays off against our personal reservoir of divorce horror stories, cinematic or otherwise.  But Dahlia has a more immediate concern: there is a leak in the bedroom ceiling that is dripping black water.  Veeck refuses to fix it and Dahlia begins to wonder what is happening in the apartment above her own that would cause the water spot on the ceiling, especially as it grows bigger and more ominous.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ceci's new teacher (Camryn Manheim), is concerned that she is ignoring the rest of the kids in class to play with her imaginary friend whose name is Natasha.  Dahlia becomes concerned too when she learns that a young girl named Natasha lived in the building.  Kyle is moving ahead with suing for full custody, forcing Dahlia to hire a new lawyer, Jeff Platzer (Tim Roth), who works out of his car.  By this point in the film everyone and everything is a potential threat to Dahlia, both in terms of her sanity and with regards to her protecting her daughter.  However, in the end, "Dark Water" comes down to Dahlia having to make a choice, and it is only in the shift in her motivation that the climax of this film loses some of its power compared to the original (the prologue does not come into play as much as it should at the end given the story changes)..<br /><br />For what would still be considered a horror film even if it is more psychological than supernatural for the most part, "Dark Water" has a first-rate cast.  Connelly's best moment usually involve the look in her eyes and nothing she has to say, and casting Grade as her daughter was extremely fortuitous.  Postlethwaite is creepy from start to finish, Reilly does a marvelous job of playing against his previous roles by being so positive, and the almost unrecognizable Roth turns in an outstanding character study as the surprisingly compassionate and competent lawyer.  When a cast can offer the likes of Scott and Manheim in minor roles, you know there is a high bottom to the talent level.  Cinematographer Affonso Beato and composer Angelo Badalamenti create the atmosphere for the horror film, more so than the special effects with all of the titular fluid at the climax, which also speaks to this being an above average horror film and therefore worthy of being checked out.</p></body></html>

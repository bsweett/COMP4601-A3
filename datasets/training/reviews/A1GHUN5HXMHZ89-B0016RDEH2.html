Although this movie is good, the ads made it look like another fantasy movie. I am giving it three stars because of the poor job of promoting the movie. Be warned it is more like "Photographing Fairies" than a childrens movie. I happen to like this type of movie, but I felt this was a touch more brutal than necessary. I like the Grimm fairy tales, but that doesn't mean I need to see the gore in my face to enjoy movies of them. This is rated R so that should be your first clue. The fantasy story sprinkled in amongst the horror did not appeal to the side of me that enjoys movies like "Princess Bride" and "Labyrinth". Although the story is good I don't think you need to slice someones mouth with a razor blade and brutally beat people to make it's point.</p></body></html>

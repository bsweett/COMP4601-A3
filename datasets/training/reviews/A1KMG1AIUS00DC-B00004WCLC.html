<meta name="summary" content="Ambitious, But Overly Long"></head><body><p>"Magnolia,"  from director Paul Thomas Anderson ("Boogie Nights"), takes on the difficult task of focusing on ten major characters who illustrate the film's theme -- that odd things happen all the time and coincidence is inevitable no matter how carefully we plan our lives.  Characters are sent over the brink of polite social behavior by conflicts between offspring and parents, adults against children, employers with employees,  cancer, and fame vs. anonymity.<br /> Julianne Moore and Melinda Dillon play wives to men (Jason Robards, Philip Baker Hall) dying of cancer.  Cocaine addict Claudia (Melora Walters) and former wiz kid Donnie (William H. Macy) are the damaged offspring of cruel parents, while home nurse Phil Pharma (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and cop Jim (John C. Reilly) ooze compassion from every pore.<br /> Most notably, Tom Cruise plays misogynist crusader Frank T.J. Mackey, whose motivational speeches are captivating in style, repulsive in content. The actor has seldom been so fiery on screen.<br /> The problem with "Magnolia" is its length -- over three hours.  This epic running time allows Anderson to explore each of his characters with some depth, but the film never comes together and, at the final credits, remains a collection of interesting scenes and people thrown into an uncertain mix.  Bonus extras include "Magnolia Diary" -- a featurette chronicling the making of "Magnolia" --  a music video, a Frank T.J. Mackey seminar, the infomercial "Seduce and Destroy," and a trailer and TV ads.</p></body></html>

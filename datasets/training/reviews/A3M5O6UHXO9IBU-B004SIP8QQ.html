The classic example was Dennis Hopper's elevation to zietgeist guru after 'Easy Rider' only to rapidly fall after being shipped off to Peru with a budget to play it again, Sam. The self indulgent results were the stuff of legend. Lumbered with a fiasco to rival Norman Mailer's 'Tough Guy's Don't Dance', the studio rightly calculated Kill Bill Vol 2 would have a sufficient fan base to be worth releasing and the die hards would pronounce it a masterpiece anyway. It has made money. Those of you who went to 'Reservoir Dogs' expecting to see 'an amazing, pumping powerhouse of a movie' (as the billing boasted) only to be confronted with a filmed stage play of tedious verbosity, will not be dismayed by the last quarter of Vol 2, which makes boredom almost an art form. I suspect the director is aware of this and took the CSI job to prove to the industry that he could do disciplined work with someone else's script.</p></body></html>

It's a romance, it's a comedy, it's a thriller - three genres that only someone of Alfred Hitchcock's myriad talents could pull off so well. Grant plays an ad exec who the enemy mistakes for an undercover agent; when he realizes the bad guys are after him with intent to do serious bodily harm, he of course takes off running, leaps onto a train, and meets Eva Marie Saint. Romance ensues amid continuing skullduggery. There are several unforgettable scary thriller scenes, including the chase by a plane in the middle of a cornfield and the final beauty on the face of Mt. Rushmore - and the final, final scent back on the train with EM Saint.<br />Top notch entertainment that never gets old.</p></body></html>

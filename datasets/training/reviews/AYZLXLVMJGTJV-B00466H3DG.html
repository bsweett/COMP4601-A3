I like that she and Joel both go to places where not many people visit. I like that they visit empty beaches in the winter, ride buses to empty places and eat at restaurants not filled up with lots of people. I like that Joel writes and makes pictures of things. I like that Kirsten's character likes quotes that make a person think and feel. I like Kate's hair colors and styles. I like her differentness. Why would someone want to erase their memories? That is what the movie is kind of about. How they do it and their experience of it while its being done. Do we just throw away the stuff we don't like? Do we embrace it? I prefer to keep mine. They find out that even though they try to control their thoughts which is also their feelings or vice versa it still doesn't really change who they are. They erase their relationship and connection but they do it all over again anyway. Maybe the erasing helped them to grow because they found out about it. And they got back together with that knowledge. I mainly like the places where you go that hold spirit and aloneness, it is nice to share it with another and that was kind of what Clemintine understood and Joel just did. I liked the chinese restaurant, the neat music, the ending song, the connections of the people.</p></body></html>

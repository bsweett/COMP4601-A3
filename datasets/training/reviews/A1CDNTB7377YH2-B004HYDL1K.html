<meta name="summary" content="This Movie Rocks!"></head><body><p>Having seen Grindhouse, I remember seeing a funny trailer for a movie called Machete.  I am not sure how the actual movie came about: whether this was an actual trailer or Rodriguez decided to make it due to positive comments on the trailer.  Anyway, I had been trying to find time to see this and I just saw it today in an empty theater.  I could not understand why since this film is one of the best action films I have seen in a long time!<br /><br />This movie has everything from a great cast, intriguing and very timely plot and many beautiful women.  I was drawn in from the first five minutes and never able to catch my breath again until the end of the film.  Machete is a Mexican police officer doing a raid on one of the Mexican Cartel heads who has kidnapped a girl.  He is told over his radio to wait for backup before going in.  He tells his partner that he is not waiting for anything but is going in.  His partner is immediately killed but Machete is a one man army (like Arnold in The Terminator) against the bad guys.  When he finally gets to the girl he finds out that it is all a setup by his own boss.  The Cartel Head (Steven Segal) then kills Machete's wife right before his eyes.<br /><br />Fast Forward three years and Machete is in Texas as an illegal alien looking to get by.  Don Johnson is the head of a border militia that guns downs aliens he captures and Robert DeNiro is a corrupt senator that goes on the hunt with Johnson.  Michelle Rodriguez is running a Taco stand while secretly involved in an underground network that gives passage to illegals to the United States and helps them find work.  Jessica Alba is an INS agent watching Rodriguez's stand while trying to catch her doing something that will lead to the head of the underground network.<br /><br />Machete is approached by the Senator's advisor to assisinate the Senator for money.  He reluctantly agrees but is then set up to take a fall.  I don't want to give anything more away about the movie but it is loaded with highly violent and bloody fights including a lot of bad guys getting sliced, diced and gored by Machete's favorite weapon, the machete of course!<br /><br />I loved this movie from start to finish and the ending announces two sequels (not sure if this was Rodriguez just making it up for this movie or if they were real).  If you love the old Charles Bronson Death Wish movies, you will definately love this film.  Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

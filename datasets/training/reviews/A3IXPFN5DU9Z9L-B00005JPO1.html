<meta name="summary" content="Indy Lite - Now with 50% Less Charm!"></head><body><p>Young viewers might find plenty to like in this fast paced, decidedly family friendly affair, but older viewers who know the original films will find the latest installment is missing something essentially 'Indy'.<br /><br />The elements that made Indy so great, the snappy lines, the hunt for artifacts, the ceaseless chasing, are still intact but often seem forced, as if they were added just to make an otherwise stock action film fit the Indie brand. Ford still delivers the goods as Indiana Jones but the new additions to the marquee, including sidekick Labeuof and villain Blanchett, are relatively uninteresting, and the plot gets a tad too convoluted for its own good.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes hint at the possibility of greatness, but sadly the remaining hour or so is mostly mediocre. Perhaps the film was butchered in editing, or maybe Lucas tried to cram too much in from the start, but somewhere along the lines Crystal Skulls lost its charm.<br /><br />While it's good to see Indy dust off his hat for one last globe spanning adventure, I wish the film had been handled with more skill. It entertains for 2 hours but is ultimately forgettable and for the franchise, that's a shame. Somehow I doubt we'll see Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in the same sentence with 'classic' 15 years from now.</p></body></html>

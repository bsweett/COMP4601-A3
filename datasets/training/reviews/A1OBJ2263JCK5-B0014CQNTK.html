Every time I've seen it, I'm all "faklempt" (meaning emotional or choked up for any non-yiddish, speakers out there) by the time the end titles roll. Call me a wimp or a weenie, but this movie gets me every time I see it. But isn't that, what the best movies do? Move something in you, get to your emotions. That was certainly my reaction to "Juno". You can argue the point, but I think that this little, low budget, indie-style comedy was one of the best movies of 2007.<br /><br />"Juno" is the comedy/drama story of Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), a precocious, cocky, wise-cracking teenager, who suddenly finds herself pregnant, after sexually experimenting with her best friend Paulie (Michael Cera). After being put off by a visit to an abortion clinic, Juno answers an ad in the local 'Penny Saver' newspaper for 'adoptive parents'. They turn out to be Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) & Mark Loring (Jason Bateman) a yuppy-ish, childless couple, who have plenty of issues of their own. During the course of the film, we follow the next several months of Juno's life as a pregnant teen and her relationships with her parents, Paulie and the Lorings. What starts off as a very funny, screwball-ish, alternative comedy, eventually evolves into an emotional story, where Juno must find out, that she dosn't have all the answers. The last thirty-some weeks are not just a mere inconvienance, that will soon be forgotten. In the end, Juno must learn to "grow-up real fast", all while finding out the true meaning of love.<br /><br />Don't be put off, if the above plot synoposis sounds a little too much like an old 'ABC After School Special'. This is as far from the standard, Hollywood mush as you can get. First time screen writer, Diablo Cody and Director Jason Reitman have joined forces with a brillaint cast to create an imaginative, smart, well-written film, which is both funny and moving at the same time.<br /><br />I love the fact, that the script dosn't treat the characters or the audience like there a bunch of dummies. When was the last time a Hollywood film about teen pregnancy didn't make the parents out as a bunch of clueless, overeacting, yelling idiots, the teen father-to-be as a jerk or even wealthy yuppies to be one dimensional. Instead, this film very subtlety reveals different layers of these characters. You get to know these people and find out what makes them tick.<br /><br />Ellen Page as the film's title character is just wonderful. Page gives so much nuance in her performance. Just watch the emotions, that run across her face, when she is forced to reveal she's pregnant to her parents. She put in one of the best performances of the year. Hopefully this young actress will have a brillaint career ahead of her. The rest of the cast is equally good, showcasing stand-out performances from J.K. Simmons, Alison Janney, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner and Michael Cera.<br /><br />Finally, mention should also be made of the film's energetic music soundtrack, that features the works of anti-folkie, Kimya Dawson, British  alt-rockers, Belle & Sebastion and other various artists. These songs will get stuck in your head and keep you humming for days.<br /><br />This is a great movie, which has its' fill of both big laughs and tears. Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A mix between Mormonism and Islamism in a cowboy style."></head><body><p>If you were born Mormon, the Book of Eli comes close to describe the Mormons' escape to the west to establish their identity. The only difference was that Joseph Smith believed that people turned black on the first day of the last millennium due to their sins. This movie made a black man the only survival who could recite the Holy Book and preserve it from extinction. The movie replicated the Islamic depiction of the preservation of the Quran by a black man after the death of the prophet. At the end of the movie, the producer did not miss placing the Bible next to the Quran on the same shelf.<br /><br />The chaos that ensued between wars that turned humans into illiterate, belligerent, and ruthless species embodies the turmoil that prevailed in both Mecca, when the Quran was inspired by Muhammad, and Pennsylvania, where the immense space and vast land inspired Joseph Smith to write his own Bible. Eli recites the same shadow of the Holy Ghost that inspired in him the Holy words. Those words kept Eli alive in the `valleys of death' that dominated the land after the wars.<br /><br />The movie dwelled on the classic gray and brown colors to convey the somber predicaments of a human race struck by loss of its intellectual leaders, statesmen, army, and police. The guns, knives, and arrows became the essential tools of warding off ruthless muggers, killers, and robbers. While poverty, illiteracy, and diseases struck the masses, the written words retained their esoteric power to subdue the illiterate, diseased, and desperate wars' survivors. Without the submission of the masses to few men of knowledge, chaos perpetuates disasters, and civilization regresses to the dark ages. Water became the most precious commodity. People ate the flesh of their fellow humans.<br /><br />As Muhammad migrated to the North of Mecca to revive the Quran and escape persecution, Smith and Eli migrated West to resurrect the Holy Bible. Faith kept Eli walking on the roads for thirty years to his destiny in San Diego where he found the right folks who could scribe his Holy words.  Eli rests in piece after his mission was accomplished. One major glitch was that Eli killed too many people in order to survive to deliver his Holy book to the hands that could preserve it. Muhammad on the other hand never wrote the Quran, but rather lived and taught the Quran to transform stray followers to the right path. Muhammad was illiterate but his words and deeds subdued the most influential figures in Mecca and Medina including those who recorded the Quran after Muhammad's death. Returning to Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon got Smith killed for his failure to proved the real evidence of the source of his revelation.<br /><br />Eli's prophecy holds credence on the basis of its high probability, viewed in the context of the existence of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of governments that lack the scrutiny of the people it governs. The Anthrax scare that caused the loss of few lives has never been traced to its roots despite its occurrence in the center of the American government and its highly sophisticated laboratories. Nor could any reasonable person deny that all governments cover up on their internal failure and corruption. When mass destruction ensues, figures like Eli would fit the role perfectly. His swift action, lack of trust, and faith in destiny saved him in the final days of judgment.<br /><br />The Saturday show when the movie opened, the theatre was fully packed. Only one woman with her 10 year old exited as the gruesome scenes of murders kept coming. The classic art, the biblical notion, the richness in action and killing, attracted many viewers. Of course, Stalin's book was displayed to show the need for a mass murderer that could bring chaos to order. Kentucky Fried Chickens ' wet towels and another commercial gum also capitalized on the advertisement opportunities of the big name Eli.<br /><br />The modernization of the "Message" by Anthony Quinn, in a cowboy epic of highly powered guns, explosive, destruction, excessive murder, and very rich artistic sceneries made the movie appeal to the short attention span of the contemporary generation.<br /><br />It is all about the BOOK, the Holy words, and the power of conviction that civilization rises and falls.</p></body></html>

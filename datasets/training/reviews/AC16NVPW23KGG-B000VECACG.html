There are also scenes that were dropped for the 1981 Special Edition release that are included here such as the Air Force press conference, and the footage of Dreyfuss tearing up his neighbors duck pond and yard to create his Devil's tower.  One thing is missing however, and I think Speilberg made a mistake not to include the footage of Dreyfuss going inside the mothership on this version. Sound is incredible on DVD version. Special features include trailers, teasers, outtakes, and a cool documentary with interviews by cast and crew.</p></body></html>

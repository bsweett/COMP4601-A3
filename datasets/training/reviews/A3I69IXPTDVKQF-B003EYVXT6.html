<meta name="summary" content="The Horror Of The Hybrid - But Not How You'd Necessarily Expect"></head><body><p>On the cutting edge of science, things are now becoming possible that used to be only the province of tales like Dr. Moreau and Frankenstein.  And in the highly authentic-feeling "Splice", the central question is, as it has been in many great tales from at least "Frankenstein" onward: with this power, will humanity be able to distinguish between the issues of "what can and can't be done" and "what Should and Shouldn't" be done?<br /><br />  Two scientists, excellently played by Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody, are in the field of splicing genes from different species into one another to create new lifeforms.  Though there's a question right and there about ethics, at least the motivations are noble - trying to find cures from disease through new biochemicals, etc.  There's a striking but believable self-contradiction in the main characters right there: though they seem attached and even, at times, almost parental in their feelings toward these hybrids, they have no emotional or ethical objection against just how they use these creatures in pursuit of their goals, or in disposing of them when it comes to that.  It's when the pair goes against all guidelines and laws by adding human DNA into the mix that things get taken to a much higher level.<br /><br />  The result of the human-animal splice is Dren, a strange little creature that in its infancy appears alternately comical and deadly.  The researchers are initially prepared to destroy the hybrid - they never intended to let it get past the stage of an early embryo, then destroy it there and research the remains.  But among Dren's wonderous physical properties is a phenomenally fast growth rate, and by its birth that growth rate is already spinning things out of control.  Finding themselves unable to kill a newborn hybrid with human DNA and some human characteristics, they hide Dren's existance from their peers and begin to study her.  They bond quickly with Dren, with Polley's character first assuming a distinctly mother-like role to the fast-growing Dren.  As Dren grows, she becomes extremely intelligent, and the bonds within the group start to take on very disturbing overtones.<br /><br />  Like the Frankenstein creation, Dren - who contains not only human DNA but genes from a whole battery of creatures including scorpions, birds, amphibians, and heaven knows what else - is both the movie's "monster" and its victim.  The horror escalates - not in a "the world's going to end tomorrow" kind of way, but in a manner that sees everything going to hell in a handbasket within the main group of characters, and slowly starting to spiral out to those around them.  Among the movie's most potent fright weapons is the disturbingly plausible feeling it has - that eventually, somebody, somewhere, will go and do something like this, if for no other reason than to prove that they can.  And that the results might be just as unpredictable and ghastly as they are here.<br /><br />  Great special effects and a plot that takes classic themes and moves them into even more twisted territory add to the whole.  Great movie, nine out of ten.</p></body></html>

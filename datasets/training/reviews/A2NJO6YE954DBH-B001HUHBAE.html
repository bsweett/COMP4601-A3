<meta name="summary" content=""Zodiac" shows that there is more than one way to lose your life to a killer"></head><body><p>Ultimately, the fatal flaw in "Zodiac" is that the film fails to maintain the courage of its convictions. Given the impulse towards narrative completeness it is difficult to make a movie about a serial killer that has never been caught, and the tagline for this 2007 film comes up with an ideal solution with the whole idea that "There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer." That appellation applies to a trio of characters in director David Fincher's film. Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) is the lead detective on the case and Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) is covering the murders for the San Francisco "Chronicle," and they are going to devote years to the pursuit of the killer. Then there is Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist for the paper who becomes obsessed, first with the cryptograms the Zodiac sends to the "Chronicle" and then with figuring out the killer's identity.<br /><br />The trailer for "Zodiac" makes it clear that Graysmith is the main character in the film, and the screenplay is based on the book that Graysmith wrote about the case. But he really does not emerge as such until the second half of the film, by which time Avery has moved on to a different paper and Toschi has put the case on the back burner, mainly because Zodiac has stopped killing. Or perhaps he has only stopped boasting about it to the press and the police. Graysmith cannot let go and continues to investigate on his own until he thinks that he knows who done it. Since the suppositions are Graysmith's, the movie bends to his perspective. Without them, the film cannot pretend to come to any conclusions. However, this runs counter to the tagline that suggests we should view Graysmith's obsession as a bad thing. "Zodiac" tries to walk a thin line and have it both ways but in the end it cannot help but take Greysmith's views as its own.<br /><br />At first I was thinking "Zodiac" was comparable to "All the President's Men" in that the focus is on police procedure and investigative journalism, and you do not actually get to a resolution except in terms of the teletype or the end scrawl. Then I could see how in many ways the Zodiac can be viewed as the American Jack the Ripper, not in terms of the viciousness of his murder but rather because the case will never be solved, so speculation as to the murderer's identity is all we have and we get to run rampant with it. Both cases have website where you can debate who are or are not the victims and see the messages that the killers sent to torment the police. So there is also a sense in which "Zodiac" is attempting to answer the unanswerable question, much like "From Hell," albeit with much more in terms of concrete support (or at least absent evidence to the contrary).<br /><br />The performances by the three principle performers forgives a lot of the faults here. Downey is one of the most mesmerizing actors around today, so it is hard to keep your eye on anyone else when he is on screen. Ruffalo turns in an effectively restrained performance, providing a lot of subtle shadings within the limited range he has hit upon for this role. Gyllenhaal is the one whose character has the greatest arc from start to finish as his obsession with finding the identity of the Zodiac unhinges his life and as much as finding the killer he needs somebody, whether it be Toschi, Avery, or his wife (Chlo? Sevigny) to tell him he is right. Or maybe it could be something as simple as finally getting to look into the eyes of the Zodiac himself.<br /><br />Next year the director's cut of "Zodiac" will come out on DVD, and I suppose I will check it out. But I am inclined to doubt that adding to the film will make it better because all it can really do is expand the various elements and not add additional ones. There was never sufficient proof to warrant the arrest of Graysmith's prime suspect and the film's suggestion that fate allowed time to run out speaks back to the intrinsic need for narrative completeness more than hard facts (although the movie gets points for the character of Toschi sticking to the need for proof that will stand up in court despite the circumstantial evidence that Graysmith amasses by the end of the film). Still, this version of "Zodiac" is well worth watching, even if it proves to be unsatisfying on various levels. The "true" story being told does not allow otherwise.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WITH A FEW MINUSES -------"></head><body><p>I did like the settings and the colors - the acting was excellent - the plot confusing for a while -- in the end just plain gross.<br /><br />Poor, demented Edward -- why didn't he just shoot someone when he had the chance?<br /><br />maybe worth one watching but -------- not worth the aggrevation of finding the Wicker Man.  Could had done without him.<br /><br />Will definitely not keep this one.<br />See it if you must but be it on your head.</p></body></html>

The line after that made my jaw drop and I fell out laughing and rewound it several times to laugh all over again. Did he have to go there? Aw man, that tickled me for the evening. Unfortunately that was about the only time I laughed through the whole movie.<br /><br />The plot is about an ungrateful boyfriend who doesn't realize all of the things his girlfriend does for him. The girlfriend is also a nag who doesn't know when to shut up. Sound familiar? I think this has happened in every relationship, but these two chose a strange way of dealing with it...pouting. They try to act single while living together and go above and beyond to outshine each other, pulling their friends and dates into it, too. The condo goes up for sale, and now they have to argue about that battle.<br /><br />Cons: While the movie did have some sentimental parts and some thought-provoking scenes ("It's not what you think" scene), the funny parts fell flat. The brother who sings was cool for a minute, but it got old fast. The alternate ending should've been cut during the performance part, but it was MUCH better than the chosen ending. The reunion was great, but the singing could've stopped at 45 seconds. We get the point. The rest was just boring. Cowboys and Indians, how NOT clever. But speaking of an alternate ending, I was not at all a fan of the one that the movie really ended with.<br /><br />There was an outtake with an Asian joke that I was none too thrilled about either. Really Vince, you couldn't find anything more original to joke about than math? None of the outtakes were funny outside of the singing brother doing a terrible breakdancing scene at the end.<br /><br />Anyway, the film was okay, but I'm glad I tested it on Netflix instead of buying it. It wasn't for me, but it wasn't terrible either. It was (in my Simon voice) "just okay."</p></body></html>

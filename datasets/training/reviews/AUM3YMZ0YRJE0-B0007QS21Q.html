<meta name="summary" content="ok action mystery, but mediocre sci-fi"></head><body><p>Alas, it is very hard to find great sci-fi these days.  This story takes some of Asimov's ideas - the three laws of robotics, which Asimov posited would be inevitable with the advent of intelligent robots - and jazzes them up with special effects while missing the underlieing point (i.e. that the positronic brian is designed so that robots cannot violate them - the three laws can't be turned off without destroying the function of the positronic brain itself).  That makes this rather feeble as sci-fi, but good enough for casual viewers who want action and images, which seem all that Hollywood is capable of these days.<br /><br />Recommended tepidly.  You can't watch this like 2001 and constantly see more and differently - once you get it, the concept is used up, as is the case with simple who-donnits.</p></body></html>

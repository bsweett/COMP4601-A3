<meta name="summary" content="Earth on Double-Secret Probation"></head><body><p>BRIEFLY<br />-------<br />This is quite a decent remake of the 1951 B&W classic. Early 21st Century technology adds color, better special effects and first-class surround sound and the the Blu-ray edition INCLUDES the complete 1951 classic remastered with 5.1 surround sound.<br /><br />THE FEATURE DISK<br />----------------<br />Has the movie itself and a solid supplement of special features and options such as a commentary sound track, deleted scenes, documentaries on the making of the movie, 'Watching the Skies in Search of ET' featurette, another one titled 'The Day the Earth Was Green', discussing the News Corp's (Fox) efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and a rather silly 'built your own GORT' game.<br /><br />The main Blu-ray specific feature is the PIP Bonus-View titled Klaatu's Unseen Artifacts which consists in watching the movie with a little PIP window showing related information.<br /><br />Video is, obviously, a crisp 1080p and the best audio in English is an extraordinary DTS-HD Master Audio sound track. Alternative Dolby Digital 5.1 sound tracks are available in French and Spanish.<br /><br />Subtitles can be selected for several languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese, Korean and Mandarin.<br /><br />THE DIGITAL COPY DISK<br />---------------------<br />Allows for transfers to PC and Macs. It is not compatible with Sony's PSP or Microsoft's Zune.<br /><br />The access code is set to expire on April 6, 2011,<br /><br />THE 1951 RELEASE DISK<br />---------------------<br />Has the complete 1951 B&W edition on a Blu-ray (NOT a DVD) disk with 5.1 surround sound.<br /><br />THE MOVIE CRITIQUE<br />------------------<br />While I agree that this is a pretty close remake of the 1951 original, it's interesting to note how the driver behind the aliens decision to exterminate humanity changed in very much the same way the UN's claims over individual states' sovereignty changed in the 50+ years since the first movie's release. The 1951 aliens declared they had the right to intervene not because earthlings were slaughtering each other - that was none of the aliens business according to Klaatu - but because Earth was about to become a threat to intergalactic peace. It was the equivalent of these days' preemptive wars of choice where a nation such as Iraq was declared guilty and deserving of bombardment, invasion and occupation for being a future threat to peace on Earth. The aliens of the current release were taking action because they disagreed with the way humans were endangering life on Earth. Having proclaimed themselves the defenders of 'complex life' anywhere in the Universe, these aliens were assuming themselves the right to exterminate the species they found to be a threat to... 'complex life' and were doing it simply because they could - might makes right. This would be the equivalent of the after-the-fact justification of the Iraq intervention as a holy mission to spread human rights, women rights, religious tolerance, democracy, diversity and a free market culture to the occupied country.<br /><br />To the extent that we accept that the motives behind the aliens intervention and the process they followed to decide the fate of humans were well... alien and somewhat hard to comprehend, the new version is not overly-preachy or badly directed or acted. We are spared of any debate over carbon footprints, climate change or the fate of specific species and, instead, all we see is the story of a concerned scientist - Jennifer Connely - and her cute stepson to change the mind of the all-powerful and alien Klaatu and persuade him that humanity should be spared complete extermination, at least temporarily, so that we could prove ourselves worthy of living. There is no point to debate with Klaatu the aliens' right to intervene. They have the ability to do what they please with us because they can so the choice is to either die with dignity or beg for mercy. Jennifer Connely's character begs for mercy and there is no preachiness in that.<br /><br />I have no issues with the acting, by the way. Keanu Reeves was the perfect choice for an alien. He projects aloofness, seemingly unphased by his setting in motion a process that would result in the deaths of billions. Jennifer Connely does not overact either but, as the one determined to save our species, she is believable in her quiet desperation. The cute boy - Jaden Smith - did not bother me too much. I can accept that the sight of a woman taking care of a cute and bratty boy not her son might have contributed to Klaatu's change of mind. The GORT, a CGI creation and not an actor, was in many ways superior to the 1951 version but that's to be expected. Kathy Bates disappoints a little in her depiction of a US Secy of Defense - too open-minded. John Cleese not convincing as a super-bright scientist but his is a secondary part.<br /><br />RATING<br />------<br />It's an enthusiastic 5 stars for the Blu-ray 3-disk edition and somewhere between 3 and 4 stars for the movie itself.<br /><br />I am grateful for the inclusion of the 1951 original, I loved the quality of the picture and found the DTS-HD MA soundtrack to be exceptional. I found some of the special features to be worth watching. The movie itself, while the premise was somewhat dubious - but CAN we possibly understand the aliens' minds before we've met one? - the acting and the special effects were good.<br /><br />Overall, 3.5, rounded up to 4 stars should be well deserved.</p></body></html>

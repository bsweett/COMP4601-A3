The fact that she wrote this screenplay is testament to that fact.  What it is also testament to is that she understands the importance of layering her comedy with drama, and by drama I don't mean your textbook drama of the theatrical kind (although some of that is here too) but what I mean is genuine, heartfelt drama of the almost bitter-sweet kind.  There is a sadness here that meshes beautifully with those `funny moments'.<br /><br />`Bridesmaids', which was marketed as a `Hangover' for chicks (complete with focus on a Las Vegas bachelorette party) is anything but a rehashing of that successful 2009 comedy.  Instead, Las Vegas is a minor scene that doesn't even really happen and so the focus of that event in the trailer was an obvious misleading of audiences, but it was a twist I was so happy to embrace because last thing I wanted to see was this turn into `Hangover' redux.  Instead, `Bridesmaids' tells the story of a Maid of Honor trying to get a grip on her own thankless life while trying to support her best friend, who happens to be getting married.  Annie is so lonely and pathetic and depressed and yet Lillian is glowing with marital happiness.  When Annie meets Helen, Lillian's `other' best friend, a rivalry is born for Lillian's affections and attention and soon the crazy is unleashed in various forms.<br /><br />`Bridesmaids' primary problem is that it doesn't know when to call it a day.  It is probably about twenty minutes too long.  That isn't to say that there is a lot of fluff here, because there really isn't and the more mellow moments (especially concerning Annie's budding romance with traffic cop Rhodes) are needed in developing the film as a whole, but it really should have been trimmed back.<br /><br />The performances are all wonderful.  Wiig is flawless here, truly developing her character beyond the comedic timing.  Just watch her face as she hears about Lillian's engagement.  There is such sadness behind those eyes, such depth of character.  You can see her telling her story without uttering a single word.  Rose Byrne should probably stick to comedy forever since she isn't having much luck with the drama side of things and her performance here is the highlight of her career (she was also lovely in her jovial scenes in `Marie Antoinette').  She is totally on her A-game and delivers some of the film's funniest moments.<br /><br />And I just love Chris O'Dowd!<br /><br />In the end, `Bridesmaids' is a great little film.  It is funny and charming and sincere, which is a hard combination to come by these days, especially in this genre.  Wiig exercises her funny muscle in more ways than one and develops a film that keeps on giving.</p></body></html>

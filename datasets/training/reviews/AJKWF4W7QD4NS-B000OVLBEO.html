<meta name="summary" content="A goofy and surprisingly good comic book blast"></head><body><p>Despite the many negative noses being turned towards Ghost Rider, for a majority of it's running time, the film is a goofy and surprisingly enjoyable comic book blast that remains surprisingly faithful to it's source material.  Avid comic fan Nicolas Cage plays Johnny Blaze, a stunt biker who years before had struck a deal with the devil Mephisto (Peter Fonda) to save the life of his cancer stricken father, and all he had to give up was his soul.  Naturally, no one ever gets away from making a deal with the devil, and Blaze pays the price for his deal when Mephisto's son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) comes with apocalyptic intentions.  Chances are, you already know the rest of the story from this point forward, so I won't waste anymore time in that department.  What makes Ghost Rider enjoyable is that the film doesn't take itself too seriously, and Cage is enjoyably goofy (if slightly annoying) as Johnny Blaze (who personally I always thought was a role tailor made for Kurt Russell, but hey, what do I know?).  Sam Elliot is on board as well as the Caretaker, who is pitch perfect casting, with the only weak points being the overacting Bentley as Blackheart, and Eva Mendes as Blaze's love interest Roxanne.  Mark Steven Johnson, who brought Daredevil to the screen in 2003, fares much better with the material here, and the rampant CGI effects are mostly well done to boot.  For everything it had going against it, Ghost Rider is surprisingly enjoyable, and as long as you don't expect much from it, you'll probably get a kick out of it.</p></body></html>

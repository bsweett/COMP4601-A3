Clementine (played by Kate Winslet) decides she's unhappy in the relationship after yet another fight and goes to a company named Lacuna that specializes in erasing unwanted or unhappy memories from a person's mind. She wants to rid her memory of Joel. Joel (played by Jim Carrey) decides to do the same after he accidentally finds out his former girlfriend has had "the procedure." Unfortunately Joel decides too late--during the procedure--that he doesn't want to forget Clementine. He tries to retain some of his memories of her. Joel dreams of running away with Clementine from the memory erasing process during his sleep. The ending of the film has an unexpected happy twist: The office assistant sends all the patients' files back to them from Lacuna with the possibility that patients can then choose to regain at least some of their memories. Joel and Clementine meet in Joel's apartment and there seems to be hope that they will learn from their mistakes and try their luck at love again.<br /><br />At first the plot can be a bit confusing since the film alternates between flashbacks and the present. Nevertheless, the scenes are actually very carefully thought out and planned--even if you know the plot beforehand you can truly appreciate the movie anyway. The acting is very convincing. Many people have commented that both Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey get to expand themselves in this film: Carrey plays a very shy guy who speaks little, while Winslet plays a loud mouthed free spirit. The cinematography is excellent and many of the character's emotions are so universal we can all relate to them: There is the longing to feel wanted by Joel throughout his life; and the freedom of acting on impulses in Clementine. Great performances are also turned in by Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo as two inept Lacuna employees who don't do a very good job of monitoring Joel during the procedure to erase Clementine from Joel's mind. Although there are some mildly funny moments I would call this film a drama more than a comedy.<br /><br />The DVD comes with great extras including deleted scenes, a conversation between Jim Carrey and the director Michel Gondry, a brief TV commercial for Lacuna as well as a music video.<br /><br />This is a great film for adults; it's not a family film since it does have sex and drug scenes as well as language content. I believe this film is going to be one of the better films of this year and I highly recommend the DVD. BUY IT!</p></body></html>

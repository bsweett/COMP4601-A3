In this regard, Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man 3" is in no way a departure from the first two films; it remains on perfectly equal ground, presenting a story that carefully combines frenetic fight sequences, grandiose science fiction, and an emotional roller coaster. I don't dare assume that this is the best film in the series, nor can I claim that it's the greatest superhero film ever made. What I can say is that, like its predecessors, "Spider-Man 3" is a fun movie that is sure to entertain those who are willing to experience it.<br /><br />The first major scene has Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) lying on a giant spider web in the middle of a park, staring up at the night sky. The romantic aspect plays itself to the fullest, and rightfully so; the emotional core of the story depends on their love and possible engagement, which will be tested in more ways than one. The first test arrives on a rogue meteorite that crash-lands in the park (where it came from is never explained, but I suppose it doesn't really matter); a viscous, shape shifting black goo emerges from its smoldering cocoon. It then attaches itself to Parker's motorbike and follows him home, where it waits. For what is not yet known, but if there's one thing to be sure about in this kind of film, it's that anything from outer space--especially a dark sludge--most likely means trouble.<br /><br />The second test is Spider-Man's fame, which is putting a strain on Parker and M.J.'s relationship. It seems to be going to Parker's head lately, and it shows during an award ceremony (Spidey is given the key to the city for his heroic acts). He swings into the crowd and high-fives a number of kids before doing gymnastics on the stage. He then hangs upside down and asks the presenter--Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard)--to kiss him like M.J. did in the first movie. It was never meant to be romantic; it was only for the sake of publicity. Nonetheless, M.J. is not at all amused. Parker is unconsciously pushing her away to keep his Spider-Man image strong, which doesn't exactly boost her self-confidence. It doesn't help that her dream of staring in a Broadway musical is shattered; the critics have a field day attacking her singing voice, and she's fired from the production.<br /><br />The third test is Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict. Because of a scientific accident only possible in a comic book adaptation, his molecular structure has been altered into grains of sand. At will, he can change from a solid man into the gritty monster Sandman; he can even meld with other forms of earth and make himself gigantic. But what exactly are his motives? I ask this because he was crafted as a sympathetic character: despite having done bad things to people, his only concern is the well being of his young daughter, who's apparently quite ill (with what is never revealed). What makes the situation worse is that he was responsible for the death of Parker's uncle. This ignites a rage within Parker, and it only gets stronger when the black space slime finally makes contact. Not only does it attach itself to his Spider suit, turning it black, it also intensifies Parker's aggression and fuels his hatred. It also makes him arrogant during normal daily life, an aspect that's more comical than serious.<br /><br />The fourth test is rival photographer, Eddie Brock, Jr. (Topher Grace), who threatens Parker's position at the "Daily Bugle." Loud-mouthed Editor in Chief J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) offers a desk job to anyone who can capture an incriminating photo of Spider-Man; this paves the way for a number of circumstances that eventually turn Brock and Parker into bitter enemies. I distinctly remember a scene in a church, in which Brock prays that God murder Parker. How heavy-handed for a superhero story: it could have been humorous had the atmosphere not been so intense. And it gets even more intense when he comes into contact with a bit of the black space goo; it turns him into the vile super villain known as Venom.<br /><br />The fifth and final test is Harry Osborn (James Franco), whose rage over the death of his father is deepening. Having since discovered the true identity of Spider-Man, he now vows to destroy Peter Parker, his former best friend. Not only does he fight with Parker as the New Goblin, he also forces M.J. to break up with Parker. At this point in the story, it's becomes obvious that revenge is the main theme. Granted, this isn't an original idea (consider "Batman"). However, hidden beneath the vengeful layers is the possibility of forgiveness, and that alone made this film a lot more enjoyable. By the time we get to the climactic battle at a construction site (reminiscent of Raimi's own "Darkman"), the audience will discover who can let go of the past and who will remain stuck in the depths of hate.<br /><br />And yes, they'll be treated to a number of impressive battle sequences, all of which rely heavily on computer generated imagery. I purposely avoided elaborating on this; despite being prominently featured, "Spider-Man 3" is about more than its eye candy; it's about balancing its eye candy with its human story. Generally speaking, it worked quite well (I exempt a dance sequence at a jazz club; talk about unnecessary). In fact, the entire "Spider-Man" series worked quite well, and with that, I have only one more thing to say: if you liked the first two, you'll definitely like the third.</p></body></html>

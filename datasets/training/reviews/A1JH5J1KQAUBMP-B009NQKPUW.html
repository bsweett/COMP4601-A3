<meta name="summary" content="Wish they had engineered a better script"></head><body><p>The crew of Prometheus travels to a distant planet in search of the Engineers, whom they believe are responsible for the creation of the human race.<br /><br />This is a tough film to award stars for.  I really wanted to like it and it delivers masterfully on a visual level.  There are also some very good individual scenes.  Unfortunately, the screenplay is pretty much a mess.  It's hard to imagine that such an unprofessional, irrational group of characters would be selected for such an important mission.  Exhibit A: the team members who decide to bail in the middle of a trip to an alien relic because they decide it's too scary but also think it's a good idea to try to pet a weird-looking alien.  The film also raises a lot of unanswered questions about the Engineers and their motivations.  I enjoy it when a well-written film declines to answer all the questions it raises, but this script has so many inconsistencies that any planned ambiguities get lost in the general sloppiness.<br /><br />Nevertheless, since I can't award half-stars, I'm going with four instead of three.  I was consistently entertained by the effects and performances, there are some great set pieces (such as a brutal dust storm), and I can't deny a certain thrill at the iconic sight of (SPOILER AHEAD!) an Engineer transforming into the Space Jockey from "Alien" as he seats himself at the controls of his ship.  I will be there for the sequel.  I want to see what becomes of Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and David (Michael Fassbender).  I will be really wanting to like it and really hoping not to be disappointed again.</p></body></html>

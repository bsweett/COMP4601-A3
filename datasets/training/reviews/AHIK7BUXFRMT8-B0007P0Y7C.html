<meta name="summary" content="Something of a Balance Between Action and Drama"></head><body><p>There is more emotion and drama in this film than one would expect from the type of movie this is represented to be. I can see why those who are dedicated to unstopping carnage would find this one too introspective and reflective on the emotions and much too short on action. At the beginning the viewer is advised of the ongoing battle between the forces of good and evil and then the movie proceeds to explore its manifestation in the lives of a small group of people on both sides of the conflict.<br /><br />There are a lot of flashbacks that show the circumstances surrounding the development of Elektra's personality and priorities and show the internal battles she is waging between anger and love. The horrible circumstances surrounding her discovery of her mother's body when she was a child continues to haunt her and serve as a catalyst for her anger. The movie is primarily about Elektra's development as a fighter for good as she discovers her true nature is more inclined toward good than toward evil. In the course of this discovery she places herself in great danger protecting two people who will have more significance in her life than she ever expects.<br /><br />If one can accept the required assumptions the movie can be entertaining. It is something of a departure from the norm but may be acceptable to some. I rate it not too bad.</p></body></html>

The movie isn't nearly as bad as you'd think and it certainly isn't as bad as the worst of the original Peter Sellers movies.<br /><br />This new updated version of the Pink Panther  - starring cameos by Jason Statham and Clive Owen and featuring a lovely performance by Emily Mortimer - is rather a vehicle for showing the comedic talents of Steve Martin who talks funny with his fake French accent as he assumes the role of the bumbling Inspector Clouseau made famous by Sellers.<br /><br />The story - or what there is of it - begins when Yves Gluant, (Statham) France's most famous soccer coach (and boyfriend of the beautiful pop star Xania (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles) is murdered in plain sight in front of a huge crowd after leading his team to victory against China. By the time anybody notices that Gluant is dead- the priceless Pink Panther diamond has disappeared from his finger.<br /><br />Enter Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) turns to Clouseau (Martin) the least competent cop in France to help solve the mystery. Dreyfus hopes that the press will devote its attention to Clouseau, thus freeing him to solve the crime in a less pressured environment. Dreyfuss has also been nominated for the Medal of Honor for the seventh time and this time he plans to win it at any cost.<br /><br />Much of the movie is composed of sight gags, there are lots of people falling over and running into things and generally being stupid. Much of the witty repartee comes from the chemistry between Martin accident-prone Clouseau and the Martin as the snobbish and patronizing Dreyfuss. Both are extraordinarily vulnerable - Clouseau because of his hubris, pride and insecurity and Dreyfus chiefly because of Clouseau.<br /><br />Martin embeds Clouseau with a touch of the innocent and its this innocence that lends the love story between him and his secretary, Nicole (an adorable Emily Mortimer). But the best thing about the replica is how wholeheartedly Martin throws himself into the physical comedy, which is uniformly hilarious. Most of the laughs are pretty juvenile, aimed for ten year olds, with the only really funny jokes coming from a scene involving flatulence and Viagra.<br /><br />The best part of the film is when the opening titles kicks in with an animated sequence featuring a squat cartoon Clouseau and the slinky panther-playing cat and mouse to the strains of Henry Mancini's sublime burlesque theme. The rest of the film is very much direction by numbers.<br /><br />Even the best Pink Panther movies were never great cinema, just great fun; the scripts were vehicles for Sellers' genius, which combined lordly timing with a gift for absurd physical comedy. He was a buffoon, but he was a buffoon with dignity, Martin does a good job of carrying on the legacy, but one sort of wonders why the series needed to be remade in the first place.

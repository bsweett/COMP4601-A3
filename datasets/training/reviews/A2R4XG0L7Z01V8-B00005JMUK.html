I'd be shocked if I blinked at all, while watching this.<br /><br />I bought this, purely because it was in the sales, and it was on my wishlist. And I needed to spend some money. So I got this.<br /><br />I'd never really heard of Aileen Wuornos before, apart from all the press coverage saying that Charlize Theron was going to play her. Now, I'm more curious about her whole story, and after watching the movie, I'm curious to find out what happened to Selby, apart from the fact they never spoke again. I'm curious to find out why these people like Aileen spend so much time on Death Row, and why they can't be exectuted straight away. To spend 12 years (and more, in the case of Kenny Ritchie) on Death Row, only to die in the end seems pointless.<br /><br />As soon as Charlize appeared on screen as the hard, butch, Aileen, my mouth dropped open. I just could not believe it was the same girl. There's two shots in the movie where she appears topless, and in just her underwear, and it's amazing to see the physical transformation she's gone through just to play Aileen. Charlize, notorious in my eyes for being super skinny, has boobs & a booty, and cellulite. There is a God after all! She gained 30lbs for this movie, and although it's slightly too much, she looks better with a little bit more flesh. She's so tall (5ft 9 and a half - the half is always important), that she can carry it off well, whereas, Christina Ricci, who only gained 10lbs, looks plain dumpy. After a while, you stop comparing the Charlize on screen, to her normal self, and you get caught up in the story, and really begin to believe that it's Aileen - it's almost like her spirit possessed Charlize. Not many actresses can pull that off.<br /><br />What was so noticable about Christina, apart from how utterly short she was next to Charlize (she's 5ft 1), was how young she looked. This was probably to make the difference between the two actresses as big as possible. And Christina's hair was dreadful! Absolutely dreadful! With only five years between the two actresses, it would have been difficult to make the beautiful actresses look as harsh as possible, to make a bigger comparison.<br /><br />I loved this movie, I was warned beforehand that I would probably hate it, but I didn't. I was fascinated by the entire movie, and was shocked, and was nearly in tears by the end of the movie. It never excuses the murders, or attempts to make them any less cold-blooded murders than they already were. Also shown is that Lee (her full name is never given in the movie) does have compassion - she never killed the stuttering virgin. The film is shown to be very bleak & sparse, and none of it was in the slightest OTT. Just a grittier, more realistic version of Thelma & Louise.<br /><br />Aileen's murder victims have been fictionlised to spare their families more grief & embarrassment. But they're still well-portrayed, especially the last John. You really felt for Aileen & him in the final moments.<br /><br />If you're a rather sensitive soul, and cross yourself every time someone swears, then you should avoid this movie. Aileen drops the F-word (and other related words) a mere 189 times. But her coarse language is absolutely necessary to the character. You can't imagine Aileen every being brought up to speak politely.<br /><br />This movie has definitely aroused my interest in Aileen, and I'm going on the hunt for her biography, which is no doubt out there somewhere. The movie & Charlize have to be seen to be believed, and afterwards, a lasting impression will be made on you. This is a movie that will never be forgotton.</p></body></html>

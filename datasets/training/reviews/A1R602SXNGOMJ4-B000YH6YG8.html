The movie centers around Derek, a man who has gone through experiences in his life that have led to him becoming an extremely hateful racist and anti-semitist. His father being shot by a black man is what sparks the change in him and his anger drives his life to a Neo-Nazi world that he ultimately ends when he murders two black men. His experiences in prison make him realize how much of his life he has wasted and his new goal in life is to save his brother from taking the same wrong path he did.</p></body></html>

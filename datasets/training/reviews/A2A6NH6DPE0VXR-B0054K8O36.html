<meta name="summary" content="A decent fantasy/adventure, but not the best of the series"></head><body><p>Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is back and now looking for the fountain of youth. Sparrow isn't alone on that journey though, because Black Beard (Ian McShane) and Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) are also looking for the fountain. Jack finds himself, a prisoner of Black Beard and the former love of his life Angelica Malon (Penelope Cruz), who just might be Black Beard's long lost daughter.<br />  Depp has already signed on for more sequels, that's how much he loves playing Jack Sparrow, but before he puts on the eye liner again, he needs a script that's worthy to him and the character. The last 2 sequels would have been better if they were a lot shorter and if the stories weren't so confusing with too many double crosses.<br />  On Stranger Tides has a story you can wrap your brain around and makes a good adventure/fantasy due to having zombies and dangerous mermaids and etc, but Jack Sparrow is too heroic this time around, which is pretty out of character. Despite being the main star, Sparrow also feels as if he's just on the outside looking in through a lot of the film as well. While Ian McShane, is well cast as Black Beard but is the weakest villain of the films due to being pretty under-used and not as threatening as Davy Jones or Barbosa.<br />  While the film would have felt more alive and memorable if the original director, Gore Verbinski came back. Rob Mashall tried hard with this film, but Verbinksi's films were at least great to look at with well shot sword fights and ship battles. After the first film blew me away, I never felt as if any of the sequels lived up to their potential though and On Stranger Tides is no exception. It kind of just floats along until it's time to get to the fountain of youth, so thank god it wasn't almost 3 hours. I really hope, they at least try harder to give us a film as good as the first with part 5.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good film"></head><body><p>This film has even inspired a political controversy, with Right Wing advocates claiming that the annual `monogamy' the male and female engage in supports their view that the nuclear family unit is ordained by God, and that Emperor penguins are proof of `Intelligent Design', even though they are clearly marvelous products of adaptive development. Gay rights activists have countered the Right's claims by noting that female penguins often steal the chicks of other females if theirs dies, and that lower animals do not feel human emotions like love, but merely act instinctively, sometimes engaging in same sex sexual play- which is not `homosexuality', which would imply that penguins are sexually turned on my male humans. Much of this misinterpretation of penguin behavior, as presented in this film, seeped over into the fawning critical reception of this film. Indeed, while the film is enjoyable, it is so only a Disney/Pixar level, for it almost plays out like one of those computer animated films, not a real nature documentary.<br />  Yes, the penguins suffer through conditions that would kill humans in seconds, seventy mile treks across ice, male and female sharing of the caring of the egg and chick, both of which would freeze if not for a warm parental pouch to crawl into, huddling for warmth in 125 mile per hour winds at -80? Fahrenheit, months of starvation, but these are not the makings of drama, because true drama requires conscious actors. Yet, many reviews of the film contain terms like `lovemaking', `bravery', and `fortitude', only further confusing the boundaries between fiction and reality, even as the film never focuses on an individual bird nor couple, the way most documentaries do, knowing that is the way to emotionally invest a viewer in a story. Instead, this film merely relies on the cuteness of the penguins, and especially their fuzzy chicks., who, by summertime, will be abandoned by both parents, and left to fend for themselves for four years, before they return again to their birthing grounds, to give birth to the next generation of their kind.<br />  Cinematographers Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison do get some incredible pictures, especially those underwater shots of agile female penguins swiftly trying to outswim a seal that's out to eat them, as they try to fatten up on small fish, squid, and krill, to bring back and feed their chicks. Yet, the Emperor penguins transcend this film's limitations. They are silly looking yet beautiful creatures: their black and white feathers are so densely packed they resemble the gloss on fine china, and the orange marks near their pates are so rich in color they dazzle in the blinding white of the ice, but the dull classical (or New Age?) musical score by Alex Wurman is one of the few aspects of the film that has rightly and universally been panned. Supposedly the original French version of the film had much more contemporary and apropos music by Emilie Simon.<br />  Regardless, while March Of The Penguins may be solid enjoyable kiddy fare, no adult should expect to be much enlightened, for the natural and documentary parts of this `nature documentary' seem to have been CG'd to death.

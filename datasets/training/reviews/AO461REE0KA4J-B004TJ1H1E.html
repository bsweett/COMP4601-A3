<meta name="summary" content="About the DVD version..."></head><body><p>To correct the technical info above, this DVD (both the special edition and movie-only edition) DOES HAVE an English monophonic soundtrack that was originally used in the film.  Also included is a Dolby Digital 5.1 track, but one wonders if a dialog-heavy film like this should really need a surround soundtrack.  Dialogs in both the mono and the 5.1 tracks sound perfectly clear and understable.  The surround sound only comes into use during the occasional music and gunfight sequences.  I do applaud the inclusion of the original mono track, which quite a few recent DVDs of older movies do not provide in the hope of enticing new DVD owners with 5.1 audio.<p>The video transfer looks great -- images are sharp, levels of black look realistic (you can clearly see and feel the velvety texture of a black robe Monroe wears), signs of wear and tear are virtually non-existent.  The picture aspect ratio is 1.66:1, which is not the 1:85:1 ratio used for the original US theatrical release and for all previous US letterboxed laserdisc releases.  The 1.66:1 ratio adds a little picture to the top, but doesn't really affect the composition.  The video is also non-anamorphic, so the resolution is not as high on a widescreen TV as it would be with an anamorphic DVD.  There is also no English optional subtitles, but there are yellow optional French and Spanish ones.<p>I would have gladly paid a higher price if they had included better supplementary material on the Special Edition DVD, such as the audio commentary and home movies that were put on the Criterion laserdisc made in the early 90s.  The extras on the Special Edition DVD include a lively but superficial 30-minute new interview with Tony Curtis reminiscing about the film, a rather uninteresting 12-minute interview with the actresses who played the girl band members, a segment called &quot;Virtual Hall of Memories&quot; that is essentially a still gallery, and trailers of 7 Wilder films including SOME LIKE IT HOT; all the trailers are in poor video condition.  The most interesting extra is a reproduction of a pressbook for the film, but the pictures are blurry and the smaller text is illegible.  I am disappointed that we never get to hear from Jack Lemmon or Billy Wilder, both still alive, on this DVD.  These extras are not impressive, so one may consider buying the movie-only edition for a cheaper price.</p></body></html>

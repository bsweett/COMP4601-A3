<meta name="summary" content="Americanized J-Horror But Better Than Grudge 2"></head><body><p>I felt that with the first grudge movie that at least it followed with the original Ju-on movie somewhat if you watch the first half of the movie follows Karen a caretaker for the mother of an american family in japan who have just moved into the cursed house and the family and what happens to them when the curse starts taking the family. After you see what happens to the family Karen finds out that strange things begin happening to her as she finds out what happened in the house with a previous family (Karen gets a little info from a police detective who was investigating to what happened to both families in the house) she tries to find a way to stop the curse.The first Grudge movie was decent (Definitely Way Better Than Grudge 2) but I say go for the japanese version Ju-On.A lot of people feel that Sarah Michelle Gellar was a great actress in this movie but after seeing her in this I couldn't wait for the grudge to take her out and I really cheered for what happens to her in Grudge 2.That being said for the price of the movie I say is 50/50 if you want good horror and effects this would be ok but if you want good actors and actresses my advice is to look elsewhere..</p></body></html>

From early successses like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000CQK0">The Man Who Knew Too Much</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780021967">The 39 Steps - Criterion Collection</a> to his later years masterpieces like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226055">Vertigo (Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IQEHI">North By Northwest</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225849">Psycho (Collector's Edition)</a>, Hitchcock is one of the most celebrated filmmakers in history.<br /><br />Rear Window is nothing short of a masterpiece.  A movie set in and around the front window of a man in a wheelchair.  This entire movie, from the shots inside and outside of the window, to the superb acting from James Stewart and Grace Kelly, to the use of only diegetic to set the mood.  A wonderful movie.<br /><br />One of the greatest of all times.<br /><br />Must Have.<br /><br />I also recommend: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002HOERG">Strangers on a Train (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CCW2U2">Marnie</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ECX0O2">Rope</a>.</p></body></html>

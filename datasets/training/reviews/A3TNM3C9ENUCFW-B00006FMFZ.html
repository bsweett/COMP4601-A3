<meta name="summary" content="Too Much Atmosphere - 2.5 Stars"></head><body><p>I don't know if this movie would have come across better in the theater, but I was more than a little disappointed after seeing several trailers and teasers before the movie.<br />Tom Hanks plays a professional &quot;Hitman&quot; and beloved &quot;right hand&quot; of Mobster boss, played (with more than a little panache) by Paul Newman, in the depression era. When his son stows away and witnesses Hanks making a &quot;hit&quot;, and unwittingly becomes an eye witness to Murder, Newman turns on him (Hanks) and sets out to murder his family for the sake of &quot;loose talk&quot; possibly leading to a police investigation. The director sadly, has spent so much time building this depressing, grey and rain soaked backdrop to the movie, that it actually precludes the story from really coming across. Even fans of this kind of dark and brooding mobster style film, will find it implausible for the most part, and even great cinematics cannot unfortunately save it. You the viewer end up frustrated waiting for the story to gather momentum, but it seems to just stagnate, and plod along until the end, which itself is not particularly noteworthy. At just under 2 hours in length, it's also a bit of a trial to endure, and I found myself clock watching on more than one occasion. I don't want to overcritize this picture too much, and Hanks fans will probably enjoy this step away from his usual material, but this is not in the league of the Godfather, or even The Untouchables, I'm sad to say.</p></body></html>

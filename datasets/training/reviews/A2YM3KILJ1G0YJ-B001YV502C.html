<meta name="summary" content="How much hope is necessary to remain hopeful?"></head><body><p>The reason most dystopian films fail is the lack of realism.  Whether a flying car or talking ape ruins credibility, there is always something unbelievable distracting the viewer.  In this film, however, there is enough familiarity with the picture of impending apocalypse - regardless of scientific likelihood - that it feels possible.<br /><br />The year is a believable 2027 (thanks to the subtle cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki), an expanded neon world in shambles, governments have collapsed, armed insurrection threatens anarchy.  As a result of harsh immigration policies, Britain serves as the desired destination...if one can get past the immigration camps (read: concentration camps), swarms of menacing guards with machine guns and dogs, and vicious bands of outsiders who have formed ad hoc societies to survive.  A credible global political climate exists where fringe groups war with an apathetic, if not conspiratorial government.  Making matters worse is the death of "baby Diego," humankind's youngest living person, which has shocked seemingly everyone except former activist Theo (Clive Owen).  Every bit the flawed hero, Theo apathetically drones through his alcohol and cigarette filled day of avoiding emotions.  Birth is now seemingly impossible - none for over 18 years - extinction is imminent.  Hope is lost.  Not until Theo is reunited with his ex-wife Julian (Juliane Moore), an underground militia leader whose organization is protecting Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey), the first pregnant woman in eighteen years, does he embrace the reluctant role of protecting humanity's last hope, thereby finding a purpose and possible salvation.<br /><br />Like McCarthy's "The Road," the power in the despair is the possibility.  In fact, this could very well be the precursor to McCarthy's vision; it's a world with a glimmer of hope, a dash of humanity, and a step removed from the complete chaos of a world with nearly feral humans.  While there is a definite gut punch in Children of Men, and similar themes of humanity's demise persist (e.g. famine, disease), it's not quite as hopeless as the starving, exhausting cross-country march in The Road for a single reason: birth causes hope to spring eternal.  True credit goes to Alfonso Cuaron for creating a world in which giving up may be the best answer, but holding onto hope is the likeliest choice.<br /><br />Acting-wise, Clive Owens truly comes into his own as a hero.  I've never quite felt the same way about a character he has portrayed, but the vulnerability of Theo made him appealing...especially when he went the second half of the movie in flip flops (don't ask).  The rest of the cast fills in their required gaps, with Pam Ferris acting like a renegade wet-nurse who remembers birthing before the baby drought, Chiwetel Ejiofor balances good and evil while desperately trying to fill the shoes being worn by Clive Owens, and Michael Caine gives the viewer a peek inside the chemically enhanced mind of an eternal optimist.<br /><br />By the time the second act breaks, this is a full-fledged, war-torn action (passable but not spectacular) movie and all that's left is watching to see if Theo will deliver Kee and her baby to safety.  Highly engrossing, highly recommended.</p></body></html>

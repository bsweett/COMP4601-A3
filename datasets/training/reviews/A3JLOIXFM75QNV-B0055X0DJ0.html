No. Michael Bay must certainly think his audience is incredibly stupid to have missed that ginormous plot hole. Oh, and apparently, robots can turn into perfect humans like in Terminator! Wow that is so amazing and believable!<br /><br />No seriously, Transformers 2 is pretty awful. It is 2.5 hours of explosions and super robots and pointless characters and no plot to speak of and a boring, predictable ending. And Megan Fox. Oh and clich&eacute;-ridden twin robots that spew profanities left and right. There is no point in properly reviewing this piece of garbage.<br /><br />I loved the first Transformers. It had the right balance of plot and action. Transformers 2 just doesn't know when to quit. Sad to think that all those millions of production dollars were utterly wasted.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Easily one of the great Westerns ever made"></head><body><p>There are moments in this film that are just about as perfect as anything as you will find in cinema, moments that display John Ford functioning at his highest level as a filmmaker.  For instance, there is a precious moment in which a woman is affectionately stroking the coat of her brother-in-law, who has just turned up after a long absence.  She is unaware that someone else, played by Ward Bond, can and at first does see her.  But the moment is far too personal, and Bond resolutely averts his eyes and refuses to see what ought not to be seen by anyone.  Another such instance is the final shot of the film (which I can't describe in detail without giving away the plot).  As the family retreats into the house, another character is framed outside the house (as if to exclude him), isolated from the family.  It is a heartbreaking shot.  The shot was also a homage to the late Harry Carey, in that the character in the frame holds his arm across his chest to hold the top of his opposite arm above the elbow, a gesture that anyone from that time period would associate with Carey.<p>This great John Ford film comes very close to being the greatest Western ever made.  In fact, with two slight alterations, it almost certainly would have been.  For some reason, Ford in some of his films suffered from unaccountable lapses in casting.  In this one, in the crucial role of Martin Pawley, he cast Jeffrey Hunter.  In many ways, Hunter mars the film with his often-grating performance.  One can only lament what the film could have been with someone like Montgomery Cliff in the same role.  The other odd decision was the elevation of Ken Curtis's role as Vera Miles other suitor.  Curtis, a former big band crooner who was later best known as "Festus" on GUNSMOKE, has several scenes that tend to bring down the overall quality of the film, especially a fight scene at a wedding with Jeffrey Hunter.<p>But these are aberrations in what is otherwise a masterpiece of the highest order.  I am not a big John Wayne fan, but Wayne was not just never better than he was in this film:  it is impossible to imagine anyone playing the central role of Ethan Edwards better than Wayne does.  He brings a grimness and tenacity and monomania that gives the movie much of its force and tension.  And although Hunter and Curtis both mar the film, most of the cast is spectacular.  Sometimes it seems as if Ward Bond were in every other film made in the thirties, forties, and fifties, but he was never better than he was in the role of Reverend Captain Samuel Johnson Clayton, both minister and police depending upon the need at the time.  And Hank Worden is memorable as "Old Mose," the more than a little crazed old fool who provides some of the films more memorable moments.  For instance, with the Rangers entrenched on one side of a river, bracing to meet an onrushing group of Indians, Mose suddenly shouts out, "Oh Lord, for what we are about to receive, we thank thee."  <p>They key to the film, however, apart from Ford, lies in the performance of John Wayne.  This is not the simplistic Indian killer or fighter you see in most of Wayne's films.  In this one, he is a man who has seen and suffered too much.  Ironically, he is chasing a rogue Indian chief named Scar, so-called because of a scar running down the side of his face.  But Ethan is far more scarred than the Indian is.  And as his hunt for Debbie, who has been abducted by Indians, turns from weeks into months into years, he correspondingly becomes more and more obsessed, to the point of near insanity.  Indeed, much of the tension of the last part of the film comes from the distrust of Ethan's sanity on the part of Martin (Jeffrey Hunter).  The scene where Ethan finally determines the fate of Debbie is one of the great moments in cinema.<p>This is just a great film by one of the great masters of the American cinema with the greatest performance by one of our most famous stars.  If that isn't enough to make someone unfamiliar with this film to see it, I don't know what would be.</p></body></html>

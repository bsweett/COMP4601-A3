<meta name="summary" content="The honor is not for sale !"></head><body><p>Do you imagine the awful scenes of what it meant the invassion of the German Panzers in Polland Sepember 1 1939 when the resistance fought ridden on horses?<br />Well , this was the impression i reminded on the last sequence of this film .<br />The Last Samurai is a brave film that reveals the significance of the honor in the Samurai culture .<br />The script is very related in conceptual approach to Dance with wolves in which nathan concerns . He is an antihero a man committed with nothing except himself . He is a haughty man . A mercenary without scruples who accidentally will discover a new world and will receive a slap in the facewhen he discovers the ancient traditions of this warriors .<br />The ideological conflict between the ancestral ways of life and the modernity tradition will become in the central nervous of the film .<br />Ken Watanabe perfomance is the most remarkable character of this film . Filmed as a Sumphony in four moments , retains its interest all along the film except the conclusion , its only fault .<br />Do you really expect that the hero presence after the battle is necesary ? Do you imagine a hero being interviewed , and telling his old memories for instance? Is the last goal of a warrior to be happy ?<br />This resolution final twists a wondeful film loaded with epic spirit .<br />But if you miss this little detail you will be rewarded by far with this picture .<br />Superb art direction and special effects .</p></body></html>

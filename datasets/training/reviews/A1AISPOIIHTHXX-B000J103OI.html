I decided to check this out simply because there was nothing else I haven't seen and I'm not a guy that shys around from "chick flicks", well obvious ones anyway. I remember it was just sitting on my counter as I watched other movies but then I thought I'm going to have to watch this sooner or later so I popped it in and surprisingly, while it does have some minor faults, I was actually surprised that it wasn't terrible but it was actually...good?<br /><br />It's a cutthroat world in the fashion industry where people are essentially worried about wearing the right clothes, being skinny and caring about material things. This of course makes Andy, (nickname for Andrea so it's not a guy), a smart but inexperienced and a size-6, a fish out of water at a fashion magazine, headed by Miranda Priestley, a nasty brutally honest woman, or just plain brutal. Andy needs the job to get ahead with her career so she has to suck it up and track down everything Miranda asks including skirts she didn't specify as to what kind, an unpublished Harry Potter book and knowing how to drop off things at her house without any problems.<br /><br />I remember working at a radio station where I was essentially tasked to do a few tasks that required a lot of time to finish them properly which of course meant by myself and not having any assistance or deadline extensions. Like Andy, I felt like way too much for just one person so I actually did started to feel sympathy but only thing was Anne Hathaway didn't really feel completely stressed out but more annoyed than anything. Whether it was bad casting or direction, I don't know. Of course the scene-stealer is Meryl Streep who plays probably the meanest thing I've seen. The other cast members are fine in their roles but in terms of characters, Andy's friends seem a bit underdeveloped. We're meant to see the job strain carry over with them but it doesn't feel as it should be.<br /><br />Ultimately though the film's about people's obsession and with that we get a look into people obsessing on clothing and must say, despite Anne's Hathaway's slightly ok performance, she looks quite radiant in the various dresses, including some shots where she switches dresses thanks to directing and editing and it's a good use of it. I find it hard though to accept Andy's reluctance to be Miranda's assistant since it's just simply her way of going about things. Miranda isn't really a devil so much as really difficult so despite my radio station similarity, my case and Andy's were simply unfair but a case of "that's the way the world works" so it was hard for me to feel empathy on that but just a I-know-how-you-feel thing.<br /><br />Unlike some chick flicks where it just oozes with cliche and bad comedic writing like people all of a sudden tripping or banging their heads, Prada feels more like the smart-women's comedy, it goes more for situation comedy rather than a go-for-broke approach. While the story is fairly predictable, it's at least an enjoyable romp that you might forget as easily as the latest trend. Call it the bell-bottoms of movies so to speak.</p></body></html>

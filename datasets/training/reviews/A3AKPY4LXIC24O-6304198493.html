What if you miss?&quot;"></head><body><p>Bryan Singer's artful direction of Christopher McQuarrie's ingenius  script, as well as perfect casting, make The Usual Suspects a film  impossible to forget.  David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) , an agent for U.S.  customs, has to find out why 27 people were massacred in Long Beach Harbor.  His only source of information, a crippled man, the only one to make it  out unscathed.  Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) procedes to tell his story of  five criminals who, after being somewhat wrongly accused of a crime, decide  to get back at the cops.  The success of their revenge leads to an even  bigger job, this time for the elusive and feared Keyser Soze.  A man each  character inadvertently crossed, the job is penance and appeasment to the  powerful mobster, a man no one is even sure exists.  Keaton (Gabriel Byrne)  is a cool headed professional, who insists that everything be thought out.  McManus (Stephen Baldwin) is a rash, quick to anger thug. Fenster (Benicio  Del Toro) ia a smart ass with a speech impediment.  Hockney (Kevin Pollack)  is a sarcastic, suspicious loner.  These four, plus Verbal Kint find out  that Keyser Soze is all too real, but who is he?  The last five minutes of  this movie will tell you just that as well as make you rethink the entire  film.  A must see movie, one of the best films of the 1990's.  The only  confusing part about this movie is how Kevin Spacey won a Best Supporting  Actor Oscar when he's in 90% of this movie, he should have won Best Actor!  Oh well.  &quot;And like that, he's gone.&quot;</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Texas border"></head><body><p>This is a film which combines the talents of a strange mix of actors.  I mean, you have 2 A Movie actors (Robert Deniro, Jessica Alba), 2 former A Movie actors (Steven Seagal, Jeff Fahey) and one thespian whose career is still in a sort of limbo (Lindsay Lohan).  Bring them all together and you have an ultra-fun, over-the-top B movie!<br /><br />The film centers around the rather sensitive topic of illegal immigration.  Namely, Mexicans illegally crossing the Rio Grande into Texas, and tempers tend to flare on both sides.  In the middle of it all is a hero (played by Danny Trejo) who prefers wielding a machete to a machine gun.<br /><br />Seagal's character seems to be more of a spoof than anything else.  It's Seagal's opportunity to portray just the type of thug that he relentlessly went after in his early movies (before his acting career dropped off the map).<br /><br />For those of you scoring at home, Lindsay Lohan does NOT appear topless in this film.  Sad to say, but a body double is in the film in place of her in the swimming pool scene.  Sorry ~ I'm just the messenger on this.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for a mostly mindless movie that has plenty of violence & a little bit of nudity sprinkled in, then this movie might be for you.  If you like movies where the ugly guy always gets the hot babe, then this film is a MUST!!</p></body></html>

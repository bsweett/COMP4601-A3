<meta name="summary" content="One Week Later"></head><body><p>One week later after watching this movie and I am still disappointed in it. Although I should have known it would be bad, because the first one was so freaking good. This movie, as other reviewers have pointed out, has too many points in it that I you are saying "no way that would happen" and you are too preoccupied about that to even care about what is happening on screen with the characters or plot. I didn't care about anyone surviving, because they were all idiots. The Father who kisses his obviously infected exposed wife, the two kids who sneak out to get photographs knowing that in time they would probably get them anyway, the soldiers and the doctor who have no common sense between them. I think I was harboring a secret fantasy that the little boy would get torn to shreds, because his behavior and downright stupidity made me frustrated. Who falls down stairs/escalators and just gets up and wanders off from there? Wouldn't you stay where you fell? The same "Godspeed you black emperor" song from the first movie, also made me mad, I guess they had to use it to tie it to the first, but to me it only reminded me how UNLIKE the first movie it really was! I actually snickered when the infected were running around France at the end, Le Rage Oui Oui!  I really want to one day take all the over acting infected shots and set them to music, maybe Barry Mani lows Copacabana?<br />I would say only see this movie, to appreciate how awesome the first one was all over again, and than go watch the first one to erase the memory of this sequel.</p></body></html>

It starts at the end, ends at the beginning, and throws in an unnatural amount of twists & turns throughout the duration. It's complicated, and it doesn't help that I was trying to work out the final twist, but I didn't. It was right there I should have done.<br /><br />The Prestige has an outstanding cast, including Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale (who I'm still not sure about as an actor), a short turn by Piper Perabo, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johannssen and a surprising appearance by David Bowie! Of all people! (He's looking old.)<br /><br />I have to say this movie kept me riveted throughout, but I just couldn't understand it. A big hand for all those who could. I just couldn't follow it. But why should a film about magicians/illusionists be straight forward?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Evil Dead II:  Dead by Dawn  (1987)"></head><body><p>Director:  Sam Raimi<br /><br />Cast:  Bruce Campbell, Sarah Berry, Dan Hicks, Kassie DePaiva, Ted Raimi, Denise Bixler, Richard Domeier, John Peaks, Lou Hancock.<br /><br />Running Time:  85 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for extreme violence, language, and nudity.<br /><br />Our hero Ash returns in this 1987 blood bath of a follow-up to "The Evil Dead". The king of slapstick horror does a bang up job of combining laughs and plenty of gore to create one of the most memorable and beloved horror sequels of all time. What some people may or may not know is, the movie, intended to be a sequel, was actually a revisited version of the first film. In this version, Ash (Bruce Campbell) returns to the dreaded cabin in the woods with only his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) and his infamous Oldsmobile. What was meant to be a quiet, relaxing get-a-way in the woods suddenly explodes into a bloody night of survival when Ash is forced to do battle with the evil that lies within the woods. Possessed trees, zombie mothers, and one demonic hand all set the stage for Ash as he risks life and limb (literally) to make it through the night. Joined later by Annie Knowby (Sarah Berry), the daughter of Professor Raymond Knowby (the man who unlocked the mysteries of the book of the dead), Ed Getly, (Richard Domeier), and two wanderers Bobby Joe (Kassie Depaiva) and Jake (Dan Hicks) Ash and his crew must survive the night, or be dead by dawn.<br /><br />Despite that fact that Sam Raimi is now a "proper" director making summer blockbusters like his life depended on it, it is still heartening to see that his frenzied style is still present in his work, albeit it not dealing with such extreme material as that which made his name famous decades ago. While Evil Dead II may be a complete repeat of Evil Dead in terms of the basic narrative and content, it is still worth seeing because of Raimi's skill as director and writer of the film.  Horror fans may find it a little tame by modern standards although I still found it to be pretty scary and gory - certainly considering it was made almost 20 years ago with a budget that would barely buy you an A-listed movie star these days. The film is also pretty funny and is full of dark humor and comic moments that make it more entertaining than a gory b-movie has any right being. But here's the thing, the success of this film and indeed the whole trilogy, is mainly due to two people - Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Raimi drives everything with his unique direction that places the action somewhere between a horror and a cartoon. It has great camera work, frantic shots and a real flair for the unreal; it is very hard to describe but it can be seen it many of his films.<br /><br />Campbell's ongoing cult status has only been helped recently by Bubba Ho-tep but this is where it basically began and part II only sees his continue his good work as Ash becomes more of a hero than he was in the first film. He still has the cowardly quality that I loved in Ash but now has weapons and kiss-off lines to compliment his new status. As before his performance perfectly matches Raimi's direction and I can totally understand why the two have kept their close relationship decades later; they really seem to "get" each other here. Support from Berry, Hicks, DePaiva, Domeier and Bixler is just about passable for this type of b-movie stuff but really the cast is dominated by Campbell playing his best character to date.  Overall, this is a gory, cheap horror movie that won't appeal to everybody but to those that get it, it will be a hugely enjoyable, gory film with a great sense of humor. Director Raimi and actor Campbell truly makes the film work better than the material would suggest it should and, on the basis of any of the three films, it is no wonder that this is such a timeless cult horror.</p></body></html>

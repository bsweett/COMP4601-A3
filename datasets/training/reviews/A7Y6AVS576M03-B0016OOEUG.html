If you have not seen the film I do not want to give the plot away. This is an intelligent mystery distinguished by witty dialogue, stylistic photography and production design and excellent acting. Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews and Vincent Price are perfectly cast. Preminger being more of the technician and perfectionist assembled all these talents to produce this genuine classic. David Raksin's theme is one of Hollywood's standards. Joseph LaShelle won an Oscar for his Black &amp; White Cinematography.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="fabulous effects, mediocre story, not watchable more than once"></head><body><p>As a fan of hard sci-fi, I am at a loss as to why so many current productions have great computer effects but the same banal plots (revolutionary against dystopia with special abilites to inflict violence, etc.).  I read reviews, buy them, and then feel so disappointed that I never want to view them again.  For the most part, while occasionally intrigued, I feel, "that's it?  They did this whole thing and THAT was all they had to offer?"  Unfortunately, this is one of those films:  the images are striking, the mystery fun, and then you get to the end and wonder how any producer could have imagined it would sell enough to recoup the investment.<br /><br />Not recommended.  I won't play the spoiler, but really, you are better off reading the comic book.</p></body></html>

I find the criticism that the story was stupid, laughable. It's a movie based on toy robots that transform. How much dumber could it get? This movie isn't about the story. It's not trying to win Oscars. Just sit down and enjoy it. I really think the people hating on this movie, and other movies like Wolverine, go into it looking for things to criticize. My advice to them is: If you don't want to like the movie, if you're going to hate it no matter what, don't see it!<br /><br />To every reasonable person, this was a great summer movie.</p></body></html>

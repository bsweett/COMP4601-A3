<meta name="summary" content="OK"></head><body><p>I'm not a fan of gangster movies, but this one seemed to have heart and was far from a "turkey."  It shows the bloodlust that mobs are suseptible to, a bloodlust that is like a fire you cannot put out, kind of like Iraq.<br /><br />Tom Hanks was spectacular and mob characters were very believable to me.  Paul Newman was also excellent as a mob boss.<br /><br />The mob mentality is a chilling one and it was portrayed well in this film.  Alittle too much killing, but very realistic.</p></body></html>

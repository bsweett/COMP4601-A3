It doesn't even struggle to its feet in order to at least end well. After a couple of tedious hours of the bad guy dragging about a cattle gun attached to a compressed air tank, the Coen brothers are so pleased with themselves, they decide to insult the audience with nothing more clever or novel than a blank screen ending. I was, however, relieved it was over.<br /><br />I understand the existential angst of the film. The Coen's do portray convincingly the aching despair, hopelessness, and helplessness of the human condition. They point to the gathering storm and darkness on the horizon. Unfortunately, this particular film does not illuminate.  I want to tell them that they got it wrong and it's okay; the end has been written; evil is vanquished and the prince of darkness loses.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing, but essential viewing for anybody who cares"></head><body><p>I was eager to see this film before it got released, simply by virtue of the fact that Edward Norton was going to star, and the extremely sensitive nature of the film (given it's subject matter).  <p>I wasn't disappointed--and it's easy to see why this film wasn't nominated for more academy awards (the politics of it made it impossible to win); we're admiring this film by the performances within.  Edward Furlong is negligible as always, but Beverly D'Angelo does an underrated turn as the Vinyards' widowed mother, and Steacy Keach (previously blackballed in Hollywood due to an earlier high-publicity cocaine bust) is very effective as the leader of the white supremacist organization.<p>The film is uncompromising in it's violence--some might say it's gratuitous or simply too visceral--but the choice to shoot its flashback scenes in black and white is brilliant, not just for the symbolism, but also for the starkness of each actor's performance.<p>Avery Brooks is himself; no more, no less, but that's fine, because Edward Norton is the real attraction of this film.  I wouldn't say it's his best performance, but it was certainly worthy of an academy award nomination.</p></body></html>

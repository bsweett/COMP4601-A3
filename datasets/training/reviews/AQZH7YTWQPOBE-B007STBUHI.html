I only recently saw it and have to say even after all these years it holds up extremely well. The movie creates compelling, realistic characters whom you actually find yourself caring about. This was (and is) a novelty for a horror movie. More importantly, the movie is subtle, partly be design and partly because of limitations in the special effects of the era. Viewers never really see the shark until the end of the movie, but the film does a brilliant job playing on the audience's suspense. Even when you know the shark is going to attack soon, you never quite know whom it's going to attack next. Overall, it's Spielberg at his finest and is a wonderful example of how a good script and careful editing can go a long way.</p></body></html>

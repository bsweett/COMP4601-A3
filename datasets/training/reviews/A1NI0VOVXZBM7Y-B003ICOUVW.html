<meta name="summary" content="The Wolf Man 2010"></head><body><p>I managed to see this movie thanks to a gift of tickets and I am thankful I did not pay,because If I did I would have given it 1 star!Wolf Man 2010 is typical Hollywood Remake. Lots of CGI And No Substance. And I knew since The time I heard it was coming and from the trailer this was going to be a snooze,but again, This was a gift so. Del Toro as the Lead Character Really? Only Sir Anthony Hopkins does a Half-Decent job. But My favorite character and the best actor in the movie is The Detective. The Movie gives you maybe one or two jumps, The Gore cannot even save it.<br />It's like a M. Night Shamalaya whatever his name is type movie but worst. Think Michael Bay makes a Horror movie or So-called horror. The Movie is long and for 2 or 3 scares, your better off Watching Wolfen,or An American Werewolf In London among some others that are way better and Scarier. 3 stars because I am being nice.</p></body></html>

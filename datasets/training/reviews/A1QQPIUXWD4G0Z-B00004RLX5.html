<meta name="summary" content="Another Great Star Trek Motion Picture Adventure"></head><body><p>As I explain in all of my Star Trek reviews, a good rule to remember with the Star Trek motion pictures is to watch only the even numbered ones (2, 4, and 6) and avoid the odd numbered ones (1, 3, and 5.) The even-numbered ones are extremely good while the odd ones (except for the first film which is rather average) are extremely bad. This continuation of Star Trek 2 and 3 directed by Leonard Nimoy himself is a pleasant viewing experience with a great screenplay, decent acting, and good special effects. A film worth owning or at least watching several times.<br /><br /> Our famous Federation crew starts on Vulcan where Spock has been re-educated in his Vulcan ways after coming back to life on the Genesis planet in Star Trek III. He was of course dispatched in Star Trek II while fighting Kahn. Deprived of the Enterprise, the crew takes off to Earth in their Klingon bird of prey but are interrupted by a mysterious space monolith that is disrupting the Earth's oceans. The Earth is on the verge of destruction and our heroes must go back to 20th century Earth to find the answer. Once on Earth, the crew is in total culture shock with their ancestors' primitive ways. Their mission is soon helped with the reserved guidance of a marine biologist (Catherine Hicks.) Will they come back to the Earth of the future in time to save humanity?<br /><br /> This plot is not the action-drama that pervades Star Trek II and VI. Instead, this is more of a science fiction-adventure-comedy with little to no dramatic tension at all. I wouldn't worry too much about the link with Star Trek III because it's simply better to avoid watching that horrible film and accept that Spock just came back to life. A very pleasant film to watch with plenty of comical cultural contrasts between future and past characters and situations; not to mention the perpetual clash of views between Spock and McCoy: &quot;You green-blooded inhuman.&quot; Leonard Nimoy directed this film quite well and the actors are comfortable in their roles. A fun film for the entire family.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Wizened Indy Comes Back to Form in a Rollicking, Overcrowded Adventure"></head><body><p>Truth be told, the latest Indiana Jones installment, nineteen years after the last, is fine, rollicking popcorn entertainment and not nearly the major disappointment some critics would lead you to believe. It may not compete with Iron Man in terms of story freshness or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UR9T8C">Spider-Man 3</a> for state-of-the-art CGI effects, but I never felt producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg had much more on their combined minds than updating the outrageous derring-do of the Saturday afternoon matinee serials of the 1930's and 40's. With the predominant use of traditional stunt work and pyrotechnics, the 2008 film represents old-fashioned escapism at its purest and falters only when the convoluted plot gets in the way, which is quite often, especially in the exposition-heavy first half. Fortunately, the veteran hands keep the high-spirited adventure afloat over its 123-minute running time, even though it never quite achieves the breathlessly excitement of the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>, an inevitable fate for all the sequels.<br /><br />Written by David Koepp (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAT">Jurassic Park</a>), the overcrowded story is set at the height of the Cold War in 1957, as the aging Jones finds himself captured by a group of Russian soldiers in legendary Area 51 out in the Nevada desert. Headed by Colonel Irina Spalko, a severely mannered doctor with psychic abilities, they force him to find a crate with the remains of an extraterrestrial inside (shades of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2IPP0">E.T.</a>). This leads to a terrifically energetic warehouse fight sequence that quickly reassures us that the filmmakers have not forgotten what the chief lure of the series is. Jones next manages to escape a nuclear test blast through creative means, at which point the movie calms down with the professor back at Marshall College. Forced to leave the university due to an FBI investigation, Jones meets a young motorcycle greaser named "Mutt" Williams, who tells him that his old colleague Harold Oxley is lost in the Peruvian jungle looking for the mysterious crystal skull.<br /><br />Once in Peru in the film's last hour, the action brings all the characters together, including Spalko and her soldiers, on a maddening chase for not only the skull but the secret temple from which it came. In the middle of the morass is Jones' old love and Mutt's mother, the still-feisty Marion Ravenwood. There's a wildly enjoyable chase scene on the edge of a steep cliff that has everything thrown in - a rapid-fire machine gun on a turret, fanciful swordplay, wine-swinging, aggressive howler monkeys, and an army of man-eating red ants. The last scenes bring the science fiction aspect into focus with Spielberg in familiar territory, and I have to admit that a lot of the climactic excitement is undercut by too many characters that are relatively incidental to the action at hand. Throughout the film, you'll see winking tributes to Lucas' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078322737X">American Graffiti</a> and Spielberg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ADD4">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>.<br /><br />At 65, Harrison Ford wears his age well, meeting the physical demands of the role head-on, and what comes across is a smart actor who innately understands the mythic qualities of his character while having fun with the outlandish situations he faces in quick succession. It's great to see Karen Allen, still with her wide, infectious smile, come back as Marion, but other than a few toss-off lines and her character's gutsy driving skills, she is given little to do this time. An actress as vibrant as Allen should be used for more than nostalgic purposes. As Spalko with her harsh Louise Brooks-style bob and using a bit of the Dietrich accent she used in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OY8NBK">The Good German</a>, Cate Blanchett is obviously having a good time playing a military dominatrix with equal parts Garbo in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009S4IJW">Ninotchka</a> and Natasha Fatale, Boris' taller half. My only complaint is that the filmmakers don't make Spalko evil enough to be truly as menacing as Blanchett could be.<br /><br />As the obvious successor to the series, Shia LeBeouf plays the cocksure "Mutt" as a young Brando wannabe (circa <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767818172">The Wild One</a>), but he lacks the genuine swagger and dangerous edge to make the character more than a plot device to attract younger viewers. Ray Winstone as the loyalty-shifting Mac, John Hurt as Oxley, and Jim Broadbent as Jones' fellow academic all play their smaller roles with their usual &eacute;lan, although I wish each one was given more opportunity to shine here. On the upside, John Williams' heroic music score is intact, and cinematographer Janusz Kami&ntilde;ski does a nice job succeeding Douglas Slocombe in picking up on the look of the previous films. The movie is just a little too busy to be a complete home run for the series, but it should satisfy long-time fans who have clamored for Indy's return. Judged from that perspective, it succeeds.</p></body></html>

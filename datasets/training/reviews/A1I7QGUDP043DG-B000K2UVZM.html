<meta name="summary" content="The Black Dahlia"></head><body><p>A top notch 'who-dun-it' filmed with an old style 'Noir' flavor, this movie has the spice of those great detective stories of yesteryear. The sexual tension is high, even while the body count is piling up. Two detectives who once moonlighted as boxers become obsessed with the brutal murder of a young woman aspiring to be an actress. The two men are desperate to find the reason for this senseless death, so much so that they let other brutal murders happening in the city take a back seat. Their search for the young brunette's killer leads them through a web of lies and to the doorstep of a filthy business conducted behind closed doors, yet right under the noses of those who should've figured it out but let emotions get in the way. The script is organized and pulls together well, tying up all the loose ends the way this type of movie should.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

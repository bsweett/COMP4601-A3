Not just as a great example of gay cinema done right, though it certainly is that. No, it stands on its own as a movie showing the portrait of a man who didn't intend to become political, wound up doing so, and ended up paying the ultimate price.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Milk and his boyfriend (James Franco), moving to San Francisco and promptly running into the kind of evil prejudice against gays that one would these days expect to see only at a CPAC meeting. This energizes and angers him to the point where he starts to get involved and begins his efforts to run for office. Initially his biggest enemies are the other prominent gays, but soon he's able to overcome and get elected, right in time to start a major fight with Anita Bryant and her crowd.<br /><br />Sadly his promising political career is cut short as another member of the San Francisco government guns down Milk and the mayor. He later plead not-guilty due to reasons of insanity, using the famous "Twinkie Defense", but it's pretty clear from what we see here that, no, he wasn't nuts; just another bigot who couldn't stand the gays and was really ticked when one of them, Milk, broke a political promise to him.<br /><br />Sean Penn gives the performance of his career as gay activist/politician Harvey Milk. He completely disappears into the role. At no point was I "aware" that I was just watching someone act, as often happens with films. No, he is extremely convincing and does an incredible job worthy of the Best Actor award he received for the role.<br /><br />The writing and directing are quite effective as well. This is the sort of movie that could've very quickly wound up being nothing more than a preachy screed in favor of gay rights, but thankfully it instead is something far more entertaining and interesting.<br /><br />Further I, as someone who is bisexual, gained new appreciation for the gay rights movement. I'm too young to remember what it was like during the 1970's for gays, but from this movie I now have an inkling, and I'm glad there were people like Milk who were around to fight against the monsters like Bryant and her bunch. Realistically the worse we face these days is fights over same-sex marriage, gay adoption and the right to serve in the military. What was fought for back then was a simple right to exist and this movie really brought home that point.</p></body></html>

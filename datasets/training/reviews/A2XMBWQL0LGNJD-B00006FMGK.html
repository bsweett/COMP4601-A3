<meta name="summary" content="The BEST Trek since Wrath of Khan!!!"></head><body><p>It's about friggin' time!  After 20 years and 7 mediocre films in the series, Trek FINALLY delivers the goods!  Undeniably the best of the Next Generation era films and arguable the best one since Khan,  Screenwriter John Logan and Director Stuart Baird are unequivocally the best thing to happen to Trek since Nicholas Meyer was brought into the fold.  The result is an entertaining installment that finally elevates the cast of TNG from the television series and solidifies their position to feature film status.  My biggest complaint of the post-classic Trek films is that they have always come off as 2 hour long episodes of the television series, and not even the best episodes of the show at that.  There have been much better episodes of the series that should have been made into theatrical films like "All Good Things" or "The Best of Both Worlds".  Until "Nemesis" came along, the Berman-era films have failed to distinguish themselves as theatrical contenders.<br /><br />Although the plot of Nemesis may seem a bit like a "clone" of Wrath of Khan, it definitely has the chemistry to make it an enjoyable and entertaining [copy].  For instance, the scene where a crippled Enterprise backs away from the Scimitar to escape the "Doomsday" weapon (see Genesis Device), you can practically hear the sinister Shinzon uttering "No Picard, you can't get away!"  The references to Khan are unmistakable, but scribe John Logan knows his audience and he knows exactly what they want to see and he knows these characters and injects the franchise with the right dosage of action and humor to resuscitate life into the dying franchise and keep the crew of the good ship Enterprise trekkin' a bit longer.<br /><br />As always, Patrick Stewart delivers a first class performance with Shakespearean benediction no matter how bland the script or dialogue may be.  Here, Picard has truly met his match in the form of a clone of himself.  This clone is younger and more agressive and mirrors his younger self in every flawed detail.  The whole time I kept thinking of the brilliant episode "Tapestry" where Q sends Jean-Luc back to change the mistakes of his past and we meet that arrogant and brash younger version.  Here, Shinzon is literally an example of Youth versus Wisdom and the themes are remakably explored between these two diametrical characters.  Khan he is not, but Tom Hardy delivers a diabolical performance as the calculating villain.  I still would like to have seen Shinzon complete the blood transfusion and jump 30 years in age in which we would have seen Patrick Stewart playing opposing roles against himself but perhaps that would have been too much like the classic Trek episode "The Enemy Within."<br /><br />The supporting cast are all present and (somewhat) accounted for.  Gates McFadden is basically "On Call" as Dr. Beverly Crusher making the house calls as needed.  As usual, Marina Sirtis as Deanna Troi serves basically one function, that of a psychic Ouija Board, but her engagement scene to William Riker was befitting.  Levar Burton once again holds the ship together as Chief Engineer Geordi LaForge delivering all of the technobabble and suffering from Scotty Syndrome.  As for the loveable Klingon warrior, Mr. Worf, it seems Michael Dorn is unfairly given the smallest part to play in this film.  During the film's climax, he seems to disappear from sight while Jonathan Frakes' Potsy-looking (see Anson Williams from Happy Days) Riker is manhandling the Reman Viceroy (Ron Pearlman) down a laundry chute while Jean-Luc Picard is fighting with (himself) and the Enterprise is taking a pummeling.  One must assume that either Worf is still too hung over from the Romulan Ale served at Riker and Troi's reception, or that he must be curled up in Ten Forward lounge with a bottle of Saurian Brandy getting drunk with Guinan.  I find it amusing that he only shows up again at the end for the free booze in the Captain's Ready Room during the toast to "absent friends."  I'm surprised that they didn't cut back to Worf during the corridor firefight with the Reman thugs.  I would love to have seen him break out the Bat'Leh and take them out in honorable Klingon fashion as it would have provided another element of suspense.<br /><br />Brent Spiner reprises his role as the charming android Data and once again explores his humanity through the presence of a doppleganger brother in the form of the childlike B4.  This could have been the perfect opportunity to bring back his evil brother Lore had they not written him out on the show.  Perhaps B4 was designed with the intention of giving Spiner an oportunity to explore new facets of his character having reached a redundant impasse with the development of his role Data.<br /><br />It is a shame that it took them 4 films with this exceptional cast before everything finally clicked on what may be the last film to feature the TNG crew although the door has been left open for possibly another voyage.  If they can continue with this level of dramatic intensity then by all means "Make It So."  And if they do decide to make another, I would love to see them bring back John DeLancie as Q.</p></body></html>

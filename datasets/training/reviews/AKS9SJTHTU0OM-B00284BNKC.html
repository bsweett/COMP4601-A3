<meta name="summary" content="Flawed, but thrilling film-making"></head><body><p>Amazing on a purely cinematic level - assaultive, hyper-kinetic, full<br />of breathtaking images and cuts, The performances too range from good<br />(Jared Leto) to extraordinary (Ellen Burstyn).<br /><br />But for me, after a while, the style becomes the substance, and I'm<br />ever more aware of the filmmaking rather than the story and characters,<br /><br />Also, other than 'drugs are bad', I'm not sure what Aronofsky is really<br />getting at. There are interesting implications that our real addiction<br />is to our dreams, and escaping whatever our reality is, but those<br />themes are never fully played out. So we end up with a film made with<br />the technical skill of a Scorsese or Kubrick, but missing a layer of<br />depth in favor of (admittedly amazing) pyrotechnics.<br /><br />Last, it feels like the film 'cheats' more on reality as it goes along.<br />By the end the story twists start to join the style in being over the<br />top, and a bit illogical.<br /><br />Now, all that carping aside, I still recommend this film for it's<br />bravery, performances, and technical virtuosity. And it grew on me on a<br />2nd viewing. And I'm a fan of Aronofsky's. But I'm in the minority in<br />admiring this film, but not being able to completely embrace it.</p></body></html>

All of them are like this.  Stupid, long and boring.  They have so much potential (as does she), but never amount to anything good.<br /><br />The only saving light in this movie was Mark Ruffalo (who is so unbelievably gorgeous and cute and funny).<br /><br />Jennifer sets out to prove whether or not her family was the inspiration for The Graduate.  Along the way, I almost fell asleep.  I didn't love this and it's not a romantic comedy, but a romantic flop.  Look out for a brief and desperate cameo by Christopher McDonald, and also look out for the odd laugh provided by Shirley MacLaine.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm sorry to say that there weren't too many good spots here and I was very disappointed.  This doesn't give me much hope for The Breakup, because I can see right away it is going to be as terrible as this.  Aniston doesn't provide much star power to me anymore.  I think she should go back to TV sitcoms.</p></body></html>

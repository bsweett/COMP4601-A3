<meta name="summary" content="slow-paced Swedish kid vampire flick"></head><body><p>That's an accurate description.  It is for adults but it features kids, one of whom is a vampire.  You should listen to it in Swedish and read the English subtitles, since the English dubbing is horrible.<br /><br />The film is very slow paced as well, so you will have to endure that or else hit the FF button on your remote.<br /><br />The swimming pool scene towards the end is probably the most chilling scene.<br /><br />Where is Oskar headed at the end?</p></body></html>

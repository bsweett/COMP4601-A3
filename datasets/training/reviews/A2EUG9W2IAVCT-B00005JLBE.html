The opening credits and special effects are brilliant, as well as the fitting song "Die Another Day" performed by Madonna.  Halle Berry is, of course, a babe as evident from her first scene opener.  The plotline is solid and the acting is humorous but never cheesy.  Overall, a thoroughly entertaining film.</p></body></html>

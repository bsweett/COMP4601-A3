But this one is just too pat, too predictable, to deserve paying theatre prices to see.<br /><br /> Basic plot: Willis is a cop who is living a rather routine life as a police chief, having become emotionally shut off after a botched hostage situation. Now he has a chance to redeem himself by saving one family taken hostage -  while also trying to keep his own family out of danger from other bad guys.<br /><br />  If you watch every action film that comes along, good or bad, you'll probably go to this one. But it isn't even close to the level of Willis's best work. Too bad he didn't get a script worth working with. He tries hard but even the best actor can't rise above a mediocre plot.</p></body></html>

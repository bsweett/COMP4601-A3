Sideways is one of the few movies based on a book that improves a good deal over its source material. And it is absolutely hilarious. The reason I like Sideways, for better or for worse, is I know both Jack and Miles too well. At one time or another, I've walked in both of their shoes. Alexander Payne reaches a zenith of sorts with his quiet eccentric style. The film blends friendship, the road trip and a party flick. The wine provides an interesting tenor to boot. Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church are completely irreplaceable in their respective roles. They're sort of cosmopolitan R2D2 and C3P0 roadies.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray<br /><br />There's been a lot of complaints over perceived Blu-Ray quality over the standard DVD.  I can tell you, the Blu-Ray is better.  On a large 1080p screen, there is a noticeable difference.  Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael created a unique look for the visuals to give the film a signature feel.  All those smudgy light plumes, and glowing highlights come from diffusion and slight overexposure folks, maybe even a shot of digital grading to punch the highlights.  None of those things lend themselves to the sharpest end products - the end product is a vintage style soft image.  The Blu-Ray IS indeed better. There is no way i would choose the DVD over this. If you don't have a big enough 1080p screen for it to matter, however, the DVD will probably suffice.  But come on, at $10 for the BD, why choose the DVD?</p></body></html>

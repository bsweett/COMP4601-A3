<meta name="summary" content="Not your run-of-the-mill horror film"></head><body><p>Certainly not your run-of-the-mill horror film, "Splice" tends to fall into the thinking man's sci-fi/horror hybrid ala "Moon" as another recent example.  It's not really all that scary especially when you've already seen the trailers and know what's going on.  It can also be compared as a modern day "Frankenstein" where scientists mess with Mother Nature.<br /><br />In general I liked the movie.  However the film creates this interesting creature but focuses too much on the external elements of that act rather than on how she/he might evolve.  Still, you have to like it for some technically excellent filmmaking and a different sort of thriller.<br /><br />The Blu ray is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and transferred in 1080p.  The film has a full range of color but the muted browns and indoor shots look particularly good if a bit soft.  The audio includes DTS-HD MA 5.1.  It is clear and concise even with the quiet scenes.  The LFE channel doesn't have much activity.</p></body></html>

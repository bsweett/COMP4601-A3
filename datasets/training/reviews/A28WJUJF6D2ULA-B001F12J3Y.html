<meta name="summary" content="Missed Chance To Be A Classic"></head><body><p>This frantically manic madcap would-be disaster epic was not what I expected or wanted The Polar Express to be, and was definitely not what it should have been. I'd go so far as to say this was not all that good of a movie, despite its novel animation and occasional visual brilliance. What frustrates me here is how great this movie could have been and should have been. There is only the slightest connection between this movie and the plot of the much better short book that goes by the same name. Also would it have killed the filmmakers to have stuck with the characters from the book as written and drawn instead of turning this beloved classic into some sort of misguided effort at furthering "diversity" in America? Just a very disappointing film from every aspect.</p></body></html>

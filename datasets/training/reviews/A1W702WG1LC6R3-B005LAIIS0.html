<meta name="summary" content=""Good Thriller!""></head><body><p>Liam Neeson stars in this 2011 thriller. After being in a plane crash,<br />A group of men try to survive the wilderness against hungry wolves.<br />Liam is great as usual and this dvd has nice picture and sound, but<br />only commentary and deleted scenes. I recommend this good thriller.</p></body></html>

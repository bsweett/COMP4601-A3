<meta name="summary" content=""Alien Nation" By Way Of "Cry Freedom""></head><body><p>Johannesburg, The Present: The Alien ship drifted into a lazy orbit over Johannesburg twenty years ago. When humanity finally cut their way inside, they found roughly one million malnourished, unhealthy insect-like Aliens dwelling within. The Aliens - derogatorily nicknamed "Prawns" - were relocated into a single huge refugee camp in Johannesburg known as "District Nine". Despite an apparent instinctual affinity for technology, the Prawns are generally considered to be of low intelligence and have been marginalised, castigated, brutalised and left to die by a largely intolerant human population which treats them with suspicion, disgust and xenophobia. With Alien/Human tensions running at an all-time high, it is decided that the Prawns should be evicted from District 9, which has degenerated into a gigantic slum of shacks, poverty and crime over twenty years, and relocated to a new district far outside the city.  MNU, a private corporation which has thus far been unable to exploit the fruits of the alien technology, is contracted to enforce the eviction and do so with their usual brutal efficiency not realising that the ruthlessness of their conduct will have devastating consequences for both human and alien alike...<br /><br />As one would expect, the spectre of South Africa's Apartheid years haunt virtually every frame of Neill Blomkamp's "District Nine". If you are old enough to remember the horrors of that era, you can only marvel at the bravery of Blomkamp's film; partially shot in nascent semi-documentary style, I felt an old familiar sickness in my stomach as I watched Afrikaans bureaucrats - backed up by armed bully-boys - cheerfully going about the systematic eviction of oppressed and marginalised 'pariahs' from slum-dwellings whilst throwing jocular asides such as "The Prawn does not really understand the concept of ownership, so evicting him is no great problem, hey?". The poignancy of these scenes is all the more potent when one considers that they were shot on the outskirts of Johannesburg's Soweto township (which witnessed just exactly this kind of state endorsed barbarism during the Apartheid years).<br /><br />That said, there is much more to Neill Blomkamp's film than just polemic. It is a brilliantly paced action thriller, with a very dark comic streak, which puts virtually everything made by Hollywood in recent years to shame. After watching it, I was unsurprised to discover in the extras that this project was green-lit following the collapse of producer Peter Jackson's movie of the "Halo" video game. Indeed, the final sequences of the film - which, despite some awesome action, for my money were the weakest - do actually resemble the action sequences from a particularly bloody first person shooter, so one wonders whether any of the production design was carried over from the aborted film.<br /><br />In terms of acting, performances for the most part are brilliant, convincing and improvisatory. Praise must go to Sharlto Copley for his turn as 'Wikus', an MNU bureaucrat who finds himself reluctantly thrust into the very heart of alien/human tensions. He makes one of the most unusual leading men of recent years (think David Brent from "The Office" cross-pollinated with an action hero and you're getting close). This really is a film which is carried as much as by its acting as its special effects.<br /><br />"District Nine", along with the likes of the similarly brilliant <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T9H2MO">Moon</a> and "Daybreakers" almost seems to be part of a new renaissance in thoughtful, philosophical independent science fiction film-making (and proof that the smartest movie-making really does seem to be completely removed from Hollywood, these days).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Top Gun with Samuri Swords"></head><body><p>This film started out interesting and good,and then just became "Top Gun".While interesting historically,this film lacked everything else,and just followed the  basic "Hollywood" formula.It was also unrealistic to believe Tom Cruise's character(a troubled,raging alcoholic) could learn the art&skill of a Samuri Worrior in just a few short months of time.The film followed all the basic plot outlines of Top Gun,just like "Days of Thunder",and I was rolling my eyes towards the end.It sounds great on a home theater system,but this is'nt one I'd want to buy&keep forever.Buy&own at your own risk,but there are better Jappanese Samuri films out there like "The Seven Samuri".</p></body></html>

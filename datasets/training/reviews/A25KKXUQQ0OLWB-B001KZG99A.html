Jon Favreau directs with a verve that doesn't forget people as he keeps the super hero format intact.  Robert Downey plays Iron Man with a great sense of humor and as Tony Stark the weapons magnate who is his alter ego.  The movie begins in Afghanistan and Tony Stark is held hostage and escapes by making a protective suit to ward off deadly weapons.  He perfects this suit into the Iron Man we know and love in the movie.  Pepper Pots is a great servant and a very pretty woman whom he ignores as often as he can.  Terrence Howard gets to play the sidekick in a fun way.  Jeff Bridges finally gets a bad guy role.  What fun!</p></body></html>

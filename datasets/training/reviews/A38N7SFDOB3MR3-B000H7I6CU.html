<meta name="summary" content="Original and Heart Warming. 90 out of 100"></head><body><p>After seeing so many children's movies with animals lately (Hoodwinked, Over the Hedge, Ice Age 2, etc.) Cars was a needed change. It was wonderful sitting down to a movie that offered something a bit different. Don't get me wrong, our family loves movies with goofy animals. But after laughing at and with Tow Mater for 2 hours, I was so glad I didn't see a silly squirrel in the whole movie. Tow Mater was awesome. We all hope to see Tow starring in his own flick! Bring on the sequel!!!<br /><br />With that said, Cars is a heart warming story of a race car called Lightning McQueen who is full of himself. Lightning stumbles off the beaten path of life, and onto the backroads of route 66. There, Lightning McQueen finds all the things he was missing in life because of his self-absorption: friends, beauty, and love.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly suprised with the story. Yes, Cars had many, many funny parts (especially the tractor tipping, and Tow Mater), but the story itself is what shines like a diamond. Cars is a movie that will have you leaving the theatre changed, looking for love, beauty and cherishing what you have. I can't give a movie any greater compliment than this. A must see, and must own children's movie.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 90<br /><br />43 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />8 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br /><br />10 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br /><br />9 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br /><br />10 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br /><br />8 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?<br /><br />Plus 2 extra bonus points for Tow Mater! Tow is a one one a kind children's movie character that will not soon be forgotten.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Inside the mind of a paranoid schitzophrenic"></head><body><p>This is truly an original !<br />If you are not interested in a deep character study, and especially in psychology, then you will probably be dissapointed in this movie.<br />If you are, however interested in the workings of the mind of someone with a mental illness, then you will probably be intrigued by this movie.<br /><br />It starts out with Ashley Judd, a lonely unhappy woman who has had more than her share of tragedy in life. She has a recently paroled husband who terrorizes her, and years earlier, her 7 year old son was abducted,which the guilt from that alone was probably what made her give up on life.<br /><br />Anyway, her co-worker introduces her to a drifter, who she becomes quickly attached to.<br /> The role she plays is so sad. She is so lonely, that she overlooks this new guy's quirky personality, and becomes totally convinced that he was part of an experiment while in the service, and was injected with bugs.These egg sacs are supposed to be growing and hatching in him and he uses self-mutilation to remove them.<br /><br />She, too becomes convinced that she is infected and starts digging at herself.<br />From here, the level of paranoia and insanity the two of them go through will make you want to SCREAM !!<br />At one point in the movie when he begins pulling out his teeth with pliers...you just MUST turn away.<br />And what he finds here under the microscope, had me thinking "IS he really crazy?"<br /><br />And the longer she is with him, she begins to be just as bad as him, or even worse in her delusions...up to the point that the whole room is literally COVERED in foil.<br /><br />I know, I know!! - I am giving away a lot here, but as deep as this mind trip goes, it really is only a small part I gave away, and I only did that to peak some interest in this story (which I think is EXCELLENT) because of all the bad reviews it got.<br /><br />I say, give it a chance! It's truly original, interesting, intense, and CREEPY!!! And the end will totally leave you in shock !<br />I give it 5-plus stars.</p></body></html>

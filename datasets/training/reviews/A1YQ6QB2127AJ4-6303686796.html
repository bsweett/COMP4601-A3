<meta name="summary" content="Psychotically Amazing"></head><body><p>&quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, directed by Martin Scorcese, is a great psychotic and dark film about a man, Travis, who suffers from insomnia and begins his job as a taxi driver.  As he begins developing more psychotic thoughts, the plot becomes more interesting.  The several twists and turns keep audiences' eyes wide open for every second.  The grizzly streets of New York City offer a closer, more interesting look into every event.  Such dark theme makes this film ahead of its time; in fact, some may say it's also ahead of our time.  The multiple storylines keep the plot interesting the whole time, namely a woman, Betsy, he's obsessed with and a twelve-year-old prostitute, Iris (nickname &quot;Easy&quot;), that he wants to help.  This leads to a powerful conclusion.  The presented quality deserved its four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture of 1976.<p>The actors add their own powerful psychotic theme to &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;.  Robert De Niro plays Travis delightfully.  His every expression is flawless.  Jodie Foster plays Iris beautifully as her character's pain and yearning are expressed to the fullest.  She proves that she was one of the best child actors from the 1970's.  This role is great for audiences to watch to see how she's become the genius actress she is.  All other actors also performed their roles wonderfull, namely Cybill Shephard, Harvey Keitel, and Peter Boyle.<p>&quot;Taxi Driver&quot; is a great film for audiences looking for a unique drama.  Its dark theme will never be forgotten by any viewer.  This will surely continue to be a classic for many more years.</p></body></html>

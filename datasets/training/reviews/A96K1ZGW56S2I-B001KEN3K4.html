<meta name="summary" content="True To the Spirit of the Original Series"></head><body><p>GET SMART is a television show that comedy fans hold in high regard.  Don Adams as Maxwell Smart was the perfect combination between bumbling Mel Brooks-goofiness and high security intelligence.  There have been a lot of television shows that have been made into movies (and vice versa).  Many of these are terrible.  From much of the press at the time of the movies release, one might think that the film adaptation of GET SMART starring Steve Carrell is a disaster, but it's not.  Instead, the movie stays fairly close to the original series, especially in spirit.<br /><br />In the movie, Maxwell Smart has been working for CONTROL for a number of years and longs to be a field agent like his role model, Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson).  When CONTROL headquarters is attacked, it becomes clear that the organization has been infiltrated by KAOS and that someone is a traitor working for the other side.  Most of the field agents who weren't killed in the attack are pulled and given desk jobs and Max finally gets his promotion as he's assigned to the field as Agent 86.  He's partnered with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), who because of recent plastic surgery remains in the field since no one knows what she looks like now.  Before leaving for the field, Max is given some top secret gizmos from his two research and development friends Bruce (Masi Oka) and Lloyd (Nate Torrence).<br /><br />Carrell and Hathaway give fine performances. They are both talented actors and there really is some zany chemistry between them on screen.  Dwayne Johnson steals many of the scenes he is in playing up to while at the same time spoofing the macho leading man roles he often is given.<br />Bill Murray has a very small cameo as Agent 13, so watch for that.  Also, many of the original devices and gags from the original series feature in the movie such as the cone of silence and the shoe-phone.<br /><br />I enjoyed GET SMART.  I thought it was funny, with just the right amount of action and plenty of heart.  Though it's not quite as good as the original tv show, it as a great film adaptation of an original tv show that only misses the mark "by that much".</p></body></html>

It's funny that Leterrier's film was supposed to have its visual effects stand as its greatest strength when as it turns out some of his action scenes, and more specifically the interactions between CGI monsters and normal characters, are about as seamless as Harryhausen's outdated efforts, which were themselves outgunned by George Lucas and others thirty years ago.  Harryhausen's work was probably deemed most eye-popping almost sixty years ago (i.e.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001W9GA">The 7th Voyage of Sinbad</a>).  Yes, there are some state of the art effects happening but they are handled by subpar imaginations and creativity that is definitely more miss than hit, and I mean that commentary to apply further to the costumes, sets, and make-up threefold.  The make-up is bad, the concepts are trite and at times over-stylized, and the hair!  Oh my goodness, the hair.  It seems that every alpha warrior of Argos has three hours to strategically place mud on themselves, apply eye-liner, and create extravagant cornrows and dreadlock-like mullet extensions.  And if you think I'm only going to be critical of this movie's visual flaws, keep reading.<br /><br />First, let's summarize.  The film follows a family of fisherman with the usual British accents who stumble upon a demi-god baby named Perseus (Sam Worthington).  As the story unfolds and the gods get really mad at people for thinking they are cooler than the gods, Perseus gets mad enough to allow his rage and taste for vengeance drive him toward going after the oh-so evil god of Hades and his vile sea creature titan, the Kraken.  But in order to do that he needs Medusa's head, and in order to get that he needs to talk to these batty old blind witches, and in order to do that he needs to fight a whole bunch of gigantic scorpions.  Along the way he also better start liking and praying to his god daddy so he can use a flying horse and his fancy but kind of ancient-looking lightsaber.  He's got to save Andromeda (played meaninglessly by Alexa Davalos) and maybe even at the end of the story Zeus will be kind of enough to grant him a lovely sex slave in Io (played yummy-ly by Gemma Arterton).<br /><br />Worthington's acting can be described as kind of like Russell Crowe in that really intense scene in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NU2CY4">Gladiator</a> when Maximus reveals himself to Commodus in the arena, only Worthington talks like that all the time and it never ever changes, not even for a second.  Liam Neeson (Zeus) hams it up and Ralph Fiennes (Hades) makes Neeson's performance look comparably very serious.  Polly Walker (Casseopiea) recycles her role as Atia in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028RXXE8">HBO's Rome</a> but strictly in the most superficial sense, because she was wasted and her role, like many here, was merely part of the set.  Danny Huston (Poseidon) was completely wasted.  The rest of the cast came off as a bunch of awkward live action role-players gathered together right from their LARPing event as starstruck extras, but they were instead given speaking parts.  Even worse than that was a character who I can't seem to find a name for anywhere.  He was a priest of sorts who looked to worship Hades and sacrifice Andromeda.  He delivers truly some of the worst acting I've seen in a very very long time.<br /><br />The acting is an easy target and so is the writing.  Many will forgive these things but I will not, so keep that in mind.  The writing in scenes with less action is unbearable and the screenplay is lazy, even for a remake of a film with a lazy screenplay to begin with.  Still, I'm really being hard on this film when it did have some brights spots that are incredibly memorable and show-off the amazing CGI without being too gratuitous.  To say the film doesn't go way overboard at times with its effects is an understatement.  Instead of coming out of a cage deep in the ocean the Kraken is released after the entire ocean floor breaks open.  His exit from the water is indeed remarkable but you know that already if you've seen the commercials; it's just a longer version of that.  The Pegasus is beautiful too and the horse they had was great.  The real work with the horse combined with the very believable CGI in his scenes were seamless and very enjoyable.  However, the best scene in the movie has been kept pretty well from the public and that is of course Medusa.  Instead of the ugly stop-motion snake lady slithering quietly in the memorable gothic horror-like scene from the original 1981 movie, we get a beautiful face within a mane of snakes and a fast-moving gorgon that petrifies her enemies in by far the most keenly edited footage the film has to offer.  That scene by itself might be worth the price of admission to many but it still doesn't quite capture the charm of the original stop-motion Medusa.<br /><br />This isn't an inspired movie but for the most part it doesn't deviate from the spirit of the original, for better or worse.  It even makes one very well placed inside joke to lovers of the original film, but that scene's charm is quickly snuffed out by alarming and unintentional irony.  If I was twelve that would've gone over my head and this movie gets 4 out of 5 stars, but I'm not twelve. One more thing, the 3-D adds virtually nothing to this film as an experience seeing in a theater, unless you count wearing dark glasses for two hours.  Wait for DVD or blu-ray.</p></body></html>

Freddy as you recall was so bad in that first nightmare film that he sliced himself and the green ooze coming from his slashed ribcage looked like road kill warmed over. And Jason? He would suffer the most terrible destruction only to revive, a hulking murder savant, hockey masked so his victims would never get a hint of how machetes fatal strike will come. This movie seemed to deconstruct and mock alla that precursor mythology about the two and go to the basic horror fan's geek argument, "If Jason and Freddy got into a fight who will win?" It's reminescent of those "Who will win a fight between the Hulk and Thing?" from the Marvel Comics microcosm....so, the movies writer's and producer culled up the premise...Jason becomes Freddy murdering slave, cause he's (Freddy) infected him (Jason) in his dreams (as if he has them)...throw in some late teens and early twenties kids who's more interested in TRL than urban lore and you get the set up. The body count adds up, but and all along the way you get some mind bending slash contests between the two majors. And teen aged deaths as art. What can I say but I thoroughly enjoy it. It ain't spozed to be Chekov, but a way to kill time on a Sat afternoon. It keeps you watching...Loved the way no one wanted to give Jason the mouth to mouth. Loved the way the myths and mystique are designed to go one forever. It is a two digits up (chopped off???) slash fest.</p></body></html>

Weeks before the movie opened, the League sent out numerous letters and E-mails that asked people to boycott the film. If there is a lesson to be learned in all this, it is a reminder that we shouldn't judge things sight unseen. Dogma certainly pokes much fun at the Catholic church as an institution, but ultimately it is one of the more spiritual movies of the last decade. It's main fault is its tendency to delve into theological questions that many non-Catholics will not understand. It is much less insidious that the recent End of Days, which had homicidal Catholic priests running around preaching mumbo-jumbo. <p>It seems that a few thousand years ago, a couple of angels named Bartleby and Loki [Ben Affleck and Matt Damon] got tossed out of Heaven for refusing to do their jobs. They were banished to Wisconsin, where they still reside toady. In New Jersey, a hip archbishop is trying to make the church less stodgy and more appealing. The banished angels discover that when the archbishop rededicates a cathedral there, a portal will open which will allow them to go back to Heaven. All will be forgiven. There is a little problem with their doing this. When they go through the portal, it will prove that God can be wrong and is, therefore, fallible. Since everything is predicated on the Almighty's being always right, their reentry will cause the universe to cease to exist. Bartleby and Loki are willing to risk this. Anything to get out of the Midwest, I presume.<p>Things are about to change dramatically for Bethany Sloane [Linda Fiorentino], a reasonably well adjusted young woman who works at an abortion clinic. She's definately a lapsed Catholic. One night a fiery angel called Metatron [Alan Rickman] appears at the foot of her bed. She tries to put him out with a fire extinguisher, only to find it's really hard to get rid of a persistent immortal. He wisks her off in her night clothes to a Mexican restaurant, where he informs her that she is The Chosen One, the one charged with preventing Bartleby and Loki's passing through the portal. He tells her she will be aided by two prophets, who soon appear as two spaced out drifters. These guys may be carrying a message, but they certainly don't know it. Soon the trio, aided by Rufus, who claims he was the thirteenth apostle, are hurrying towards their date with destiny. Along the way, they are threatened by Loki and Bartleby, as well as Azarael [Jason lee], an avenging angel with an attitude. <p>Frankly, any attempt to explain the plot makes the whole thing seem somewhat sacrilegious. The movie isn't that at all. Dogma can be defined as a doctrine concerning faith or morals authoritatively proclaimed by a church, and the picture is much more faithful to the dogma of the Catholic church than almost any film I have seen. I can only imagine that what caused such a stir about the movie is that it is a comedy. And a very funny one, at that. I still contend that, if the Church is ever actually damaged by movies, the harm is done by 'serious' psycho-babble dramas like The Omen and The Exorcist. That's because such fare, while highly entertaining, tends to portray Catholics as superstitious and as very vulnerable to any whim Satan may have. Satan isn't even around in Dogma, a movie which, if it does anything at all, promotes spirituality, albeit with a smirk, a grin and a multitude of profanities.</p></body></html>

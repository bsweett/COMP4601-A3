<meta name="summary" content="An excellent sci-fi thriller"></head><body><p>&quot;Total Recall,&quot; directed by Paul Verhoeven, is a stunning blend of high-concept science fiction, action, and humor. The script is based on the story &quot;We Can Remember It For You Wholesale,&quot; by legendary science fiction writer Philip K. Dick.<p>In the film, an Earthman named Quaid (a good performance by Arnold Schwarzeneggar) goes to have artificial memories of an exciting vacation to Mars implanted into his brain. But the process goes horribly wrong, and Quaid ends up on Mars in the midst of conspiracy and unrest.<p>&quot;Total Recall&quot; contains truly amazing special effects. Combined with the set design and some memorable mutant makeup designs, this is one of the most visually stunning science fiction films ever made. There is plenty of humor in the film, often in the form of snappy one-liners and weird sight gags. The performances are very good; I was especially impressed by Ronny Cox as the ruthless Martian dictator. And everything is well complemented by the big, booming orchestral score by Jerry Goldsmith.<p>The intense violence may turn off some viewers. But if you have a high tolerance for cinematic brutality, give &quot;Total Recall&quot; a try. It's a witty, inventive, and visually impressive achievement in science fiction filmmaking.</p></body></html>

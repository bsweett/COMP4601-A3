Critics seem to love everything he does. I guess he must be a tremendous filmmaker. I really don't see it. Everything in his films is played down to the point of just being boring. Although this film has some great acting, it's no exception.<br /><br />Although the film is interesting, and the acting is great, the plot is a bit diluted and seems forced at times. Basically, Don Johnston (Murray) receives an unsigned letter from an ex-girlfriend telling him that the son he never knew he had is coming to find him. He receives this letter as his current girlfriend is leaving him.<br /><br />This leads his best friend Winston into wanting to play detective and sends Johnston to visit each of his old girlfriends to look for clues as to who could have sent the letter.<br /><br />Each woman's character is remarkable and they provide the high points of the movie. And although Bill Murray is even more sedate than he was in Lost In Translation, it works. The whole thing is very realistic. Sometimes to the point of being realistically boring.<br /><br />Some things in the film are cliche and some are surprising. For example, having a teenage daughter named Lolita is cliche. Having her parade naked through the living room with a stranger in the house is surprising. Surprises like that help keep the movie from being utterly tiresome, but Broken Flowers still manages to stay pretty uneventful throughout.<br /><br />On the DVD there's a special feature where Jim Jarmusch talks about his creative process and how creatively creative he can be. Basically, you get to hear him loving to hear himself talk while weird shots of a barn are shown in the background.</p></body></html>

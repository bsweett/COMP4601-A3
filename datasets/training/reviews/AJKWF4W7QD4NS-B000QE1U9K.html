<meta name="summary" content="How the Alien saga was nearly ruined"></head><body><p>David Fincher, the man who would later be responsible for Seven and Fight Club (two movies that are strongly recommended), directed this third installment of the Alien saga (which was supposed to be the last one).  Fincher lends what would become his trademark stylistic direction, but that alone can't save this film.  The first time I saw this I said to myself the series should have ended with Aliens.  Alien 3 takes everything built upon in the first two films and throws them out the window, and trust me thats not good.  Its played out like a horror/slasher movie, waiting to prepare yourself for the next big shock, instead of being an intelligent action/sci-fi hybrid we were used to before.  There's nothing but a lot of running, screaming, and cursing as the new (and poorly designed) &quot;dog&quot; alien hunts down Ripley and the prisoners.  Not to mention complete logic is disposed of, if you want to know what I mean read Jeff Bollen's review, and one of my biggest complaints is after all 2 and a half plus hours of Aliens where Ripley fought to keep Newt and Hicks alive, they are both dispatched at the beginning of the movie.  Alien Resurrection would follow later on, and would try to breathe new life into the series, but Alien 3 remains a landmark at how to ruin a good thing.</p></body></html>

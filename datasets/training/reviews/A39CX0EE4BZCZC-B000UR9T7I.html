<meta name="summary" content="A Fun Movie & Spectacular On Blu-Ray"></head><body><p>I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the "best" and especially on this Blu-Ray disc, which looks spectacular. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining and not just because of the sharp transfer.  It's a fun film.<br /><br />Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc.<br /><br /> Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.<br /><br />Myself, I thought "The Sandman" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!<br /><br />This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, revenge is more fun - no doubt......but never as satisfying.<br /><br />For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.</p></body></html>

If you are a fan of "When Harry Met Sally", "Sleepless in Seattle", then, you probably know what to expect on this one.  To make a subtle comedy romantic movie isn't easy because the storyline has got to be good, the cast needs to have chemistry, their comic timing has got to be impeccable, and the scripts need to be tight. I have to say that other than minor glitches, this movie simply breezes through.  What other reviewers said about underutilising Frances McDormand, Keanu Reeves, Amanda Peet is true but what bothers me more is that whilst all efforts are made to ensure that Jack's and Diane's characters are as wholesome as possible, Keanu's character seems to be a cookie cutter character with a rather two dimension perspective.  Whilst the ending is what all dreamers like you and I are wanting, right in the snowy night in Paris, and that they all live happily ever after, I find it too formulaic and too good to be true.  Still, the journey heading to the final destination is such a joy to watch.  There are elements in this movie that reminds me fondly of "The Producers" which is now to be converted into a movie medium.  I find the DVD great with two versions of commentary, one with the main cast and the other with the Director and Producer who are covering the dryer and technical aspect of the movie.  The commentary of the cast commenting upon some of their funnier moments in the making of the movie is hillarious and funny for its own sake.  Well, don't miss this one like I did.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

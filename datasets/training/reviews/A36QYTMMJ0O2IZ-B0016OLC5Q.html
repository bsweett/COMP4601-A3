<meta name="summary" content="An Epic Spiritual Journey of the Human Spirit Through the Freedom of Simplicity"></head><body><p>This may be one of the best films that I have seen in the last few years, and Sean Penn may well have directed his masterpiece in this incredibly moving and powerful true story of a young man who seeks him Self in an epic journey.<br /><br />Chris McCandless is a young man who has just graduated from college.  He has nearly $25,000 in savings.  His family is hoping he will use it toward a Harvard education.  Instead, he does the unthinkable: he gives all but a few hundred to charity, sets off on a trek around the country and eventually burns the last bit of money that he has left.  Crazy?  Perhaps...to us, anyway.<br /><br />"Life begins OUTSIDE of your comfort zone" --Conversations With God. This quote applies to Chris because he's chosen not play life "safe." He wants to live, and to engage in new experiences often means taking risks. From the start of his journey, Chris does this nearly every day.<br /><br />The journey of Chris "Alexander Supertramp" McCandless is one of the most powerful journeys of man: it is the journey of letting go.  He decides to return to a state of simplicity by removing virtually all of his worldly possessions and attachments, except for the basic necessities.  He does not wish to be bogged down by conformity and the hypocrisy of human relationships any longer, and so he leaves his family and everything he knows behind.<br /><br />The irony of letting go is that it is tantamount with healing and with Self discovery.  Chris meets a number of people throughout his journey.  They all seem to be touched by this simple and yet wise young man who brings with him a powerful, healing energy whether those he interacts with are aware of it or not.<br /><br />Perhaps the most touching meeting of all, is the last one shown with Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook in an especially sweet performance) as an old man living in the Anza-Borrego desert of Southern California.  Chris challenges Ron to not give up on life and new experiences just because he's old, and to not give in to the illusion that human relationships are the principle form of happiness.  We see the sparkle of realization in Ron's eyes as the truth sinks in.  Ron is so taken with Chris that he wants to adopt him.  Chris simply tells him that they can talk about it when he returns from Alaska.  It's at this point that Ron realizes that Chris belongs to no one except himself even though he knows that Chris, indeed, loves him.  Chris knows that a truly loving relationship is about letting go, not holding on, and it's evident that this is the only type of relationship that he has with each and every person he meets and comes across.<br /><br />Chris is like a modern day Thoreau (which ironically he read a lot of including Tolstoy, London, and other writers).  He goes into the wilds of Alaska to live deliberately and simply in order to gain further insight and wisdom as to who he is and what life is really all about.  It is no surprise that when he finally passes away, it is with a smile on his face because he knows that he has truly lived.<br /><br />The performance of Emile Hirsch is a fantastic one.  He plays the role simply, much like how the real Chris McCandless must have been.  It's as if he understands what it must have been like to know Chris and he incorporates that knowledge into the role.<br /><br />Jena Malone (as Chris's sister) is equally important as she narrates and chronicles the life of her brother.  She seems to be the only one who truly understood him and why he did what he did, regardless of the fact that she had to heal herself from the loss of her brother.<br /><br />Chris died at the age of 23, and yet I would submit that most people have not lived the happy life that he lived at twice his age.  He truly lived the life he wanted to have.<br /><br />One thing that I found most profound was even though he was helping many people whom he came across on his journey, Chris was always provided for whether it be a pair of boots, a beat up cowboy hat, or some old fishing gear and machete.  Is this not what all of the sacred writings talk about?<br /><br />This is an experience to be treasured, and this film should be required viewing for nearly everyone.  Because through Chris's journey, we might stop and reflect on our own journeys.  Are we living our lives to the fullest?  Are we happening to life or is life happening to us?  Are we happy?  Chris found his answers, and hopefully, we will all find ours since we are all on our own spiritual journey.</p></body></html>

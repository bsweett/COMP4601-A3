<meta name="summary" content="Black September"></head><body><p>Director Steven Spielberg has brought to life the tragic events of September, 1972, when Palestinian terrorists abducted and eventually killed the members of the Israeli Olympic team who were competing at the Summer Olympic Games in Munich, Germany.<br /><br />Infuriated by the murders and seeking revenge, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) approved the development of a special team of assassins who's job it would be to track down the Palestinians who were responsible for the killings and assassinate them. The team consisted of Avner (Eric Bana), Steve (Daniel Craig), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), Hans (Hanns Zischler) and Carl (Ciaran Hinds).  These men were stripped of their identities, and, if caught, they were on their own.  Israel did not know them.  Their job was to track down the Palestinians throughout the world, excluding Arab countries, and eliminate them.<br /><br />Working with a secret agency run by Louis (Mathieu Amalric) and his father, the team is provided with pictures and the whereabouts of the Palestinians.  Soon, the group springs into action and the killings begin.  However, it does not come without cost to the Israelis.  Avner, who left his pregnant wife in Israel, is beginning to wonder about the true purpose of his mission, while the others, including Hans and Carl, meet their own demise.  In the end, Avner begins to suspect that Louis' agency may have been providing information on him and his group to the Palestinians, although this was never revealed to be true.  Avner's team succeeded in eliminated six of the eleven Palestinians, along with a female Dutch assassin who was suspected to be working with the Palestinians. Eventually, nine of the eleven Palestinians were elimated.  Two survived.<br /><br />As for Avner, he and his family moved to Brooklyn, but he still had constant nightmares about his part in the assassinations.<br /><br />This is a spectacular film.  The historical authenticity is perfect, and I especially thought the original ABC Sports broadcasts from the 1972 Olympics covering the kidnappings were one of the highlights of the movie.  Jack McKay and his co-anchors did a yeoman job of keeping the world informed about the crisis.  I can remember as a young child watching these events unfold on television, and I'm glad Steven Spielberg chose to incorporate them into the film.  The kidnapping scenes are especially shocking, while the scenes with Golda Meir and her advisors show her true resolve to avenge the athletes' deaths.<br /><br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The story of Avner's team is brought to life, and, although there were actually several Israeli teams looking for the Palestinians, the viewer gets a first-hand account of what it was like for these determined men to avenge their countrymen's deaths.  The acting is excellent, and, of course, the directing and production is top-notch.  Its easy to see why this movie was nominated for five Academy Awards.  Watch this masterpiece of a film and experience what it was like for those few tense days in September of 1972.</p></body></html>

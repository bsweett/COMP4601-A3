Well, kinda. I don't mind but they're have been serious troubling ones but thankfully, The New World isn't one of them. It's just too bad the actual film isn't that good. It's handsomely made but not as inviting as the film makes itself out to be.<br /><br />We know the story: native american girl Pocahontas falls in love with English settle John Smith. The Englishmen see the other side as savages while the natives see the other side as barbarians who take what they want with little regard for anything. So a love story in the middle of this isn't going to help.<br /><br />The film is of course quite nice to look at: trees standing, trees in the wind, still rivers, rushing rivers etc. But there's the problem since they're seems to be too much of it. Wanting to create a certain mood, the film is littered with images that seem fit to be in wildlife documentaries. They're nice but they're not that important but sure enough we get em in droves. The film is also rather slow. Characters rarely speak and even if they do, it's rather brief at times.<br /><br />Well the visuals hold up, despite their excessiveness, so how's the acting? Well, not quite good either. Colin Farrell, who's often been labelled the next best thing, pretty much as the same expression on his face the entire time: like he's come back from a funeral, all solemn and sad looking. Q'Orianka Filcher is of course the real find and hope we see more since she has a gravitas and a youthfulness that you can't help but notice. Christian Bale would've been a good character but since he literally drops in 1/2 hour before the movie's over, they don't develop him the way they should've.<br /><br />Is it well-made? Of course. The cinematography and the art direction values are through the roof. As a film though? It's extremely disappointing.</p></body></html>

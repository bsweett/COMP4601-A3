Edward Norton and Jessica Biel were fantastic as Eisenheim and Sophie!!! Paul Giamatti was really good as the city's chief inspector. Even Rufus Sewell was good as the ambitious crown prince. It all begins, when Eisenheim and Sophie begin seeing each other when they were children. However, they forced to end it, when Sophie's family fines out. Eisenheim disappers for a couple of years. But, he returns as the most celebrate illusionist in all of  Vienna. After a chance encounter at one of his shows. Eisenhein meets up with Sophie again and learns of her impending marrige to the crown prince. (Who has a very bad reputation of treating his ladies, poorly). He also learns that crown prince isn't too popular with the Vienna government. Eisenheim realizes that not only Sophie could be grave danger, but he must stop a mad man from reaching power. So, Eisenheim faces his greatest challenge ever. To come up with an illusion, that can save Sophie and stop the prince at the same time.</p></body></html>

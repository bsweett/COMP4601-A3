So when I heard about Van Helsing I was pretty excited. I did enjoy the Mummy movies for what they were, that is I enjoyed the Indiana Jones aspect of the films, and when I found out Sommers was in charge of Van Helsing I expected more of the same. There were elements to Van Helsing that I really liked. The Van Helsing character resembled a turn of the century James Bond who instead of tackling SPECTRE, hunted down evil. The Wolfman scenes of Van Helsing packed the biggest punch of the movie, which may have been one of the bigger problems with the film overall, seeing as how the Wolfman was a secondary character. Mr. Hyde's cameo was fun, as were Dracula's brides. But I am not a big fan of CGI special effects. I don't see the difference between CGI and a guy in a rubber suit or make-up. Sure you might see the zipper on the rubber suit, but no matter how convincing the CGI is, you can't help but notice that the monster is basically a cartoon. The biggest downfall for Van Helsing to me was Dracula and Frankenstein though. After years of associating Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff with the roles, Dracula in the film came off as a pretty weak character, one without much menace. The Frankenstein monster seemed almost helpless in the film, and came off as whiny. This movie reminded me a good deal of Sean Connery's "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen". The idea looks good on paper, but for some reason just doesn't click. This movie is just some harmless fun, entertaining while on, but forgotten by the time the end credits finish rolling. Van Helsing isn't the worst movie I've seen involving Universal's monster collection, but it is far from the best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An enjoyable "historic" action-adventure"></head><body><p>Orlando Bloom packs on the pounds and muscle to play a 12th century blacksmith turned Crusader turned baron in this strong "historical" action-adventure.<br /><br />The action moves quickly from France to the Middle East, where the tale becomes a parable on the endless futility of Middle Eastern conflict. Despite a few "ripped from today's headlines" speeches, the action is well-done, the military conflict interesting and there are strong performances all around. The climactic battle at the Christopher Gate of Jerusalem, if it doesn't quite measure up to similar siege sequences in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies, is exciting and involving, even if the populism seems a few centuries early.<br /><br />Great fun with a more rounded story than the more intense Gladiator.<br /><br />Strongly recommended for fans of getting medieval.</p></body></html>

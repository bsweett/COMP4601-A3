<meta name="summary" content="CHICAGO really is worth 'all of that jazz' and a big bag of popcorn......"></head><body><p>I must toast director Rob Marshall with a tall glass of champagne (I don't even drink, so this should speak volumes to you why I would break my rule!).  He definitely brought a seamlessly successful broadway musical to the "big screen" with smooth grace.  Though, this process was anything but easy, according to the TV show I distinctively recall on Broadway that divulged all kinds of juicy tidbits about production (particularly the great "blood, sweat and tears" efforts Richard Gere took in fine tuning his tap dance routine--Gere was previously not known for his dance, partly because he hadn't really formally had to put into practice in a film before.  He went on to showcase his flair for movement in the American remake of SHALL WE DANCE, with Jennifer Lopez.)  Catherine Zeta-Jones had musical theater in her blood, and came by her singing and dancing with ease and grace (and never looked lovelier accepting that well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, as Velma Hart in this film, right before she was scheduled to give birth to her baby!).  Renee Zellwegger had minimal "formal" training in dancing, but made improvements in leaps and bounds (no pun intended), which is made evident in the numbers where she appears as a soloist, as well as her duets with Catherine Zeta-Jones.<br /><br />I know I haven't spent much time discussing the plot, but, in all honesty, it is pretty convoluted and I would only ruin the experience of watching the film for you!  I will say that is set during the age of the "Roaring Twenties," and oh boy, did they (rightfully) have something to howl about, back then.  The intrigues associated with fleeting celebrity are examined closely and at their most visceral.  Roxie Hart (Renee Zellwegger) is the "up and coming" singer/dancer who just can't get that big break, and is never really what anyone is looking for. While Velma Hart (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is the sultry star with the fashionable bob that no one can get enough of.  It isn't until a swift turn of fate (well, that and the sound of a gun going off!) that brings these two women together....in a prison, of all things....Okay, that is where I will stop.  No more plot details required, believe me.  What I will add on to this review, before I close, is just how wonderful the score is by Ebb & Kander.  Songs like "All That Jazz" are featured here.  You know, those great toe-tapping hits that you frequently associate with some of the greatest works of the late choreographer Bob Fosse (who orchestrated some really hot numbers for the original Broadway production, with his wife Gwen Verdon, who was the original Roxie Hart, along with Chita Rivera, who played a fiery Velma).  There is a reason that CHICAGO received an Academy Award for Best Picture of 2002.  You'll love this film, in all of its saucy and enchanting glory.</p></body></html>

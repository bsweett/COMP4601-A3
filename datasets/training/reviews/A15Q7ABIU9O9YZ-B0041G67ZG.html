<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant stars, less than brilliant script"></head><body><p>Pollack is a wonderful director, isn't he? I enjoy his body of work immensely and the Three Days of the Condor film, now 30 + years old, remains in the top 3 or 4 of the 'Hitchcockian character up against the evil empire' movies. And the evil empire ain't the Russians!<br /><br />I don't think the Interpreter compares favorably to Condor, for argument's sake, and while Kidman and Penn surely hold their own against Dunnaway and Redford, I think the script was if not weak, confused.<br /><br />First of all, that these two characters, Silvia the interpreter (Kidman) and Keller the Secret Service Agent (Penn) are damaged goods make them so much more interesting. They are superior actors and they strut their stuff well. And that Pollack doesn't take the easy way out and get them into bed shows great retstraint and a powerful sense of human caring as opposed to that other thing.<br /><br />But she was an armed rebel in a foreign country. Her family was murdered by one of the member nations of the United Nations. Do we really think she's going to get a job passing extraordinary scrutiny to be within reaching distance of the 191 most important people in the world?<br /><br />And he's married to a (and I certainly don't mean to denigrate the profession) a stripper, I believe, who finds other men, has passionate affairs with them, leaves Sean and then comes back. Time after time. Over and over. This time, 10-14 days ago, she's in a drunken accident and dies. Now Sean Penn (Tobin Keller) is the guy who guards the President. Do we think he can pass a High School psychological test much less one for the Secret Service?<br /><br />So ill fated people meeting eachother is a good start to a good mystery - thriller. It's just hard to believe it's going to happen in the UN.<br /><br />Kidman gets more beautiful and gifted with each film. Sean Penn is everything Deniro and Pacino had 30 years ago. The guy is great. The two of them carry the movie gratefully beyond the limits of the script. Pollack's film direction is always good. It just seemed as though the movie was in place before the decision was made as to where they wanted the script to take them. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

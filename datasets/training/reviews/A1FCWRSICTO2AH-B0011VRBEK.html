<meta name="summary" content="A Very Good "Boy""></head><body><p>What a ride!  "Oldboy," has been labeled a revenge flick - which it certainly is.  It also has all the classic trappings of Noir, which may elevate things a bit, since such careful attention to noir elements reflects a careful construction behind the carnage.  Of course, you couldn't tell that from watching the first twenty minutes or so - which is humorous and completely different in tone when contrasted with what follows.  Still, if you watch carefully, the seeds of the story, and the fate of Oh Dae-Su (the movie's anti-hero), are all there.  The movie's "secret" or mystery really isn't that big of a secret, and if you've watched noir flicks at all or have read your Jim Thompson, the characters' fates are not such a surprise. Shocking -- always, no matter how many times you've seen or read it, but not a surprise.  But I'm not revealing anything more here.<br /><br />The movie has loads of style (which is probably what attracted Tarantino's interest), and the story unfolds nicely - in a very pulpish way, while Oh Dae-Su, the whole time offers up pithy existential nuggets of hard won wisdom.  The movie starts out almost as a comedy, turns surreal (Salvador Dali weird) as Oh Dae-Su is mysteriously imprisoned for fifteen years.  Then it shifts gears into grindhouse action, and closes with a Sergio Leone like flourish - operatic, over the top and totally cool.  Probably the only movie I've seen that believably shows a man fighting 15 others - with a hammer.  It was like the Thriller from Manilla - kung fu version. Grueling. Brutal. A must see flick.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A LOST SOUL SELLS BIG GUNS"></head><body><p>Andrew Niccol directs Nic Cage as weapons of mass destruction salesman Yuri Orlov who sells ordinance like the medieval church sold indulgences; spare us your morality, please, for church and Yuri, it's only about money.<br /><br />Very dark humor pervades this shocking story of the personal and professional life of a Ukranian man who is in the business of supplying weapons to any country or rebel that can afford them.  For a while his beautiful wife (Bridget Moynahan) is clueless and his drug-addled little brother is a poor choice as a partner.  Amoral and frightening, this glimpse of the black-market gun trade is only bearable by the slight peek of Yuri as a human being and not the monster he has almost completely become.  This is one of Cage's better roles.  Cage seems to understands how the relentless drive for success can kill the last vestiges of a lost humanity.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A very good film with a noxious ethos"></head><body><p>I have not read the Cormac McCarthy novel on which this movie is based, so I can't use that to assess the movie.  In any case, two or three hour feature films are necessarily very different than three hundred page novels.<br /><br />This is a very violent film, but the violence is more the fabric of the film than the point of it.  I have to say that when the film ended the way it did, I was somewhat ticked off.  Then, as I thought about the title, the opening narration, and the ending, I was able to see an interpretation of the film where this ending makes a lot of sense.  Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom Bell opens expressing a difficulty with the modern world where crime isn't an aberration, but far too normal.  At one point in the film, Bell has a poignant conversation with an old family friend, Ellis, who is now confined to a wheel chair after being wounded in the line of duty.  They talk about the decadence of the time, and this note is touched on again and again.  While, I could go on for pages about this, I think one point is that law enforcement is meant to clean up the spills and messes that occur in a largely orderly and moral society.  However, when the spills turn into floods of immorality, drugs, murder, greed, and thievery, well, the lawmen of the former age, the old men, realize this is no longer a country in which they can do their old job. In fact, it is a world in which the very idea of law has become an anachronism.<br /><br />The central focus of evil in the film is a character with all the pity, humanity, and warmth of a Great White Shark, Anton Chigurh (a wonderfully chilling portrayal by Javier Bardem).  This creature (hardly a man) moves through society seeking after something as an excuse to prey on humanity as if each person were no more than animals coming to his slaughterhouse.  During the film he is after a couple of million dollars Stephen Root's nameless businessman invested in a drug deal gone bad.  It was first stolen and then found by Llewelyn Moss (well portrayed by Josh Brolin) as he was out hunting for food.  Moss and his wife, Karla Jean (Kelly MacDonald give a very fine performance), are very poor and live in a run down trailer.  Moss thinks he is tougher and more aware of what he needs to do than he really is.  Frankly, he is quite good in the near term tactics of a situation, but can't see the larger forces working around him, and this is where he makes his serious mistakes.<br /><br />So, Sheriff Bell is trying to find Chigurh, becomes aware of Moss and tries to help him and his wife, Roots nameless business man is trying to recover his money, and a group of Mexicans want the money they think is theirs because it is associated with the bad drug deal.  Root hires Carson Wells (nicely done by Woody Harrelson), a bounty hunter, to get his money and stop Chigurh.  Wells is confident, even overconfident, he can do both and is quite talented at what he does.<br /><br />But the plot, and I will leave the rest for you to work out, is really only the thing that ties all the wonderful conversations together.  Short or long, it is the people talking together about all this disaster happening around them that makes the film so worthwhile.  Yes, the film is harsh and grim, but the goodness of Bell and his associates almost redeems things.  I don't share McCarthy's and the Coen Brothers despondent view of the world and, in the end, I reject the film's ethos.  Still, there are many many worse films to see.  It is far better than "There Will Be Blood" to compare it to one of its contemporaries.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI</p></body></html>

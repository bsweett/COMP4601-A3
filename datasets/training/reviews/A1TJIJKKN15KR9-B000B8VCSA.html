With the premise set completely by the first movie, Supremacy is free to quit worrying about the setup and dive right into the action and weighty plot developments. Though I noted several scenes that were more than coincidentally similar to the original, they were each amped up a couple notches and paired with enough original material to retain a unique identity (no pun intended). The story does a fine job of picking up on the dangling threads of the original and wrapping them all up into a rewarding, conclusive finale. There was a bit too much shaky-cam in the action scenes for my liking, but this was in theaters when the concept was still fresh and it does lend a slightly more believable look and feel than you'll get from the classic polished Hollywood fights.</p></body></html>

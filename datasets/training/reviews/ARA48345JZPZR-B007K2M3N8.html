And Kevin wanted to make a movie about him all his life so he could show-off his impression of Darin and get a chance to sing on film.  So somehow he got someone to finance this vanity piece and he got it made.  Good for him.<br /><br />But as a viewer, should I find that reason enough to applaud the effort?  Maybe if it had been better.  Maybe if someone approaching Darin's youth had starred.  Maybe if Darin's life had been more interesting.<br /><br />Let's face it, Darin's life is a subject for interest because it was cut short. I liked Bobby Darin.  He was a gifted musician and a good singer.  He wrote a couple of good songs.  He was an average actor (his Oscar nomination for a supporting role aside...the Academy did that all the time, especially back then).  Fame came to him early, and without a lot of pain.  He got rich quickly, married a movie star, and even by this loving account, was a petulant, self-absorbed ego-maniac.  He didn't adjust easily to the changing times and struggled to stay relevant.  And before anyone could make a judgement about where he was going or what he would or could become, he died.  Sadly.<br /><br />I sympathize with the effects Rheumatic fever had on his life, I had a beloved cousin that died young because of that.  But Darin's illness allowed his pursuit of music and his gifts gave him a charmed, albeit short, life.<br /><br />As many have pointed out, Kevin Spacey is too old to play the part and there is no getting around that.  Especially when he is playing opposite the very young Kate Bosworth, who doesn't have much to do here by the way.  He got cute with the scenario doing the film within a film bit and so on, but basically, beyond singing the famous tunes, there isn't a lot to work with here, and all the flash and glitter can't cover up the lack of story. He had one shocking relevation later in his life, but it is dramatically flat, and all I felt was the way I felt when he was whining over losing the Oscar....get over it!<br /><br />It was mis-cast, especially in the title role, it was too cute by half in its structure, and it was much ado about very little as far as I was concerned.  So, if you want to spend a couple of hours indulging Kevin's preening fantasy, go ahead. Or, how about just buying Bobby Darin's recordings, and forget this kind of celebrity bio rubbish.</p></body></html>

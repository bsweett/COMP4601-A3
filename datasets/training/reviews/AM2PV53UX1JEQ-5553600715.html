<meta name="summary" content="CLASSIC GHOST STORY"></head><body><p>An evocative, old-fashioned ghost story with a series of increasingly shuddery twists, The Others is absolutely terrific.  If you love suspenseful, eerie scary movies with a genuine surprise ending, look no further.  The look and feel of this movie, with its perfect cast -- those British children are haunting, and Nicole Kidman is excellent as their high-strung mother -- give it an ageless, classic aura.  It is hard to shake the wildly original story from your head, once you make it to the spine-tingling finale.  With the same smart, well-crafted feel of The Sixth Sense, but set in a big, old, creepy house perpetually in darkness and fog, this movie delivers the goods and then some.  Boo!</p></body></html>

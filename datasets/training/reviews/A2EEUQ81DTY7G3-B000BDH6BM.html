<meta name="summary" content=""She was our mother and we loved her""></head><body><p>Four Brothers begins with a terrible shooting. Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan), a dedicated social worker, is shot in a convenience store holdup. The crime seems senseless and inexplicable, but her death brings together the four young boys she adopted when she couldn't place them in any other foster home.<br /><br />Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) Jack (Garrett Hedlund) Angel (Tyrese Gibson) and Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) couldn't be more different, but their mother's death devastates them, bringing these ne'er do wells back to snow-covered Detroit. Regardless of their different paths in life they have always considered themselves to be Four Brothers.<br /><br />But perhaps Evelyn's death was not so accidental after all, a closer analysis of the store's videotape makes the crime looks as though it was planned.  Suspicion forces the brothers into a confrontation with a ruthless local crime czar (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who specializes in bullying dominance, forcing his subordinates to eat off the floor.<br /><br />The brothers are helped in the search for the killer by a kindly police officer played with panache by Terrance Howard.  But as the clues unravel, the brothers discover shady dealings, criminal manipulation, and police corruption as the four are determined to get to the bottom of the seemingly senseless killing.<br /><br />Four Brothers' strength is its richly varied cast and a story that starts out strong and builds into a tale of vengeance and retaliation. But the film also has a coarse and edgy quality and it manages to convey with a degree of resonance, a world of grit, crooked cops, gang lords, and contract killers who inevitably control the landscape. The tough quartet is often forced into vigilante action in order to see justice done. Bullets and foul language rule as these bad boys seek out and kill other bad boys who just happen to stand in their way.<br /><br />But the ultimate problem with Four Brothers is its overly convoluted plot. I'm still not quite sure who killed Evelyn, why she was killed, and how she was supposedly involved in all the shady dealings. It's as though the director John Singleton loses focus with the story, while attempting to make a violent film appeal to as many people as possible. Despite his best intentions to portray multi-ethnic brotherhood united in affection, he merely ends shooting up Detroit.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Four Brothers is reasonably compelling, and Mark Wahlberg gives one of his edgiest performances in years. The film is also shot during the dead of winter, so it exudes plenty of chills, with Singleton capitalizing on Detroit's reputation as the dangerous gang-ridden heart of urban America. There's a scene involving a car chase in a snowstorm that is particularly gripping.<br /><br />But despite haphazard bursts of ambition, action and drama, Four Brothers ultimately feels like a gangster genre movie, only without the satisfying payoff. The desire for revenge obviously provides these characters with a strong motivation - and you really get the sense that these characters really loved their mother and really love and are totally committed to each other - yet the long-winded plot lets the movie down with a the story doesn't always work things out in a convincing and clear way.

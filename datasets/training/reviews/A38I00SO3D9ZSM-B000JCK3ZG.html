<meta name="summary" content="A good end to the series [spoiler alert]"></head><body><p>A fitting end (so it would appear) to a very good series.  Last Stand lacks some of the fun the first two X-Men movies, but it's still a top-notch comic book film.  As with the previous two, Last Stand is among the best of the Marvel comics books-to-movies.  In this series, though, it's the weakest of the three.<br /><br />Could there be more X-Men movies?  Sure.  But with Magneto (and Rogue) made human (non-mutant), Professor X, Jean Grey and Scott Summers dead, it would be a pretty bad idea to make a 4th movie, unless the remaining X-Men were teamed with other heroes (Spiderman, Fantastic Four, etc.)<br /><br />It was well-acted and scripted.  Parents, if you're concerned about language, there was some mild cursing.  Otherwise, kids will like it alot.  It will probably disappoint the hardcore comic book fans.<br /><br />Last Stand is definitely worth the price of theater admission.</p></body></html>

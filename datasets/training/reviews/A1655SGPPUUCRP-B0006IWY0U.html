We all know about pirates, sea battles, and swash-buckling, but do we really know about the men behind it all?  No.  Never before have we been given such a privileged look into the lives and hearts of those brave men at sea.  Peter Weir's film follows the British naval ship HMS Surprise and her crew during the Napoleonic Wars as they are relentlessly pursued by the far superior French ship, the Acheron.<p>Russell Crowe, one of the finest actors to come along in the past decade, plays Captain Jack Aubrey.  Aubrey is a man who demands perfection and respect from his crew, yet is enormously loved and respected by all of them.  It is here that "Master and Commander" finds its strength, in the comradery of men.  The naval battle sequences are grand and epic, the dialogue witty, the cast pitch-perfect, the sets and costumes flawless, and the score heart-pounding.  Yet it all boils down to the friendships and bonds between the men.  That is the true heart of "Master and Commander".  This is a fascinating and informative film as well as a supremely moving one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not Nearly Crazy Enough To Hold My Interest"></head><body><p>America, The Present: Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) lives an idyllic existence in the small heartland town of Ogden Marsh with his wife (and town physician) Judy (Radha Mitchell); Ogden Marsh is one of those kinds of small-towns that only seems to exist in horror movies these days, if it had a soundtrack it would be "Fanfare For The Common Man"; if it was a book, it would be written by Garrison Keillor. Whilst attending the first day of the spring baseball season, Sheriff Dutton is confronted by an apparently disoriented local man who wanders out onto the Diamond wielding a shotgun.  The Sheriff is unfortunately obligated to use what police forces all over the world choose to refer to as "lethal force" in order to stop the man. But this is just the first in a series of incidents in which apparently otherwise sane members of the town's citizenry succumb to bizarre fits of mania and, before long, the Duttons find themselves caught in the middle of an escalating epidemic of insanity...<br /><br />Horror film remakes are always a dubious quantity. In my experience, the better ones generally tend to mine the concept and the strengths of the original and rework them in a way that puts a new spin on an old standard (Zack Snyder's excellent remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ABURA">Dawn of the Dead (Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut)</a> is an excellent example of this). Rather mystifyingly, the remake of "The Crazies" does rework the concept of George A. Romero's original film but chooses not to play to the original's strength (which was to devote just as much screen-time to the architects of the mania that have consumed the small town as to it's victims). The net effect of this reworking is that the eerie, verit&eacute; style, amateurish plausibility of the original is eschewed in favour of a series of rather boring sub-standard horror film clich&eacute;s and histrionics which will be familiar to anyone who has seen a horror film of this variety in the last forty years.<br /><br />Then there's "The Crazies" themselves: in my opinion, frankly, they're just not crazy enough.<br /><br />Maybe I've been spoiled by the likes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TJBN8K">28 Weeks Later / 28 Days Later (2 pack)</a> and Garth Ennis' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592910904">Crossed Volume 1</a>, but I am firmly of the opinion that, if you're going to make a film about people becoming psychotic, homicidal maniacs, then the psychopathology and homicide with which you're concerned should actually be up there onscreen and in spades. The first ten minutes of "28 Weeks Later" had me on the edge of my seat (and I remained perched there for more or less the entire running time of that film) but I found myself suppressing yawns of boredom at the tedious antics of the so-called slavering maniacs in this film.<br /><br />Performances are negligible. Timothy Olyphant recycles his stiff-legged Seth Bullock walk from "Deadwood"; Radha Mitchell does her usual sweaty, screaming blonde bit; a chap called Jeff Anderson outshines them both in his role as a goateed Sheriff's Deputy, but no one else really stands out in any way shape or form.<br /><br />"The Crazies" is a missed opportunity. The kind of film you're likely to fall asleep during if you decide to watch it on TV late at night. About the only thing that raises it above a one-star review are some decent production values and a superbly eerie score by "Hitcher" composer Mark Isham.<br /><br />If you're a connoisseur of this kind of film, my advice is to give this one a miss...</p></body></html>

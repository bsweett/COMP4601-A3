<meta name="summary" content="Dystopian Dysfunction"></head><body><p>Oddly, I must be one of the few folks to have seen "Children of Men" and did not form an opinion as to it being a rancid pile of rotting mule skin or the greatest movie since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063UR1">Silent Running</a>. I found the basic premise to be fascinating: How would the world react twenty years into an epidemic of childlessness? Which some of the reviewers here seem to miss...this is not just how the world reacts to the onset of infertility, but almost two decades since the last baby was born. So many industries would fall into slow collapse; education, garments, much of the medical industry, etc...as the population ages past the point where new folks would replenish both consumer and professional.<br /><br />Clive Owen starts off the movie in a coffee shop as the world learns of the death of its youngest citizen. He walks into a city full of violent rebellion and to where Britain is the last nation that hasn't fallen into anarchy. The government has slipped into a fascist state in order to keep from being overrun by refugees, yet Owen's ex-wife (Julianne Moore, great in a brief role) kidnaps him to set a plot into motion. They have discovered the last pregnant woman on Earth, an African named Kee. They need to smuggle her out of England to a mysterious "Human Project" group.<br /><br />This is where the chaos really begins and the allegories become oppressive. Kee's baby has no discernable father (and a miracle birth is even joked about). The miracle baby has factions splitting off of factions before the little savior is even born. Oh yes, the African mother; how very Cradle of Civilization! Plus one reclusive ex-hippie idealist (Michael Caine, all crazy hair, John Lennon and homegrown weed) to emphasize just how badly the sixties failed when they were all so much better then than these fascists now.<br /><br />The heavy handedness of the message is carried by some incredible cinematography, like the near ten minute single-camera shot of Owen racing through the prison camp uprising while under fire. London in decay is depressingly gritty as is the Fugee concentration camp (with shades of Abu Gharib). The sense of dread curdles under each character (like Owen's visit to his brother, the art curator), yet the tiny light of hope of the new baby still stops a war in its tracks, however briefly.<br /><br />It is that final sense of redemption - the "maybe we might get our miserable species out of this mess anyway" message - that keeps the relentlessly bleak view of "Children of Men" from completely tanking. But it's the ham-fisted proletyzing that also stops it from arcing beyond its science-fiction art-house roots.</p></body></html>

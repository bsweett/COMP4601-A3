<meta name="summary" content="A horror comedy masterpiece!"></head><body><p>Two American friends named Jack Goodman (Griffin Dunne) and David Kesseler (David Naughton) are traveling through Europe as they are in England who stopped by a pub where they are warned to stay on the road but on their way to London, they get lost and both get attacked by a vicious wolf. Jack is dead while David is alive in the London hospital alive, he does fall for a lovely English nurse (Jenny Agutter) and sometimes gets ghostly visits by his now undead zombie buddy Jack who warns him that they were attacked by a werewolf and that David will become one when the next full moon appears as he starts to disbelif Jack's warnings he becomes a monster that murders a few people in London but has to find a way to kill himself or else he kills others.<br /><br />A brilliant and very original horror comedy thriller from writer-director John Landis! this is a very well acted and suspensful with brilliant animatronics, make-up and gore effects by Rick Baker with Steve Johnson which brings us no other werewolf transformation as done before on film. The storyline is quite good and so is the performances, there's even a nice appearence by Frank Oz. The film is quite gory at times especially that horrifying massacre of David's family in a nightmare sequence, the film does offer a great soundtrack of oldies and a terrific score by Elmer Bernstein. The Werewolf is very realistic and convincing as the film still holds up today and still remains fresh and popular as it was back in 1981 for it set a new standard in terror, laughs and gore much like "Re-Animator", "Fright Night", "The Toxic Avenger" and "Evil Dead 2" all did.<br /><br />This DVD contains a nice transfer and good sound quality with nice extras like audio commentary, Featurettes, Interviews, Outtakes, Storyboards, Production Notes, Photograph Montage, Cast and Filmmakers Bios and DVD-Rom Extras.</p></body></html>

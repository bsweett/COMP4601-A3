Think anyone will notice?"  - Vincent's time runs out in "Collateral"<br /><br />From Michael Mann, the director of "Heat" and the creator of "Miami Vice" (when the hell is that series coming to DVD?!), comes "Collateral", a taut, suspenseful crime drama that is one of the best films of the summer of 2004, and has outstanding performances from both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx (this isn't your mom's Tom Cruise!).<br /><br />Tom Cruise is Vincent, a cold-blooded hitman who has just arrived in L.A., with 10 hrs. to kill.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is Max, an L.A. cabdriver who works the night shift for the past 12 years in hopes of one day fulfilling his dream of owning his own island cab company.<br /><br />After Max hooks up with an attractive D.A. (potrayed Jada Pinkett Smith) & getting her phone number, he meets his next customer, Vincent, and Max's hellish nightmare begins.<br /><br />Vincent offers six hundred bucks to Max, in return for taking him around the Los Angeles area to meet some friends that Vincent has to see. Max soon finds out, the hard way, that Vincent is a hired assasin, & not only in town with time to kill, but, the friends he mentioned are federal witnesses, to a high profile case, that Vincent must, one-by-one like the Grim Reaper, assasinate. The plot thickens when Max finds out the D.A., he met earlier in the evening, is on Vincent's list.<br /><br />With the police and the F.B.I. hot on the trail, & the clock ticking down to the early morning dawn, Max is forced to find a way to stop Vincent, save the girl, and not become public enemy number one in the eyes of the cops & the feds. Time is not on Max's side.<br /><br />What makes the film tick is the great performances from the two principles.<br /><br />Cruise gives one of his best performances of late and I have a feeling that if the Academy remembers "Collateral", Cruise might garner another Oscar nomination. Cruise's Vincent is one mean mother f**k in this film and comes across cool, calculative, cynical, and cocky. All the elements found in a great villian. The problem for me was, that he isn't one of those villians you love to hate. I actually liked Vincent!<br /><br />Foxx gives his best performance to date as Max. Foxx's Max is the typical everyman who passes the hero test by facing a great fear and rising above it all.<br /><br />The third character in the film is Los Angeles itself. Michael Mann directing the film using digital filmaking technology gives the city an errie sheen that regular film can't quite capture (in one scene while Vincent is walking to one of his destination's in the background the city nightline generates an errie twinkling, while in another Max driving on the freeway toward the nightclub, one can't help but watch the nightsky as the streetlights zoom by). Mann does a great job at generating, and keeping the flow of the action going thruout "Collateral" (I didn't find that the film had any real drag to it).<br /><br />"Collateral", like Los Angeles, is cold, hard, & full of action. Definitely not to be missed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sahara = not Indiana Jones"></head><body><p>Sahara was not better than Indiana Jones obviously.To be honest there's actually no comparing the two at all.I understand why people would think the two are alike but they aren't.Sahara offers more gun shootings , killings and car and boat chases.But all that doesn't even matter ,when you have Harrison Ford playing Indiana and George Lucas is the writer.<br />Sahara was a decent ride ,but people should put there foot in their mouths when they speak of Indiana Jones.<br />Steve Zaun finally plays a tough guy character.He's a weapons specialist and he adds a hint of comedy.</p></body></html>

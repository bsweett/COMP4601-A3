<meta name="summary" content="Forget historical context. Enjoy the spectacle. Great fun!"></head><body><p>If you like old-fashioned epics with casts of thousands and a storyline full of heroes, this 2004 film is for you.  It's almost three hours long but the time does fly.  There are battles and swordsmanship and characters spouting lines that are so overdone that I burst out laughing.  But who really cares about historical context in a film like this?  And if the nuances seem a little modern for this 3000-year-old myth by Homer, it doesn't really matter. When he wrote it, little did he know that it had all the makings of a Hollywood spectacle, including a romance at its core. This is when one of the princes of Troy, after a couple of nights of stolen passion, whisked away the beautiful Helen who was married to the King of Sparta.  Later, Troy would eventually be destroyed because of this and everyone watching the film probably knew that but yet, it's great fun to see how it all plays out.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is cast as Achilles, a warrior for the Spartans who is having second thoughts about the wisdom of serving his king. It's obvious he's been to the gym because of his defined muscles and a body shape crafted by a personal trainer and vitamin supplements. He's also been trained in swordplay and there is one scene in which he is teaching his younger male cousin to fence which might be viewed as homo-erotic.  However, there are other scenes in which he defines himself as a man who loves women, especially in the scene in which he seduces the young female cousin of the King of Troy.<br /><br />The performance of the woman cast as Helen and her Prince lover plays like amateur hour.  However, Eric Bana, an actor I have never seen before, is cast as Hector, the prince's older brother.  His performance is masterful and his presence dominated every scene he was in.  But as far as I'm concerned, the very best performance of all was by Peter O'Toole, cast as the King of Troy.  There is one scene in particular, in which he begs Achilles, who has just murdered the king's son Hector, for the right to give his Hector a dignified burial.  Shakespearian in nature, this is a scene I will long remember.<br /><br />This film can be enjoyed only if you don't think about historical reality and just relax and watch the forces of lust and revenge and warfare and pomp and glitter let you forget that this film is downright silly.  Of course Troy falls far short of my highest recommendation, but frankly, I recommend you see it anyway.  It's a pleasant diversion and an evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

Outside of the standard images that depict dejected men as able to get vuluptuous women into their apartment on call while "sulking", it refreshingly had believable guy/girl arguments. The final argument that causes the breakup was done with such good acting that it caused me to wish for equal material throughout the movie.<br /><br />  The scene at the concert when Jennifer Aniston gets stood up was also one of the most effective empathy grabbers I've seen in a while. I felt so bad for her that I genuinely wanted all this bad blood between the two of them to quickly end. As she cried in her bedroom, I knew this was the best acting I've ever seen Aniston do. Vince Vaughn played off her distress convincingly. Although annoyingly exaggerated at times, Vaughn captured many a man's words with enough accuracy to summon up my own personal regrets.<br /><br />  At the art gallery, the actress Judy Davis who plays Aniston's boss stood out and handled what could have been a yawner with deft and charm. Some detraction lies in the usual attempts by directors to be so super-comedic that a film can lose realism. That hand unfortunately got played one too many times. This caused an otherwise smooth film to occasionally revert back to a clunky dime-a-dozen "romantic comedy."<br /><br />  The original ending was natural. You get zinged with a sorrowful regret feeling that many of us have felt at one time or another. How do I get back what once was, and no longer is?  Overall, the Breakup is as good as this kind of film gets. A better than average mix of chuckles and heartache.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The monster movie that started monster movies"></head><body><p>King Kong is a iconic film that jumped started its genre. There may have been monster movies before Kong, but none with the long term impact of this film.<br /><br />Everyone knows the story. An adventurous promoter gets wind of something fantastic on a mysterious lost island, and sets out to turn a profit from it. They find a native village with a huge wall to protect them against ... something. When Kong, a giant gorilla, takes off with the beautiful blond, the ship's crew sets out to rescue her, finding more dangers and surprises on the island than just Kong.<br /><br />Unlike the remakes, the attraction between Kong and Ann Darrow in the original was all one way. Kong was seen as a monster to be exploited and ultimately feared and defeated. Still, this springboard for animator Ray Harryhausen provided the most realistic monster action seen on screen at the time, and Kong's battles with the other giant denizens of Skull Island were terrifying to behold.<br /><br />Sadly, with the proliferation of horror movies in color, its rare to see a screening of Kong on TV or cable anymore. As a kid I was able to watch it often. But even though more and more channels have cropped up, there is less broadcasting of classic old black and white films like this one. If you don't find one on TCM, you just about won't see a B&W film anymore. And now the local stations don't bother to show syndicated movies at all anymore. Infomercials and mindless talk shows, sadly, have filled those time slots. Therefore a fan of the original Kong wanting to revisit this film, or pass it along to kids or grand kids, just about has to get the DVD now to have a chance to view it. Luckily, the DVDs can be had at bargain prices.<br /><br />I'm also a fan of the Peter Jackson remake. Although it has a lot of critics, I believe that Jackson kept faithful to Merrian Cooper's original ideas, even though he did buy into the 70s idea of having some of the humans begin to care for Kong.</p></body></html>

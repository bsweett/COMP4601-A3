Gregory Peck offers what may be his definitive role (he won the Best-Actor Oscar for it after four fruitless nominations) and, perhaps, the most famous dad in film; as various critics have said, not even Peck himself was as good a father as Atticus Finch, but Atticus is probably what every dad wants to be.  Though slow in pace, the movie is never boring, and the picture it presents of the Deep South (Maycomb Co., Ala.) in the days before Martin Luther King is both fascinating and disturbing.  If, like me, you find yourself puzzled over why the Ewells faked a rape and accused Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) of the crime, your best bet is to read the book To Kill a Mockingbird, which also provides a lot of background about the Finches and their neighbors.  Robert Duvall, today one of our most respected actors, makes his first credited big-screen appearance (with never a word of dialogue) as "Boo" Radley, the mysterious and believed-insane neighbor of the Finches.  This is a movie every child should see and every adult should know.</p></body></html>

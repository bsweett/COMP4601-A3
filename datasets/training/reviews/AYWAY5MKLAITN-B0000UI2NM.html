<meta name="summary" content="A war between Lycans and Vampires!"></head><body><p>Underworld: A place hidden underneath normal eyes.<br /><br />Selene is a vampire. For centuries she, and her group, the deathdealers, have been riding the world from lycons, werewolves. The war has been raging since God knows when. Now, nobody can even remember when the war began or what caused it. But everyone has the same intentions: kill the other group. For years, lycons have been growing scarce, which means that the vampires are winning. But now, the lycons are resurfacing to track an unknown human. Michael Corvin, a hospital worker, is apparently their target--but not for food. From this storyline we can get a sense that both groups want to find out more about him. Along the way there are many cool stunts, excelent history, and even a connection to science. Each person bitten, the curse of either the vampire or the werewold would get passed on like a virus. But what if a human was bitten by a werewolf . . .and a vampire? What would happen then? Find out here.<br /><br />Filled with excitement, unraveling storyline, comic-bookish characters and scenes and unbelievable make-up work.<br /><br />Enjoy, fellow night-owls!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Ruination of the Resident Evil Series : Part Trois"></head><body><p>When they set such a high standard in Part 2, you would expect the producers to come up with something better for Part 3. But no, instead we get a brown-sand and brown-tone saturated film with absolutely no direction, except to let us glimpse one final shot at the end that tells us that there WILL be a Part Four.<br /><br />As an avid watcher of the first two parts, it seemed to me that things were finally coming together for the whole franchise. Milla Jovovich, normally a great actress, seemed to be having trouble getting into the skin of her character but there were moments in Part Two where she seemed more at ease being the superhero she was supposed to. However in Part Three, the 'Old West' spin on things reduces the film to a caricature of itself, and there were points where I could not believe they would commit such hilarious segments to screen. There is one exceptionally poorly choreographed scene here that is an absolute rip off of the '50s cowboy flicks, with Milla playing 'gangsta'. Even on paper, this looks ludicrous, but when you watch her fighting and mouthing these inane one-liners, you can't help but wonder where it all went wrong.<br /><br />Prime problem is the casting. Ali Larter (the psychotic blonde from "Heroes") has no business being in this film. Her role could have been played from anyone as clueless as Lindsay Lohan to Paris Hilton. That's how vaccuous the character is. And then there is Ashanti. Does anyone even remember Ashanti anymore? How on earth did she land a movie role? Thankfully, she is killed halfway through the film, in one of the more intentionally gory sequences, and yes, the movie did get a little better after this.<br /><br />Oh yes, and then you have the 'hero' who 'gives up his life' to 'save the world'. Are we not tired yet of this theme? In this particular scenario, he turns out to be a romantic interest for Milla Jovovich, but yes, parting is such sweet sorrow, so he says goodbye to everyone (a humungously long sequence that reminded me of some sordid Bollywood saga) and drives his vehicle into the zombie lair to explode the entire arena. That is not a spoiler, really, just a statement of how dumb this movie gets as it goes along.<br /><br />Sadly, the Milla connection does not work here. And what was up with her face? EVERY SCENE that Milla's face is in is digitally 'touched-up' so that it looks like she stepped out of a L'Oreal Commercial. We are supposed to believe the woman looks this gorgeous all the time, when in fact the character is a filthy desert renegade, with biological problems to add to it. There were closeups of her that even had glitter and you could see how they tried hard to cake her face up with foundation. Everyone else looked really rough though. What was going on?<br /><br />Part Three of the Resident Evil Franchise is easily the WORST part of the series so far. I think Part Four should be better, because honestly they could not have sunk lower. The best part of this film was the opening when Milla is trapped in the facility and tries to break free. The revelation of the clones were interesting, but it all feels like I've seen this before on some vapid TV Show. Currently, I would rate the video game and its' bare-boned storyline higher than what they tried to do here.<br /><br />Very Disappointing. Back to the old drawing board, I guess.<br /><br />Two Generous Stars.</p></body></html>

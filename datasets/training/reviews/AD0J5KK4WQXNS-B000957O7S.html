<meta name="summary" content="Kevin James looks like he could be the next big thing..."></head><body><p>Hitch is one of these movies that goes for the heart and is quite successful for the most part except where a few scenes towards the end overrun it a bit. Not watching the Hitch trailer is a big advantage as many of the best moments are in that 30 second burst. The introduction of Kevin James as Albert marks a new comedy actor on the rise and we can be sure to see plenty more of him... in fact Will Smith might be undercutting himself (after the summer blockbuster "I, Robot") by becoming the sidekick instead of the leading man in a number of scenes, we still shouldn't be blaming his agent, as this is the kind of comedy we want. The story revolves around Hitch, a sort of matchmaking cupid professional who specializes in the build-up and execution of that `one kiss shot' because `8/10 women believe that the first kiss tells them everything they need to know'. Upper-class fashion slave acolytes and executive board members make up Hitch's main customers and so we are definitely on `Sex in the City' ground that has taken a few lessons from old movies with the same sort of theme. This `Love Doctor' comedy is easily one of the better pleasantry surprises you will see in 2005.</p></body></html>

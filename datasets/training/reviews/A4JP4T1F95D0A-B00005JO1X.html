The CGI was top notch.  The talking animals all looked very realistic.  While a lot of people talk about this being a Christian film, a lot of people would never know if not told.  My wife saw the movie with me and it never occured to her the parallels with Christianity.  I think this is a great film to see with the kids.  It wasn't overly scary and while there is fighting, no blood is shown, and the action cuts away quickly.  Cetainly worth seeing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wait, this is a vampire movie?"></head><body><p>When White Wolf Game Systems sued the makers of "Underworld" for ripping off their world, with its highly social and politicized vampires who sleep for eons and their violent emnity with werewolves, it was assumed it was because they were trying to cash in on WWGS' World of Darkness.<br /><br />Yes and no.<br /><br />"Underworld" is theoretically about vampires and werewolves, but honestly, it mostly ends up being leather-clad people shooting fancy guns at other leather-clad people. In other words, it devolves into the worst sort of World of Darkness game, with angsty gun-toting idiots killing other angsty gun-toting idiots over something that probably made sense at the beginning of the evening, but eventually just becomes an excuse for posturing and gunplay.<br /><br />In the DVD extras, one of the creators of the film says "Underworld" might be one of the best vampire movies ever made. This might be true if no other vampire movies ever had been made. As it is, it's not the worst ever -- the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" movie holds onto the left end of the bell curve with a death grip -- but this confused, muddled and ultimately pointless film isn't much better than mediocre, at the end of the day.<br /><br />Vampire fans are advised to check out "Near Dark," "Bram Stoker's Dracula," "From Dusk Til Dawn" or even "Fright Night" or "Lost Boys" for a better vampire experience.<br /><br />A rental at best. A recommended buy only for the most diehard World of Darkness fans.</p></body></html>

The basic idea is quite appealing: an alternative reading of Christian history, a conspiracy theory based on male chauvinism and competition among the initial followers, a 'what if' follow up with Jesus as a family man. All this is ok and can be turned into an interesting story. Brown has shown us that he could turn it into a hugely successfull story without bothering to write a good novel. His version of the mis-named 'Da Vinci Code' is primitive pulp fiction.<br /><br />Now the movie comes along with some great names in the cast, with a script following the novel as closely as feasible, and ends up with a film that I personally found unbearably bad and incompetent. Everything is overdosed: the conspiracies first of all. The suspense mechanism of the novel was hard enough to tolerate; in the movie it reaches the IQ level of children's pulp cartoons. The two main actors add their share to the feeling of amateurism. I had thought, in the last century, that Hanks is essentially a competent actor. Not here. Let's not talk about the lead actress, she is a total failure. Same goes for other key characters, like the ridiculous Albino played by the former Maturin impersonator, or the laughable French cop played by Reno, or the joke of an Opus Dei leader played by Molina.<br /><br />As we have learned from pharmacology and from cooking classes: the dosis determines if a substance is poisonous, respectively the food edible, or not.<br /><br />This movie overdoses on almost everything and is entirely unpalatable. You might survive it though, if you accept the fact upfront that it is a total loss of your time.</p></body></html>

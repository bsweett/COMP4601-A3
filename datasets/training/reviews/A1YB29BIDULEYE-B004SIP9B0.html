<meta name="summary" content="Long Live Queen Elizabeth II!"></head><body><p>This is another depressing, yet phenomenal film.<br /><br />Very quickly, you really need to see this film with hindsight to appreciate it fully.<br /><br />The film begins with Tony Blair's rise to power. And we can see that Tony's wife does not think much of the queen. (Her translation of the queen's words would probably not be allowed here!)<br /><br />From here, we see Dianne's fatal accident, and while the queen acknowledges the tragedy, Prince Charles is the only one who feels that Dianne has to be treated with royal respect even though she is an X princess.)<br /><br />The major plot of this movie is that the royal family has an unprecedented circumstance here. The death of an X princess who was popular. Add to that that Tony Blair is just settling in, and he knows that certain parties are wondering as to the usefulness of the monarchy. (So things are unstable.)<br /><br />Without going on for too long, her majesty Queen Elizabeth II has legitimate reasons to dislike Dianne. And to complicate things further, she tries to gain control of the situation the way she has in the past. (Remaining unaffected.)<br /><br />Prince Charles receives gentle treatment in this film. He seems to know 2 major things. (1) For the monarch to survive, it must be willing to be flexible with the times. (2) Even more important, unlike his mother, Charles is aware that the Dianne they knew is NOT the Dianne the majority of people knew.<br /><br />While the movie is called "The Queen," one could easily argue that the true star is Tony Blair. He's a competent young Prime Minister who agrees with progression, but he also has a respect for traditions as well as the monarchy. While his wife is anti monarchist, Tony knows that England has a need for the monarchy and they (for the most part) want the monarchy: "Spare me the 'off with their heads' routine."<br /><br />At one point, Tony has to (with some regret) 'strong arm' the Queen to take required action about Dianne. Perhaps the most moving point in this film is when after doing this difficult action, Tony Blair faces down the hostile press and explains that Queen Elizabeth II never wanted this job, that she watched it kill her father King George VI, and that she did the job she never wanted with dignity and grace for almost 50 years.<br /><br />Tony also reminds the 'wicked press' that Dianne: "...threw everything the queen offered back in her face, and for the past few years dedicated her life 24/7 to destroying everything the queen held dear."<br /><br />Keeping this final and climactic speech of Tony Blair in mind, makes watching this film a 2nd time all the more interesting.<br /><br />If you are a fan of English History, you MUST have this film.</p></body></html>

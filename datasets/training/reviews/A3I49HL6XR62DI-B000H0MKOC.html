<meta name="summary" content="The spin starts here"></head><body><p>This movie is really about spin. The tobacco industry is used to showcase how PR can make anything, even a lethal product, acceptable to the public. The insane thing is that you find yourself cheering for the spinmeister himself! A great cast including Katie Holmes in a sexy, hilarious role that makes you wonder why she has settled for being Mrs. Tom Cruise. Robert Duvall is terrific as the tobacco exec who falls victim to his own product. Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

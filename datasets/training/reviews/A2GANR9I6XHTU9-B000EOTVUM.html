<meta name="summary" content="Boring False Account of Tragedy In The Australian Outback"></head><body><p>They say this is a true story but I wouldnt count on it. Now I dont doubt something like this happened but i assume they guessed most of the story due to the circumstances. Think about it for a second...the last camper who manages to survive and live to tell 'the story' never even witnessed his friends deaths nor saw any of what took place. They just assumed what happened because the bodies were never found. My Second problem with this film is how the killer kept popping up oh so conveniently when the timing was correct. For instance, the scene where the girl leaves her friend and ends up in the garage, theres many cars there, she chooses one and gets in and it just so happens the killer is in that one waiting to kill her. Plus how the hell did he get back to the garage so quick and just so happened to be waiting for her in that exact car she chose.<br /><br />Plot- setting, Western Australia, 2 brit girls and one aussie guy decide to go backpacking at a place called Wolf Creek. Very slow moving for the first 50 minutes. The girls & guy end up climbing wolf creek , they come back down , go to the car and the thing is dead. They notice lights approaching and a car pull up and out walks an old aussie guy. Turns out the guy is a whacko then the typical horror movie scenes ensue.<br /><br />Ive seen many many horror films. There is nothing new or novel about this film. Ive sat through Citizen Kane and I still think this film is boring. It dragged on and on then when the killer finally lost it , it still wasnt that great. There is really not too much to say about this film other than it was average run of the mill horror.<br /><br />If you want to see a good horror film try The Original Texas Chainsaw Massacre or if you are interested in seeing a new film that was actually good check out High Tension or Funny Games. They make this film look like Bambi.</p></body></html>

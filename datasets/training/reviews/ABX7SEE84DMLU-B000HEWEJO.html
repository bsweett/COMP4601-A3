<meta name="summary" content="James Stewart"></head><body><p>James Stewart was, before this film, a competent actor with indisputable professionalism.  In the decades after this film, he became George Bailey to the fourth generation after his own...<br /><br />He viewed his own contribution more simply, though.  He felt that acting was a job like any other.  This degree of modesty and "class" is awfully rare these days.  Looking at the whole of his acting career, this film is not really his "best effort."  He was pleased to play good guys and bad guys, heroes and villians, and, I think, longed to be seen as somebody who knew how to deliver the goods regardless.<br /><br />My admiration for him is great, and I miss him terribly.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Predecessor to Today's Superhero Pics, it's Naive But Respectable"></head><body><p>It occurred to me while watching the opening credits that, at the time this first hit theaters, Action Comics #1 was forty years old. Today, that landmark is right around the corner for this film, and that led me to wonder if it had as much to do with shaping my generation's snapshot of the Man of Steel as the original issues did my grandparents'. The world has changed in a lot of ways since the late seventies, particularly in its fashion sense - many civilians' getups are just as outlandish as Superman's - but despite his squeaky clean image and dated morals, there's still something familiar and relevant about this rendition of the big blue boy scout. He's naive to a fault, but there's no questioning his motivations and it's still refreshing to see a nice guy who doesn't finish last. Christopher Reeve is responsible for the majority of what works, and he buys into the role so completely that it's no surprise he'd be associated with the character for the rest of his life. Gene Hackman is disappointing in his first turn as Lex Luthor, but the rest of the supporting cast is spot-on and the script is impressive given its age. Although the much-maligned ending sequence is a total disaster, the rest of the story does a very good job of balancing a mature, serious tone with the lighter dalliances into fantasy that go hand-in-hand with the character.</p></body></html>

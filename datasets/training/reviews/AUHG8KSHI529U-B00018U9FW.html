<meta name="summary" content="Just a fun movie that we enjoyed as a family"></head><body><p>We enjoyed watching this as a family.  The kids enjoyed watching the kids stepping out of the roles of being just kids and having a lot of fun.  Jack Black is who he is and we find that pretty funny, but we can see how others might not.  And I think Joan Cusack makes everything she is in even better.<p>The kids in the class Jack Black is subbing for are all charming and do a fine job being transformed from a bunch of preppy uniforms into a rock band (of sorts).  Of course the premise is implausible and every objection you can raise about the reality of this film is probably true.  But I would reply that you might benefit from lightening up and just having fun.  I know we did.  We laughed and we enjoyed saying, "Yeah, RIGHT!" at the more ridiculous plot points.  This isn't supposed to be a serious movie.  It was just a fun time and you will likely enjoy it if you can get in the same mindset.</p></body></html>

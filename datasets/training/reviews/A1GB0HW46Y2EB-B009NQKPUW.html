<meta name="summary" content="Technically Fine but Lacks Something"></head><body><p>The purpose of Ridley Scott's film "Prometheus" apparently is to explain the origin of what was found on the hostile planet by the group of space travelers in the beginning of the original film "Alien" (1979).  The conclusion of "Prometheus" may be rather ambiguous to those not have seen it and seems to be setting us up for yet another sequel.<br /><br />There are, as expected, amazing optical effects compared to the earlier "Alien" films, but I had difficulty in becoming emotionally involved with  the characters in "Prometheus" as I did not in "Alien" and especially in the later film "Aliens."  I have had the complete Alien collection for a couple of years now and  I still haven't gotten around to watching the third and fourth films in the series and possibly never will.<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but I am coming to regard "Bladerunner" as my favorite Ridley Scott sci-fi film.  In its odd way it perhaps creates characters and a universe you can believe.  The Blu-ray release of this film is especially impressive and greatly encourages repeat viewing.  While "Bladerunner" cannot boast of the technical sophistication of "Prometheus" there is an atmospheric aspect to "Bladerunner" that cannot be denied that "Prometheus" somehow lacks.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Impressed!"></head><body><p>This movie of course has been praised by critics and regular viewers alike which made me wonder what was so great about this rather mysterious film- and also after seeing the rather compelling commercials I just had to see this when it came out.<br /><br />I won't go over the details since so many others here have but I agree with most that this is a very successful film overall. It keeps you hooked from the very first few minutes till the end that has a conclusion that left at least I very satisfied; the story was solid and very entertaining because the cast carried it out very well. The scenes are beautiful especially and at times quite chilling for different reasons at different times of the film. For a good portion of the time this movie is a fascinating adult fantasy, and the rest of the time it is a bleak world set in Spain following the civil war and they mixed both parts so well together- I am amazed honestly.<br /><br />Because honestly if not done right this movie could have been a complete mess- it instead though is a great success. I highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></body></html>

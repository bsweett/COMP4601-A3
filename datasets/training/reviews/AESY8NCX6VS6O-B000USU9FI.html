<meta name="summary" content="Promising cast, promising material, mediocre remake"></head><body><p>Meryl Streep is the kind of actress who impresses you no matter what she does, be it mediocre (she was the lone bright spot of Stuck on You) or masterful (she was a powerhouse in Angels in America), so I was kind of scratching my head a bit when I realized that Streep, reprising Angela Landsbury's notorious role in this remake of the 1962 political paranoia thriller, doesn't have much screen time. That's right, folks, one of the greatest living actresses on the face of God's green earth comes on breathing fire and brimstone in a great scene in the beginning, pontificating and pointing that slender finger like a knife...and then she kinda disappears for a while, letting the revamped plot of Candidate take hold.<br /><br /> And as a plot, it's a little iffy. In 1962, the villains and instigators of a high-level plot to control politics were the commies and Laurence Harvey's Raymond Shaw was merely a noted war hero. Demme and his screenwriting team have made &quot;Korea&quot; into &quot;Gulf War,&quot; &quot;Commies&quot; into a corporation called &quot;Manchurian Global,&quot; and (*scratching head*) Raymond Shaw into a possible Vice Presidential candidate (???). I know Demme and his writers were trying to transfer the movie's pertinence into an area we recognize today, but the contrivances of its plot ever-so-slightly feel just like what they are: a director desperately trying to turn a remake into as much of his own as possible.<br /><br /> Demme is a talented director, though, and he does keep the early scenes of the film charged with a looming paranoid feel that did have me feeling the vibes of the original. And homeboy can do a great close-up, too; those camera-up-your-nose shots Demme favored in Silence of the Lambs are nearly as effective here, especially in a scene where a psychologically damaged Gulf War buddy (Jeffrey Wright) comes to inform Major Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) that he, too, has been having dreams that something else happened on a mysterious night overseas. These dreams that both have been having send the paranoid Marco on a quest to find out the real truth about Raymond Shaw (aptly played by Liev Schrieber), and that consumes most of the film.<br /><br /> Problem is: it's not deliriously engrossing, like the original made it. Marco begins realizing he's right more and more, jumping through the loops of a prevalent conspiracy, and this just kind of goes on and on and on. As I said before, Meryl Streep's Eleanor Shaw disappears from the film, we never see anyone from Manchurian Global, and Kimberly Elise really botches her reprisal of the sultry Janet Leigh role (also changed, in its relation to the plot). Demme turns the movie on a kind of auto-pilot, fading out scenes in a hastily edited fashion, permitting Washington to stammer and yammer like he's posessed by Woody Allen, and even alters the emotional pull of the movie.<br /><br /> I have no problem with a director trying to elicit emotion from his cast and building a scene fraught with it. But, in my opinion, characters in a political thriller should not cry. Case in point: a scene in which Marco and Shaw are together alone in a room. Shaw gives him more and more information about how he might be brainwashed, the ominous (and repetitive) score by Rachel Portman gets heavy in the back...and then Shaw elicits a single tear. WTF?<br /><br /> But Liev Schrieber triumphs, despite that insipid little weeper of a moment. Denzel Washington, on the other hand, can't really escape the way the part has been written for him. In the (yes, I'm bringing it up again - that happens when you remake a classic) original film, Frank Sinatra's Bennett Marco was a strong man who was deeply disturbed by a dream he knew was right. Put in the present day, Washington's Marco never seems confident for one minute; in fact, he seems to be crushed by the very volition of the movie, and you should never crush Denzel Washington. Only if he decides to act like he did in Training Day.<br /><br /> I think I know where they were going with the whole &quot;let's make Denzel a pussy&quot; deal. And that, friends, is this - botching the ending of The Manchurian Candidate like nobody's freaking business. If you've seen the original, you're likely to hang yourself with your underwear when you realize that Demme actually changes who does what in the film's climactic scene (I was ready to). More than that, though, I came to a realization that the grave misstep that the movie makes in that big scene, well, negates the entire purpose of The Manchurian Candidate in the first place. I want to run up to Jonathon Demme right now and scream, &quot;What in the hell were you thinking???&quot; It's that ridiculous.<br /><br /> And it's kind of a shame. The Manchurian Candidate, had it stayed closer to both the plot and the emotional resonance of its predecessor, could have been a gripping yarn that succeeded on technical, narrative, and character levels. Demme's movie has altered all three, and he comes up a little short in each case, which is kind of a bummer for such a great cast (Meryl Freaking Streep!) and such haunting material. The movie has its moments (I sure liked seeing Bruno Ganz from Wings of Desire, but that's just me) since it's well-photographed and occasionally suspenseful, but in the end I still can't see any point in its existence. Denzel, Meryl, Liev, and Demme could have all made great, original contributions to film instead of this unneeded remake. All this movie does is reminds you how much of a masterpiece the original was. GRADE: C+</p></body></html>

They face a Gunnery Sergeant who uses severe and cruel treatment to hammer the recruits into tough marines and ready to fight. One recruit in particular is a clumsy, slow to learn and does not do well in following discipline. His story is one of the first tragic stories in this movie.<br /><br />Another of the recruits winds up being a reporter for Stars and Stripes and he is assigned to go into battle with a marine squad. There his will and preparedness for battle is tested to its limits....<br /><br />This movie was directed by and produced by Stanley Kubrick. He also helped to co-write the script and it is one of his best movies. It is certainly one of the most dramatic movies I have ever watched and that starts at the boot camp scenes though the final battle scene. The movie features a good script with excellent acting from multiple actors. It even features some of the best depictions of the horror of war and the effect that it can have on people.<br /><br />This movie is ranked among the top ten war movies ever made and it deserves that ranking in my opinion. I strongly recommend it to you if you like war movies and seek realism in what our soldiers went through. This is also one of Stanley Kubrick's best films that he ever made. Buy it and watch it, you will not be disappointed.</p></body></html>

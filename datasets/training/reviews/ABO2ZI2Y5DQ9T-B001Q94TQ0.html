<meta name="summary" content="Story of Maria, 17-Year-Old Girl in Columbia: Stunning Debut of Catalina Sandrino Moreno"></head><body><p>Even if you don't know the name of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, you will remember her and her strong acting after watching this stunning drama about "Maria," Columbian girl who becomes a "mule" hired by drug dealers. The film is partly suspense, partly drama, but no matter how you categorize this low budget film, you cannot deny the powerful acting of Catelina Sandrino Moreno who grabs your heart from the beginning to the end.<br /><br />The film slowly builds up its quiet first half set in Columbia, showing the life of 17-year-old Maria (Catalina Sandrino Moreno) who does not seem very happy living there. We are going to see her problems - about her family, work, and boyfriend -- but at the same time we also watch the social conditions seen from the viewpoint of an ordinary girl.<br /><br />And you may think no ordinary girl would accept the job of becoming a mule. The film, however, convincingly recreates the atmosphere of the place in which there are very few choices left for the ordinary girls like Maria, and an opportunity of becoming a mule comes as if it is a part-time job like babysitting. The guy who offers her a job of delivering something to someone in New Jersey does not look so bad, speaking like her own grandfather. But by the time we see Maria's decision, we realize the strong undercurrent that pushes girls like Maria. She silently and quietly, accepts the job, knowing the dangers of being arrested, or death.<br /><br />One of the most amazing things about the film is that we come to share the values of Maria while we know that what she does is morally wrong. Of course she knows it is wrong, but she knows (or she thinks she knows) it is the only way left for her. But after the suspenseful travel to New York and the horrible accident she encounters there, Maria is no longer what she was. And her next step should be a more independent one.<br /><br />[HARROWING DETAILS] You heard the stories of mules bring illegal substances into the countries like America by swallowing them. The film director Joshua Marston, it is reported, has interviewed the women who recounted their own experiences as mules, and the details of the business-like routine of the training to be one are one of the most realistic and harrowing experiences I have ever seen. Not that it is violent. It is painful to see because it is done as if it is nothing.<br /><br />But the most impressive is the energetic performance of Catalina Sandrino Moreno, who realized a realistic and credible portrait of an ordinary woman in Maria, which defies our easy categorizing of the good and the evil. She could be both good and bad, or strong and weak at the same time, and her powerful acting gives a human's face to the social concern in which humans are often treated as figures or ciphers. Among many merits of the film, the last is the most difficult one to achieve, and for that reason alone, the film and Catalina Sandrino Moreno should be praised..</p></body></html>

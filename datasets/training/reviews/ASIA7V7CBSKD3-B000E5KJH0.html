<meta name="summary" content="The Graduate 2"></head><body><p>"Rumor" is a good movie, but you definately need to see "The Graduate" first - or the movie just won't reach its potential.  Kevin Costner is great once again and Jennifer Aniston gives what could be her best performance to date.<br /><br />For those that ever wondered what happened after "The Graduate" - after as in the next 30 years - then "Rumor" is a movie you need to see.  Funny, dramatic, it draws you in and makes you not want to miss a scene.  A must see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Shrek Without Shrek"></head><body><p>My adult daughter "made" me watch this movie, a take off on the Repunzel fairy tale.  I rolled my eyes, thinking this another Disney clunker, but boy was I surprised.  This was a snappy, fun movie with clever, likeable characters and a fun plot with plenty of action, kind of like Shrek without Shrek.  And, not surprising because it was a Disney film, the animation and computer generated effects, were both beautiful and exciting.  This was a good film that a wimpy ending could not even ruin.  When your daugther asks you to watch it, or any movie for that matter, don't roll your eyes!  Especially about Tangled!</p></body></html>

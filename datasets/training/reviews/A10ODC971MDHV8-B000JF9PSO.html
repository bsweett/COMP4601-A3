<meta name="summary" content="United 93"></head><body><p>Filmed in real time using actual United personnel and air-traffic controllers, along with a fine ensemble cast of nonpro actors, Greengrass's ultra-realistic tribute to the victims of 9/11 has the jittery look and flavor of a documentary, though it is largely speculative. Most faithfully, we witness the confusion of authorities on the ground as they begin to suspect that not one, but several planes, have been hijacked, then desperately try to scramble F16s and reroute thousands of aircraft after the first jet hits the World Trade Center. Harrowing to watch and horrifying to contemplate, "United 93" is ultimately an important, respectful film about the extraordinary resolve of ordinary people.</p></body></html>

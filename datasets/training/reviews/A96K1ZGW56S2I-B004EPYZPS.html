While filming one night at the local train station, the boys and the star actress of their production are witness to and somewhat involved with a horrible train accident that unleashes a mysterious creature. Soon after, all the dogs in the town run away, people start disappearing, and all kinds of pieces of electronics and machinery are stolen. Oh, and the military has moved in and blocked off the area around the train crash. While watching footage that was shot on the night of the crash, Joe and his friends make a startling discovery. The boys attempt to finish their movie while at the same time solving the mystery of the alien creature.<br /><br />SUPER 8 is a sci-fi movie that has very little to do with sci-fi. Instead, the movie is more of an action movie drama that's about relationships. The core of the movie is about the relationship between Joe and his friends. They are a close knit group of companions, but you know that after high school they will go their separate ways, perhaps some of them never to meet again. At the same time, you know that some of the friends will be friends throughout life.<br /><br />Besides being a movie about the relationship between childhood friends, SUPER 8 is also a movie about family. The movie begins in an incredibly depressing manner with the death of Joe's mother, her funeral, and the immediate aftermath. After her death, Joe and his dad (Kyle Chandler) attempt to hold on while forging ahead; adjusting to the new normal after the death of a close loved one is extremely difficult. There's also the relationship between Joe's love interest, Alice (Elle Fanning) and her own father (Ron Eldard). In a completely different vein, there's also the budding relationship between Joe and Alice. Oh, and there's the whole thing about our own relationship as humanity with other creatures (in this case an extraterrestrial creature).<br /><br />I really enjoyed SUPER 8. It's one of my favorite movies from 2011. The movie was directed by J.J. Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg. I felt the film was a decent film on its own. It's a nice little story with some great moments of acting. However, what sticks out most about the movie is the overwhelming since of nostalgia that swathes every inch of the film like a college dorm reeking of potpourri incense. The movie isn't just a homage to the late 1970s and early 1980s, it's a full blown love song that blares out over Abrams's film boom box as he stands outside Steven Spielberg's office. There were a lot of movies made in the 1980s that were Spielbergian in tone or style. However, in the past twenty years, not even Steven Spielberg has made many Spielbergian movies. SUPER 8 resurrects the Spielbergian-style of filmmaking. The movie pays homage to a slew of other films (and in some cases outright steals from some): E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, and THE GOONIES are easily the largest influences. However, there are several others including JURASSIC PARK, JURASSIC PARK: THE LOST WORLD, JAWS, GREMLINS, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Also, the zombie movie the boys are making, "The Case" has several references to George Romero and his zombie films.<br /><br />Like most of Steven Spielberg's and J.J. Abram's previous works, not everyone will enjoy SUPER 8. It has a broad appeal, but the tone and style won't appeal to everyone (probably most particularly those over the age of sixty). Nevertheless, most viewers will find something to enjoy in SUPER 8 especially if they focus on the relationship between the characters and not the overall story.<br /><br />The DVD of SUPER 8 doesn't include many extras. There's the usual commentary with director J.J. Abrams and some of his crew. Done correctly, this often can be one of the most rewarding extras of a DVD. However, in this case, the commentary is incredibly boring. Abrams and his buddies croon about Spielberg throughout, there are long pauses throughout where there is no commentary or discussion, and there really isn't any new information revealed that wasn't already available in the promotional materials for the movie and DVD. The other special features include a short featurette with Abrams and his crew entitled "The Dream Behind SUPER 8". That featurette was more exciting that the DVD commentary. There's another featurette entitled "The Visitor Lives: Creating the Creature" that features the main creature designer for the alien. This is an interesting look at the process of how the alien came to be created. Lastly, there are a series of trailers for upcoming and soon-to-be released movies.</p></body></html>

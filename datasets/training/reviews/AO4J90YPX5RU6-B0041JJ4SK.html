HAROLD & KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE is one few and far between comedy in which you actually laugh out loud, several times even. There are many classic moments like "battle sh*ts", "riding the cheetah" and "Neil Patrick Harris snorting cocaine off a hot babes @ss" ..among others. John Cho & Kal Penn have more chemistry than a chemistry set. They are hilarious together. I hope that director Danny Leiner is planning a HAROLD & KUMAR GO TO AMSTERDAM sequal. It's a must! The DVD features some interesting extras. "The Art of Fart" follows one of the films sound effects members around in truck stops hoping to record the perfect farts and diarrhea sounds for the "battle sh*ts" scene. Also there are some deleted scenes & outtakes. Plus interviews with the films two leads Cho & Penn. Beyond an R rating this DVD is the EXTREME UNRATED version. Check it out, it's a real good time.</p></body></html>

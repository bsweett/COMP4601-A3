It is easily the most intentionally comic of the series, and features a cleverly plotted mix of real drama and sci-fi, and placing the action in  then-present day Los Angeles gives it a peculiar point of view, one that  succeeds almost brilliantly.  Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall inhabit their  roles so completely that you believe utterly that they are apes, and that  their peril is real.  Since I love the twists in a movie that give it  gravity and an enduring quality, I love the strange sense of doom and  tragedy that pervades this movie, even when it is at its most humorous.  The final moments remain chillingly effective, and paved the way for the  many, many copycat plots featured in movies yet to come.  Forget BENEATH...  -- go directly to this movie; you will not be disappointed.</p></body></html>

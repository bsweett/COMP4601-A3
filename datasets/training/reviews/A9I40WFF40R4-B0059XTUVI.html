Surely if there is any justice left in Hollywood,  she, just having won the Golden  Globe,  will get an Oscar for her splendid performance as Britain's first and only female prime minister. This movie is not to be missed. While the supporting cast  is superb, particularly Jim  Broadbent as Denis Thatcher in old age, this film  belongs to Streep and Streep alone.  She is in most of the scenes; when she is on screen, it is all about her. There is obviously  no role she cannot play.<br /><br />The film opens with Mrs. Thatcher debilitated with dementia and flashes back to her days as a young woman-- played by another actress-- and then as prime minister of course. In practically one-half of the movie, we see her in the present when she cannot remember that her husband Denis is dead. There is a particularly poignant scene where she is signing books and mistakenly writes "Margaret Roberts, " her maiden name instead of  "Thatcher." For those of us who have had family members with dementia, we recognize immediately that Ms. Streep, sad to say, is perfect as this character-- her gait, her vacant stare, her confusion.  And she has all the fire and steel that we associate with Thatcher in her days as prime minister.<br /><br />While I suspect that Ms. Streep does not share the prime minister's political views, it is easy to see why she chose this role since Mrs. Thatcher, whether you like her or not, had an uphill battle as a woman surrounded by men in government.<br /><br />The riot and protest scenes are riveting as the prime minister often is driven through them. The soundtrack is beautiful. I recognized "Casta Diva" from NORMA and some Bach also.<br /><br />You will be wrung out at the end of this film but glad you saw it.</p></body></html>

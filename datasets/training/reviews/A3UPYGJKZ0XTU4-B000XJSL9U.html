<meta name="summary" content="Satisfying Action, but Even Sillier than Most Action Movies."></head><body><p>"Live Free or Die Hard" is the 4th movie in the 19-year-old "Die Hard" franchise, and NYPD cop John McClane is looking a little elderly. After the FBI's computers are breached by hackers, Deputy Director Bowman (Cliff Curtis) of the agency's Cyber-Security Division wants every computer geek with the skills to have done the job brought in for questioning. NYPD officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) is asked to escort a young hacker named Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) from New Jersey to FBI headquarters in Washington, DC. But someone is out to kill Farrell, and the nation's transportation systems, financial infrastructure, and power supplies are being thrown into chaos by an unknown cyber-terrorist.<br /><br />The action is generally satisfying. The car stunts are not CGI. A confrontation between an 18-wheeler and a fighter jet is creative, if improbable. The script deflects some of the incredulity at seeing a 52-year-old Bruce Willis survive these stunts by poking fun at his old bones and low-tech approach. The plot and dialogue are silly even by action movie standards, however. The film simply alternates between action and geeks tapping on keyboards. Farrell's greasy-haired, socially inept computer geek stereotype is a couple decades out of date. Geeks are yuppies now. We see too little of villains Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) and Mai Lihn (Maggie Q), who seem more interesting than the people we do see. Good action, but "Live Free or Die Hard" has trouble maintaining interest and credibility between action sequences.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007 Unrated single disc): There are 2 versions of the movie on the same disc, the theatrical PG-13 version and an unrated version with a little more gore and stronger language. The sole bonus feature is an audio commentary by director Len Wiseman, actor Bruce Willis, and editor Nicolas De Toth. Willis and Wiseman talk about the evolution of the characters and story, to which they contributed. Other topics of discussion include edits, the differences between a PG-13 and R rating, the creative crew, and filming the action. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.</p></body></html>

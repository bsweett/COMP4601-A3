<meta name="summary" content="The actors save this one"></head><body><p>I was entertained by this movie....up until the end. It had suspense, action and an enigma at the heart of the movie. It was a bank robbery movie - or was it? What kept me riveted were the performances of the central actors - Jodie Foster, Denzel Washington, etc....as well as the various moral ambiguities and twists and turns.<br /><br />  It was not, however, totally plausable and for that reason I have to give it a less than stellar rating. Without giving too much away, I can only say that I found the central premise to be a bit hackneyed and the ending, such as it was, left too many loose ends.<br /><br />  However, I HIGHLY recommend getting the DVD, if only because the bonus features are wonderful. There is an interview with Spike Lee and Denzel Washinton, a kind of retrospective of the movies they've made together, the challenges, the experiences they went through. THat was fascinating to view.<br /><br />  Also, Spike Lee's commentary (if you choose that option) is also well worth hearing. He is a brilliant filmaker and his insights about how he composed various shots, how he envisioned this film, etc....offer much to budding scriptwriters, film students, actors or people who simply like to watch movies, even if they never want to be a part of a film crew.<br /><br />  The film itself, however, left something to be desired, at least for me. Would I watch it again? In a heartbeat but only for the pleasure of watching the actors and actresses in this one. The plot would not be the main draw.</p></body></html>

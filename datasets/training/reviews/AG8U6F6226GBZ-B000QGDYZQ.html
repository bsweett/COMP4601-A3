<meta name="summary" content="Another weirdo for Sandra"></head><body><p>She's a very good actress and especially good in comedy, but why has this actress chosen such awful films?  First it was the weird one about the Lake Mystery, which you had to watch twice to even understand, and now another weird movie about premonitions.  Oh, and how about the one where she played a witch who brought back a dead guy after she and her sister magically put him to rest.  The first part of that movie was actually very good with a very good cast, but then it turned south and sour and totally absurd.  Too bad. Sandra, find yourself a good script for a change. And please no more beauty contests either.  I have liked 2 of her films.  The Net and Two Weeks Notice. Surely she can find more good scripts like those.</p></body></html>

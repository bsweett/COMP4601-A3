<meta name="summary" content="Great Cast - No meaning"></head><body><p>I found little meaning in this movie.  I enjoyed the idea and the historical setting, yet it seemed a little surreal.  <p>It was much like 'Once Upon a Time in America.'  If you like that type of movie, you would like this.  <p>The senseless gore of the film was what irked me the most.  DiCaprio is not too believable, yet Lewis rocks as a the archetypical villain.  He is utterly believable. <p>It is a story of revenge.  DiCaprio's character at least did not give up his quest to avenge the death of his father.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Scavenger Hunt"></head><body><p>Luckily, Earth is far from the interspace wars that rage throughout the universe; that is what makes it such an attractive place for alien refugees seeking asylum on some unnoticed planet inhabited by a simple, somewhat-intelligent, and technologically-backward species that is willing to make room for them; of course, we jumped at the chance to establish a safe haven in exchange for a few trinkets. . . .<br /><br />An enclave was established in New York City.  By treaty, the aliens had to blend in and not reveal their unearthly origin.  While a few lucky alien species could pass themselves off as human; most had to rely on organic-mechanical contrivances.<br /><br />Keeping the aliens in line was a tough policing job and keeping their presence on Earth a secret required constant vigilance, and in general, it worked, but unfortunately not all species are covered; one such, is a particularly obnoxious species: the Bugs. . . .<br /><br />One night, not long ago, an unlicensed, immature Bug crashed his flying saucer into Edgar's pickup truck.  Luckily for the Bug, Edgar stormed out of his house to see what had happened.  Unfortunately for Edgar, Bugs are indiscriminate eaters and Edgar's skin would suit it well until it could find and snatch the Arquillian's prize possession; foolishly, an Arquillian had brought it to this defenseless planet. . . .<br /><br />Picture (Blu-ray): 4.5 to 5.  Languages and Subtitles: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Thai.  Additional Subtitles: Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Dutch, Indonesian, and Alien.  The "Alien" option is underwhelming.<br /><br />Special Features: possible additions, beyond those listed in older DVD reviews: a MIB trivia game and "Ask Frank the Pug" ( he is an alien, in a dog suit, who has the inside scoop).  He will answer your questions about love, money, and etc.  Be sure to talk loud; Frank is a little hard of hearing. . . .</p></body></html>

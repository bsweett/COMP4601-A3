<meta name="summary" content="Move over Jack Bauer, James Bond and Jason Bourne...Here comes Brian Mills!"></head><body><p>Critically Acclaimed writer/producer/director Luc Besson ("Taxi", "The Fifth Element", "La Femme Nikita", "The Transporter" and many more action films) returned with an action-packed film which was released in France in early 2008 and released in the US in Jan. 2009.  Besson known for giving crew members opportunities, gave his cinematographer for "The Transporter", Pierre Morel his first major International film with "Taken".<br /><br />Written by Besson along with writing partner Robert Mark Kamen ("Gladiator", "The Karate Kid 1-3', "Taps", "Lethal Weapon 3' and many more), "TAKEN" would feature an all-star cast which includes Liam Neeson ("Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace", "Gangs of New York", "Batman Begins", "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian), Famke Janssen ("X-Men" films, "The Wackness", "GoldenEye"), Olivier Rabourdin ("La cour des grands", La face cachee", "La Clef) and Maggie Grace ("Lost", "The Fog").  "TAKEN" which cost around $25 million to make, was financially successful as it grossed over $220 million worldwide.<br /><br />"TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT" is featured in an "Unrated" extended-cut version which includes two extra minutes over the theatrical feature (which is also included).  There is a two disc version which includes a digital copy file on the second disc.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"TAKEN" is featured in Widescreen (aspect ration of 2:40:01) and where many films tend to show the beauty of France, Director Pierre Morel wanted to show the real France, which include the seedy areas where prostitution and European gangs are located.  So, you get the gritty side of France and overall, picture quality is pretty good.  Granted, this is on DVD but I can imagine that on Blu-ray, this film's transfer would be wonderful with the amount of detail, outdoor scenes and action scenes involved.<br /><br />As for the audio, audio is featured in English 5.1 Dolby Digital  (Spanish and French audio tracks in Dolby Surround are included).  This film sports a lot of action scenes.  From a car chase, many gun and machine gun shots, a pop concert and crowds galore, this  film utilized all 5.1 channels.  I was very impressed that I can only imagine how much immersive the Blu-ray DTS-HD Master Audio would be. Overall, the DVD's audio is well done at Dolby Digital 5.1.  I also watched the film in French and was very impressed by the quality of the voice acting!  Well done!<br /><br />Subtitles for "TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT" feature English, French and Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT" features the following special features:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary by Director Pierre Morel, Cinematographer Michel Abramowicz and Michel Julienne (Unrated Version Only) - The commentary is featured in French with English subtitles.

It was also interesting to have a action-based International thriller that is not centered around terrorism but a real life problem of human trafficking and kidnappings of young women forced to take part in prostitution and forced into a life of drug addiction.  "TAKEN" features a perfect blend of action that is not overdone but most importantly, a well-written storyline that complimented the action scenes.  Director Pierre Morel who is very experienced as a camera operator knows what kind of shots he wanted and Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen together again for another well-written action-packed thriller.<br /><br />I also have to say that I was surprised when I first heard that Liam Neeson would be the action-star of this suspense/thriller.  Even listening to the audio commentary, the writer Robert Mark Kamen was surprised but realized that Liam Neeson is a tall and fit actor, and Director Pierre Morel felt Neeson was perfect for the job.  Granted, we have seen Neeson fight before in films like "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" but his performance as a Jack Bauer-style agent who will do whatever it takes to find his daughter was impressive.<br /><br />Personally, I want to see more of Neeson as the character of Brian Mills.  I think there are a lot more storylines that this character can take part in and similar to a film like "DIE HARD", I really hope the planned sequel is just as action-packed as this first film.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the performance of Maggie Grace.  Having enjoyed her performance in the first and second season of "LOST", I was surprised to see the popular blonde from the show as a brunette.  But Grace did a wonderful job in playing an older teenager who seemed quite reserved but most of all, hitting her emotional scenes effectively.<br /><br />The special features were quite interesting, especially learning how Director Pierre Morel likes to be behind the camera while he directs but also hearing the enthusiasm by the people involved with the film and the audience in France.  Also, it was very touching to see Liam Neeson together with his wife, the late-Natasha Richardson and how loving the couple were and even having her share the same stage with him during the press photography with both Besson and Morel in France.<br /><br />Overall, "TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT" is an action-packed film that takes you on one heck of a wild ride.  Well-done job for second time director Pierre Morel, beautiful cinematography by Michel Abramowicz, well-written screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen.<br /><br />Also, wonderful performances by Liam Neeson and the rest of the cast.  But combined with a DVD featuring an immersive and aggressive soundtrack with well-done utilization of all speaker channels, "TAKEN" is an action thriller worth owning on DVD and having in your collection.  I'm guessing that the film is much more impressive on High Definition for Blu-ray, so if you have a Blu-ray player and want an excellent action film, "TAKEN" is title worth checking out.<br /><br />In the likes of James Bond, Jason Bourne and even Jack Bauer, I definitely want to see more of Brian Mills!  "TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT" is highly recommended!</p></body></html>

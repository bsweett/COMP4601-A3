The art work is actually a leap forward from 'Snow White' and the earlier classics. It took me awhile to get used to the new technique when I first viewed the film--but now I recognize how effectively it manages to convey the "feel" of a genuine fairy-tale.<br /><br />A nice discussion of the art work is featured in 'The Making of Sleeping Beauty' which accompanies the latest VHS release of the film. Aside from the richly textured backgrounds and brilliant animation, 'Beauty' is blessed with the rapturous singing voice of Mary Costa's light soprano doing full justice to the ballad, 'Once Upon A Dream'. The idea of using Tchaikovsky's 'Sleeping Beauty' music for the background score and songs was an excellent decision. Music is used throughout to emphasize either the bright or darker moments in the story, always very effectively. Choral work is superb, as are the orchestrations.<br /><br />This is a film that can be enjoyed on so many different levels--music, animation, story, art work--it ranks with the very best of the classic fairy-tales from Disney. And yes, Maleficent, in all of her wicked glory, makes the most impressive fire-breathing dragon you're ever likely to see!<br /><br />Just acquired the 2-Disc DVD version and it's a fascinating Collector's Item for anyone truly interested in this animated classic, with all the extra features giving you "the whole package" on Disney's back story and illustrating how the film was conceived from the start. It also gives you the option of Fullscreen or Widescreen versions.</p></body></html>

It's quite a shame that Robert De Niro would be involved in something like this. Dakota Fanning is a wonderful actress for her age and this film does not do her justice. It is a shame, really. This film does not scare, thrill or satisfy. I would stay away if you have not already watched it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Long Live "The Queen"""></head><body><p>Helen Mirren won the 2006 Academy Award as Best Actress for her impeccable portrayal of Queen Elizabeth of England. "The Queen" maninly focuses on the death of the beloved Princess Diana and its aftermath and how the Queen wanted to treat her death as a private family matter instead of a public spectacle in which British Prime Minister Tony Blair wanted. The film depicts the public disaapproval over the Queen's decisions during this time and how she reacted to their opinions.<br /> Hellen Mirren is amazingly perfect in the role of the Monarch. Her speech patterns and mannerisms are impeccable and she shows that the Queen is in essence a real human being with real flaws and emotions.<br /> "The Queen" was budgeted at 15 million dollars and blew expectations for its success out of the water grossing over 100 million dollars world wide. Fans and critics hailed the moving for Mirren's searing portrayal of one of the most well loved figures in modern history.<br /> The DVD features an excellent "making of "The Queen" featurette" along with an informative commentary by Director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan.<br /> Richard Roeper of "Ebert and Roeper" states "the acting is pinpoint perfect".</p></body></html>

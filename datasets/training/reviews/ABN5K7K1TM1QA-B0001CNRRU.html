Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu throws out a line of tension and keeps it incredibly taunt from beginning to end while exploring the most fundamental human emotions: fear, love, lust, and tragic loss.  He uses a technique being seen more and more in film, a technique in which the story is not told in chronological order, but temporally scattered.  This technique is similar to that used by, for example, Christopher Nolan in Memento (2000) in which the story is told in reverse chronological order.  Here there is a mixed pattern as the story unfolds, sometimes in sequence, sometimes out of sequence.  At first it is disconcerting, then intriguing, and finally everything is abundantly clear.  I don't think this technique is necessary, but it does have the virtue of forcing the viewer to become engaged in trying to figure out what is going on.  And perhaps this heightens the cinematic experience.<br /><br />There are three stories strung together on a single strand of fate.  First there is the story of Jack Jordan (Del Toro) a petty macho criminal who has found Jesus.  Second there is that of Paul Rivers (Penn), a college professor of mathematics who is dying because of a defective heart.  And third there is that of Cristina Peck (Watts) who has found what she wants in life with a husband she loves and two young daughters.  And then there is the tragic accident that seals their differing fates, and brings horror into their lives.  The story is told in starkly realistic scenes spliced in jarring juxtapositions, skipping from one character's story to the other.  The effect is to give us relief from the terrible events of one part of the story only to lead into another, and then to pull away from that story and into a third until the stories appear as one.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about the performance of the three leads.  Sean Penn is brilliant in an understated way as he projects (by turns) charm and tenderness, desperation and hope, and a kind of hopelessness headed for a flat line.  Naomi Watts is electrifying in the intensity she brings to the most emotionally-wrought scenes.  She is one of the most amazing actresses working today, and if you haven't seen her, see her here.  You won't forget her.  She was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress (losing out to Charlize Theron in Monster).  And much the same can be said of Benicio Del Toro who was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (losing out to Tim Robbins in Mystic River).  Del Toro's portrayal of a fated man who both found and lost his faith because of tragic events and his own failure of character was totally convincing and very sad.<br /><br />If I had to nitpick I would say that Cristina's initial feeling that she couldn't be bothered to help prosecute Jack Jordan for killing her family did not square well with her later feeling that she wanted to kill him.  Yet, I suppose, one's feelings can change.  I also didn't think Jordan was the kind of character who would hit and run.  He takes responsibility for his actions.  He turns himself in and says that he has a responsibility to God.<br /><br />As far as the ending goes, note that Cristina is dressed in bright, almost happy colors because of what was discovered when she donated her type O-positive blood to save Paul's life.  Obviously I can't reveal what was discovered in a review, but I'm willing to bet some people found it redeeming and hopeful while others found it ironic while still others may have found it cheap and easy.  Personally I thought it worked because everything in this movie revolves around very physical human events.<br /><br />Bottom line: may be too intense for some viewers, and put the kiddies to bed.</p></body></html>

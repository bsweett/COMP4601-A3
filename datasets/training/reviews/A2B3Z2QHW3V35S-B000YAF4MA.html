It might make your passing easier. This is a good movie about two guys, who never met before they shared a hospital room together. They are both dying from cancer. After they were told how long they have to live they made a bucket list. For those who don't know what that is. It is a list of things to do before passing.... Kicking the bucket. They set off together to do all of the things on the bucket list. In the end they were both happy to have known each other.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="E.T. As Allegory"></head><body><p>I was almost disappointed to find out (from Wikipedia, darnit) that E.T. has long been viewed as a  kind of Christian allegory.  That particular interpretation dawned on my benighted critical soul relatively recently.  I assumed that others had come up with similar interpretations and that probably somewhere out there some enterprising film student--or DIVINITY scholar--had gotten a dissertation out of the notion.  So I never laid claim to much originality there, but when I ultimately did make that connection on re-viewing the film a while back, I decided to roll with it.  As it turns out, you COULD make a case for E. T. as a kind of parable.<br /><br />In my own case, it occurred to me that E.T.'s glowing heart (and those of his fellow aliens, also glimpsed in the film) reminded me of something.  Oh, yeah, I realized eventually: it's reminiscent of the the "Sacred Heart" imagery from my Catholic boyhood.  E.T. as a Christ figure?  Then I started making a game of it.  Came down from the heavens, sure, sure.  Has HEALING powers, aha!  Suffers the little children unto him (and avoids all contact with yucky--and corrupted--grown-ups); he dies at the hands of oppressive authority figures but is resurrected and, well, he ascends to the heavens thereafter.<br /><br />It all fits rather neatly, but would a nice Jewish boy like Steven Spielberg really have set out to make a Christian fable.  He joked about it himself apparently, asking how he would ever be able to explain such an effort to his own mother who ran a kosher restaurant in L.A.  Moreover, would a Christ-figure actually avoid interaction with all adults or would he--as the Biblical Jesus did--start to shake up the status quo as much as possible.  And turning water into wine is one thing, but downing a six-pack and inducing a drunken state in the ten-year old child with whom you've telepathically bonded is quite another matter!<br /><br />I jest, of course.  But since there have been serious attempts to classify Snoopy as a Christ figure, I guess the case can certainly be made for E.T.  (at least he's SUPERHUMAN).  What it's really all about, of course, is those universal archetypes that nearly all cultures embrace and employ in one shape or other, and which artists employ overtly or covertly for their rich symbolism.<br /><br />Another little apercu.  In this age of sequels, prequels and spin-offs, it's commendable that Spielberg and crew never attempted to cash in on the E.T. phenomenon and come out with E.T.2 a few years later--or E.T.25 more recently. For once, a story which could have easily been "sequel-ized"  (Elliott visits E.T.'s planet; E.T. returns to Earth and runs for president) was left alone.  A "Second Coming" in this instance could only have been disappointing--with E.T. phoning it in rather than phoning home.  Thank the good Lord for Mr. Spielberg's restraint.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="REVENGE IS SWEETER THAN A MOTOWN CLASSIC"></head><body><p>Much has been said about the resemblance of "Four Brothers", and the old John Wayne film, "The Sons of Katie Elder", but I'm not going to compare the two. I'm not going to say this is the gritty urban version of the mid-'60's shoot-'em-up John Wayne western. I'm not going to say it. THE HELL I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT! Even the four brothers swagger and demeanor, their sibling regard for one another, and their distinct characters, while poking around dangerous city streets looking for the killer of their adopted mother, suggest the actors studied that classic western intently. Give them cowboy hats, a few cows roaming around, some six-guns at their side, and you have, "The Sons of Katie Elder", in leather and jeans. And that's fine because "Four Brothers" is as entertaining, as wholesome and nobly violent, as the pistol-packing template that inspired it. You come to believe in this brooding male family unit, and the Motown classics soundtrack, and other soul and rock music sprinkled throughout, (apparently Mom was a big Temptations fan), gives the film a cool '70's feel, like The Sons of Katie Elder meets Shaft.</p></body></html>

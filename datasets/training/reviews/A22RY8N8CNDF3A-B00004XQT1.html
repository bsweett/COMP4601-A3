<meta name="summary" content="Satirical Yuppie Killer Thriller"></head><body><p>American Psycho stars Christian Bale as the status conscious Patrick Bateman, who is also a ghoulish killing machine. The movie satirizes the yuppie culture of materialism, using a modern day "Ted Bundy" serial killer.  American Psycho is set in the 1980's and Patrick Bateman is a broker in New York.  His colleagues are young men his age, who vie for the best business cards, restaurant reservations, ties, and suits.  It all seems so meaningless and sterile as they arrogantly discuss what trendy restaurant to eat dinner at each night at a local club.<br /><br />Patrick Batemen lives in a expensive New York apartment and starts each morning with a shower and narcissistic regimen of skin care.  He is misogynistic, and self centered, spending time with same-aged colleagues sharing a obsession over classy business cards, designer glasses, ties and suits.  His public personality hides a murderous rage at small frustrations.  When his anger mounts then it is taken out on anyone, including his do-worker, prostitutes, homeless men and models.  During the murders he plays music and critiques the songs of Huey Lewis and Phil Collins.  Chloe Sevigny plays Patrick's secretary and Reese Witherspoon plays his fiance.  Both are wonderful actresses and give the movie some depth.  Although there are many murders in the movie, the actual killing scenes are not graphic, although plenty of blood and bodies are seen throughout.  Patrick gets away with everything with his public persona - clean cut professional - just like Ted Bundy.  Even as Patrick is loading a full body bag in the car a friend comes up and comments what a gorgeous bag - is it Armani?  Patrick grunts and groans as he puts the body in the trunk and responds the correct designer.  There is no one who really suspects him, and he has a lawyer who covers his trial when an outside detective starts asking questions.  He is highly protected  in a world of money and style.<br /><br />American Psycho is a great satire on Yuppie culture.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Could it happen to someone you know? To you?"></head><body><p>This film is a harrowing experience.  The principle cast of four all spiral to their respective dooms, all fueled by the use of &quot;recreational pharmaceuticals&quot;.  Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are believable as buds who see the drug game as a way to escape their lower socio-economic lives, even as they do not see the way that their own abuse of these drugs makes such an escape impossible.  But it is the overpowering performances of Ellen Burstyn and Jennifer Connelly that burned a raw place into my psyche.  Ellen Burstyn's Sara is not a junkie.  She is just a lonely, overweight middle-aged woman who dreams about being younger, thinner, and not nearly as alone.  Jennifer Connelly's character comes along for the ride with her boyfriend, but by degrees she descends lower and lower.<p>You have to watch it to see how low these characters fall.  This is not a happy-go-lucky movie.  But if you are interested in a well-made, well-acted cautionary tale about the dangers of addictions, you'd have difficulty finding one superior to &quot;Requiem&quot;.</p></body></html>

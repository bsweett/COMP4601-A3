<meta name="summary" content="Thriller based in Chicago"></head><body><p>Someone somewhere in Hollywood is really trying their best to keep Jennifer Aniston's career alive.  This thriller is based in Chicago and it is fun to watch Metra Union Station, downtown and I believe Evanston sites.  But even fine actors like Clive Owens and Vincent Cassel cannot save this film with a predictable plot.  Female audience - watch this with your husband/boyfriend, just as a way to gently remind them that at all times they are bait for the con - even on their way to work.  Perhaps this movie can help them appreciate what they've got.  Otherwise, this film is really just not worth mentioning.</p></body></html>

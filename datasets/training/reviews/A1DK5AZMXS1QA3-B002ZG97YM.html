Previous releases include Beowulf, Pathfinder, The 13th Warrior among others.  All these previous movies shared one result; bad reviews.  Now Dreamworks takes a stab at the genre with an animated comedy, and scores one of the biggest hits of 2010; How to Train Your Dragon.  Unlike Shrek, Over the Hedge, Antz and Dreamwork's previous animated films, this one focuses primarily on human characters and their relationships, with only one key non-human involved, the dragon Toothless.  And interestingly, Toothless does not talk, which is rare in animated films.  Yet the combination works out.  The movie is funny, the storyline is extremely original, and the characters have depth and create empathy among the audience.  Most of the comedy is either slapstick action comedy involving the dragons, or humorous dialogue between the viking characters; all of which is appropriate for even the youngest children.<br /><br />I consider this one of the best movies of 2010.  This would have been the best animated film of 2010 if Toy Story 3 was not around.  But since both films came out this year, we might see 2 animated nominations for the Best Picture at the Academy Awards come February.  Both the Blu-Ray and regular DVD come with an additional short film featuring most of the main, human characters from the main movie.  This short film is quite entertaining, though it is pure comedy and lacks some of the heart of the feature film.  There are no additional scenes in the movie, just the standard features that come with a DVD, such as interviews with cast members, and a history of the effort it took to go from book to film.  Overall, worth the time to watch it, and the money to buy this set.</p></body></html>

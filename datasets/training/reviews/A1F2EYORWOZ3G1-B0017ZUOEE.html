Boy am I glad I did.<br />This movie really pulls you along until the final moments. It starts with a good pace and gains momentum as the minutes go on. I felt myself completely drawn in, which is not easy to do.<br />I won't cover the plot here, that's been done already. I will say that if you want a movie that will make your skin shiver and have you jump at every noise then this is the one. Definitely made for scares and thrills. I hope we see more from this director.</p></body></html>

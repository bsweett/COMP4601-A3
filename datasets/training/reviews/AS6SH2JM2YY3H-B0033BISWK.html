<meta name="summary" content="The shoe is on the other foot... when aliens, not humans, are the downtrodden species"></head><body><p>So many science fiction stories are about aliens attacking, subjugating, or exploiting humans.  In District 9, the shoe is on the other foot.<br /><br />One day, a gigantic space ship comes to a stop over Johannesburg, South Africa.  After a few months with no other movement and no communication, the ship is opened, only to discover over a million aliens living in squalor.  These aliens (eventually called, derogatorily, "prawns"), cannot explain how they came to be there, or how to operate the ship.  They are settled in Johannesburg and, after 20 years, the settlement is a massive slum.  The movie begins with the initiation of a massive resettlement process to move the aliens to a new "settlement" (a guarded camp away from Johannesburg and its people).<br /><br />To abide by international laws affecting refugees, a mid-level bureaucrat (Wikus) is assigned the task of getting the aliens to sign a release authorizing their relocation.  The interaction between Wikus and the aliens is comical and horrific at the same time.  But when Wikus is accidently sprayed with a strange "fluid," his life, and his relationship with the aliens, changes radically.<br /><br />The cinematography in District 9 starts off in a herky-jerky fashion, and the viewer gets pulled into an intense story just as the cinematography, and the plot, gets more complicated and coordinated.  At the end, I suspect 99% of all viewers yelled or thought, "What happens NEXT!"  We will never know, but it's a great topic to bring up with friends in a cafe.<br /><br />I've seen this movie twice, and I wish I would have watched it on the big screen.  I really see it as becoming a classic sci-fi flick, pushing the boundaries of what is typical - humans being noble and aliens being ethically challenged usurpers.<br /><br />Not this time.<br /><br />Unique weapons, a novel language, the matter-of-fact way of killing alien babies, NIgerian scammers, the power of money, the power of love, the status and treatment of refugees, ... these are all introduced in this film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

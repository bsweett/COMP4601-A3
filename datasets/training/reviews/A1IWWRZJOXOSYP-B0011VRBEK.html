Korea has two major film festivals, one is government-sponsored while the Blue Dragon festival has been controversial because it is sponsored by a conservative newspaper -- like the Fox news of Korea -- and has had scandals about vote buying.  Despite that controversy, from what I've read, it is highly influential in Korea.  This film won three major Blue Dragon creative awards.  Park Chan-Wook won as Best Director; Choi Min-Sik won as Best Actor; and Gang Hye-jeong (or Hye-jeong Kang) won as Best Actress.  The film also won the Grand Prix Award @ Cannes in 2004.<br /><br />The story grabs you from the start.  We watched the DVD in Korean with English subtitles to hear the powerful original voices of the actors.  As Oh Dae-su, Choi Min-sik does a masterful leading performance.  His character goes from obnoxious drunk to the driven haggard man who seeks revenge.  Both he and Yu Ji-tae again work with director Park Chan-Wook on "Lady Vengeance," with a similar theme, this time with a woman falsely imprisoned.  Yu Ji-tae as Lee Woo-Jin is a smooth corporate success.  The set designer creates a cold austere penthouse where Lee Woo-Jin showers in a glass stall in his office and has waterways built into the floor.  The subplot of his illicit relationship with his sister and his murder of her is chilling.  Gang Hye-jeong as Mi-do does a good job of being the unstable caregiver that adopts Oh Dae-su upon his release and falls in love with him.  Oh Dae-su's best friend No joo-hwan is played by the paunchy Dae-han Ji and fills the role with believable friendly support.<br /><br />The images in this film are startling.  Oh Dae-su eats an Octopus.  (Apparently, Choi Min-sik is a Buddhist and had to do prayers after this scene.)  The tongue scene was gruesome & hard to watch.  The actor who plays the blond assistant to Lee Woo-Jin also did an excellent job throughout the movie.  The cinematography is top rate.  From the prison set that looks like an Asian Motel 6 to the penthouse to the outdoor images, "Oldboy" visually impresses the viewer.  While I read the usual accolades on the DVD box, I was not expecting such an excellent film.  This one is stunning.  Bravo!</p></body></html>

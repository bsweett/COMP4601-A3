David Fincher broke new grounds in 1995 with the release of the psychological thriller 'Se7en'. Since its release, the suspense genre has reached newer levels. Se7en is not particularly a deep movie, but it has the ability to leave the viewer both in deep thought and awe. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and David Mills (Brad Pitt) are two detectives, an old veteran and a young newcomer, that's being hired for a murder-case. This turns out to be a case of a serial-killer, and the killer's victim is people committing one of the seven deadly sins: Gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. . The movie is incredibly dark not only in tone but physically. Somehow cinematographer Darius Khondji manages to take a desert setting in the middle of the day and make it dark, shadowy and bleak. The dark look of the movie adds to the overall feel of despair.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is good as usual even though he seems like the same person as he plays in about every film I've seen him in: the old, wise and confident man who got the answer to almost every question. Brad Pitt is also good in, what may be one of the best performances I've ever seen by him. The same can be said for Gwyneth Paltrow (who plays David Mills' wife), even though I haven't seen many films from her. But the one, who steals the show, is Kevin Spacey. His straight face zombie-like pose and flat monotone dialog is downright creepy. "Seven" pretty much gets your attention from the very beginning and then throws you a pretty disturbed title sequence which makes you kind of twitchy and puts you in the proper frame of mind.<br /><br />The movie starts off very graphically with the 'gluttony' killing. If you manage to make it through the scene where the body is discovered (I swear, you can almost smell that apartment!) and the autopsy scene you've already sat through the goriest parts. This doesn't mean that you can relax, though. I don't ever recall seeing a film which provoked such a reaction in me. But then, twisting conventions and reversing clich&eacute;s is exactly what Se7en aims to do (even the final credits roll upwards rather than downwards). One of the best mainstream Hollywood films of the '90s.</p></body></html>

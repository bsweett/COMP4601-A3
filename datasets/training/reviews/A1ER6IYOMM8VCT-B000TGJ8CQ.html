<meta name="summary" content="NICK CAGE'S BEST MOVIE IN YEARS!"></head><body><p>This is one of the best action movies I've seen in years. The film is a mix of the films 'Memento','Ground Hog Day' and 'Spider-Man'. The premise is interesting, there is lots of action, a decent love story and a guy with a super power!.....well sort of. Nick Cage is perfectly cast as a magician in Las Vegas with a unique ability to see into his own imediate future. Pay close attention as Cage's character will go from seeing his future to present in a matter of seconds. This reminded me of Spider-man's "spider sense" as Cage is able to do some pretty cool tricks with his incredible ability. Jessica Biel is Cage's love interest and she does a very good job...not to mention, she's really nice to look at! A very cool story that had me totally engrossed from beginning to end.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Old Fashioned Film."></head><body><p>The summer 2004 movie season officially got underway with the release of VAN HELSING.  The movie was written by Stephen Sommers (THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS). The film stars Hugh Jackman (X-MEN, X2) as Van Helsing, the famed literary vampire hunter who killed Count Dracula.<p>Unlike the usual interpretations of the character, Jackman's Van Helsing isn't an aging scholar fighting his last battle. Instead, this incarnation of Van Helsing presents the character as a 19th century James Bond crossed with the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, who is employed by the Vatican as a secret agent to ward off the forces of evil.<p>After the movie's introductory episode with Mr. Hyde atop Notre Dame in Pris, Van Helsing returns to Vatican City. His superiors send him to Trannsylvania, Count Dracula's hunting grounds.  For half a century Dracula has been living in a symbiotic relationship with the villagers. But Dracula has begun killing more and the village is under siege by werewolves.  Dracula is up to something big and only Van Helsing can stop him.<p>VAN HELSING is full of plot holes, many of the characters lack development, and there is some really corny dialogue.  However,  the movie has some amazing special effects and provides some very interesting interpretations of literary and movie characters (I especially enjoyed the representation of Frankenstein).  The movie isn't meant to be a deep piece of cinema.  It's a movie that does what movies have done since they were first invented:  entertain and excite.  VAN HELSING is a great piece of mind candy to chew on.</p></body></html>

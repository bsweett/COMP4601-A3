I would have given it three and a half stars if I could. Although not "The Lion King" caliber, it is quite good. This may cause some cringes as most people associate rats with filth and disease. The thought of a rat touching your food isnt exactly mouth watering.<br /><br />A rat follows a TV show put on by a French chef and begins to experiament in changing his garbage fare into something more delectable. When he ends up in Paris he tries to help the chef that inspired him by assisting his son in the chef's restaurant. Interesting take on how a food critics perspective changes. Good quality DVD with great replayability.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Video and Audio Quality"></head><body><p>Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />Both the 2.40:1 (or 2.35:1) video and DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio are excellent in this Blu-Ray movie.  I have not complaints about the audio or video quality.<br /><br />The movie is full of action, but I found it boring anyway.  Some movies I wish would never end, but I thought the end of this movie couldn't come soon enough.</p></body></html>

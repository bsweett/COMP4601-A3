The Hutus and the Tutsis were locked in warfare and many people were senselessly slaughtered as a result.  Devoted to his family and the people around him, Cheadle's character does whatever he has to do to protect them, whether it's theft or bribery.  The story is told with brutal honesty and is a demonstration of the world turning its back on a country in need.  Cheadle lives by his wits and charm, but is always true to those he cares about.  His loving relationships with his wife and children keep him anchored and always on course.  This is an excellent movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still Good"></head><body><p>This was a good installment in the series.  Willis is getting a bit old for the action star, but he carries himself well in the picture.  Justin Long does well as a comedic side kick.  The story is tailored for modern times by having cyber criminals being the baddies.  The main criminal is a little one dimensional and bland, but the action of the film more than makes up for it.  The unrated version is the way to go with ramped up swearing and action.  If they could make another the quality of this picture, I would certainly go see a part 5.  This is a worthy film to add to your other 3.</p></body></html>

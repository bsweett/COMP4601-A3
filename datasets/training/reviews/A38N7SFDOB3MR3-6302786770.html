<meta name="summary" content="An Epic, Standard-Bearing Western. 94 out of 100"></head><body><p>Having been born the same year as the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, I was unfamiliar with the movie until this year. While reading commentary by Stephen King regarding the influences of his Dark Tower series, I noticed that the Good, the Bad and the Ugly had an huge impact on his desire to create the series. So, loving the Dark Tower books, I decided to view this classic Western, not knowing what to expect.<br /><br />Let me state that outside of Firefly, I know little about westerns and the genre. I was neither hot nor cold before watching this film. I was prepared to watch a good movie, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is an epic movie with a expansive, almost endless feel. The scenery in the movie left me feeling that the Western land in the film went on forever.<br /><br />The story follows 3 men, Clint Eastwood as Blondie, Eli Wallach as Tuco, Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes, as they search for $200,000 in coins. Eastwood does an amazing job as Blondie.<br /><br />Eastwood defines the hard-nosed, cowboy hero/anti-hero role with this performance.  And Eli Wallach plays Tuco perfectly. You sometimes love Tuco, and sometimes hate him. At the end of the movie, half of you wants him dead and the other half wants him to live. Cudos to Eli Wallach. Lee Van Cleef puts in a wonderful performance as well. The opening scene in which he stands in the doorway, and interacts with a remote family is brilliant.<br /><br />For a long movie, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly does not drag. I fell in love with westerns as a result of seeing this movie (and Firefly), and am now planning on adding a few more older westerns to my "must see" list.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, please do so. It is a classic, with great acting, an awesome feel, a great story, and wonderful cinematics. I have nothing bad to say about this film.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 94<br /><br />49 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

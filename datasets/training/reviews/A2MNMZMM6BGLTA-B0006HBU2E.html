<meta name="summary" content="Better than the first"></head><body><p>I liked this movie better than the first for a couple of reasons. First and for most (SPOILER ALERT)...<br /><br />They kill off his ugly dog faced girlfriend right at the beginning.<br /><br />A couple of other reasons are these:<br /><br />1)Brian Cox is a great actor and is good in everything I have seen him in.<br /><br />2)Joan Allen is also great.<br /><br />3) Julia Styles... not so great. Why the hell she was even in the first one is beyond me. For god sake she stinks as an actress but her part in the first one was almost nonexistent so I can only assume a great majority of her part must have ended up on the cutting room floor, no great loss. But then they bring this schlub of an actress back and expand her part. The only thing that was good about her was when I thought that Jason Bourne might actually be ruthless enough to kill her.<br /><br />The villians in this are also really good.  Damon is pretty good as an actor though his really large head is sometimes distracting but he makes his buddy Bad Actor...er... I mean Affleck look like somebody from you kindergarten play that portrayed a tree cause he couldn't keep his booger eatin' finger out of his nose long enough to speak and chew gum at the same time. But I say, check out Bourne Supremacy. The first one was good. This one was better. If you like fast paced action and intrigue you'll like this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="(4.5) A bitterly funny satire"></head><body><p>Normally, I am not a very big fan of satire.  In general, I think that satires are too smart for their own good.  By saying that, I mean that most satires tend to identify their target in too serious of a manner that greatly affects the film's ability to make you laugh.  Thank You For Smoking definitely does not fit into that category, I am happy to say.<br /><br />The film's main character, Nick Naylor, is a lobbyist for the Academy of Tobacco Studies, which is based in Washington and is funded by conglomerate tobacco to get statistics that are favorable to cigarettes, their dangers, and their addictiveness.  Naylor is immediately identified as the "bad guy," as we first see him on The Joan Show, where he has to defend himself against an army of experts and "cancer boy."  Naylor shows off his ability to defend himself, and cigarettes, to a bitterly hostile group of people ready to devour his soul.  When a senator from Vermont launches a campaign to put a "poison" label on cigarette packs (complete with a skull and crossbones), Naylor is summoned by his company and "the Captain" to go out to Hollywood to persuade a major Hollywood talent agent to get his stars to start smoking in films again, to make it cool.  While that is the basic storyline of the movie, the film also goes out of its way to create a really cool relationship between Naylor and his son.  Apparently, this wasn't in the book and is totally a creation of Reitman's script, and it is what really makes the movie complete and somewhat meaningful.  Naylor's grooming of his son to become as talented a talker as he is is really entertaining, and is what really holds the film together.<br /><br />Not only is the story good, but the jokes are also very funny.  Unlike most other satires, Thank You For Smoking directly identifies its target very clearly, but it remains entertaining and light-hearted by basically playing both sides of the fence.  Both sides of the political spectrum will be reddened by some of the things that are depicted in this film.  And, it seems, the film applies smoking (a very controversial issue these days) to many other situations that have a very similar concept that are also very prevalent in our society.<br /><br />I have to also mention the amazing all-star cast that is in the film.  Whenever your film's cast list includes the names of talent such as Robert Duvall, Sam Elliot, William H. Macy, Maria Bello, and Rob Lowe, you know that acting is pretty much an ace-in-the-hole.  Surprisingly enough, the best performance in the movie, in my opinion, was by far David Koechner.  Koechner plays the representative for the gun companies in the weekly meetings of the MOD (merchants of death ) squad.  Whenever Koechner was entered into a scene, I almost started laughing immediately, and I hope his performance in this film makes his name a little more widely known around Hollywood, because he has great talent (as also shown in Anchorman).<br /><br />This movie is a definite recommendation for anyone that enjoys not only satires, but what most would refer to as "intelligent comedy."  It is really great to be able to go see a film and laugh your butt off while also feeling like your IQ level didn't just drop 50 points.</p></body></html>

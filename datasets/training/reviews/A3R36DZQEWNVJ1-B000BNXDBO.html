<meta name="summary" content="the trip to White Castle only goes so far"></head><body><p>Harold, played by John Cho (Better Luck Tomorrow) and Kumar, played by Kal Penn (Van Wilder) are watching TV and see a commerical on the best tasting burgers ever made from a place called White Castle. The commercial gets them so hungry that they set out on a trip to go find the White Castle and satisfy their craving, only to wind up being caught off course from strange encounters with other people. You'd have to be high and maybe of taken two hits of acid to of liked this scattershot comedy yet again about two friends and it was directed by the guy who brought the stupid Dude, Where's My Car? to the big screen.....big surprise..not. The hilarious thing in this movie was the scenes with Neil Patrick Harris (Starship Troopers,  Doogie Houser) in them....when he was tripping out on E in the back seat of the 2 buddies vehicle and when the 2 buddies finally make it to White Castle, he is there because they talked about the place so much they gave him a craving for the tasty burgers as well. Also starring David Krumholtz (CBS' Numbers), Eddie Kaye Thomas (Black & White, American Pie), Ethan Embry (Cant Hardly Wait, They), Fred Willard (A Mighty Wind, Idle Hands), Jamie Kennedy (Enemy Of The State, Scream), Ryan Reynolds (Waiting, Alarmist), Anthony Anderson (Scary Movie 3, Romeo Must Die) and Christopher Meloni (Tv's Law and Order SVU) who plays the deformed hillbillie with puss spewing out of his neck which was just wrong. The toilet scene shouldnt of been in this movie either.</p></body></html>

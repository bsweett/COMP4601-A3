<meta name="summary" content="Why couldn't Martin Scorsese have told Braddock's story?"></head><body><p>I was very excited about the release of this film. James Braddock has always been one of my favorite stories in the history of boxing. His story, known to all now, would certainly make a great movie. Unfortunately, this isn't it.<br /><br />Director, Ron Howard, in an effort to add drama to a story that required no enhancement, has produced a movie full of one dimensional characters and elongated scenes of sloppy sentiment. The film has so many scenes of slushy gush, surging violins, and black-hearted villains that the true character of Braddock is lost amid the stock Hollywood set-ups.<br /><br />Howard, who seems physically incapable of trusting an audiance, has to give his cartoon Braddock many hurtles. Poor Renee Zellweger as Mae Braddock is forced into the stock role for boxing movie wives, that of shrill shrike withdrawing all support from her husband for his dedication to the fight game. The real Mae Braddock, of course, was made of the same stern stuff as her husband and was nothing but supportive of Braddock's career.<br /><br />And of course there is the problem of Max Baer<br /><br />Howard had to have a villain, I suppose, without any shades of grey, so the memory of Max Baer is sacrificed. I cannot recall a Hollywood creation that has so criminally maligned the memory of a real life character as does Howard with his treatment of Max Baer. In the movie, "Max Baer" is a killer of men that clearly enjoys killing and hurting people. He is a repulsive, crude braggart that threatens to Kill Braddock in the ring, suggesting that once he has done so, he will be glad to "comfort the widow."<br /><br />In reality, Max Baer was a gentle man who was nearly cursed with a sledgehammer punch and powerful physique. He did kill a man (Frankie Campbell) in the ring, and it nearly ruined his life. Everyone close to Baer commented on the deep depression he entered after the horrible event.  Baer helped Campbell to his corner after the fight (Campbell died hours later in hospital, not "on the spot", as in the film) and went with him to the hospital. Baer paced the corridors outside Campbell's room, praying aloud. When he was told that Campbell was dead, he broke into sobs so that tears ran down his face. His first act was to approach Campbell's widow, who was with him at the hospital and ask her forgiveness. She gave it instantly, comforting Baer by telling him it wasn't his fault - explaining that it might have gone the other way - that it was just the fight game.<br /><br />Baer was unable to sleep for a week after the fight, saying that he couldn't stop reliving the fight over in his mind. He began smoking again, a habit he had licked to stay in shape. Everyone that knew him agreed: he was never the same fighter after the death of Frankie Campbell. He simply didn't punch as hard and all the joy had gone out of the sport for him. From that day forward, boxing was just a job he was good at. Baer himself said, "Nothing that ever happened to me - nothing that can ever happen to me - affected me like the death of Frankie Campbell."<br /><br />Max Baer's son, Max Junior, said that as he was growing up, his father often cried when thinking about Frankie Campbell. For those interested in the real James Braddock as well as the real Max Baer, let me suggest Jeremy Schaap's excellent biography, "Cinderella Man" from which most of the above details come from, and which does not suffer from Howard's adolescent need for "bad guys" to tell a story.<br /><br />Perhaps Ron Howard might some day make a film about Max Baer to put things right. But no, that wouldn't work. In that film Howard would still need a villain and James J. Braddock would have to become a drunken wife beater.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I can't believe it took me so long to see this movie!"></head><body><p>I bought the DVD because I knew I'd love the film, and I do. First of all, every single notable British actor that you can think of is in this movie. The plot follows approximately ten different couples who are struggling through their respective relationships. Some of my favorite couples are Hugh Grant's character (the Prime Minister) and his outspoken assistant, Liam Neeson and his adorable son, and Colin Firth and his Portuguese maid. The best scenes in the film are between Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, who portray a married couple going through a rough patch. This is an amazing movie that will have you in fits of laughter one minute and fighting back tears the next. The DVD is great because it contains over 20 minutes of deleted scenes, most of which are very good.</p></body></html>

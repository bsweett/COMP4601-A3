He and his buddy are rescued after baring their souls. Emphasis is on the families. Action is at street level. Only the shadow of the first plane against a building is seen as it flies toward the WTC. Subtlety works. There was not a dry eye in the house. I recall the morning of September 11, 2001. I awoke at 6 A.M., went into the bathroom, looked in the mirror and decided to shave my head. I had never done that before. I cut my hair, shaved my head, went back to bed and went to sleep. The phone rang. It was my mother. She was crying. She said, "They've hit New York. They've hit Washington, D.C." I thought, "My God! We're in a nuclear war with China." I was actually relieved when I found out what happened.</p></body></html>

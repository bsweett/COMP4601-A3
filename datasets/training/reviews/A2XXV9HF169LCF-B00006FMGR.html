Unless you're one of his hysterical teenage girl fans, or some ... admiring punk boi, Eminem probably doesn't strike you as a likely star for a movie. And when you see the trailer, well.. it looks a titch autobiographical, and probably not your speed, right?  <p>Get over that skepticism, and some night when you have little else to do, rent this. Watch it with a somewhat open mind. Ignore all the hype, expect it to be a nice and honest little growing-up film, and you'll probably enjoy it. It's very well made, and the ending is satisfying. Yes, there are cliches. Of course there are; did you really expect it to be otherwise? This *is* still hollywood. No, it's nothing like the trailers make it out to be, but that's ok; I don't think I've ever seen a movie that was anything like as cool as the trailers want you to think it is. That's the purpose of trailers, after all; to make you want to see it, awful or not. <p>If you've seen the video but not the film, the film will be a bit different from what you expect; the video is *not* (repeat: NOT) a mini version of the film. Some clips are used, but they're used out of context. This is not Eminem's autobiography. It's a sort of fable about a boy out of place in his world.<p>There are some extremely funny bits.</p></body></html>

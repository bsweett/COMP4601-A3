<meta name="summary" content="Let's join the rest of the civilized world and adopt universal health care"></head><body><p>Yes, I'm sure that Michael Moore, as a crafty entertainer as well as a documentarian, exaggerates for effect on occasion: I'm sure the socialized medicine systems of Great Britain, Canada and Cuba aren't the picture-perfect utopian ideals they may appear to be in "Sicko", and- yes- our own system isn't as horrible as it's made out to be, either.  But Mr. Moore has convinced me that there's a broad truth at work: other countries have moved beyond health care for profit and the United States should, too.  Any imperfections in a socialized medicine system are far less serious than the shortcomings of our own system, where providers routinely attempt to skimp on treatment because doing otherwise is bad for the bottom line.<br /><br />Interestingly, the movie mostly concentrates on people who DO have health insurance in this country, demonstrating that private, for-profit care often isn't much better than having no health insurance at all.  Then we see how much happier people seem to be in other countries where health care isn't an issue: if you get sick, you get the treatment you need.  Again, I'm sure there are foibles and inefficiencies in universal, public health care systems, too (anything run by humans won't be perfect, after all), but who can honestly argue that health care decisions should regularly be made with an eye toward the bottom line?<br /><br />"Sicko" delivers its credible message in a thoughtful, entertaining, and, unfortunately, often heartbreaking manner, and a plethora of special features on the DVD drive the film's points home further.  Don't miss this one.</p></body></html>

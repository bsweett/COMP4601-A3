<meta name="summary" content="Sweet and sharp, 'The Holiday' is good holiday fun!"></head><body><p>Excited as I was to see `The Holiday' I was very skeptical.  I had heard some horrible things about this movie from some of the critics, and while I generally avoid anything the critics have to say, when the critics say something bad about Kate Winslet (an actress who NEVER gets a bad review) then I get a little scared.  As the credits began to roll though I realized that critics are seldom ever right and if it stars Kate Winslet it can't be bad...I mean really, when has she ever gone awry?<br /><br />`The Holiday' ends up unfolding as a double feature, and for the most part it's split right down the middle, the first half dealing heavily between Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and Graham (Jude Law) and the second half dealing more with Iris (Kate Winslet) and Miles (Jack Black) and this works well beings that for the first half Kate comes off somewhat dull and Jack is all but nonexistent, and right about the time of the movie that you start losing interest in Cameron, Kate steps up her game and Jack appears in almost every frame...it really does work well.<br /><br />So the story follows Iris and Amanda as they, sick and tired of their lives at the moment, decide to trade homes, cars and lives for the Christmas holiday in an attempt to escape the stress and find themselves.  Iris has been pining for her co-worker and ex-boyfriend Jasper (Rufus Sewell) for three long years only to have him get engaged to another co-worker without having the decency to let Iris know.  Amanda has become all but detached from her cheating boyfriend Ethan (Edward Burns) and has lost herself in her work.  Both Iris and Amanda realize they really, truly NEED a vacation.<br /><br />So, after meeting online Iris heads to LA and Amanda to London and it's there that their lives are soon forever changed.  Like I said, the first half of this movie BELONGS to Cameron and Jude, especially Jude who in actuality owned this whole movie proving that he is such a talented actor.  Kate and Jack quickly become background characters as Amanda and Graham (Iris's brother) begin their passionate affair.  Right about the time that they encounter the same trouble most couple endure Iris and Miles begin to get closer and closer and take over the film, becoming the focus of the second act sort-of-speak.<br /><br />Nancy Meyers, who also wrote and directed `Something's Gotta Give', proves that she is capable of making a sweet comedy that grabs you and makes you smile.  Cameron is delightful here, and her redition of the crying fits that made Diane's character so wonderful in `Something's Gotta Give' is priceless.  Kate, shines bright in the second half, and her meandering in the beginning of the film I blame solely on the script that kept her strapped until she was needed.  Jude Law is utterly fantastic, and as I mentioned, the best performance here and Jack Black is funny and witty, and while he may have been a bit miscast he wasn't as dreadful as he could have been.  Let's just say that by the time he's on the screen Kate has picked up so much slack he could have drooled in a corner and he would have been fine.<br /><br />So, `The Holiday' may be just what you need this holiday, something sweet, funny and smart...something you'll remember as a delightful experience and one I'm sure you'll revisit.  I will say that there is one scene in particular that almost made me cry, the scene where Iris, after befriending screenwriter Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach), is in the company of an Oscar...I mean how cruel to have one of our greatest actresses (in my humble opinion Kate is our finest working actress today) in the presence of an Oscar when she herself has been SNUBBED four times (I still can't believe she's been nominated for four brilliant performances and hasn't won one of them)...I mean, I was almost in tears it was so depressing!</p></body></html>

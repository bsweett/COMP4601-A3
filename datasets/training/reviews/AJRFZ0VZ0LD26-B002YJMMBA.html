<meta name="summary" content="Reconciling modern science and old catholic traditions"></head><body><p>It is most important I start writing this review by stating that I do not read Dan Brown's books.  I saw film "Da Vinci Code" and was suprised that most viewers were commenting on Tom Hunks' haircut.  This time around his haircut is in much better shape.  Also this film is set in Vatican and Rome and many of the beauties of the area make film so much more appealing to the audiences.  Premise is interesting - scientists in Cern, Geneva are searching for the antimatter.  If proven to exist, this will be a basic particle from which universe was created.  Is it possible to reconcile this scientific "proof" (in real life anti-matter is not discovered yet) with the old traditions of christian faith (Catholic faith in particular).<br /><br />The inconvenience of the situation is that the pope has died and the new pope is not selected yet.  In a situation where there is no appointed leader of the 1 billion faithful Catholics around the world, power struggle is imminent between Vatican's police, security and priests placed in temporary power of the Holy Seat.  I loved the beauty of the city of Rome with its architectural delights and catacombs.  If not taken too seriously, this is a cool thriller to watch on one's night off.</p></body></html>

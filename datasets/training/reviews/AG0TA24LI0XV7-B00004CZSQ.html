<meta name="summary" content="Does Not Live Up to its Reputation. Practically a Comedy Film"></head><body><p>I felt two stars was harsh so I give it three, although that's being rather kind. Before I watched "Suspiria" I had read a lot of things about it-- how good it is, how scary. Well, it wasn't. At least not for me. To some people this may be a frightening and effective horror film. Loud, annoying music and the overuse of vivid colors do not make a brilliant horror movie.<br /><br />This tale of an American girl arriving at a European ballet academy and discovering its sinister secrets is interestingly and strangely executed but it may leave viewers perplexed and nonplussed. (As it did me!) The best thing in this film is the first murder. It's truly over the top and operatic. But the film overall lacks a lot in substance, scares and story. For example: Maggots? What was the point of that, plotwise? There was none. And I had to stifle giggles when I saw the bat on a string, and when I heard the headmistress snoring. Not scary. I know "Suspiria" has many admirers. But maybe they saw the movie without hearing all the grandiose hype beforehand.<br /><br />So I would suggest that it's worth renting to see this film that is on so many of the 'Greatest Horror Movies' lists. You may find yourself, like I was, wondering where the real horror was. Personally I'd rather watch a truly scary 1970's horror movie like "Black Christmas" or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".<br /><br />Much of this movie comes off as truly laughable, unfortunately. I don't think that was the intention.</p></body></html>

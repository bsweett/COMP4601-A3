Pan & scan butchery was equally ugly, but Elite's 1.33:1 release and all of the VHS editions of identical formatting that preceded it were surely more accurate presentations of this movie, which was shot in 1.37:1. That aside, this is a quality disc. It's unsightly, but that's how it was shot - on outmoded Arriflex 16mm cameras. However, I can't deny that this sounds great; the remastered soundtrack was tidied up just enough to enhance its clarity, but not so much that anything was significantly changed.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell narrates one of the disc's two commentary tracks; Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert voice the other. Campbell's commentary is far more fun: implementing his prodigious memory, wit and charm, The Chin provides an impressive amount of information pertaining to the movie's cast, crew and production, and his narration is as amusing as it is informative. The Raimi/Tapert track is a bit slower; while these two longtime partners are frequently very funny and offer the viewer some curious insights, they're too often at a loss for words and lack the charisma for this sort of voice-over. Also, the production of their track is middling, at best - an ambulance or police siren can be heard in the background at one point.<br /><br />10+ minutes of outtake footage serves as a blooper reel in portions. While some of the accidents and quirks of this compiled reel are hilarious, they also indicate the exhaustion of this movie's famously rigorous shoot.<br /><br />While the included theatrical trailer is pleasantly kitschy, the TV spots are especially fun; the repeated tagline of "They got up on the wrong side of the grave!" always makes me giggle.<br /><br />An image gallery consisting of film stills and scanned movie posters is included, as are brief bios of Campbell, Raimi and Tapert. Paired with the trailers, these are nice materials with which the viewer can wind down after watching the movie. A French audio track is also available (yes, it's fun for riffing).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="VICHY MOROCCO, 1941..."></head><body><p>As time goes by, no film equals the popularity of this indisputable classic.  In quintessential roles, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are former lovers reunited in wartorn Casablanca... Rick's place is a rendezvous for every crook and refugee in Casablanca: Bogey is the cynical cafe owner who lives by his own moral code and sticks his neck out for &quot;no one&quot;.  Bergman, as the beautiful wife of Resistance leader Paul Henried, finds herself torn between two lovers when she reenters Bogey's life...The film's GREAT success lies in the inimitable pairing of its two stars, a thoroughly romantic story line, terrific humour and numerous moments of genuine suspence.  Of course, that great ending helps, too!  Studio filmmaking from the 1940's didn't come any better than this, and director Curtiz masterfully handled the action, comedy and romance.  Nearly stealing the picture is Claude Rains as a &quot;poor, corrupt officer&quot; who as a Nazi puppet soon discovers &quot;the beginning of a beautiful friendship&quot;.</p></body></html>

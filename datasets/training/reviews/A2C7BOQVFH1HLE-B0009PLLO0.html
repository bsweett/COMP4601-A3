<meta name="summary" content="Closer to History Than Most Hollywood Epics And Overall An Enjoyable Film in Bluray!"></head><body><p>I guess it's a blessing I didn't watch any of the prior releases with this the Final Cut being my first viewing of the film but still it is clear to me that Oliver Stone is no Ridley Scott or even David Lean and so this film suffers somewhat from Stone's heavily documentary-like approach to film making.  At times I felt like I was watching a very, very long History Channel documentary and yet I have to say that I didn't find the film to be as bad as many other reviewers here apparently do.  I do agree with those who say that a lot of Alexander's important exploits are not showcased but instead are glossed over through Ptolemy's narratives but in fairness to Stone it would probably take 3 four-hour long movies to portray them all and at least the incredible defeat of Darius using the brilliant technique that is still taught in most military schools is shown here with at least for me irritating subtitles which only makes it feel even more like a History Channel documentary but overall I feel that once you get used to Stone's style of storytelling which is unlike most similar epics that we have seen from other directors like Kubrick, Scott or Lean this film while not perfect is still very good and engaging.  I found myself forced to concentrate and to pay attention throughout to catch the flow given the frequent flashbacks and jumping around and as such I didn't really feel the length of the film having so immersed myself in it.<br /><br />Story aside at least the picture and sound qualities were very good and although the special feature documentaries aren't that entertaining at least we finally get Alexander in the form that Stone was best able to deliver.  In trying to show the human side and to explain what makes him tick, Stone has succeeded in emphasising that aspect albeit having to sacrifice the more exciting fighting scenes.<br /><br />Not for everyone but it's probably the best that Stone could have done.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A strong action film , forgetting the other weak points"></head><body><p>No one is likely to give Mr Stallone a Best Actor Oscar .<br />However, one has to give him credit as a writer and as a person who knows what his audience wants from him in playing certain character types - after all, he's acting to be successful .<br /><br />The film does make other valid points about returning war veterans, but its main focus is the action angle .<br /><br />Sly plays off Brian Dennehy (the town policeman) very well and the tension begins to build up early in the piece as a result .<br /><br />If you are looking for an action film that is not for the kids , then you could do worse than this .<br />Don't look any deeper into it than you should and you may find you enjoy it .<br />A film for the guys mainly - with more drama than bloodshed.<br /><br />Update as of Jan 2010: I have bought the American Blu Ray edition and would like to advise that it is region free. If you are elsewhere in the world, this disc is worth picking up due to the picture quality and the worthwhile supplements on it - it is very good value. The version sold in Australia offers only the film and a different interview with Mr Stallone.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="No gimmick - the real thing"></head><body><p>I resisted watching this film. At first I assumed it was a gimmick: a mainstream movie featuring "breakthrough" love scenes between gay men. Then I thought it would be too serious and depressing, with pain and misery on all sides. I was wrong on both counts, and Brokeback turns out to be the best movie of the year.<br /><br />But I wasn't completely wrong. It is a breakthrough film, and there is pain and misery, but the quality of the story, the script, and the acting rise above everything else and come across as true, compelling, and universal. Brokeback is not about gay love; it's not about forbidden love; it's not about star-crossed love. It's about accepting people for who they are and the joy of a true bond of love.<br /><br />I thought the love scenes might be a little off-putting, but they were genuinely touching. For Ennis and Jack, it wasn't just about sex; more important was the emotional freedom and trust they allowed each other, so they could open up to happiness rather than suffer in loneliness. Affection was easier for Jack, and it was especially heart-warming to see Ennis emerge from his shell.<br /><br />Brokeback is a bittersweet tale of the redeeming power of love, as well as the sometimes desperate struggle for love and against loneliness.</p></body></html>

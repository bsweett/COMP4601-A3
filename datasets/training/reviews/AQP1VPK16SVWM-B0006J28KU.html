<meta name="summary" content="Mann reinvents the police drama with "Heat""></head><body><p>Inspired by a true story that occurred in 1964, Michael Mann's "Heat" reinvents the police action drama in the story of two men on opposite sides of the law who have respect for each other but, ultimately, must face off because of their roles in society. One a police officer named Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) the other a thief named Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) find they are flip sides of the same coin. McCauley hopes to pull off one big last score. His philosophy of life reflects that of a great thief; don't become attached to anything in life so that you can walk away. Pursued by an obsessed Hanna, he's driven only by the work and pushes his family away and pushes his men to capture McCauley before that last score goes down.<br /><br />A brilliant crime thriller where Mann reinvents the genre inverting the clich&eacute;s of the genre, the secret to "Heat" is the compelling story of duality that drives the characters and Mann's storytelling style and unconventional narrative that allows audiences to identify with both sides of the conflict. Stylish with rich visuals "Heat" captures Mann at the top of his game. "Heat" was, in fact, a remake of a film that Mann made for TV (as a possible pilot for a series). When producer Art Linson read the script he encouraged Mann to produce the original screenplay the way it was meant to be done with a top notch cast.<br /><br />Using the same transfer as last year's bare bones release, "Heat" looks positively beautiful. Mann's compositions and use of light and shadow immediately pull you into this urban tale of rivals on the opposite side of the law. It appears that this is the same anamorphic transfer that was done for the 1999 single disc release of the film. As with the previous edition the blacks darker than black coffee and the colors are solid. The only thing new here are the extensive extras and Michael Mann's commentary track. The audio makes nice use of the surround sound format placing sound effects all around the room where appropriate.<br /><br />A full disc of extras accompanies the film. Featuring 1 documentary divided into five parts which can be viewed in segments or all together, the first "The Making of Heat" features interviews with Mann and others from the production cast and crew discussing how Mann originally envisioned "Heat" (then called "L.A. Takedown") as the pilot for a TV series. The TV movie that Mann made in 1989 was an abridged version of the final script which, ultimately, became "Heat".  Mann had just completed writing "The Jericho Mile" (a TV movie) but no one was likely to approve him directing a major motion picture with the scope suggested by the script. Producer Art Linson read the complete screenplay that Mann had completed and told him bluntly, that it needed to be a feature film. Mann got his first choice for both major roles; both Pacino and De Niro agreed to do the film from the moment they were asked. Pacino discusses that his amped up take on his character was created because he envisioned that Hanna was on cocaine using it to keep him going so he could reach his objective of capturing McCauley. Pacino points out that Hanna is "a hunter"  and Mann states that he's "addicted" to complete the journey not so he can reach the end but just for the joy of catching the bad guy. In "Crime Stories"  the actors and production crew discuss how "Heat" has elements of a Greek tragedy as these two characters move towards their collision with no way out. Mann was interested in looking at the lives outside the story for each of these characters giving them depth and background.<br /><br />"Pacino and De Niro in Conversation" discusses the legendary showdown between Pacino and De Niro who meet together on screen for the first time. These two charismatic characters meet briefly in the film and that's the power of their meeting;  delaying their screen time creates tension. Both generate dramatic sparks on screen even though it's a low key conversation as they share their nightmares and their dreams. "Return to the Scene of the Crime" features the location manager and associate producer who discovered the locations for the film to revisit them and discuss how they found some of the unusual settings for the film.<br /><br />Mann's involving and intelligent commentary track really makes this worth getting by itself. While the documentaries are pretty good, nothing can beat Mann's insightful comments whether it be on Pacino's performance (and the background on the character that we never see but know from the actor's superb take on Hanna) to De Niro's meticulous working methods. It's one of the best solo commentary tracks I've heard.<br /><br />Sporting the same anamorphic widescreen transfer as the previous bare bones release from last year, the extras are what make "Heat" worthwhile. Mann's intelligent commentary and the second disc filled with documentaries and 11 deleted scenes make this worth picking up. My only complaint is that I wish the film had been released with a "L.A. Takedown" as a third disc. This would have made this the ultimate "boxed" set of a classic film. Well worth owning with incredible performances, strong extras and a detailed & thoughtful commentary from director Mann.</p></body></html>

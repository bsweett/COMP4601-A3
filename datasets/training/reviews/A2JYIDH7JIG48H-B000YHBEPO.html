<meta name="summary" content="Mission:  Typical"></head><body><p>Mission: Impossible III is definitely for Tom Cruise fans, with plenty of captions such as "Berlin, Germany," and "Rome, Italy." The rest of us, who already know a bit of geography, can skip it.  The story has nothing new or unpredictable - in fact they show a scene from the end of the movie at the beginning, so you know exactly where it's going.  The bad guys gathering in the Vatican, and the "good" guys breaking in to it, is an insulting implication to catholics.  That's all my criticism; on the plus side the movie is a diversion with action, special effects, stunts, and explosions enough to keep it going and earn 3 stars.  But personally I'd be just as satisfied to go see a new theatrical release of some of the old TV episodes with Peter Graves, which would save a fortune and probably present a more intellligent story.</p></body></html>

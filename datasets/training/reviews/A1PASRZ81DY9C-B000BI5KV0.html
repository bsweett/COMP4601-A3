It is a warm, touching, and moving story about the survival of the penguins which is a very cute story. I am let down by the idea of inserting the computer animation work for the underwater scenes. Moreover, I felt the movie was kind of slow at times. Nevertheless, it's a fascinating story about the behavior of animals, and thanks to the narration in clearing up the actions of the penguins for the audience. It is well worth my time, so it richly deserved the Academy Award for Best Documentary. All in all, I would have gladly picked March of the Penguins over Crash for the Best Picture of 2005.</p></body></html>

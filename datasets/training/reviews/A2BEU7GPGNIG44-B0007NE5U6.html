At the beginning of the film, Bridget is at work totally on cloud 9 after a fantastic shagadellic session with her boyfriend. The shag session was so fantastic that the next day at work she has a shag flashback and decides to call him at work to tell him how absolutely fab he looks in the buff. She then realizes that she has paid him this compliment on speaker phone. Bridget has one mishap after another and this comedy will keep you laughing. Fans of the first Bridget Jones movie won't be disappointed in this sequel that is just as funny. The comedy in the film is slapstick and it does get annoying at times to see Bridget repeatedly make a fool out of herself but fans of the underdog heroine will be pleased with this film. Will Bridget find true love with Mark Darcy? Or does Daniel Cleaver hold the key to her heart? Or will she find true love at all? You have to watch the movie to find out.<br /><br />The DVD itself has some pretty cool extras. You have the option to watch the film with the quiz on or off. The bonus features are separated into three sections-"Daniel's Hotel Room," "Bridget's Desk," and "Mark's Law Office." In Daniel's hotel room are the extras, "Fight" and "Who's Your Man Quiz?" "Fight" is commentary from cast members talking about the fight scene in the first movie and the sequel. "Who's Your Man Quiz?" is a fun interactive quiz. In Bridget's desk are the option to watch the feature film with director commentary and the option to watch deleted scenes with introductions. In the "Mark's Law Office" section is a featurette titled "Mark and Bridget Forever," and an interview titled, "Bridget Jones interviews Colin Firth." This is interesting because Renee Zellweger interviews Colin Firth in character. Colin is in street clothes and they are talking about "The real Colin Firth," not Mark Darcy. They talk about his filming "Pride and Prejudice," among other things. The final featurette is titled, "Lovely London." In this feature they discuss how computer generation is used in filming some of the exterior shots.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="First The Cave, now this!"></head><body><p>I don't get it.  The Cave got 2.5 stars overall on Amazon.  I liked it.  AVP is getting ripped on and I liked it.  First of all fans should have had their expectations very, very low when they heard Paul W.S. Anderson was directing.  I didn't really like Alien, but if you were a big fan of that and Aliens you should have known that this movie wasn't going to have great acting or a good plot.  If you take AVP for what it is, its pretty fun to watch.<br /><br />Now, yes I know.  It kinda takes any scare away that the Predators and the Aliens had.  I thought that when the girl and the Predator were outside they were gonna start kissing or something.  Also some of the parts of the fight scenes did make you unintentionally laugh.  But thats the director they have.<br /><br />This movie could have been a more horror-like movie like Alien, but the director chose to make it a lot more action oriented.  Was that a bad idea?  No.  Would this have been a better movie with a different director?  Probably(Unless they got Uwe Boll!  Give me Anderson any day over him)  Is the acting subpar?  Yes.  Is it fun to watch Predators and Aliens fighting to the death?  Heck Yes!  Does the movie do what movie are supposed to do, which is entertain?  Yes.  So therefore this is not a bad movie.  If your not a big fan of Alien you'll probably enjoy this movie a lot more, I know I did!<br /><br />Oh, they are making AVP 2.  Filming starts this September and it will be directed by.......UWE BO....No, its not that bad.  Its gonna be directed by two brothers.  It will be their directorial debut.  I say better than Anderson.  The title is<br /><br />AVP 2:  Survival of the fittest.</p></body></html>

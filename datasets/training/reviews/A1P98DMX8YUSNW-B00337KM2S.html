<meta name="summary" content="Book is way better, but this is ok"></head><body><p>The novel, by Walter Kirn, is a far better artistic experience than what they made it into here: a feel good flick about the importance of family. The novel is mostly interior monologue by the incessant traveler played well by George Clooney as a corporate hatchetman. I guess they needed more of a plot, of course, to make the film work better. This is an adult drama. No violence, no shoot em ups. Not for everyone, only those with a brain.</p></body></html>

This film is very close to capturing the spirit of the original TV series. The TV series was about almost limitless space travel into far off worlds searching out life forms and strong on deep character interactions of the crew based upon this trek into space. This film reverts back to the central theme of characters facing the unknown and is complimented by magnificent special effects giving the film a realistic quality not seen up to that time. Jerry Goldsmith's rich score enhanced the human drama as the crew came into contact with a vast life entity approaching earth. This film was brilliantly directed by Robert Wise but I still prefer the original version released to the theaters over this special edition.</p></body></html>

"Huh," they say.  "It FEELS like a Thursday."  Sometimes the "feel" of time throws us a little off whack, us wandering through Tuesdays that feel like Fridays, or trying to wrap our minds around the ambiguous dreariness of Sunday afternoons.  "Time is an illusion," Douglas Adams once wrote.  "Lunchtime doubly so."<br /><br />Screenwriter Bill Kelly was probably inspired by similar ideas of time when he wrote "Premonition," a thriller starring Sandra Bullock as Linda, a woman who keeps waking up on the wrong day.  At the beginning of the film, she learns that her husband has died in a car accident, but the next day, she opens her eyes to him lying in bed next to her.  And the next day he's dead.  Then he isn't.  Linda, understandably, is confused.<br /><br />You will be, too.  The script doesn't bother explaining why Linda is "unstuck in time." (I quote the recently deceased Vonnegut's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385333846">Slaughterhouse-Five</a>; the movie share's that book's ambition, but certainly not its skill or import)  There's a brief (and laughably cliched) scene where Linda, seeking answers, visits a priest who offers the standard, inoffensive and nondenominational advice that she must have faith "in something beyond yourself."  Linda leaves the church, sporting the same expression she utilizes throughout the whole movie: dull consternation.<br /><br />It's just as well; given the movie's themes, she should've visted a Calvinist.  There's a lot of hooey here about fate and determinism (hard plot points NOT to bring up when you're talking about characters who can see into the future; see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JL78">Minority Report</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780631684">Final Destination</a>), but all this movie really amounts to is watching Linda try desperately to makes sense of all of the inconsistencies that you yourself will be mulling over by the time the credits close.  Because she leaps forward and then back like a kid on a time-travelling swing set, she must make sense of what has happened and what will.  The film ties some things together (the appearance of Lithium in her medicine cabinet, strange cuts on her daughter, and a dead bird in the yard), but the jagged timeline makes all of it hard to comprehend.  Even harder to understand is how Linda herself fits into the whole thing.  Does she change anything?  Can she change anything?  SHOULD she change anything?<br /><br />It's a big mess.  A great big mess.  The preponderance of plot holes (which could conveniently be sewn up with a little long-shot rationalizing) is made worse by the emotional monotony of the film.  Not only does Linda teeter on an unoriginal chasm of madness, but she's teased over the edge by a slew of characters straight out of Central Casting.  Say hello to the Patronizing Mother, the Amiable-but-Unhelpful Best Friend, the Precocious Daughters, the Sinister Shrink, the Emotionally Unavailable Husband, the Strange Other Woman Standing Behind a Distant Tree During a Gloomy Funeral Who Suddenly Bolts when She is Spotted by the Dead Man's Wife!<br /><br />There's a message in Linda's madness, true to form, and just like the characters, it pops up prepackaged and ready for sale.  It is, in fact, the final insult in a movie filled with smug, hallucinatory meandering.  I'm not talking about the climax, where all of the unstuck days finally coalesce in a chubby ball of fire.  I'm talking about, literally, the last shot of the movie, a screen-scene dripping with so much vague and vapid hope, I'm surprised the Kindly Old Priest character isn't in it.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Sandra Bullock (she was my first on-screen crush, actually), but she is lost in the morass of this mind-bender of a movie.  One gets the feeling that her Linda could've benefited from something as simple as a Page-A-Day calendar.  The rest of the movie, though, needs a lot more help.</p></body></html>

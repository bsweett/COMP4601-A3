<meta name="summary" content="A new kind of criminal for a old-fashioned world"></head><body><p>In a wide open country region where an old fashioned Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) the sheriff of this country region in West Texas is struggling to catch on to the rising crime rates and the breeding of a new criminal.<br /><br />"No Country for Old Men" is centered on Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin). While hunting one afternoon, he stubbles across a drug scene gone bad. There are several dead men and dogs, along with two million dollars. Moss decides to take the money back to his trailer home. Later that night while he is thinking about what he saw, he decides to bring water to a man who was still alive. While doing this, Moss gets chased by some men in a truck. He escapes the men, and returns to his trailer home to get the money and send his wife to her mother's house. Moss checks into a motel in the next county, where he stashes the money in his motel rooms vent.<br />Meanwhile Hitman Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is hired to recover the money. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is on the case, but is always one step behind Moss and Chigurh.<br /><br />The fascinating aspect of "No Country for Old Men" are the two themes in the film, which are the cat and mouse like game between Moss and Chigurh, and the Character Tommy Lee Jones plays (Sheriff Ed Tom Bell). He is proud to be the sheriff, but knows he is falling behind the modern criminal.<br /><br />Directors Ethan and Joel Coen do a great job turning a novel into a good movie. The characters are well acted and the screenplay is well written.</p></body></html>

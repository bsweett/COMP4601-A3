Adam (Leigh Whannell) is a photographer; Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes, The Princess Bride) is a surgeon. Both men have no idea how they ended up in this room together. Nor how a dead body laying between them got there. In the dead body's hands are a gun and a micro-cassette tape player.<br /><br />They soon discover a micro-cassette tape in each of their pockets, and quickly uncover a creepy message that awaits them by their captor. The "jigsaw" killer has caught them: a psychopath who doesn't necessarily "kill" people, but helps them kill themselves . . . or survive by killing others.<br /><br />**********************************************************************<br /><br />The psychology surrounding the events is sound enough: the slow descent into suspicion of each other, the lack of external stimulation that leads to a decline in mental faculties, and the eventual near insanity that would insue if you found out you had to kill someone in order to save yourself and/or your loved ones. Do they deserve to die anymore than you do?<br /><br />Where this film fell a bit short was in acting and plot. The acting was subpar. Cary Elwes, who I absolutely LOVED in The Princess Bride, here comes off like an amateur (could be that they were pressed for time and money, filming on a budget of $1.2 million and in 18 days). Makenzie Vega, Elwes' wife in the film, was flat, uncharming, and a bore. As were the estimable Danny Glover (Grand Canyon), and Ken Leung (Rush Hour and Red Dragon).<br /><br />There were also enough plot holes to make this film resemble swiss cheese. There was the fact that the main antagonist turns out to be someone who could NEVER have pulled off such cases (mainly because he was deathly ill); Dr. Gordon was allowed to sit and watch the interrogation of a survivor of the Jigsaw Murderer (which NEVER would have happened if, as the film shows us, Dr. Gordon was an initial suspect); the "game" that is played out by this killer is given to the captives bit by bit, as if it were a simple video game and all you had to do to survive was to put the pieces together. But, what I didn't understand, is that if this psycho enjoyed watching people tear themselves or others apart, why would he give them a way out, with simple clues and instructions? Didn't make sense to me.<br /><br />For the horror fan, though, I'm sure this film will be coveted and hailed as a great film of 2004. For me, though, it's a pretty big disappointment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="KILL THEM ALL"></head><body><p>Despite the purposefully ambiguous "kill them all" message inserted into the script (more on that later), The Kingdom comes across as a very realistic action movie with delicate political and religious overtones.  Without extreme jingoism or political preaching, a picture of the Saudi Arabian kingdom - a possible metaphor for the Iraq war or Islam - is painted in which a culture clash between American FBI agents and oppositional Saudi officials is juxtaposed so that a common bond can be emotionally unearthed beneath the bloody rubble of a terrorist attack.<br /><br />In a post-9/11 environment - a world that has since discovered the majority of the hijackers' were Saudi - the once strong bond between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia has weakened under tension.  After a brutal terrorist attack on ARAMCO civilians playing softball, several FBI agents - Ronald Fleurry (Foxx), Grant Sykes (Cooper), Janet Mayes (Garner), Adam Leavitt (Bateman) - are sent to the Middle East to cooperate with initially resistant local officials and find the responsible party in a small five-day window.  While clue hunting, respect between the various investigators is forged, as societal differences are overcome and eventually eschewed because of common bonds, similar foes, and shared emotions - particularly between FBI team lead Fleurry and Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Barhom).<br /><br />From top to bottom this movie exudes realism.  The location is authentic; the debris smolders; the locals look confused, terrified, and angry.  The direction is crisp, keeping the viewer on the edge of the seat as soon as it is revealed the hunt is on for a terrorist explosives expert.  Action for the entire second half of the movie.  And the ending?  Woo, the ending is crazy.  A frenzy of gun-play with automatic fire ringing ears, the wet thwop of bodies receiving lead injections, and speaker-rumbling bass accompanying every bomb or RPG.<br /><br />The script by Matthew Michael Carnahan is borderline genius.  How representatives of two foreign governments can come together so quickly, to bond so thoroughly, to display such shared emotion, all while suffering through nearly unspeakable blood and violence, and not feel forced or rushed, is incredibly complimentary for the script and actors who made the situations and relationships so believable.  While somewhat unbelievable at times, its flawless execution makes otherwise noticeable gaffs (Jennifer Garner's outfits in Saudi Arabia would have been frowned upon) disappear.<br /><br />-----SPOILER (kinda)-----<br />I believe the phrase "Kill them all" spoken by the terrorist at the end is what he sees as proactive guidance in reference to his enemies, to kill them simply for who they are.  Conversely, I believe the phrase, when spoken by Jamie Foxx's character, is meant as a vow of revenge in the name of justice, to kill those who have already committed murders and atrocities.  In my view, the two are unequal, and serve as the primary reason for the tensions and dangers that currently exist.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></body></html>

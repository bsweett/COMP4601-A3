<meta name="summary" content="Purposeless fiction. Great cinematic artwork"></head><body><p>Dizzying two hours were spent on this nonsense fiction. The main reason for my staying to the end of the movie was the neat and sophisticated work of art.<br /><br />A university for magic? As if the author could not occupy herself with more constructive fiction that betters our troubled world!!  Phony professors packaging memories in bottles? Though the bottles, the lab setups, the school landscape, and the old chemistry books all looked impressive and real, their use was put to no good cause.<br /><br />Assuming that the work of fiction should not be held to the test of logical reasoning, it should at least serve some constructive goal. Here, the story of the whole movie is loose and fragmented stream of imagery that could only be seen in bad dreams.<br /><br />Even bad dreams have some sort of logical connection between their events, which this movie completely lacked. Neither the dizzying fiction stretches our imagination, not did it conclude in relieving a stressing desire.<br /><br />The only purpose of the movie in my opinion was getting graphic artists busy is a jobless world.</p></body></html>

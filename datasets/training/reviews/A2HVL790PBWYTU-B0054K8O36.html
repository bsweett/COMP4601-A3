Still, someone's going around passing himself off as our favorite pirate, recruiting sea hands for a run at Ponce de Leon's mythical Fountain of Youth. And this poser isn't the only one after the key to life eternal. The Spanish are curious. The British are curious because the Spanish are curious. Edward Teach, a.k.a. the notorious pirate and dark sorcerer Blackbeard, is another buttinski. And, the honest-to-gosh real Captain Jack Sparrow, who had just about given up his own quest for the Fountain of Youth, reinvigorates himself to the cause. He has a map and all.<br /><br />PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES is a hell of a long title, and it's a fairly long movie. I liked it enough that I'm recommending it. But I didn't enjoy it as much as the previous three films (including the way over-the-top AT WORLD'S END). Turns out, I missed Kiera Knightley and Legolas something fierce. Turns out, Jack Sparrow is better served when he's coming at you sideways, when he's not featured as so obviously the central character. Partly, it's that, at this stage, we know that Jack Sparrow is a good guy, no matter that he walks like a silly ponce and that he sports sinister gold teeth and heavy eyeliner. By now, it's difficult for the film to employ trickeration on a savvy audience. And Jack Sparrow loses a bit of something when you know without a doubt that he's an honorable scoundrel. Even if he's still peculiar in his habits and methods.<br /><br />Saving the ever reliable Geoffrey Rush, Johnny Depp has no actor with enough of a presence for him to effectively bounce off from, and right there I guess I just elevated Orlando Bloom's acting chops. The new characters don't resonate for me, not Penelope Cruz's winsome pirate's daughter (and Sparrow's old flame), not Ian McShane's cursed Blackbeard, and certainly not that actor who plays the uncharismatic missionary/clerk/all around boredom-on-legs.<br /><br />Hell, I even miss that short, bald pirate and his mate with the wooden eye.<br /><br />No surprise, the film is visually stunning; it looks very good. It's loud, bombastic, and drawn out. The f/x and stunts are rather spectacular. As ever, Jack Sparrow's antics are to be appreciated. I particularly liked the scene in the British king's palace, in which the movie audience sees a captive Jack, in delightful off-the-cuff fashion, plan and stage his eventual escape, a key component of which is that chandeliered dessert.<br /><br />The film tries to distract you with plot candy such as lost magical chalices and mermaid's tears, and zombies and a Keith Richards cameo. But it all feels like filler. There's something missing from the core of the story. And Jack Sparrow, unruffled and odd and improvisational, is still best when utilized as misdirection. But, for that to be, you need someone else to also focus on. That missionary dullard sure can't cut the mustard or capture big screen interest. Which leaves Jack shouldering the hero tropes. Here, he's clearly the hero and central protagonist and even the lead in the love story. Jack, you've gone all domesticated, yo. It doesn't quite suit you.<br /><br />I will say that Astrid Berges-Frisbey, who plays the mermaid Syrena, is a stunner. I do challenge the laws of gravity which always seemed to place her hair in such a strategic way that Disney is able to maintain its PG-13 rating.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="David Fincher makes a spectacular return"></head><body><p>David Fincher has proven himself to be nothing less than a master of the moody, star filled thriller, and Zodiac is no different.  Fincher's first since taking a long break after Panic Room, Zodiac revolves around a trio of characters who all do their own work as the Zodiac killer both terrorizes and puzzles them.  The first department that Zodiac succeeds in is with the casting, which includes Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith (the cartoonist who wrote the book the film is derived from), the great Robert Downey Jr. as crime writer Paul Avery, and Mark Ruffalo as cop David Toschi; all of whom find themselves brought together as the body count rises.  The rest of the cast features Chloe Sevigny, Brian Cox, Elias Koteas, Donal Logue, and Dermot Mulroney; all of whom in smaller but nevertheless pivotal roles that could have been wasted by any other actors.  Fincher himself is in fine form as his look of the film is grimy and reflective of the era without being dated, and the cinematography and art direction are simply brilliant.  The only real flaw with Zodiac is that the film is overlong and has no real ending (then again, anyone familiar with the crimes should take this as no surprise), but in every other department, Zodiac is a winner.  All in all, Zodiac is a mainstream serial killer film unlike that of which you may have seen before, and for fans of true crime or Fincher, it is definitely worth checking out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Over the Top, Even for Michael Bay!"></head><body><p>This movie was over the top even for Michael Bay!  Reprising their roles from the first film, I found myself having to sit through a soap opera of Sam Witwicky's parents crying over their son leaving for college - at least until their kitchen utensils come to life!<br /><br />Then we have Sam unable to say I love you to his air-headed, hot girlfriend, played vacuously by Megan Fox.  She looks great but hardly has any lines.  One of the robots said it well when he said she looks hot but is not that smart.<br /><br />The little transformer truck robot is spying to the Decepticons.  It's obviously running around in her garage and no one notices?  The Autobots' rendition of slum kids with the Black ghetto accents will probably offend some viewers.<br /><br />Besides the dropped "coming of age" storyline with the ridiculous antics of Sam's roommate and screaming girlfriend who just wants to have her first online date, we have a decent bit of history of the Optimus Prime's group, who deal with the red-tape of government - run by a lackey who gets his quite nicely I might add.<br /><br />Action:  The movie forgets about a decent script and plot for some Rockem Sockem action with lots of alien robot fights.  Yes, lots of explosions - well, it is a Michael Bay film after all.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Outside of learning about the invasion of these `Bots and how they've been around us since the dawn of Time, and some incredibly impossible athletic actions by Sam, who almost dies in the attempt upon the deserts of Egypt, it's really not much of a film.  The first film was much better.<br /><br />Rental.<br /><br />Suggest:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060FXBNM">Transformers Trilogy (Transformers / Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen / Transformers: Dark of the Moon) [Blu-ray</a>]</p></body></html>

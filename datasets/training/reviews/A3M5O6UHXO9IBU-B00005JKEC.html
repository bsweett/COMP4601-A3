Come back tomorrow and we'll play the game again" said contempo. "I can't put my trousers back on with these cuffs. Where's the key?" I protested. "On the floor under the desk. Now get on your knees, slave" he snarled. There's no escaping contempo when you put on a DVD that's criminal. You immediately get the knock. I don't mean counterfeit, I'm talking about the plot. The net conclusively proves that when whitey gets up close and personal with Mr African-American, he will pay close attention to the floor. In fact, a mere flick of the wrist is enough. Not so in this Hollywood movie, of course. After getting what can only be described as a comprehensive going over from Denzel Washington for quarter of an hour, you would think Ethan Hawke would be off for an urgent appointment with a life support machine. Eschewing the usual coma, Ethan lives up to his surname by launching himself off a roof straight on the bonnet of Denzel's car. Then with a bone structure last attributed to Reed Richards, he proceeds in his police work seemingly none the worse for wear. The only film worse than this is 'Dark Blue' with a criminal performance from Kurt Russell. As Ray 'contemporaneous notes' Lewis would say: "get your trousers on, you're nicked!" It's only if you're already wearing trousers that you've got to worry with contempo.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="[3.5]--Vaughn gets sole credit for comic relief"></head><body><p>Although Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau again team up for some of the comedic scenes, this movie is not a complete disappointment. If you like VV you may enjoy the first hour of this film; after that it descends into predictability, strained comedy, and gay stereotypes from the 80's.<br /><br />Vaughn gets sole credit for adding any substance to this film. And I do mean ANY. Vincent D'Onofrio, a good actor, is wasted in an inscrutable part, a deranged older sibling who runs the tourism business in Chicago with Vaughn. There are some awful scenes- REALLY awful, at the dinner table where Ann-Margret is also present.Judy Davis is a welcome diversion from this mess, but her cameo as an eccentric art gallery owner is not long enough. Aniston plays her usual self; which may be good or bad, depending on what you think of her personality. Joey Lauren Adams is also a one-dimensional character, trying to help her sister find Mr. Right.<br /><br />Apparently, the director did not want this to be construed as a "chick flick" so added Vaughn, and a few male characters, without developing the characters, or giving them any substance.There is a brief scene with the "Old 97's" in concert, Vaughn has a few dramatic moments, and the plot could have worked, but the screenwriter must have been under a time limit, or creatively challenged.<br /><br />Breaking the mold of an already faulty genre does not an instant classic make. It just means it's an unusual addition to the faulty genre, rather than an exception. And Reed should have paid closer attention to the romantic comedies that Linklater (Before Sunrise), Crowe (Jerry Maguire) and Smith (Chasing Amy) made following their teen flicks. The devil is in the dialogue, and more attention should have been paid attention to it. Oh, and casting the right people for the parts, rather than the flavours of the month. That really helps too. Overall, this film is a slight disappointment which could actually have worked, had there been any creative thought put into it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Contemporary fairy tale"></head><body><p>I guess during hard economic times, people need to have any hope, so fairy tale(s) like the one told in this movie seems to be a good start.  Set in India, story covers the life of a young man of muslim descent who along with his older brother becomes an orphan at early age.  Without parents, they do whatever it takes to survive in a world.  Younger one, Jamal becomes a contestant on indian version of the show "Who wants to be a millionaire?".  Show seems to be the only way to conquer poverty an destitute for a young man with no education or any other prospects.<br /><br />When his answers lead him on top of the game, he arouses suspicions of the show host of being a cheat and impostor.  Jamal is kidnapped by a local police nad subjected to brutal interrogation in attempt to find out how he cheated,  It is during this interrogation that becomes obvious that events in this young man's life seem to have led to his knowledge on all answers to his questions.<br /><br />Good music, solid acting (Dev Patel is over the top, but Freida Pinto is natural), but not so convincing story. I still do not get it how this movie got all the Oscars this year.  It just was not all that good.  If you really want to see a touching movie about child exploitation, I recommend you see Emir Kusturica's "Time of the Gypsies" movie.</p></body></html>

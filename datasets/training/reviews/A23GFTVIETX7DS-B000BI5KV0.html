<meta name="summary" content="An Exceptional Study of the Emperor Penguin"></head><body><p>When this documentary about the life cycle of the Emperor penguin first debuted in limited distribution, no one expected it to capture the imagination of the viewing public.  On the surface, this story is about the drive of a species to reproduce, but the steady narration spoken by Morgan Freeman and the astonishing footage reveals something much more poignant:  love, dedication, determination, and a willingness to fight the odds for the survival of one's family.  It is this "humanity," the traits we recognize in ourselves, that brings this film out of the dispassionate nature film genre and into the realm of something much more raw and emotional.  Even the most hardened viewer will be touched by the disappointment, mourning, and desperation of this group of Antarctic birds that trek seventy miles every year under the harshest conditions on the planet to fall in love (yes, that's exactly what it looks like) and raise a single chick to maturity.<br /><br />With breathtaking cinematography and educational overview, this film lives up to, and even exceeds, National Geographic's high standards.</p></body></html>

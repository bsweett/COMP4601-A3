<meta name="summary" content="King Kong vs Godzilla - slasher movie style ! Freddy vs Jason is above average."></head><body><p>Sort of a gore fans' version of what King Kong vs Godzilla is to monster movie fans.<br />For what this movie is, a violent slasher movie of epic proportions - the meeting and greeting and beating of two slasher icons. Freddy vs Jason to me was really entertaining. That is all this is meant to do, it is for fans of the gore and slasher genre & watching these two bloody each other up. These movies don't need a heavy plot or deep characters or love interests, they are just for violence fans. Characters are just there to be fed to the real stars, Freddy and Jason. I enjoyed the blood bath fight scenes between the two and the action to me was satisfactory. As far as acting & plot - well these movies really aren't specializing in that aspect. These are for gore,violence & this case 2 horror icons going at it with a stab here and a slash there. Better than average in my opinion. I enjoyed this than most of the other Jason/Friday the 13th films and I am not really into the Elm Street series, but put the two together and I really liked it. The DVD is really a treat for this movie..well worth owning.</p></body></html>

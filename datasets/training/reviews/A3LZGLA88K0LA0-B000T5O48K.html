<meta name="summary" content="SENSELESS AND OVERWROUGHT"></head><body><p>Only the career defining performance from a dynamic Ashley Judd mskes this movie worthwhile.  Director William Friedkin's translation of the play by Tracy Lettis tries to instill suspense by fueling the paranoia of Judd and co-star Michael Shannon (in a very good performance).  If you were expecting a true horror movie, you will certainly be disappointed.  I had a hard time seeing Judd's descent into the paranoid woman -- her involvement with Shannon is deep but to fall so hard into the maelstrom of Shannon's dementia isn't grounded.  Harry Connick Jr. is pretty good too as Judd's abusive ex-husband, but overall I was disappointed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not the usual movie"></head><body><p>A great movie with a great cast of characters and actors.  I mention both because the script provides us with a great story concerning a collection of rogues, and the actors truly make these rogues memorable.  This film takes a crime drama and adds a twist.<p>As the story unfolds, the viewers, as well as the interrogating police, find themselves getting more and more enmeshed in the tale.<p>The work of Kevin Spacey in this movie is stellar.  He shares a very wide acting range with the audience.  Seeing his performance alone is worth the time to see the movie.<p>I would highly recommend seeing this movie.</p></body></html>

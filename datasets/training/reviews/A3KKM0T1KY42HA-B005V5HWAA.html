<meta name="summary" content="A Day in the Life of a Recovering Serial Killer"></head><body><p>"Hello. My name is Earl Brooks, and I'm an addict."<br /><br />Yes indeed. Mr. Brooks is an addict alright. But unfortunately what Mr. Brooks is addicted to isn't killing *him*...it's killing unsuspecting, innocent people.<br /><br />Kevin Costner is fabulous as Mr. Brooks. In Costner's last movie (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KF0GWW">The Guardian</a>) he was an instructor (reluctantly) at The Coast Guard Academy (teaching Ashton Kutcher); in Mr. Brooks he is being hunted by Kutcher's beau Demy Moore, and Costner has again been (reluctantly) put into an 'instructional' role.<br /><br />Instead of the traditional Hollywood approach of following the cops hunt for the serial killer, you're mainly with Mr. Brooks during his daily routines.<br /><br />Writer/Producer Bruce Evans takes the directorial reins for only his second time in 15 years, and the job that he did with Mr. Brooks just goes to show that you don't need a popular, long-time director to get a great movie.<br /><br />In Mr. Brooks there are terrific thrills. Excellent twists. And there's plenty of action. Some of the situations require a stretch of the imagination, but the acting by a great A-list company and the fast-paced story flow keep viewers from spending too much time deciding whether it's 100% believable or not.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks is one of the better, more entertaining movies that I've watched in 2007. Add it to your cart.</p></body></html>

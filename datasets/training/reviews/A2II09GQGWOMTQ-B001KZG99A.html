<meta name="summary" content="He Was Turned To Steel..........."></head><body><p>Actually...........he didn't turn to steel in a great magnetic field.<br />Nor did he travel time for the future of mankind.<br />Kind of like Spiderman I never really knew much about Iron Man.<br />So.............I tried to watch this with an open mind.<br />Ok, let's be brutally honest here. By the time I popped Iron Man into the DVD player I had just gotten home after being out with the co workers.<br />Iron Man got popped into the DVD player and I plopped down on the couch, not just tipsy, not just a little woozy. I mean, fall off the couch TANKED!!!<br />Vodka seems to affect how much I like movies.<br />And how did I like Iron Man in my drunken stupor?<br />I LOVED IT!!!!<br />I'm not a big fan of Downey Jr. but  I'll be darned if he didn't do an excellent job.<br />In the past I've been critical of overly long reviews and yet my most recent reviews should have been called novels instead.<br />So...............I'll keep it short.<br />What's good?<br />The acting, the script, the FX of course.<br />What's bad?<br />Not much really.<br />People may gripe about the negative Arab stereotyping and granted it is getting a tad old.<br />But that minor little complaint aside Iron Man was a blast to watch.<br />How many of you wanted to fly after watching this movie?<br />I sure did, but I could barely make it off the couch to the bathroom so flying probably wouldn't have been the best idea at that particular moment anyway.<br />Anyway.........Iron Man, loved it!!!<br />A great way to spend an evening and yet another movie I wish I had taken the time to see in the theater.<br />Vengeance from the grave, kills the people he once saved...............nobody wants him...............he just stares at the world.<br />Love the movie, love the song........who the hell were Sabbath singing about anyway???<br />Iron Man doesn't seem to do anything the song talks about?<br />Oh well.........<br />Iron Man?<br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />Iron Man lives agaaaaaaain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></body></html>

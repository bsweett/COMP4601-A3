<meta name="summary" content="The pitfalls of being self-absorbed and a catty backstabbing gopher"></head><body><p>I used to work for someone who was exactly like Meryl Streep's character Miranda Priestly (although it wasn't in a journalism setting, unfortunately), so I could relate to this movie all too well.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway's character of Andy Sachs was exactly the way I felt while working for this individual, and I could see myself living with my job the way Andy did with hers.  I felt like a new person when I finally quit that hellhole.<br /><br />I never did have the time for individuals such as the shallow and self-important people featured in the movie.  Everyone is out for #1, everyone is the boss, everyone is the only one who "gets it," and there's a tremendous amount of unnecessary backstabbing and cattiness that goes on.  And the ring leader of the circus (the head boss) just likes to see everyone jumpy and miserable (as Andy stated in a moment of frustration).<br /><br />Meryl Streep, as always, played a believeable mega-boss in Miranda Priestly.  She was so good that I had to remind itself it was just acting.  Anne Hathaway was her usual charming self.  She has worked very well with legendary actresses (who can actually act!) such as Streep and Julie Andrews and her movies with them are enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />"The Devil Wears Prada" is a great movie to show people the pitfalls of tossing aside everyone and everything that you know and love in your quest for number one - and how empty, lonely, and full of "drama" being at the top can be.  - Donna Di Giacomo</p></body></html>

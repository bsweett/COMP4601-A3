It is based on a son, a daughter, a mother and a father caught up in the whole virus affecting the world. My only complain and a big flaw in the film is the fact that the characters are not even allowed to grow on you. Before you know anything else, you find characters running and hiding. It's a bit too active and it seems that the director is trying too hard to create an impact.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later does create an impact, in the sense it is still a must watch film but there is nothing about the film that deserves recognition or respect. It tries to incorporate a whole lot in a space of way less than 2hours. A lot of readers/posters/critics on imdb.com wrote this is one of the best films they saw in 2007. I can see what they could have liked about this film but I must say, in my heart of hearts, it is quite underwhelming.<br /><br />Watch [...] and figure out how it had those 4minute action scenes. There were maybe 2 scenes in the film that made me jump from my seat. The film,overall, though would still remain disappointing. However, I would not like to pull you away from it. Watch it cause you might just like it or you might just end up finding I make sense to more than just myself.<br /><br />Try watching "[...]" - a good effort and it doesn't try to change the world. I eagerly await the follow up to this film, if any at all. I'll just keep my expectations low.</p></body></html>

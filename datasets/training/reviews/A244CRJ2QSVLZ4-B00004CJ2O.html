<meta name="summary" content="Happy Birthday Jason!!!"></head><body><p>On June 13, 2008, I celebrated Friday the 13th by watching the first Friday the 13th movie.  Over the ensuing weekend, I watched parts II through IV.  The first four, in my opinion, were the best of the series.  Together, they told an awesome story of an American icon that became a household name!<br /><br />  After watching "Friday the 13th," for what must have been at least the fifth time, I learned that Jason was actually born on June 13th.  Happy birthday Jason Voorhees!!!!  Your mom would've been proud of you if she hadn't lost her head at Crystal Lake!<br /><br />  I can understand why the Terror Trap (an excellent internet museum of classic horror) has "Friday the 13th" listed in their top ten of all time horror greats.  It revolutionized the slasher frenzy of the eighties.  Many directors were influenced by it.  "Friday the 13th" was sandwiched between "Halloween" and "Halloween II."  Because of "Friday the 13th," "Halloween II" had a much higher body count than the original.<br /><br />  What thrilled me the most about "Friday the 13th" is that the killer's face is never shown during the murders.  Only their legs and feet.  Now, after watching it again, it reminds me of the Italian gialli of the early seventies.  An Italian giallo (mystery) generally involved a black-gloved killer whose true identity is never revealed until the end of the film.  Specifically, it reminded me of Mario Bava's giallo, "Bay of Blood" (a.k.a. "Twitch of the Death Nerve") which involves a woods full of greedy relatives and associates killing one another for an inheritance.  Many of the death scenes were imitated in the Friday the 13th movies, especially the first two.  If you haven't seen "Bay of Blood," I recommend that you buy it from Anchor Bay since they have the best version.<br /><br />  "Friday the 13th" and its first three sequels are a must have for fans of slasher movies and Italian gialli.  After more than twenty-five years, it continues to scare me.<br /><br />  Like so many other fans, I can't wait for "Friday the 13th the Series" to be released on DVD.  I'm a little bit apprehensive about the remake scheduled for release on Friday, February 13, 2009, but I'll definitely see it.</p></body></html>

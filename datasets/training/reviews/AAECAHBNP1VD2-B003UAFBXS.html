IF ytou do, you'll probably laugh like hell. The thing  is that based on where it is storywise, the slower pacing is often necessary, as is the back story. Campbell and Davis are excellent, and the plot is off-the-wall enough to be captivating in an inexplicable way. The big problem is that once things really get going, the whle thing's over WAY too soon. This could've been a half-hour to 45 minutes longer easily, and it would've added a whole other dimension to things. There were also a few threads that could've been followed a bit more for a small subplot or two. Definitely worth it for the performances, but try to get a used or discounted copy.</p></body></html>

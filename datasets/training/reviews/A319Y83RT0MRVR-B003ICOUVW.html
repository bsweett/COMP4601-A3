It wasn't a terrible film, but one felt that there were just better things to do than sit there and watch this movie unfold. The CGI transformations from human into a werewolf were done really well though. Benedito Del Toro was barely passable in the leading role and caused the overall lack of interest in this viewer.</p></body></html>

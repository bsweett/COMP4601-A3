<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining despite a mediocre script and other problems"></head><body><p>If you can get through the rather tedious first half hour or so, Mr. and Mrs. Smith finds its legs and makes for plenty of entertaining action and adventure.  That first half hour can be pretty rough, though, as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie really seem to sleepwalk through their roles.  Doubtlessly, this is due in no small part to the nature of their characters, two highly-ranked assassins going through the motions of a normal husband and wife in order to hide their real jobs from one another.  I think it goes deeper than the script, though.  Jolie has always gone all out for her characters, but for quite a while I just didn't think she put her heart into this particular role - ironic, given the fact that she and Pitt began their little love affair during filming.  I have to admit that the whole real-life romantic triangle thing dampened my enjoyment of the film, to a certain degree.  For me, there's a definite ick factor in watching Mr. and Mrs. Smith, since in a sense you're watching a real-life adulterous affair play out right in front of your eyes.<br /><br />The plot is pretty basic and nothing we haven't seen before.  Girl meets boy, girl marries boy, girl and boy try to kill each other.  For the first six years of their marriage, John Smith (Pitt) and his lovely wife Jane (Jolie) are completely unaware that their partner is, like themselves, a high-level assassin.  How they go traipsing all over the world killing people and still manage to return in time for 7:00 dinner every night is just one of many questions the writer chose to blissfully ignore.  They really have little reason to suspect one another, though, because their suburban home lifestyle is exceedingly boring.  Whatever spark of romance they once shared, it's long gone by this point.  Everything changes, however, when they get in each other's way on separate missions centered on the same target.  Neither can afford to let the other blow his/her cover, so their respective agencies quickly pit them against one another.  Of course, things get a little more involved after that, but you can see where this whole thing is going.  Finally, once the Smiths stop being so painfully civil to one another, their characters finally begin to show signs of life.  Too many attempts to be funny during the heat of battle only reinforces the weakness of the entire script, however, leaving you unable to enjoy all of the mayhem and things that go boom as much as you think you should.  Sure, some of the dialogue is funny, but most of the time it just seems terribly contrived.<br /><br />With all of its explosions, big guns, and all-around violence, Mr. and Mrs. Smith should manage to satisfy those who just can't get enough movie mayhem, and Angelina Jolie - even though she's not at her best here - still makes any movie she's in worth watching.  Clearly, though, something is just missing here.  Thanks largely to a relatively weak script, Pitt and Jolie never really bring you in to their characters' world, which means you are never able to forget that you're watching a movie.  As a result, the film entertains but never really satisfies.  It's really a 3.5 star movie; I rounded my rating up to four stars because, despite its many weaknesses, the film did manage to entertain me.</p></body></html>

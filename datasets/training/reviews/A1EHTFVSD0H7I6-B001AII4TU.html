<meta name="summary" content="Huge Fans of the Twisted Fairy Tale Fun Will Still Enjoy 3"></head><body><p>I wish Amazon had 1/2 stars. This is a 3.5 in my book.<br /><br />I hesitated to buy or even rent Shrek 3. I'd read a review when it opened that suggested it fell very short of the other two. But I found a deal I couldn't pass up, and even if it was slightly amusing I thought it might produce a few giggles. If nothing else, the infamous Puss-in-Boots big-eyed, poor kitty stare was worth the price of Shrek 2.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I found much to enjoy. A twist on the traditional Puss-in-Boots eyes brought a smile. Prince Charming's dinner theater gig gone bad was another amusing scene.<br /><br />It's creative, well-written and still amusing. It would be impossible to produce a Shrek movie without relying on some of the tried and true Shrek and company gags. Magic gone wrong with funny results, of course. Princesses with attitude, only a few minutes worth and still watchable.<br /><br />A gentler Fiona and a slightly tamer Shrek are to be expected because people do grow and change, after all - it stands then that ogres might also. Donkey as a daddy plays.<br /><br />If you are a huge Shrek fan for the subtle and not-so-subtle twisted fairy tale moments and laughed out loud at Shrek 1 and 2 - I think it's safe to say you will enjoy Shrek 3.</p></body></html>

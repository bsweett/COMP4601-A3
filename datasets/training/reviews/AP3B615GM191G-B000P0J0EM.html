<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Best Book-To-Film Translation I've Ever Seen"></head><body><p>A few weeks ago, I finished Stephen King's novel "The Green Mile" and realized that I was about the only person on the planet who had not seen the film adaptation.  Upon viewing the 3-hour piece of work, I was amazed by the degree to which King's writing was able to be translated to the big screen (as opposed to, say, "Hearts In Atlantis", which left much to be desired).<br /><br />The plot of the film is exactly the same as that of the book, centering on a 1930s death row prison and the strange (paranormal?) events that transpired there.  All the actors are dead-on in their interpretation of King's characters, such as the inspired Paul Edgecombe (Tom Hanks), the lunatic guard Percy Wetmore(Doug Hutchison), the even loony-er prisoner "Wild Bill" Wharton (Sam Rockwell), and the hulking, meek inmate John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), from which the story really draws from.<br /><br />I won't give away any plot details here, but suffice it to say that pretty much everyone will enjoy this film.  While the subject matter and language (the film IS set in a prison) rules out the kiddies, pretty much anybody else should find it to be an inspiring journey, as the movie explores the themes of death, love, and doing the noble deed in the face of great opposition.<br /><br />I don't say this for many book-film combinations, but in this case you may actually be better off in seeing the film, as the acting is so wonderful and the plot does not deviate from the novel.</p></body></html>

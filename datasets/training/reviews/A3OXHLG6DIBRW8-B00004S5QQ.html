This is Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman at their best, and the supporting cast is full of well known actors of the time (Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Dooley Wilson).<br /><br />Set in Casablanca during WW II, the plot focuses on the somewhat upscale "Rick's Cafe Americaine" where a healthy amount of black market deals are made, a lot of liquor is sold, and gambling is a losing proposition for most of the patrons. Casablanca was the hub for refugees trying to get passage to Portugal and the Americas and many of the documents required for transit had to be procured through questionable means. This is where the story takes off with the love triangle between Bogart, Bergman, and Henreid.<br /><br />We have been watching a lot of classic movies with our teens to show them where a lot of the quotes they hear come from, and Casablanca is very rich territory indeed: "Play it, Sam", "Here's looking at you kid", "This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship", "Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.", "Round up the usual suspects", "We'll always have Paris"<br /><br />This movie has everything, including great acting, romance, action, good music, and exotic locations. The cinematography is simply amazing and gives the movie a truly grand feel.<br /><br />This is a classic that shouldn't be missed! Highly Recommended!</p></body></html>

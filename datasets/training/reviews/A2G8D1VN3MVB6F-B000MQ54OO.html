I was sorely disappointed. The movie did wildlife a huge disservice by casting leopard seals and killer whales as little more than evil predators. Neither species is evil. Both do what they have evolved to do. Lending some moral superiority to penguins which eat fish (and hence is a predator), while not extending the same respect to seals and whales is wrong-headed at best. It confused my nephew and caused him to want to kill whales and seals. All in all, a huge waste of time. Plus the mexican slurs provided by Robin Williams should have been removed, very insensitive. Plus, I must add it also supports the sterotype of the traditional dad as little more than a close-minded fool. Avoid this like the plague. Oh, not enough music for me. Very sad!!!</p></body></html>

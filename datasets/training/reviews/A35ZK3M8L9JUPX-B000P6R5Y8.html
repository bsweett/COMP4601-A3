<meta name="summary" content="Bridge To Terabithia (Full Screen Edition)"></head><body><p>A perpetual outsider both at home and at school, Jess Aarons just never seems to fit in no matter how hard he tries. When his goal to become the fastest runner in middle school is unexpectedly thwarted by newly arrived classmate Leslie Burke, who enters in an "all boys" race and leaves her competitors in the dust, Jess soon strikes up a friendship with the imaginative outsider. Their bond is soon cemented thanks to Leslie's love for storytelling and Jess' skill as an artist, and the two lonely kids create a secret kingdom called Terabithia that is only accessible by swinging over a stream on a nearby rope. The acting of both the children as well as that of the supporting adult actors and actresses is incredible and the movie has a very good storyline and plot which stays true to the book. Truly excellent movie.</p></body></html>

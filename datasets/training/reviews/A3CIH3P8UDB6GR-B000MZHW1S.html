He did one of the best job in his career. (Whats eating Gilbert)  I couldn't believe the acting of Leo and Djimon Hounsou.  Outstanding!  How Leo wanted that Diamond and how Djimon wanted his diamond (kid).  Both at all cost were doing everything they could within themselve to get what they wanted.  At times, both needed each other in some way to help them achieve what goal they had.  That was finding Djimon's kid and Leo's diamond.  I will say I was naive and didn't know the great extent to what goes through searching for diamonds.  After seeing this film, I can't believe how many blood was spill for small rocks that are worth to many.  It was a sad movie, but it had a great message of the "truth" coming out of this whole entire business that many lives were lost at the cost of what?  Humans that really couldn't defend themselve. Recommend everyone to watch this!  Love this Movie!</p></body></html>

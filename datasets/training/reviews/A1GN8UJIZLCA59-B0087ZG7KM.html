The film focuses on the downward spiral of Annie (Kristen Wiig) as her best friend Lil (Maya Rudolph) plans her wedding and names Annie as maid-of-honor.  Annie had a bakery that tanked and now she is forced to work at a jewelry store and live with an extremely creepy British brother & sister in a cramped apartment.  She degrades herself by sleeping with Ted (Jon Hamm) who is more than upfront about the relationship being just about hooking up.  In the meantime, she gets into a competition with Lil's new friend Helen (Rose Byrne) on who is really Lil's best friend and running the wedding.  Along the way she falls for an Irish cop Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) with whom she can't really commit.  Lil's future sister-in-law Megan (Melissa McCarthy) adds the most comedic relief as an in your face, over sexed woman who seduces an undercover air marshal on an aborted trip to Las Vegas.  While Ms. McCarthy has been garnering much deserved praise for her portrayal of Megan, it is Ms. Wiig who is the heart & soul of the film.  Watching Annie slide further and further into depression and misery could be painful, but Ms. Wiig handles it with just the right touch to where you feel sorry for Annie but she stops short of becoming completely pitiful.  There a far too numerous hysterical scenes to detail, although the trip to an exclusive bridal shop stands out.  Suffice to say, Bridesmaids will make you laugh, maybe even cry and you will have enjoyed the two plus hours of the film.</p></body></html>

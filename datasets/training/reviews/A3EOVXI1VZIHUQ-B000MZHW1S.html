<meta name="summary" content="One of the best films of 2006"></head><body><p>Aside from Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou's brilliant acting choices, duly rewarded with Oscar nominations, Blood Diamond offers action, adventure, drama, and a political message that is hard to ignore.<br /><br />Director Edward Zwick gives his film a clean, produced look without taking away the realism and humanistic punch the story delivers.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly's character leaves something to be desired, but she's still a superb actress and offers a good deal to the story, although her storyline feels a bit contrived towards the end.<br /><br />The story is too intense and multifaceted for me to attempt to describe it. You can read the actual film description for that. All I can say is that Blood Diamond presents its message in an effective and moving way, using great special effects, camera work, acting, and scenery. It's a great movie, and you won't want to miss it.</p></body></html>

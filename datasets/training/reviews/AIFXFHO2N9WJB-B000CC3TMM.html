<meta name="summary" content="The Best in the Business is Back..."></head><body><p>Three years after achieving box office and DVD/Video sales success with the 2002 action packed film "The Transporter", director Louis Leterrier returned to helm the further adventures of ex-special forces operative Frank Martin in 20th Century Fox's hit sequel, "Transporter 2". Joining Leterrier would be star Jason Statham who skyrocketed to fame with his martial arts abilities, charm, and quick wit in the first film. But could a sequel to such a surprise hit do as much business and possibly better than the original? Not to mention the story, could "Transporter 2" continue what was started in "The Transporter" by having an over-the-top action film actually having a decent story to tie the fights together or would it crumble into another meaningless pile of fight scenes with shoddy dialogue mixed in for good measure, like so many other wannabes before it?<br /><br />"Transporter 2" finds Frank Martin, retired from his transporting profession, living a quiet chauffeuring a wealthy Miami family around. However, peace is not meant to be long-lasting for Frank, as the son of the family is kidnapped, leaving Frank as the main suspect. Now, the best in the business must get himself back in the game so that he can fight insurmountable odds to save the boy and clear his name.<br /><br />So, was there any hope of "Transporter 2" possibly rivaling the original in terms of quality, fun, and high-octane action, I personally didn't think so. Well, let me say that I was wrong, not only did "Transporter 2" equal the original film, but also I believe it actually surpassed it on all counts.<br /><br />The story was equally as fun and entertaining, by having Frank be a chauffer instead of a transporter of dangerous and/or illegal goods, was an interesting change of pace for the character, and one that worked well for him. As he was in the first film, Jason Statham managed to grab the audience instantly, taking them on an incredibly fun, high-energy thrill ride. One facet of the original that I thought was so impressive were the fast-paced fight scenes that were no doubt painstakingly crafted to perfection. Plus, the fact that Jason Statham did the majority of his own stunts added to the quality, but as great as most of the fights were in "The Transporter", the sequel managed to step it up several notches. Every move was much faster, the choreography much more precise and natural, leaving me feeling as if the first film seemed too rehearsed, lacking the fluidity that the sequel offered. Both films contain visually impressive fight sequences that are both somewhat realistic and over-the-top at the same time (which is where a lot of the appeal lies for these two films), but I do believe that "Transporter 2" definitely has the upper hand in this contest.<br /><br />Overall, "Transporter 2" is an excellent, equally over-the-top (one particular car scene involving a bomb, may be too much so, but I'm not complaining) sequel that surpasses the original film, and leaves the audience craving more, just as any good movie should.<br /><br />"Transporter 2" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief nudity.</p></body></html>

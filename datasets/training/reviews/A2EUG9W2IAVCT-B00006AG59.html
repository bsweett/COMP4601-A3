<meta name="summary" content="Too Hollywood-ized"></head><body><p>Had it been a true-to-the-time portrayl instead of a hardcore rock-and-roll infused piece of Hollywood it might've faired better at the box office and critics.  Though The Mummy series never received any huge accolades beyond it being a fun, action-packed action/comedy like the Indiana Jones series, this part is hardly up to par with its two predecessors.  The hard metal music does not help the action sequences but distances them from being way too modern, as does some of the humerous, but not true-to-the-times speech, especially by the Rock.  Still, it's action-packed and full of great special effects, but it's HARDLY at the same level as The Mummy or The Mummy Returns.</p></body></html>

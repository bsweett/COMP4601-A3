Black does a solid job of giving personality to Po, making his status as underdog come to life, as he stumbles, and bumbles his way alternately through skills tests and stuffing his face. The master often laments, "There are no accidents", but when you see Po's "skills", you begin to wonder if the master could be wrong.<br /><br />Kung Fu Panda is a great family film. It does have a few minor parts of crude humor, but where it excels is in its entertainment value, personality, and ultimate message about belief in fulfilling your goals or dreams. So often you watch animated films that force the sentimental moments and they come off as a little too forced or cheesy, but Kung Fu seems very genuine in the way it presents life's lessons in not giving up.</p></body></html>

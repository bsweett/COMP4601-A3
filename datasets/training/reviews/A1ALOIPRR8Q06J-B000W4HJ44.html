Take a walk on the wild side, you know what I mean?? But anyway, if you enjoyed HAIRSPRAY you should definitely check out John Water's film version. The original film had Sonny Bono, Debbie Harry, and Ricki Lake in it. I've seen most of this one and I saw Water's version years ago. Waters is a talented cat. By the way, if you like HAIRSPRAY and are one of those unfortunate souls out there that have not experienced other classic comedies by John Waters PINK FLAMINGOS comes highly recommended. It's just good light entertainment for the family to enjoy.</p></body></html>

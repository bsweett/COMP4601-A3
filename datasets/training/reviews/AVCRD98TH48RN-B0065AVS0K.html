<meta name="summary" content="A captivating Film Noir comic book movie."></head><body><p>This is easily the most stylish film to come out since "The Matrix."  The look of the movie uses the same experimental technique I first saw in a Francis Ford Coppola film called "Rumble Fish" where the entire movie is shot in black and white with certain parts of each scene colorized for stark contrast.  This idea was later polished and brought to the mainstream in the film "Pleasantville."  Since this film is based on a Noirish comic book the mixture of extreme black and white lighting with the colorful highlights makes for a fine visual experience.  As for the cast, most of the actors turn in good performances; the most notable being those of Mickey Rourke and a remarkable cameleon-like transformation from Benicio Del Toro.  The female characters are primarily two-dimensional buxom babes with little depth of emotion, but this film is based on a comic book for young men, after all.  There are a couple of forgettable performances given by Clive Owen and Michael Madsen.  Clive Owen's work here is wooden, and Michael Madsen is plain petrified and uninspired.  I kept having the feeling that Michael Madsen joined the project in the hopes of snaring Mickey Rourke's role, and when he didn't get it, severe apathy set in.  He was great in "Resevoir Dogs," but this is by far and away the worst performance in any of his films that I've seen.  The storyline is another "Pulp Fiction"-like yarn with disjointed narrative that jumps back and forth between three violent and seemingly separate stories that cross paths at the end of the film.  The almost constant voice-over narration can be a burden on the generic movie-goer who wants more traditional film-fare, but it fits the style of this film perfectly.  There are some tedious moments, especially since this movie clocks in at over two hours, but the final result is an exciting experience with plenty to rave about and praise.  This film is destined for the Cult Classic section at your local video store.</p></body></html>

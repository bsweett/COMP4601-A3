When watching the MAKING OF documentary and realizing each minute of Kong represented some 1,200 micro movements, you can't but feel thankful.<br />There are, however, a handful of things that left me wondering after watching this DVD:<br />1) Denham refering to Ann Darrow as the "bravest girl you'll ever meet" when she spends the whole film screaming and passing out.<br />2) When one of the sailors climbs into a three with just the right height for him to become the easiest of lunches for a dinosaur.<br />3) When you notice Kong changes size all througout the film.<br />4) When you notice Kong miniature and real-size don't look alike at all.<br />5) When you notice the human characters, usually in a "small window" of the frame staring at Kong, are constantly looking up or down too much as the actors didn't know with precision where he'd be standing.<br />6) When you wonder why in heck the natives build a convenient large door in the wall for Kong to punch through.<br />Small quibbles all but still interesting to find.</p></body></html>

In my opinion of all the tragedies and events behind the WTC the one we are served here is being less about the WTC. Please, don't get me wrong. This is also something that deserves being told, the story of those who survived in the ruins, but it was like watching a movie start out with the ending. I spend the first hour of the movie feeling confused. Not because I wanted to see the explotions, great effects. But I wanted a story. To be showed something I hadn't already seen. to be led through that horrible day minute by minute. I have seen documentaries on the Discovery-channel more gripping than "World Trade Center". Though perhaps it has its' moments at the end, but with a less brilliant director the movie might had been overflowed in sentimentality.<br /><br />I recommend "United 91" instead of this. So much more realistic, and answered so many questions. And gave such an believable version of what happened on that plane.</p></body></html>

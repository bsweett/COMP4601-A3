<meta name="summary" content="Can the son survive his father's death?"></head><body><p>Nothing to brag about. One more film about the end of prohibition and Al Capone. One more film on the mafia, both Italian and Irish. And yet this film has a slightly different touch. It is the fact that the father-son issue is widely explored. A mafia boss has a foolish and cheating son. He protects him and takes under his wing another man, Michael Sullivan, to transfer his paternal love onto someone worth it. Unluckily a detail one night brings the son of this latter man, Michael Sullivan Jr., into the act of witnessing the son of the mafia boss killing another good man on the spur of his anger. This son of a mafia boss will then try to clean up his plate and start killing everyone connected to that embarrassing witness. Michael Sullivan Sr. then has to get on the road of vengeance after the killing of his wife and younger son. He thus escapes the killers with his older son and yet he will end up falling in the last trap out of sloppiness, maybe just to be even with fate and God. The only survivor will be Michael Jr. All the others will be dead and happily buried. There is a slight empathy in that filial and paternal situation. An entertaining film indeed.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</p></body></html>

These are movies that attempt to call attention to something in this world, to make a statement of some sort, whatever that may be.  Generally speaking these movies are more like independent films, not widely received by the average movie audience, because in most cases the movies prove to be boring and too self-important.  Hollywood tends to get so wrapped up in trying to be so important and to rise above being pure entertainment, that it begins to talk down to the very people that keeps them in business.  Occasionally though, a movie comes along that is important for people to see, and succeeds in avoiding the pitfalls of being too self-important and hyped up to be something that it's not, and actually manages to appeal to your average moviegoer, therefore allowing the message to be heard, and maybe make a difference in the process.  One such success for Hollywood would be Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond".<br /><br />"Blood Diamond" tells the story of the civil war that was overtaking Sierra Leone in 1999.  In the midst of the war, Daniel Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a diamond smuggler, befriends a Mende fisherman (Djimon Hounsou) in an attempt to recover a rare diamond of immense value.  During their search the fisherman's son is taken by rebel forces and coerced into joining their militia to survive.  Now the fisherman must stay focused enough to assist in recovering the diamond which holds the key to saving his son's life and that of the rest of his family as well.  Assisting in trying to save the fisherman's son is a reporter (Jennifer Connelly) who is trying to shed light on the war that is ravaging this part of Africa, in hopes that it will force the U.N. to intervene before it's too late.<br /><br />As I stated earlier most Hollywood movies that are deemed as being `important' films, tend to not do well with most moviegoers; however, this film stood out from the rest.  Why you may ask, well because director Edward Zwick (director of "Glory" and "The Last Samurai") was smart enough to make his story be interesting and entertaining, while including some star power that would enhance his chances of getting people to come to the movie.  Sometimes putting A-list actors in a movie like this could reduce the seriousness of the picture or overshadow the message, but here the actors chosen are known for more dramatic roles and lend more weight to the movie.  Leonardo DiCaprio, who has had a recent string of highly successful dramatic roles with "The Aviator" and "The Departed", really sinks his teeth into playing the former mercenary turned smuggler.  A different role for Leo to be sure, the character is far from likeable, yet I still found myself rooting for him, but part of me believes that had more to do with Djimon's character than Leo's.  Djimon Hounsou ("The Island" and "Amistad") as the Mende fisherman, Solomon Vendy, delivers another terrific performance and continues to show his range as an actor.  Jennifer Connelly ("Hulk" and "A Beautiful Mind") did a fine job of conveying the conflicted nature of her character as she is torn by wanting to help Solomon, yet in the process is wanting to help herself and her career by basically exploiting his plight and that of his country's.<br /><br />The story for the movie was solid and fast-paced for the most part, there were times it dragged along, but they were generally few and far between.  The action scenes were very intense, and spaced out nicely throughout the movie, although there were a couple of times that it felt as if the writers had realized it had been awhile since someone had been shot or something blown up, so they threw in a random conflict to spice things up, but other than that I couldn't complain about the amount of action.  I think as far as being an important movie for Hollywood to make, this film could serve as a semi-template for other films to follow, not in terms of what to base the subject matter on, but just the way the story was laid out and presented.  The key is not to talk down to the audience or beat them over the head with the message, but to present it to them in a way that makes them think for themselves, and still be entertained.<br /><br />When it was all said and done, I would have to say that this was a very good movie, but not one that I would want to see too many times, but it definitely will open eyes to what goes on within parts of the diamond industry.  And who knows maybe it will even make somewhat of a difference.<br /><br />"Blood Diamond" is rated R for violence and language.</p></body></html>

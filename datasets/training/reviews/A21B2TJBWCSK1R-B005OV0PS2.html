<meta name="summary" content="The Coen brothers best film to date!"></head><body><p>After the darkly surreal, snow swept landscapes of the Minnesota, depicted in Fargo, the Coen brothers wisely opted for a different locale and tone with bright, comedic vibe of The Big Lebowski. The film was just too odd for mainstream audiences and promptly tanked at the box office. However, it found new life on video and has since become a cult film favourite, inspiring countless websites and even an annual convention known as the Lebowski Fest that has been running for three years!<br /><br />The Coens are not known for providing many extras with the video releases of their films so it is a pleasant surprise to see a couple included with this fine disc.<br /><br />First off, there is a nice teaser trailer that is presented in its original theatrical format and features an excellent montage of the important characters from the film complete with the Kenny Rogers and the First Edition song, "Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)" that plays during the "Gutterballs" dream sequence.<br /><br />The disc also includes an entertaining 30 minute promotional video entitled, "The Making of The Big Lebowski." While not nearly as informative or exhaustive as the book of the same name that was released in conjunction with the film, this promo is worth watching if only to see Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and, in particular, the interview-shy Coens talk about their film.<br /><br />Lastly, there is the standard cast and filmmaker biographies/filmographies which features nothing that you couldn't get from a press kit or the official website. Pretty standard stuff.<br /><br />I daresay that The Big Lebowski is the Coen brothers' best film to date. It is the perfect mix of their flashy style, eccentric characters, and distinctive dialogue. It is a rare comedy that can be watched over and over and never get old. The richly detailed world that is so inviting and entertaining that you want to revisit it again and again. The Dude abides.</p></body></html>

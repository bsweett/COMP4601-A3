So I never felt I was watching it for any sort of morality event, but I guess the key component is make sure you know what you love and care for, and Love and Care for it  every day, since you never know when it will be gone, in part or in full.<br />The DVD extras are mostly light, and don't add to to the movie experience; however, Making Premonition is a fun collection of documentary like moments, and the Commentary shows some insight about Sandra ( always a plus in my view), but after you have seen the film, check out "Bringing Order to Chaos" and "Real Premonitions"; Bringing Order helps with the film, and Real premonitions show some chilling real life events.<br />Whilst PREMONITION may have been a relatively low budget film, it works well, it can be seen by many, it is not as Grotesque as the Butterfly Effect, but it is not about that sort of hard handed temporal paradoxes, it is a simple conundrum of what is the most important thing in my life. Sandra Bullock scores beautifully with a great film, wonderfully crafted.</p></body></html>

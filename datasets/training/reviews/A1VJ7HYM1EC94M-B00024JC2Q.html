<meta name="summary" content="Flawed Comedy Falls Flat"></head><body><p>Starsky & Hutch is a flawed comedy that, considering the talent, could have been far more than it ended up being. Stiller, one of the most talented comic actors of his age, here goes for shallow caricature rather than developing a true shallow character.  Where it worked for him in Zoolander it fails here.  In fact it's as though Stiller decided to ape Zoolander playing Starsky.  An interesting premise perhaps, but its execution falls fairly flat.<br /><br />Owen Wilson doesn't give much more, and doesn't fare much better.<br /><br />The duo are not without some funny moments, but overall there were long stretches of nothing padding out the comic bits.<br /><br />The film is worth watching primarily for the performances of Vince Vaughan and Snoop Dog's Huggy Bear - both breathing life into an otherwise fairly stagnant vehicle.<br /><br />Also worthwhile is Juliette Lewis in an inflated cameo is wonderful, and more than any other cast member, embodies the sexual innocence gone haywire that seemed to fuel the 70's.<br /><br />Hard to believe Chris Penn in the role he has here.  Completely unrecognizable.<br /><br />Even harder to believe is that this was directed by Todd Phillips, the director who gave us the unflinching, hard hitting documentary "Hated" about the twisted, revolting life of punk anti-hero G.G. Allin. Phillips would go on to impress in the comedies Old School and Road Trip.  Faced here with a period piece he relies too heavily on site gags (oversized portable phones, radios, etc.) which cannot alone carry a film.<br /><br />These types of films fail because they are all surface and too little substance.  The original Starsky & Hutch seems funny to us now because there was a sincerity in respecting the material.  The material may not have been great, but the premise was and the execution by David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser nearly perfect.<br /><br />Phillips has been announced as the director for The Six Million Dollar Man with Jim Carrey.  Smells all wrong to me.</p></body></html>

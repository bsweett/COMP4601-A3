Reeeeeeeally, THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST NOIR  MOVIES OF ALL TIME. Humphrey plays detective sam spade, and plays as most Private detectives were during that time. Alittle shady, yet still on the side of the law. And Sam gets caught up with The Maltese Falcon case, it starts with Mary Astor's character trying to get sam to tail her. Since she believes's she's in danger, so spade puts his partner on the job. And he buys it, which doesn't make spade happy. In the end, Sam puts the killer away, I guess alot of people's problems with it might be that there's not awhole lot of explosions. It's a mental excercise, yes it's not really hard to figure out the players. But it is fun to watch them try to double cross each other, including Spade. I would give this film more than five stars, Plus this movie has Peter Lorre in it, as well as Sydney greenstreet.</p></body></html>

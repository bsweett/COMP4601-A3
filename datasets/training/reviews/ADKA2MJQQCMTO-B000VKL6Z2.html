I was really that on the fence about it.  Final verdict is in and I feel that, although this is admittedly Zombie's best work and there is several kudos to be handed out; ultimately, the film fails.<br /><br />'Halloween' can really be split pretty evenly into two halves.  The first of which is a brand new origin-story for Myers.  Granted, it's a little clich&eacute;d and basically the same white-trash Olympics that Zombie seems to be fixated on.  At the same time though, it's really not bad and I bought into it.  The real standout here is Zombie's real-life wife (Sherri-Moon Zombie) who does a FANTASTIC job of portraying the tragedy of a mother who just can't seem to piece her life back together after Michael snaps.<br /><br />I liked Malcolm McDowell here quite a bit as well.  I've read some pretty heavy criticism of the way he approached the 'Loomis' character, however, I like his approach a little better then (God forgive me for saying this) Donald Pleasance's take.  I always saw Pleasance's 'Loomis' as just some nut that shows up screaming "He's evil!" while shooting a couple of rounds in the air.<br /><br />The real problem is, it's the very existence of this back-story that ultimately betrays the original concept of Myers in the first place.  In the original, and in most of John Carpenter's early films, Carpenter seemed to have a general understanding that nothing was scarier then the fear of the unknown.  In the original 'Halloween' Myers was an unseen terror lurking in the shadows, stalking his victims and biding his time until he decided to strike.  He didn't show even a HINT of emotion or humanity.  Until the audience caught a glimpse of him with his mask off, most people probably weren't even sure he was human.  We didn't know WHAT the motivation was for his rampage.  It was as if "death itself descended on Haddonfield."<br /><br />By explaining too much, in my opinion, Zombie ultimately betrays that concept and demystified what made Michael Myers so cool in the first place.  If you'd made the first half about ANYONE other then the Michael Myers character, it would have worked and been a hundred times better.<br /><br />I thought the second-half of the movie stumbled pretty badly.  While Zombie brought a lot of new material and ideas to the first-half, the second is a flat-out remake of the entire first movie.  At this point, in my opinion, you just can't completely remake a film that's an hour and a half in forty minutes.  It just doesn't work.  You don't have enough time to properly build any momentum, there's no atmosphere created, and absolutely no character development.  Zombie had possibly the best character actor in Hollywood in Brad Douriff and he's almost completely wasted as the film screams along at the pace of a runaway truck.  What was originally a world-class thriller is warped into an action movie, and like the first part, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />If Zombie wanted to do an origin that was completely new, he should have stuck with it.  On the other hand, if he wanted to do a shot-by-shot remake in the vein of Psycho, he should have stuck with THAT concept.  What you absolutely CAN'T do is both, which is exactly what we have here.<br /><br />While I'm willing to admit that it was a good swing; regrettably in the end, it doesn't work.</p></body></html>

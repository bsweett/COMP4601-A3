Instead it's met with dissension and hostility.  Well what's interesting is that, what at first seems like a typical Indiana Jones type adventure eventually morphs into the WEIRDEST MOVIE EVER!<br /><br />Let me describe what I mean.  The man wants to get back to his present time no matter what, right?  In order to do so he has to walk through a mountain and search for a magical book however... as soon as THIS particular adventure happens, the storyline completely changes into whacked out, psychedelic-influenced oddness.<br /><br />NOW suddenly the man is running from miniature people that are hilarious in their antics to bring the man down (such as shooting tiny cannonballs at his head and jumping inside of his mouth) and later on when the man discovers three books sitting on a pile of rocks, he has to pick the one that has the ability to take him back to his time however... he keeps picking the wrong one, and each book has their own unique set of mind-screwing characteristics.<br /><br />One book for example has a vortex inside of it that tries to suck the man to another dimension, the other book actually lifts in the air and attaches and squeezes onto the mans face.  I have to admit, it was quite freaky watching the segment where the man was running from something BIG but was apparently invisible.  Whatever it was kept splitting the trees in half while running through the woods.  VERY creepy.<br /><br />It's creepy scenes like the ones I mention above that might do more harm to a childs imagination than help, which makes me wonder what kind of audience this movie is intended for.  Oh and the second half of the movie focuses around the man and his newfound friends battling moving skeletons with swords and shields.  Let me tell you something about moving skeletons... THEY CREEP ME OUT!  I've always had a huge fear of skeletons, and their movements in this movie are downright bizarre and trigger what nightmares are made of, haha.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like is that the man was just suddenly THERE at another place and time, with no dramatic or exciting build-up.  Having such a build-up would have allowed viewers to really pull for the guy to escape harm since there'd now be a good reason for him to return back to his time.  Small complaint.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely an adventure movie with more violence than I went in expecting, but the amount of excitement is overwhelmingly awesome so I believe you should watch it.</p></body></html>

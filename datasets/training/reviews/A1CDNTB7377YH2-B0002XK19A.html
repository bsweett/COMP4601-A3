This time Peter Parker is trying to juggle keeping a job, maintaining a run-down apartment, keeping his grades up, while continuing his Spidey exploits.<br /><br />Peter starts regretting his life as Spiderman because it interferes with all other parts of his life, especially his hidden love for Mary Jane Watson.  This starts to affect his powers.  Sometimes his webs fail to fire and his vision starts to go back to what it was before he was bitten by an enhanced arachnid.  Peter must make a decision whether or not he wants to give up being Spidey and try to better his Peter life or stick to the credo he learned from his dying Uncle Ben (with great power comes great responsibility).<br /><br />Meanwhile his friend Harry (who is obsessed with killing Spiderman) is now one of the heads of Oscorp and is funding a scientist who has a new way to generate atomic energy.  Dr. Octavius has a way to create and harness a tiny sun.  This is through the use of robotic metal arms that are attached to his body and controlled through a computer chip that feeds impulses to his brain.  Something goes wrong with the experiment and the chip gets destroyed.  Out of control, the arms take control of Octavius's mind, turning him into the evil Dr. Octopus.<br /><br />The special effects outdo the original and Alfred Molina is likeable as the unfortunate Dr. Octopus (unlike the annoying and pompous villain portrayed by Willem Defoe in the first film).  The movie overdoes the comedy somewhat.  There is a take-off from Midnight Cowboy (done to the tune of Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head) and J. Jonah Jameson is one joke after another.  However, the ending is great!  The movie also sets up for the possibility of at least two villains in the next film (Harry Osborne and The Lizard, who was Dr. Curt Connor in the comic).  I have also heard the rumor that Venom is a possibility in the next film.</p></body></html>

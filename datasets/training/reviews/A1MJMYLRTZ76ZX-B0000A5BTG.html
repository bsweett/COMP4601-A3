<meta name="summary" content="Great fun if nothing else"></head><body><p>This is a delightful remake of the 1976 movie, At the Earth's Core, starring Peter Cushing (later to be famous for playing the evil Moth Tarkin in Star Wars), and Doug McClure. Much of the science is completely fictional, of course, but don't let that deter you from watching this movie. And actually, much of the structural geology is accurate about the interior of the earth which gets used to good effect in the movie. At one point, the ship is dodging giant diamond crystals the size of Manhattan.<br /><br />Overall though it's just fun, mindless entertainment, and in our sorry age of universal social decay and brouhaha, chronic economic stress and financial disasters, and endless political stalemate and nonsense while Rome burns anything that can provide some diversion is welcome. In fact, Rome does burn in one scene in this movie when the electrostatic discharges in the earth's atmosphere get out of control and fry Rome on what was until then a nice day. With a solid cast including Hilary Swank, Delroy Lindo, Bruce Greenwood, Stanley Tucci, and Aaron Eckhart, more than competent special effects, and a dramatic story, it's an intense sci-fi ride all the way to the earth's core and back.</p></body></html>

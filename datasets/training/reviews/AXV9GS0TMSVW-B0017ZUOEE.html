<meta name="summary" content="A good old fashioned ghost story"></head><body><p>The Orphanage is one of the best genre horror films in recent memory period.  To be sure, there have been unique horror films that have transcended the genre.  But every now and then, it's nice to sit down and watch a good chiller that has all of the neccessary ingredients to frighten, terrify, and possibly even move you.<br /><br />Guillermo Del Toro serves merely as a producer on this piece while Juan Antonio Bayona directs.  The subject matter has the feel of Del Toro and that may have a little to do with why his name is attached to this.  The story involves Laura and her husband Carlos and their purchase of Laura's childhood orphanage.  She wants to reopen it as a home for kids with special needs.<br /><br />She has a son, Simon.  He's very sick, but does not know it.  He has imaginary friends who become ever more apparent as the film progresses.  The thing is, throughout the film we are faced with a question.  Are these imaginary friends possibly ghosts.  Well they may be if you believe in them.<br /><br />That's really the film's success is that you really are guessing to the very end about what's going on.  Even then, I've seen film goers with various theories about the film, which makes Boyona's debut all the more auspicious.  But it's more than twists and turns that make this film.  It's got an eerie ambience.  Big old houses are breeding grounds for horror on film.  Boyona knows this and uses it to his advantage.<br /><br />The film's emotional appeal is another enjoyable facet of this film.  The characters are incredibly complex.  Laura is the unlikely horror heroine.  She's smart, but obviously terrified of what is going on.  She's unrelenting and very resourceful.  She's not your usual horror character.  Really, we are faced with none of the usual horror arechtypes in this film.<br /><br />Boyona's film is fairly straight-forward suspense-horror.  But it's delivered quite well and is one of the most enjoyable ghost type horror films I've seen in years.  If the Asian horror genre is starting to feel dried up, then Boyona might open up the door for more horror masters from Spain and beyond.</p></body></html>

A bit shaky at times though."></head><body><p>"Spider-Man 3" is a wonderful if a bit shaky successor to the spectacular "Spider Man 2" from back in 2004.  Though the reviews were decidedly mixed, it still became a phenomenal success.  I can't say for sure that it can stack up in the long-run against it's predecessor. I mean, I don't think they could surpass the mini-sun fusion machine that Doctor Octavius created.<br /><br /> The dust settles from the epic confrontation with scientist turned diabolical madman Doctor Octavius. Peter Parker's double-life as Spider Man and as Peter Parker seems to be settling back to normal at last. Mary Jane has returned into his life, things are looking up, and New York cleans up from the magnetic mess from the mini-sun that brought down Pier 56. However new threats emerge. One is a criminal named Flint Marko is on the run from the law after escaping from prison on murder charges. Due to quantum circumstances, Marko's molecular structure is altered significantly which causes him to transform into Sandman who becomes Spider Man's most powerful adversary. The other one however is an enemy that is unlike any other. It is not even just another bad human. It is an alien liquid life form that survives by attaching itself and assimilating itself onto a human called a Symbiote. And when it bonds with a host, it's very difficult to separate from it. This symbiote will have major influences on Spidey that could potentially make him worse than the villains put together if allowed to fester for too long. The effects of the symbiote are enough that they are already making Peter into something that others no longer even recognize.<br /><br /> This movie though while still a five-star suffers from a particular problem called character saturation where too many major characters are brought into focus. The same thing weighs down "X-Men: The Last Stand" from a year before with too many characters.</p></body></html>

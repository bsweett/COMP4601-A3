Reading them as a child lifted me to heights that I will never forget.<br /><br />Now - don't get down on me and trash my review. I loved the film; hence the four star rating. Anyone that has seen the BBC movie released in 1988 or so, understands that there is an enormous difference between the two films. The BBC film was, almost, line-by-line faithful to Lewis' work. Sadly, it wasn't very good. It was excruciatingly slow when it didn't need to be slow. Imagine two minutes of watching fawns and what not simply walk. Ugh. Horrific.<br /><br />This was not a line-by-line rendition of the book. Critics who say it was were on drugs. Today we live in an age where action is more preferable than faithfulness (as seen in the Lord of the Rings), but if the faithfulness is close enough, then we must accept it. I struggled with this viewing, but in the end, I decided that I liked it, that it was close enough in form to Lewis' writing. Sadly, as was Tolkien, Lewis wasn't around to tell us what he thought of it. Many critics have applauded the film for being true to Lewis' work. I can't imagine what they were thinking. Yes, there were the four Pevensies crowned at Cair Paravel. Yes, there was a White Witch (played brilliantly), and yes there was a magnificent lion and very well performed Sons of Adams and Daughters of Eve. Peter, in particular, was marvelous. Edmund, who played both a traitor and a "good guy", was intensely believable. He cast well.<br /><br />But there were serious derivations from the book. HOWEVER, this is not a bad thing. Lewis' book was not an action packed book. To turn it into a film, action need to be inserted, and the directors did just that. I'm not speaking only of the battle scene (which did not occur in the book), but rather a number of other events. However, they were all used to add tension to the story, and they didn't take anything away from the story. To speak freely - the action added events did nothing to harm Lewis' story.<br /><br />Initially I was upset at the changes that were made. Now, however, as I've had time to think about it, I can understand why *most* of the changes were made. Personally, I wouldn't have made certain changes - specifically, how Lucy and Edmund ended up in Narnia together. The change from the book to the screen didn't make much sense to me.<br /><br />All that aside, being a Narnia purist, I would love to see more movies, even if the derive a bit from Lewis' telling. This was terrific and magnificent.<br /><br />And Aslan - well, he needed to be perfect, and he was. Kudos to those who drew him. Utterly believable.</p></body></html>

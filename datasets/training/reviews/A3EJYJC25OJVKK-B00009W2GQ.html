The machines under control of the renegade program Agent Smith are fast approaching the underground city of Zion where the last remains of humanity takes its last stand against them, while Agent Smith is gaining more power by the minute. Neo is now the only one who can be able to defeat Smith for good. However, he is trapped somewhere outside the regular world and the Matrix on a mysterious train station and a very unpleasant individual called the Trainman who controls the train station can free him from there. After much hell, they manage to free Neo from the train station and now Neo must fight and defeat Agent Smith once and for all as he is the only one who can truly save humanity from total extinction. This might sound a little too close to being similar in plot to "The Terminator" but this isn't time-traveling like from those movies. <p>The special effects on this movie are amazing but at times can really go over the top. I especially love the scenery and the way the ship moves through the various tunnels. I've also felt that this movie is much darker than the last two Matrix movies and at times, it even reminds me of the creepiness of "Event Horizon" from a few years back. The massive battle scenes are just awesome and will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole time they occur. <p>I know Neo is one of the center characters and Keanu Reeves does such an excellent job at bringing Neo to life but from my opinion, it's Hugo Weaving who really steals the spotlight. Weaving does such a fantastic job at playing the numerous replicates of Agent Smith that he easily tosses just about everyone else on the cast into orbit around the earth. I must say, outside of playing Elrond, I will forever remember Hugo Weaving here as he can really play some frightening bad guys and this movie proves just that. Weaving is scary as the dangerous program Agent Smith. The rest of the actors/ actresses except for Bellucci (Persephone) and the guy, who played Merovingian, do pretty well. <p>As awesome as this is, there are quite a few gripes I have with this movie. First, with such a wide variety of different realities and high number of questions that the previous two left us wondering, "Revolutions" only seemed to answer a few of them yet also created a whole new trainload of new questions that are never answered. The ending even if this is the final trilogy, doesn't seem to quite give a sense of the danger now gone for good but I guess these things were the purpose. On the other hand, I can see why they didn't have so everything is answered as it would be just about impossible to have answers handed over in real life. I can also understand why it is confusing as this movie was designed to make one figure out what was going on and how fate is almost impossible to escape. Very disappointed. <p> I felt gravely disappointed with Merovingian and Persephone. We saw Persephone help Morpheus Neo and Trinity and kill one of Merovingian's henchmen but here, she was just totally dumbed-down to just a deaf mute character on here and the couple only appear for about may a few minutes altogether. I expected a lot more out of these two, whether Persephone would battle her husband or betray Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus. I felt hugely disappointed with these two and felt that this movie could have done without them. I especially hated the way she looked on this movie. The repulsive outfit that she wore looked so tight that those busts looked like they would have their blood circulation cut off. Yergh! Bellucci was good in the "Reloaded" movie but here, she has brought along some of the emptiest acting that I've seen in many years. <p>The main flaw in this movie is that with such a HUGE dimensions that this movie tackles, just the two hour and fifteen minute length only covers the tip of the iceberg. I think that this movie would've been so much better had it been extended for at least another half hour or even up to over three hours long. Perhaps the movie studios are planning on releasing Platinum Extended Editions with new footage incorporated into the movies the way they did with "Lord of the Rings", I don't know but I felt that "Matrix Revolutions" length doesn't do it a lot of justice. For what it is, "Matrix Revolutions" is awesome, but it could really have been an outstanding epic finale. This is a definite must-own movie whenever it comes out on DVD but I feel that this had a lot of room for improvement and that they blew their chance at it. Then again maybe they are planning on releasing an extended edition of this movie in the foreseeable future to make up for the flaws on here. I can understand how many were disappointed with this movie but even then, this doesn't deserve the high number of negative reviews.<p>It's still a very good movie and the tons and tons of awesome action, battle scenes along with the tons of fun in this film make up for the missteps on here but the missteps are bigger than those in "Reloaded". They created a fantastic trilogy that well definitely be sci-fi classics in the years to come. Go and see this movie today. Just don't expect anything near perfection and if you can get by some of the major flaws, this is just an awesome movie. I can't wait to have all three of these movies once they are all on DVD.</p></body></html>

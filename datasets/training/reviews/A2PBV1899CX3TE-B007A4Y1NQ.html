I didn't know Orrin Hatch was out of his cage.<br /><br />A puppeteer discovers a portal that leads literally into the head of the movie star, John Malkovich.<br /><br />Craig Schwartz: Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.<br /><br />Craig discovers that LesterCorp is on the 7 1/2 floor of the Mertin Flemmer building by seeing a "7 1/2" on a building directory in the lobby - at the 7 1/2-minute point of the film.<br /><br />Dr. Lester: Any questions?<br />Craig Schwartz: Just one. Why are these ceilings so low?<br />Dr. Lester: Low overhead, my boy - we pass the savings on to you! But seriously, that'll all be covered in the orientation.<br /><br />The play that Craig was performing with his puppets (when he gets smacked by an angry parent) is based on the letters of Abelard and Heloise, written between 1115 and 1117 AD, which were found, copied and abridged by Johannes de Vepria, a 15th century Cistercian monk, into "Ex Epistolis duorum amantium" ("From the Letters of Two Lovers"). This became a classic document of early romantic (tragic) love used by many artists in their work including William Shakespeare in Romeo and Juliet. In addition, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's later project Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) took its title, and no small amount of inspiration, from Alexander Pope's "Eloisa to Abelard."<br /><br />Dr. Lester: I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech.<br /><br />The 1990 Steppenwolf Theatre building in Chicago (Malkovich was one of the first members of Steppenwolf, and remains one today) includes a half-floor used for storage.<br /><br />The original script has Kevin Bacon in place of 'Charlie Sheen' , as Malkovich's actor friend.<br /><br />John Malkovich: Ma-Sheen!<br />Charlie Sheen: Malcatraz!<br /><br />The play that John Malkovich is rehearsing on stage is Shakespeare's "Richard III." The lines "Was ever a woman in this humour woo'd? / Was ever a woman in this humour won?" are I.ii.239-240, where Richard is gloating over his use of power, lies and crime to obtain the woman he desires, Lady Anne. This rehearsal scene is immediately followed by the first time that Craig makes love with Maxine via Malkovich.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Maxine: Tell me a little about yourself.<br />Craig Schwartz: Well, I'm a puppeteer...<br />Maxine: [turns to bartender] Check!<br /><br />Several characters in the movie remember Malkovich as having played a jewel thief, even though, as he correctly points out, he never did. However, Malkovich did eventually play a jewel thief in Johnny English (2003).<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Craig Schwartz: You don't know how lucky you are being a monkey. Because consciousness is a terrible curse. I think. I feel. I suffer. And all I ask in return is the opportunity to do my work. And they won't allow it... because I raise issues.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />[last lines]<br />Craig Schwartz: [voiceover] Maxine. Maxine, I love you, Maxine. Oh, look away. Look away. Look away. Look away. Look away. Look away. Look away.

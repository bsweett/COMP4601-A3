<meta name="summary" content="A near-great movie"></head><body><p>I enjoyed "Up" quite a bit, despite some slow stretches and a couple of obvious plot holes - if Carl is 78 years old, Muntz would be 100+. Production is superb, and the opening segment, showing us Carl's life with his beloved Ellie, is touching and true-to-life.  Once the main story begins, however, things spin slightly out of control; as with all Pixar movies, there's a lot of action for action's sake, even if it doesn't always make sense. Nonetheless, this is a fun movie, suitable for ages 8 and up. I'd give it 4.5 stars if Amazon allowed half-stars.</p></body></html>

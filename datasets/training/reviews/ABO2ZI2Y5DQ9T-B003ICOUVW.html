The terrified villagers suspect that gypsies (or the bear they keep) are responsible for the deed, but on the full moon night the locals are to know the real culprit is out there in the woods - some mysterious creature that starts attacking people, killing them with its superhuman power.<br /><br />As you know, this is a remake of the 1941 Universal horror classic "Wolfman" starring Lon Chaney, Jr. and Claude Rains, but the plot is considerably changed, presumably to allow for more special effects. I don't mind these changes as long as the film delivers the goods, but I am afraid that is not exactly the case here.<br /><br />For all Rick Baker's special make-ups and effective production designs, the film remains largely thrill-free, due to the predictable script (originally penned by Andrew Kevin Walker, rewritten by David Self) and pretty ineffective storytelling that fails to build tension during the action scenes. One exception is the impressive observation room sequence in which a character strapped in a chair morphs into a werewolf, but the rest of the film is just OK. The romance is there, but Emily Blunt's heroine remains uninteresting, wasting any opportunity for her to show what she can do. Hugo Weaving, like he always does, steals every scene he is in, but his character itself is sadly underwritten.<br /><br />This is the first work from director Joe Johnston since "Hidalgo" in 2004, whose "October Sky" is one of my favorite films. Though not totally a terrible film, "The Wolfman" has turned out a little disappointing, lacking a good story to tell.</p></body></html>

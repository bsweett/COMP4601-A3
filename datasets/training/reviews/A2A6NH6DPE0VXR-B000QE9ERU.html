<meta name="summary" content="Thomas Jane is the Punisher"></head><body><p>The Punish stars Thomas Jane (61, Deep Blue Sea, Dreamcatcher) as a former agent who's out for revenge. His wife and son were killed by the thug's of a power man (John Travolta) and he was left for dead. Jane makes this movie 100% and is why it's watchable. He can try too hard to look tough and sound tough at times. Still though he pulls off the part well when a lot of comic fans doubted that he could. The movie is dark and violent and basically can be compared to other revenge movies like Mad Max and DarkMan. Hell even how his wife and son die is a rip-off from how Max's wife and son die in Mad Max.<br /><br />  I'd like to see a sequel though because Jane does the part well. Although this wasn't a great movie a sequel has more potential because it can be more than just a revenge movie. With a better a script and Jane in the role a sequel could be great. John Travolta is a good actor but as Saint, it's jut basically a walk on role. Anyone could've played the part. Plus he has been better, he's not terrible but he's just dry in the role and does nothing for it. I think a lesser known actor would've been better for the part. Will Patton (Gone in 60 Seconds) is in better  villain form though as his head henchman. I actually think Rebecca Romijn-Stamos shines as well as a waitress who falls for Jane. She gets called a bad actress a lot but I've seen worse.  Roy Scheider is also good in a small role as the Punisher's father in the opening scenes.<br /><br />  Some of the action in this movie is fun too. I like Jane's big fight with a huge hired hitman named the Russian (WWE's Kevin Nash). Also is a clever scene where  a killer with a guitar sings to him and says I'll sing this song to you at your funeral. Those 2 scenes are what work the most. You've seen better comic book movies with a lighter tone and more humor but fans of the comic should still like what Jane brings to the role.</p></body></html>

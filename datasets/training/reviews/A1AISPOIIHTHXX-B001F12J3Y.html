<meta name="summary" content="3.5; excuse the pun but I've never seen a movie as bi-polar as this"></head><body><p>Director Robert Zemeckis' films have always used the latest in technology to bring a new way of approaching special effects. The process of animating toons in Who Framed Roger Rabbit without the grain from earlier attempts worked beautifully while Forrest Gump used old archival footage and matched it with recently shot footage and you literally can't tell the difference. Using the book of the same name for inspiration, he brings in a new technology(or let's say a revamped one) that while it does have the visuals, it lacks what should be in a Christmas film: heart.<br /><br />Hero Boy(I'm literally not making this up, that's how he's credited) is starting to not believe in Christmas. So the titular train stops by picking up other kids who don't and takes them all the way to the North Pole. It's a weird concept personally: rather than let the kids just not believe, it's like "alright kid get on and we'll prove to you Santa exists". The entire trip takes up the bulk of the film as they go through mini-adventures before reaching the North Pole.<br /><br />First thing I have to say before I start listing complaints is the visuals: holy crap these look awesome. This film is literally reference quality if you want to test your new TV. The train is quite detailed, the colors, the landscape all has topnotch quality written on it. I'm going to mention the actual characters next because that's where it falters.<br /><br />One common complaint in reviews was the way the characters looked, especially the eyes. They look rather lifeless and without a soul, as if you were staring into a doll. When the Jolly Fat Man shows up, to me he literally looked like a mannequin. Also mouth movements looked incredibly strange to me. The idea of using "performance capture" it's the same as motion capture but also capturing the faces is a relatively new technology(the same technique was emplored to bring Gollum to life in the Lord of the Rings trilogy) but the execution is still off.<br /><br />Another complaint I personally have is the padding of the length. It's literally a 45 minute film stretched out twice the size, you can notice scenes just seem to be put in to expand the length(such as a rather lame hot chocolate song). Also hearing Tom Hanks' recognizable voice coming out of no more than 5(!) characters takes you out of the film a bit. He does an excellent job with Santa though, the only time I couldn't tell it was him.<br /><br />Now the ever important question: since it's designed to be a holiday film does it work. In a way. Kids will love it. It's got the magic and splendor that Christmas should have although they might find it a bit too suspenseful, especially when the train starts to speed up. Buy it for the kids but as an adult watching it, the flaws will be easily detectable.</p></body></html>

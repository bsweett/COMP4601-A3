<meta name="summary" content="Sheep Dip"></head><body><p>THE GOOD SHEPHERD(2006) Directed and Produced by Robert De Niro.<br />Executive Production by Francis Ford Coppola.<br /><br />  Starring Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, Alec Baldwin, Keir Dullea,<br />Michael Gambon, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton, Joe Pesci, John Turturro<br />and Robert De Niro.<br /><br />  A crappy and blatantly dishonest retread of the 70s era Commie prop<br />film that Hollywood used to produce to undercut American morale and<br />give aid and comfort to the enemy. Dull and badly acted, the film<br />purports to be the history of the CIA from its inception to the Bay of<br />Pigs. All the Jane Fonda/John Kerry Moscow dictated slop is splashed<br />out on the viewer. All the historical characters names are changed to<br />protect the filmmakers from lawsuits and, if one stays to the very end<br />of the credits, one will see a small paragraph where the film basically<br />says Yup we lied but who stays until the end of the credits?<br /><br />  Recommended for people who hate their country and dream of mass murder<br />and terror being perpetrated on American soil.<br /><br /> You will deserve this film.<br /><br /> Enjoy.<br /><br /> Crap.</p></body></html>

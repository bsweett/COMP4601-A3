<meta name="summary" content="wow stan could sure make a powerfull movie but what else is new"></head><body><p>great powerfull movie this was,, i really enjoy how stan dosent have to add a score to make the drama more powerfull thats how good the directing is. i also enjoy the story very much. i really dont see many movies that show the break down people feel in boot camp. the only bad thing is it was full screen but still i love this film!!!</p></body></html>

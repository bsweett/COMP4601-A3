<meta name="summary" content="My personal favorite"></head><body><p>This film displays all of Hitchcock's genius - his intricate camerawork, his understanding of the mechanism of suspense and his appreciation of humor, as well as more brilliant work by his regular costume designer Edith Head - and I think that for several reasons, it its solidly his best film. For one thing, while films like 'Marnie' have long since begun to show their age, and even such greats as 'The Birds' lose something for modern viewers accustomed to slicker visuals, Rear Window is such a simple story (though not without a great depth of subtext) that it has a timeless quality. Also, the comic script is one of the best that Hitchcock ever adapted, full of crackling dialogue and fully drawn characters.</p></body></html>

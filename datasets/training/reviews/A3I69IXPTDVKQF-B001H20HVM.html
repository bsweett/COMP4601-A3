<meta name="summary" content="The Terror Continues, And The Story Starts Digging Deeper"></head><body><p>The blood games continue in "Saw II", as a SWAT team has finally tracked down the Jigsaw killer and raids his hideaway, but an obstacle remains to carting the killer off to jail: a new game is in progress, and from his warehouse base-of-operations, Jigsaw holds the keys to the fates of not two but eight new victims caught in a new deathtrap that occupies an entire re-inforced, inescapable house.<br /><br />  The 'participants' in this latest game are a more disparate, and often highly hostile, group as compared to previous captives, and it appears that the more sympathetic characters are going to have threats other than the ones Jigsaw's assembled to deal with.  And complicating matters for the police who have to try and navigate this unexpected development without getting anyone killed is this: one of the eight is the teenage son of the detective in charge.  The challenges are ghastly, the secrets behind all this sinister, and the complexity of the whole saga really begins getting driven up here.  Another universally great job by the movie's actors and actresses, including Tobin Bell as Jigsaw and Shawnee Smith as Amanda, Jigsaw's first 'return victim', who survives her ordeal in the original 'Saw' only to be captured again.  A great chapter in an essential horror series.</p></body></html>

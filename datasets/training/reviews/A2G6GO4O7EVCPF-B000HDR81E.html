Vaughn spots Aniston at a Baseball Game and hits on her and buys her a hot dog while she is on a date. They eventually hook up and they become a happy couple until their relationship starts to turn to the sour route. Brooke is mad at Gary because he doesnt want to do anything around the house and he wants to do things his way. Gary is mad at Brooke because she wont let him relax after a hard days work from doing his Tour Bus job. He relaxs by playing video games like Grand Theft Auto. Soon the 2 are making each other crazy doing outrageous things and trying to make the other one jealous and they as the title tells "Break-Up". The "Break-Up" is a Romantic Comedy in which coasts on funny moments, Vaughn's engery and some of the supporting cast. Aniston is better in this then she was in Derailed and there's a scene where she, well gets down to her birthday suit and I have to say she looked hot. Jon Favreau (Made, Swingers) is great as Vaughn's buddy Johnny O. Vaughn & Favreau work great together. I just wish Favreau had a bigger part. Judy Davis (The Ref, Naked Lunch) is fun as Aniston's boss Marilyn Dean.  John Michael Higgins (Best in Show, Fun With Dick and Jane) as Richard was hilarious especially when he beats the crap outta Vaughn. Also starring Vincent D'Onofrio (Law and Order: CI, The Cell), Cole Hauser (Pitch Black, The Cave), Justin Long (Waiting, Jeepers Creepers), Jason Bateman (Arrested Development, Starsky & Hutch), Ivan Sergei (Crossing Jordan, The Opposite of Sex), Ann-Margret (Newsies, Any Given Sunday), Keir O'Donnell (Lost, Wedding Crashers), Veron Vaughn (Made, Swingers) and Joey Lauren Adams (Chasing Amy, Mallrats). In conclusion it wasnt the worst Romantic Comedy but it wasnt the best. If you're looking for a movie to bring a date well you can go see it and hopefully you'll have a good time</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="25 years of A Christmas Story!"></head><body><p>Hard to believe that this year marks 25 years we were introduced to young Ralphie and the quest for his air power rifle. It is still a fun filled movie for the entire family. Of course we don't recommned that you stick your tongue on a frozen pole and savoring the taste of a bar of soap (you could if you want to!). A Christmas Story is delightful all the way. Fast forward 25 years later to 2008, Peter Billingsley is the man behind another successful Christmas movie...Four Christmases. We will never get enough of this movie for many years to come. I liked this one...enjoy!!!</p></body></html>

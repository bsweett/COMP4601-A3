So many roles in here are award-worthy-Patrick Fugit as the young rock writer, Kate Hudson as rock band-aid Penny Lane, Frances McDormand as a worried mother, and the scene stealing Philip Seymour Hoffman as rock critic Lester Bangs.  Every one of these characters is lovable despite their flaws.  The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and it is integral to the tale Crowe is weaving for the audience.  This is an all-time best movie.</p></body></html>

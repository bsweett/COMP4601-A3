The audience I witnessed this with were rolling in the aisles, perceiving perhaps tons more than I possibly did - but the stark reality is that this is a motion picture that intends to shock and awe with its' series of gratuitous inappropriate gags, and for a large part these gags just do not work.<br /><br />The seemingly hilarious script seems contrived and ineffective, and the performances are decidedly one-note. That said, "The Hangover" represents a new low for cinema in general, only because the five star reviews from critics for this particular motion picture, are both unwarranted and misguided. Lead actor Bradley Cooper and Heather Graham have some of the most ludicrous situations to work with, but there isn't really any 'acting' going on, so to speak.<br /><br />Any scenes that involve humor directed upon and toward infants (in this case of a sexually suggestive nature) and seem to glorify and patronize infant violence is absolutely intolerable. Even with the ethical elements removed, these scenes weren't even that funny. Zach Galifianakis, who did exceptional work on `Tru Calling' is reduced to a slab of ridiculousness, and the celebrity guest roles do nothing for the enterprise.<br /><br />This was more like a collection of vignettes than an actual feature film. As both a commercial and critical venture, this is very far removed from what a comedy ought to be, and this is disappointing. Perhaps this says a lot about the state of our current audiences.<br /><br />Two Stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Enough with the plot twists"></head><body><p>I wanted to like this movie, but it failed me. First off the dvd has three versions: US, French and dubbed. The US is a mix of dubbing and subtitles. The French is subtitle (and the best) and the dubbed is horrendous.<br /><br />Now to the film itself. It's gritty and well done. The gore will keep you on the edge of your seat. All is well until the plot twist. This is where the film disappoints. Such a potential of a movie.</p></body></html>

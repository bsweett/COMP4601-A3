<meta name="summary" content="Eh, decent"></head><body><p>Eh, I thought Prometheus was only okay. Decent. Not great or anything. I had a hard time getting into the story, and I thought the majority of characters could have been better. I didn't feel a whole lot of suspense throughout the movie either, but there were some parts that may seem gory and intense to some. I didn't care for the android character, felt too much like something I'd seen in Alien. And the ending was way too much like Alien, I won't spoil how or anything though. Overall, it's decent, but not anything I'd own. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable but a little shocking for a PG-13 movie"></head><body><p>The movie was enjoyable, and better then I expected. Its a good comedy, mixed with a little drama, good action but very predictable. I'll admit I never seen the orignal but the thing that shocked me was the language. I dont have a problem with swearing but for a PG-13 movie, it seemed like it was too much. Espeically hearing Steve Austin drop the n word, made me cringe. I saw kids that were 10 and younger sitting in the theater, and I realized this world is diffently going down the tube. This movie diffently deserved an R rating for the language alone; I mean if this movies passes for PG-13, I cringe to think of how the vaules of America is going down the tubes. Just check the music scene of today. Whats next that will be tarnished?</p></body></html>

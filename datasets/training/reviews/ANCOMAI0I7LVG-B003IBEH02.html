<meta name="summary" content="Not so lovely..."></head><body><p>I was very open in my review for the novel of my thoughts here.  The story just does not justify the hype.  This has been lauded and rendered a revelation by fans (the novel that is) and yet while reading it I couldn't help but feel extremely underwhelmed.  I wanted so much more, and instead of feeling inspired and deep and profound, `The Lovely Bones' felt amateurish and slightly cheap.<br /><br />When I read that Peter Jackson was taking this on, I was intrigued for a number of reasons.  I am not the largest Jackson fan, but his more intimate works are really inspired.  He should make more `Heavenly Creatures' and less `Lord of the Rings', but whatever.  The idea of him taking a premise that could meld both worlds seemed inspired in his hands.  Any reservations I had with the source material seemed insignificant at that point.  The same story, told in more capable hands, can prove to be an entirely different experience, and with Jackson, Ronan, Weisz, Sarandon and Tucci on board (eh to Wahlberg, but whatever) I was really interested to see the turnout.<br /><br />Sadly, this was actually worse than the novel.<br /><br />The problem with `The Lovely Bones' is that it has no real identity.  Even in film format, this story feels almost skeletal.  It really needed a core, something to beat through the barrage of clich&eacute;s to create something that felt original or even remotely inspired.  Instead, `The Lovely Bones' builds on familiarity to create something devoid of anything compelling.<br /><br />Ronan is an inspired actress, and she nails her performance.  She grasps the delicate naivety that floats in and out of our protagonist.  Her wide eyes wonderment soaked into the roots of the film to give it a slight heft in areas.  Sadly though, her performance isn't enough to save the film from itself.  The rest of the cast is barren.  Wahlberg is a mess, as expected.  He oversells his scenes and comes across highly unrealistic.  You can always see him acting.  Weisz is barely there, Sarandon is a caricature and Tucci is just plain awful, but I blame a lot of that on Jackson's too `on the nose' direction.  The way he frames his shots is gross.  I hate the way he shoots Tucci to be this `evil incarnate' instead of allowing the audience to be absorbed in the performance.  He has to tell us too much with the way he shoots each scene.  The music, the lighting, the pacing; it just all is too direct.  The visual effects are at times stunning, but other times it is rather garish and `too much'; like recent Tim Burton fare.  Jackson has had an issue with this in the past.<br /><br />Some directors don't know when to stop adding buttons to the sash.<br /><br />So, much like the novel, this is an underwhelming feature.  Ronan is wonderful, but the barrage of mediocrity here is too much to ignore.</p></body></html>

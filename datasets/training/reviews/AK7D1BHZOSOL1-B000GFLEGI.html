<meta name="summary" content="Much better then I thought it was going to be"></head><body><p>. For once in one of Romero's Dead flicks we get to see many of the main characters live. I liked the characters in LOTD a lot. I think that this film had good to great acting. It was definitely funny, I thought that Dennis Hopper was a scream. He did an excellent parody of the stupid rich CEOs that try to control our lives. The heroes were as well developed as the previous films in the series. I mean, do we really know that much about the other characters in the other dead films. If I recall, not really. In the other films, just when the audience gets to know and like a character, they usually get bumped off. At least with LOTD, there is a possibility that these guys have a real chance to live past the credits and into the next film. That is, if Romero wants to use some of the same characters in the next Dead film. As for the explosions, violence, nudity, and all the other fun stuff, it fits because it reflects our times. With the exception of the nudity and hot lesbians, tune into the news and you get to see the violence and explosions every night. Romero is just thrusting that point in our face so that we open our eyes to that. The violence in the film is not pretty and for once I felt sorry for the zombies. They had a right to be pissed, and Big Daddy, the lead zombie, was right in rallying the troops.<br /><br />Well, if I said too much, I didn't mean to bore anyone. But I'm sick of certain people ripping this film. If you don't like it, fine. Instead of sitting at your computer typing, make a better movie. Go on, give it a try.<br /><br />I'm porbably going to see it agian just so I can watch the part with the Naval Ring.</p></body></html>

In a story with that backdrop and set in a 1935, you could expect death to be a main theme... in this case you'd be wrong. Surprisingly, we are quickly drawn into the lives of the prisoners and their guards in what can only be described as normal daily existence. They worry about normal things like friendships, security, conformity and boredom. We can therefore believe in them as real people, with pasts and futures, rather than two-dimensional silhouettes merely cast onto horrific scenery.<p>The Green Mile is not a film that can be easily described. All of the characters are important. If there is a plot, it is submerged beneath a dozen important sub-plots. The characters are what keep us entranced during  this three-hour celebration of morality. Our point of view is firmly glued to the senior guard on the Green Mile, Paul Edgecomb, played with feeling by Tom Hanks. Paul is a good man, surviving the great depression in a less than attractive job. We are witness to his strength early in the film as he deals with an excruciating urinary tract infection. This strength is displayed in other ways as the story progresses.<p>Based on a series of Stephen King novellas, we are not surprised when a new inmate arrives who fails to fit into any kind of prison mold. John Coffey, (J.C. - get it?), is a mountain of a man who exudes innocence and peace in equal measures. Every day that he stays on the row, increases Paul's belief that Coffey was wrongly convicted of killing two little girls. It is only after Coffey displays a miraculous healing gift that Paul starts to question the status quo.<p>But Paul's redemptive efforts, and even his work, are constantly hampered by a junior guard, Percy Wetmore, (Doug Hutchison). Percy is well connected in political circles and uses this form of protection to free his base desires. He likes to humiliate, frighten and hurt other people, never a good combination  in a prison guard. Luckily, Percy is well matched by Paul Edgecomb. We have confidence that Paul will eventually master Percy.<p>Balance seems to be important in the story because just as Paul and Percy struggle on opposite sides of morality, John Coffey is soon introduced to his opposite, William &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Wharton, (Sam Rockwell). Wharton is a thoroughly evil man. Not content with enjoying his own warped hobbies, he seems driven to spread as much suffering as inhumanly possible. Unconcerned with his impending execution, he takes every opportunity to attack the guards. We even feel some sympathy for Percy when he comes within the diseased reach of Wharton.<p>All the support roles are outstanding, although Graham Green's character, Arlen Bitterbuck, was not so memorable. I'd like to especially praise David Morse, who plays Brutus, Paul's right hand man; and Michael Jeter, playing a Cajun prisoner, Eduard Delacroix, who has a comic dose of eccentricity. Eduard introduces another minor character, Mr Jingles the mouse.<p>There is a lot of symbolism in The Green Mile. The mouse, eventually adopted by Eduard, seems to represent freedom. He comes and goes without  restriction. He can't be trapped and he enjoys life, as expressed through his simple circus tricks. Coffey's healing power clearly represents good or perhaps the power of God. The ephemeral black insects he releases after absorbing disease, imply more than illness. Perhaps sickness is supposed to be an evil of the body. Sadly, Coffey eventually embodies pure goodness in our minds, and then he renounces the world and its ubiquitous evil. We are almost convinced there is no hope in our lives but luckily, Paul's strength shows us that hope can never fully disappear.<p>In the end, a film that might have centered on the morality of the death penalty, takes us in another direction entirely. Our focus is always Paul Edgecomb. His moral strength and eventual spiritual test are offered to us as a testimony. Hanks' performance forces us to examine our own lives. Can we recognize the good in those around us and, more importantly, can we resist the evil?</p></body></html>

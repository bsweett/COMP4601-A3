Are You Ready To ROCK!!!"></head><body><p>"School of Rock" has been called formulaic, predictable, silly, etc.  What it hasn't been called is boring or uninteresting.  That's what makes this movie so great.  Even though you pretty much know what is going to happen through all of the film, you enjoy every minute of it.  From Black's idiotic Dewey character to his outrageous scheme to find lost rock glory, this entire film entertains.  With a solid supporting cast and brilliant young actors and actresses, this film is worth the price.<br /><br />Much like with "Shallow Hal," Black shows us that being the geeky kid or the quiet kid or the chubby kid doesn't matter as long as you believe in yourself and enjoy what you do.  Black takes a bunch of kids with insecurities and turns them into a group of confident youngsters who rock with the best of them.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really great feel-good flick that most of the family can enjoy.  There is a little language, but other than that, Black keeps the movie pretty clean.<br /><br />I recommend it to folks who like classic rock, family comedy, or the erratic stylings of Jack Black.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

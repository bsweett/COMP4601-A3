<meta name="summary" content="Supertramp's magic bus"></head><body><p>Who are you? (who,who? who, who?)<br />It seems the hero of this beautiful and sad film did not get the chance to find out, nature killed him before he made it.<br />Don't blame nature alone, the man clearly had a death wish and provoked the danger that beat him in the end.<br />A young man from a well to do but not entirely harmonious family decides to drop out and become a hippy, a tramp, a hobo, a hermit. He hates society but finds friends wherever he goes. Well, apart from Alaska. He hates the concept of 'people', but people seem to love him and hate to lose him. In other words, he is one heck of a selfish monster, this nice guy.<br />He calls himself Alexander Supertramp and even makes a half-hearted and obviously brainless effort at getting new ID papers with that name. Purpose is to make himself unfindable to his folks. He ends up as an Alaskan hermit in an abandoned old bus wreck.<br />His mind is formed by Thoreau, Jack London, Tolstoy. The time is early 90s. I have not read the book, which was a 'non-fiction bestseller', so I would not know if the movie could have been better. As it is, I liked it a lot.</p></body></html>

Director Poul Thomas Anderson creates a parallel universe all his own (ostensibly the early 20th century) through daring use of lighting, music, and silence. Daniel Day Lewis's performance as the uncomprising oilman is superb. A few lulls and an abrupt ending are the only thing that detract from this one. Admittedly not to all tastes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Reese Witherspoon is a revelation!"></head><body><p>"Walk the Line" as James Mangold directs it is not the movie I would have made.  I would have begun at Folsom Prison, and would have carried the movie from there deep into the 1970s, through and beyond Cash's network TV show.  Much of what the rest of the movie covered -- the years between Cash's first record in 1955, and his marriage to June Carter in 1968 -- I would have condensed and inserted as flashbacks during the post-Folsom action.<br /><br />Then again, that's why they didn't come to me to make the movie.<br /><br />This film had to introduce Johnny Cash to a 2500-screen audience that hadn't heard all that many records, or read either of his autobiographies.  Thus, the long simmering love story between Carter and Cash takes center stage, with all of the usual beats of a celebrity biopic: the meet cute, the stormy courtship, the offbeat marriage proposal.  All of this material is competently handled and exactly what you would expect.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix has been rightly praised for his performance.  He reportedly spent hundreds of hours learning the guitar and mastering That Voice, and every second of that preparation shows.  No celebrity biopic is going to stand if the actor is not up to par, and I cannot envision someone doing a better job than Phoenix of portraying Johnny Cash from ages 18 through 36.<br /><br />The real relevation for me, though, was Reese Witherspoon.  The movie takes it first real breath of air when she collides into Phoenix backstage at an early Cash concert in Texas.  Her singing voice is also marvelous.  Witherspoon and Phoenix sing the Carter/Cash duet "Jackson" twice in the movie, and nail it both times.<br /><br />At those moments when Phoneix and Witherspoon are onstage together, and demonstrating their remarkable craft, this movie transcends the typical off-the-rack movie biography, and becomes something truly magical.</p></body></html>

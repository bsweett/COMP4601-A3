<meta name="summary" content="The greatest action adventure of all time!!!"></head><body><p>Steven Speilberg, George Lucas, &amp; Harrison Ford scored big with this one, Dr. Jones (Ford) is an archeologist who's quest for rare antiques usually get him in all kinds of mishaps, his search for a rare Idol is neat at the beginning, after he acquires it through death-defying stunts, it is taken from him by a rival archeologist, the film then progresses to its plot where Jones is contacted by government agents who have learned that the Ark Of The Convenant (keeper of the Ten Commandments) may have been discovered, the film is set in 1936 at a time when Hitler is seeking world domination &amp; believes the Ark can help him acquire it, fearing Hitler's pursuit they hire Jones to go after it &amp; get it before the Nazis do, what follows is one cliffhanger after another, when Jones meets up with his old flame &amp; takes her on the journey with him,they are attacked by anyone &amp; everyone, Jones soon discovers that his rival is working for Hitler, but has a plan all his own in acquiring the Ark's magic, Jones acquires it first only to have it taken, the action is non-stop as Jones tries to take it back, he is soon captured along with Marion(his old flame), what follows the last ten minutes is the magic of ILM, Belloq(Jones rival) attempts to open the Ark before delivering it to Hitler, when he does it is his &amp; Hitler's stooges' undoing, the message is clear ( don't mess with the almighty!!!!!!) only Jones &amp; Marion are spared &amp; the Ark delivered to the U.S. for safe-keeping in what might be considered Area 51, one of the best films ever made.</p></body></html>

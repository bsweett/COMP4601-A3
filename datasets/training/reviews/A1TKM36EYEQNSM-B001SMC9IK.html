In this case, it would be disingenous of me to do so.  Here is a movie with a great plot, interesting message potential and really great effects, falling very short of a great film or even a good one.<br /><br />We have the movie well acted by Reeves, Connolly and Jaden Smith (Will Smith's son and great child actor in Pursuit of Happyness).  Yet with all the potential, the seeming sending of multiple messages makes the movies somewhat mushy as far as getting to anything meaningful.  As you have seen in the trailers, Reeves asks:"Your planet...?" when he is speaking with the US Secretary of Defense.  You are lead to think, okay, whose planet is he insinuating it is?  Does it belong to the animals, the universe, or to the invaders?<br /><br />I think it would have been a stronger message if they would have had the world leaders vying for what is important to them and lets say scientists who have a different world view.  Even if the message was a little slanted, at least it was an attempt at clarity.<br /><br />Ratings:<br /><br />5 for special effects<br />3 for story line<br />4 for overall acting<br />3 for tempo<br />3 for message<br /><br />Maybe there is an opportunity for a sequel.</p></body></html>

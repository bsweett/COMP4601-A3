<meta name="summary" content="Mental Coitus Ala Scorsese: Definitely Takes The Scenic Route!!"></head><body><p>I rented this film the other night and though I wouldn't call it a bad movie<br />necessarily, I will say that it took the long route to get to the point!<br />They could've easily shaved off 20 to 25 minutes of this film,<br />tightened up the storyline and overall flow, and then I would've<br />said  "ANOTHER BRILLIANT SCORSESE MASTERPIECE!!"...but alas, I can't<br />call this one masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. (-:<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, Martin Scorsese is a true genius, a master<br />storyteller, and an icon of cinema whose work will be discussed and<br />studied for as long as there are people on earth who watch movies!<br />He has given us some truly brilliant films over the years, acted by some<br />of the most brilliant actors of our times...mainly one Robert DeNiro and<br />as of late, his new muse for the last few films, Leonardo DiCaprio,<br />who is cut from the same cloth of artistic excellence and total commitment<br />to whatever his current role requires.<br />But I'm a fan of Scorsese's more straight ahead masterworks like<br />"Taxi Driver", "Raging Bull", "King Of Comedy", "Casino" and of course,<br />"Goodfellas", which is argubly one of his best!<br />His films are always multi-layered, deep, well-developed, well-acted, etc.<br />even when they are straight ahead stories which everybody can follow and<br />get right into away. Even with those films, every time you watch them,<br />you catch a subtle nuance that you missed before that makes you like it even more.<br /><br />But as of his last few films, mainly "The Departed" as well as<br />"Shutter Island", I think he is taking the multi-dimensional thing a<br />bit too far and getting a little too cryptic for his own good!<br />Just my opinion. (Though I later came to appreciate "The Departed"<br />more with time and 3 or 4 viewings.)<br />To me, there is just too much going on in this story that,<br />by the time it all comes together in the end, it isn't as much a<br />surprise as it was a bit of a relief that the mental rollercoaster ride is over!<br />Yes, yes, I know...it's supposed to be a mind-boinking of sorts,<br />but it could've done it and brought us all to the money shot in<br />much less time than it did!<br />Having said that, I completely bought Leo DiCaprio's, Mark Ruffalo's<br />and Sir Ben Kinsley's performances hook line & sinker, and applaud them<br />for what they brought to it. There are some stunning visual sequences<br />as well, but the cinematography is usually always on point in a Scorsese film.<br />I must say though, that I'm much more happier that I rented it instead of<br />buying it just on the strength of Martin Scorsese's reputation.<br />(That's what happened when I bought "The Departed")<br />Again, I would hardly say this was a masterpiece, but it's<br />interesting enough to watch at least twice, then if you want to buy it for<br />your home DVD collection, then that's on you!

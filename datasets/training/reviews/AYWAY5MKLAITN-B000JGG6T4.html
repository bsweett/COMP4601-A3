Denzel plays a bodygruard chosen to protect a little girl of a rich political man. But when she gets kidnapped, and rumored to be dead, it's time for him to start asking some questions . . .the hard way. This is a story about no mercy. It's a story about the hard truth: That vengence only gets worse if your try and fight it.<br /><br />I don't think anybody could have put it better than Christopher walken: "This man is an artist. A killer. He's about to paint his masterpeice."</p></body></html>

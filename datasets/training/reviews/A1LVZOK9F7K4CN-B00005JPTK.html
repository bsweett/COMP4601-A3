<meta name="summary" content="The best movie version so far..."></head><body><p>Like most fans of horror literature, I've read the book, I Am Legend by Richard Matheson.  Matheson is (next to Lovecraft) the most important figure in horror in the twentieth century.  This famous book almost created the concept of "the last real human left on Earth."  In the book, it is vampires.  In the movies, they became "mutants," or zombies, or "the infected."<br /><br />This film gives us monsters who are a cross between vampires and zombies.  They are like vampires because they cannot be exposed to sunlight.  Otherwise, they are like the zombies of the 28 Days Later mold - exceptionally fast and strong.  (I still have a problem with fast, strong zombies - where do they get their strength from, especially considering they are so under-nourished.  But perhaps I am being too literal.)<br /><br />This movie works because the filmmakers choose to use suspense over cheap shocks.  It is amazing how long it takes to even see one of the monsters.  Most of the film is about Will Smith trying (and failing) to hold onto his sanity as he wonders through the surreally empty Manhattan.<br /><br />There are flaws in the film to be sure - mostly, some badly done CGI effects.  All in all, it works.  It is about time this film was made.  For years, it has been kicking around Hollywood attached to people like Schwarzenegger and so on.  It was even listed in an Entertainment Weekly article about the "best scripts never made."  Now, it has been made.  As a benefit, the book is popular again - and  whole generation of new readers will discover the old master.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="May Be A Good Movie If Only We Could Understand Language"></head><body><p>This may be a good movie.  We couldn't tell and gave up about 45 minutes into it.  We've had to do this on some other films from the UK too as we simply cannot understand most of what is being said.  This is because the film is using British working class accents (I don't know what else to call them) which we can't decipher.  I am writing this &quot;review&quot; simply to warn other viewers that if they have the same problem that we do, this film may be a bad choice for them.  I cannot review the other aspects of the movie since I have no idea of what was going on in a movie where I can't hear what they are saying.</p></body></html>

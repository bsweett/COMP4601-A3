But overall I was plesantly surpized with this latest Stephan King story brought to celluoid.  The effects are done well considering, the plot is very suspenciful (fear of the unknown), and the premise of how the mist/whats in the mist came to be is not explained but briefly suggested at and very interesting. I love movies that leave you thinking and captivated ie: 28 Days/Weeks Later and the Mist is no exception. Over all a great movie, this one will leave you captivated and looking over your shoulder and staying away from dark corners for days to come.  Great Job!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kind of scary, very gory..."></head><body><p>The original in a (so far) six-film series, this film is not a triumph in the horror movie genre, but it does have good themes as well as a menacing villain, Pinhead. It's watchable if you like this kind of stuff, but it gets a little ridiculous. Some neat-o special effects and lots of gore make this a horror fan's treat.</p></body></html>

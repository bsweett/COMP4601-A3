<meta name="summary" content="Comedies suck, some might be funny, but..."></head><body><p>one thing that is gauronteed with any comedy is that they are poorly made, poorly scripted, poorly acted, stupid wastes of money.  This movie is funny, so i guess you can say it does what is supposed to (make you laugh), but there is more to entertainment then stupid sex jokes, and the pain of others (funny but can carry a movie only so far), how about changing things up and making a comedy with a good script, good performances, different forms of humor(not just people getting hit in the face with a ball, it was funny but only after the first few times).  3 out of a 10, it made me laugh, but could have done more.</p></body></html>

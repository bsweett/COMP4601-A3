This film tries to be humerous and fails, tries to be serious and fails and trys to be a film and fails.  As one reviwer said "sassy pregnant teenage girls are so cool"<br /><br />I agree with the negitive reviews.  This film is for the sterotypical "Let's overrate stupid movies people".  This film has a plot and dialogue so stupid it makes my brain hurt.  This is alose the garbage that gets nominated for an oscar (anyone who's had to sit threw this film and can string two words together knows what I mean). You wonder how some films get made, or get good reviews when they are complete waste's of film, it's because of those people who love overhyped crappy movies. They will probally demand a sequel or a TV series. I can see it now "Juno II: Here We Go Again and Juno III: Third Times A Charm ***** two thumbs up amazing! Breath-taking!" GARBAGE!!!!</p></body></html>

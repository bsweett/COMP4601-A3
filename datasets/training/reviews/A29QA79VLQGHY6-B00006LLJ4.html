Director Spielberg has his say on the second (single layer) disc, which has a generous selection of bonus materials that are well organized and to the point. Menus have the nightmarish look of the &quot;precog&quot; visions that the film's cops use to predict and halt murders.<p>Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's other-worldly color scheme -- achieved via an unconventional &quot;bleach bypass&quot; on the negative stock -- comes across with all of its unsettling power. Blacks seem devoid of light, full of despair. The cobalt blues saturate the images, evoking the specter of a locked-and-loaded police state. <p>The DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound are typical of Spielberg's DVDs, with an upfront bias and subdued directional effects. The chilling subwoofer bottom keeps listeners on edge.<p>The featurette compilation opens and closes with Spielberg and Cruise exchanging superlatives (the package actually has a beginning, middle and end). Spielberg talks about how &quot;A.I.&quot; and &quot;Minority Report&quot; fit into his midlife vision quest. The director explains his &quot;dirty, ugly&quot; take on the future of U.S. society.<p>Wisely, most of the extras focus on the effects wizards and craftsmen who realized this future world. DVD content specialist Laurent Bouzereau keeps the featurettes moving along, with little time for the specialists to become tangled up in their thoughts. Fast-paced editing keeps the screen shots and on-set clips fresh.</p></body></html>

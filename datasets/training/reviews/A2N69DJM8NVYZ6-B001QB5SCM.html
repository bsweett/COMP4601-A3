<meta name="summary" content="Pretty bad movie"></head><body><p>I saw this movie on the plane to Europe and to tell you the truth I didn't like it at all. It's a bad story itself, but the actors were horrible. How could Cameron Diaz sleep with her sister's boyfriend? I think it's one of those movies that if you don't see you don't lose anything. It's bad, real bad.</p></body></html>

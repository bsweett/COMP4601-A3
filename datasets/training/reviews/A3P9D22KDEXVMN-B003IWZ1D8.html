<meta name="summary" content="Required Viewing"></head><body><p>Psycho is required viewing in more ways than one.  It literally was required for me recently in an American Cinema college class.  But even more importantly, the film is required viewing for any person interested in watching the incredible techniques used by Hitchcock during this film.  Even though I had watched Psycho several times before, it still had the ability to give me chills.  Watching the movie as a student/critic, it was nice to understand the variety of techniques that Hitchcock used from a learned perspective.  An incredible FIVE star film.</p></body></html>

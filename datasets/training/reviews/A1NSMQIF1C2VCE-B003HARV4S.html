<meta name="summary" content="A masterpiece"></head><body><p>Now this is the kind of movie that I hoped "Lady in the Water" would be: Magical, mysterious, incredibly stylish. One of the best movies that I've seen in years.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" takes a number of chances that shouldn't work -- How many great movies about the turn-of-the-century Austro-Hungarian Empire are there? And when's the last time there was a truly great movie about stage magic? -- and makes them all work. It even puts a former teen star/sex symbol in the leading female role and then shoots (almost) the entire film in sepia tone and with an early 20th century film vocabulary.<br /><br />It shouldn't work, but just like the tricks of Eisenheim the Illusionist, it does, and you find yourself marveling at the results. I don't want to give away too much of the plot -- its twists and "I can't believe he's doing that" element are a great part of the fun -- but Edward Norton portrays Eisenheim, a stage illusionist whom fate and the forbidden love of a duchess (the surprisingly believable Jessica Biel) puts on a collision course with the violent and amoral crown prince of the empire (Rufus Sewell). The movie is a cat and mouse game between the magician and prince, with the wonderful Paul Giamatti (playing a role very unlike his normal nebbishes) caught in the middle.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" gets the strongest possible recommendation for all audiences. (Even the sex scenes are 1920s fade-out tasteful.)</p></body></html>

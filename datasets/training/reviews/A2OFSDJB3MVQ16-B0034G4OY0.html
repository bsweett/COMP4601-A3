<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood's most mis-understood movie of all time"></head><body><p>I guess many people were bewildered and perplexed when this film came out because I think they were expecting an action film or suspense since Eastwood is the director.  But one thing one can expect from this renowned director is the unexpected!!  I've seen this film twice in a theater and plan to view again on Blu-ray, it's a thought provoking drama of a dimension we rarely experience but does exist--the afterlife!!  Matt Damon and Cecile DeFrance are excellent in their roles as a psychic and a survivor who experiences the after-life.  Along with "Inception", this is one of the most original films from a well respected director--and it accomplishes what it set out to do--and this is to make us think!!  Perhaps years from now it will be held in higher regard as witness Hitchcock's "Vertigo" and "Marnie".  Kudos to Clint for bringing this subject to the screen.</p></body></html>

Sadly, it didn't measure up to my expectations.  It was too derivative and depended too much on special effects-laden fight sequences.<p>Ron Perlman plays Hellboy as if he were Benjamin Grimm/The Thing from "The Fantastic Four": a mixture of bravado and pathos.  It's not surprising that the actor was able to exude some humanity under all that red makeup; he has made a career out of playing costumed characters ("Beauty and the Beast", "The Island of Dr. Moreau", "Star Trek: Nemesis").  <p>In addition to Hellboy the only other notable character was "Abe Sapien", physically performed by Doug Jones and voiced" by "Frasier's" David Hyde Pierce.  The character's screen time is limited but memorable.<p>Hopefully, in the sequel (and I'm sure that there will be one) there will be greater development of the Hellboy character, the most interesting comic hero in some time.</p></body></html>

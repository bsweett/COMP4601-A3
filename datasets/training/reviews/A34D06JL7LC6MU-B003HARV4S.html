<meta name="summary" content="The Illusionist"></head><body><p>The 1st of 2 magician-oriented period pieces to come out in 2006 is "The Illusionist" starring Edward Norton, Jessica Biel, and Paul Giamatti. Compared to the other film "The Prestige" it's not quite as good, but nevertheless...I enjoyed it a lot. Sporting an English accent and a beard, Norton plays Eisenheim the Illusionist who frequently amazes the city of Vienna with his realistic trickery. The movie opens with Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) arresting Eisenheim at one of his performances and the movie flashes back to show us why. One night, during a performance Eisenheim is reunited with a childhood acquaintance in the form of Duchess Sophie (Biel), who is engaged to marry Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). Despite this, Sophie and Eisenheim begin having an affair, which leads to Sophie being murdered by Leopold. Inspector Uhl, who is caught in the middle of all this, begins investigating the murder while Eisenheim appears to be resurrecting her at his shows. The movie's climax is a "twist" that bares some similarity to the ending of "The Prestige." Both endings are good, but a bit contrived and don't make a whole lot of sense. They do, but it seems too unbelievable. The movie is beautiful and, at times, has the look of an old silent film. All the performances are good, especially Norton and Giamatti. Biel, who is frequently bashed by critics, is actually really good and really hot. Sewell always makes a top-notch villain (except in "The Legend of Zorro") and looks kind of Vincent Gallo-ish. The movie's very entertaining, even if you're not into period pieces where people wear makeup on their chest and write with feathers. The movie is not perfect (more worthy of 4 1/2 stars), but it's one of the best movies I've seen from 2006.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

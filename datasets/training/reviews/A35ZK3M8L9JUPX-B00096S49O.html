<meta name="summary" content="Hitch (Fullscreen Edition)"></head><body><p>In New York, Alex Hitchen is a kind of sentimental advisor, teaching each client how to date the woman of his dream. His present case is helping the clumsy Albert to date the wealthy and powerful Allegra Cole. Meanwhile, Hitch has a crush on the gossip columnist Sara, who was assigned to write about Allegra. When the best girlfriend of Sara has a love disillusion with a man that Sara thinks that is a client of Hitch, she plots a revenge against Hitch and the misunderstanding leads the two couples to a conflictive situation. From the opening credits to the closing, I was laughing all through. There is something in this movie for everyone.  The cast has great chemistry. This movie has comedy as well as a metaphor. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.</p></body></html>

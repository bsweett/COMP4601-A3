This movie is just so well-written and acted that I was willing to go through the experience. And in a way it is about anti-escapism, set as it is in Hawaii, with George Clooney's character bitterly noting in the opening voiceover that his friends on the mainland think his life must be heaven, living in paradise as he does, but don't they realize that people still suffer, and break each other's hearts, and die?<br /><br />For those who don't know, the plot of this movie (although 'plot' is not quite the right word) is that Clooney's character's wife is in a coma, and soon to be dead. He has to deal with this, and the reality of their troubled marriage which he will now never get to save, along with explaining it to his troubled daughters, ages 10 and 17, other family members, and friends. There is also a backstory involving valuable land his family owns, and is considering selling. I don't want to give everything away, but the essence is that this is a rich and quirky cast of characters, where no one is perfect and everyone is struggling to understand what is happening and how to connect, and forgive.<br /><br />The writing, the acting, the tone and the filming are all exactly right. It's a real film about real people, with no special effects, and grounded in the realities of life - both the harshest and most beautiful realities - and that makes it very special, and well-worth the praise it has received.</p></body></html>

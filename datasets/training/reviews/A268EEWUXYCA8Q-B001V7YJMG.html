<meta name="summary" content="A fantastic film with a terrible DVD/Blu ray translation issue"></head><body><p>Obviously, there's a huge uproar over the terrible injustice Magnolia did to this film.  Instead of keeping the much superior translation used in the theatre version, they redid it with one that is nowhere near as good.  It's unfortunate.  If that's something you're interested in, then maybe you should skip this film for the time being.  The following review is of the film, leaving the controversy to the side since that's being expertly covered already here at Amazon.com.<br /><br />Let the Right One in...what a fantastic film.  After watching the film, I didn't quite know what to say.  I think Roger Ebert said it best:<br /><br />"Remove the vampire elements, and this is the story of two lonely and desperate kids capable of performing dark deeds without apparent emotion. Kids washed up on the shores of despair. The young actors are powerful in draining roles. We care for them more than they care for themselves. Alfredson's palette is so drained of warm colors that even fresh blood is black."<br /><br />So, yes.  It's about a vampire.  But it's not really.  On one hand, it's a harsh coming of age story for Oskar, a young boy caught between two separated parents who don't really seem to care for him, a school that seems to ignore him, bullies that want to do not nice things to him and a vampire that wants...well, what does she/it want?  Eli, that would be the vampire, meets Oskar one night after she moved in next door to him.  She appears to be about his age, but there's something decidedly off about her.  She lives with a vaguely creepy older man, who goes out and does unspeakable things at night to feed her.  She, like Oskar, exists in a world that ignores her---unless of course they discover what she is, and then I'm sure the world would be filled with more than just bullies.<br /><br />She tells Oskar he needs to stand up for himself and he does, which leads him along a messed up journey of self-discovery and growing up.  This isn't a heart-warming story (or is it?).  Its vampires don't sparkle.  Of course, with the washed out, cold colors Alfredson paints the story with, nothing does.  This is further exemplified with this excellent Blu Ray transfer.  The film looks so cold, I expected frost on my TV.  The brilliant color scheme is used very effectively and is only heightened with the pitch perfect transfer.  Definitely recommend this version.<br /><br />At the center of this movie is, I think, a question.  Does Eli, the girl vampire who says she isn't a girl, really love Oskar?  Or is she manipulating him to be her next caretaker?  Can she even love?  I don't know.  And I'm still uncertain by the movie's end, though I have a good feeling I know.  Regardless, it's a terrific film acted by surprisingly excellent child actors.  And I'd recommend watching it.</p></body></html>

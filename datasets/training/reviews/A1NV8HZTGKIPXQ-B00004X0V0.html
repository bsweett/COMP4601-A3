There had to of been a couple of raised eyebrows when people first heard of this big screen pairing. What will these two be like together?. Some might've thought it was a recipe for disaster. On the contrary. Jones and Smith clicked. They just melted together like butter. Sure the effects and make-up and all that was fun and well done, but it's the on screen chemistry of this new duo that makes this film the fun it is. Director Barry Sonnenfeld(The Addams Family movies, Get Shorty, Big Trouble)directs this highly entertaining summer movie that is one heck of a pleasing journey. Will Smith plays a rookie cop who is recruited by the MIB to work opposite Agent K(Jones)to keep track of aliens on earth. Their main adversary here is an alien who has inhabited the body of a farmer, played hysterically by Vincent D'Onofrio. D'Onofrio is quite incredible as the human taken over by the alien. The skin doesn't fit right and he is rapidly decaying. Gross and funny. Rip Torn is on hand as the leader of the MIB group. Linda Fiorentino shows up as well as Dr. Laurel Weaver. Another familiar face here is Tony Shalhoub("Wings", "Thirteen Ghosts", "Big Night")as an alien passing as a human. Smith and Jones know better. The make-up is very good. The effects are satisfying. The movie moves along at a nice rate where there isn't much time for the film to slag, or the audience to wander off. It's brisk and enjoyable. This is a film that could almost of been directed by Tim Burton. Burton's longtime composer, and musical genius, Danny Elfman, composed the movie with the great kind of score we come to expect from him. Again, this movie really lies in the hands of Jones and Smith. They deliver some great comic moments. It just comes across as very natural. It's nice to see the notoriously serious Tommy Lee do something funny. "Men In Black II" looks like it will uphold the tradition of this first film too. I hope it can keep the same kind of fun/cool of this one. That's what this movie and others like it are for. They are not here to be overly analyzed and taken seriously. Look at some of the more harsher reviews and you'll know what I mean. You have to go to a summery like popcorn movie and know that you are seeing a summery popcorn movie. It can be a good, intelligent, well done movie without having some Oscar-worthy plot. You gotta know that going in. Anyways, this is a fun treat for anyone who likes fun entertainment. Who doesn't?.</p></body></html>

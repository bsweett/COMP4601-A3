<meta name="summary" content="for the blu-ray not the movie"></head><body><p>I've already given this movie a 4 star rating with the regular DVD review so the 3 star is for the blu-ray transfer.This is probly the worst movie I've seen on blu-ray so far that was made in the past 10 years.The video is only slightly,slightly better than DVD and thats just becouse the colors are a tad bit more vibrant.The sound is standard 5.1,no uncompressed or TruHD.Maybe if this is the first time your buying this movie get the blu-ray but if you have the DVD I would suggest stay with that.</p></body></html>

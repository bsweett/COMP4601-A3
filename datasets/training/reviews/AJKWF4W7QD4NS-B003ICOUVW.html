Benicio Del Toro stars as Lawrence Talbot, who upon his return to his ancestral home after the brutal death of his brother, finds himself at odds with his father (Anthony Hopkins) and yearning for his dead brother's fiance (Emily Blunt).  Before you know it, he is bitten by the beast responsible for his brother's demise, and it isn't long before the curse of the werewolf has befallen Lawrence as well.  Anything that The Wolfman offers is nothing that hasn't been seen before in just about any and all werewolf flicks to see the light of day since the original 1941 classic was originally unleashed.  There is a heaping amount of blood and gore effects to satisfy nearly any gorehound, albeit some of the CGI wolf effects leave quite a bit to be desired.  That being said, Rick Baker's prosthetic effects are spectacular, while the film's cinematography and set design pay wonderful homage to the original film.  Del Toro, who bears a striking resemblance to Lon Chaney, is good, but it's Anthony Hopkins, who delivers such a memorable, albeit hammy, performance.  All in all, The Wolfman is nowhere near as mediocre as many have proclaimed it to be, and it deserves to be checked out at the very least, especially if you're any kind of a horror fan in the least.</p></body></html>

It was a very difficult day, and reliving it through a movie was not my idea of entertainment.  But having heard good things about the film, I sat down and watched.  The movie seemed very realistic.  Almost as if there had documentary crews on the plane, in the FAA, and scattered among the various military and civilian places covered in the movie.  The movie covers the anarchy of the military and flight controllers trying to handle a totally unique situation, and the brave people of United 93 who chose to fight back.  The movie makes no judgements of right or wrong and churns along straight ahead.  It is a strong film about that terrible day, but it is also a powerful film about the human spirit.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's About Friendship"></head><body><p>This was certainly an unusual little movie that I missed in the theaters.  It involves a chance meeting between a down on his luck salesman(Kinnear) and a burned out assassin(Brosnan) and the unusual friendship they develop.  I think Pierce steals the movie with his assassin with issues character.  Kinnear is very good as well in his role.  I really enjoy him in this offbeat roles.  Little Miss Sunshine is another good movie with him.  This was a fun and interesting movie.  It is about the characters developing and wanting just to achieve what they each perceive as success.  Though it is a drama, it is sprinkled with enough humor to keep it from getting too dark.  Worth a watch.</p></body></html>

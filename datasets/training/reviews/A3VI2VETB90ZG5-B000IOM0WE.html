<meta name="summary" content="Great Picture, Great Action...A Keeper!"></head><body><p>The HD DVD version of this film (the only version I've seen) is easy to look at - the film is very well done by all parties involved.<br /><br />The story is definitely worthy of the big screen. The 5.1 audio tracks are very clean and captivating. The great HD picture comes through crisp and bright, clean and awesome.<br /><br />I have never seen the animated series so I have no comments about its similarities, but I consider this film a keeper for the collection that I can watch again in the future and still enjoy it.<br /><br />"Aeon Flux" offers a nice variety of well executed, pulse quickening action sequences, coupled with brilliant performances by a great cast. What you end up with is an hour and thirty-two minutes of excellent action-packed film!<br /><br />I'm glad I bought it.<br /><br />If you enjoy TV's "Alias" (please no comparison follow-ups, I'm not comparing) you may likely enjoy "Aeon Flux" - not that they're the same thing, but there is this mission...with a captivating female lead...this one's a bit more on the sci-fi side, though...I don't want to blow it for anyone, just go out and get it if that kind of premise piques your interest in any way. If you're curious so far, you can pretty much count on enjoying the movie.</p></body></html>

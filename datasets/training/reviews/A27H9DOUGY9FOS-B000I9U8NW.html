<meta name="summary" content="Comic Fluff For The Kiddies"></head><body><p>Films based on comic books are a bit of a mixed bag.  While never my favorite genre, the stakes have been raised in recent years.  With sophisticated outings such as "Batman Begins", "X-Men 2", and "Spiderman 2" and "Superman Returns", it seems that we've ushered in an age of comic book adaptations as art.  These films surprised me and entertained me (as any movie should), but also utilized real drama, intelligence and adult sensibilities--often with great performances and smart, logical scripts.  Even graphic novels have become a popular source for serious minded films.<br /><br />So "The Fantastic Four" is a throwback.  Far from sophisticated, it plays as a live action cartoon.  That might be OK, but the more pressing problem is that it's not particularly fun either.  I know a lot of people feel that "The Incredibles" borrowed heavily from "The Fantastic Four" concept, and maybe so.  But at least on film "The Incredibles" was rousing entertainment.  Maybe the film "Fantastic Four" should have taken that cue.<br /><br />I won't blame the actors.  I actually like many of them (in other roles).  It's a lackluster, sloppy script.  The filmmakers never really cared about this subject and it shows.  First and foremost, they wanted a commercial film to play to a mass audience--kiddies included.  And I can imagine small children getting a few chuckles from The Human Torch and The Thing.  Their interactions, after all, are the equivalent of junior high taunting.  But it's just not funny enough, the effects aren't original enough, and it sure lacks a brain.  Put the small kids in front of it--it's harmless enough, but you probably don't want to invest your time with "The Fantastic Four".  KGHarris, 10/06.</p></body></html>

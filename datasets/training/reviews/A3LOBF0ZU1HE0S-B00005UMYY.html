<meta name="summary" content="An absorbing and unforgetable piece of modern cinema"></head><body><p>Playing in rewind, this film tells the story of ex-insurance investigator Leonard (Guy Pearce) with an uncontrolable case of &quot;short-term&quot; memory lose lives for only one purpose, to find and kill the man who raped and &quot;murdered&quot; his wife, using tattoed notes on his body as his only source of progress. An deniably interesting and gripping thriller loaded with many mixed elements of film noir, astonishing performances and an uncountable number of twists and turns that it packs a punch right in the viewers face.<br />This DVD edition is a delightful treat for such an outstanding film. Razor sharp picture and crystal clear sound, informative IFC (Independent Film Channel) interview with director Christopher Nolan, theatrical trailer and TV spot, trailer for director's earlier feature &quot;Following&quot;, interesting and somewhat creepy tattoo gallery and director and cast biographies. A must have DVD for anyone who owns a player.</p></body></html>

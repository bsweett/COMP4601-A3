<meta name="summary" content="Not your typical alien movie!"></head><body><p>An alien ship lands on Johanessberg and somehow was shutdown for 20 years. The aliens inhabitting it got out of the ship with the help of humans only to be living afterwards in a huge slum area called District 9. One human working for the MNU (multinational united), which is an organizaiton responsible for communicating with aliens, gets infected by an alien substance that causes his body to gradually transform into an alien being. By that happening to him, he is the only human being able to operate on the aliens weapons and machines, and therefore became a  target for all human organizations and companies interested in learning alien technology. He became their target, at all costs.<br /><br />This movie is different in the sense that it makes you side with the aliens against humans. You see the world through their eyes.<br />You also see that they are so fragile and weak without their technology, like humans.<br /><br />The movie is ok, I justed hated the way the aliens looked. They looked like the starwars creatures of Tattoine. I would have appreciated it more if they looked like the alien being usually described by those claiming to have encountered them (tall, grey, with big eyes).</p></body></html>

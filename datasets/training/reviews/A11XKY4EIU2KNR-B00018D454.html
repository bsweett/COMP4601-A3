<meta name="summary" content="The original slasher returns!!!!"></head><body><p>Before the days of Jason Voorhees, Freddy Kruger, and even Michael Myesr, there was Leatherface and the rest of the HeWitt family. This is a great remake of the original 1974 film of the same name.<br /><br />The film starts out with a group of teenagers traveling through Texas in a van on their way to a Lynard Skynard concert. They pick up a young dazed blonde womkan who obviously needs help. As she rides in the backseat, she puts a .38 special in her mouth and pulls the trigger. This sets off a chain of events that lead them on the path to meet the HeWitt clan.<br /><br />R. Lee Ermey, everybody's favorite Marine Corps drill instructor, plays the insane sheriff who is really part of this cannibalistic clan.<br /><br />Leatherface is huge, mean, and can slice and dice better than ever before. When he doesn't have the chainsaw, he's just as handy with a sledgehammer and a sewing machine.<br /><br />Jessica Biel is our heroine and she looks great, especially towards the end when she is soaking wet and the tank top gets tighter and tighter, she certainly is the eye candy of this flick.<br /><br />Do I like it as much as the original? Yes and no. The original is a classic and I love it, but seeing a reborn Leatherface in the next century brings me a strange sense of peace. If I am not mistaken, and I will have to watch both movies back to back, I think the gas station is the same in both movies. Nice touch.</p></body></html>

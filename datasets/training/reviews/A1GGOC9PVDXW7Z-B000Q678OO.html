<meta name="summary" content=""Goodness is something to be chosen. When a man cannot choose he ceases to be a man.""></head><body><p>In Stanley Kubrick's chilling adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, an ultra-violent sociopathic hooligan named Alex, who murders a woman in her home, has his 15 year prison sentence set aside when he submits to the Ludovico Technique. This method of aversion brainwashing renders him incapable of committing violence, touching women or enjoying his beloved "lovely, lovely Ludwig van." An unforeseen result of his behavior modification is that Alex becomes a pawn of those trying to overthrow the Interior Minister and his government.<br /><br />One of the finest soundtracks ever includes several pieces by Wendy Carlos. Kubrick's absolute best!<br /><br />I saw this futuristic frighter at an afternoon matinee during its first week of release. It's a vivid 40-year-old memory due to the unique conditions of that showing, which was at a first generation multiplex called the Showcase Cinemas. The projectionist who ran it must've really loved "Clockwork Orange," for the sound was turned up louder than on any movie I had seen before or have been to since. The deafening roar in that top-of-the-line auditorium stays with me 40 years later, as does the sympathetic nausea I experienced with Alex while the disconcerting Wendy Carlos piece, "Timesteps" blared and in a special movie just for his clamped open eyes the "red, red krovy ran real harasho."<br /><br />End results: 1.) I left the theater with my head a-spin and hearing slightly damaged. 2.) Saw this film a dozen times more that year but was disappointed when the audio was never as loud. 3.) The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002KDU">A CLOCKWORK ORANGE</a> Motion Picture Soundtrack is an all-time personal favorite. (That Ludovico stuff really works!)<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.5) A Clockwork Orange (UK/USA-1971) - Malcolm McDowell/Patrick Magee/Sheila Raynor/Philip Stone/Michael Bates/Warren Clarke/Aubrey Morris/Anthony Sharp/Warren Clarke/James Marcus</p></body></html>

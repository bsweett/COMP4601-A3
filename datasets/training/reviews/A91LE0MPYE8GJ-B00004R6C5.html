<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie"></head><body><p>After reading the 1960 book I wanted to watch the movie, so our class watched it. I liked the movie but what I say, &quot;Books are better then the movie,&quot; If they were to remake, this it would be PG-13 or R. So before you watch the movie, read the book. The actors did very well. enjoy</p></body></html>

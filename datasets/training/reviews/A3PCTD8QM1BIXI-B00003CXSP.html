When one just looks into the eyes of Hannibal you see get a sense of true fear. The direction in this film is great and the acting is once again superb. The jump scenes are right on target and the effectiveness is once again good. Anthony Hopkins is great as always as is Juilanne Moore. Ray Liolta and an uncredited Gary Oldman make good villians also.</p></body></html>

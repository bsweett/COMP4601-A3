This movie's got it all: exotic and mysterious settings, close calls, elaborate booby traps, shootouts, fistfights, chases, and that joyous sense of awe and discovery.  The movie's standout sequence is the famous desert chase, with Indy hanging off the side of the side, in front of, below, and behind a Nazi truck!  With all the fantastic action and stunts, it's even more amazing that what makes Raiders stand out is Harrison Ford's perfect performance.  John Williams' rousing score makes the already thrilling action scenes even more exciting.<br />*****/*****<p>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom-The first of the Indy sequels has caught an undeserved rep.  Much like say, The Matrix Reloaded, the consensus is that this is a good, solid sequel, but good is disappointing when compared to the ground-breaking original.  But I'm afraid I can't agree.  Even though Temple of Doom boasts a slightly less solid plot than Raiders of the Lost Ark, this is an even faster-paced, equally wonderful movie experience.  Harrison Ford matches his first performance with a touch more humor and he's got a great sidekick in Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), a young Chinese kid who holds his own next to Indy.  John Williams' score is somehow even better and the action setpieces are eye-poppingly spectacular.  Not only are there the "usual" shootouts and fistfights, Jones is also trapped in a mid-air freighter with no fuel, goes through a literal rollercoaster ride on a mine cart, and literally hangs off a cliff with hungry alligators below!  The last half-hour is just non-stop excitement, the greatest extended action sequence in cinematic history.<br />*****/*****<p>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade-My personal favorite of the series, Indy's quest for the Holy Grail is the most fun one can have watching a movie. Except for the climactic tank chase, none of the action here really surpases what was accomplished in Temple of Doom  in terms of sheer thrills (though a motorcycle chase and zeppelin battle come close), but that's okay.  The point of The Last Crusade is that it intends to be a more mature and character-oriented addition to the trilogy.  The addition of Sean Connery was a brilliant movie; he makes a wonderful dramatic and comedic duo with Harrison Ford.  Ford, in particular, delivers the best and most difficult performance of his career.  Difficult, you say, but he's just reprising a role he's played twice before, right?  True, but this time he has to craft Jones as a character with his own flaws and demons (exemplified by his strained relationship with his father) while still maintaining the larger-than-life action heroics.  He pulls it off with flying colors.<br />*****/*****<p>Directed by Steven Spielberg, the trilogy remains the greatest example of Hollywood movie magic, proving the filmmaker's talents for recreating the sense of joy that we all thought we could only feel as children.  Nice to see there's someone out there who knows how to make us feel like kids again.</p></body></html>

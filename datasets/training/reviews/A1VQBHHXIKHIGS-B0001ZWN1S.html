<meta name="summary" content="The Godfather"></head><body><p>I saw it for the first time. No, this is not a misprint. Brando was brilliant. Yep, my first time seeing him in a film. I don't feel I have to tell you what made this film so compelling. But, seeing as how I'm milking my "redneck in China" and "grits with chopsticks" bit for all it's worth right now, I'll mention juxtapositions. Like watching PURPLE RAIN and THE GODFATHER as a double feature. Who else does that? Both films are stylized, and understandably dated in a few spots. And I thought PURPLE RAIN was too violent? I stand corrected.<br /><br />Juxtapositions of the American Dream, la cosa nostra, and Catholic old Italy. When Michael Corleone went into exile in Sicily, and learned all the men had been killed in vendettas, the first memorial he saw was to Alfredo LaRocca. When he courted Apollonia, I almost spit out my dentures. Prince courted Apollonia. Anyone who would marry Vito Corleone's daughter is insane. We should only watch the Corleones from a safe distance. Godfather-in-law? Yikes.<br /><br />I have THE GODFATHER 2 and THE GODFATHER 3, but I won't get to them right away. I've heard 2 is better than 1, but I hope you understand why I'm skeptical. If you've seen 1, that is. They killed off Brando. Jeez. Great juxtaposition, dying while playing with his grandson.</p></body></html>

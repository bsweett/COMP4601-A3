<meta name="summary" content="Like Tony Stark, Iron Man 2 is good, but flawed"></head><body><p>The first Iron Man was and still is a very strong comic book film. It would have been the best of 2008 by far if not for a little movie called The Dark Knight. Now, a couple of years later we have the two leads back with a number of new big name additions, and some impressive CGI as expected.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. continues to shine as Tony Stark, with an ego the size of the planet, and Gwyneth Paltrow still has great chemistry with him. Add to the mix a neat villain, Whiplash, played by the always excellent Mickey Rourke, the lovely Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Don Cheadle as Rhodey/War Machine, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, and Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. You won't find a film in this genre with a cast list this strong. Even though it felt like Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johannson were stuck in here just for a reference towards The Avengers movie of the future, it worked for me, especially Scarlett's fight scene towards the end. Don Cheadle was a great choice for replacing Terrence Howard. I'm still not sure why they got rid of him, but I didn't miss his feminine voice one bit. For me, as great as Robert Downey is in this role, both villains stole the show. The brilliant choice to underplay the part worked wonders for Mickey Rourke. His muscular body, covered head to toe in tattoos, along with his multi-colored hair, gold teeth, Russian accent, toothpick, and complete with a parrot on his shoulder, made him one of the most interesting characters for appearances alone. He could have gone way overboard with this character, but he keeps his cool and is even more believable for it. Sam Rockwell has always been an actor that may not have name recognition to everyone, but from the time I first saw him in The Green Mile until last years Moon, he turns in one solid performance after the next. He is like a darker version of Tony Stark, complete with a large personality and more than his share of funny lines.<br /><br />I have only a few gripes. I didn't care for the pacing. It seemed much longer than two hours and I typically have no problem watching long movies. Compared to the first Iron Man, some scenes were closing in on boring, but thankfully what works here, works really well. The dialogue was pretty strong and often very funny, but the script as a whole could have been thought out a little better. There is almost too much going on and too many people to fit into one story. Like the previous film, there is also a lack of action. The story always comes first, but this sequel could have let loose a whole lot more. When it does, you get some real good stuff, like the scene with Whiplash slicing up the race cars.<br /><br />As far as sequels go, Iron Man 2 is better than most, but it's not everything it could have been, or what most people were hoping for. Still, it's a fun ride from start to finish and a great way to start off the summer movie season.</p></body></html>

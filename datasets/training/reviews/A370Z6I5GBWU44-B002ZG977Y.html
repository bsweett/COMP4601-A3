<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly enjoyable"></head><body><p>This story does not adhere strictly to Greek Mythology, and if you can get past that, then this movie is actually very enjoyable although there are a couple of loose ends that are never tied up (namely, Io)<br /><br />Hades as the bad guy? The poor god is woefully typecast, he always seems to be the bad guy in adaptations and films based off Greek myths. But I will say, his cinder-and-smoke cloak looked pretty cool, great CGI there. I didn't like his hair and face, though - the makeup and hair seemed rather inappropriate for him. The story itself is fairly enjoyable, and the special effects are awesome. The CGI Medusa is especially impressive and makes her look real. This movie is worth watching again, but not too many times.</p></body></html>

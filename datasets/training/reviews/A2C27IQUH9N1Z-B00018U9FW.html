He's been kicked out of his band and is facing eviction by his roommates when he decides to impersonate his friend, a substitute teacher, and try to make a few bucks.  As you'd expect, he's not much of a teacher -- UNTIL he discovers that his middle school charges are gifted classical musicians and he decides to indoctrinate them into the world of rock so they can participate in an upcoming Battle of the Bands.<p>The role was written for Black by actor-writer Mike White (The Good Girl), one of the most interesting screenwriters in Hollywood, and Black is perfect -- believably crotchety and endearing -- with a flawless supporting cast.  The kids, musicians found in band camps and similar venues, do a great job, while Joan Cusack as the school's uptight principal, and White and Sarah Silverman as Dewey's roommates, never hit a wrong note.<p>Directed by Richard Linklater (Clerks), the film is paced well, thoroughly enjoyable, and filled with great music, culminating in a great Battle of the Bands and a fun jam session over the closing credits.<p>DVD extras include a terrific commentary track with Black and Linklater (too bad White is missing); a commentary track with the kids; a 25-minute behind-the-scenes featurette that shows how funny Black is and how close the cast was; an hilarious pitch by Jack Black to Led Zeppelin; a music video; trailer; a 16-minute MTV diary; an 8-minute video diary of the kids at the Toronto Film Festival; and the film's awesome History of Rock chart, unfortunately available only to Windows users.<p>The film is great fun for the whole family, Black and his supporting cast are terrific, and the dvd extras rock!  Can't go wrong.</p></body></html>

OK, take three stone symbols which are a key to a protective weapon useable to keep away some nasty aliens who want to take the world, add in sexy girl (Milla Jovovich) who is a guardian of the weapon, a taxi driver (Bruce Willis), more aliens, some priests who know the secrets, an evil traitor working with the bad aliens and you have a really wild sci-fi story. Oh, it all takes place on the Earth in the dstant future. Did I mention the taxi moves in all 3 dimensions?<br /><br />An expansive vision of a whole different Earth with many different types of beings. Bruce Willis does a great job in the Sci-Fi movie. Really good story and well executed. Extensive special effects and really wild sets. This is a must see sci-fi movie!</p></body></html>

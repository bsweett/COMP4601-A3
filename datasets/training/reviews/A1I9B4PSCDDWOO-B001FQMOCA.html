<meta name="summary" content="Not as great as many says...."></head><body><p>I will probably write a minority review here. This biopic starring Joaquin Phoenix as the famous country singer, Johnny Cash looked very much like a clone of last year biopic, Ray. We got the same theme here, poor upbringing, childhood guilt trip, drug addiction, making it big and losing his family at the same time and the both films end around the same time period, never going into their mature years. Only major differences between the two movies were the color of their skin and sound of their music. The major reason why this movie wasn't an one star movie for all this copycat format was that Reese Witherspoon gave a real fantastic performance as June Carter. While Joaquin Phoenix was good, I didn't think he was great. Witherspoon proves to totally effective and she virtually overshadowed Phoenix in almost every scene they were together. She brought this movie up to a high level by her performance which I thought to be authentic, well interpret and settled. While this may sound bit unfair to Phoenix since he had the hardest job of capturing Johnny Cash without mimicking him, I thought he didn't do that good of job. Maybe the script let him down on that issue.<br /><br />Both of them were well supported by their fellow cast members. The music production was very good and it told the musical story very well. But the script was bit on the weak side. Movie seem to go from episode to episode, home scene to music scene and so on. What made Johnny Cash tick? What were his motivations? Answers seem very superficial here. There just wasn't any major surprises in the movie and although my knowledge of Johnny Cash came from only one book and two CDs, I didn't see him too well on the movie screen.<br /><br />Outside of Witherspoon's superb performance, this movie is basically by the number routine. Isn't there a music star out there who didn't have poor upbringing, who didn't have some sort of childhood guilt trip, who wasn't a drug or alcohol abuser and didn't lose his family when he made it big???</p></body></html>

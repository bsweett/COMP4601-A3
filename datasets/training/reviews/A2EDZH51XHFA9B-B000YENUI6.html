(Scanners, Sept. 10, 2007) And yes, Eastern Promises joins that very small list of modern movies-- They Live, Girlfight, Fight Club-- that will give you a bloody nose just watching them. (Oddly, I haven't seen anyone comparing the fight scene in Eastern Promises to its obvious cognate in A History of Violence, the infamous scene on the stairs.) Looking at the fight, by itself, is a good way to drive into the core of David Cronenberg's genius, the uncanny ability to unnerve us with the body that he's displayed in the thirty-two years between his first big-screen production, Shivers, and now. Cronenberg is an auteur of bodily horror; even if he seems to have retired from the explicitly-gross genre after the beautiful, underrated eXistenZ and gone into the more mainstream thriller, these scenes have the same effect, albeit more muted, than the shocking birth scene of The Brood or the head explosion in Scanners: scenes that are no less shocking thirty years later, despite so many pale imitations, and despite our tolerance as a culture for movie violence being so much higher than it was in the late seventies.<br /><br />Eastern Promises is, at its heart, a love story, just as A History of Violence was before it (and, for that matter, as The Brood was before that). It starts when Russian gangster Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen, whose penchant for accents never fails to amaze me) meets Anna (Naomi Watts), a midwife who discovers the diary of a woman who died in childbirth and wants to return it to the woman's family. The contents of the diary, when translated, tie the leader of the gang Mortensen's working to the child. After finding out Anna's Russian uncle read the diary, the gang leader (Armin Mueller-Stahl) orders the uncle killed, and the thriller part of the film begins. But-- and this is odd for a Cronenberg film-- the thriller plot almost takes a backseat to the relationship between Nikolai and Anna, who are so obviously meant for one another and, of course, can't be together.<br /><br />Ah, but then there's the fight scene, which is at best tangential, but during which Cronenberg's body horror resuscitates itself and comes roiling to the fore. The actors themselves did the entire scene, no stuntmen, and if the sound effects were later overdubbed, they were overdubbed with the actual sounds of fists on flesh, which are so notably absent (replaced by more dramatic sound effects) from so many other films. It's the fight scene that shows us Cronenberg's attention to detail and passion for realism in his films, even when those films are far beyond the bounds of the real. It's these things that made me see films such as Scanners and Videodrome as successes, back when I first saw them (and, still, today; Scanners sits high on my list of the best movies ever made). And when you take such a philosophy and put it into a film that actually realistic, how can you not come up with a winner?<br /><br />The movie does everything Hollywood doesn't. It's tense without consciously creating tension, dramatic without consciously creating drama. It's a love story that has no love whatsoever in it, just two people who are civil to one another when they should by rights be clawing each other's eyes out. How it can work, and work so very well, is something Hollywood has forgotten, and it's why I find myself liking so many foreign films better than their Hollywood cognates. (Eastern Promises, done by a Canadian director and filmed entirely on location in London, written by a British guy, is foreign enough to count as foreign, for the purposes of this discussion.) Those of you who previously dismissed Cronenberg as a horror director, it's time to go back and re-evaluate his new career as a director of crime thrillers; perhaps, once you see what he's on about here, you'll find yourself with a great deal more appreciation for what he did in his older movies. ****</p></body></html>

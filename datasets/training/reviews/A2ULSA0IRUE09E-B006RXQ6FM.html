<meta name="summary" content=""Doubt" : Trying Desperately to make a Point"></head><body><p>This movie was intriguing to me because of the presence of Meryl, whom I think has had some really stellar movie roles (other than her turn in "Mamma Mia", which I didn't quite like). However, there was *something* about this film and especially her performance that seemed altogether redundant. I have never seen Meryl work so hard at 'trying' to be a character, rather than just 'be' that character. It was amazing to watch. And for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />I must say the only saving grace is Amy Adams, who is excellent as a confused and morally divided person who prefers believing the easiest explanation. On one hand, the movie wants to work as a moral tale to demonstrate that even in these so-called religious institutions, no one is sure of anything, let alone God and various forms of philosophy. On the other, it is determined to work as a star vehicle for Streep, who pouts, slams and overacts throughout the entire film - with almost no real punch to it.<br /><br />That this is considered 'serious cinema' is sad. Yes, the 'shocking' confrontation between Streep and Viola Davis is interesting only because' of the Davis characters' reaction, but once you move past that, its amazing that Viola even garnered an Oscar nomination for barely ten minutes on screen (she was good, but not great). Bewildering. Its amazing what nonsense can pass off as 'thoughtful, meaningful cinema' these days.<br /><br />Think of this as "religious-institution art-house flick for Dummies" and youre spot-on.<br /><br />Two Stars.</p></body></html>

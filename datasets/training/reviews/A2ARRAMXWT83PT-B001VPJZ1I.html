<meta name="summary" content="Ron Howard's greatest acheivement!"></head><body><p>I was totally and utterly moved by this film! The performances were great, and the direction was perfect! Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly deserve the Oscars that they were nominated for. Great movie about a man's struggle with schizophrenia, and how he dealt with it. It's hard to believe that this actually happened. I was shocked. Twists and turns galore! <p>You'll love this film! Ron Howard also deserves an Oscar!</p></body></html>

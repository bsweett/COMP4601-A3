<meta name="summary" content="Breakdown Massacre"></head><body><p>This is a nice add to the lost in a horrible horror genre. It almost is like a cross between "Breakdown" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". A group of young men and women are stranded in the hills of West Virginia when they wreck their cars on a barely passable side road. Out comes the locals that look inbred enough to scare even their mother. Most people either love or hate these movies. Personally I find them entertaining if they don't overdue the gorefest and if there is a decent enough original story. Even though parts of it seem familiar, it is different enough to get credit for some originality and I'm glad to say the gore is outdone by the suspense. If you enjoy this be sure to catch the classics "Deliverance" and "Southern Comfort".</p></body></html>

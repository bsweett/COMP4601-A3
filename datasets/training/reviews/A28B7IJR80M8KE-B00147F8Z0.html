<meta name="summary" content="SCI-FI fans need to quit writing these films!!!!!!"></head><body><p>Is it just me, or do SCI-FI fans take these & "Star Wars" to seriously, first of all to all you haters>>> "you don't own these films", why all the hate?, I read the reviews & finally watched AVPR for myself, & although the characters were somewhat one-dimesional, it didn't kill it for me, what I liked about this aside from the fact that it picks up where AVP left off, is the fact that a lone Predator comes to earth to wipe out some aliens, when the hybrid alien/predator crashes the ship seen at the end of AVP in a small Colorado town the face huggers get loose & start their infestation on the locals, a distress signal is sent to the Predator homeworld, & a lone Predator is dispatched to earth to clean up the mess, this Predator is very much like the one in the first "Predator" film with a take-no-prisoners approach & this dude can rock-&-roll, he is the coolest Predator yet & boy, does he kick the aliens a**, this is a simple film that held my attention, I don't know what these 1 star people were expecting, but for me this one was cool, some complain about the nursery scene, there is nothing to suggest the hybrid killed the infants, as far as we know they were nuked along with the rest of the town by the government, & once again we see further proof as to why the "Company" was so obsessed with capturing it in the "Alien" films, this subplot was really hinted at in this one, all in all this one was not a disappointment to me, although I wished the pretty blond had lived, I was not disappointed, the "Predators are some of the coolest characters to come out of Hollywood, & this Predator was cool, just as his kind were in the other films, & the Aliens are just as menacing & nasty here as they always are, & the DVD was not dark, movies do look better once they go from the big screen to DVD!</p></body></html>

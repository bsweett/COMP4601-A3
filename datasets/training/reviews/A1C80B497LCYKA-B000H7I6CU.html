Once again, Pixar has come up with a story that is both engaging and meaningful, whose characters are endearing with effects that take animation one more level up. I actually fell in love with the little red racecar named Lightning McQueen. Now, I know guys are supposed to love cars - but this is ridiculous.<br /><br />Lightning is in love with himself. He thinks he doesn't need anyone else, even a pit crew. As the fastest rookie on the circuit, he thinks he's got everything he needs. He three-way ties for first place in the Piston Cup race and has to do a race off in California with the two other fastest cars: ego maniac Chick Hicks and good ol' boy The King. But on the way, he gets lost in the Arizona desert and ends up in a little forgotten town on legendary Route 66 called Radiator Springs, where he tears up the pavement on the town's main street and has to serve time repairing it. In the course of events, a little tow truck named Mater befriends him, as do most of the rest of the town, and he discovers there's been something missing from his life that he kind of likes: friends. He's been in such a hurry to be the fastest car on the track that he hasn't taken the time to enjoy, or realize how much he needs, other people - er, cars.<br /><br />It's a great story, and masterfully directed by John Lasseter (Toy Story I & II, A Bug's Life). Owen Wilson's voice is perfect for Lightning, as is Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. The writing is superb, and the animation - whew! The Nascar experience is perfectly reproduced with everyone participating as a vehicle - including the audience and announcers. There are even some actual racecar drivers playing themselves as cars, like Darrell Waltrip and Mario Andretti.<br /><br />The Route 66 experience is equally compelling, and actually the best part of the film, in my opinion. The underlying message is that there is something missing in our fast paced lives that if we would just slow down we might recapture. Thus, the metaphor between the race track (as well as the Interstate) and Route 66, which used to be a very scenic, well driven road that represented a more gracious time in our history - a time when friends and family were more important than getting ahead and winning the rat race.<br /><br />It's a great movie and a great DVD - a little slim on the extra features, but still well worth the money. I hope you fall in love with Lightning McQueen as I did.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></body></html>

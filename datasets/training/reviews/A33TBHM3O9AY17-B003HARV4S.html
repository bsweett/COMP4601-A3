<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating tale.  Giamatti is very good.  Norton is excellent!"></head><body><p>I saw this over the weekend and was pleasantly surprised.  Going in, I was expecting mainly a chick-flick (since my wife recommended it, and that's her main taste), and although this had a strong romantic theme it was anything but a chick-flick.  It's full of mystery, political intrigue, and plenty of suspense as well -- overall a very well balanced film.<br /><br />The feel and flavor of late-nineteenth century Vienna were very well done, particularly in the use of lighting and color (or rather, disuse of both elements -- lots of dark, drab scenes).  I thought Paul Giamatti was well cast as Chief Inspector Uhl, a man caught between his own ambitions and integrity.  I recently saw him as well in "Lady in the Water", and this newer role demonstrates his versatility as an actor.  Even better, I thought Ed Norton was excellent as Eisenheim, and got great support from Jessica Biel.  In my humble opinion only Rufus Sewell as crown prince Leopold was a little overdone, leaning disturbingly toward melodrama, but the other actors compensated nicely.<br /><br />As to the story itself, it has just enough of a blend of fairy tale, fantasy, realism and plausibility to appeal to a wide range of viewers.  The end offers a surprising twist that some may suspect but few fully understand or appreciate -- if they're honest about it.  Regardless of whether you can explain every detail, I think most of us will find this to be a very entertaining and enjoyable tale.</p></body></html>

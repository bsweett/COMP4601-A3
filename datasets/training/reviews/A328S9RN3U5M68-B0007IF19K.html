<meta name="summary" content="But a big hand for the ladies, too!"></head><body><p>RAY is one of the more media-hyped movies of the year with Oscar predictions all over the ads.  It is always with some misgivings that these movies are visited, admittedly with some resentment that they are pre-judged before a personal opinion can be made.  Such is the case for Jamie Foxx's performance as Ray Charles.  Not that his performance isn't excellent in this movie: the media would have us believe it is the first time this gifted actor has demonstrated his mettle, and that only means that too many folks have forgotten Foxx's powerful performances in such films as COLLATERAL earlier this year.<br /><br />RAY is a Hollywood-style biography and for this reviewer that hampers the story.  Too much attention is paid to the mannerisms of Ray Charles and Jamie Foxx just isn't given enough screen time away from his band and his audience to let us understand why he is an American icon:  it would have been so much richer had we been given insights as to Ray Charles' innovative impact on popular music - the origins, the attempts, the failures, and the successes and why.  Still in all Foxx is in fine form lip-synching Charles' terrific music, writhing in withdrawal from his heroin addiction, and especially showing us the personal tragedy when he hears the news of his lover's death with his wife observing the crushing blow.<br /><br />Which leads to what is the most sensitive aspect of this movie: the women.  Sharon Warren as Ray's poverty-surviving mother is radiant and gives a performance that is overwhelmingly beautiful.  Likewise, Kerry Washington as Bea, Ray's long-suffering yet enduring wife shows us one of the finer supporting roles of the year to date.  And that leaves Regina King as Ray's lover Margie, another of the strong female supporting roles in the film.<br /><br />But by far the 'star' of the film is the music of Ray Charles that is played intact and is simply wonderful on every level.  If all the rest of the film existed merely as background for these great moments in music, that would be sufficient.  With a bit more judicious editing by Director Taylor Hackford this could have been an even better film.  Grady Harp, October 2004</p></body></html>

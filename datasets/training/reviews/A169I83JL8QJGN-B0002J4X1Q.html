<meta name="summary" content="Yet another mess of a video game movie"></head><body><p>What might have been: Opening scene a helicopter flies over the forrest on the north western side of Raccon City, STARS Bravo team, lead by Albert Wesker are are investigating the disapearance of the Alpha team, when they land they are attacked by zombie dogs and chased into a mansion where they uncover the house is full of zombies and all kinds of different monsters. The original game (currently being remade for Nintendo GameCube) had the perfect premise for a scary movie, it had the atmosphere, the monsters, the suprises and everything that kept a person on thier toes, all things which the movie that was made a s a prequel did not have. WHat did this movie have that was good? Michelle Rodrigiez is very good looking... aside from that... There were some great makeup effects, but the one non-zombie monster that appeared was the licker, which looked terribly CGI. Over all the special effects were unimpressive, they held back way to much with the gore, and there was far more eye roller moments than scares. This is what we call a hack fest flick, except there wasn't a lot of hacking... so there wasn't a lot going on here that would make it a good horror flick. The problem with a lot of game based movies is that the movies don't follow the games closely enough, that's why only Mortal Kombat has succedded to be a good movie so far, but Mortal Kombat Annihilation strayed too far from the original plot of MK 2 and failed miserably because of it. The same can be said of all of the other game based movies. Many of them have been moderate successes, but we gamers go to see these hoping for a movie that will be true to the games, not be related by name only. Resident Evil Rebirth for GameCube will be time much better spent than watching this movie. The movie has a lot of guns, and a lot of zombies grabbing at people, and neither are enough to call it a Resident Evil movie.</p></body></html>

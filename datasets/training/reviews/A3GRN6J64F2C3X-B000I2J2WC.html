To me, Dan Brown's tale is just meant to be a thinking person's roller coaster ride, and a kind of thoughtful "what if...?"  The author wasn't purporting to write non-fiction, just a great campfire tale that takes many age-old theories, rumors and (to many) beliefs and run with them to great effect.<br /><br />With all its intentionally shocking ideas, I enjoyed the playful subversion of the book, so I was initially a little diappointed that the movie version pulls back from these ideas a little, primarily by making the Robert Langdon character more of a skeptic and defender of the status quo than he was in the book.  But, in the end, this worked out, as skeptics get to enjoy the movie a little more because their own positions are represented in the film, and- when the subversive stuff eventually does hit- it has more of an impact.<br /><br />Some critics also derided the film simply on the basis of its acting, pacing, etc.  But, I don't know... with all its mysteries, clues, chases, confrontations, and revelations, I think the movie is plenty entertaining, exciting and suspenseful.  Even seeing it again on DVD after catching it in theaters, the two hours-plus flew by.<br /><br />The second disc, containing generous bonus features, is good fun, too.  It was especially interesting to hear Dan Brown talk extensively about the whole phenomenon of the book and the choices that were made in adapting it to film.</p></body></html>

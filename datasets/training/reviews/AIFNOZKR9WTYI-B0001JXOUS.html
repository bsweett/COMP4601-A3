The movie takes itself so seriously that the viewer is dispensed of the obligation. As for the subject matter, the thing comes off as a Gilbert and Sullivan opera gone wrong. A comic opera with no comedy. A set of characters move around in front of lavishly colored back-drops, say things to one another, asiatics murmur inscrutably and doll-like women tip-toe around like Fred Flintstone at a bowling alley. The only thing missing is the &quot;plinlinglinglingling&quot; sound of high piano keys to accompany their movements. What's that? You say I am being unfair? Again, I am not saying this is a bad film, it is just an humorless and a pointless one. It is not a dramatization of historical events, so... what could possibly be the point? It might as well depict some kind of Boxer Rebellion that takes place on the moon, wherin Buzz Aldrin, after being kidnapped by lunar monks, decides to throw in with them as they storm Apollo 11. The climactic scene is where he stabs Neil Armstrong through the space suit with a pair of geologists tongs and tries to burn the American flag in the the nonexistent lunar atmosphere. Who can care about a scenario like this?</p></body></html>

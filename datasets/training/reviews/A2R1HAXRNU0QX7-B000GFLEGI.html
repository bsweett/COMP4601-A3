<meta name="summary" content="Great to revisit Romero's world"></head><body><p>First of all, let me say that it's pretty much essential to have seen the other Romero movies leading up to this one (NIGHT, DAWN and DAY OF THE DEAD).  Not because they are so plot heavy that you get lost if you skip one, but because there are two "progressions" you need to follow to fully enjoy these movies.<br /><br />First, we see the actual progression of low budget film making.  Unlike "indie" films, where directors make small movies with small stakes with small budgets, the "DEAD" movies are large scale movies made on a small budget...hence, low budget.  An "indie" film usually has enough money.  A low-budget film requires the filmmaker to accomplish something big on a shoestring, requiring a different type of problem solving.  The first film was black and white and contained its themes within a small house.  DAWN was contained mostly in a mall, but we got glimpses of the outside world and the growing catastrophe.  DAY was confined to a bunker, but again the global scale was growing.  And now the new film in state-of-the-art stock with CGI backgrounds takes the low-budget to the next level.  You are actually seldom aware the budget is low.<br /><br />And you get to follow the track of Romero's particular vision.  There's a million ways the same basic scenario could play out.  The dead are coming back to life and feeding on the living.  If they bite you...you will soon be a zombie.  Only way to kill you is to shoot or severely damage your head.  That's it.  How that idea would unspool for humanity is the fun of all this.  Romero brings to LAND OF THE DEAD a unique vision of the evolution of this scenario.  A lot of time has passed since NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and the surviving humans have developed some pretty sophisticated survival techniques.  That's fun to watch.<br /><br />But the zombies who remain have changed a bit themselves.  Their urges are the same...but now they actually have some semblance of organization.<br /><br />It's fun to watch these two sides cope with the changes from the others.  For the zombies, they can't get at the humans with much ease anymore, and thus need to reinvent themselves.  For the humans, who now live in an insulated society (dominated by a crazy Dennis Hopper...ain't that perfect!), they must cope with the warring factions developing between themselves...a conflict which threatens to allow the zombies the room they need to reemerge from obscurity.<br /><br />Some have said the movie is too slow or too hokey.  Or that the dialogue is bad.  Have you watched the other movies that you revere so much???  They have pretty bad dialogue too.  DAWN OF THE DEAD is 2 hours and 15 minutes, and many of the scenes of "mall life" drag on needlessly.  DAY OF THE DEAD is horrifically acted.  Yet we all love those.  And they are good, because the dialogue isn't really what we watch for.  It's the fascination with this primal conflict...and frankly, it's the gore.<br /><br />LAND OF THE DEAD doesn't have the huge amounts of gore that DAY OF THE DEAD had, but there are some "clever" moments of gore, and naturally it's far more realistic when we see it.  And it also has a few actors who can act.  Simon Baker is a credible "hero" in my opinion, John Leguizamo always has a bit of charisma, even when he's sorta slumming, Dennis Hopper never fails to bring a smile to my face...cuz when he overacts, it's SO fun.  And even Asia Argento brings a nice feel to her cliched role.  It's time for her to have an actual "role."<br /><br />Anyway,  I enjoyed the movie.  It's not a "classic" like the first two, and no, it doesn't have the outstanding flair of the recent DAWN remake (a movie I highly recommend), but it does offer familiar pleasures for fans of the genre.<br /><br />Despite all the nay-saying, I still say "yes."</p></body></html>

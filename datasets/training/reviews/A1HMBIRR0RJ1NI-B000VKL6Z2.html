Here we get to see the making of a serial killing psychopath machine! Outwardly, Michael is unemotional pure unadulterated evil. Inside, a smoldering anger of a young child left to ferment in his hatred of all those who surround him, & mostly, his hatred of himself.<br /><br />A terrifying portrait of what can be wrought on to others by a person whose years of systematic abuse by his family, & by those who ostracize him from society, filled with malicious school bullies, to a psychologist exploiting him for personal monetary gain & fame. This is Michael Myers life, not a life as most know it, but an existence blindly feeding off of hate & self loathing.</p></body></html>

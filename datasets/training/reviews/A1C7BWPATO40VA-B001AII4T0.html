You'll continuously refer to these questions listed below:<br /><br />1. What's happening?<br />2. Who's that?<br />3. Where's this at?<br /><br />and near the end..<br /><br />4. What's in the friggin box?<br />5. What the..... ?<br /><br />Everything is very anticlimactic, uninspired, and the story was unorganized and senseless in a lot of areas.<br /><br />Good action, good camera angles, just horrible chops in the movie.<br /><br />Whoever says this is a well made thriller or a good suspenseful film, I really don't know what to say to you. To each their own.<br /><br />By the way, NEVER....EVER....believe in a movie trailer again!</p></body></html>

I know I'm going to get clobbered for this review but......<br />It's not like I have anything against THE BUCKET LIST premise but really, what is so exciting about these characters jumping out of a plane, racing cars and being digitally imposed into the world's most famous landmarks ? Obviously Nicholson and Freeman have great chemistry but it's not like this movie is a lot more exciting than showing them playing cards or something. I love Freeman's narrations but: a) I don't think the Nicholson character earns his and b) enough is enough of them.<br />On my personal bucket list, missing this DVD will be item #1.</p></body></html>

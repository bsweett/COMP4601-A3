<meta name="summary" content="finally a remaster!"></head><body><p>Braveheart is 12 years old and the standard DVD is what 10,11 years old I didn't think Paramount would ever release a new Braveheart.No its not a director's cut and no its not on Blu-ray or HD-DVD but this new remasterd version has one great picture gone is the picture grain and the colors are way more vivid.So we are left with one of the best epic's of all time with one great picture and a second disc with some new extras including original cast interviews,making of braveheart,2 trailers,Tales of William Wallace,a photo montage and something called Alba gu Brath! I dont know what that last one is I havnt watched it.</p></body></html>

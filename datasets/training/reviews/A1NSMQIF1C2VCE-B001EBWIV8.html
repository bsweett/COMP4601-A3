<meta name="summary" content="Not the worst movie ever, but nothing approaching the first"></head><body><p>Few things can kill a movie series like success.<p>Just as George Lucas' &quot;Star Wars&quot; films have gotten increasingly unwatchable, the sequel to &quot;The Matrix&quot; already shows that success, money and hype have successfully insulated the Brothers Wachowski from criticism or even the ability for someone around them to question &quot;why is this action sequence so long,&quot; &quot;why is there a Mad Max rave scene with Morpheus totally acting out of character,&quot; &quot;what is the point of the whole sequence with the Merovingian,&quot; or, most importantly, &quot;why would you go two hours of nothing but action and then dump all this philosophy and obscure information on audiences in the final 10 minutes?&quot;<p>It's especially frustrating because &quot;The Matrix&quot; had built up so much good will towards it that the brothers didn't need to pander to their audiences -- being just as smart as the first film wouldn't have been rejected by the audience, but instead, we get a vastly dumbed-down film that fails to wow, and certainly fails to elicit any enthusiasm for the third installment in the series.<p>There are worse films out there, but few that have so squandered their potential along the way.<p>Recommended only for the most diehard &quot;Matrix&quot; fans.</p></body></html>

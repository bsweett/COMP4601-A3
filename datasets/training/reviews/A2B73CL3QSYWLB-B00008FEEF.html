Back when I was an impressionable undiscrimanating seventeen year old the body count was good enough for me.  It was also pretty cool watching it with an urban audience who shouted at the screen imploring in vain for the victims not to open door or closet.  Now it's no better or worse than any knockoff of the classic original "Halloween".  Events take place on the same evening as the original but it's more preposterous.  They open things up by having the action set mainly at a hospital but that makes it more ludicrous.  This has to be the darkest most sparcely staffed hospital I've ever seen.  Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis reprise their roles from the original but that only adds so much cred.  Proceed if you must but be prepared to be disappointed</p></body></html>

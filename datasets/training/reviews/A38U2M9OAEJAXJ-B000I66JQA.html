One Book."></head><body><p>Stephen Daldry's admirable "Billy Elliot" couldn't even begin to hint at the strokes of brilliance that make up his followup, "The Hours."  Based on the award-winning Michael Cunningham novel of the same name, "The Hours" tells the story of three women whose lives are numbed to all feeling and are desperate to escape the private hell that enslaves each of them.  The story travels within four decades and jumps back and forth from the United States to England.  Nicole Kidman is author Virgina Woolf, who is battling depression while living in the suburbs of London with her overprotective husband in the 1920s.  Julianne Moore plays a 1950s Los Angeles housewife, apparently stifled by her marriage while coming to terms with her sexuality.  Merryl Streep is living in present-day Manhattan and is preparing a party for her longtime friend and AIDS-stricken poet (Ed Harris).  To explain how these three stories are connected would give away potential spoilers (if you haven't already read the book), but the film's performances are nothing short of excellent.  Kidman digs deep into the angst and despair of Woolf; her performance is a blazing revelation, and it excels by a nose (pardon the pun).  Moore's scenes with her young son are crushing and heartbreaking; you don't know whether to pity her or resent her for her selfishness.  And Streep, is, as ever, a powerhouse.  But the real star of the movie is director Daldry, who extracts great performances, and does a wonderful job at bringing the screenplay to life.  "The Hours" is hardly a feel-good movie, and the recurring themes of suicide and despair may put off some. But it's no doubt one of the best films of 2002.</p></body></html>

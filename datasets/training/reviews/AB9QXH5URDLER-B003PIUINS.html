<meta name="summary" content="Lots of Gore"></head><body><p>People don't watch films like this for the plot or acting.  Good thing.  The plot is tired and the characters only exist to become death fodder.<br /><br />People watch films like this because they think its cool watching new, novel ways to mutilate two-dimensional characters.  If that is what the viewer wants, that is what the viewer gets.  From the first scenes to the last, characters are cut, slashed, burned, squashed, and otherwise wiped out.  The director does a better than average job of filming the gore.  Even though I don't like this type of film, I have to admit I was impressed with the creativity.  I didn't know there were so many ways to film accidents.  I never suspected that an exploding barbecue grill could do so much damage.  In this particular cut and slash film the director gets to kill off the characters more than once.  Now that's a lot of bang for the buck!<br /><br />I have only two suggestions.  If you are watching the film with a group of friends, get some sodas and pop corn.  If you are watching the film alone, don't waste your time going through it in the usual, slow way.  It is quit easy to predict when the cool stuff is about to happen.  Keep a finger on the remote control and zoom through the film, only slowing down for the really neat stuff.  Then you can back up to slow motion and watch it all again.  This way you can see every body get killed four times and get it done in about an hour!</p></body></html>

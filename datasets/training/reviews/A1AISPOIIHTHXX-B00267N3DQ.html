<meta name="summary" content="The very first animated feature is worth your time"></head><body><p>Nobody did animated features back in the 20's and 30's. The only one doing animation was some small companies and Disney, who were mainly making shorts. Walt had the idea of creating a full length feature. And while I do have some issues with the film, it's definately worth your time.<br /><br />The Queen is a very vain woman who can't stand anyone being more beautiful than her. There is one rival though: Snow White. The Queen sends a hunter to kill her but he spares her life and she runs off. She ends up finding an old empty cottage and cleans it and passes out. Meanwhile, 7 dwarves with distinctive personalities come home and find their house clean. Eventually, they become a big family and have fun but the Queen finds out she lives and so she poisons an apple that puts all who take a bite into a coma. The dwarves have to come and save the day.<br /><br />It's a great film full of memorable images, characters and music. However I thought it felt kinda long. When the dwarves come home, they took quite awhile before they actually find Snow White. I guess it's kind of the rookie feeling I have with the film. Disney hadn't really mastered having a long running time yet which they would greatly improve on. There is a wealth of extras also and they did a superb job restoring the film has there was a bit of color fading and scratches in the print.<br /><br />If you're at all into disney, I would definately suggest picking this up.</p></body></html>

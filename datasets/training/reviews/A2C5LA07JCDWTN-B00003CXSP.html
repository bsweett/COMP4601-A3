<meta name="summary" content="This is one SICK FILM!"></head><body><p>Hannibal is such a breath of fresh air in today's hollywood landscape. It is a film that is unapologetic and unflinching in its depiction of graphic violence. Most of today's so called &quot;horror&quot; films have been reduced to nothing more than cheap laughs and tight halter tops. Hannibal is the antithesis of the so-called &quot;modern&quot; horror film. Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal Lechter to scary perfection. He is a refined, well educated, verbose, psychopath. Those who are suspect of the film because of the absence of Jodie Foster should read the title of the film, Hannibal. The great majority of Hannibal focuses on the title character and not Federal Agent Starling. Julianne Moore is servicable but is really a periphery character. Once again Ridley Scott has proven that he is one of the few remaining master directors in Hollywood and he continues to produce important and intriguing work. Overall, this is without a doubt a DVD that you should own not only for the film but for the extras including an alternate ending and deleted scenes. One word of caution: This film should NOT be viewed by children (especially the last 20 minutes). That said, enjoy and prepare to be shocked.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A bloody celebration of tribal warfare"></head><body><p>GANGS OF NEW YORK, directed by Martin Scorsese, is perhaps a caricature of the time and place it ostensibly portrays.<p>The film begins in 1846 when "Priest" Vallon (Liam Neeson) leads poor, Irish, immigrant brawlers from the most wretched of New York City's slums into the street confluence known as Five Points to confront a mob of native-born, New York thugs led by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis). In the resulting spasm of jingoistic violence, Bill kills Vallon while the latter's young son looks on, and the immigrants are soundly defeated. In the blink of a cinematic eye, the young Vallon then spends 16 years in a city orphanage before emerging in 1863 to take the name of "Amsterdam". At this point in history, the U.S. is convulsed by the Civil War, the Irish are still the main immigrant group flooding into NYC, and the Butcher remains the strongman leading the virulently nationalistic (i.e., anti-Catholic and anti-Irish) confederation of urban gangs. Now played by Leonardo DiCaprio, Amsterdam insinuates himself into Bill's service hoping for the opportunity to avenge the death of his father. <p>DiCaprio is presumably the lead in this visually arresting period piece, but his stiff performance is completely upstaged by Day-Lewis playing the vicious, charismatic, curiously rakish Bill the Butcher, who kills his victims with knives and cleavers. Daniel is the best - and perhaps only - reason to see GANGS OF NEW YORK. Cameron Diaz adds little as Jenny, Bill's moll who catches Amsterdam's eye.<p>For me, the most interesting aspect of the movie was the insertion into the plot of the New York City Draft Riot, those 3 days in July 1863 when perhaps 50,000 rioters, mostly Irish, protested Abraham Lincoln's conscription of men into the Union Army by burning and looting buildings, and attacking and killing Black residents. Perhaps 100 citizens died (although the film implies a more extensive massacre). Units of the army, fresh from their victory at Gettysburg, had to be brought in to quell the violence. By the film's conclusion, the confrontation between the Irish gangs and those led by the Butcher is submerged in the larger conflict. Indeed, were I to try and hypothesize the point of this epic, it would be that the tantrums of the federal government render inconsequential the squabbles of lesser mortals. Beyond that, GANGS OF NEW YORK seemed totally pointless except as a lengthy exercise in period costuming and blood-drenched violence.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Top-notch special effects elevate hyper-convoluted tale"></head><body><p>"The Matrix" burst on the scene with mind-boggling special effects and a witty reality-versus-perception theme that justified those amazing special effects.  A top-notch cast worked with a script that had just enough spirituality associated wtih it that viewers didn't consider "The Matrix" just another dumb action movie.  At the end, the possibilities of "The Matrix" seemed limitless -- and the conjectures regarding where this storyline could lead were almost as entertaining as the movie itself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the sequels bogged down, both in the attempt to top the action scenes of the original, and by the simple truth that by advancing the storyline, the sequels eliminated our ability to speculate where "The Matrix" was headed.  Just like "The Blair Witch Project" was so scary because we didn't really know or see what was going on, the possibilities of Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity battling against Agent Smith and the machines were more exciting in their unknown state than they could ever be in an actual story.<br /><br />The creative forces behind "The Matrix" cannot be accused of failing to delve deeper into the storyline.  By the time "The Matrix Revolutions" came around, we had gone so far beyond the first movie as to make it almost unrecognizable.  Indeed, I had a hard time even figuring out who the villains of "Revolutions" are -- is Neo most concerned about the machines, or the Merovingian, or the Trainman, or the assassin going after him in Zion . . . and what the hell is Agent Smith doing anyway?  And what about the Architect?  Just who is the Oracle, anyway?<br /><br />I'm sure there are those who have explored every website, fan fiction storyline, and utterance of those who created the Matrix mythology who understand this complicated storyline.  But I merely watched the movies, and I really couldn't make heads or tails of the story after a while.<br /><br />Fortunately, "The Matrix Revolutions" is one of the most enjoyable movies to watch I have ever seen (based on purely visual terms).  The machines eventually breach the human stronghold of Zion, and what unfolds is a battle of machine versus man (who, to be fair, uses machines) that astounds the eye and also strikes a few notes of pathos.  We see sacrifice and heroism in the face of overwhelming odds, and while we may not entirely understand what that sacrifice is for in precise terms, it is clear that these people are sacrificing their own lives for the greater humanity.  And that is enough.<br /><br />After the climax of this battle, Neo and Agent Smith have their much-ballyhooed mano-y-machino fisticuffs.  Please don't ask me to explain why this is the climactic fight, or even who really wins, but the visuals are undeniably amazing.<br /><br />The movie ends on an optimistic yet ambiguous note . . . will the War between man and machine continue?  Well, the problem is that since we're dealing with a storyline about futuristic computers and perception-versus-reality, there is nothing stopping the creators of "The Matrix" to spit out innumerable sequels that continually reexamine the same illogical themes.<br /><br />Well, the only speedbump is probably movie studio finances.  It's a troubling trilogy that concludes with a sense of, "We'll be right back here, provided the accountants can do a favorable cost-benefit analysis."<br /><br />"The Matrix Revolutions" ultimately goes out with a whimper rather than a bang . . . a spectacular, dizzying whimper, to be sure, but a whimper nevertheless.</p></body></html>

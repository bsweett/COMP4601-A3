As an American reporter says: "People will watch this massacre and murder and say, what a shame, and turn back to their dinner."<br />And that is exactly what happened.<br />"Hotel Rwanda" is shot in flat, almost non-dimensional color that detracts from the inherent drama of this story. Think about the hand held camerawork and use of color in Oliver Stone's "Salvador." "HR" is the opposite of that groundbreaking film in execution.<br />But, and this is a big BUT: there is the courageous performance of Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, a Hotel manager who becomes the savior, through cagey-thinking, horse-sense really, to thousands of Rwandans. Cheadle's Paul is frightened yet calm: his expressive eyes and face always thinking, pondering about what to do next to save his family, friends and whomever else he can: through whatever means he can.<br />"Hotel Rwanda" is not a great movie but it is an important one for it tells a story that everyone everywhere needs to know, understand and digest. Why did all of the major powers turn their heads when it was happening? Why did We allow this to happen?</p></body></html>

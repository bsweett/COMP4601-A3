<meta name="summary" content="Shallow and Predictable Jingoistic Fluff"></head><body><p>An utterly frivolous film that has more bad lines than good special effects.  A completely predictable plot of an alien invasion where the good old U.S. Cavalry saves the day:  Uaaaah!  I'm yawning of boredom just thinking about this film!<br /><br />More time seems to have been spent on these cheap patriotic one-liners than anything else. Even the special effects weren't that great.  Repetitive scenes of U.S. fighter jets flying in a straight line occasionally shooting some missiles: wow! how creative!  Lucas did a better job in Star Wars with plastic models over 20 years before and these guys can't do better with CGI? The aliens don't fool anyone as one can clearly see that they're humans who dressed up in costumes pulled out of a 1950's sci-fi movie prop storage.<br /><br />As for the plot: horrible! Hot shot pilot learns how to fly alien space craft in a jiff. Fighter jets and conventional missiles can outspeed and outmaneuver alien craft that obviously have the technology of traveling much faster.  Will Smith finds his wife, child, and dog after the entire city of L.A. has been incinerated: yeepie!  All it takes to bring down the aliens is to infect their unknown technology with a conventional computer virus (who came up with these stupid scenarios anyway?!  A five-year old can conjure better stories than this!)<br /><br />In short, this film is essentially as patriotic and shallow as a Rambo sequel. If you like this genre then you'll probaly like this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Worst Film that I have seen in about 5 Years!"></head><body><p>This movie was about as painful to watch as the revenge exacted by the brothers in this movie on the killers of their "mother."<br /><br />An old woman is gunned down during a robbery and it turns out she was a type of social worker that had taken in four troubled youths and raised them as her sons.  The sons vow to find and kill the ones who did this.  They later find out that it was not a simple robbery but that that their mother was followed and executed.<br /><br />The movie is full of senseless violence and makes Detroit look like a state of anarchy.  Sofia Vergara has a stereotypical role as a dumb Latin lover of one of the four brother which looks like a role that will be a career killer for her.<br /><br />The ending is fairly predictable and the movie's plot and stupid dialogue often is an insult to anyone's intelligence.  Maybe Mark Wohlers should abandon his acting career and go back to rapping!</p></body></html>

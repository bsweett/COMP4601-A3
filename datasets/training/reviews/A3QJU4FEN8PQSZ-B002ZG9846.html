<meta name="summary" content="Fun, but not for kids, but not that violent, but ..."></head><body><p>Most reviews in the press warned about some kind of ultraviolent, slice-and-dice flick. I was worried. But it's nowhere near as violent as, say, Kill Bill. Not many limbs getting hacked off. Nothing particularly disturbing, although there's implied violence such as a finger getting cut off. It's par for the course for any shoot-em-up these days. No bones breaking and poking through. So what's the real reason for their discomfort?<br /><br />Well, you do have a 10 or 11-year old girl mouthing obscenities. It is a little disturbing, but it's not plentiful, and it is within character - she's been trained by her ex-policeman Big Daddy. So yes, I wouldn't let kids watch this. She does plant blades and bullets into many baddies, but from the reviews I had expected her to routinely slice them in half. There's nary a beheading.<br /><br />It's a tale of ordinary folk trying to be superheroes. One doesn't do so well because he has no super powers to speak of - well, none of them do; Hit Girl and her dad do OK because of rigorous training. Kick Ass gets his ass kicked, though not as brutally as I was led to believe. Well, it's still painful. And there's a bittersweet friendship story in there as well, between Kick-Ass and Red Mist, son of the big bad guy.<br /><br />Underneath all this is a movie with humor, heart and an uplifting shootout at the end.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Dead Silence" Does For Ventriloquist Dummies What Stephen King's "It" Did For Clowns"></head><body><p>The creators of the controversial blockbuster "Saw" have brought us a modern masterpiece of gothic horror.  In the tradition of "Darkness Falls" and "The Ring," another urban legend has been given the big screen treatment.  "Dead Silence" involves an elderly, childless ventriloquist named Mary Shaw who is accused of causing the disappearance of a boy from a wealthy family.  The townsmen cut out her tongue and murder her.  She is buried along with her massive collection of ventriloquist dummies.  Soon after, entire families are found murdered with their tongues ripped out.  Legend has it that if you see her ghost and scream, you will have your tongue ripped out.<br /><br />  Great performances, a creepy atmosphere of decay and desolation, and a good musical score make "Dead Silence" a must see for fans of gothic horror.  I promise that you will never be able to look again at a ventriloquist dummy without shivering.</p></body></html>

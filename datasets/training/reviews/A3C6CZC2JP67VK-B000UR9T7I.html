<meta name="summary" content="[3.5]--Not everything magically turns Out for the best in the end"></head><body><p>Firstly I have to say this movie was enjoyable to an certain extent but the rest of it ended up being a disappointment. The plot was so underdeveloped that it turn out to be ridiculous, Tobey Maguire's character has so many mood swings that I couldn't help but wish I saved my gas and ticket money. The villains were mediocre; the ones which should have had more time on screen didn't live up to their potential. We should have been warned when Raimi said in an interview that he was never a fan of Venom. Spiderman represents good, Venom is evil. It's a classic match up, yet Raimi decided to add 30 minutes of Peter Parker becoming emo, thrusting his hips, and a dance sequence. Why have an epic battle between good and evil when you shoot yourself in the foot and focus on hormones? I bet if I would have tried to come up with a way to ruin this movie, I wouldn't have come close to what Raimi accomplished.<br /><br />And two and a half hours?! They could've made probably 2 decent movies out of those 3 villains and made each one a normal length. Why they decided to fill in as many characters as possible and give them all a whopping 10 minutes of background is beyond me. These are comic book characters, they're hard to make believable in the first place. You really need to give a character like that some depth for an audience to not want to ridicule them. Sandman and the new goblin both admirable foes and both shown well, however venom could have been so much more and came across far too weak as far as I am concerned and seemed to be slipped on the back of an average film to try and boost ratings. I am not one for cliffhangers in large franchises, I mean the only reason I didn't see the 3rd matrix film was because the cliffhanger was pointless and the second film killed off any point of a third, however a full venom film would have made sense due to its sheer fantastic reasoning and design, even introducing the character carnage would have been fantastic, but he seems rushed in this film, and that not the way to win over die hard fans and new fans the like!<br /><br />This movie will continue to be seen by lots viewers so there's no point on recommending this. It does has some great action sequences and the Bruce Campbell cameo was fantastic, however do not watch this thinking you are going to get the same quality and attention to detail as the first two films, watch it like X-Men 3, as this is just what it is, a good trilogy spoilt by the lack of development and the need to force as many characters in at once.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="marital heartbreak and raising unruly kids and antics with real estate and  Clooney's funny jogging"></head><body><p>George Clooney's character, Matt King, is quick to point out that even living on an island paradise doesn't exempt one from exposure to the kinds of messed-up crap that inflict everyone else. Life in its essence is the same for the inhabitants of Hawaii. You just live it wearing colorful shirts, shorts, and sandals. THE DESCENDANTS certainly has its laugh-out-loud bits, but mostly it's a drama about loss and grief and acceptance and all that superfun stuff. And if I were to gauge this film's quality by how often I heard guffaws and sniffles in the theater I went to, then THE DESCENDANTS has earned some big bragging rights. And maybe an Oscar nod for Clooney, and maybe another one for a superb young actress, Shailene Woodley. Both of them anchor the film.<br /><br />Clooney inhabits his role with a thoughtfulness and an intelligence that not too many of his contemporaries could've matched, and every so often he's not afraid to play the fool (did you check out his goofy jogging?). Mostly, attorney Matt King is just trying to keep his head above water, as he juggles several pressing issues. As the sole trustee of the family's highly coveted ancestral land, there's pressure from his sprawling cast of greedy cousins to sell. Matt is also trying to keep his two troubled young daughters in check, never mind that he views himself as the back-up parent. Most painfully, his comatose wife, Elizabeth, had suffered a grave boating accident, and it's only a matter of time before the plug is pulled, in accordance to her living will. And if you've seen the trailer then you know that his foul-mouthed oldest daughter, Alexandra (Woodley), springs a huge shock on him. In one of her frequent raging tantrums, she informs him that his wife had been cheating on him. Because even paradise sees its share of rocky marriages.<br /><br />Clooney's restrained performance is compelling and I love his acting choices, the things that he does and how he expresses his dialogue (and there's plenty of dialogue). But I knew Clooney could act. Shailene Woodley is the revelation. Even more than Clooney, Woodley, angry and conflicted and forceful, provides the story's emotional impact. It's a splendid cast across the board, really, from Amara Miller (who plays Matt's ten-year-old daughter Scotty) to a surprisingly grown-up Matthew Lillard to Judy Greer who is absolutely fantastic as the wife of the man cheating with Elizabeth. Nick Krause steals several scenes as Alexandra's st0ner surfer boyfriend Sid. Sid accompanies the Kings as Matt, Alex, and Scotty go island-hopping in search of the elusive other man in Elizabeth's life. I guess it's one way to cope with the impending loss of a loved one. Sid starts out as this oblivious tool but later demonstrates unexpected levels of insight and loyalty. One of Matt King's voice-over observations is that in Hawaii "the most powerful men look like bums and stunt men." In a tiny but pivotal part, Beau Bridges plays one of Matt's laid back cousins, and it's worth it to see Bridges not missing a beat as he goes from affable to affably menacing.<br /><br />Hawaii provides a picturesque backdrop, and it's maybe jarring that we're watching this sad family affair unfolding on an idyllic island paradise. Or maybe that's the conflicting emotion director Alexander Payne was going for. A certain askewed perception. Grief looks a bit odd when the mourners are always dressed for a barbecue. Ultimately THE DESCENDANTS is frank and honest, and sometimes brutally honest. I like that it doesn't pander or try to be cute. The story runs the gamut of laughter and tears, and there's something rewarding in watching Matt and his kids pull together. Elizabeth, the dying wife and mother, is portrayed as a complicated real person, and not put on a pedestal, or not much, anyway. We become privy to her virtues but also to her faults, and the film suggests that Matt, too, is not without blame. And Payne doesn't shy away from exhibiting the degenerative physical toll exacted on a failing coma patient. Each of Matt's visits to the hospital documents Elizabeth's further wasting away. Which sort of wends back to Matt King's point early on. There's no escaping life; it comes with heavy baggages; and death even in paradise is the great leveler. But it's hard to console yourself with that. Me, I'd probably act out, like Matt's kids.</p></body></html>

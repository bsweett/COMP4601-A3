I must have seen this 30 times over years - a strong, well-paced script rips the audience through the basic setup quickly before sending us on exactly the ride that Quaid paid for at Recall.<br /><br />In a story that has really nothing to do with Philip K Dick's original, it does manage to pack in enough science fiction elements without collapsing under the weight of its own ludicrousness. The script leans heavily towards suggesting it was all a dream so almost anything far-fetched can be explained from this angle.<br /><br />In traditional Paul Verhoeven style, it offers a level of violence that makes most horror films look like children's TV, and in the DVD extras he gleefully  justifies it quite convincingly. The in-camera special effects are what really gives this film its unique look - the clever animatronics, well designed models and sets all combine to create a mutant-filled Mars that looks great on camera. Although I'm sure 2012's remake will all be CGI, it will lose some of its charm as a result.<br /><br />Total Recall also had a near-perfect cast. Sharon Stone shines as his double-agent wife, Rachael Ticotin is a great love interest, and Michael Ironside bellows his way through as the psychotic Richter. Even Ronny Cox is perfect playing pretty much the same character from Verhoeven's Robocop. It's a really a classic in so many respects.<br /><br />As an aside, it's interesting which technologies in this film have become a reality, from the 3D body scanners to the location tracking on a handheld device. Although I don't expect colonies on Mars anytime soon, Johnny Cab might well be the commercial incarnation of Google's self-driving car!</p></body></html>

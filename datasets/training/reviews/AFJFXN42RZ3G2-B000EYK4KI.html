The opening scene of the film bears similarities of an obvious plotline.  Little do we know that Brad Pitt (John Smith) and Angelina Jolie (Jane Smith) live a double life in their quaint suburban splendor-- two car garage and neighborhood parties  Behind the white picket fence, lives the gun toting couple who live on espionage and intrigue, and lies.<br /><br />The film is a cross between a James Bond film and an episode from Alias.  With its fast-paced action and semi-dark comedy tone, the film offers the crash and boom along with the laughs.  The laughable dialogue and movie soundtrack includes the eclectic sounds from Joe Strummer, which gives some of the scenes where Jolie and Pitt "duke it out" a quasi spaghetti western feel.<br /><br />Jolie and Pitt may not be in the same league as past Hollywood couples.  However, they attempt at providing sophistication and humor to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, which makes it a "good-looking" film with all its high gadgetry and high jinx.  It is one of those films to see for the fun of it.</p></body></html>

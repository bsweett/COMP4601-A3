<meta name="summary" content="George Clooney's *other* political movie of 2011"></head><body><p>People think of The Ides of March as George Clooney's big political film of last year, but this title actually it could be claimed for The Descendants, which is every bit as much about politics, family values, wielding power and the responsibilities of the "one percent," to the degree that I'm amazed Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck didn't denounce it with the usual vitriol they reserve for anything vaguely liberal. The story, based on a book I'm not familiar with, deals with the tension between wanting your rewards now now now and looking out for the future with some present-day self-sacrifice.<br /><br />The selfish side is best represented by the greedy cousins of Matt King, who's played by George Clooney, as well as his suspicious and proudly ignorant father-in-law. (I love the way we learn without his having to tell us that he is probably militantly right-wing: he still sports what looks like his GI haircut, talks in a very "ten-hut!" manner and his first words, looking at the living will, are "Might as well be in Korean," so we know which war he likely fought in, a war that seemed to leave him with at least some PTSD.) This one side of the matter sees issues in very black and white ways and jumps to conclusions, never really listening to the positions King spells out in great detail. King, meanwhile, is the hard-working but absentee father trying to reconnect with his two daughters after his wife is fatally injured in a boating accident. (And no, I didn't just give away a spoiler; even though we see Elizabeth King alive and happy in the first shot, we find out ten minutes later that she will never recover from her injuries and must be unplugged from life-support.) Meanwhile, Matt King is far from perfect: his marriage was a wreck long before the movie began, and his own selfish ways have resulted in children who do not respect him (or their mother) and are emotionally adrift.<br /><br />The older daughter is played in a stellar performance by newcomer Shailene Woodley, whom I would have loved to snag a best-supporting actress Oscar. If she continues to get good parts and doesn't wreck her career a la Lohan I think she could become very big. Her subtly-shifting acting as she gets to know and finally bonds with her dad is masterful, and the scenes with Clooney on the vacation as she's helping him track down the man who slept with his wife are the highlight of the film, at least from an acting point of view.<br /><br />But ultimately it's the screenplay that makes The Descendants extraordinary. I hate to be lazy and quote someone else, but Roger Ebert summed up exactly what struck me: "The film follows Matt's legal, family and emotional troubles in careful detail, until [director Alexander] Payne shows us, without forcing it, that they are all coiled together. A solution for one must be a solution for all. This is so much more complex than most movie plots, where good and evil are neatly compartmented and can be sorted out at the end." Amen. This is a nuanced and layered screenplay, something very rare these days. We see characters grow by their actions. Woodley's character initially despises her father, but after a scene in the car where her boyfriend Sid acts snide and immature, she offers to sit up front with him and from then on begins quietly supporting him. And though Sid is childish at the beginning, we learn it's largely a cover (as it is with so many teens) for scars he's borne on his own: later, at a very awkward moment, Sid has the maturity to take everyone in the room to the cafeteria so that Clooney can have some privacy with a jilted spouse. None of this is italicized; it happens very quietly. The one-star Amazon reviewer below me who says this is standard TV fare isn't seeing the forest from the trees while thinking he's being clever. Yes, this is the stuff TV melodramas deal with. No, they almost never deal with it this richly. That's the difference. All the difference in the world.<br /><br />But more interesting is the film's political message, which is oddly both subtle and obvious simultaneously. On the one side are the people who spent their trust money up front, satisfying instant gratifications, and are now broke because of it. They now want to sell the land to a developer who will build resorts or retail stores or whatever, while they sit home and count their newfound money, not caring about what this means for the future. ("Drill, baby, drill!") "When do I get to play here?" the youngest daughter, who's never enjoyed this family land, asks her dad at one point. On the other side is the Clooney character, who lives well, but who also works hard to do so, and understands that happiness is not entirely about money, embodying an outlook a certain political party preaches all the time but rarely practices. I find this sort of "political film" more effective than direct thrillers. This is the perfect vehicle for Clooney, who does a great job with it.<br /><br />The Descendants looks reasonably good, though a little soft, in this DVD transfer. Supplements consist of the theatrical trailer and three bizarre mini-docs. The first, titled "Everybody Loves George," is a fifteen minute love-fest about George Clooney. We learn from his co-actors that he's so funny and talented (he does impressions!) and generous, over and over, until we are ready to barf our pi&ntilde;a coladas. The second doc is even odder: a similar fan-boy treatment of director Alexander Payne, with praise about how brilliant he is. ("He really is an auteur," we're assured.) This video starts with Payne making omelets on location and I'm wondering for who, when at the end we realize it's for his wonderful cast! He cooks for them because they're family!, and the one he dishes out just as we fade to black is for Nick Krause, who plays Sid. I'm betting this is the only omelet Krause ever got from Payne. Really, I'm sure the director is a nice enough guy, but isn't the best proof of magnanimity keeping quiet about it?<br /><br />The third mini doc is the weirdest of all. It's about the location, the land of Hawaii and what the rituals of filming there were--saying prayers to the spirits at the beginning of the shoot and so on. There are a few interesting things to learn, such as the meaning behind the yellow blanket first seen on Elizabeth in the hospital and in the end shot with the rest of the family, but overall this video was too much, especially after the other two, and so I ejected the disc after a few minutes. I would have liked a making-of featurette, or a discussion of the story's intent with the author of the book (the author's thoughts are barely acknowledged, as usual), rather than watching the cast and crew kiss George Clooney's and Alexander Payne's behinds.<br /><br />So just skip the extras--there's better supplementary material and cast interviews on imdb and YouTube anyway. The Descendants itself is very good, a little slow in spots, with a few too many generic scenic pans and ukulele montages. But overall this is that rarity, a film with depth as well as many plot surprises. Definitely *not* a garden-variety TV movie-of-the-week.</p></body></html>

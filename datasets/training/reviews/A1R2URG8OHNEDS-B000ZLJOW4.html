<meta name="summary" content="One of the Greatest (Bleepin) Movies of All Time!"></head><body><p>I rented Ghost World because I never got to see it in the theatres.I never knew about it when it was in the theatres and one day just saw it at my local video store.One day I decided to just check it out and I was very very glad.The movie was filled with great things.The acting was great,the plot was great,the score was excellant,and just the combination of every thing put together.It all makes one great two hours of comendy and drama,and it just makes you think alot about things.Even though the movie is not a teen movie there are teens in it making it good for everybody who is a teen and above.The movie does have alot of profanity which makes it not for children but everybody eles is ok.The is definatly one of the greatest movies of all time.<p>The cast is consisted to about 5 main characters.Those main characters are Enid who is played by Thora Birch,Scarlett Johansson,Steve Buscemi,Brad Renfero,and Illiana Douglas.Steve Buscemi and Scarlett Johansson are two of my favorite actors and they shine on the screen in this movie while Thora Birch who I never saw in anything didn't have me to much.Even though she was very good in the movie I just never knew how to rate her.Illiana Douglas I only saw on an episode of Frasier where in the credits I aroused myself to one simple question.Who the heck is Brad Renfero?<p>The plot is focused around Enid(Thora Birch)and Rebbeca(Scarlett Johansson)who just graduated from hign school and are planning to skip collage and move in with each other.They are very different from other people and seem to always be in there own little world as they love to pester there friend Josh who works ay a grocery store called the Sidewinder where a trouble maker loves to hang out at and basecially cause trouble.One day they follow two Satanists and end up at a 50's theme diner.There they decide to call a man who wrote a ad in the personals asking about is some girl remembered him from a couple of days ago.They decide to call and pretend to be her and then they watch as he gets stood up by no one.Enid ends up befriending the man whose name is Seymour(Steve Buscemi)and one things leads after anthor and then by the end of the summer her whole life is turned upside down.<p>Ghost World was very different then what I thought it was going to be like.One of the greatest elements of the movie was it's score which blew me away.Ghost World is almost perfect in everyway and I am proud to own a copy of the DVD.<p>ENJOY!</p></body></html>

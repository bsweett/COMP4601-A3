<meta name="summary" content="Not bad, but not as good as I expected"></head><body><p>I have always been a huge Stephen King fan, and I'm happy to say that 1408 is not a bad adaptation by any means. The story does feel a little recycled from The Shining, but mainly because it deals with a hotel and the evil spirits that haunt it. The acting is pretty good, but some of the dialogue could have used some work.<br /><br />Worth your dollar on a rainy day.<br /><br />3 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

But while waiting for his wife's Christmas party to break up, terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take control of the building.  Their goal: $640 million in bearer bonds locked in the building's safe.  John manages to slip away unnoticed by the terrorists.  Armed with only a service weapon and his resiliance, John launches his own one-man war against the terrorists.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Gruber and the rest of his thugs have begun the laborious task of breaking into the building's safe.  Protected by seven different types of locks, it will be a tough nut for even the most experienced hacker to crack.  John has pulled a fire alarm in the hopes of attracting attention to the building, but Gruber manages to explain that its a false alarm and the fire trucks turn around before reaching the building.  However, John is able to obtain a walkie talkie radio, and he calls an emergency frequency to alert the police of the situation.  The dispatcher doesn't believe John, but then gunfire erupts in the background.  The dispatcher then sends a patrol car driven by officer Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) to the scene.  After walking through the building, he believes that nothing is wrong and begins to drive away.  Just then, John throws the body of one of the dead terrorists on the roof of Al's car.  Al immediately calls for back-up (after nearly destroying his car in the process).<br /><br />Soon, the LAPD and FBI are on the scene.  Al and John have maintained contact over their radios, and a deep bond has formed between the two.  John has continued his methodical elimination of the terrorists, but he's no closer to rescuing his wife.  Will John survive, or will Hans and his remaining thugs get away with the money?<br /><br />This is a first-class thriller from start to finish.  Bruce Willis is excellent as the undergunned but determined McClane, Alexander Godunov is perfect as Gruber's right-hand man Karl, and Reginald VelJohnson is great as Sgt. Powell.  The action and suspense continues throughout the film, and there's some funny one-liners from Willis along the way.  Two successful sequels followed this teriffic original film.<br /><br />I give this movie a very  high recommendation.  The action will definitely keep you interested throughout, and Willis' acting is the high point of the film.  Action movie fans will not want to miss this one.</p></body></html>

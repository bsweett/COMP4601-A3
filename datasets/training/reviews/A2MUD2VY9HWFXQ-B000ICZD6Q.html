These are the elements that make up "In Good Company"; a very bright film that explores coming of age on both sides of the fence.<br /><br />Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) is a 51 year old who has made a career by selling ad space for "Sports America". He has a well established team of employees beneath him and is very much respected by his peers.<br /><br />Sports America has been bought out by "Globecom", and with the "take over" comes some restructuring and some "cleaning out".<br /><br />Enter 26 year old Carter Duryea (Toper Grace), a Globecom employee given the opportunity of a lifetime to work at "Sports America"; cut their costs and increase their revenue.<br /><br />As Carter begins demoting and firing people, he leans to Dan for support because he is young and really has no idea what the hell he is going to do. Dan isn't impressed by the young Carter, and never fails to point out Carter's obvious flaws and lack of experience.<br /><br />Carter IS trying, he just has no direction. When his marriage fails and his wife bails out because she is apparently not getting any attention, Carter begins to get quite lonely; despite his financial success. He works his new team on weekends, and is pretty desperate for attention.<br /><br />Carter happens to weasel his way over to Dan's house one weekend evening for dinner, much to Dan's regret. During the visit, he gets a chance to talk with Dan's daughter Alex (Scarlett Johansson), who is about to start college at NYU. A future encounter on a city street starts a secret relationship ship between Carter and Alex.<br /><br />During this time, Carter is firing people left and right at the ordering of his Globecom superiors. Poor Dan is losing his whole team, not to mention his faith in his career. He puts up with Carter, but doesn't really extend his friendship beyond work.<br /><br />"In Good Company" works on so many levels. Dennis Quaid is awesome as the fatherly and wise Dan Foreman. Toper Grace is establishing himself quite admirably as a fine young actor. He plays Carter with much more honesty than arrogance. Sure Carter is a young, inexperienced hot shot; but Grace pulls off the character so that you really do sympathize with him and his dilemma.<br /><br />The chemistry between Quaid and Grace is completely believable, relatable, and intriguing to watch. The supporting cast of characters are all fine actors-but the two male leads really nail their characters to perfection.<br /><br />For this reviewer, "In Good Company" refelected what I thought of as a metaphor in the lives of older vs. younger in Hollywood as well as in corporate America. It's as if you have your more mature & well established actor (Quaid), passing the torch of experience to his younger nemesis turned ally (Grace). That's just my opinion of how well these two actors played off each other. After all, Hollywood is a corporation in itself.<br /><br />I also thought the movie had a fine & honest ending that leaves the viewer very satisfied.  It doesn't try to end on a phony, syrupy, & sappy note; like so much other Hollywood tripe these days.<br /><br />Just a  fantastic film..........all the way around.</p></body></html>

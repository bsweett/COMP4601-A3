This movie is no exception; however, it also boasts a mesmerizing parallel to the recruitment films used in Nazi Germany.  It has that austere, spare, let's go to war for all the right reasons feel to it. The cast is impossibly gorgeous and cut, much like Hitler youth as fashionable teens in outer space.  The special effects are nerve-jangling and robust; this is a grade-B movie with some high gloss.  For the best Paul Verhoeven film ever, see if you can find The Fourth Man, which is in Dutch -- it has the same wildly concocted imagination as this sci-fi thriller, but it also has brains.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The United Nations in the Interpreter is a liberal fantasy"></head><body><p>The Interpreter's utopian perspective of the United Nations provided by Sydney Pollock and his crew doesn't pass the laugh test.  Never mentioned is the real one's financial corruption and consistent kowtowing to dictators.  There are even a couple of snide remarks regarding the United States' decision not to fully comply with the UN war criminal courts and how most of the world supposedly (and implicitly with good reason) hates us.  All of the UN officials come across as benevolent and more than willing to bluntly confront national leaders suspected of genocide.  These people are remarkably efficient and relentless in the pursuit of world justice and peace.  Leni Reifenstahl would have been proud. Pollock lacks her genius ability to frame a shot, but he's the late film maker's equal as a propagandist.  This film is pure liberal propaganda.  Of course, what should one expect?  Sean Penn is an unapologetic spokesman for the radical Left.  There's no way that this ideologue would not push his peculiar point of view.  How did the investors get suckered into putting their money into this project?  Couldn't they sense a train wreck in the making?<br /><br />The plot is overly complicated and implausible.  The relationship between Sean Penn as a secret service agent and Nicole Kidman as the UN interpreter seems inauthentic.  Sparks do not fly between these two individuals.  Conservatives will shun The Interpreter, and liberals will feel uncomfortable with the violence. The latter prefer not to know that evil people truly exist. Political moderates will leave the theater bewildered and dissatisfied.  In two weeks, this film will be on its way to the video stores.  Nobody involved in this project will receive an Academy Award nomination.  Some things are best quickly forgotten.  This is definitely the case with The Interpreter.</p></body></html>

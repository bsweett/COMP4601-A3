I think that's a shame because it would be am unworthy ending the series. I liked the film but it could of been better. The whole thing with Picard having a clone was silly, wasn't explained that well how he got cloned either. Date has a brother android that looks just like him and it's not explained too well where he came from either. What the film has going for is the special effects, action and the performances of Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner. The under-rated StarTrek  First Contact is a much better film and the best of the next generation movies. If they couldn't of done better than that they shouldn't of made more Next Generation movies. That should of been the last one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Derivative, Silly, Scare-less, But Still Pretty Entertaining"></head><body><p>If you think 'AVP' can scare you like the first 'Alien' film, you are utterly mistaken.  Like 'Frankenstein Meets a Wolfman' or films with such titles, 'AVP' needs our clear understanding that this is a popcorn film for the fans of these series.  It's pure entertainment -- derivative but still thrilling actions with cardboard characters -- and surprisingly, it is fairly enjoyable as such.<br /><br />The story is not bad, considering the time gaps between the two series.  In the year of 2004 (which means, this year!) a team of academics led by an eccentric millionaire Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen, reminding us of his famous role)  try to examine the archeologic findings.  Unfortunately, they find themselves trapped in the pyramid-like constructions, where the fierce battles between Aliens and Predators are going to happen.<br /><br />The logics behind the apparently contrived situations look  forced at first sight, ignoring some parts of the films made in the past, but I think still the plot itself is pretty reasonable if not original.  The bad things about it is, in fact, that the derivative set-pieces are not scary or exciting as the writers think, and even the film's final scene (that is a clear sign of another chapter coming) is not really a surprise, being telegraphed from 40 minutes away.<br /><br />But I didn't hate the film, simply because Paul WS Anderson, whose past track records include not-so-great sci-fi films like 'Soldier''Mortal Kombat''Event Horizon' and 'Resident Evil' keeps the things going anyway, with good production designs and many references to the previous Alien and Predator  films in the past (see the way Henriksen uses a pen before his PC, tapping on the desk with it, for example).  And the film's unexpected turn concerning one Predator with the heroine Sanaa Lathan is a good idea.<br /><br />'AVP' is more like a novelty, so you cannot expect the same credible characters seen in James Cameron's sensational 'Aliens.'  No little girl, no suggested undertone, no Vasquez.  Still, the actions themselves are not bad, actors doing good jobs, CGIs fine (not perfect, though).</p></body></html>

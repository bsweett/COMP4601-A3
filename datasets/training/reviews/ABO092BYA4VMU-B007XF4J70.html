<meta name="summary" content="The perfect DVD for the perfect movie"></head><body><p>This movie is probably the greatest film achivement ever created by man,  and the romance between Bogart and Bergman will NEVER be matched.  A film this great can never be missed by anybody, and it is a truly powerful, moving, and beautiful film and it still remains so. There is not a false note in acting, story or characterization. This film won richly deserved Oscars for Best Picture, Director and Screenplay (but why didn' t Humphrey Bogart win Best Actor?)<br /><br />The DVD is enormous. It is one of the greatest multi-disc sets ever released.  Disc One contains the film in its correct 1.33:1 aspect ratio (that is fullscreen, and yes, widescreen is better, but this film was filmed in fullscreen and there was no such thing as widescreen at the time!)  And Disc Two contains a huge amount of features.<br /><br />Film: 10/10<br /><br />DVD: 10/10<br /><br />BUY THIS MOVIE. YOU WILL LOVE IT.</p></body></html>

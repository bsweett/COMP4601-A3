<meta name="summary" content="5 Star move/3 star video quality (if that)"></head><body><p>First, comments on the movie:  5 stars for this laugh fest.<br />I saw this movie (with a good friend) when it was first released in theatres and we both laughed ourselves silly at the half-packed matinee showing at the movie house.  If you are a fan of NASCAR at all, and/or if your neck might be a shade of red, you'll get this movie and be laughing throughout.<br />A dinner blessing/prayer that includes thanking the various sponsors, and a windshield laden with a sponsor message show the extents to which Ricky Bobby will go to get a buck from a sponsor.  None of which is far from the truth of the current state of NASCAR.<br />Will Ferrell plays the son of race car driver Reese Bobby.  The elder Bobby abandon his son and his mother years before, basically leaving his son with but a memory of his father mumbling something along the lines of "if you ain't first, you're last."  Words that young Ricky remembered forever.<br />Talladega Nights skewers NASCAR, NASCAR drivers, the partnerships that the driving teams make, and everything surrounding NASCAR, and does a great job at all of the above.  It's funny from start to finish, without being too crude along the way.<br /><br />Now, on the quality of the high-def on the Blu-ray version of this movie: shame, shame, shame on Sony for such a disappointing outcome with this disc.  Blu-ray is better than this.  Far better than this.  The original movie (on theatre screens) was better than this.  The video quality here -- where it should have been immediately impressive -- just isn't.  It's not horrible, but just doesn't seem like it's high def.  Instead it seems like someone forgot to remove or apply the correct filters.  Perhaps they were laughing too hard at the movie and forgot to hit the right switch while it was being manufactured, but it is not up to the standards one should expect of the Blu-ray format.<br />Worse yet is that in the extras on the disc the video quality is often times better (far better) than that of the movie.  That is something that one would never expect of a high-def disc.<br />3 stars (at best) for the video quality here.  Actually that's probably being generous.<br />Hopefully Sony will make another attempt at getting the video of this movie right and perhaps release a special edition version, or deluxe version in the future.  As much as I hate paying twice for the same content, I'd probably have to get it as I do love the movie.</p></body></html>

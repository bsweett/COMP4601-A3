<meta name="summary" content="Indiana Jones - The Last Adventure?"></head><body><p>After seeing the seemingly endless trailers on TV, I suspected this film was going to be awful, but I had to see it because I enjoyed the others so much.  Well it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be and I did enjoy this one, but it really didn't come close to the others so I only gave it three stars -- sort of a gift for previous efforts.  I felt that they took ideas and incidents from the previous films, warmed them over, and pasted them together rather than coming up with a new idea.  The result is constant motion, constant action, unbelievable escapes,some of the worst marksmanship I have ever seen, and all of this punctuated by some dialog -- errr-- acting.  The entire film from start to finish was highly predictable, right down to the unfriendly natives, and the shocking realization about the kid.  However, I did enjoy the give and take between Ford and Allen and they contributed the only acting in the film.  But -- this is truly a comic book and realism shouldn't be expected or anticipated.<br /><br />The villains are led by a Russian Villainess -- of sorts -- sort of the Cat Woman in disguise. This character could have definitely used some remedial screen writing and the sword was cheesy right from the start.  As soon as you heard Mutt say he took fencing you knew the sword fight was coming -- foreshadowing at the sophomore level.  Still it was fun even if it wasn't surprising and none of these villains ever seemed very threatening or evil.<br /><br />Crystal skulls do exist and whether there are aliens from Roswell is unknown but connecting these two seemed a little bit of a stretch even for a comic book type movie. I think they could have found a better vehicle than aliens and flying saucers but maybe this is a salute to all of those 1950's sci-fi flicks.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and it was fun to watch, but as a professional endeavor it ranks right up there with the Star wars Prequels- disappointing.  The actors did a good job with a very poor screen play.  Unless the screenwriters can return to their previous quality I would say let this be the last Indiana Jones Adventure.  By all means see the movie, you'll enjoy it, but you'll see why I was disappointed.</p></body></html>

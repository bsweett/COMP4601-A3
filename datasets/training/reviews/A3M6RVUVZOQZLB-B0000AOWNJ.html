<meta name="summary" content="Frisson at its best!"></head><body><p>I watched this film because I thought it was another I had seen several years ago. It wasn't. "The Ring" is much more. Another reviewer called it a cerebral exercise in terror. Exactly! What could have been so hokey became excellent frisson (that thrilling moment that makes your hair prickle).<br /><br />First, the premise: An urban legend that watching this particular video, receiving a phone call immediately after watching will cause your death in exactly seven days. Don't we pooh-pooh urban legends? "The Ring" makes us consider their validity.<br /><br />Second, the video itself. Where did it come from? Who made it? How? Why? So many questions, none answered, ever.<br /><br />Third, again the video. What do the scenes represent? The strange, surreal images?<br /><br />That brings in Naomi Watts' character, a reporter doubly bound in the story, first through her son, not unlike the boy in "The Sixth Sense" with his sixth sense for the supernatural. Aiden is definitely attuned to the other world.<br /><br />Secondly, Rachal is bound to the story through her research. Her niece watched the movie and died horribly seven days later. Rachal first watches the tape, then begins investigating the images. One by one she peels off the layers of this gothic mystery/puzzle/freakshow.<br /><br />Rachal's appearance in the movie parallels the changes with the story. At the beginning she is frankly beautiful, cool and assured. As revelations unfold and she begins to experience frisson, she begins a shift in appearance, becoming rumpled. By movie's end she is almost gray, as if psychologically preparing to join the urban legend dead.<br /><br />The viewer's frisson builds. The ending is a nightmare. "The Ring" is definitely a cerebral experience in terror.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br />One of those fast flashes of film reveals this: "Live birth." An intriguing bit of information that many viewers and reviewers missed or I misinterpreted. It explains better what happens at the well between Anna and Samara.<br /><br />A definite see-again movie!!<br /><br />Special recognition goes to Jeffrey Leach for his superb review. Please read his for a great overview of this haunting film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Del Toro finally gets it right in America."></head><body><p>Guillermo del Toro pops up for his third American movie, and finally, he gets it right. Hellboy is a rip-roaring ride through a comic-book world on which del Toro could impose his own conventions without having to live up to a prequel (as with the mindless, utterly disappointing Blade II) or trying to make an action flick that requires suspense (as with the mindless, utterly confusing Mimic).<br /><br />In the 1940s, the Nazis, with the help of Grigory Rasputin (Karel Rodin. Also in Blade II)-- yes, that Grigory Rasputin-- try to open a portal to another dimension to summon what would be, had they been able to get the licensing, Lovecraft's Elder Gods. (I mean, come on. All those tentacles.) They fail, thanks to an American company of marines, but during the brief time the gate is open, something does come through-- an infant demon. With the marines is a paranormal advisor to Franklin Roosevelt, who takes the demon and raises it as his son. It grows up to be Hellboy (Ron Perlman, who will forever be remembered for his role in the TV series Beauty and the Beast more than anything), the crux of a division of the FBI that fights the paranormal, along with Abe Sapien, who might be better known as Fishboy (played by Doug Jones, but voiced by Frasier's David Hyde-Pierce), and a cadre of human agents. The newest of the humans is John Myers (played by newcomer Rupert Evans), and Myers and Hellboy go through the buddy-cop routine, but with a twist; part of Myers' mission is to bring pyrokinetic Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) back into the fold. So it's a buddy-cop-love-triangle movie. With Cthulhu.<br /><br />The best part about the movie, really, is Perlman's wisecracking title character. The script puts him in some incredibly silly situations, but (and how much of this was actually scripted, how much was Perlman, we may never know) Perlman never lets Hellboy get through an absurd situation without remarking on its absurdity; for once, a truly intelligent action hero. It's about time. Add in a truly lovely nemesis in one of Rasputin's minions, the eerie Karl Kroenen (I'm sure the similarity to the name "Karl Rove" is a coincidence, but it makes the guy even eerier), a wisecracking corpse, a fish-man with a photographic memory, the potential a mini-Tristan-and-Isolde subplot (and this is really the movie's only failing; had they played that up, what fun they could have had), and John Hurt, and you've got two hours and change of out-and-out fun. Definitely worth seeing. ****</p></body></html>

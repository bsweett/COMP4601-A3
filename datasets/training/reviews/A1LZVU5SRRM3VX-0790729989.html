<meta name="summary" content="The 8th Deadly Sin Is Not To Own This Fantastic DVD!"></head><body><p>There are only a handful of films that are good enough for me to benchmark the experience of seeing them in the theater.  Se7en is one of those movies.  I saw the film for the first time with a group of friends on a college trip.  We went into the film laughing and joking, and when we emerged, we were all totally silent for at least fifteen minutes.  We were still recovering from the shock of this film, the benchmark by which I have since judged all suspense thrillers. <p>The film is exceptionally well-written, merging classical elements of the ars praedicandi (the ancient teaching texts to which Freeman's character refers in the film), with Dante's Inferno, and Milton's Paradise Lost with a serial murder investigation in a modern metro area.  While the exact location is nondescript, the location is simultaneously nowhere and everywhere, thus making this "everycity" that much more disturbing.<p>Freeman is brilliantly cast as the aging, jaded Detective Somerset, ready to retire, while Brad Pitt makes the perfect brash foil to Freeman's Somerset.  A character study in contrast, Pitt's impulsive irreverence keeps the viewer engaged and entertained, while Freeman's brooding Somerset provides necessary exposition and grounds the story with his shrewd, patient omniscience.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey's John Doe is one of the most frightening villans to have ever graced the screen, not merely because of the horrible murders the character commits, but because of the character's cool amorality regarding his own actions.  Gwyneth Paltrow and Leland Orser also make appearances in gut-wrenching supporting roles.<p>Not intended for those who are pregnant or nursing or for those who have heart or kidney conditions, this film will grab your viscera and twist them until you want to beg for mercy, then make you want to come back for more.  This is more than just another genre film.  It redefines the suspense/thriller genre, and its brutal ending becomes only marginally less upsetting on subsequent viewings.  <p>The Platinum Edition DVD is a must in this case.  With digitally enhanced negative transfer, digitally remastered surround sound, and loads of special features, the film finally looks and sounds like the masterpiece it is.  If you only saw this movie in the theater, you have not seen this film the way Fincher intended it to be seen. <p>Fincher's commentary track is, like the commentary on Fight Club, thoroughly entertaining and enlightening, and he has gone into the vault to provide us with an alternate opening sequence, as well as a coda-less ending, and a vastly different storyboarded ending that was never filmed.  Only special feature that could have easily been omitted is Morgan Freeman's whiny, self-absorbed commentary track.  I respect Freeman immensely as an actor, but he's rather annoying when allowed to ramble on unscripted.  <p>Another one of the best films of the 1990s, the Platinum Series version of Se7en is a must for any DVD collection!</p></body></html>

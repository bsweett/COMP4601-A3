Charles went blind from glaucoma when he was about seven years old, but the film illustrates how he overcame that obstacle, as well as many others, to forge a very successful career in show business. The movie also tells the story of Charles' triumph over drug addiction.<br /><br />The film makes liberal use of Charles' recordings, and I found myself dancing around my living room during some of the band scenes! The music is truly so intoxicating that it's difficult to sit still. I also especially loved the flashbacks to Charles' rural childhood, and how all of those scenes seemed to be shot in such bright contrasting colors - the red clay of the earth, the bright green of the grass, the multi-hued bottle trees. It made sense to me that, remembering, Charles would recall the world in such color.<br /><br />In addition, the period feel of the movie is carefully portrayed. Because all of the movie takes place before 1979 (and most of it takes place in the 50's and 60's), set designers, costumers, and props masters had their work cut out for them. All the visuals in this movie feel very authentic. These people did their homework.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx won an Oscar for his performance as Charles, and it was definitely well-deserved. I really enjoyed the fact that this movie did not sugar-coat Charles' life. He was a philanderer, a drug addict, and (often) a neglectful husband. But he did love his family, and he was a musical genius. Foxx (and the script) did a wonderful job of rendering him as a whole, and somewhat flawed, character.<br /><br />The performances of Kerry Washington (who plays Della Charles, Ray's wife) and Regina King (Margie Hendrix, who plays one of the Raylettes that Charles becomes romantically involved with) were both especially notable. I've seen Regina King in several other films, and I've always thought she was one of the most talented actresses around. She proves it in this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing Story Based on Real Life"></head><body><p>OK, we know Matt Damon knows how to play a spy: dead-pan, giving nothing away on his face. But this one is without all the judo and guns. This is a spy who does it all with thinking. Does not make for a very big action-type story, but it is interesting.<br /><br />Edward Wilson is a member of Skull & Bones, and we get some inside information on what that's like -- assuming it's accurate, which how would I know? Let's just say that what I do know of secret societies in general, it seems authentic. So that's the first thing that puts him in line, on the insiders' network for espionage work during WWII, in the OSS. Once the war is over and they realize they are going to need spies in the face-off with the Soviets, he is recruited for a major role (apparently number three man) in the CIA.<br /><br />After that, the plot gets very, very complicated. He learned early on that there is no one he can trust, and that becomes more and more true the longer he is involved. Unfortunately, his son grows up to want to be a CIA man, too. And that is really why the plot is so darn complicated.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil it for you. I can't anyway; I didn't understand half of what went on. I will need to see it another couple of times to figure it all out. But I wonder if I will bother. Frankly, it was disappointing.</p></body></html>

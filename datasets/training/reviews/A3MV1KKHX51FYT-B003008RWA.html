<meta name="summary" content="An Argument for Universal Health Care"></head><body><p>Sicko, 2007 film<br /><br />The movie begins with a man sewing up a cut on his leg. Another man cut off two finger tips on a table saw. Fifty million Americans have no health insurance. We meet a married couple who have health insurance, but heart attacks and cancer cost them their home. A 79-year old man works for his medicine. In 2006 Michael Moore began collecting horror stories about health care. You can't get health insurance if you have many, many diseases (such as a heart problem or diabetes). What if you have health insurance? You can still have a problem. Denial letters are rubber-stamped to keep a denial rate that is measured. Insurance companies look for ways to deny coverage to their customers. Physicians are rewarded for denying care, even if it results in a patient's death.<br /><br />Nixon speaks about health care; there was a trick here. Clinton tried to create Universal Health Care, but was defeated. Health Insurance companies have more lobbyists than there are Congressmen. Drug companies also buy Congressmen to get laws passed. George W. Bush raised costs for Medicare patients. The film explains the advantages of the Canadian Health System. Canadians must buy health insurance when they travel to America! "Even for a day." Those who need help get it right away in Canada. Canadians live three years longer on average. There is a flat charge for prescription drugs in Britain. No fee for medical services. We see how the "Cashier" office works in Britain. You get carfare. Democracy brought National Health Services to Great Britain in 1948, just after World War II. People in Britain are healthier than in America. [Is this part of political oppression in America? To keep people demoralized?] There is a horror story where a child was refused treatment and then died.<br /><br />We hear about medical care in France and its system. Doctors make house calls. Five weeks of paid vacation there. They explain the reason why: the government is afraid of the people, not the other way around. Moore interviews a family about their life in France. [No mention of taxes. Moore needs to push himself away from "Freedom Fries".] Back in Los Angeles we see how patients are dumped by the County Hospital when they can't pay their bills. In some places in America people help each other when in need (an old tradition). Volunteers who helped on 9/11 were denied health benefits. Insurance companies did this because the system works that way. Do the prisoners at Guantanamo get better treatment that people in America? [Moore is very clever in his examples.] Free universal health care in Cuba has the benefits of lower infant mortality and greater life expectancy (the two are linked).<br /><br />Documentaries lie on the continuum between fact and fiction. Authenticated events are often recreated for the camera. I think this movie would be better if it concentrated on Canada instead of foreign countries with different languages and cultures. Before 1945 America was the exemplar for personal liberty, but that has changed. Now many European countries are more advanced in personal rights because of their politics. The lack of universal health care correlates to political oppression (low wages and high taxes) since the end of World War II.</p></body></html>

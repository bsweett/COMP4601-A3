He eventually agrees to let her go but wants her to check in as soon as she gets into town but she forgets and he worries. The daughter and her friend meet a guy who seems nice but you know he is up to no good. We soon find out he finds American girls and kidnaps them and forces them into prostitution. Anywho, the agent is thrust back into work and vows to get his girl back at any cost. He goes all James Bond or Jason Bourne and goes to Paris (I cannot remember the country or city) and all hell breaks loose. The film is pretty much to the point and the action is non-stop and satisfying. It was over sooner then I expected but there was nothing left to do, every ground seemed to be covered. I highly recommend this to any action movie lover or anyone looking for a good movie.</p></body></html>

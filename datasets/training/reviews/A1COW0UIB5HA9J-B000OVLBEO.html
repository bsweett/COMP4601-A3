<meta name="summary" content="Exciting Marvel Comic film."></head><body><p>Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) was once a teenager who had a stuntman for a father and he was sick with cancer, so he made a deal with the Devil (Peter Fonda) to save his father's life and to fulfil his dream of being a stuntman. He's now grown up as he has become the world's most popular daredevil as he's got fame and fortune, until one night he becomes a flaming skull-faced demon avenger with supernatural powers named "The Ghost Rider" equipped with a spirited motorcycle. He is reunited with his former love (Eva Mendes), meets a former Ghost-Rider (Sam Elliot) and now the evil Blackheart (Wes Bently) wants to bring hell literally on earth, for only Ghost-Rider must stop him and retain his own soul back.<br /><br />An exciting supernatural horror action fantasy thriller from the director of "Daredevil" Mark Steven Johnson is based on a popular Marvel Coimc character. Stan Lee does a cameo as usual in the Marvel movies and this is no exception since he also produced it, the performances aren't too bad but the visuals are quite good even with the creature effects. Nicolas Cage isn't a bad choice for Johnny Blaze and Eva Mendes is certainly a cutie in this movie, i believe the unrated extended cut of this movie certainly makes a slight improvement over the theatrical release with never-before-seen footage.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Extended Cut has two commentaries, three documentaries, Sin and Salvation featurettes on the history of the Ghost Rider comic character, previews and Animatics.</p></body></html>

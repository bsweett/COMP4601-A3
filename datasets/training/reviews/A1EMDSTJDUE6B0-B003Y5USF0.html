The special effects are great (the kind where they are so good that you do not realize that they are special effects). The sound is very good. The movie itself is very good. The actors are excellent and help move the plot along at a good clip. Although somewhat predictable, it seems more true-to-life than many films. I have bought several hundred DVDs and sold many, but this is one that I plan to keep.</p></body></html>

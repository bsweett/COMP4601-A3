There are moments in the film that you will need to remember in order to understand what is happening.<br /><br />"Identity" is about 10 people that get stuck at a motel during a bad storm. One by one each of the 10 people are turing up dead. Meanwhile, in a place that is unknown a psychiatrist is trying to prove a man innocent convicted of murder. Without spoiling the film, this is all I can say about the plot.<br /><br />"Identity" is a great film that keeps you guessing to the very end. This is the way a great thriller film is made.<br />Also, John Crusack and Ray Liotta did a great job!</p></body></html>

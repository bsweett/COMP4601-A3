The entire cast really shines, but none as bright as Meryl Streep. She could have come off as a caricature Cruella Da Ville-ish archetype, but instead she's created a very real portrayal of a success-driven business woman who's devoted her life to her work.<br /><br />I was surprised at how little actually happened in the movie. At several points throughout the film I felt sure that something was about to happen, some event about to occur... but that never really happened. Although the plot does seem to move at a glacial pace, the imagery (New York streets and skylines), script, and acting really hold their own and keep an unveventful movie from becoming boring. In fact, it's quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Parts of the story are a bit contrived, and in a lower-budget movie they would have seemed laughable, but willing suspension of disbelief comes in handy here. If you enjoy fashion and scenes where the "other girls" drop their jaws because they're so impressed with Anne Hathaway's makeover, you will LOVE this movie. If you're not really into that stuff, you'll still enjoy The Devil Wears Prada, you just won't want to buy it, take it home, and wear it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mathew McConaughey's persistence pays off, much to Clive Cussler's chagrin..."></head><body><p>Sahara (2005) is an action adventure that largely delivers what you expect from a big budget film of this type, a likeable hero, a beautiful damsel, exotic locations, epic scale, cool action sequences, a touch of humor, a little romance, an ancient mystery, and hidden treasure.  Except for a major bad guy, it's all there, packaged within a decently constructed story.<br /><br />The film is based on a Dirk Pitt novel, one of over a dozen written by Clive Clussler, whose first book featuring the character was published in 1973.  While the books featuring Pitt, an ex-Navy officer turned salvage expert, may be fertile material with cinematic possibilities, prior to Sahara, only Raise The Titanic (1976) had been made into a feature film in 1980.  Cussler had apparently been so dissatisfied with the way Raise the Titanic had turned out, that he refused to permit any of his other Pitt novels to be made into films for over 20 years.<br /><br />Mathew McConaughey had great interest in playing Dirk Pitt, and contacted Cussler to discuss the possibility.  Eventually Cussler agreed to McConaughey playing his beloved character, although the actor had to agree to dye his hair dark, and wear green contact lenses, to match Cussler's description of Pitt.  With script approval, Cussler greenlighted the production, however he later had major objections, and took legal action against the production company.<br /><br />The movie incorporates many of the major elements from the book, a winding tale centered on Pitt's search for the CSS Texas, a US Civil War ironclad, he believes is lost somewhere in the African desert.  As ironclads were not the most seaworthy of craft, the possibility that one travelled from the east coast of America to Nigeria, would seem to be quite remote, but that is the premise here.<br /><br />Dirk Pitt fans may have strong feelings about how the character is presented, and how well the novel is translated to the screen.  Those without preconceptions, may regard Sahara as just another adventure in the style of Indiana Jones, with some James Bond influences.  Dirk Pitt comes across as a rather generic, nice guy hero type, who while not seeming particularly nautical, is perhaps more affable than in the books.  The principal casting is solid, with Steve Zahn as Pitt's best buddy Al Giordino, William H. Macy as James Sandecker, the head of NUMA (National Underwater and Marine Agency), and Penelope Cruz as doctor Eva Rojas.<br /><br />After rescuing doctor Dr. Rojas in Lagos, Nigeria, Pitt convinces his boss Sandecker, to allow him to head up the Niger River in a NUMA boat, to follow an obscure clue.  Eva Rojas hitches a ride on Pitt's boat to Mali, before departing to find the source of a plague.  General Kazim (Lennie James) the ruler of Mali, is colluding with businessman Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson) who is running a secret solar power plant in the middle of the desert, that is poisoning the water supply.  Kazim attempts to eliminate both the medical team, and the NUMA expedition.  Pitt's boat is attacked, and sunk.  Proceeding through the desert via camel, Dirk and Al manage to find Eva, just after her medical team has been massacred by Kazim's men.  While travelling by Jeep, the group is taken in by natives, the Tuaregs, and taken to their city in the desert.  There they meet Madibo (Paulin Fodoup), the Tuareg leader, and Al discovers a clue to the location of an ironclad in the desert.  The stage is set for an eventful final act, where the heroes discover the secret plant, the remnants of a lost airplane, and buried below the desert sands, the long lost CSS Texas.  The buildup is nicely done, but with Kazim attacking in a helicopter, the end of the conclusive chase is a little lame.  While the reality factor is low, overall the film is a pretty lively and entertaining romp, with a lighthearted tone.<br /><br />Regarded as a box office bomb, Sahara had a massive budget reportedly topping $130 million, and has apparently yet to make a profit.  Also part of the baggage that has become attached to the film, is the falling out with author Clive Clusser, which resulted in a lawsuit being filed against the production company, who in turn countersued Cussler.  The cases have gone to trial and the appeals process.  Judgments have been rendered, but a final resolution has apparently yet to be reached.  Odds are, we won't be seeing any new Dirk Pitt films anytime soon.<br /><br />Among the many special features are two commentary tracks, one with director Breck Eisner, and a second with Eisner and Mathew McConaughy.  The first is more informative technically, while the second is more informal.  Besides being the star, McConaughy served as an executive producer, and was crucial in making the project a reality.  Clive Cussler's involvement is briefly discussed, but there is no mention of any legal matters.</p></body></html>

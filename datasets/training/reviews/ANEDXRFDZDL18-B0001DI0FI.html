And when I heard the film was out upon DVD, I had to watch it.  Visually- I thought Master and Commander was stunning. In particular Russell Crowe as "Lucky" Jack Aubrey. The crew were well portrayed, and the ships and cinematography quite simply gorgeous. My one and only disappointment was the character of Doctor Maturin (Paul Bettany). For one thing. Where's his wig? Maturin always wore a wig. Second, the character was supposed to be Irish, and quite a bit more eccentric than he is portrayed in the film. This Maturin was quite normal, and even rather dull. Hmmm... Not how I envisioned this character. The actor couldn't even muster an accent!<br /><br />At any rate, the film was an excellent but shallow taste of the Aubrey/Maturin saga. If you like what you see here. Read the books. They explore the characters of Aubrey and Maturin in detail, and contain much more than just battles... But an excellent glimpse of what it was like to sail the seas in the 1800's.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="My Review Based On the "Original" film"></head><body><p>A friend of mine gave me the original, subtitled version of Hero, and I liked it... sort of.<br /><br />It is a very pretty film and some of the fight scenes are of Jet Li quality (really good) while others are "Crouching Tiger"-style high-wire acts (not so good). Jet Li stars in this big budget film as a soldier/assasin who starts questioning the motives of his king. He is the main reason why I watched this film and I was not disappointed by his stunt work, nor his acting ability.<br /><br />There is alot of talk about honor and Zen philosophy, a whole lot. People who went crazy over Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon will probably like this film more than me, it is much better than that dreck but I wish that it more wireless fight scenes in Hero.<br /><br />I recommend that people rent the original version, I'm sure this edited version has a different ending tailored for American audiences (a bad idea).</p></body></html>

In it Neeson plays a man who use to work for the Central Intelligence Agency and finds himself embroiled in trying to find his teenaged daugher who has been kidnapped by maniacs working for an Albanian sex slave operation in France.<br /><br /> The film is not for the weak: the torture scenes are violent, graphic, nail-biting, and extremely hair-raising which is why some of the scenes in the original version had to be cut in order for the film to receive a PG-13 rating. Those scenes that were cut are available on this two disc edition.<br /><br /> "Taken" is a well-acted, fast-paced movie that will not only please fans of actions movies, but fans of Liam Neeson; it's nice to see he finally has a huge hit on his hands. "Taken" took in over $222,000,000 at the worldwide boxoffice on a $19,000,000 budget with DVD sales raking in more millions.<br /><br /> In June of 2010 Neeson announced that he is in talks to do a sequel to "Taken".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Yet another revenge flick"></head><body><p>It's got a few twists and some stomach-turning violence and it's just another revenge flick in the end. And the end is so boring to boot. When a movie starts off with the killing and rape of the hero's loved ones, it really doesn't matter much what's next: the writer has already signified that he's lazy.<br /><br />Add some good actors (Meaney, Butler) and a fair actor trying way too hard (Foxx), saddle them with some insipid dialogue, kill a bunch of people, add a dash of torture porn, throw in some half-baked cries for justice, and bake at 350 for 108 minutes.<br /><br />Remove and let sit and realize you're looking at something that really ain't very tasty.</p></body></html>

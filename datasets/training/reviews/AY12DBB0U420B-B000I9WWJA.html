<meta name="summary" content="Promising Beginning, Tapered Off In Middle, Surrealistic  Ending."></head><body><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was the "Inside Man" DVD starring Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster and directed by Spike Lee. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was billed on the DVD cover as "A heist thriller like you've never seen." Well, there's a certain truth in that statement. The movie depicted a small, but very well-equipped group of men who invaded a bank and quickly took over and locked everybody in. There might nave been 40 or 50 employees and customers in the bank and they became instant hostages. Of course, the NYC police, with Denzel Washington in the lead role, responded quickly and moved a small army around the bank. Of course, there were  thousands of spectators and the area was crawling with news media people. Then the negotiations began. Of course, the gang wanted a whole list of things including an airplane to carry them away. Nothing seemed to work out and there was a threat to get this thing going or two dead hostages would be thrown out every hour. At this point the movie seemed like a somewhat more serious replay of "Dog Day Afternoon."<br /><br />But wait! A secondary plot was slowly developing in negotiations between the bank president, the Mayor of NYC and Jody Foster. It seemed that the whole bank robbery thing wasn't a robbery at all. No money was taken. No one was killed. A few people were roughed up. That was it. It was the bank president's way of retrieving an incriminating document from his own safe deposit box, the only one that was touched. It seemed that the document indicated that the bank president had dealt with the defeated German government during the ending days of WWII in order to get the money to establish the bank in the first place.<br /><br />Well, the whole movie just seemed to fitter away into nothingness. It had a real promising beginning, tapered off in the middle and then just went into this surrealistic Hollywood plot in the end and turned into a real flop, in my opinion. It became very disappointing as the movie progressed and the movie itself seemed to become longer and longer. I guess you might say that it was a high action movie in which the brakes had been applied and it ground to a boring ending. Too bad. The acting was good. The cinema and production values were excellent.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

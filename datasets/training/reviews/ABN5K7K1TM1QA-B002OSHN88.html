<meta name="summary" content="An atmospheric study in black and white"></head><body><p>I'm not one to rave about "glorious black and white" cinematography.  Generally speaking, if it was good in black and white, it would be even better in color (although NOT colorized).  However, there are exceptions.  Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove would not be improved in color, and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane would not even work as well in color, partially because of the "Movietone" and front page photography feel that Welles wanted, but also because color would add nothing to the sharp focus on an ultimately empty icon of an entirely black and white medium.  And Sir Carol Reed's The Third Man is a strongly atmospheric film that clearly is better in black and white.  It might be said that if there isn't enough light, it is false to pretend to color.  Flowers that bloom at night are usually white.<p>It's Vienna, in a winter month, just after WWII.  The city is still in ruins and rubble, still occupied by Allied troops.  There is a forlorn sense of loss and waste hanging in the air like a dark blanket of gloom, and the citizens still suffer from a shortage of consumer goods and basic medicines; a good part of the economy is still driven by the black market.  Spring and a colorful rejuvenation seem remote.  And so the sharp black and white Oscar-winning cinematography of Robert Krasker, imaginative and deeply evocative of a great city in darkness, was perfect.  From the ornate facades of old buildings to the wet catacombs of the sewers to the suddenly illuminated face of a slyly smirking Orson Welles, the camera carries the story driven by the zither theme, played over and over again, sometimes loud and insistent, sometimes soft and yielding, commenting all the while like an ironic jester.<p>But The Third Man is more than brilliant cinematography set to a haunting melody.  The well-chosen cast, led by Joseph Cotton as an urban American who writes pulp Westerns, and Alida Valli (who followed this performance with a long career in the Italian cinema) as the misplaced Anna Schmidt, and Trevor Howard as British Major Calloway, and of course Orson Welles as the dark and mysterious Harry Lime, was excellent all around.  The script by Graham Greene from his novel of the same name is intelligent and compelling.  The editing and direction by Reed paced the story nicely, neither too sharply cut nor too drawn out because this is a film that demands both quick action sequences and moments of mirthless pause for mood and reflection.<p>This is a great film because almost everything was done right.  The result is a work of art that invades and sets up permanent residence in our psyches.  I saw this for the first time as a boy many years ago and it remained in my memory as the most mysterious and eerie movie I had ever seen.  Seeing it again in the twenty-first century only confirms the experience of that small boy.<p>This is included in the film noir canon, and indeed it represents itself well there.  But The Third Man is better understood as a film of stark realism as well as a mystery in the tradition of an older genre that accepts the common standards of human decency as right and correct (as Catholic Graham Greene believed them) and does not give way to amorality or the success of evil.  Harry Lime is a man of charm and character, of intelligence and worldly wiles, but he is also a man with a sociopathic personality and a callous disregard for human life other than his own.  It is giving away nothing to realize that such a man in Greene's world, in the world of the mystery story--like something from Agatha Christie, perhaps--will not succeed in the end.  But what actually does transpire in the end, indelibly marked by the final shot of Anna walking directly in the middle of the road between two matching lines of cold, leafless trees, is from the school of realism, a realism born of nearly a century of intermittent war and recurrent human tragedy for Vienna, for Austria, for most of Europe.  There is in this film no compromise with that truth.<p>See this for Orson Welles, the 25-year-old wunderkind director and star of Citizen Kane (1941), here in his early thirties, enjoying the supreme compliment of starring in a film in which are employed, in frank imitation of his work in Citizen Kane, some of his original cinematic techniques.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Unusual Movie"></head><body><p>The day after a botched cocaine deal that resulted in a huge explosion in San Pedro Harbor, the only two survivors of the night are questioned by police and U.S. Customs Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri).  One of them is a Hungarian mobster who was severely burned and keeps yelling the name Keyser Soze.  The other is Roger "Verbal" Kint (Kevin Spacey), a crippled man who, despite his criminal record, has received almost total immunity by the U.S. government.  Agent Kujan interrogates him about his exploits with 4 other major criminals; explosives master Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin) and his partner Fred Fenster (Benecio Del Toro), and former crooked cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne).  Kint tells a very involved story that goes back six weeks to a police lineup in New York City.  It turns out that the 5 men were brought together by international crime lord Keyser Soze, a man who is equal to Satan in cruelty, shrewdness, and evil.  Furthermore, no one who has ever seen Keyser Soze has lived long enough to ID him, except for the man in the hospital.<br /><br />This has got to be one of the best suspense movies I have ever seen.  The plot is very involved and engaging, the actors are perfect in their roles, and it has one of Hollywood's greatest twist endings.  Definitely worth checking out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="British BOMB!!!"></head><body><p>Horror buffs need to take &quot;28 Days Later&quot; into muchly needed inconsideration.  This had to be the slowest moving horror flick on the planet.  While this British box-office smash was commended for chills and thrills..it is truly a fiasco.  It had two moments of terror...222 moments of predictable JELLO.  I spent $20 on this DVD.  It's worth maybe $5.99.<p>The soundtrack completely sucks...the acting is average...and the editing is the highlight.  Unfortunately, when you edit one bad scene to the next, you simply can't win.  <p>This British loser must have been made by someone who ventured through WW2.  It has the nauseating military twist to it that simply doesn't fit today.  Why is it the British always want to embellish their hatred for the Germans?  Move on!!!!  Get a life!!!!  Make a horror film and get away from those silly military fatigues.  This one is simply billed as a horror film.  That's right...it is simply horrible!!!  It gets a 2!!!  And that's being nice.</p></body></html>

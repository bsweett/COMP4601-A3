Everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves.  The acting is bad, the script is horrendous and the CG people apparently think their stuff don't stink...which it does-badly.  It's not the worse movie I've seen, but it's surprisingly close.  Please don't waste your time with this film.</p></body></html>

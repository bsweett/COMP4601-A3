<meta name="summary" content="Excellent final film from Kubrick"></head><body><p>"Eyes Wide Shut" is Kubrick's best film since "Barry Lyndon" and a fitting end to his remarkable career. All the Kubrick touches are there - the air of detachment, the tracking shots, the fisheye steadicam, the banal mixed with the bizarre, beautifully composed shots, excellent use of music, etc, etc.<br />The story concern a married couple played by (at the time) real-life married couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman for whom married life has become a little boring and where both parties are looking for some excitement although they know they shouldn't. Things soon get out of hand.<br />Tom Cruise is brilliant and so are all the other performance with the glaring exception of Nicole Kidman who struggles in a difficult role.<br />Some interesting interviews with Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, and Steven Spielberg are included on the DVD but nothing else.</p></body></html>

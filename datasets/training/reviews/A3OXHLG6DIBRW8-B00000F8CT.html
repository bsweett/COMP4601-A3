<meta name="summary" content="Very Good Sci-Fi Movie - Highly Recommended"></head><body><p>"Alien" is a very enjoyable action/horror/Sci-Fi movie that holds up well, even 33 years after it was originally released. This is the first (not counting the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LAIHY0">Prometheus (Blu-ray/ DVD + Digital Copy)</a> prequel) in Alien franchise, followed by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RE29PO">Aliens [Blu-ray</a>]. The Alien movies are generally well done, exciting, and well acted, making them standout from others in the genre.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The crew of a deep space "towing vessel" hauling mining ore is awakened from cryogenic sleep ahead of schedule to investigate a signal of unknown origin. The movie creates a great creepy, industrial feel that greatly adds to the realism and suspense. There is fairly good character development, which is actually much better than most movies in the genre. Sigourney Weaver stands out playing Ripley with a very strong performance and the supporting cast is also generally very good. The special effects are good for the time the movie was made and contribute to the believability.<br /><br />This is one of those movies I can watch whenever it comes on and we occasionally have an "Alien" marathon once a year or so where we watch all of the movies in row over a weekend.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

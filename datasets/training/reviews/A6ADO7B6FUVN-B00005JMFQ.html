Love is a word with many different meanings in regards to the relationship between people, but it is uniformly positive to how people interact to one another. Love in this film is most often meant as how the Merriam-Webster dictionary would put it: "1 a (1) : a strong affection for another arising out of kinship or personal ties (2) : attraction based on sexual desire : affection and tenderness felt by lovers (3) : affection based on admiration, benevolence, or common interests b : an assurance of love."<br /><br />The film displays several characters that are linked to one another in some way and how these people find a love connection with each other. The story emphasizes that time and place are irrelevant and that no one is above love as the story depicts the British prime minister (Hugh Grant) falling in love with one of his maids. The story also shows the first love as a young teen falls in love with the school's popular girl, and how love sometimes can be painful when it is not returned.<br /><br />Richard Curtis who also directed films such as Bridget Jones Diary and Four Weddings and a Funeral has previously displayed his skill in making romantic comedies. Love Actually continues to presents Curtis's skill to make light hearted, yet meaningful films where love is the essence. In addition, it is a film that will cheer up the audience while viewing it as it offers much humor, entertainment, noble notions, and much else to ponder. In essence Love Actually offers what it teaches, love, which provides an excellent cinematic experience.</p></body></html>

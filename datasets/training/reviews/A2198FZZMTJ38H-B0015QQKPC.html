Everything from the storytelling and directing, to the special effects and score, make this movie an epic that rises to heights of fame because the story it tells is a true one, done equal justice by the filmmakers. I stood up and cheered for this movie, which is one of the most accurate historical accounts I've ever seen. <p>We're first introduced to each of the astronauts who will take the fateful trip: Jim Lovell, the project leader, and his partners Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise. Originally scheduled to take a later space flight, the crew of the Apollo 13 mission is unable to take on the task, which bumps our three astronauts to the mission. No one thinks too much of the mission, it being just another in a long line of space explorations, while Jim's wife, Marilyn, has her own superstitions about the number &quot;13.&quot; Another glitch hits once Mattingly is grounded with a supposed case of the measles, forcing Jim to place Jack Swagert into the pilot's seat. <p>Nonetheless, the launch goes off without a glitch, but things go from hopeful to disastrous once a powerful explosion cripples the spacecraft and leaves the astronauts stranded in space, without any apparent hope of return. But the astronauts and the ground crew refuse to believe that this is the end, and their efforts become a thrilling race against time as they devise a plan to bring them home, while their families pray for their safe return and the world watches in sheer wonderment at the events at hand. <p>The movie rides to success on many things, but the most important of the elements is the impeccable acting from a terrific cast. Jim Lovell is played by Tom Hanks, who is optimistic and a leader once the going gets tough. Together with Bill Paxton as Fred Haise and Kevin Bacon as Jack Swagert, their scenes together are some of the best of the film, as they refuse to play their characters as one sole person. They must be strong and defiant of the possibility of death, while at the same time realize the danger of the situation they're in, and the three bring out these emotions wonderfully. <p>Supporting actors also add to the movie, the best of these being Ed Harris in his performance as Gene Kranz, the flight director stationed in Houston, Texas. His sternness and unrelenting attitude towards his crew and the new mission objectives prove to be effective, inspiring a sense of heroism in his character. Kathleen Quinlan portrays Marilyn Lovell, playing her as a woman who refuses to break down or entertain the notion that they astronauts will die. She comes off as strong and forceful, which is most evident in her refusal to allow a news crew into her house. Gary Sinise is Ken Mattingly, who proves he is intelligent and noteworthy as an actor by providing his minimum onscreen time with a performance that plays a big role in the story advancement. <p>While the acting is intrical, the setting for the majority of the movie is also very important, and the special effects do a tremendous job in bringing space to life. The technical effects for the spaceship are meticulous, while space itself is seen as a vast black expanse that requires no gooey aliens or monsters to be truly frightening. These effects are seamless, creating an ominous atmosphere that surrounds the characters as well as the audience with an overbearing sense of lifelessness and possible death. <p>The musical score also adds greatly to the overall effect the story has on us as an audience. Composer James Horner employs the vocals of Annie Lennox to bring a mournful and melancholy tone to slower scenes, while a vocal ensemble, strings and percussion combine to add intensity to faster sequences; most noteworthy is his piece for the spacecraft's re-entry into the earth's atmosphere. The music has a patriotic feel to it that keeps in sync with the movie's historical feel. <p>Director Ron Howard treats the story with a passion for accuracy, taking us on a journey into history to look at one of the most well-known events in our history. There is immense attention paid to the sequence of events as well as the obstacles that stand in their way. There is a nice flow to the story that never stops moving nor bends from its storytelling standards, which keeps the movie entertaining and enjoyable while never becoming boring or tiresome. <p>&quot;Apollo 13&quot; is definitely a modern epic which stands out as an impressive achievement in filmmaking. The story is a true one made believable by the efforts of the director and the cast, and made excellent by the seamless special effects and the musical score. For me, it's a feel-good adrenaline-pumping movie which tells a brilliant story of heroes and a race against time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Old School Creepy"></head><body><p>This paranormal thriller relies on understated sensual creepiness, which is excellently depicted through sound and intriguing cinematography.  Foreshadowing is its own character, though the suspense trickily misleads.  The directorial debut of Spaniard Juan Antonio Bayona, the film's producer is Guillermo del Toro, of "Pan's Labyrinth,"  in which del Toro blends the spirit world with the mundane as effectively.  Its refreshing realism is a welcomed departure from Hollywood hokiness, though a couple of scenes would be considered graphic by most measures.  The story is compelling, most definitely sad and playing on the sympathies of the protective.  If you enjoy old school spooky films, this one is a classic.</p></body></html>

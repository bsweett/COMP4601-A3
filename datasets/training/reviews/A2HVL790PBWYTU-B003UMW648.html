Lewis' Narnian chronicles are hallowed stuff to me, so I'm always gonna be critical of films adapting these books. Between you and me, I wasn't so enamoured with the first one, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition)</a>, feeling that it lacked the wonder and heart of the book. Then came the sequel. I remember sitting in the theater, with my arms crossed and thinking, "Okaaaay. Impress me."<br /><br />(Some SPOILERS follow.)<br /><br />Thankfully, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: PRINCE CASPIAN improves on the first film. And, even if it does veer away from the source material for a bit, the crux of the story remains the same. I guess it makes sense that the titular character is given more attention, although his tepid romance with Susan (which isn't in the book) unfolds almost in passing. Ben Barnes turns in a so-so performance, his Caspian relegated to going thru the familiar heroic posturings. He's really not even the main protagonist; that would be Peter. Hopefully, Barnes's acting improves, or the script does, because he'll play an even larger role in the third film VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER. But PRINCE CASPIAN, the movie itself, is pretty damn entertaining.<br /><br />The movie eventually shifts its focus on the four Pevensie children, but first we get caught up with some doings in Narnia, in which many ages had elapsed and the times again are troubled. The opening passage introduces us to the young Telmarine prince, Caspian, who is very soon forced to flee from his murderous uncle and his sharp-bearded soldiers. In his meanderings in the woods, Caspian comes across the fabulous folk and Talking Beasts of Narnia, thought to have become extinct during the cruel Telmarines' reign (or was it that they were never supposed to have existed, in the first place?). Within these expatriated creatures Prince Caspian stokes the fires of rebellion. And, so, the battle is on, to reclaim the old kingdom of Narnia.<br /><br />Note that, in his frantic flight from his uncle, Caspian had blown an ancient mystical horn, rumored to summon aid in times of dire need. Rumor's true.<br /><br />Back in World War II-era England Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie have grown a year older since their unlikely adventures, and they often wonder if they'll ever set foot on Narnia again. As they await their train in the hectic railway station, they quite suddenly find themselves whisked away from the bustle of noisy old England and into desolate, unfamiliar surroundings. The Pevensies stumble onto an ancient, broken down castle, and it shockingly dawns on them that they're wandering around in the ruins of Cair Paravel, their old home when they reigned as Kings and Queens of Narnia, and when Peter was High King. They soon unearth their most cherished treasures, those gifted to them by Father Christmas: Peter's sword and shield, Susan's bow and arrows, and Lucy's tiny bottle of healing cordial (Edmund, if you recall, wasn't around when Father Christmas was doling out presents). As expected, Susan's horn is missing.<br /><br />The Pevensies, not long after, fight off two Telmarine soldiers on a boat and rescue their sullen captive dwarf from drowning. A further chain of events would have the children learning that thirteen hundred years had gone by, and that, in the meantime, Narnia had been invaded by the Telmarines. The children soon encounter Caspian and his ragtag troops, which then allows for the epic stuff to be unleashed and for Aslan's inevitable return.<br /><br />One of my gripes in the first film was that I didn't buy into the actor playing Peter. But he's better in this one. Perhaps being a few years older helped him to grow into the role. The rest of the British kids are also good, although Georgie Henley as Lucy and Skandar Keynes as Edmund had always been spot on. Edmund actually is pretty good in a swashbuckling role, and Anna Popplewell (Susan) gets to actually throw down with her bow and arrows. But, when you get right down to it, the talented Georgie Henley still provides the most heartfelt emotional punch. There's a pure simple joy, wonderful to behold, in Lucy's unbridled love for and faith in Aslan.<br /><br />Deciding to insert even more thrills, the film strays from the book and invents new sequences centering on Peter and Caspian's exiled, makeshift army attempting to take the fight to Caspian's uncle, who happens to rule this new Narnia. There's also the return of an old foe, that awkward thing between Caspian and Susan, and leader-of-the-pack friction developing between Peter and Caspian. And again veering away from the book, Peter demonstrates an angry, combative side, which manifests early on, in a schoolboy row back in wartime London. It's... interesting. And I guess it's better than being bland, which is what Peter was in the first film.<br /><br />No gripes at all about the visual effects. No gripes about the look and feel of the movie, which is remarkable and epic (although not coming near the scope of, say, LORD OF THE RINGS). New characters come in and quickly ingratiate themselves. There's the endearingly surly dwarf Trumpkin, the wise badger Trufflehunter, and the chattery squirrel Pattertwig. There's another dwarf Nikabrik, who's even surlier than Trumpkin, but he's not exactly what one would label as "endearing." The best Talking Beast, hands down, is Reepicheep, the chivalrous mouse who brooks no insults. Reepicheep is voiced by Eddie Izzard, who declares that his character is "Mad Max crossed with a Storm Trooper." One of my favorite moments in the book is of the conversation between Reepicheep and Aslan regarding the magnificent mouse's hacked-off tail. I think the movie does it justice.<br /><br />Three discs in this packaging, plenty of in-depth bonus stuff. Disc One offers the feature film, as well as a fun audio commentary by Director Andrew Adamson and young actors Ben Barnes (Caspian), Georgie Henley (Lucy), Skandar Keynes (Edmund), William Moseley (Peter), and Anna Popplewell (Susan).<br /><br />Disc Two has the making-of featurette "Inside Narnia: The Adventure Returns" (35 minutes long); "Sets of Narnia: A Classic Comes to Life" (23 minutes) is a pretty neat segment, demonstrating that the bulk of the sets aren't CG - and you do get a sense of just how huge an undertaking the set-creating process is (also features Douglas Gresham, the film's co-producer and C.S. Lewis's step-son, who here reads brief excerpts from the book); "Big Movie Comes to a Small Town" - focusing on the small, picturesque Slovenian town of Bovec and the logistics of shooting the sequence in which the water titan destroys the bridge (23 minutes).<br /><br />Also on Disc 2: "Previsualizing Narnia" - about an animated storyboarding device called pre-vis, used in prepping for this film (10 minutes); "Talking Animals and Walking Trees: The Magical World of Narnia" - the cast & crew (but mostly crew) reflect on Narnia (5 minutes, kinda dull); ten deleted scenes with director's intros (11 minutes), none of which are particularly must-see, although one deleted scene develops deeper the attraction between Caspian and Susan; some okay bloopers (3 minutes); "Secrets of the Duel" - how Peter and King Miraz's duel was brought to life (7 minutes); "Becoming Trumpkin" - focus on Peter Dinklage, who's quite terrific as Trumpkin (5 minutes); and an 11 minute look at "Warwick Davis: The Man Behind Nikabrik" as we follow him during one arduous day of shooting (remember him in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXDD">Willow (Special Edition)</a>?). And Disc Three is the digital copy.<br /><br />So, I guess I'm finally invested in this film franchise and now find myself hugely anticipating THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, which returns Caspian, Edmund, Lucy, and Reepicheep, and also debuts the sniveling Eustace. It's a good thing that there's an ample turnover of sons of Adam and daughters of Eve in the Narnia chronicles. Else, these kid actors would be sprouting stubbles before the film series is done. Yes, I'm referring to you, Harry Potter franchise.</p></body></html>

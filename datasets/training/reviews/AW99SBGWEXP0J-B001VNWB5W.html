<meta name="summary" content="Watchmen"></head><body><p>In an alternate 1986, the US and Soviet Union are sliding towards war.  The Comedian (Morgan), a member of a disbanded group of superheroes called the Watchmen, is brutally murdered; setting events in motion that will change the world.  Rorschach (Haley), another member of the Watchmen, who happens to be a little unstable, sets out to find the killer.  He seeks the assistance of the rest of the team, Dr. Manhattan (Crudup), Silk Spectre (Ackerman), Ozymandias (Goode), and Night Owl (Wilson), to find the killer and is met with mixed reactions.  Still, he pushes onward, discovering a plan beyond his imagination .<br /><br />"Watchmen" is based on the vastly popular graphic novel by Dave Gibbons and an uncredited Alan Moore.  I have not read the source material, but have heard that the movie is very faithful to the comic with the exception of the ending.  The story is dense and complex and is not always easy to follow.  I don't think that is intentional, and that works against the film.  For the most part, the characters do not stand out.  The exception is Rorschach, amazingly played by Jackie Earle Haley.  He chews the scenery and simply steals every single scene he is in.  I would have loved to see more of him, but this is an ensemble film, so he is only one of many.  The film looks great.  Director Zach Snyder has a clear grasp of how to make a good looking movie.  In the end, fans of the book will be mostly pleased I think, but those unfamiliar with the work might be a bit put off.  This isn't a film for everyone, and I can only give it a marginally positive review.</p></body></html>

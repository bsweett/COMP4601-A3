<meta name="summary" content="It doesn't get much better than Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson!"></head><body><p>What's not to like about this movie? Cuba Gooding Jr., Greg Kennear, Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson as an OCD-suffering shut-in with a penchant for saying exactly what's on his mind.<br /><br />This movie renders some of the more classic lines in cinematic history, including "Sell crazy some place else. We're all stocked up here." And the ever popular "You make me wanna be a better man." There's no telling how many 16 year old boys got to go a little further with their unsuspecting prom dates after uttering that line.<br /><br />The movie itself tackles a lot of social issues in a very subtle if tactful but direct manner. It was very well done and very smart in the delivery of a moral that's all about accepting the differences of those around us and living in a world where love and respect for said differences truly can conquer all.</p></body></html>

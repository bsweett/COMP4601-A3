Lowering my rating of 21 Grams from `6' to `5', I felt that the film was far too long, manipulative in creating misguided social messages, and heavy handed in the drama department. Watching all the main three of the cast to perform was like an exercise of how to make the situation as pathetic as possible. And they succeeded by letting 21 Grams to have very little entertainment value. Sean Penn was his own boring self and Benicio Del Toro gave a better performance in Traffic, but it's Naomi Watts who turned in a very strong performance as the depressed widow who also lost two daughters in a freak car accident. Although the editing of the film was very adroitly done (however, been there and done it before in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction), I still suffered much from the shaky camera work. All in all, the story wasn't very interesting in 21 Grams, and 30 minutes should have been cut out of the length. As a matter of fact in regards to the title of the film, it's not true that the body loses 21 grams immediately after death.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A brilliant prison film"></head><body><p>From the first frame right through the final cut, The Green Mile is an astonishingly powerful, suspensefully crafted picture that is extremely hard to fault. Nominated for 4 Academy Awards, the movie has at its centre a moving performance by Michael Clarke Duncan, one that left me numb a little while afterwards. He pulls off a brilliant showcase with Tom Hanks, who has stunning screen prescense. The script is charmingly sad and brillianty planned, while Frank Darabont (who also wrote) gives very plausible efforts in his directing. Although the result is a film that misses the best film ever made quality of 1994's The Shawshank Redemption, also by Darabont, this is still an elegant picture that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.<p>One last thing, ignore the bad-mouthings about the length of The Green Mile. I didn't mind it, and it has such a high level of intrigue and utter superbness that 3 hours will feel like 1 to you too.</p></body></html>

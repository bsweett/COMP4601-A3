<meta name="summary" content="The previews were scarier then the movie"></head><body><p>I'm not talking about the previews of THIS movie. I was more scared by the previews that were shown before this movie than I was by the movie itself. It had a couple of moments that scared me, but the music in this film was misleading. It would seem that something scary was going to happen, and then nothing happened. The movie was extremely slow and anticlimactic just like (The Ring). If you want to be scared, buy (28 Days Later) on DVD. This movie was more of a tragedy then a horror. By the end, I felt sad and confused.</p></body></html>

I haven't enjoyed a movie so thoroughly the first time through, thought about it for months afterward, watched it again, and was even more astounded by it, ever. Given that it's three-hour running time may turn off the audience members with cases of ADD, but for those of us who stick around, it's a filmmaking experience like no other, driven by the kinetic energy of a director whose sheer joy for the art gives every moment on the screen poignant meaning and visual grace. &quot;Magnolia&quot; was written, produced, and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who uses the music of the under-appreciated Aimee Mann as a temp-track that underlines the entire movie, beginning with the opening to her song &quot;Deathly,&quot; and working backwards. Mann's music is always at the soul of the movie, starting with her jazzed up remake of &quot;One,&quot; getting under our skin during a brilliant montage of all the main characters singing &quot;Wise Up,&quot; and finally knocking us flat on our collective rears with her inspired &quot;Save Me.&quot; (She was robbed by Phil Collins at the Oscars) Yet, amongst all of the music from one of the world's most gifted musical artists, there are some of the finest screen performances of 1999. These performances, along with some fabulously bizarre cinematography from Robert Elswit, are what truly push the movie from its oddly engaging opening monologue to its final heartwarming smile. To describe all of the characters in &quot;Magnolia&quot; would take forever, and considering all of that has been kindly outlined by the folks here at Amazon, I won't repeat it. I'll just say that &quot;Magnolia&quot; contains some of the most originally written characters in the history of cinema. Tom Cruise is electrifying as Frank TJ Mackey, Julianne Moore is terrific as usual, Melora Walters (written with a hint of Aimee Mann insanity) is as jumpy as a grasshopper hopped up on meta-amphetamines, but she pulls it all off nicely, and Philip Seymour Hoffman always wins us over with his heartfelt performance as the nurse to the sickly Earl Partridge, played with devastating authenticity by the late great Jason Robards. And those are just my personal favorite characters. ... I'll say it again, this is one of the very best films I've ever seen, and working in a video store, I've seen a lot of movies. It's endlessly inventive, engaging, wonderful, heartwarming and breaking at the same time, with an endless supply of life being fed into it by one of the best directors since Scorsese. ...</p></body></html>

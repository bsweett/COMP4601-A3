<meta name="summary" content="I miss Linda Hamilton!"></head><body><p>He promised he'd be back, and he is in "Terminator 3-Rise of the Machines," the third and probably final installment in the franchise that made Austrian weightlifter turned actor turned politician Arnold Schwarzenegger a household name. Why do I think this film is the last in the series? Because, primarily due to Arnie's abrupt reversal in his views about onscreen violence. "Terminator 3" isn't a great film. Before he had kids and decided to run for public office, Schwarzenegger had few problems blowing away hundreds of people in films like "The Terminator," "Commando," "The Running Man," "Predator," and several other 1980's actioners. What a difference a few years make. I knew Arnold had taken a turn for the worse when I witnessed the horrific "Junior," but the disintegration had begun years before. Schwarzenegger's dogged pledge to minimal onscreen killing essentially doomed any "Terminator" sequels. Granted, number two worked well because it employed Linda Hamilton, had James Cameron at the helm, and worked wonders with special effects. Sadly, "Terminator 3" does not have Linda Hamilton, does not have James Cameron at the helm, and the special effects aren't as good as what we saw in the second film. What a pity.<p>John Connor (Nick Stahl in this outing) survived the events in the second film and is now a young adult with serious issues. Always fearful of any unexpected robotic deliveries from the future, he's dropped out of society in a big way. Connor doesn't have a phone number, avoids credit cards and other traceable technologies, and floats from menial job to menial job. His mother Sarah died of leukemia several years ago in Mexico, thus leaving her son to fend for himself in a world that he fears. John can never shake the feeling that he and his mother failed to prevent Judgment Day, and he is about to discover feelings have a way of becoming real. Sure enough, a termination unit appears on the scene. This time out, it's the new and improved T-X machine (played by sexy Kristanna Loken), a robot wrapped up in the guise of a female capable of controlling other machines and sprouting weapons from its body. Fortunately for John Connor, the humans in the future managed to send back another Arnie terminator to serve as a personal bodyguard. From here on out the movie is your typical chase and destroy vehicle, as Arnie and the T-X battle their way through various settings.<p>The plot makes a few digressions with the introduction of Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), an old childhood sweetheart of John Connor who just happens to meet up with her old flame when John robs the veterinary clinic where she works. Moreover, Brewster's Dad just happens to be the military guy in charge of Skynet and a new generation of robotic weaponry instantly familiar to fans of the first two films. See how it all comes together? Arnie ends up protecting Brewster and Connor from the deadly attentions of the T-X. When queried by Connor and Brewster about Judgment Day, Arnold explains that nuclear annihilation is inevitable, and that Sarah and her son only postponed the inevitable when they destroyed the T-1000 in the second film. Since the world is about to go into the wastebasket, it is Arnold's mission to get Brewster and Connor to a safe location before the bombs fall. Predictably, our heroes aren't about to accept the fate of the world lying down. They convince Arnie to escort them to the military base where Kate's father is about to put Skynet online. If they can get there in time, they might succeed in averting disaster. Meanwhile, the T-X stalks them with relentless, ruthless precision. The conclusion to the film displays lots of explosions, nicely done special effects (again, not as good as the second film), and a few mild twists and turns.<p>"Terminator 3" could have been a great film. I fervently hoped it would attain greatness. Alas, the movie achieves only a rating of merely good. Of course, the biggest problem is Arnie's inability to mow down people. Let's face it--we all loved Schwarzenegger's early films where he wreaked massive destruction on scores of heavily armed thugs. You won't get any of that here. What further hurts the film is the absence of Linda Hamilton. She always gave the series a solid foundation, and the film suffers without her. They could have at least given us a cameo from Michael Biehn or Robert Patrick to serve as a touchstone to the earlier movies. Nope. The only person we see from an earlier film is the guy who played the psychologist, and even then his appearance doesn't work as well as it could. Plenty of other problems abound, including plot holes like Arnold just showing up at the veterinary clinic out of the blue, (In the other two movies, Cameron showed us HOW the terminator tracked down John and Sarah Connor. Here, he just shows up.) and the over reliance on comedic elements throughout the film. What works? That chase scene with the crane was cool, and the fistfight between the T-X and Arnie is worth watching more than once.<p>Give "Terminator 3" a chance if you liked the first two. I've sort of knocked on the movie in this review, but I probably would watch it again if I had the chance. It's sad, though. The filmmakers could have made an ultra dark, nihilistic science fiction film instead of this comedic parody of what made the franchise such a winner from the start. I blame Arnold Schwarzenegger for the film's failures; it's obvious that in order to get him to do another film, the filmmakers had to give Arnie free rein to do what he wanted instead of giving the fans what they craved. Let's hope future installments--highly unlikely, regrettably--will return to the roots of the original.</p></body></html>

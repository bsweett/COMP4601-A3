<meta name="summary" content="Realistic People; Unrealistic Menace"></head><body><p>The realism of the people and small-town settings portrayed here draws us in and bands us together with the party trapped in a grocery store, waiting out the coming of whatever ferocity is in the surrounding mist. The camera work and lighting puts us right in the faces of the frightened, beleaguered shoppers. I felt as if I were walking directly behind the store manager, peering over his shoulder as he circulates around the store, whispering counsel, quelling rising tempers, helping to plan escape. Toby Jones does a brilliant job in this part, a total departure from his role as Truman Capote in "Infamous."<br /><br />All the actors turn in compelling, realistic performances as each in turn gets spotlighted in the beam of whatever improvised light the shoppers devise when night falls and their power is cut.<br /><br />However, I can't be quite as enthusiastic about the creatures that strike out of the mist. Sometimes these artifacts, with their improbably akimbo limbs and their almost human, craning, questioning faces - even seem to be vaguely comical. With all the advances that have been made in fabrication and CG effects in recent years, these menacing arthropods still didn't seem to match the frightening realism of the attackers in decades-old movies such as "Them."<br /><br />Still, the movie is worth watching. It will take you out of yourself into that store-under-siege.<br /><br />Not all of the bonus material on the DVD is as worthwhile though. The Director's commentary is a little flat and uninformative and you can skip it unless you have a lot of extra time. It will be enough to listen to the Director's chat with Stephen King, from whose early short story/novella this picture was drawn. And you can also listen to just the commentary accompanying the movie's outtakes to get enough of an idea of the budget techniques used to create the effects in this film.</p></body></html>

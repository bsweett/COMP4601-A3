The FX have been upgraded and the story expanded, but that does not make for a better movie. I appreciate that fact that film isn't an exact remake as I really don't see the point of that at all. If you look at some of the best remakes like Carpenter's 'The Thing', Jackson's 'King Kong' and Cronenberg's 'The Fly' who all made remakes with stories more complex than the originals even if not necessarily better. This film just doesn't reach that status as a great remake that rivals the original.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="the best suspense film I have seen in years"></head><body><p>When I saw this, I had no idea that there were another complete version of the work available, but had been told the novel was great by my wife.  This film so completely absorbed and fascinated me that I watched it twice on a trans-Atlantic flight, each time reveling in the details and the absolutely superlative acting.  We know Craig is first rate - but so is Roony, whom I had never seen before.  Indeed, she is pitch perfect:  a damaged, enigmatic woman full of rage, with a particular talent, perhaps even genius, and a streak of cruelty.  I will have to buy this when the price is right, as I will want to watch it many more times.  I will get the other versions as well.<br /><br />A disgraced journalist, Craig, is given a task by an ailing industrial magnate, who recognizes his family is full of crazies.  Craig becomes absorbed in the task, eventually taking on Roony as his assistant.  She soon proves invaluable, fighting her own battles all the while and emerging as a stunning and dangerous beauty.  Somehow, he touches her heart, unlocking secrets but also sensitivity and pain.  What they find was a complete surprise to me in all of its facets.  I don't want to reveal the plot, as it has many quirky twists that add subtle tastes to a somewhat traditional film noire plot line.  But the resolution, and the girl's actions, make this the most deliciously wicked treat.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.</p></body></html>

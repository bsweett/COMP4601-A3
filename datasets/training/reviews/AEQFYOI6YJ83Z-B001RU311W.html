It chronicles the career of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay politician, and his struggle and triumph against bigotry.  The script, by Dustin Lance Black, is one of the best in recent years; Black earned his Oscar and all the acclaim he's garnered.  Van Sant's directing is something to behold; the film is a seamless flow of "archival" footage and "new" footage, interlaced to tell the story of the struggle.<br /><br />It is the acting, though, that really ropes in the viewer.  Sean Penn won a Best Acting Oscar for his portrayal of Milk, and he earned it; he sinks into his role, disappearing behind Milk's persona, creating an iconic film character, a modern day Atticus Finch.  Josh Brolin, as Milk's political adversary (and eventual assassin) Dan White, turns in another great performance; he exudes a sense of unease and self-loathing, and would surely have been a shoe-in for Best Supporting Actor had it not been for the late Heath Ledger's iconic performance in THE DARK KNIGHT.  James Franco shows yet again that he is a genuine talent; following a string of second- and third- rate roles, he showed his talent in PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, and now here again, in a moving, powerful performance.  The other primary supporting roles--from Emile Hirsch, Alison Pill, and Diego Luna specifically--are all well cast.<br /><br />MILK is a movie for our times.  It is powerful, persuasive, emotional, funny, romantic, and entertaining; in other words, it's everything a film could hope to be. Watch it and be moved.  Watch it and learn something about true humanity.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Alien 3-You Can't Fight the Statistics"></head><body><p>Alien 3 holds the record as being the most disappointing movie of 1992 and certainly the worst of the Alien series. The fact that 3/4's of our favorite surviving characters from Aliens is all eliminated before the movie even gets rolling was an immediate bummer. The overall depressing pace, color, texture, grit, taste and even the powerful musical score made one require an extra dose of their favorite anti-depressant after seeing the movie. That is my overall impression of the movie which I still give high points to.<br /><br />While the consensus of opinion is mixed I would have to agree with the statistics published by AMAZON which are flat and show no clear trend from a large population of Alien fans who were very disappointed in this movie. You can't fight the statistics. The fans just couldn't enjoy even a skillfully done Alien 3 with the feel of a death camp.<br /><br />I believe the main problem with Alien 3 is that the plot was developed in a series of steps by excellent people selected by the studio who picked up the job where it was left off by others. The studio assumed that it could be done that way if it had to be, and it just can't.<br /><br />As the numerous DVD extras include terrific and always interesting technical materials on the making of the movie I would recommend this DVD for all ALIEN fans. The two disk version has the original theatrical movie version as well as a longer version with a slightly different but no less depressing plot. This alternate version, which suffers from a poor sound track, was also interesting to screen when one has the time and inclination. The DVD provides the option of subtitles for interested viewers wishing to indulge their curiosity in an alternate version of Alien 3.</p></body></html>

Except that it is one great action movie.  It's has one man (Bruce Willis) vs. a large gang of international terrorists who have come to rob the US headquarters of a large Japanese corporation.  He has this skyscraper at his use to try and outfox these bad guys and he makes the most of it.  It's one exciting scene after another and, all the while, he has to worry about his wife being a hostage of these terrorists along with her fellow office workers.  Bruce Willis was made for movies like this and he comes across like some sort of redneck Jackie Chan.  There are plenty of twists and turns throughout the movie and we find ourselves frequently on the edge of our seats.<br /><br />I usually expect to be inspired, touched, or otherwise impressed before I consider a movie to be great.  However, sometimes I just want to sit down, relax, and not have to concentrate in the least.  Unfortunately, there aren't many movies for that mood that are worth watching.  However, "Die Hard" is one I can watch and enjoy anytime I want to take my mind off everything else.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR!!"></head><body><p>jennifer garner plays her role just right. great innocence, great drama, great love. it's like she wishes to be 30, then she is and she doesn't know what to do. she a grown up growing up. then she finds out that the real adult world is cruel and backstabbing, and what you need is true friends, and hers is her true love, but he's getting married. so she wishes she can just go back in time. how ironic, but greatly played out. romantic, laughable, and very entertaining. i do recommend.</p></body></html>

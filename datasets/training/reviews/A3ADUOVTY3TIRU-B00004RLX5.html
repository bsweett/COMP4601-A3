<meta name="summary" content="Cool Movie"></head><body><p>I remember watching this in the theatre when it first came out and now that all the films are available on DVD I have been steadily collecting them..This is one of the best in that it has a fantastic commentary by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy that offers quite a bit of insight into the making of the film! This film has quite a bit of humor..more so than the earlier and subsequent films..I think this made the film a lot more fun and gave us more of a glimpse into the characters and chemistry among the original cast..I think Nimoy did a fine job of directing the film and from what I understand this film was one of the bigger successes of the 6 films..no wonder..it's a classic! Like many of TOS episodes I feel the producers and directors of the films wanted a lasting testament to the ideals that Gene Roddenberry first crafted in his original stories..they did a fine job! The DVD quality is excellent and the audio is amazing!</p></body></html>

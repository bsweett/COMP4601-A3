<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing comic book film"></head><body><p>Ever seen a movie that just left you with a bad taste, that just thoroughly depressed you?  That's how I feel having just watched "The Punisher".  G-R-I-M is the word to describe this movie.  This would be OK if the revenge part of it was compelling, but unfortunately "The Punisher" fails in this area too.<br /><br />The movie never recovers from its first act, and specifically the scene where the title charatcer's family is murdered.  Not only is it an ugly scene to sit through, but it also mercilessly lingers on, as a truck chases and mowes over people pathetically trying to flee.  After watching this, you want The Punisher to just destroy everyone that was involved.  Unfortunately, this is where the movie fails big time.<br /><br />Most of the villains do get their inevitable comeuppances, but it's not really satisfying.  At least two of the villains' ends are so pathetic that I just wanted to scream at the filmakers.  The big mistake is having The Punisher exact is vengeance in a round-about way, by sowing seeds of suspicion between the villains and having them kill each other.  This is somewhat interesting, but also very sloppily done, and unfortunately denies the audience what could have been some great action scenes.  There is some action here, but not nearly enough, and at two hours the film seems to drag on forever.<br /><br />John Travolta is simply not captivating as the villain.  I suppose his performance is adequate, but his character's not nearly despicable enough.  His worst action in the movie- killing The Punisher's family- is not even directly ordered by him.  To make it worse, he lets The Punisher manipulate him like a puppet, making him more pathetic than menacing.<br /><br />My final complaint is the movie's tone.  It's all so grimy, dark, and depressing.  Since the movie's main plot fails to be captivating, this makes it a chore to sit through (in this way, the best comparison to a modern comic book movie is "Daredevil").  The first two "Batman" films and the unfairly bashed "Hulk" movie may have been downbeat, but they were vibrant, colorful films with terrific action sequences.  "The Punisher" takes place almost exclusively at night, and very few action sequences manage to raise the pulse, making the whole affair just downright depressing.<br /><br />"The Punisher" is not a bad movie- the acting is overall good, and there was definite potential- but it simply is not one I can recommend.  If you're looking for a good comic book movie, there are many better ones out there- the "Spider-Man" and "X-Men" films, "Hulk", and "Hellboy" all come to mind.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="There is only one reason to watch this movie."></head><body><p>_Underworld_ features a confrontation between rival clans of vampires and werewolves (called &quot;Lycans&quot; in the movie) in a dark cityscape (supposedly Budapest, apparently) supposedly over the evils of miscegenation between the races.  Whatever.  Anyway, this movie was pretty bad.  The plot was nonexistent and the story didn't make sense.  So why am I giving this movie 5 stars?  Well there is only one reason to watch this movie.  And that is for Kate Beckinsale - dressed all in black with a black leather trench coat, she's so snazzy!  :)  In fact, if you get sick of the rambling story, the nonexistent acting, and the lame dialogue, I recommend you just turn off the sound and watch Kate in peace - running around and looking cool.  Bravo Kate!</p></body></html>

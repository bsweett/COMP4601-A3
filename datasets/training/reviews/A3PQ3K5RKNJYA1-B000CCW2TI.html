<meta name="summary" content="Cool! Rachel McAdams can save me any day"></head><body><p>The plot leads one to think that McAdams as Lisa can't handle the pressure or control the situation brought upon by the smooth-talking terrorist Jack Rippner (played by Cillian Murphy). You get the feeling she's going to be one of those hysterical female types, intimidated by a terrorist. Rippner uses both mental and physical abuse during the flight back home, to get Lisa to switch hotel rooms of the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security (using her Management Power and Authority) so that his cohorts get a good target to hit. Brian Cox plays Lisa's Dad, who is the unsuspecting hostage that will be killed unless Lisa complies to Rippner's demands.<br /><br />Ah.. but, Lisa ends up kicking butt. She first performs an unscheduled "trachaeotomy" on Rippner with a pen (i.e. stabs him in the throat), and then escapes just as the plane lands. She then proceeds to steal an SUV from the "Departing Flights" drop-off area and uses it to smash into and send the would-be assassin of her Dad through the front doors of the house. And finally, as Rippner catches up to her at the house; takes him for a tour of the house (a la hide-and-seek) before she and daddy put a couple of holes in him.<br /><br />Jayma Mays plays Cynthia, Lisa's co-worker and front desk agent at the hotel. She lacks confidence, is not very well organized and space-out to a point of being annoying. But she, like Lisa is able to "keep cool" when the chips are down, and ends up being a life-saver in the end. She really turns out to be quite cute with her lines. Especially her ending line in the movie.  SURPRISINGLY GOOD MOVIE.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Horrible!!"></head><body><p>M. Night Shymalan totally lost it.<br /><br />A movie about an natural disease spread in the air that causes people to commit suicide. Mark Walberg escapes the city with his wife and the daughter of his best friend. They are chased by the disease in the air every where they go and manage to escape it. They do not die in the end because it seems the disease stops one day after it started.<br /><br />We do not know what the heck this disease is about! Is it nature taking revenge because humans are ruining it as it was theorized in the movie? Why did Mark Walberg and his wife not die in the end? Is it their love, or is it merely that it stopped one day after it started.<br /><br />We have no clue. I can't believe Shyamalan wrote and directed this film, and I can't believe Mark Walberg agreed to act in it.</p></body></html>

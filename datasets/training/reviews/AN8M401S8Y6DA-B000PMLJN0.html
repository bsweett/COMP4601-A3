<meta name="summary" content="Save the money and purchase a cheaper version,  and not the hd.  Features also listed below"></head><body><p>I own about 40 Hd-dvds now, when they first came up I was re-buying alot, now I tend to wait for something new that I don't own or I re-purchase it if I really liked it.  I also figured prices of Hd-dvds would come down by now after the first year like dvds did but surprisingly they have not.  As for dead silence the sound and picture are always good on Hd dvd, also horror films in general have good sound, however this one does not stand out.<br />Great horror films can get us to forget what makes sense and get us to accept it.  They can also be realistic and terrifying and hone in on some hardwired fear we have.  Horror films can also purposely be so bad there good.  This really isn't any of the above.  The scares are the equivalent of me hiding and jumping out at you.  I think i guessed nearly everything that happened in the movie prior to it happening.  Other random things i found annoying, why does Donnie Wahlberg's character use a electric shaver everywhere? , why do we have to have ominous fog around a cemetery, bit cliche.  There are a lot of holes yet I don't lose myself in the movie and accept it.  As for the plot amazon provides a good enough description, no need to add to it.<br />Yes, I have seen worse horror movies, and yes this is a break from the torture porn genre however there are other picks for 2007 out there.  If you want to stay on the Hd dvd kick try The Host, again getting away from the torture porn, and one of the best reviewed films of the year getting a 92% positive rating on rottentomtoes out of 129 film critics whereas Dead silence got 17% positive out of 63 critics.  Better yet The Shining is now available to pre order on Hd dvd being released on October 23rd.  If you have a need to watch killer dolls, watch or re watch Child's Play.<br />My advice is if you like horror and you want to check out some new on dvd for 2007 just buy a cheaper version than the hd.<br /><br />Dvd features from box<br />Exclusive alternate ending and alternate opening<br />Deleted scenes<br />The making of dead silence<br />Mary Shaw's Secrets<br />Evolution of a visual fx and more</p></body></html>

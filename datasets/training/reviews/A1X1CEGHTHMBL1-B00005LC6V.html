<meta name="summary" content="Spectacular werewolf movie that was a fresh remake of an old story!"></head><body><p>Backpacking across England seemed like a great idea for a vacation.  Americans David Kessler (David Naugthon) and Jack Goodman (Griffin Dunne) were having a great time until they got dropped off near the moors and walk into a small pub to warm up and get some food and drink.  When Jack asks about a five pointed star on the wall of the tavern everyone in the pub begins to act strangely.  Not feeling welcome the boys get ready to leave and they are told to beware of the moon and keep to the road.<br /><br />After they leave the pub owner tells the people there that they have to go get the boys and that they shouldn't have let them leave the pub.  A loud howling is heard outside and the pub patrons lock the doors and refuse to go outside.  Jack and David suddenly realize that they have left the road and are deep into the moors and the full moon has just come up.  They hear the howls and are being hunted and then they are attacked by a creature. Jack is killed and David survives as the pub patrons arrive with guns and kill a large creature that dies and turns into a man....<br /><br />This movie is just one of the classics of the werewolf genre.  It is well filmed and it has great special effects and some plot twists that are really good and make the story very creative.  To top it off the acting was excellent.  It was a fresh look at the werewolf stories and that is why it as so wildly popular.  I love this movie and it is also one of the favorites of my family.  This is one of the best monster movies ever produced and it will always remain near the top of my favorite movie list.  I recommend it to you.</p></body></html>

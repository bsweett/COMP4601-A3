<meta name="summary" content="Sometimes tall tales can produce big rewards..."></head><body><p>There is something extremely entertaining about Tim Burton's `Big Fish'; a mature fairy tale about a young man trying to understand the man his father truly is.  Burton has a way of taking what could easily become syrupy or saccharine and turning it into something sweet yet honest; never overplaying his hand so-to-speak.  `Big Fish' follows that formula, delivering to the audience an overload of mystical creatures and faraway lands and beautiful imagery wrapped up in a tender story about a father and son yet it never once comes across immature or childish.<br /><br />This is a plus and a minus in this case, but I'll get to that in a minute.<br /><br />The film revolves around Will and Ed Bloom.  Will has never really understood his father; in fact he appears to have a deep seeded contempt for him and the fact that he feels he was never allowed to get to know him.  This is because of all the `tall tales' Ed proceeded to tell Will his whole life.  When Will hears that his father is on his deathbed he travels home, hoping to finally hear some truth regarding his fathers life.<br /><br />What he gets is...<br /><br />Like I mentioned, `Big Fish' is visually beautiful to witness.  The sets and the costumes and the vivid use of colors are classic Burton all the way and manage to draw the audience into the fanciful world.  The stories told are all cohesive and fun to entertain.  This has a lot to do (or should I say everything to do) with the script, adapted from Daniel Wallace's novel.  Watching the stories unfold we can see clearly their truths amidst all the colorful exaggerations and this adds to the beauty of the story `outside' the stories that is unfolding between Ed and his son.<br /><br />The performances by the entire cast are wonderful as well, especially that of the two Ed's, Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor.  Albert Finney is truly one of our finest actors that ever has graced the big screen (his relentless Oscar losses are crimes against humanity) and he brings so much of his natural charm to this performance you can't help but adore it.  Ewan McGregor likewise captures the fire still burning in Finney's eyes and exemplifies it as the younger, fantasy version of Ed Bloom.  I adore McGregor as an actor and feel he has a wealth of talent under his belt.  In `Big Fish' he is as magnetic as usual and delivers a top notch performance.  Jessica Lange is marvelous and touching as Sandra, Ed's wife, and Billy Crudup manages to make Will believable and relatable.  Recent Oscar Winner Marion Cotillard does a fine job with what little she is given and makes a lasting impression; albeit because she is stunning and possesses such unforgettable beauty.<br /><br />The immense cast of `fantasy' characters are all brought to life vividly as well thanks to strong performances by everyone from Helena Bonham Carter to Danny DeVito and Steve Buscemi.  Alison Lohman does a fine job as the younger Sandra as well.<br /><br />In the end `Big Fish' is highly entertaining.  It is a fantasy tale that the whole family can enjoy and it manages to teach a beautiful lesson about family relationships.  This is also where that whole `anti-saccharine' element can be a minus.  What is great about `Big Fish' is that it feels honest and `adult' throughout, yet what I miss is that uncontrollable emotional connection that is supposed to overwhelm the viewer as the film draws to a climax.  If Burton had only kicked up the `syrup' for the ending, then I could feel this film was perfect.  There is a balance needed when doing anything, and while one does not want a film that is one big mushy mess we should never underestimate the value of some well positioned waterworks.</p></body></html>

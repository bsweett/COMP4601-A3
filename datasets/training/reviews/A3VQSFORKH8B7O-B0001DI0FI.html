THIS SHIP IS ENGLAND.&quot;"></head><body><p>&quot;Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World&quot; is one of the finest naval films ever made. The battle sequences are outstanding, the visual effects exceptional (You could never tell where they used CG and model effects), and the acting top-notch. Russel Crowe delivers a powerful performance as Captain &quot;Lucky&quot; Jack Aubrey, and is given a strong supporting cast that includes Paul Bettany (&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;) and Billy Boyd (&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; Trilogy).<p>The single-disc DVD offers few extras, but the film is given great picture and sound. Whether you're buying the two-disc set, or the single disc edition, &quot;Master and Commander&quot; is a movie not to be missed!<br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+</p></body></html>

NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 2. THE EXORCIST 3. DAWN OF THE DEAD 4. SUSPIRIA 5. PSYCHO 6. EVIL DEAD 7. NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST. (part one) 8. HALLOWEEN 9. ALIENS 10. CREEPSHOW ..Now if you've heard of this film you've likely heard of the other films on this list. As an adult I don't become scared when I watch horror films, I have way to much knowledge on how movies are made to ever really become frightened while viewing. However, the titles listed above are great horror films to me. And I'm not saying that I don't jump sometimes when something on screen jumps at you with intense music to back it up, we all love when that happens. I'm 28 years old and I've been a fan of horror films ever since I was still in the single digits, do you remember the first time you saw a zombie rise from the grave? It was like losing some kind of virginity. As for this horror masterpiece.. any horror film that has witches, zombies, fire, numorous violent murders of ballet dancers, &amp; a soundtrack by the devil will always get high marks in my book.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Original, Top-Of-The-Line Vampire Horror"></head><body><p>It's hard to do much original with vampires after literally hundreds of films featuring the creatures, including excellent picks like "Near Dark" and "Bram Stoker's Dracula", but "From Dusk 'Til Dawn" is one of a few over the last decade that's injected fresh, vibrant blood into the always popular vampire subgenre, and has helped keep it a healthy subsection of the horror field.<br /><br />  With great performances from an excellent cast that includes George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Salma Hayak, Quentin Tarantino, Ernest Liu, Tom Savini and Kelly Preston, it's odd in that for almost the whole first half of the movie there's no indication at all that you're seeing a horror movie.  What you've got is a superb suspense thriller/whacked-out crime drama about two convicts (Clooney and Tarantino) abducting a family in their motorhome to make a getaway down to Mexico.  When the horror elements come in, they don't creep in gradually but kick in the proverbial door howling for blood, driven by some of the best monster effects ever seen.  I don't know if this kind of pacing would work in a lot of movies, but it was extremely potent here.  A fantastic horror movie that, because of its superstar cast, has the potential to draw new fans into the entire genre.</p></body></html>

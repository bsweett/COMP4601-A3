A reviewer captured the feeling well in saying that one gets the sense that everyone in this film was born to make it.  It is as if Destiny herself brought together this gripping story, capable director, and legendary actors to inspire one of the greatest cinematic works of all time.  Very few films allow for multiple viewings among non-fanatics.  But though I have seen THE GODFATHER over half-a-dozen times, I never fail to thoroughly enjoy the experience.  It never fails to pull me into the dark and intriguing web it weaves.  And, though it is three hours in length, I never pause it to attend to the rest of life.  This film demands your attention and holds you captive from start to finish.<br /><br />Let us begin with the plot.  THE GODFATHER breaks free from all stereo-types.  It is not a traditional "mob" movie in the sense that it does not rely on violence to energize an otherwise predictable and pedestrian plot.  This film, while quite violent at times, does not dwell on violence.  Instead, we see the true life of the mafia: a world run largely by businessmen in closed meetings.  Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is an aging Don of the Corleone family.  He has spent his entire life building up the family from the humblest of beginnings.  Now, in his old age, the Don is failing to keep up with the tides of change and his life is threatened for it.  As the Don's control begins to fade, someone from the family must step forward and "take over the family business."  Two mean step forward: the eldest son, Sonny Corleone (James Caan) and the family consigliere, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall).  But for all his enthusiasm, Sonny is hot-headed and ill-fit to lead.  He lacks the patience, understanding, and "reasonableness" of his father.  And Tom, while close to the family, is not blood and is, perhaps, too much like the old Don to move the family forward in the twentieth-century.<br /><br />As it turns out, the only member of the family capable of leadership is the youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  Ironically, Michael is the favored son--someone the old Don had plans for and the son who could finally break free of the family business and lead a normal life.  Michael is reluctant to have anything to do with his family's business affairs.  At the outset of the film, he does not associate himself with the family, he is in love with a woman he hopes to spend his life with, and proclaims himself to be "nothing like his father."  Of course, the tragedy of the series lies, in part, in watching how good men, like Vito and Michael Corleone, become evil men through a series of little compromises.<br /><br />The acting in this film, as all reviewers agree, is superb.  Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is often said to be the greatest of his career.  Brando manages to breathe life and complexity into the old Don.  Whereas many "mafia" films rely on stereotypes and cardboard characters, Vito is someone we would love to have as our grandfather.  He is kind, sensible, patient, and wise.  It just so happens that he is also, at times, ruthless in his business affairs.  Hats off to Brando for being able to convey that complexity.  I could go on about the excellence of the supporting cast, but Al Pacino really deserves our attention here.  Pacino's performance of Michael Corleone is widely regarded as one of the greatest film performances of all time.  What strikes me about this film every time I watch it is the degree of character movement and development that takes place during its run time.  At the beginning, we see a Michael who is somewhat shy and reluctant.  We see that same Michael become saddened and outraged when his father's life is threatened, and we see him coolly and confidently transition into his role as Don, effortlessly and ruthlessly establishing his position in one swift blow.  Pacino manages to make his movement legitimate and believable.  We feel that time is passing and the years are changing Michael--all within the confines of a three-hour film.  That's incredible and Pacino deserves more credit for it than he was given at the time of the movie's release.<br /><br />Finally, in addition to the great screenplay and terrific acting, Francis Ford Coppola shines in this film.  The film has beautiful direction, beautiful cinematography, wonderful pacing, great lighting...the list goes on.  THE GODFATHER gets everything right.<br /><br />You cannot go wrong with THE GODFATHER, particularly at the ridiculously low price you can obtain it for.  The new edition is beautifully done and will be an instant favorite in your film collection.</p></body></html>

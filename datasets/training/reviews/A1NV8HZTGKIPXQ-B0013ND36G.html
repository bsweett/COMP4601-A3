This is how you do it. Arnold may be getting older, but he can still show the young 'uns what an action film is. Are you listening Mr. Diesel?. The plots to these films are filled with techno gizmo and all that kind of stuff, so it hardly matters what exactly the movie is about. After all, it all comes down to the action and the special effects. This one has got it all. The first two films in the series were classics in the genre. It's tough telling how this one will rank in the series with die hard fans, but I am here to tell you that this is one fun ride. So, how exactly do you come back after the groundbreaking part 2?. How do you top it?. Apparently, after seeing the movie, you don't. The effects are fantastic and cool, but they don't seem to build much upon part 2. The female terminator is incredible, but her attributes don't outdo or better Robert Patrick's from the previous film. Basically, it just stays with the flow from the second film with eye popping action that outdoes everything in action films in recent years and great effects. The story takes place ten years later, although it has actually been twelve years since the last film came out. John Connor, now played by Nick Stahl, has been keeping a low profile. He has no phone, no address, and lives on the street. Can't find him that way. A female terminator named the T-X, played by beautiful Kristana Lokken, comes to town with one thing in mind. Kill John and prevent him from becoming the future leader of humankind. She starts going thru everyone associated with him and leaving them in body bags. In comes the T-101 cyborg(Arnold)to protect John, although he was originally designed and programmed to be an assassin. His mission is to also protect the lovely Kate Brewster(played by the lovely Claire Danes), who is an old acquaintance of John's and has a connection with him in the future. Arnold must keep them alive, keep the terminatrix at bay, and stop machines being controlled by computers and destroying the world. Arnold is back in action and reclaims the action king crown. He's getting older, but it is definitley not an issue. He doesn't look much different than he did 12 years ago. I would still much rather see a 55 year old Arnold Schwarzenegger, or a 60 year old Harrison Ford, than a 25 year old anybody else. This film also has a welcome dose of humor as well. It is able to be funny and crack jokes and play with itself. Other action films take themselves so seriously, that they are laughable. Again, must I mention "XXX"?. Stahl and Danes are most welcome as the two human heroes. Stahl is a likeable presence worthy enough to cheer and root for. It is somewhat surprising to see Danes in a movie like this. She really fits well tho. She is human and brings real human feelings and emotion to the proceedings. She is very sweet and lovely looking to boot. Kristana Lokken does what there is to do with the character. She is icy and cold and lethal. It also isn't a negative thing that she is nice to look at. The dialogue is pretty tight, from what you can make out of it from all of the technical mumbo jumbo, and everything moves right along at a nice pace. There is even a cameo from Earl Boen, who appeared as Dr. Siberling in the original film. Nice touch. It is a bit sad that Linda Hamilton wasn't involved. She was missed. The movie is everything you'd expect from an action movie and everything you could want in a Terminator film. The action is incredible. It just keeps coming. A chase scene with firetrucks and all is an impressive sight. Teriffic. So, it's a slam bang, fun filled action ride that is sure to please die hard action fans. I enjoyed it a lot and I think anyone interested in this sort of thing will be too. Diesel still isn't ready to play with the big boys.</p></body></html>

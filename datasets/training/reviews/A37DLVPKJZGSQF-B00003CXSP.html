The critics didn&#65533;t think it was too flash, the censors gave it mighty high ratings and most sequels, according to some people&#65533;s philosophy, aren&#65533;t worth the time. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and I wasn&#65533;t distracted by any of the above. At the start I honestly found Hannibal a little boring, but when the cool detective story comes in it gives the film a little more life. We needed something else to keep the film going however, because it was missing the chemistry of the first. When Lecter finally enters the United States, things heat up. The gore splashes everywhere, the scenes are more exciting, the characters get meatier (in both senses of the word) and the audience will start to get more involved. The detective story in the first hour or so in the film is very well played and neat, the killings in the movie are creative, the cinematography is beautiful and the soundtrack is stunning. At times the film goes a bit off-course and is a wee bit laughable, but it remains enjoyable in the focused parts of the movie, which is a lot of the film, not much of it is really &#65533;bad&#65533; bad. Ridley Scott directs the movie fabulously and gives us stylish and memorable scenes. Some scenes in the movie are memorable in a bad way, though, I&#65533;ll warn you now. The acting is brilliant, with Julianne Moore fabulous as a more determined but less interesting Clarice Starling, Anthony Hopkins as a scarier and less mature Hannibal and Gary Oldman who is great but completely unrecognisable as grotesque make-up covers his face. Hannibal is a gross, great and gory re-visit to the character we enjoy so much, I recommend it to people who either enjoyed the first film or enjoy very extreme deaths in movies.</p></body></html>

"Planet Terror" delivers in a huge way, by spoofing just about everything you could hope for.<br /><br />Just because this is a hilarious parody/comedy doesn't mean it's for kids, though. There's a lot of disturbing material here, often more disturbing because it's humans behaving badly, rather than simply zombies doing what zombies do. In one of the most horrific cinema scenes I've ever scene, a young boy shoots himself because he is too young to responsibly handle a gun (or he doesn't feel capable of being saddled with the instruction to kill anyone who approaches - even his abusive father). In another scene, an attempted rape comes to a disturbing halt due to the inability of the would-be rapist to maintain...structural integrity of his melting genitals. This isn't exactly light-viewing we're talking about.<br /><br />Yet as a deconstruction of the genre, "Planet Terror" is superb. Every trick in the director's book is used with hilarious effect, including a false "missing film" / "intermission" during which all the introductory misunderstandings and usual "coming to grips with the situation" material all occurs without the audience being privy to the material. This is a particularly nice touch, in my opinion, since the "let's face it - they're zombies" speech really has nothing new to contribute at this point anymore.<br /><br />If there is a downside to this movie, it is that Rose McGowan receives her leg-weaponry far later in the film than previews would have viewers believe - but every second afterwards is golden, climaxing in a truly hilarious ending that will have all zombie fans rolling on the floor laughing. If you like zombie movies, and like making light of them, "Planet Terror" is for you.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

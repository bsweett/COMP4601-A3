Thank God they ignored that crap that passed for Superman III and IV.  I could have done without the prolonged explaination of Lois' son.  That just got a little old after a while.  After about 30 seconds, we all knew whose kid it was.  Spacey steals the show as Lex Luther, but even here, we could have done without the bumbling of his henchmen...a criminal mastermind can't hire better help?  For what it is, it's a good ride.  Superman still delivers.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A full-charged blast of grindhouse glory"></head><body><p>It took some time, but Robert Rodriguez finally got around to making his fake Grindhouse trailer Machete into a full feature film, and boy oh boy, it was mostly worth the wait.  Danny Trejo stars as our title hero: an ex-Federale on a vengeful mission who finds himself betrayed and left for dead when an assassination plot on a bigoted Senator (Robert De Niro) goes awry.  There's more to the story than that, but what there is in terms of story doesn't matter a whole lot as Rodriguez and his co-director Ethan Maniquis manage to craft and weave so much outrageous, bloody mayhem that you can't help but admire it.  Still though, Machete doesn't conjure up the same kind of B-movie greatness that Grindhouse managed to do, but it does a great job on its own merits regardless.  That, and a surprising cast featuring hotties Michelle Rogriguez and Jessica Alba, along with Steven Seagal (!), Jeff Fahey, Don Johnson, Cheech Marin, and Lindsay Lohan (yes Lindsay Lohan); all of which help make Machete such a blast to watch.  All in all, Machete doesn't mine the same kind of B-movie gold that Grindhouse managed to, but it's a blast all in itself, and wholeheartedly worth your time.</p></body></html>

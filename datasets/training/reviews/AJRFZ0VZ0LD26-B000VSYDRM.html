This is a story about young man who can express himself only thru his sense of smell.  He is deprived in every way except in his ability to experience pleasure in cataloguing smells of the world around him.  Ben Whishaw is fantastic in portraying this character with all his depravity for motherly love, decent upbringing and childhood, desire to survive harsh life at any costs while bringing misfortune to all his encounters along the way - starting with his own mother from the day of his birth, perfume master who teaches him a trade and yound women, whose ethernal essence his tries so desperately to preserve.  Is this story about the man with a special gift, or a story of love that is destructive in all its beauty; is it a story of one's purpose and all the emotional numbness that comes from need to experience love and obtain one's own essence in this world- no matter what the cost?  The character of this movie is so intense, in his own way - he is greater than life itself in spite of the fact that the only way he can express himself is thru creation of the ethernal (love) perfume that disarms all around him.  This poor soul is not seeking riches, or fame, or power -- all he wants is to experience love and beauty he has never had.  He commits the unthinkable for the brief moment to experience such hapiness.  You will carry images from this movie for a long, long time.  Excellent story, talented director and fantastic cast.</p></body></html>

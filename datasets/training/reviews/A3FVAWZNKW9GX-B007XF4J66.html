<meta name="summary" content="Tension of Values in Casablanca"></head><body><p>Above the plot and the intrigue, and the great actors and incredible dialogue amd music. Beyond the filmwork and characters, and the tension of war... OK... that alone makes this a great movie.<p>Beyond all of that is a love story, and a story about what matters in life.<p>Rick is faced with a decision about a lover now married to someone else. With this, he must also consider not just her husband, but the impact stealing her back would have on her and her husband's efforts to stop the war.<p>Adding to the reviews here is difficult. Buy it, and if you don't buy, rent it. You'll be back to buy it later. It really is that good.<p>I fully recommend this movie on every level I can.<p>Anthony trendl</p></body></html>

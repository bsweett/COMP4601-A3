<meta name="summary" content="Missing Christoper Reeve (and Gene Hackman for that matter)..."></head><body><p>Twenty-odd years have passed since the last Superman movie, so I guess it's high time for a new one for the new generation of moviegoers, like my daughter.  Having never seen any of the "first" series, she thought "Superman Returns" was great.  Having seen the first series, I wasn't so psyched by the return of the screen version of the Man of Steel.  "Returns" seemed to borrow much of its plot (and some dialogue, as I've read) from the original Superman; Brandon Routh borrowed his look from Christopher Reeve, and Kate Bosworth seemed too young to play Lois Lane five years after her tryst with Superman. Kevin Spacey brought more evil and less humor to the part of Lex Luthor, who's still obsessed with beachfront property--this time by creating a new continent in the Atlantic to push the ocean up and over the Eastern US.  Secondary players Frank Langella and Sam Hutchinson were just fine as circulation hound Perry White and awestruck Jimmy Olson.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good "extension" with a moving Worthington performance"></head><body><p>"Terminator: Salvation" is a worthy addition to the franchise, featuring great state-of-the-arts special effects, an engaging storyline, and strong performances.<br /><br />Speaking of the latter, Sam Worthington has the more sympathetic part of a man, ripped from his criminal and murderous past to become a heroic figure of the future.  Worthington balances "butt-kicking" with emotional vulnerability that certainly make his the more memorable character to star Christian Bale's "John Conner."<br /><br />"Star Trek's" Anton Yelchin is also surprisingly good as the young Kyle Reese, managing to downplay his native Russian accent that he purposely "overplayed" in the Trek film.<br /><br />Welcome "appearances" are made by both Linda Hamilton - in the form of a photograph and voiceover - and Arnold himself in a rather computer-generated way.</p></body></html>

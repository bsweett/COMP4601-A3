It is a very effective chiller with a great mystery at it's core.  The direction is well-paced, intelligent, and clever and, in addition, he solicits terrific performances from the principal actors.  The cinematography is perfectly dark and moody.  While this film definitely falls into the traditional haunted house horror genre, it is leaps and bounds above the norm.  The images in this film stay with you much like the ones in "The Ring" (an admittedly better and scarier film).  My wife and I were totally blown away by this film.<br /><br />I admit that I can be rather permissive in what I let my kids watch, but this is one film that in spite of it's PG-13 rating and lack of gore and violence, I would not let them see this film because I know the images would stay with them and frighten them for nights to come.  They love horror films and love being scared and have rarely had nightmares following a spooky film, but I know from past experience that certain kinds of horror films will get to them and since this one got to me and my wife there is no way for them to watch it.<br /><br />This is a truly frightening film and is just as frightening on multiple viewings.</p></body></html>

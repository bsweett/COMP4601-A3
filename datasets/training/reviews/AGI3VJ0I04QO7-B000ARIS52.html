It is true to the source material but when adapting a comic to another formal you need to adjust it to that format. This has not been done here. In essence you get a moving graphic novel. If this was to be adapted to a novelisation would the source material be used so literally. I think not. This film was all style over substance. Bad story, lame characters, lame action. It gets one star for Rutger Heurs great performace.</p></body></html>

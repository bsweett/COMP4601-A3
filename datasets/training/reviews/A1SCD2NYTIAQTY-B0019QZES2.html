<meta name="summary" content="A Good Introduction"></head><body><p>While this is not as good as the first movie, ("Meet the Parents"), this movie does a good job of carrying on the Focker story from the first movie. It also has to be said that the first movie would have been a seriously hard act to follow.<br /><br />The story line is pretty similar to the first, with a few differences thrown in to spice things up. While it is not as gut-wrenchingly funny as the previous installment, it is actually a very good laugh.<br /><br />Robert De Niro is his usual best being the cold and paranoid Jack Byrnes, with his "circle of trust" thing. He is brilliant in the "fish out of water" role as Jack struggles to cope with a completely alien environment. Stiller is still putting on an excellent act as Gaylord Focker, and does well in a role that changes through the movie. I won't spoil the changes, but just add that it is good to see.<br /><br />I must add that Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand really rock as Gaylord's parents. They are truly hilarious and completely the opposite of the Byrnes, (some interesting developments there, too, as the movie goes on). Streisand is remarkably good at comedy, something which I had not guessed she had a talent for, (I have not seen many of her movies before). With Hoffman and Streisand, the makers cast the perfect people for the role of the Fockers. They were simply brilliant, and were superb in every crazy way.<br /><br />This movie is one that you will not regret seeing. It is funny, at times touching, but also just mighty good comedy. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though my stomach did not hurt as much as it did with "Meet the Parents".</p></body></html>

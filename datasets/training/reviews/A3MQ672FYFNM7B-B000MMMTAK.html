Along the way he falls in love with Pam Anderson and decides that he is destined to marry his dream-women. This is Borat's first time in the US so he isn't used to the customs or modern conveniences (such as a commode that flushes.)<br /><br />Along the way Borat meets, interviews, and speaks with various Americans. "Borat" is a thousand times more vulgar than any other adult-comedy and makes "South Park" look like a sweet Disney picture.<br /><br />I loved when Borat met with the feminist organization in NY and referred to one of the ladies as "pussycat." It was pure comedy and so offensive. I don't think this was scripted? Borat's sidekick, Azamat was also very funny. When Borat and Azamat had the nude wrestling match I thought I was going to wet my pants, I never laughed so hard.<br /><br />Borat takes cheap potshots and Jewish people, homosexual men, women, African American people, and the physically and emotionally handicapped. His ignorant comments are very offensive and make him sound extremely stupid. But as Borat speaks to various other Americans on his journey it is soon apparent that many Americans also share Borat's bigoted views. By the way, I found it very curious that the dinner party guests did not want to end the evening until Borat's African-American date arrived; but everything else he did before that was acceptable? Kind of sad and shocking and really says a lot...<br /><br />A lot of the scenes must have been scripted, staged, and rehearsed otherwise the movie never could have been made. But it was still funny to see Borat when he tried to "marry" Pam Anderson. I am shocked that it only got an R rating. It should at least be rated NC-17; I hate to imagine what was cut out to keep the R rating?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The best Hannibal film 9.5/10"></head><body><p>Now we are at my favorite & considered by many to be the best of the Hannibal series Silence Of The Lambs released in 1991 big hit I know it got a lot of awards. This is 1 of those movies that I can agree with the critics on. Directed by Jonathon Demme who directed The Manchurian Canidate remake a few other he's directed a lot of documenteries but hasn't directed a lot that I know of & that is a shame cause has the knack for directing. It stars Anthony Hopkins as Dr Hannibal Lecter, Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford, Ted Levine as Jame Gumb AKA "Bufflo Bill" & Brooke Smith as Catherine Martin. Based off the Thomas Harris book. Story is FBI trainee Clarice Starling has been chosen by Director Jack Crawford to send some kind of Questionaire to Dr Hannibal Lecter it relates to finding "Bufflo Bill" a serial killer that remains at large so they will use Lecter just as they did in Manhunter & it will be more difficult for her seeing that she is a trainee the guy in the last movie was a veteran agent. Catherine Martin a girl who is going home sees this guy trying to get a couch into his van & he uses it to trick his victim knock her out. Crawford & Starling piece more of the puzzle together during an autopsy when they find a Death Head Moth in a the throat. They figure out he keeps the victim alive for 3 days. So Clarice lies to Dr Lecter about a transfer if she can save Catherine Martin she is the daughter of TN Senator Ruth Martin also Dr Chilton listens to the conversation there will be a transfer but to TN. There is a scene where we find out about Clarice's childhood which I guess is why it's called Silence Of The Lambs. Lecter eventually escapes his cell cause the prison he was transferred to is minimum security 1 he beets2 guards to death which 1 is played by Charles Naiper bad guy from 1st Blood Part II I love some Charles Naiper pwnage. LOL! Clarice pieces together the clues Lecter gave her it all leads to a man named Jame Gumb & she finds out he's trying to make a woman's suit which is weird & odd. We also get the Good Bye Horses scene which was kind of disgusting. Clarice goes to the house where Jame Gumb lives under an assumed name & she realizes that she's got him but he runs off goes to the basement cuts the power Gumb has Clarice in his sights using night vision goggles just as he gets his gun out Clarice turns around & shoots him dead. Catherine is safe during her graduation party she gets a phone call from Dr Lecter he tells her I won't be on long so you can't track it he say "I'm having an old friend for dinner." He followed Dr Chilton to the Bahamas which means he was Hannibal's next meal. Ok if I spoiled it don't get mad cause this movies has been out for 20 years which today is the annaversery. I have the Blu Ray which it the transfer is great. It has commentary Breaking The Silence. It has a featurette. I have seen all the deleted scenes which a couple should've stayed in there is a version where they added all the deleted scenes back in. Dino DeLaurntiis passed on producing cause of the failure of Manhunter he gave the rights to Orion. Brooke Smith gained 25 pounds for the role of Catherine Martin. The evnets do occur a few years after Manhunter but it ignors it & it's a loose sequel more of it's own movie. The filmakers were going to shoot a flashback scene when Clarice was talking about her runaway attempt but Jonathon Demme thought mentoning it worked just as well. The film originally was suppose to be released in October of 90. Jonathon Demme originally wanted Michelle Phiffer for the role of Clarice but she thought the movie was too violent. Some of the early drafts had the names changed for legal reasons. Michale Keaton Mickey Rourke were considered for the role of Jack Crawford. Christopher Lloyd Patrick Stewart Louis Gosssette Jr Jack Nickolson John Hurt & Robert De Niro were all considered for the role of Hannibal. Jonathon Demme said that there were 300 applicants for the role of Clarice. This was the only horror film to win an Oscar. Jonathon Demme did a great job. Anthony Hopkins was awesome. Jodie Foster was good. Ted Levine really studied this character. Scott Glenn was good. Brooke Smith didn't annoy me I cared about her character. So if you see this purchase & it is on TV quite a lot you can get  it cheap.</p></body></html>

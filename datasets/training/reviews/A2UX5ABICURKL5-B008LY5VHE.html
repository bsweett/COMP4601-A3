<meta name="summary" content="A new exiperance in swimming in the ocean!!"></head><body><p>I was 3 years old when this movie came out.<br />I remember goin to see Jaws 2 with my Dad & my brother.<br />I had the hardest time just swimming in our pool in our<br />back yard for about a year after seeing Jaws 2.<br />Ever since seeing Jaws I've had a interest in sharks.<br />I would say Jaws 1 & 2 are the best out of the series,<br />3 & 4 are kinda corny & stupid.<br />I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="You will never look at hooks the same way...."></head><body><p>This is one of the more fiendishly original ideas ever put on screen. A simple gold puzzle-box, correctly solved, opens up the "pleasures of heaven or hell" to those who seek the ultimate in experience. Of course, we never see the pleasures of heaven -- this is a horror movie, not a porno flick -- but the pleasures of hell are delivered by four latex-and-leather nightmares called Cenobites: highly stylized humanoid demons who inflict the most awful tortures imaginable on those who summon them. In this case, however, one of their former victims, the debauched, thrill-seeking Frank Cotton (creepy Sean Chapman) manages to escape from hell when some of his brother Larry(veteran actor Andrew Robinson)'s blood accidently re-animates what is left of his corpse (which is not much). Frank recruits Larry's deceiving wife Julia (a very, very creepy Claire Higgins) to seduce and murder some hapless businessmen so he can feed on their blood to restore himself, but eventually he will need a suit of skin to walk around in -- and his brother's is a perfect fit. Opposing them is the fiesty Kirsty (Ashley Lawrence, typical horror-movie actress -- shreiking and running), Larry's devoted daughter, who ends up making a devil's bargain with the Cenobites in an attempt to save her father's life. "Hellraiser" is a gritty, nasty, ugly film, with more gore and blood-splattering than you can shake a mop at and very few redeeming characters, and it is more gory and disturbing (the Cenobites calm, clinical thirst for torture is somehow much worse than the chainsaw-waving of Leatherface or the the silent-stalkings of Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees) than it is scary, but the concept is so original, and so jarring to see, that you will never be completely free of it. Unfortunately, Cliver Barker's subsequent directorial outings, like "Nightbreed" and "Lord of Illusions" were so bad that this film, which he says is his least favorite outing, comes off as more of a fluke than the beginning of something grand. But "Hellraiser" stands fine on its own.</p></body></html>

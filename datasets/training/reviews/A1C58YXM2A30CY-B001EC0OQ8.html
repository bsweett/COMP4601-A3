<meta name="summary" content="The First Film Noir - Bogie's Best! [VHS VERSION]"></head><body><p>I got to rewatch this as I was reviewing my VHS collection.  From MGM/UA comes the VHS version in "glorious black and white."  The cassette plays the original film as-is, with no clean-up, complete with little crackles and dust motes, etc.<br /><br />Bogart plays Sam Spade, one of his best roles that nearly typecast him as the hard-boiled film noir private detective.  San Francisco 1941, complete with Bay Bridge and Bush & Stockton Streets.  At that fateful corner, Sam's partner Archer bites it.  But he never pulled a gun and his coat is buttoned.  Did he know the killer?<br /><br />And who is the mysterious woman who is a pathological liar and overacts to Sam?  Sam sees right through her ("you're good -- now you gonna walk around and start straightening everything out in the room?").  She's in over her head.<br /><br />Peter Lorre plays the slimy Turk who insists on searching Spade's office even after Sam punches him out for pulling a gun on him.  What nerve!<br /><br />Sydney Greenstreet is the rich businessman who in oh so smooth and suave way, takes Spade at his word and seemingly takes him into his confidence -- until a Mickey in the drink changes Sam's mind.<br /><br />Wilmer is an interesting character, makes like a gangster and could be the fall guy for the gang's murderous ways.<br /><br />As a detective story, the plot moves steadily if a bit slowly towards its completion.  I already knew who the killer was, having watched this a few times already, so I get more and more impressed with the style of 40s filmmaking whenever I watch it.  Mary Astor is the strange lady with strange purpose.<br /><br />Looks like the director was trying to work in the Archer's wife who was in love with Spade thing, but they let that drop, the only real plot hole in the whole affair.<br /><br />Overall, great film that would set up Bogart for life.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

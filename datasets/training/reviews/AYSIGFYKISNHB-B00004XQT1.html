<meta name="summary" content="Killer Movie"></head><body><p>I saw this film back when it first came out and I wasn't just amazed with this film, I was amazed with Christian Bale. Good thing they didn't get Leonardo Dicaprio to play Bateman. As much as a good actor Dicaprio is, he doesn't fit into Bateman's shoes.<br /><br />This movie isn't as gory as the book, but the performances by everyone in this film makes this film a killer. Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a New York City yuppy who has money, hangs out with his friends at clubs and dinner, has a sweet girlfriend {Witherspoon}, and has a nice apt. But, there's something about him his friends don't know, he's a murderer.<br /><br />But, things don't go too well after he kills Paul Allen {Leto}, a detective Kimble {Dafoe} is now questioning him on Allen's disappearance.<br /><br />This uncut version doesn't have extra gore, just a longer scene of him having sex with 2 lovely ladies. This DVD does have cool features, but I wish a new interview with Christian Bale was on it. I guess he was too busy filming Batman Begins.<br /><br />American Psycho is a must-have for all fans of the book and film fans all around.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="LIKED THE MOVIE,BUT NOT THE DVD RELEASE!!!"></head><body><p>2 stars is for DVD,NOT the movie!<br /><br />I love Michael bay Movies and he comes to action he ROCKS...I liked this movie MUCH; MUCH better an that stupid "STEATH". Was almost came out after each other in theaters and that was stupid too,I think thats why none of them made any money in box office!. I was really looking to buy this DVD for my collection when comes out. But this is not Michael bay DVD release!.. His poplar of double disks or extended cut movies and loaded DVDS..Definitely not this DVD version!!. I KNOW for sure like the rest of them, he going to come out with another version this DVD with extras and extended cuts and loaded stuffs with DTS audio, in near soon. If u look at hes PASS DVD releases u would know ...SO if u DVD collector like I am , just wait and get the real thing later on. Just skip this one ,just rent it if u want to real see it! Great action pack..Liked it a lot! A</p></body></html>

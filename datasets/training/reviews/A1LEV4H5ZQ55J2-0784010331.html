However, a population of rebelliousness mutants threaten to overthrow the ruling administrator.<br /><br />The plot centers around an earth-man called Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who seems to be unhappy with his wife (Sharon Stone) and for no reason other than some urge to go to Mars. He goes to Total Rekall, a business specializing in memory enhancements and takes the trip to Mars as a secret agent.<br /><br />The many sub plots twist and turn but Quaid eventually discovers his real identity.<br /><br />This is a good action movie with good graphics and screenplay.</p></body></html>

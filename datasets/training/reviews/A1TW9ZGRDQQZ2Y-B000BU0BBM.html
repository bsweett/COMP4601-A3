Out of the all the movies of his I have seen, The Brothers Grimm is the closest thing to a hollywood film Gilliam has made in my opinion. I heard a lot of scenes were cut out due to the studio pressure, so there will likely be a Director's Cut which should help the film flow together a little better. The acting is very good from Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as the brothers, but once again Peter Stormare steals the show with his zany officer of torture. The film is visually a beautiful sight, filled with lush landscapes and an enchanted forrest. I liked how many Grimm fairytales were woven into this magical world (Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, etc.) and the CGI wasn't overdone. Overall, The Brothers Grimm is a worthy film in Terry Gilliam's uniquely brilliant library.</p></body></html>

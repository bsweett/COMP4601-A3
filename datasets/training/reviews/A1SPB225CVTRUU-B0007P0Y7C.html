<meta name="summary" content="Better than Daredevil."></head><body><p>Even though Elektra had died in Daredevil already, but here she is revived by the wise and powerful Stick, a martial arts specialist played by Terance Stamp. He also trained her to become a more powerful fighter, and she was stronger and better by the time she headed out on her own again. Jennifer Gardner is impressive, and it's obvious that she's done a lot of training for the title role this time.<br /><br />Elecktra is haunted by traumatic past events and she's depressed and isolated. She came across a Abby, a teenaged girl and her dad in an remote island where she lived. Abby is the "treasure" meaning she's a martial arts protegee, and is being pursued by The Hand, a group of powerful evil people with special black-magics. Stick and his team is also secretly trying to protect and take the girl in for training. While protecting the girl, Elecktra had no idea of her identity until much later when the girl started to fight the villians.<br /><br />The first half of this film is rather slow, and had very little fight scenes. The good battles are concentrated in the second  half, which had some good special effects. The villians all took their even share of screentime and fight scenes, and Elektra took on them on a at time. Terance Stamp is vastly underused in this movie, he didn't even have to do any fight scenes. Goran Visnjic(The Deep End) played Abby's father, and had love scenes with Elektra. His role was unfortunately underwritten and irrelevant to the story that he's best effort was not even working here.<br /><br />Even though Ben Affleck didn't make an appearance in the film, but he did have a deleted scene in the special feature.</p></body></html>

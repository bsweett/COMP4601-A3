<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's Last Bow"></head><body><p>Stanely Kubrick was a brillant film director of ideas who composed some of the most philosophically and intellectually challanging movies of the last 45 years. Kubrick helped augment the way movies expressed themselves by  showing that motion pictures had the ability to convincingly convey complex  moral and philosophical issues by the forum of the moving image. Kubrick's  final film, Eyes Wide Shut, deals with the interdependant relationship  between romantic fullfillment and individual emotional identity. Both  function within the minds of the adults that inhabit Eyes Wide Shut's  world. Yet every major character in the film from Cruise and Kidman's  characters to Pollack's millionare to the female prositutes connect their  lack of sexual satisifaction to their failed conceptions of their own  lives. Everyone in this film attempt activities that might act like a  catalyst and break them free of their devalued state of mind, yet the  initial act just proliferates into a pattern and a downward spiral of  misunderstanding. The hidden society that is at the heart of this film,  deals primarily with the depths those will go to find self-worth and  satisfaction in their lives. Others dream of elusive possibilities that  might have ruined their lives but plague their fantasies. Sexual dreams,  acts, and fanatsies are the irrational kinetic tangent that lures these  characters into the bowels of insanity and beyond. Eyes Wide Shut is very  mature voyage into humanity's base instincts. It has one of the few  sexually mature and insightful naratives in the motion picture history.  Though flawed by some aspects, Kubrick last film still shows he knew  humanity till the end.I will definitely buy the EWS DVD edtion when it  comes out.</p></body></html>

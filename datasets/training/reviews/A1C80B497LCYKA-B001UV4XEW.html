<meta name="summary" content="MOVIE DOESN'T ADD MUCH TO PREVIEW"></head><body><p>The Hangover has a great premise - waking up the morning after with all kinds of evidence as to what happened the night before, but no memory - which the trailers capitalized on. But what's in the trailers is about all there is in the film. It's a great premise, but it fails to deliver, so we end up with one very predictable, very dumb movie. Which is why it's so popular. Basically, the film validates irresponsible behavior as long as you can prove that you were high. Two things I can say that are good about this film: that is one cute baby; and Bradley Cooper is a cut above the rest of the cast. Rated R for sex, drugs and language.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></body></html>

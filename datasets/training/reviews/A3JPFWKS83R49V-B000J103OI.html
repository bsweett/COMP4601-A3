<meta name="summary" content="The Fashion Business Does Take its Toll"></head><body><p>Based on Lauren Weisenberg's book from 2003, The Devil Wears Prada is a fairly good film that follows a naive young woman on her journey from a small town to New York City where she gets hired to work for a popular fashion magazine. This movie is one of a handful of films directed by David Frankel- a man best known for his directorial involvement in various television series and in a few films.<br /><br />The Devil Wears Prada has many of the cliches one would expect in a film that follows an unoriginal plot but it also offers some interesting twists and some excellent performances. The story of a naive small town girl who moves to New York in search of a big career is an old theme for a movie but Devil Wears Prada succeeds more often than it doesn't and it turns out to be an acceptable film.<br /><br />A large part of this movie is spent dealing with Meryl Streep's Miranda character; detailing her ruthless, uncaring persona as she verbally degrades her workers and has everyone around her walking on eggshells. I found myself enthralled with Streep more than anyone else in the film because once again, she excels in every possible way. Like always, Streep is excellent in this role and she is the main reason I recommend watching this movie. Her Miranda character is cold, insensitive, and arrogant, but not as completely obnoxious as she could be. Miranda never raises her voice and often expresses herself very effectively without saying a word. Streep deserves all the credit for making this character so enjoyable to watch and she, alone, makes the movie worth viewing.<br /><br />All of the other performers are very good in this film, including Anne Hathaway in the lead role, Stanley Tucci, Emily Blunt, and others. It was interesting to watch Hathaway's character as she stumbles into this job with a fashion magazine, hoping to use it as a stepping stone to a career in journalism. She changes many things about herself simply to please those around her in the business and ultimately sacrifices much of her personal life. This is the type of situation I cannot personally relate to, but I can think of several individuals who have walked down this same treacherous road, expecting great things in the professional sense but giving up their own personal identity in the process.<br /><br />Where Devil Wears Prada falls short is with the screenplay and the lack of deeper examination of the fashion and publishing industries. A great motion picture could be made about a subject like this but David Frankel decides to keep Devil Wears Prada on the simple side. The movie does a good job with its cross examination of that sensitive area where personal lives and business lives cross each other but it doesn't go far enough to be considered a classic film.<br /><br />Overall, Devil Wears Prada is a good movie with some funny moments but mostly a serious message about work and play. The movie reminds me in some ways of the hit series Sex in the City (David Frankel directed some of the Sex in the City shows) and it succeeds mostly because of the performances- especially that of Hollywood veteran Meryl Streep. Take Meryl Streep out of this picture and you would have another second- rate run of the mill movie destined for ever growing Hollywood bin of mediocrity. But with Streep performing so well and the rest of the cast contributing very good performances as well, Devil Wears Prada turns out to be a good enough film to recommend.</p></body></html>

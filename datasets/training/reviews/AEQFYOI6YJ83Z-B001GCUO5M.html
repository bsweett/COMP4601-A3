<meta name="summary" content="An absolutely spectacular modern noir film."></head><body><p>Sometimes, schlock borders on art.  In the hands of Martin Scorsese, it not only becomes art--it becomes a whole new kind of art entirely.  SHUTTER ISLAND is equal parts thriller, noir, mystery, and horror, a darkly humorous and atmospheric film filled some outstanding acting and truly stunning visuals.<br /><br />The film revolves around a very simple premise: U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his partner (Ruffalo) are going to Ashecliffe Island on Shutter Island, outside Boston, to look for a missing inmate.  She hasn't escaped: she's on the island somewhere.  But where?  And what exactly goes on at Ashecliffe, what mysterious activities have really drawn Daniels there?  And the ultimate question: will he escape with his sanity?<br /><br />The film is very closely based on Dennis Lehane's spectacular novel, with a few minor twists (and one not-so-minor twist near the end).  DiCaprio is a wonder in the lead role; he has really grown into his own as an actor, and this film gives him a breadth of range he hasn't yet seen before.  As for the rest of the principle cast: Ruffalo is in traditionally fine form; it's nice to see Ben Kingsly actually acting again (as opposed to just treading water in a bunch of slop); Michelle Williams is amazing as Daniels's deceased wife (viewed in flashbacks/hallucinations); Max von Sydow is chilling (if underused); Emily Mortimer turns in a haunting performance in her limited role; John Carroll Lynch doesn't have much to do, but does it well; and Jackie Earl Healey, in his small role, is fantastic.<br /><br />The level of the performances, and the solid script by Laeta Kalogridis, aside, the reason to view this film--repeatedly--is for Scorsese's atmospheric directing.  Remember CAPE FEAR, his slight misfire of a horror film (though still far better than most horror films of the 90s)?  SHUTTER ISLAND doesn't misfire, not once.  And it's filled with some absolutely stellar visual shots, scenes and imagery that borders on performance art.  Haunting in its breadth and emotional resonance, SHUTTER ISLAND ranks among Scorsese's best.  Watch it to see what a noir/horror film should be.</p></body></html>

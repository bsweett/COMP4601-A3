<meta name="summary" content="An intelligent, entertaining film."></head><body><p>The Good Shepherd has a quiet intelligence about it, making subtle and interesting points about the human condition -- about trust, sexuality, intimacy, and rationalization. To be sure, it has it's flaws. It's a bit on the long side -- it could lose half an hour and be a better film for it. Although Matt Damon's performance is unusually understated and his character only marginally sympathetic, it's a riveting turn nonetheless. He's one of those smart, quiet "clerks" whose emotions lie buried and whose ruthless intelligence makes him capable of just about everything except meaningful human relationships.</p></body></html>

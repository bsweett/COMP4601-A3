To make some extra money, he takes a job as a filing clerk. One day at work, he accidentally stumbles onto a door, that is really a portal into the brain of John Malkovich. For fifteen minutes, he sees, hears, and experiences everything that Malkovich does. Then he is dumped onto the New Jersey turnpike. Together with his beautiful co-worker Maxine ( Catherine Keener), and pet-obsessed wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz), they come up with a way to make &quot;Being John Malovich&quot; a profitable one, by charging 200 bucks a trip. The only problem, is that Malkovich starts to learn about what's going on... <p>&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is one of the funniest and most original films I have ever seen in my life. The script is amazing with its combination of puppetry, infidelity, and out of body experiences. The love triangle between Keener, Diaz, and Cusak is extremely well done, and fun to watch. It is also extremely funny, because they are only attracted to each other when they are inside Malkovich. The three really offer top notch performances. However, the best performance of all was given by the man himself John Malkovich. John is extremely funny in the role, and gives an accurate portrayal of what one would go through in his situation. Watching him as a puppeteer,will have you in tears from laughing so hard. The camera work on this film is outstanding. The film is actually shot at times, from the inside of John's head, looking out. <p>This extremely funny, and bizare film is truly one of the best films that I have seen in the last couple of years. The plot is extremely interesting and creative, the acting is perfect all the way around, and the camera work is amazing. The DVD is outstanding and offers an interview with director Spike Jonze, a look at the art of puppeteering, and a lot more. Definately a must own for anyone's DVD collection.</p></body></html>

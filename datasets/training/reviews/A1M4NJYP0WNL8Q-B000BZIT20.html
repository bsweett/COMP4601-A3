It has spawned so many imitations that newcomers may feel that it is a bit commonplace.  But, at the time, it literally created a new genre.  Alien still sets the bar where science fiction meets both suspense and splatter.  It's easy to be hockey, but Ridley Scott proved that in the chambers of a spaceship, there is no escape.<br /><br />When the crew of the Nostromo answers a mysterious beacon, they find and ancient spaceship, the ruined body of its pilot, and a cluster of eggs.  One of these attacks a crewmember and succeeds in implanting a nearly unkillable embryo in its victim.  The crew returns to the Nostromo, the alien tears its way out of its victim's body and, in the dark of space, humans become the prey in a deadly hunt.  Sigourney Weaver, as Lt. Ripley, sees crew members die and disappear around her as finds that there is more to this than an inadvertent run in with a bad alien and the discovery drives her to desperate action.<br /><br />I don't think I will ever forget the alien's debut as a bloody jack-in-the-human-box.  It still is a jarring moment, as Kane (John Hurt) becomes the first in a string of grim deaths.  Ash's (Ian Holm) confrontation with Ripley is another memorable scene, and the final sequence is outstanding.  Needless to say, I also was impressed by Ripley's bikini underwear but that has little to do with the plot.<br /><br />In watching the film this time I finally realized that the fatal flaw that creates the nightmare isn't the deadly creature or a secret plot, but everyone's failure to realize that the Alien was not a simple monster, but a deadly and intelligent artifact of war.  This message is as timely today as it was in 1979.  Failing to respect your opposition is a fatal mistake.<br /><br />For all purposes this was Sigourney Weaver's debut (does anyone remember her bit part in Woody Allen's Annie Hall?).  Managing to convey a strong personality and overwhelming terror is no simple task and Weaver manages to create a believable personality in an unbelievable situation.  Yaphet Kotto also does an excellent job, and nearly steals some scenes from Weaver.  All of the acting is well orchestrated and focused.  It is this, not the creepy monster and the spooky sets, it what makes Alien work.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="NOT SURE DA VINCI WOULD HAVE WANTED HIS NAME ON THIS"></head><body><p>Of course, everyone bought this book or purchased the audio cd..it's umbiquitous, but it is good..as for the movie..well..it's ok..let's face it this is a convuluted story the moves at break neck pace so Howard had a tough project.  The locations are fantastic and the cinematography is amazing, as for the acting..well..i love Hanks..but he was not very good in this film, Im not sure why, he just seemed ill at ease ease with this character, from his beginning lecturing scene until the end he is just off tone, he is like an ernest guide, tudoring us on criptology, and explaining the obvious and the not so obvious like an old tenured professor at university that has long since bored with the material and he has very little chemistry with the woman playing Neuvo, not sure why that is..the pace of the film is fine..the movie is long..but it does not drag much, Paul Belemy and Ian McKellen come off best, Reno comes off the worst, he is really quite bad, not sure why that is either, maybe he needs a course in english as a second language, whatever.  Overall, I recommend this dvd, especially if you have read the book..i read the book last year..and i did not see this at the theater because everyone said it ruined the book...after seeing it on DVD, i dont agree, I wish i had seen it on the big screen, it probably would have been better, anyway the DVD has some nice extra's about the characters and some deleted scenes..enjoy....</p></body></html>

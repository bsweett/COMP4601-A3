<meta name="summary" content="Drop your socks & grab your Crocs...IRON MAN vs. WAR MACHINE nuff said!"></head><body><p>It is inevitable to compare the sequel to it's 2008 original, and the first IRON MAN was great, fanboy status aside I recommended it to everyone....I would make the same recommendation for IM2, across the board.... But if you are a fanboy, you already know this because you went to the midnight show!<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr.  was talked about connected with the role long before it became a fact, so he is still dream casting for the role of Tony Stark, and he still exceeds expectations as the Industrialist, this time facing certain death due to his HEARTcondition. Tony overindulges in the Celebrity, parties and booze as he embraces while searching for a cure and trying to find himself, too . This is a classic IM storyline from the comics, as is his confrontation with WhipLash a.K.a Ivan Venko a.k.a. Mickey Rourke, out to reclaim his family right to the Stark Legacy. Meanwhile,  the government and wacky , rival weapons-manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) are pressuring Tony to turn the IRON MAN tech over to the government. Once flippantly reassuring the Senate committee that he has things under control, Venko appears and all hell busts loose. Stark's best bud Col 'Rhodey' Rhodes (played this time Don Cheadle)is out to help Tony back on track while struggling with his own duties and responsibilities to protect the Country.<br /><br />The story is a little crowed with Whiplash working on his revenge, Rhodey overcoming his personal obstacles and Tony's, the slinky agent Black widow infiltrating Stark Industries while Tony's unrequited love Pepper Potts (Paltrow) takes over the Company while it appears that holding on to the IM tech was a mistake, once an armored super villain appears, and later a haywire drone army. Although, I would question the point of Scarlett Johansson's character , but for the super-spy cat suit fight sequence along with director Jon Favreau, which causes me to preemptively retract said statement and enjoy the spandex and party dresses. And Venko's backstory is thankfully short , as is the movie get to the action, from the Opening scene the film is high energy and beautiful graphics.... everything  from the dancing EXPO  girls...the Iron Man-ites, to  the fight between IRON MAN and War Machine (for non-geeks War Machine is the armor Rhodes wears during his time as IRON MAN in the comics, seen in IM1). In fact the fight between Tony and Rhodes at the party to a mix-music is worth admission!!!<br /><br />Cheadle as Rhodey was a good swap the great chemistry between him and RDJr., RDJr. and Paltrow still great. Robert Downey Jr. slips right back ...I'm reminded by IM2 why I was a such a hugh Rourke fan even thru the STUPId Yrs...he does soooo much with soooo little, count Rourke's lines, most  in Russian and tell me it ain't an amazing performance, the presences...(while you are at it look up Angel Heart and Prayer for the Dying, 2 great Mickey Rourke movies). Watch for an homage or two to other AVENGERS characters as the Marvel movies move grow ever nearer to those future releases.... Next stop Thor:The Movie....<br /><br />Again,  War Machine vs. Iron Man in the same film is worth admission.... War Machine teamed with Iron Man for show down, bonus<br />stayed after the credits...I advise you to stay....upshot on the film....it rocked don't let some Chicago Tribune reviewer tell ya different, (Tribune gave an uncalled for 2 1/2 ) like the first film, fanboyness aside, it was GOOD!</p></body></html>

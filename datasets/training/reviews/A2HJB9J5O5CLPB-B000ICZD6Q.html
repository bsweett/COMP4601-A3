<meta name="summary" content="Topher is New Tom Hanks"></head><body><p>Topher Grace is the finest young actor in film.  Yeah, he's better than DiCaprio and all the other young pretenders.  Anyone who hasn't caught his fresh-face boyish looks in P.S. has missed a gem of wry comedy.  In Good Company, we get more of the same.  Movie stars have a shtick and Topher takes over where Tom Hanks left off, but with a difference, Topher is manlier in his sentimentality.  When he hugs Dennis Quaid at the end of the film, he does so as a young man that has learned a tough lesson, a man that has matured.  I love Tom Hanks, but there's always a hanky ready, it's expected.<br /><br />The other great thing about In Good Company, it's a film for adults about business.  Sure, corporations buy each other, spin off a department, shuttle their employees about, provide benefits like healthcare, education, life insurance, and a decent salary. They also fire workers for all kinds of unintelligible reasons.  Personally, I love corporations and I don't care what out-of-touch Hollywood Liberals think. The folks that work at corporations are no better or worse than in most microcosms.  Maybe academics and film actors are perfect in their love for humanity, but corporate man (Dennis Quaid)is concerned with paying his mortgage, sending the daughter (Scarlett Johansson) to college, and doing a good job, an ethical job at work.<br /><br />Young hotshot Grace causes mayhem when he becomes boss to the much older Quaid, and more mayhem when he beds Quaid's athletic daughter.  None of these events happens because Grace is a bad person; he's a corporate workaholic that has succeeded right out of college beyond his wildest dreams but without a family life and without a tender wife.  In fact, Grace is alone with his Porsche.  Quaid's family looks like the Garden of Eden to our glib executive.<br /><br />Will Topher Grace find freedom from frivolous "pseudo-religious corporate think," and can Quaid save his job, coming to terms with his middle-age crisis.  Watch this delightful film to find out.</p></body></html>

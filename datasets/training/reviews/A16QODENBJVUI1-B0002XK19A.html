<meta name="summary" content="A film that completely transcends the superhero genre"></head><body><p>As a rule, superhero movies are a rather lackluster genre.  The emphasis is almost always on a bankable star, flashy special effects, and elaborate confrontations with super villains.  SPIDERMAN 2 lacks none of these things, but luckily it has a great deal more going for it.  More than anything else, SPIDERMAN 2 has a great story.  Somewhere along the line, the other superhero movies lost track of the story; this superb film brings that back.<br /><br />I do not think that it is any exaggeration to say that this is the finest superhero movie ever made, and the primary reason for that is the super screenplay.  Film mastermind Sam Raimi obviously recognized that while special effects and stars are great enhancements to a film, at root you have to have a story worth the telling.  He therefore recruited Pulitzer Prize winning novelist Michael Chabon (whose novel THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY proved that he possessed an absolute mastery over comic book type stories) to provide the basic story around which the screenplay was written.  I found the first film to be mildly interesting, but the vast improvement in the second film over the first is overwhelmingly because of the greatly improved storyline.<br /><br />Without giving away any major plot details, the situation is this:  in most superhero movies, despite whatever attempts are made at depicting the situation of the central character as tragic, we actually envy them.  What male wouldn't love to be Superman?  Who wouldn't want super strength, the ability to fly, or invulnerability?  Batman may lack these, but Bruce Wayne is a multi-billionaire with whom most of us would trade places in a second.  And while Bruce broods a lot, it is very difficult to feel that he truly has a rotten life.  The brilliance of SPIDERMAN 2 lies in the fact that an hour into the movie, it is impossible to imagine anyone wanting to trade places with Peter Parker.  Yeah, he is a superhero, but his life really and truly sucks, and in super fashion.  He has a horrible job, is struggling in school, discoveries that his aunt is being evicted from her house, lives in an absolutely wretched apartment (with a dreadful landlord, magnificently played by Russian comic Elya Baskin), and is feeling very, very lonely.  But worst of all, MJ, the love of his life, has not only gotten engaged in the face of Peter's reluctance to get involved with her, but is furious at Peter for his ongoing unreliability.  As he feels himself losing her presence in his life, he actually begins losing his powers.  And all this takes place as he has to face a new and dangerous enemy in Doc Ock, a brilliant scientist whose body and mind has been taken over by intelligent high-tech tentacles (played marvelously by superb character actor Alfred Molina).<br /><br />Luckily, the film excels not only in setting up the situation, but does an excellent job of resolving the central concepts in the storyline.  Peter recovers his passion for MJ and thereby his superpowers (the precise instance that he once again has his powers is the moment when MJ in a coffee shop asks him to kiss her), recovers his sense of purpose, and in the end is rescued from some of his loneliness.<br /><br />After SPIDERMAN, I was not especially looking forward to SPIDERMAN 2, but after this one, and especially after learning that Raimi has asked Michael Chabon to write another story, I am eagerly awaiting the next one.  Early rumor is that James Franco as Harry Osborn will resurrect his father?s Green Hornet, and that the Black Cat (perhaps played by Eliza Dushku, who is reportedly favored for the role by Raimi) will make an appearance.</p></body></html>

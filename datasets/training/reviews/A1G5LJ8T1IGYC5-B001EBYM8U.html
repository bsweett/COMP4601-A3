<meta name="summary" content="THE BEST MOVIE FROM 2001, PERIOD"></head><body><p>FIRST DAY ON THE JOB, A ROOKIE COP [ETHAN HAWKES] IS INTRODUCED TO A CORRUPT COP [DENZEL WASHINGTON] WHO WILL BE HIS PARTNER. VERY GRIPPING, AND IT EVEN HAS ENOUGH GOOD TWISTS AND MORE THAN ENOUGH GOOD ACTING TO HOLD ONE'S INTEREST. THIS DEFINITELY AIN'T YOUR AVERAGE COP MOVIE, SO DON'T EXPECT A ''LETHAL WEAPON''-TYPE MOVIE HERE. ALL FANS OF DENZEL WASHINGTON MUST GET THIS MOVIE NOW! DENZEL WASHINGTON WON A WELL-DESERVED BEST ACTOR OSCAR FOR HIS PERFORMANCE IN THIS MOVIE.</p></body></html>

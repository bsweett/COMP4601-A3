<meta name="summary" content="THE LONGEST DRAWN OUT SERIES EVER"></head><body><p>I may be giving this movie 4 stars, but this will not be a glowing review. HARRY POTTER has one story. Throughout the entire series, there has been one central theme: Boy learns magic and comes closer to his destiny to face off against evil. Did it take 8 movies to get there? Not to say that I didn't enjoy all of the movies, HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1, really hammers this point home for me as it ends dramatically and quite ceremoniously as if to say.... "Come back again folks. Thanks for your cash." This was just one more TEASER film building up to the payoff.<br /><br />I enjoy the HARRY POTTER movies. Don't get me wrong. Yet, it's like a bunch of movies centered around subplots building up to what is finally coming next in HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2. Resolution. Finale. I don't know if I want to say, "Thank God." or wish there were more movies coming. I think it's "Thank God."<br /><br />HARRY POTTER is the STAR WARS of this era, and I think they had more tact and circumstance then the STAR WARS series had, but both series made entire movies out of less than important story lines.<br /><br />DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is an okay movie in a series of good movies that are meandering and sometimes pointless but ultimately entertaining and good. PART 1 spends too much time being dramatic and world ending and hammering on the point that we should be afraid, very afraid. In doing so, it ultimately bores children who have been following the series to death and bores people like me who want the payoff to hurry up and get here for godsakes.<br /><br />DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2 better not disappoint because we've sat through 7 movies of subplot to get here... sheeesshh.</p></body></html>

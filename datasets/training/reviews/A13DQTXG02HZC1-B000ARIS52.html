For enthusiasts, they would have already known that Sin City is based upon comics done by Frank Miller and from excerpt provided in behind the scene, Frank himself didn't believe a movie need to be made as it's perfect as it is.  However, Robert Rodriquez had an idea that he couldn't resist.  Rather than conforming the comic to the movie format, he opts to turn it the other way around, made a movie that looked like a comic.  This movie is a testament of why I love movie at the first place.  It's an escapism, away from reality and for those two hours watching it, I literally was brought into the world of Sin City and totally captivated by all those characters (mainly strong men that had soft spots for fallen girls and who would be their protectors or their minders, to undo the wrongs or to make things right).  It's a movie that ought to be seen to be believed.  It's that good!  It would be one of those movies that would sit on well with Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill I and II.  Highly recommended.  This edition is thin on extras, only a behind the scene which is brief by any standard.  Get the extended one if you may.</p></body></html>

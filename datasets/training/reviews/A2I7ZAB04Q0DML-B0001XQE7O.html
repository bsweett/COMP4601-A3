<meta name="summary" content="A Film For Fathers and Sons"></head><body><p>At the beginning of this film, I must confess that I was skeptical as to whether or not I really wanted to invest much time into it.  It seemed to meander, providing a fantastic, satyrical &quot;Burtonesque&quot; view of a world of askewed reality.  It seemed to meander some...the premise, a boy and his father, fallen out from one another due to the son's embarrassment at his father incredible stories, are reunited when the son learns that the father is dying of cancer.<p>The balance of the movie is told in vignette flashbacks, jumping from the present day narrative to the many incredible stories of Edward Bloom, the &quot;Big Fish&quot; of the story, whose tales stretch credibility to its limits.  The film, which is so definitely Tim Burton, is also more.  Although I was slow to pick up on it at first, I came to realize that the film was, in fact, a reflection on the complex relationships between fathers and sons.  It touches on the believable infallability we all have for our fathers as children, and the &quot;fall from grace&quot; of our fathers when we discover they are as human as we are.<p>Though the story provides plenty of whimsy, and at times, plays more like an episode of &quot;Amazing stories&quot; than anything else, at its core is a powerful story about relationships.  This is a bit of a departure from the standard Burton fare, whose narrative stories are generally pure fantasy, without a thread of realism to them...such examples include &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; and even &quot;A Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;.  This story is more human than any of those, focusing not on the fantastic, but using the fantastic stories of a father whose life was incredible without the tall tales to explore the psyche of a man who never knew how to fail.<p>In the end, this film is a great tribute to fathers and sons everywhere, and is a film worth sharing. With the approach of Father's Day, this might make for a nice gift to share with Dad, and more, it is an entertaining romp through the fascinating world of Edward Bloom, Burton's newest slightly-askew-but-ever-so-human hero.  <p>-Scott Kolecki</p></body></html>

That is not the case here. There were a lot of things wrong with this movie.<br /><br />-Vince Vaughn looked way to old to be dating Jennifer anniston in this movie.<br /><br />-The one fight that sent the ball rolling on this little movie was so random it felt forced.<br /><br />-The Audeince feels no connection with the characters sometimes.<br /><br />-Several other characters are introduced and forgotten about qiuckly.<br /><br />-There are some funny parts but they are either really briefed or not planned well enough.<br /><br />I would have liked this movie way better if there were more Shanannigans and pranks being played out here. I mean, C'mon, the movie was long enough for it yet they only have like seven or eight "I got you back" ploys. Plus, jennifer plays a bit of a dry role here, which is why it's so hard to imagine them together or even liking each other. Plus, the ending was such a sure sign of a waste of movie money. Ended on such a down note.<br /><br />This is just my opinion here. I'm sure that a lot of people really liked this movie but I feel that it was underdone and overly long and drawn out.<br /><br />I mean, I like The War Of The Roses better than this. and that movie was a classic.<br /><br />I really can't understand how this movie made 107 million in the theater so far.</p></body></html>

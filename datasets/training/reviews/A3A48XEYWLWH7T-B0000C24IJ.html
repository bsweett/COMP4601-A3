As usual we get a group of good looking kids stranded on the back roads of West Virginia.  Why anyone would be in the back woods of West Virginia in the first place is beyond me, but at any rate they are soon met by the male protagonist, a budding med student.  Members of the party are soon dispatched by a trio of good ol' mountain boys.  You know the type, deformed after generations of inbreeding, super strong, tough to kill, wily, good hunters, non-discriminatory eaters.  The plot is pretty linear and straight forward for this type of film, but it delivers a decently taut experience.  Above average.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dracula or Clown? Whatever, It was a great movie"></head><body><p>I can call this a full CG movie. It was great. Visuals and CGs were not as brilliant as Lord of the Rings trilogy but very good indeed for a passable entertaining movie. Everything was allright except Count Dracula. In behind the scenes featurettes on disc two I found out Stephen Sommers and his crew's adorable and hard effort of making this movie and make it a good and memorable one. but the question is, why beyond all of that efforts, they ruined most of their job's impression by casting a wrong person as dracula? and funny is, in "Dracula featurette" on disc two they mentioned some brilliant nominees as Jeoffery Rush for this role! Just imagine if Jeoffery Rush had played in this movie as Dracula, How memorable this movie could've been? I could give this movie 5 stars if they'd used someone else instead of that clown!<br />Hugh Jackman and kate Beckinsale were the best matches for their rules. A good complex I can say! In CG and visuals, they did a great and really monumental job. but their consequence have not enough impression! some CGs are very sophisticated and look like real and some like Mr Hyde, Frankenstein Monster and Dracula monster at the end of movie are awful. I think they've used too much imagination thet they shouldn't!<br />anyway It's a "must have" DVD set for a CG movie collection or even an action movie collection. Special features are really good and useful in the Ultimate Collector's Edition. I've not seen such accurate featurettes on making a movie in any DVD set except Lord of the Rings Trilogy extended editions! but the price of this set is irrationally high! Approx 50 dollars for a 2 disc set? I don't know why. me myself have Asian Import of the Ultimate Collector's edition which is even better than US version. It has a great outer box. A double DVD case plus two Dual-layer dvds with a marvelous print that I've never seen in any US made DVD! All artworks are included plus a great real DTS audio track! It doesn't seem bootleg with all of that great features and I bought it 8.00 dollars! With all the respect, I think it's time for some US producers to reconsider their prices cause US release DVDs are not unique in quality anymore!</p></body></html>

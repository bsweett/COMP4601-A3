<meta name="summary" content="More of a drama than a fantasy, not a little kid's movie"></head><body><p>I've never read the book and based my purchase of the DVD based on the TV ads for the movie. I was expecting a lot of fantasy/ computer generated stuff but found the bulk of the movie to drag on in an almost boring manner. Two depressed, miserable children with few/ no friends who meet and become friends through their shared fantasy world- not much for the little ones in that outline is there?<br />The movie does have many interesting moments but there is very little that would be funny or entertaining for small children, and a little after church discussion that some would not want their children to hear.<br />I found the extras to be the best part of the DVD for me, including the bit with the author saying she supported the movie and her son being a producer- it must be fairly close to the original text of the book wth that then I guess.<br />I won't be watching this one often, but like another reviewer, I'd like to see what the two young stars do in the future.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's Dark and Disturbing but also likeable"></head><body><p>Let the Right One In is about a 12 yr old boy named Oskar who's tormented by bullies at school. A new girl moves in to his apartment building and appears to be the same age as him. They become friends and she gives him the courage to stand up to the bullies. He starts to fall for her and wants to go steady with her but he doesn't know that she's actually a vampire.<br /><br />  The movie is dark and twisted, yet their relationship is kind of sweet. Despite the film being creepy and haunting, it also manages to be likable due to the 2 young leads. The only thing that skeeved me out though, is that they didn't have to show the girl's private area in one scene. It may have just been a glimpse but it was still wrong. You know an American film wouldn't have gotten away with that.<br /><br />  Despite that though I would still recommend it to those who wish Twilight was less romantic, mushy and whimsical. Let the Right One In is kind of romantic but unlike Twilight, you get a good dose of old fashion horror. The direction has an old school feel to it and the film even has the look of a movie from the late 70's or early 80's.</p></body></html>

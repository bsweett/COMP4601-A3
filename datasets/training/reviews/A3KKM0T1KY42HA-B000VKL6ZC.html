<meta name="summary" content="The Michael Myers Story"></head><body><p>If you're looking for a re-do of John Carpenter's 1978 classic version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RIWAVW">Halloween</a>, you won't really get that with Rob Zombie's re-make. And to me that's a good thing; Zombie attempts to re-invent the Michael Myers character in his version versus basically doing over what was already done masterfully with the original.<br /><br />So what I suggest that you do is go into this movie with the above understanding. Because if you're a preservationist that doesn't want his classics messed with, then Zombie's adaptation will probably leave you angry and unsatisfied. I, on the other hand, was quite entertained by Zombie's Halloween. After all, a simple re-do that adds nothing new to what was already solidly in place would be pointless, right?<br /><br />Yes...I said "re-do" as opposed to "re-make". A re-make is when a director takes an old film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it different, and ideally, *better*. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original. Zombie may not have made a *better* movie than the original, but he sure did give the movie a unique spin.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is devoted to telling the Michael Myers story. The movie starts by showing Myers' at age 10 or 11. It's during this time that Zombie chronicles how Myers went from troubled to tormented to demented to completely psychopathic. The movie flash forwards 15 years through Myers incarceration and ultimate escape to wreak havoc on the infamous town of Haddonfield just like in the original.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is very well done to the point I was saying to myself that "this is a great movie." But then in the second half it collapses a bit with too many clich&eacute; horror movie "oh that would never really happen" moments. You know, like the police don't believe there's any danger and they're stupid; people venturing into places that you know they'd never go...especially on the heels of the warning that Myers could be in town; and the whole point of the first half of the movie seemed to attempt to show that Myers was human and just a psychopath, but that starts to go out the window in the second half as Myers starts showing a few immortal traits.<br /><br />But, like I said, I was entertained. The cast is pretty good, and the kid that played Myers at age 10 was outstanding. This re-make is definitely worth a watch for horror fans, but devoted fans of the original might want to take a pass.</p></body></html>

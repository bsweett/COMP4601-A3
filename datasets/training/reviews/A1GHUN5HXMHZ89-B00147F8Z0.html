In this movie, more than anything it detracts from what may have been at least a fair movie. Next, this should have been in the future with an off world colony, but once again present day humans are just meat on the slab for Aliens and Predators. My silly hope is that one of these will approach the game premise of the same name taking place in the future(Marines, Corporates, Predators, and Aliens fight in various future arena backdrops) or at least be more like Aliens 2 where at least the Marines got some payback on an off world colony. Here not a single human including the soldiers makes you respect them enough to think they could actually fight off a Predator or Alien. They spend most their time running from them. At least in Alien they trapped the humans on a ship and you truly felt fear. Here everyone is just impersonal so you don't feel any loss when the Aliens chow down or the Predator uses them for target practice. Perhaps in AVP 3 since at the end of this one they finally capture a Predator weapon. This movie is about a small town where a Predator that has been infested with an Alien crashes. Almost immediately we see a father and young son out hunting game become attacked and the Readers Digest version of infested. And so it goes for most of the town they are little more than casual considerations even if you find them slightly interesting. Add in that most of the scenes are so dark you can barely make anything out and you have a pretty forgettable movie.<br /><br />I of course bought this as I did all the Alien and Predator movies and the first AVP. Seriously not once did I feel the rush of fear or adrenalline I felt in the first Alien or first Predator. Even the sequels to those had alot more acting and action than this sad sequel to the first AVP. I have to say the first one was better where at least one woman and a Predator survived that was halfway likeable and all the scenes weren't so dark you couldn't see. I was rooting for the Predator "Scar". I really didn't care for the handful of human survivors in AVP 2, and the storyline was pretty weak. The military isn't called in till late, only to be part of the Alien Smorgasbord, and by then the hidden people in power are ready to nuke the town. I can't recommend this movie at all as anything but a rental if you have the slightest interest. Otherwise blow it off. If I had paid to see this in the theater I would have been ready to hurt someone for making me pay to see it. Poor quality DVD only because the director thought it was scary to shoot everything in the dark, no replayability. If you liked this then you probably will like another piece of trash movie that I can't even think of at the moment as this was so bad. In fact I doubt you have in fact seen all the other Alien and Predator movies. And don't try to tell me I don't know what I am talking about as I not only own all Alien and Predator movies, but I have been watching SciFi movies since the 1960s and have seen most that were made since "Melies the Magician".<br /><br />In fact I should have given this one star not two. At the very least you will notice the scenes  in the other movies are not so dark that you can't clearly make out the action. I highly recommend you go back and look at "Alien", "Aliens", "Predator", and "Predator 2" rather than wasting time on this one. If they had at least one truly visible fight between the Predalien and the Predator it would have redeemed itself but even that was so dark you couldn't see what weapon was used or who hit who. Seriously I don't want that battle in the rain on top a roof in the middle of the night without at least moonlight or some kind of light. Dark but visible is scary, but when you can't even make the figures out there is no scared, there is just wondering what was the director, camera person, and/or editor thinking. Add to this they kill each other, then are nuked along with all but a handful of townspeople that escape in a chopper and you have to ask why did I watch this exactly? I mention a good visible fight scene would have redeemed it but actually even some good acting might have. I guess with Sigourney Weaver, Lance Henriksen, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Danny Glover are a hard act to follow, but I would have been happy with any acting ability at all. As one reviewer astutely observed this is more brainless horror than Alien and Predator sequel. Please assure me none of the people involved with this movie will have anything to do with another sequel if there is one. So let me recap, extremely poor lighting, acting, story, directing, sound, music, and sets. If you felt this was good please once again see "Aliens" and "Predator" and pay attention to the lighting, acting, directing, story, sound, music, and sets and you will see how excellent they are when done right. People claiming this is scary can not imagine sitting in the theater watching a creature pop out of John Hurt's chest the first time. "Aliens" had an incredible effect on movies and movie goers and scared the bajeebers out of me. This has the feel of a B movie, and I have seen better. I wish John Carpenter had directed it, it would have rocked.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="plays like a parody of film noir"></head><body><p>You know what it's about: a movie based on a book that fictionalizes a true crime, in this case, the horrific Betty Short murder-mutilation case now known as "The Black Dahlia".  "Dahlia" is actually several different types of film rolled into one: a buddy-cop movie, period LA Noir flick and a based-on-a-true-story movie - all being types that Hollywood has tackled with decided ineptitude on their own, and now Hollywood has added another painful reminder of that failure.  (Only "LA Confidential" managed to rise above the pack, even as an imperfect masterpiece that easily outstrips "Dahlia".)<br /><br />The flick follows the "Dahlia" legend through the story of Blanchard (Eckhardt) and Bleichert (Hartnett), both ambitious but scandal-tinged LA cops of the immediate post-war City of Angels.  Sharing a love of boxing and Scarlett Johannsen, the two are only apparently two of a kind, but in reality represent polar opposites.  The unusually prescient media call them "Fire and Ice", and when the "Dahlia" story breaks, they are an odious DA's natural choice.  Instead, the case soon begins to break the two star cops, unhinging Blanchard and driving his wife into Bleichert's arms.  Bleichert himself begins to doubt the case is solvable and counsels his good friend to drop it, even as he continues to follow leads.  Instead of returning to his normal duties of pulling in dangerous felons at large, Bleichert pieces together threads that point to a rich Hollywood land developer, the underground pornography industry, and a rich bisexual heiress played by Hilary Swank.<br /><br />You know how you can sit through a bad movie and not realize how you've been taken until the credits roll?  I saw "Dahlia" last night, and even before that mid-movie haze wore off, I realized the painful botch I'd gotten myself into.  "Dahlia" probably appealed to its studio as one of those movies that makes no sense but looked like something that could survive on style, but the flick is short on style and long on nonsense.  Style-wise, DePalma looked to out-Noir "LA Confidential", but his touches just come off as a Noir parody, with all the expected gags: the hero cops are both morally suspect, and even Bleichert dangles the possibility that he might conceal evidence against Swank's character once the two of them hop in the sack; Swank's over-the-top performance as a spoiled and sexually ambiguous heiress is built around an impression of Katherine Hepburn (if Hepburn had played "The Philadelphia Story" with a potty-mouth, Swanks performance would have been dead-on); last-minute, implausible confessions will solve everything.<br /><br />The least believable thing about "The Black Dahlia" is that despite this being fiction (which would have given the script a free reign to shock us) and also that Brian DePalma is at the helm, this is an incredibly boring movie, lacking any suspense and short on surprises.  There is only a single sequence that does the legend justice - when Bleichert discovers the scene of the crime: the pacing and lighting are so perfectly paced that the story comes closest to realizing the dark dread that the rest of the story has been insulating us from.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Year Before Rick there Was Sam"></head><body><p>On AFI list of Greatest films of the 20th century is Humphrey Bogart's crime classic, The Maltese Falcon, Also Starring Casablanca's Syndey Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. The Story of Private Eye Sam Spade who cracks the murder case of his partner and discovers the statuette known as the Maltese Falcon. This Film is a perfect crime/mystery movie and a perfect Bogey film, Bogart lites up the screen screen, he may be greatest actor of the 20th century, he is on AFI's list. I recommend this for a crime film,a Bogart film and a great film in general.</p></body></html>

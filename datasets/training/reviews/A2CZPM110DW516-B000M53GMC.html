<meta name="summary" content="Bondmania begins"></head><body><p>According to Variety, the showbiz bible that tracks a film's box-office performance, the first James Bond film, "Dr. No," did well in the U.S. upon its belated 1963 release, but it was merely the 44th biggest grossing film of the year. "From Russia With Love" did better when issued in spring 1964, but it wasn't until the Christmas release of "Goldfinger" that James Bond became a phemomenon equal to another U.K. import, The Beatles.<p>The film shows its age with 007's reference to the Fab Four (telling "Golden Girl" Shirley Eaton that one should only listen to the moptops while wearing earmuffs), but otherwise remains a sturdy Bond thriller, one that saw the Bond formula more finely tuned than in the previous films (the formula would be perfected in the next film, "Thunderball"). The pre-credit sequence, like the ones for most of the films after 1977, has no connection to the story, but offers a sort of short hand to what the rest of the film holds: tongue-in-cheek humor that softens the somewhat sadistic violence, and a hero as elegant as he is deadly. <p>The villains are arguably Bond's best: Auric Goldfinger whose love of gold leads to his outlandish plan to knock-off Fort Knox, and his right-hand man, Oddjob, as silent as he is deadly, an assassin with a surprise more lethal than a rabbit in his hat. They are well played by Gert Frobe, the German actor previously best known for the "Dr. Mabuse" series, and Harold Sakata. When it comes to Bond babes, Honor Blackman of the original version of TV's "The Avengers," is one of the best. A woman rather than a girl, her Pussy Galore is as smart as she is sexy, and she's one of the few Bondbabes who you believe could teach 007 a thing or two about self-defense. <p>A couple of moments do not ring true, and may inspire unintentional laughs. When Goldfinger brings together the leading figures in organized crime, some of them behave too much like frightened schoolgirls to be believed ("I don't like this," one squeels, when their host turns out the lights), and the soldiers standing guard at Fort Knox fall to the ground a little too quickly when Pussy Galore's gang drops poison from their planes. <p>But such silliness does not detract from an otherwise superb thriller, well-acted (along with "Thunderball," this is Sean Connery's best performance as Bond) and brilliantly scored by John Barry whose title song, co-written by Leslie Bricusse and belted out by Shirley Bassey, rocked the top 40 and made the Bond films as notable for their music as for the gadgets and thrills.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A smart drama with two great performances..."></head><body><p>Ben Affleck has really grown as an actor in the past year. This is his best performance since &quot;Chasing Amy,&quot; and that's a hard one to beat. He plays Gavin, a lawyer who gets in an auto accident with Doyle, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Doyle gets his hands on some documents that Gavin needs for a case that very day and thus the two get into a cat-and-mouse escapade that feels surprisingly real as things unfold. The one thing this movie contains is an element of harsh realism and believability. Our characters are well scripted and the audience really understands them. We're never once asked to like our characters nor hate them. Instead, we are asked to empathize with them, especially Doyle, who is having family trouble and because of the accident is late to his divorce hearing. The one character we should like is Doyle, but even he has his faults. William Hurt plays an AA mentor who bails Doyle out of jail at one point and the two have a well-scripted conversation in which Hurt points out the faults of Jackson's character. &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; is definitely not a cheery film, but it is great in that the characters are three-dimensional and the acting is extremely good, especially from Affleck and Jackson. While this may not be one of Samuel L. Jackson's best films, at least it showcases Affleck as a talented, capable actor. I reccommend it to anyone looking for a movie that will make them think and requires more intelligence than the average popcorn flick.</p></body></html>

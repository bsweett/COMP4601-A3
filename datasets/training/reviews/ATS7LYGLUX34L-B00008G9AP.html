<meta name="summary" content="Too Long For It's Own Good"></head><body><p>They had me until the one-hour mark.<p>  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets adapts the second book in J.K. Rowling's mega-successful book series, and before you start bashing me for the two-star review, just let me say that I love the books. But there IS a reason why most book-to-movie transfers leave large chunks of the book on the cutting-room floor. Chamber of Secreets is just WAY too long at nearly three hours. I was loving it until about an hour in. Then we meet "Moaning Myrtle", and it was about then that I really started to notice entire scenes that had nothing to do with moving the plot along. A lean, mean 90-minutes or two-hours would have been much better. Did we really need TWO long scenes with the flying car? The scene in The Dark Woods with the spiders was cool, but it didn't serve the plot in any way. I was bored, and to be totally honest, the theater full of kids was getting restless too. By the time the actual SECRET of the Chamber of Secrets was revealed, I had a sore butt, and a wandering attention span, and there were restless kids running all over the theater asking when they could leave. Asking a kid to sit for nearly three hours is asking a LOT.<p>  On the plus side, the effects are MUCH better than last time. The performances are great, like last time, especially Emma Watson (Hermione), and the wonderfully expressive Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley). I'll be there when The Prisoner of Azkaban opens next fall; I just hope it's a little faster-paced.<p> P.S.- Make sure you stick around until after the credits end!</p></body></html>

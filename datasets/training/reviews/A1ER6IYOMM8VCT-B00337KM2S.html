<meta name="summary" content="UP IN THE AIR IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR!"></head><body><p>I must admit when this film started I thought I might be in store for just another romantic comedy, but my apprehension was soon thwarted as I found myself truly engrossed in this little film. Clooney who is a likable guy has almost always come off smarmy to me, but in this film he seems so right for the part and delivers a very solid performance. The rest of the cast is put together well with each tiny part adding a necessary piece to the puzzle. Of course I was expecting a very predictable ending and they through me a little curve which is always appreciated for film buffs like me who have seen way too many "Hollywood" movies. 'Up In The Air may not appeal to everyone, but it is an engaging film that feels very fresh!<br /><br />Thanks Queen B for recommending this one to me, although it was a while ago, I finally got around to it...and was well worth the wait!</p></body></html>

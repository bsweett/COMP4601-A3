The first movie from 2000 was a great start but had quite a few flaws to it and had a lot of room for improvement from there. Well, I'm proud to say that a good amount of that room is filled up with with lots more action packed storyline and much more intense plot. Let me just say that "X2: X-Men United" is a marvelous follow-up to the first X-Men movie and while that movie was very good, this one trashes that one by a mile with much more action-packed plot and greater intensity. <p>This movie also brings a lot of new characters into the picture such as Nightcrawler and newcomer Pyro. <p>The movie begins with the human and mutant societies sharing the planet except that the skyrocketing prejudices have polarized the two societies following an incident in D.C. and the anti-mutant hysteria reaches dangerous levels to where a vicious anti-mutant army general named William Stryker (Played by Brian Cox) launches an attack against the School For The Gifted and uses an experimental drug that manages to control the minds of mutants and makes them answer any questions that Stryker asks them and is on a quest to build his own version of Cerebro to use against the mutant population through the mind of the now captive Charles Xavier. Meanwhile Magneto escapes from the plastic prison and unlike the last movie, he teams up with his former rivals to fight against Stryker's forces. Meanwhile Wolverine goes back to Canada to try to remember his past and encounters the site of the long abandoned experimental lab, or is it abandoned? <p>This movie, following the footsteps of the first X-Men movie, has tons and tons of action packed sequences, and much darker and bitterer atmosphere to the movie especially towards the ending. <p>This movie still has it's flaws but nowhere near as much as the previous X-Men movie. Rogue, seaming looking more like a pure victim than a psychologically scarred character, plummets from a potential super heroine down to just a background character and played virtually no part in the events in the movie. I just hope that she plays a MUCH larger role in the next X-Men movie, whenever that one comes out. Storm fared a little better than in the last one, showing more personality and character and more intelligence but still nowhere near as much of the punch that the comic book character really has. Gambit still hasn't surfaced yet and he's one of my favorite characters. In terms of the missing characters, it's not necessarily bad that their not here as the comic books have SO many characters that it's impossible to bring every one of them onto one movie so I can't necessarily blame the moviemakers for leaving them out in this movie. Hopefully, Gambit, Jubilee, and Beast will surface in the next installment in this marvelous franchise.<p>On the other extreme though, the characters that fared well in the first movie, are even better than they were in the last one. Wolverine shows a chilling rage during the beginning part of the movie. Patrick Stewert proves that he IS Professor Charles Xavier. No one in my opinion could've played Xavier better than Stewert. Sir Ian McKellan does even better as the villainous master of magnetism Magneto. Magneto is even more chilling in this movie than in the last one. To me, it's great to see the rivalry between Magneto and Xavier continue to develop yet they have to work together to stop Stryker and to me, it shows how it seems like Xavier and Magneto are like two sides of the same coin but each side has conflicting goals. Brian Cox though steals the spotlight as he gives a chilling role as the extremely evil general William Stryker. Most of the rest of the characters are also improved. We also bring in Kurt Wagner a.k.a. Nightcrawler and also future villain Pyro. There are lots more characters besides the ones I mentioned that deserve attention but the three I mentioned are the highlights. <p>I view X2 as the movie where the possible war between mutants and normal humans seems to be in the beginning stages of this movie and it almost parallels what the possible outcome would be in the real world should prejudice overtake the minds of the societies of our world and lead to destructive rioting and even civil warfare. I think that both this and the first X-Men film have powerful messages of the dangers of discrimination against those who are `different' and how it causes devastation on all sides of the conflict.  <p>The special effects once again are amazing and the Cerebro room is absolutely amazing and how it shows the locations of the normal humans and the locations of the mutant populations. It almost is unsettling to see especially if there is technology that can locate every living human on the planet. <p>This movie is getting a lot of the justice that it deserves with it's success at the box office along with Spider Man. I have to say that this is the age of Marvel Comic moviemaking and the blossoming of two powerful franchises and let's hope they have a long lifetime as opposed to what happened with the Batman movie series with the disastrous "Batman & Robin" movie. It can't stop here with the second X-Men movie though. There's just so much more to bring out that this movie needs to continue well past the second X-Men movie. Until all that happens, "X2" will definitely deliver the action and entertainment to keep us entertained until it happens. Perhaps the third one should involve the Sentinels. <p>"X2" is a near epic result of great casting, great script, and strong plot and is destined to become a future classic. There's more than I can give out in words.</p></body></html>

If I wanted a Social message or a Message about Greed and the 1980's I'd pick up a Rag like the NyTimes or The Nation or some other Rag,The movie is over rated not only because of it's so-called description of the 80's(Wall Street-Another "80's" movie) but also due to it's lack of it making any sense,as much as Abstract Art Can be called "Art" I am sure others will disagree with me And call the Movie "Brilliant" and Factual. I say it's Just another so-called "Smart" movie where they were too lazy to write a Ending,but I guess it is hip not to make sense.</p></body></html>

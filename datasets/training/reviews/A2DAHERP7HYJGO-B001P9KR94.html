<meta name="summary" content="TRIUMPH OVER ADVERSITY"></head><body><p>Movie goers love a film where the hero triumphs over the most adverse conditions to attain a goal. And this goes back further than the pinnacle of this genre, ROCKY. So what did the voters of the Academy do this year when it came to an Oscar winner for best film? They picked SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.<br /><br />This movie features the most improved character when it comes to tough times. The major plot of the film is actually quite simple. A young man goes on TV in India for a WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIR show. His goal is to make enough to find the girl of his dreams and settle down with her. That's it. And yet, that's not all there is to it.<br /><br />The film uses a combination of present day situations combined with well executed flashbacks to show just how fortunate he is on the show. Each and every question asked of him is something he has learned through the rough and tumble times of his life. And troubled times they were.<br /><br />As the film opens our hero, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is being interrogated by the police. His suspected crime is cheating on the game show he is winning. How could someone of his background, a dweller from the poorest community in Mumbai (thus the Slumdog portion of the title), possible know the answers to these questions? As he is questioned, he provides the police chief as well as the viewers of the story of his life and how he came to know them.<br /><br />As a small child Jamal and his brother Salim play amid fields of garbage while living with their mother. A riot involving the Muslim and non-Muslim factions leads to their mother's murder and their quickly becoming orphans. Along with a young girl they meet named Latika, they live off the street until they are rescued by a missionary who collects young orphans.<br /><br />But this is no real missionary as it turns out he uses the small children to scam people on the street into giving them money. He collects it all. He even goes so far as to blind those that can sing so they will make more money. With a little luck, Salim, Jamal and Latika escape, only to have Latika captured before they can get away.<br /><br />Jamal is infatuated with Latika and his search for her spurs the romantic side of the story. He and his brother search for her until the day she is found. But this leads to more tragedy as Salim gets a gun and becomes a young gangster involved with crooks in town. A break between brothers results in Latika and Jamal parting ways once more.<br /><br />More and more happens to Jamal and each experience shows his determination to find a better life as well as Latika. And while Jamal works hard, attempting to rise above his circumstances, Salim dives into the worst the world has to offer, making a living for himself but at what cost?<br /><br />The end result is Jamal's appearance on the game show where he has the chance to make more than he could have ever dreamed of. And with the money he has the chance to rescue Latika from the fate that befell her not only at the hands of Salim but of the local gangster head who has chosen her for his own.<br /><br />There are more scenes and difficulties than I've listed here, but better to see them for yourself. And the best part of this film was the slow unspooling of the tale, as Jamal recounts his life and how each part of it provided the answers he needed to win, The world through his eyes is one of hope, the eyes of Salim a despair. How two brothers can see the world differently makes up a major portion of the tale.<br /><br />All of the acting in the film is impressive not only for the professionals but for the children who play them in their youth as well. Chosen to play these parts were actual children from the area, the real slumdog children. Dev Patel as the adult Jamal has a future ahead of him granted he gets parts as good as this one.<br /><br />So was this the best film that came out last year? Good enough that it deserved the Oscar for best film? Yes, it is an exceptional film. But I can think of others I enjoyed more. Then again I've rarely agreed with what the Academy chooses over the past few years. But if you enjoy good storytelling, then you'll want to make a point of watching this film. You won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

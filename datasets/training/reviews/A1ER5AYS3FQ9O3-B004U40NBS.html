<meta name="summary" content="Buzz-worthy, Oscar caliber performance from Portman"></head><body><p>When we tried to see this, every showing was sold out -except for the very last one of the evening. So we bought our tickets, strolled around a mall, and waited eagerly to view the film. It was worth the wait even though the movie had some significant flaws (more about that soon). I do understand why Natalie Portman has gotten much acclaim for her role as Nina, a young ballerina who seems to be on the rise to stardom. She might even win an Oscar for her performance. The role is extremely demanding and it is clear that she worked hard to get her body to fit the part, looking particularly thin (as many ballerinas do, almost anorexic). She also stretched her acting chops and took significant risks, including some fairly graphic sexual scenes as well as a believable depiction of a young woman with an unhinged mind.<br /><br />However, I felt very ambivalent about this film and wasn't the only one. Audiences leaving the theater were either talking positively about the film or giving it a thumbs down. Portman is superb when revealing how she tries to dig deeply within herself to portray both the White and Black Swan. The part of the White Swan comes easily to her but the darker, riskier role of the Black Swan taxes her emotionally. Nina is assured that she has the moves of an experienced ballerina. But she is criticized by the ballet company's director for her inability to bring passion to the role of the Black Swan.<br /><br />Dance fans will find a wealth of stunning choreography and insight into some parts of the world of ballet. Even those who aren't fond of ballet should be entranced by the dance scenes. I certainly was. But there seemed to be too many stereotypes. Barbara Hershey is usually a reliable actress but she seems to be off kilter here, being the overprotective mother. Nina's desire to be "perfect" resonates beyond the movie and serves as a reminder of how dancers often turn to self-destructive acts to stay in shape - throwing up, being anorexic or bulemic and more. In that regard, Nina could be at an extreme end of a spectrum of mental illness that may be all too prevalent in the dance world...although not as over the top as Nina (or let's hope not).<br /><br />Suspense is definitely created during scenes when it is hard to separate Nina's truth from fantasy. What is Nina actually seeing and what is an illusion? In some parts of the movie it is clear that she is hallucinating...in others, not so much so. In the end, I couldn't quite buy this as a psychological drama but thought it veered closer to a horror movie. Parts of this film were extremely painful to watch and if you have trouble watching someone in physical pain, including plenty of blood, consider yourself forewarned. There were plenty of gasps and moans from the audience during the particularly gruesome scenes.<br /><br />In the end, I couldn't help wondering: will this movie stand the test of time? Odds are high that viewers will always be entranced by the very lovely Natalie Portman. But will the movie's theme and plot development seem credible during repeat viewings? Only time will tell whether this becomes a classic dance and psychological/horror film or simply a temporary sensation.</p></body></html>

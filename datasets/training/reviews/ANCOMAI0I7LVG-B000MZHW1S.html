I am a fan of DiCaprio and I actually like Connelly despite her lack of range, and both actors had impressed me already this very year (`The Departed' and `Little Children' also being released in 2006) and so I was at least hoping they would elevate this film for me (although the spotty and awkward accent donned by DiCaprio was even distracting in the trailer).  I have lost the faith I once had in Hounsou, the one I have now knighted Sir Screamsalot.<br /><br />So, it's safe to say I expected this to be underwhelming.<br /><br />I didn't expect to see ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN though!<br /><br />I don't know if there is enough time in the world for me to express all that I find distasteful about this wretched film, and I don't know if I would want to subject any self-respecting reader to my tirade (nor do I think you would have the patience to bare with me on this one) so I'm going to try and be as brief as I can be.<br /><br />The film attempts to shed light on a very dark and troubling epidemic of sorts in Africa.  The harrowing truth behind conflict diamonds is heartbreaking and cruel and completely devastating.  That is lost in this mess of a film.  It gets lost in pointless violence (don't even try and justify this) and awkward speeches.  It gets lost in aimless direction and clich&eacute;d performances.  In fact, there is nothing to commend about this film.  The only thing that is worthy of mention is the message the film is trying to relay; the problem being that it just doesn't relay it well.<br /><br />Danny Archer is a selfish diamond smuggler who wants a giant raw diamond found by fisherman Solomon Vandy who has recently escaped enslavement by a ruthless rebel leader.  Maddy Bowen is a journalist who wants Archer to give her the inside scoop on the diamond smuggling operations.<br /><br />Vandy uses Archer to get his family (war torn) while Archer uses Vandy to get the stone while Dowen uses Archer to get her story.<br /><br />The film isn't quite certain where it wants to be.  I remember similar issues with `Beyond Borders' and I see a similarity here (although that film is far from this horrible).  The film is essentially a mindless action film that decides to (awkwardly) insert messages of enlightenment to the viewer.  In between countless scenes of bloodshed and screaming there is a fact driven monologue of how these stones are transported, and then there is more screaming and bullets.  The film opens with violence and it ends with it.  I remember looking at my wife and rolling my eyes about halfway through the film because it seemed as though no one could get through a single conversation without dodging a bullet.  It was relentless and it took away HEAVILY from the films core.<br /><br />I also felt that the interactions between characters felt forced and unnatural.  This is a result of poor scripting (the definition of POOR!), but it is also a direct result of lazy acting.  The standout here is Hounsou, and not in a good way.  His idea of acting is a simplistic approach.  When he is sad is cries.  When he is angry he screams.  When he is happy he smiles.  That is all.  Apparently he is mad a lot because all he does here is SCREAM, SCREAM, SCREAM.  It is so over-the-top and irritatingly ridiculous.  DiCaprio suffers from an awkward accent and insufferable dialog (I mean "bling bang"?  Really?) but he actually portrays the emotions correctly (and I was happy that he remained selfish throughout most of the film).  Connelly is a boring stereotype here, enough said.<br /><br />The script was just a hodgepodge of unrealistic encounters and scattered bullet fire.  The way Archer approaches Vandy, the way Vandy jeopardizes his life and the life of his son MORE THAN ONCE, the way Bowen chokes up on the phone...it ALL READS FALSE and ridiculously manipulative.<br /><br />The only (small) redeeming factor (no redemption really, just a well played part) is anything involving Kagiso Kuypers, who plays Dia, Vandy's missing son.  His scenes are a powerful testament to the darkness that engulfs this epidemic.  Sadly, his scenes are few and his presence is masked heavily by the horrific direction taken by Edward Zwick, whose haphazard vision single handedly botched what could have been a somewhat intelligent feature film.<br /><br />So, yes, this is a mess...a horrible mess that I would never wish upon anyone, even my worst enemies.</p></body></html>

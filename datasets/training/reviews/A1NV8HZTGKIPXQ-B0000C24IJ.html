That's what you get when you watch this quick and unrelenting trip into road trips gone haywire. The movie is a decent little throwback to the 70's type of horror films with a splash of "The Hills Have Eyes", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", and yes, "Deliverance", although there is no Ned Beatty in sight. Desmond Harrington is the main lead. He plays Chris, a young doctor in training on his way to a meeting. When he gets stuck in a traffic jam, he goes back to try to find a different route. Big mistake. When he goes through what's known as Bear Mountain, trouble starts. But after the opening, we already knew that. Taking his eye off the road for a second has him crashing into the back of a parked car in the middle of the road. Five friends who were out for a little nature trip got their tires sliced by wire laid in the road. The five personalities here are Jess(the bodacious Eliza Dushku), who is the tough heroine chick. Carly, who is the annoying one that gets even more annoying as the horrors continue. Her boyfriend Scott(Jeremy Sisto), the most likeable one of the bunch, and the expected horn dog couple(Kevin Zegers, Lindy Booth). Thinking that the wire was laid out on purpose, Chris and 3 of the friends set out to find a phone or someone to help. What they find is a shack lived in by three inbredded, cannibalistic killers who don't really like anyone coming into their neck of the woods. What ensues is a chase to find help and safety in the neverending maze of the woods, and to elude the killers. There is nothing overly original here, but the filmmakers keep it interesting fun and entertaining. There are about 7 deaths here, and 3 of them you only see the aftermath of. The deaths you do see are quite brutal and gruesome. The backwoods killers themselves are nasty and creepy, and make-up hero Stan Winston does a good job with their look. There are a number of interesting and harrowing scenes. The best of the bunch being the chase and fight through the watchtower and into the trees above. The acting is pretty solid. Harrington is a little wooden, but he gets the job done. Sisto is the shining star here as his character is nice, funny, and instantly likeable. Dushku is a worthy heroine, and as anyone who has seen "Buffy" can tell you, she can be tough, vulnerable, scary, and tragic. She does a pretty good job here as well. The script adds nothing new to the proceedings, but it does keep things moving along with enough of the good stuff coming up pretty quick. Director Rob Schmidt keeps things moving along at a nice pace, and the movie is pretty much a rollercoaster from start to finish that never really drags. It's over quickly and the end result is a pleasing and entertaining little horror film, but it won't remain long in the psyches of anyone who watches it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A vastly underrated and very stylish crime drama"></head><body><p>Brian De Palma's THE BLACK DAHLIA is the movie of the year so far for me, and the almost unanimous negative reviews baffle me.  Yes, the film dares to solve Hollywood's most legendary unsolved crime, but it is based on a novel by James Ellroy (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL) and not on strict fact.  I have not had the pleasure of reading Ellroy's book because it seems long out of print at Amazon.com.  The fact is that a beautiful raven-haired aspiring actress named Elizabeth "Betty" Short was found savagely murdered in a vacant Hollywood weed field in early 1947, her body cut in half and her mouth cut from ear to ear.  Her killer was never found.  The case was never closed and may, in fact, still be open.<br /><br />The De Palma fiction is convincing:  boxing detective rivals  Aaron Eckhart and Josh Hartnett tie the case to lesbian actress Hilary Swank and the filmmaker who directed sleazy 16mm black-and-white films starring Elizabeth Short.  De Palma wisely never shows the crime; as in real life, detectives find the dead body the next day in a vacant lot.  And we only see slivers of the corpse.  Ingeniously, and you may need to be a film scholar to pick up on this, the slashed mouth is made to look like Conrad Veidt in a 1928 silent called THE MAN WHO LAUGHS, which is screened often during THE BLACK DAHLIA.  And both Ellroy's novel and De Palma's movie take their name, in turn, from a 1946 Alan Ladd film noir called THE BLUE DAHLIA.<br /><br />The movie dares to have a romantic happy ending, which I may be alone in finding satisfying.  Hartnett wraps up the case, then goes home to his sweetie, yet another actress (Scarlett Johansson).  As with everyone in THE BLACK DAHLIA, Johansson smokes endless cigarettes, including in fancy black holders.  (Actually, I am getting tired of seeing her smoking in every movie.)  This movie is blessed with superb actors and, contrary to the critics, actors whom I personally found comfortable playing film noir and chain-smoking.  The performances are all excellent.<br /><br />And, oh man, the style here!  Working all over Hollywood and, of all places, Bulgaria, De Palma and production designer Dante Ferretti truly capture the very look and smell of 1947 Los Angeles down to the slightest detail.  For a movie filmed in Technicolor and Panavision, the great Vilmos Zsigmond (THE DEER HUNTER, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND) creates a dusty sepia look that is just right.  Costumer Jenny Beavan, working heavily in browns and olives and blacks in dresses and blouses and sweaters and suits, has done costumes for James Ivory.  And the trumpet sound of Mark Isham's score evokes nothing less than the towering score by Jerry Goldsmith for CHINATOWN.  These people and everyone else are working at peak form.<br /><br />But at the helm is Brian De Palma, whose direction is just perfection.  I adore THE BLACK DAHLIA and highly recommend it, now in a theater or soon on letterboxed DVD--hopefully with an excellent and chilling 1970's TV movie with Lucie Arnaz called WHO IS THE BLACK DAHLIA? as a bonus.  De Palma's movie has a hard "R" rating for strong violence, strong sexual content, strong language, and heavy smoking.  122 minutes.</p></body></html>

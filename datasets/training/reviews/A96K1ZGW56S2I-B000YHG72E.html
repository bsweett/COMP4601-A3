One Christmas Santa was putting presents under the tree at an orphanage and little Buddy snuck out of his crib and crawled into Santa's sack. Santa didn't know about it until he got back home in the North Pole. By then, he couldn't take the baby back. They would have to wait at least a year. So a kindly Master Elf and his wife who had no children of their own, adopt Buddy and raise them as their son. Buddy, though just doesn't fit as an elf. Not only is he too tall for everything, but he can't work as fast, either. Everyone thinks he's a klutz.  Papa Elf has to tell Buddy the truth and Buddy then leaves the North Pole to search for his biological father (James Caan) in New York City.  Add in a couple of slapstick gags, some really witty and original dialogue, a touch of boy meets girl story, a Scrooge-like man who has a change of heart, and a crash landing of Santa's sleigh in Central Park and it makes for one hilarious and charming Christmas story. Not too mention Bob Newhart.<br /><br />ELF is bound to become a Christmas classic that people watch every year. There aren't very many Christmas movies like that. The majority of Christmas movies that are made are seen once, put on video and DVD, and then forgotten except by strange little trivia lovers like myself. However, every few years a Christmas movie comes along that ends up becoming a new favorite and eventually becomes a classic, like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, THE CHRISTMAS STORY, and NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION.  ELF will be the next movie added to those lists.<br /><br />Will Ferrell is at his comic genius best, portraying just the right mix of innocence and sincerity without seeming to be mushy. One of the best things about the film is seeing Bob Newhart, a comic legend in his own right, teamed up with Ferrell. It's a comedians generational crossover. Ed Asner gets to be a little less cranky than he often is since he plays Santa, and he does a fine job--why wasn't he ever cast in more friendly roles sooner?  James Caan also does a wonderful job as Buddy's long lost father, Walter. Caan isn't given the best lines or material, but is able to make it work. Mary Steenburgen gives a strong supporting performance as Walter's wife and Zooey Deschanel is absolutely adorable as Jovie, the department store clerk who Buddy falls in love with.<br /><br />The movie has a great cast, good writing, intriguing direction, and an involving story. It's slightly quirky, but not so much so to turn anyone off.  In terms of Christmas movies, ELF is bound to become one of the giants.</p></body></html>

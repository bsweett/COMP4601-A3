<meta name="summary" content="Prototype Burton ........ That's a good thing :) :)"></head><body><p>I would not say that this was one of Burtons best films just because he has made so many great one such as such as "The Nightmare Before Christmas", "Beetlejuice", "Edward Scissorhands", "Batman" ect: but "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is certinaly good, You can tell that it is made by Mr. Burton mostly because the Shapes, colors & Characors have Burton written all over them!, Johnney Depp again delivers a knock out performance as Willie Wonka In what I thought was deserving of the Golden Globe for best performance in a Musical or comedy and a nomination for an oscar! Burton pours his heart into this film trying to make it more like the book rather than the 70's "Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory".<br /><br />In my opinion this is not as good as the 70's "Willie Wonka" but is quite good none the less, I though that they cut a few good things out and I also have to admitt that I was rather dissapointed with the new "Oompa Loompas"... But the misbehaving children in this one were better than the one's in the 70's!<br /><br />The visuals in this movie were actually great and if you see how much money this movie cost to make you will see why ... One a new topic, some of the line sused in this film were drop dead hilarious such as ...<br /><br />Everything that you see in this room is edible, even I'm edible but that is what we call "Cannablism" and frowned upon in Most modern society's .... (Wonka)<br /><br />"Was'nt that wonderful!, It started out a little slow but that ending ... I mean .... WOW! (Wonka)<br /><br />"The .........................." (Wonka)<br /><br />"Parents?" (little girl)<br /><br />"Yeah ... Mom's and Dad's!  (Wonka)<br /><br />........ OOOOOOO you have to watch the film to understand!, I recommend this film to EVERYONE because this summer of 2005 boxoffice hit is really quite a fun filled and entertaining Burton Film. But let me say it again .... it's not as good as the original ....<br /><br />Grade: B+</p></body></html>

Will Ferrell brings in the laughs as he always does and they kill with each deliver...funny and I liked this better then Dodgeball....a comedy classic of its own kind...laugh, cry...Anchorman is sweet. Actors who make guest cameos are the following: Luke Wilson (Old School, Alex and Emma), Vince Vaughn (Dodgeball,Swingers) , Jack Black (School Of Rock, High Fiedelity), Tim Robbins (Mystic River, The Truth About Charlie), Danny Trejo (Spy Kids, Once Upon A Time In Mexico) and  Ben Stiller (Dodgeball, Zoolander).</p></body></html>

The last stand-alone film from Marvel Studios to set up next year's mega-super hero opus The Avengers, Captain America stars Chris Evans (who funny enough played The Human Torch in the two forgettable Fantastic Four films) as the titular star-spangled hero, who takes on the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) during World War II in an effort to stop his nefarious scheme and his evil Hydra organization.  What makes Captain America so enjoyable is the fact that director Joe Johnston (The Wolfman, The Rocketeer) injects so much heart and soul into the otherwise pedestrian script, and the fact that Evans himself is surprisingly enjoyable in the title role without falling into the kind of cockiness/self-referential performance that often accompanies his roles.  Hugo Weaving is great, and Tommy Lee Jones steals the show as well, but in the end we all know what this really is meant for: The Avengers.  And by the time the end credits roll, you'll be salivating for it like never before.  All in all, Captain America: The First Avenger is a supremely enjoyable and just plain awesome superhero film that is more than worth your time and attention, and it does a fantastic job at making us all forget about that early 90s schlock-fest with the rubber-earred suit.</p></body></html>

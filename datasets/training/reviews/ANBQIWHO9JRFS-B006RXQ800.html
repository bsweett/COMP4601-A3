<meta name="summary" content="3.5. Sorry Scorsese, this story ain't epic.  It's not bad either, though."></head><body><p>There's a common thread to most of the moderately positive reviews of this film, which tends to be that "Gangs of New York" is generally well-made and fairly entertaining, but where the hell does it get off being 2 and 3/4 hours long?  I hear that it was originally supposed to be 4 hours long, which is just baffling.  Perhaps at that length it had some elements which made it seem truly expansive, but now it just seems like a severely padded run-of-the-mill revenge story.  Now, mind you, I'm not inherently opposed to lengthy movies or anything like that, but the story here just doesn't seem at all suited for the epic format, as the final product clearly demonstrates.  However, I can't say that the padding isn't fairly interesting, and it's all reasonably involving.  The film looks terrific, has some very cool fight scenes, and the acting is generally excellent apart from DiCaprio.  (And DiCaprio isn't exactly bad here, and he's proven elsewhere that he is a good actor he just isn't given much of anything to do even though he's the main character.)  Daniel Day-Lewis, in particular, is a total hoot as Butcher Bill.  Not exactly the most believable character around, but he's certainly entertaining to watch.  Still, the story is only interesting as spectacle i.e. I never cared about or was even much interested in the characters, and though the film seems to think it's saying something about New York and America or whatever, I don't see it.  And, again, damned if anything actually happens in the middle section of the film.  But I was never bored, so I think it's worth a watch.<br /><br />Grade: B-</p></body></html>

No doubt fans of the "Hornblower" DVD sets will like this movie. Any fans of classics like "Damn the Defiant" with Alec Guinness should find it entertaining.<br /><br />Russell Crowe does a fine job of portraying the captain of a British ship in search of the French enemy. His enemy is a worthy quarry and must be tracked to the ends of the Earth. Even when you think the movie is concluded you find it is not. The acting is excellent and they did a fine job of casting.<br /><br />The real treat is the photography and sets. The level of detail is phenomenal. Rarely have I seen such attention to what helps to make a great seafaring movie, a great ship set. The ambiance of sea life is so well preserved you will think you are smelling the sea breeze and feel the salty spray across your face. That or you will feel cramped and smell the sweat and powder below decks as they engage the enemy.<br /><br />The DVDs included in this are first quality and the picture and sound is excellent. It includes numerous extras you can find listed under the details above. All in all this movie was masterfully done.<br /><br />I initially rated this four stars. I would change that to three if I could now. The reason is the more I reflected on this movie I realized I wouldn't be likely to watch it again for some time. What I mean is it does not have a great deal of replayability. The reason is that I wasn't happy with the constant chasing of only one quarry and then even at the end the chase starts all over again. You feel you have been cheated out of a victory and that leaves a hole in the story. At least with the other sea movies I mentioned there is a conclusion, good or bad, it ends and you feel good about it.</p></body></html>

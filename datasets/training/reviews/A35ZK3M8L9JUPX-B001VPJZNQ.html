<meta name="summary" content="The Rundown"></head><body><p>In order to get out of hock with mobster Billy Walker, restaraunteur-turned-"retrieval expert" Beck has to go down to Brazil and retrieve Billy's ne'er-do-well archaeologist-wannabe son Travis, who is searching for an ancient gold idol called the Gato del Diablo. This idol is prized by not only the local population as the path to their salvation, but by Cornelius Hatcher, slavedriving operator of the Helldorado mining town who oppresses said population in the name of profits, and Hatcher just won't let Beck leave with Travis. Gotta tell ya, folks, The Rundown is a whole lot of fun. This movie is funny from start to end. If you love action and comedy then you will love this movie. Take my advice and see this movie you will have a great time.</p></body></html>

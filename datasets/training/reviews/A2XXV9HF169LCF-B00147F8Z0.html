If I could give no stars... well, it wasn't as bad as some other movies, but I'm glad I bought it and watched it at home on DVD instead of going to the movies to see it. If I'd seen it in the movies I wouldn't have been able to help myself: I would have mocked it ruthlessly in a loud voice in public. At least this way I managed to do all my mocking in the privacy of my own home. It was cheaper than going to the movies, too: add up tickets and popcorn and drinks for both my husband and I versus the price of the DVD, and it ended up being a much better idea to have the DVD.<br /><br />Frankly, this movie stank. I wasn't expecting anything original but they just went complete gore-fest: let's see how many icky concepts we can cram in as short a period of time as possible! Now, one icky concept per movie is cool: it has impact, it has horror, it's the focus of all your attention and the suspense is a line that runs up your spine. If you just dump as many as you can in a short period of time, it loses it's grotesque appeal and becomes... laughable. Like the movie. Plus, I have a huge TV with really good resolution, and I couldn't tell who was getting killed half the time. Which was no loss, since I didn't really care who was getting killed.<br /><br />Also? Very tired of the military bombing cities just to contain ever-expanding threats. It's been done, let's move on.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Solid, entertaining action"></head><body><p>Those expecting a connection to Isaac Asimov's classic book which this is supposedly based on will be more than disappointed here, as I, Robot is pure, solid, entertaining mainstream action with Alex Proyas, director of Dark City and the original Crow at the helm.  A beefed up Will Smith plays paranoid cop Del Spooner in future Chicago, and needless to say due to a past tragedy, he doesn't trust the "helper" robots which are abundant in society.  Spooner gets his wish of a robot possibly being a bad guy when a new design of robot (Alan Tudyk of the upcoming Serenity and TV's short lived Firefly) is accused of murdering his creator (James Cromwell).  Soon enough, Spooner is knee deep in a conspiracy involving this new model of robot, the obedience of the "3 laws of robotics", and whether this artificial life can evolve.  While it hardly bears any resemblance to Asimov's book, the spirit of it is still here, and Smith does a good job as the paranoid hero.  The CGI effects are well done for the most part, and Tudyk is superb as well.  It's not a perfect action/sci-fi movie, but for what it is, it's still pretty good.</p></body></html>

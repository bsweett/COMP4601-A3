<meta name="summary" content="Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Disney Special Platinum Edition)"></head><body><p>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Disney Special Platinum Edition) is a cartoon that was first shown in the cinemas 1937 and still it is an amazing cartoon. The charchters are still as alive and vivid now as then. The music and songs are amazing and the story which is adapted by the Grimm Brothers is timeless. I love the scenes with the small animals and the scene with the lost small bird is so cute. This is certainly one of Walt Disneys best movies and certainly a nugget in the Disney cartoon vault. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.</p></body></html>

Though not as edgy as the first this rendition didn't shy away from the content or occasional seedy remark, either.  I tend to wear thin as musicals but the director did a great job balancing dialogue with dance numbers.  All in all a pretty fun flick considering one moment it makes fun of Americana then attempts to make philosophical statements the next.</p></body></html>

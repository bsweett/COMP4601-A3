Most people know the storyline of three violent men and their pursuit of $200,000 in Confederate gold coins buried in a cemetery. Allowing nothing to slow them down, the trio cuts a violent path to the gold. For the extended version DVD, 14 minutes of footage has been added to the movie that were never part of the American release. Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach re-recorded the dialogue in these scenes because an English audio track was never created. It is almost forty years since the movie was made and Eastwood and Wallach have aged which is noticeable in their voices, but that doesn't detract from the overall viewing pleasure of the movie. My only problem with the DVD is the gunshots. Spaghetti westerns had a distinctive noise when guns were fired. Here on this DVD the gunshots have been changed to a more Americanized gunshot. Minor squabble, but I had to get it off my chest. Even with this minor problem this is an incredible DVD that fans of the movie need to have in their collection.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is excellent as Blondie, "the Good," a bounty hunter who by accident discovers the name of the grave where the gold coins are buried. Lee Van Cleef is equally as good as the steely-eyed Angel Eyes, "the Bad," a vicious gunfighter who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the gold. Eli Wallach steals the movie as Tuco, "the Ugly," the Mexican bandit who knows the name of the cemetery, but not the name on the grave. The trio are great throughout, providing plenty of great shootouts, but also some great dialogue. The movie also stars Luigi Pistilli as Father Ramirez, Tuco's brother, Mario Brega as Corporal Wallace, Aldo Guiffre as an alcoholic Union captain, Aldo Sambrell, Benito Stefanelli, and Al Mulock.<br /><br />The Extended Version Collector's Set is full of extras viewers will eat up. The DVD features the widescreen presentation of the movie with 14 additional minutes of footage, audio commentary from film critic Richard Schickel, "Leone's West" a making of documentary with cast(Eastwood and Wallach) and crew interviews, "The Leone Style" a featurette about director Sergio Leone's unique style, "The Man Who Lost the Civil War" a documentary about the actual happenings of the Civil War that take place in the movie, "Reconstructing the GBU" on how the audio recording was done, and "Il Maestro" a feature about composer Ennio Morricone and his famous score. The DVD also has two deleted scenes that weren't able to be inserted into the movie, a French trailer with other missing footage, a US trailer that identifies Tuco as the Bad and Angel Eyes as the Ugly, several collectible mini-posters from around the world, and a collectible booklet with an essay by Roger Ebert. If you have the original DVD, I recommend you keep it just to have the original US release, but buy this DVD as well. This Extended Version DVD is truly one of the few movies you can say is a must have DVD. Buy this movie!</p></body></html>

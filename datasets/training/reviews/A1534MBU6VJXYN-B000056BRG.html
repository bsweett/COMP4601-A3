Brimming with amazing performances, dazzling set pieces, and an incredibly well written storyline, "Ben-Hur" has stood the test of time to become a defining moment in cinema.<br /><br />Most reviewers have gone over the plot in great detail, so I will skip over that. I will say that Charlton Heston, one of the legends of filmdom, has never been better than in his role as Judah Ben-Hur. Great actors like Paul Newman, Burt Lancaster and Rock Hudson were all offered a chance to play this character, and while all of them would've no doubt done a fine job, no one could possibly beat Heston in the part. He plays it an unforgettable and one a kind manner that's very difficult to put into words. The supporting cast is top notch, specifically Stephen Boyd, who as Messala creates an unforgettable amount of tension between him and Heston. Both Heston & Boyd received Oscars (this film won 11 out of 12 nominations), and deservedly so.<br /><br />The directing by Wyler is incredible, especially the chariot race, which is one of a kind and one of the best scenes in the history of the movies. If made today, that sequence would've been entirely done in CGI, and while it would've looked cool no doubt, it wouldn't hold the same excitement, danger, substance and believability that it does with real actors.<br /><br />I love that Jesus's face is never actually shown throughout the movie. It makes his presence in the movie all the more real and emotional. The crucifixion sequence at the end is heartwrenching to watch. The actor who played Jesus was an opera singer named Claude Heater (this was the only movie he ever did), and he's simply amazing.<br /><br />What's so great about "Ben-Hur" is that despite the religious themes spread throughout the plot, you don't need to be religious at all to enjoy it (I myself am a Catholic who is firm in my belief in God). I know atheists who told me how great they thought "Ben-Hur" was. It goes to show just how great and how powerful this movie truly is.<br /><br />The special features on this dvd are great (though I still need to update to the four disc edition), as is the sound and picture quality. This is a motion picture that truly belongs in everyone's dvd collection.</p></body></html>

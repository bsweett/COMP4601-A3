Raised by the fisherman, Perseus was treated like a son despite his mysterious beginnings. But when his adoptive family is killed by Hades (Ralph Fiennes) in the midst of the Greek city Argos' war against Zeus (Liam Neeson), Perseus finds out that he's a demigod, the son of Zeus. Rather than joining the gods in their war with the humans, Perseus joins the humans in an effort to find out how destroy Hades' Kraken, a legendary destroyer of cities, and in turn seek revenge for the death of his family.<br /><br />I'm fairly certain that I'm not the only one who, when this went into production, wondered why they chose to remake a 1981 film rather than creating a movie based on the hugely popular God of War video game series. I guess part of my reticence to this idea has to be my general disinterest in remakes, but at the same time one has to admit that video game movies generally fare worse than remakes as a rule. Then the casting started poring in for this remake/reimagining, and I started to get a bit excited about it. Sam Worthington proved his mettle as the best part of Terminator: Salvation and did a great job in Avatar, and anytime you have Liam Neeson and/ or Ralph Fiennes in a movie, especially together (they're first time on screen together since Schindler's List) you're most likely up for a good time. To fill out the brilliance on screen, Louis Leterrier was set to helm the project having done movies that have ranged from merely good (Transporter, The Incredible Hulk) to transcendent (Unleashed or Danny the Dog). Needless to say I was more than slightly interested to see what this would all lead to.<br /><br />While you might expect this film to completely re-imagine the film, but rather even down to the special effects the films has a much more old school feel to it. This is both one of the strengths of the movie and a detriment to the movie as well. While it utilizes all of the special effects at it's disposal, it still lumbers like an unweildy beast at times. The mix of CGI with the look of practical effects doesn't look as good as other movies that have come out recently, and other creations don't mix well with the practical creations. Overall, though, Leterrier knows how to work an action sequence, and the action really does work, even if the ending is slightly anticlimactic. The most disappointing aspect of the movie though is the 3-D transfer which doesn't appear to be in 3-D except the very beginning of the movie, other than that the cost of the 3-D surcharge is asking a lot of viewers, and proves just to be nothing more than a cash making gimmick by Warner Bros.<br /><br />With all of the great actors that were involved in this movie, the acting is strangely subpar. Ralph Fiennes hams it up as god of the underworld Hades as does Jason Flemyng as former King of Argos Arcisius, and Liam Neeson isn't given much to do as uber-god Zeus. Sam Worthington is surprisingly flat as the demigod Perseus. Most of the time Worthington appears to be bored or just not even trying. Of everyone on the cast the most believable actors are Pete Postelthwaite as Perseus adoptive father Spyros, and his demise early on in the movie is truly lamentable, and Gemma Arterton as Io, the ageless beauty who helps lead Perseus to his destiny of defeating the gods.<br /><br />I'm not saying the movie's horrible, this isn't Transformers 2, but it's also not Avatar either. All in all it's still a fun movie worth a look-see, but it's definitely not the best that the cast and crew could possibly have to offer. I enjoyed myself at the theater for this one (even if I was annoyed by paying the 3-D surcharge for nothing), and I suggest you give it a shot. You might find yourself slightly disappointed, but you'll probably still have fun as well.<br /><br />3/5</p></body></html>

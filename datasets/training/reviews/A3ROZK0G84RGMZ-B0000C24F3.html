<meta name="summary" content="This Is What I Call A Box Set!!"></head><body><p>This box is fully loaded.  Two versions of each movie.  I enjoy the director's cut versions more than the theatrical versions.  The first two movies are the best in my opinion.<br /><br />ALIEN- a complete sci-fi masterpiece.  The story, the actors, and the setting are superb.  The special effects were awesome for the time of 1979.  The chest thing messed me up back then!!  I love it.<br /><br />ALIENS- Ripley returns to aide in what she believes is a rescue mission but is mislead.  Jones stays home though.  More action packed as James Cameron takes the helm at this one.  Excellent sequel.<br /><br />ALIEN 3- Kinda wierd how she lands on a planet used solely for a mens prison.  The dog/alien mixture is pretty cool.  Is she with Child?<br /><br />ALIEN Resurrection- A new form of Ripley?  This fourth installment was quite enjoyable considering part three was stank.  Why does she play basketball good?  Alien blood?<br /><br />my review was kinda lacking on the info but believe me this box set is worth the price.</p></body></html>

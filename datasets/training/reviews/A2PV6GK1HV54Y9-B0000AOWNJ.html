<meta name="summary" content=""Before you die - you see the ring.""></head><body><p>The Ring is a smart, psychological thriller about a video tape that possess those who watch it to die seven days later, with the help of journalist and grieving aunt, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) tries to prevent the deaths of herself, her son, and ex-love. The Ring is directed so good, I enjoyed this film from beginning to end, as always Naomi Watts is great as Rachel. The sequel is not as scary or exciting as this one. The Ring is a well-done horror flick without all that blood and gore, defintely rent this one, a true classic. Excellent film!</p></body></html>

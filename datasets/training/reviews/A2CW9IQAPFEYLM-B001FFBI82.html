<meta name="summary" content="A war movie with a difference"></head><body><p>Most war movies are obviously categorized as "action" movies, but this is slightly different. The men have gone through their Marine bootcamp training, where they've gained the confidence and pride necessary to do their jobs, thanks to their somewhat sterotypical monsterish drill sergeant (think of Louis Gossett in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN). Jake Gyllenhaal plays the real life Anthony Swofford, who is further tormented and molded into an elite sniper by Jamie Foxx as Sergeant Sykes (Foxx is excellent). Swofford adds to the differences found in this movie - he is set off from the others by his detached personality (he reads Camus, for one thing). When the first Irag War breaks out they are ready and gung-ho for action.<br /><br />But here where the war movie action would typically begin, inaction comes to dominate. The men don't fight, but wait to fight (as the days tick by, their numbers are flashed on the screen). Talk comes to replace action - Foxx spiels about his great love for the Marines, the men fantasize about well, what men fantasize about, old movie images of war (such as APOCALYPSE NOW) take over for the real thing. Sometimes crazy things take place - a football game played wearing gas masks, for example.<br /><br />Sometimes the men are shown under great stress, weeping and cracking up, though it's hard to see exactly why, as if director Mendes was just trying to show us these guys have emotions after all. Mendes is also not above making cheap shots: "We never have to come back [here] again," says one Marine at war's end - sharp elbow in ribs just in case we didn't get the irony.<br /><br />But the acting is excellent, and the camaraderie among the men rings true. And the bleak desert landscape is rendered starkly and well by Roger Deakins. The fact that things are over before you know it and it's the training and the waiting that weighs the heaviest comes across pointedly in this movie.</p></body></html>

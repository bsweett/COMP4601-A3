<meta name="summary" content="Two Hours Of Magic"></head><body><p>What happens when you have a movie with two of the funniest people in America (Lily Tomlin and Garrison Keillor) and the most talented actress of her generation (Meryl Streep) directed by one of the best living directors, Robert Altman, who gave the world both NASHVILLE and MASH? Two Hours of Magic. Tomlin and Streep (The Johnson Girls) are joined by Kevin Kline (Guy Noir), John Reilly (Lefty), Woody Harrelson (Dusty), Tommy Lee Jones (The Axeman), and Robin and Linda Williams, playing themselves as regular bluegrass performers on Mr. Keillor's (he wrote the screenplay by the way) radio show--here on Station WLT which stands for "with lettuce and tomato"-- along with a host of other fine performers. There is not a dog in the lot.<br /><br />The plot is thin. After thirty years, Mr. Keillor is doing his last "Prairie Home Companion" show. The theatre has been sold and will be razed for a parking lot. (It is no secret that there are those in the U. S. Congress whose mission by cutting off funding, is to eliminate public radio, the home of "A Prairie Home Companion.) The Axeman (Tommy Lee Jones) cometh; but he falls into the clutches of the beautiful, blond Angel of Death; and he goeth. Lefty and Dusty crack a series of jokes so awful that they are funny, Streep and Keillor's version of the A. P. Carter standard "Gold Watch and Chain is not to be missed, and Robin and Linda Williams play and sing beautiful bluegrass music. Unlike many comedians whose humor is ugly and mean, Keillor and Tomlin are always gentle even as they poke fun at all our foibles and are a joy to watch.<br /><br />When all the news just repeats inself-- the fighting in Iraq has now gone on longer than World War Two and the past week marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the first AIDS case that was reported in Los Angeles in 1981, with millions dead and millions more infected and no end in sight, we needed this film. So come in out of the heat, put your cell phones on "vibrate", sit back, forget your cares for two hours and enjoy a movie more refreshing than a frosted coke.</p></body></html>

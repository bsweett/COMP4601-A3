<meta name="summary" content="Political Paranoid Thriller Extraordinaire!"></head><body><p>&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; is a brilliantly-conceived indictment of the American political process wrapped around a riveting, heartbreaking thriller.  Career-defining performances and a surprisingly witty, unsettling screenplay make this a film for the ages.<p>Sgt. Raymond Shaw (played with palpable disdain by Laurence Harvey) is thoroughly disliked by his entire unit in Korea . . . that is, until his unit gets nabbed by the North Koreans and subjected to eerie brainwashing techniques.  We don't see the brainwashing, but we see the results in a famous scene where the unit sits politely in chairs in front of what they believe is a sewing circle but in actuality is a who's who of evil communist stereotypes (director John Frankenheimer masterfully cuts between real and imagined audiences, generating laughs as well as chills).  A couple of horrifying murders are committed (poor, poor Eddie Lembeck!), foreshadowing the planned carnage to come.  <p>Back in the States, Sgt. Shaw, winner of the Medal of Honor, refuses to be the political pawn of his mother (Angela Lansbury), who has remarried the fop Senator Iselin (James Gregory, in a masterful performance of boorish incompetence).  Mrs. Iselin, bearing more than the usual motherly devotion to her son, is shocked to hear that Raymond wants nothing to do wtih Senator Iselin's career.  Unfortunately for Raymond, he has no idea how much control Mother has over him.<p>Other members of Shaw's unit, who are robotically convinced that Sgt. Shaw is the best guy in the world, are having nightmares (these nightmares are how we see some of the brainwashing -- very effective).  One, Major Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra, never better on film), is convinced that something is up, because he knows that he never liked Shaw, but that his brain is telling him otherwise.  Initially dismissed as a fatigued loon by his superiors, he doggedly pursues his instincts and tracks down Shaw.  Eventually, they become friends, and Marco learns that not everything is alright with Raymond after Raymond mindlessly walks into a lake in the middle of winter. <p>Raymond, too, has been brainwashed.  In a powerful indictment of the power of political images, the queen in a deck of cards turns Raymond into a robot . . . a robot designed to bring the American political process to its knees.  Senator Iselin, gaining popularity by making baseless charges of Communists in the State Department (in a wonderful scene, Mrs. Iselin deduces a way for Senator Iselin to remember the number of Communists using a certain steak sauce bottle).  <p>The movie constantly unsettles the viewer.  Ben Marco falls for a very unusual woman (Janet Leigh), whose unusual statements keep you wondering if she is a plant by the Communists to keep tabs on Ben.  Repeated images of Abraham Lincoln dominate the picture (and you remember how he ended his presidency).  And most heartbreaking, Raymond is forced to test the bounds of his brainwashing control against the people he loves most of all.  The (near) absolute and total destruction of Raymond Shaw and all that he holds dear (by his mother, no less) is the emotional core of the film.<p>Shot in captivating black and white, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; is a thriller for the ages.  Pulling few punches, &quot;Candidate&quot; will leave the audience breathless as the tension builds during the final scene at the political convention.  It will also leave you aghast . . . this is the gold standard for political thrillers!</p></body></html>

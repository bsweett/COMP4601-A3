<meta name="summary" content="very action-packed"></head><body><p>all of the Spider-Man movies are action-packed, and Spider-Man 3 is no exception. in the end, Venom gets blown up and then the New Goblin and Sandman get a conscience, and then New Goblin dies. I recommend this movie to those who are superhero buffs, and I hope that they make another Spider-Man movie</p></body></html>

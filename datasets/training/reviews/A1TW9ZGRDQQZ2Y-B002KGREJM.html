<meta name="summary" content="A Sometimes Boring Film With a Great Performance"></head><body><p>This is one of the few times I actually dozed off to sleep from time to time while watching a movie. Forest Whitaker is the real deal here and deserves his praise, but I still can't believe Leonardo DiCaprio didn't get a nomination for The Departed. That was the performance of the year for me. The movie was pretty good at times, but it just didn't have enough substance to interest me for the entire length. It was good to see Agent Scully again (aka Gillian Anderson), but she was barely in the film. I would wait to catch this one on DVD, if only to see Forest Whitaker in his most powerful role.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ah-nuld is excellent -- and so is everything else!!"></head><body><p>With the possible exception of Linda Hamilton's hair, this movie has aged well, and stands up under scrutiny today -- a remarkable achievement.  Part thriller, part romance, part time travel paradox, The Terminator was a blast when it first came out and is just as much fun to watch now.<p>This DVD edition is terrific.  You can listen or watch subtitles in English, French or Spanish.  Special features include: trailers -- two from television, two for US theaters and one for foreign theaters; two documentaries -- an 18 minute retrospective with James Cameron (JC) and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the new one-hour "Other Voices" featuring cast and crew recollections; 5 deleted scenes and 2 deleted arcs, with JC commentary; a treatment, the fourth draft and the final draft of the script; and a photo gallery of JC's artwork, production stills, Stan Winston effects, special effects, and publicity materials.  There is a lot to see here and it is all interesting.  There are some fascinating revelations here -- for instance, originally conceiving of The Terminator as an everyman who could be inconspicuous anywhere, Arnold was originally interviewed for the part of Kyle Reese and OJ Simpson was being considered for The Terminator!  Yikes.<p>Lovely package.<p>Note to Macintosh users:  Normally I would grade down for having material that is inaccessible to Mac users, but those items are made available here as html files -- if not an entirely satisfactory solution, at least an effort was made.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good movie"></head><body><p>Captain America is a good movie, good superhero movie. Now, let me clarify this now, I've never read a CA comic, don't know how closely this (movie) relates to those (comics). Okay, moving on! I like the story, and the setting. Interesting to see a superhero WWII setting. The characters were good, and the choices of actors and actresses for each role was perfect. I also like how they gave a nod to Iron Man (was that his {Iron Man's} dad, or granddad, as a character?). The ending was perfect to tie in to the endings of certain other Marvel movies (Iron Man 1 & 2, The Incredible Hulk, and Thor), setting up The Avengers perfectly. Good movie that I recommend. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DEFINITELY WORTH MY TIME"></head><body><p>Saw is not the kind of movie which will make you wanna shut your eyes,grab the arm of the person sitting with you,make you jump from your couch and the other things one expects from a movie that is believed to be of much horror and brutality. I saw it last night and I think it is well almost worth the hype owing to the things that you have to explain to yourself rather than let the movie do it for you.<br /><br />The most possible reason for my curiousity for this movie is the amount of ridicule and disappointment people feel for Saw2. This movie was never released in my city but I had to wait and get a dvd from somewhere. It is a 100 minute film and just when your brain starts wondering what is going to happen next it hits with you two or three shocker moments. I must add that the music in the film adds to the tension and strange feeling of admirable awe it arose in me.<br /><br />WHO IS THIS MOVIE FOR?<br /><br />I wouldnt say this movie is for everyone because I am pretty sure a lot of people would find a few flaws and try to explain them to one another. Most people have a "we want to hate a movie" syndrome so it is defintiely not for those looking to ridicule. What really matters is the unique storyline and the sickness behind a brain that wants to teach you a lesson by playing with your life.<br /><br />WHAT WAS WEAK ABOUT THE FILM?<br /><br />The scenes involving the doctor cheating on his wife and the very poor enactment of a fight by the wife just before the doctor is leaving. Also the scene where he is on the laptop trying to look strangely passionate about his work. The detectives were silly too. However, that is about it cause there's a whole lot of WHOA inducing scenes in this suggestive epic of sorts.</p></body></html>

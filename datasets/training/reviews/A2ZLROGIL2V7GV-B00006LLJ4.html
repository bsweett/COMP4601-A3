It's one of those films where you can enjoy it without being the biggest sci-fi enthusiast.  I've admit many times that I'm not the biggest sci-fi buff, but if there's a solid story behind it all, I'm there!  And this film has it all.<p>The movie is set in the future where murder is pre-determined.  That's right, now murders can be stopped before they ever happen.  It's called "Pre-Crime."  It's based on a system involving "Pre-Cogs"  that can see the future and predict when somebody is going to murder someone.  It's supposed to be flawless.  But something goes wrong when the system targets one of their own, Detective John Anderton.  The Pre-Cogs have predicted that he will murder a man that he has never met before.  Now John is on the run, hoping to find out what's going on and if he's been set up, who is behind it all.  The deeper he searches the more twists and secrets come about.<p>Everything about this movie I love.  I love how dark and eerie of a movie it is!  I wasn't expecting that from Spielberg, being that I saw "AI" and thought that while it was a little dark I think he missed an opportunity to get even darker.  "Minority Report" is one of the darkest sci-fi films I have seen in a long time (since "Dark City").  And what I love about it all is that even with out-of-this-world special effects, the movie never loses focus on the story or the characters.<p>The script was absolutely superb.  I've never read the short story that the movie is based upon, but I have to admit I was in awe at every turn.  It has some great acting too.  Tom Cruise was perfect for the role.  Colin Farrell and Max Von Sydow were terrific as well.  Steven Spielberg doesn't miss a note in his directing and I think the movie could've gone wrong if it were in the hands of somebody else.  (I'm just grateful that George Lucas didn't get his hands on this one.)<p>A word of warning; I wouldn't recommend parents letting their little kids see this one.  It gets very dark and disturbing at times.  Don't let the PG-13 rating fool you for a second, I believe that it BARELY made PG-13.  Just a little warning from me.<p>The DVD contains a TON of extras that are bound to keep you happy.  The picture is great (some will complain that it looks all grainy, but that's exactly how it's supposed to look) and the sound is outstanding.  You get the chance to hear it in DTS if your system can play it.  Some of the extras are a bunch of documentaries on the special effects, behind the story and thought, stunts, locations, and a lot more.<p>"Minority Report" is an outstanding film that really does remind me of great dark sci-fi movies like "Blade Runner" and "Dark City."  Combined with action, suspense, drama, and elements of film noir, this movie  proves to be a success on every front.  If you're looking for a great movie, check out "Minority Report" when you can.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Decent Sci-fi film"></head><body><p>I am not a big fan of Science Fiction movies but the Predator is fairly entertaining. It must be around the top of ground breaking films when it comes to the sci-fi library and industry. By the late 80's to early 90's more science fiction movies were being made as technology became more advanced. My favorite sci-fi move to date is T-2, which is a much more well rounded movie than this in my opinion.  Overall if you are a fan of these types of films or one of Schwarzenegger, then think you could enjoy it but for the more casual sci-fi fan look towards some more recent releases for a more well rounded experience.<br /><br />Peter J.

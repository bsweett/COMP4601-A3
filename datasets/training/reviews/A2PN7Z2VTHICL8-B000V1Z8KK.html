<meta name="summary" content=""They killed my dog.""></head><body><p>From director Antoine Fuqua who's created such hits as 'Training Day', 'King Arthur', and 'The Replacement Killers', comes 'Shooter', a high action "guy" flick.<br /><br />Extreme sharp shooter Bob Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is recruited after retirement to aid in foiling the president's assassination.  What he doesn't know is that he's going to be framed for it.  Rookie agent Nick Memphis (Micheal Pena) seems to be the only one who smells fish in this fouled bowl of a coup.  Seems the president wasn't the real target, but an ambassador from Africa with some unknown figures of casualties stemming from the construction of an oil pipeline.<br /><br />Managing to elude the secret service and FBI, Swagger then visits his dead partner's wife Sarah Fenn (Kate Mara) for a little recoup and regroup.  Now he's out to prove his innocence.<br /><br />Look for an excellent performance from Danny Glover as Colonel Isaac Johnson, playing the part of the bad guy.  Also excellent are Rhona Mitra (Hollow Man, Nip/Tuck Season Three) as Alourdes Galindo and Ned Beatty as Senator Charles F. Meachum, another bad guy.<br /><br />There's car chases, blowups, shootouts, homemade IV's, a pretty girl, and all kinds of tense action and puzzling intrigue.  While sticking close to the formula for a "guy" flick, 'Shooter' manages to entertain all with its edgy atmosphere.  Although, I could have done with more 'Sam the dog' than the patented Mark Wahlbery "swagger" in slow motion.  There's a decent plotline, a lot of action, and enough good performances to keep this movie from falling into the flatlands of typical "guy" flicks.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

From the first baritone note of Morgans character you know you are in the presence of a man you like and care about. What other actor could bring so much to his character as Jack Nicholson, whom Morgan Freeman has to ask his loyal assistance(Sean Hayes), is he crazy? Of course, he is, he's Jack, and we love him. Rob Reiner pulls the strings on this serious film with adequate doses of laughs and creates a moving piece. You might know where it's headed but you will find yourself pulled in and unwilling to turn away. The movie tries to answer some lofty questions, is life about whoever has the most toys wins? or is the measure of a man measure by those who measure themsleves by you? It is a moving and enjoyable treat.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="(very) silly fun"></head><body><p>Please note that the 4-star rating is for the film itself. As a Blu-ray disk, it gets /at least/ 5 stars.<br /><br />"The Fifth Element" is one of those films you have to accept on its own terms. It's so silly and has so many off-the-wall elements that the initial viewing can be very off-putting, especially in a story about the possible destruction of humanity. It works best if you shut off your critical and reasoning faculties, and just "go with the flow".<br /><br />Beeson throws in lots of "Star Wars" references, which I'll leave you to note and laugh at on your own. His direction is apt and assured, but some of the acting is not up to par. Ian Holm, in particular, so overplays the priest's discomfort and confusion that it becomes unbelievable. (And in a movie that's fundamentally unbelievable, that's saying something.) On the other hand, Gary Oldman (not surprisingly) gives an imaginative and controlled interpretation of the story's human villain.<br /><br />The real star of this Blu-ray disk is the transfer itself. The image is so razor-sharp and beautifully textured -- without any apparent enhancement artifacts -- that one cannot even /imagine/ a better 1080p transfer. The sound verges on the spectacular, with plenty of surround action.<br /><br />Among high-definition demo disks, "The Fifth Element" is "primer inter pares". If you simply want a disk to show off your new 60" Pioneer Elite Kuro plasma display &lt;ahem> (not to mention your sound system), you couldn't choose better. ("Amadeus" and "2001" are also good choices.)</p></body></html>

Many of the shows and movies that command the #1 (or #2, or #3) spot on TV leave me wondering if I'm some sort of defective for disliking what everyone else apparently adores. For once, I'm a part of the group: I like Lost. It's not the best show I've ever seen, but the productions values are very nice, the plot is interesting, and the characters are likeable without being perfect (morally, at least; physically they are still mostly too pretty for the real world. Which is why they live on TV...but I digress.)<br /><br />Other good things: a willingness to tackle issues most TV shows wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole and a Siberian tiger pushing, an amazing cast, and have I mentioned the writing? The camera work is fantastic! I realy love the cinematography and the flasbacks, for once in a show, are an actual treat which I anticipate instead of the usual filler and annoyances. I love that the intro isn't some 5 minuite music video advertisement, but a 5 second clip of the title - that's so cool it gives me shivvers. And I love the setting. It's lovely.<br /><br />My one fear is that it'll all end in disgusted fans. A show like this must have a fitting end, a conclusion, a finale. You can't keep going just because your ratings are up and people will buy it. You have a plot with mysteries - as every mystery fan knows, there is a time and a place for everything, and all myseries must be solved.<br /><br />So - as much as I love the show - until it ends I'll worry. If they do it right, and end it, then come up with another show with the same high production values and excellent writing the producer and director will have gained a big credit account with me, and I'll be a devoted and trusting fan. If they draw it out and mess it up and get tangled I'll chalk it up as another great idea ruined by shoddy execution and go back to watching my reruns.</p></body></html>

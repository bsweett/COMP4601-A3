How did they expect to do going up against a blockbuster like that?  It is a good film.  It has space battles and a antagonist that would have made a good two part episode.  It's all in the expectations...you are not watching the Matrix when you see a Star Trek movie.  It's about a cast of characters we've been watching for seven seasons and three movies...it's not the loser that critics say it is...</p></body></html>

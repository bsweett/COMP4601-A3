First off, the acting is somewhat decent. The story moves along, making the picture to be watchable. On the other hand, the directing effort, especially by (gee whiz...the name) Pitof is horrendous. The way the scenes were...shot...shot...shot...shot...in an extremely rapid fashion. It's too sophomoric for a director with an infantile, silly name. Moreover, Catwoman depended too much on unnecessary computer graphics work. Less is more. Repeat after me, less is more. Got it? For about an hour or so, there were way too many cheesy scenes, but Catwoman got better thereafter and ends fairly well. I see a lot of potential in Catwoman, and I wouldn't mind if there was a part two. Of course, it's nice to see a picture with very little profanity, but there were too much sexual innuendos thrown in. For example, in poor taste, was basketball sex in front of second graders! Come on, decency is needed. My suggestion to improve Catwoman is to cut out much of the computer graphics work and just let Catwoman be a normal picture. Really, Catwoman is better off that way. I think I would keep the acting and the story intact because it's not bad at all. While maintaining the profanity level at a low level, it would be nice to cut out the cheesiness and keep the sexual stuff, subtle or not, at minimum. Overall, probably, Catwoman would have been much better. Oh yeah...get rid of that lame-name director and get somebody else who knows how to direct and who also has a better name.</p></body></html>

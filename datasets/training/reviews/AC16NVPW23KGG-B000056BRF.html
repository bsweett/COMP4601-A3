The DVD version also includes some rare footage screen test with Leslie Nielson as Masala! Ben Hur is a great film. Like its counterpart TEN COMMANDMENTS(which I actually like better), Ben Hur is hollywood splendor in use of sets, special effects, and cast of a thousands(LITERALLY!) Hopefully, a new generation will experience Ben Hur due to the success of GLADIATOR.  Ben Hur is not just a tale of the Christ. This is a story of one's loyalty tested in tumultous times. The story of Hur and Masala take place during the time of Christ, and that is what makes the film so powerful. While the Roman Empire is at its height, and the conquered Judea is made to be colonial subjects of this empire all the while Christ is walking the earth and &quot;doing his work....&quot;  Soundtrack by Miklos Roza works well on DVD version, and they did leave in the Overture and En'tracte. The old VHS version and some tv versions used to letterbox only the chariot race sequence. I will admit that at times film can be somewhat poky and pretentious, but why carp? This is a brilliant picture with all the epic splendor of a Cecil B. Demille masterpiece(even though he had nothing to do with this !!)I highly recommend this dvd version as it adds to excitement and power to an already incredible piece of cinema(WINNER OF 11 well deserved OSCARS).</p></body></html>

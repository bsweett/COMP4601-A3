<meta name="summary" content="A great movie about boxing hero."></head><body><p>Cinderella Man is the Ron Howard directed movie about Jim Braddock, a depression era boxer who beat the odds to become the heavyweight champion of the world.  Russell Crowe and Rene Zellweger star as Braddock and his wife.  Braddock is an up and coming boxer before losing a fight then losing all his money in the stock market crash of 1929.<br /><br />The movie is its most powerful when portraying the hardships that Braddock must face looking for work.  Their small apartment is a dump, they have no money, and Braddock lives in fear of having to send his kids away to live with relatives.  Braddock continues to lower himself as he applies for welfare then even visits his old boxing buddies to ask for money so he can turn his heat back on.  Braddock's manager, played by Paul Giammatti, gets Braddock another fight against a contender, so Braddock reenters the ring one last time on a days notice.<br /><br />Somehow, Braddock knocks out this contender and the rest of the movie chronicles his rise to the final heavyweight championship bout with Max Baer.  The boxing is realistic and violent and one of the best scenes is after Braddock wins his comeback bout, he stands in the audience, watching Max Baer brutally pummel and taunt an opponent.  This was a good movie, and emotionally uplifting.  The boxing scenes were played for realism, I kept expecting to hear the Rocky music start playing.  Also, there is no scene where his wife inspires him to victory.<br /><br />Cinderella Man is a good movie that men and women will both enjoy.  Being a true story, you won't see the expected twists and turns, but you'll definitely enjoy the film.</p></body></html>

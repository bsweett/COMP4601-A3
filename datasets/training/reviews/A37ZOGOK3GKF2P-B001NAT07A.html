Halle Berry looked hot, I mean red, white, and blue hot in that leather suit, but gave little effort as Patience, her "human" alter-ego.  The stunts were well done, the fight sequences were awesome at times, and Sharon Stone as the villain was purr-fect.  This film is destined to the "Grease 2", "Xanadu," and other camp-o-rama classics hall of fame.  It's so silly at times, you expect to see "BOOM!" "BOP!" accross the screen its almost disappointing you don't.  Still the film is pretty enough to enjoy.  Good rainy afternoon, popcorn entertainment.  Now where did I put my catnip?  Here, Halle Kitty!</p></body></html>

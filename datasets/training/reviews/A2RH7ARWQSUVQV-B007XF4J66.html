<meta name="summary" content="Classic Romance"></head><body><p>It seems I have received a number of negative reviews on my interpretation of this film which is somewhat baffling to me.  In fact I think 'Casablanca' is an excellent film but think its quality--and the quality is indeed superb--is largely a product of editing rather than initial planning.  Surely the actors didn't think that they were involved in anything 'special'.  They thought it was just another studio film being cranked out like tanks or aircraft during WWII.<br /><br />This film was, I believe, released in 1945. Therefore, it is, in some ways, a fairly standard propaganda flick [and there were hundreds of them during the War] saved by the presence of Ingrid Bergman, in all her youthful beauty, and the brooding 'Rick' [Humphrey Bogart].  Bergman's beauty is a thing to behold and Bogart's agony is correspondingly miserable.<br /><br />Rick's 'Club Americain' is in Vichy-French controlled Casa Blanca.  It is also a hot bed for intrigue and desperate people trying to escape Nazi occupied Europe. Rick, who is a successful restrauteur, has settled into an alcoholic haze following his baffling abandonment by the haunting Bergman in Paris a couple of years earlier.  Much to Rick's chagrin and surprise, Bergman shows up unexpectedly--along with her husband--in his North African night club.  Rick immediately sinks into a desperate, alcohol enhanced grief as he waits for Bergman to return and explain herself.  Rick's despair is truly a thing to behold and is why Bogart deserves to be rated as one of the truly great actors.<br /><br />Paul Henreid, as Bergman's cuckolded husband, is just too noble for words and the Nazis are appropriately unidimensional and evil.  The cynical Vichy French Inspector is indeed perfect as a man who ultimately finds where his loyalties...and soul...lies.  "Arrest the usual suspects," he orders, as Bogart, walking away with him in the fog tells him, "I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."  Excellent stuff, really.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Conquest of Mexico</p></body></html>

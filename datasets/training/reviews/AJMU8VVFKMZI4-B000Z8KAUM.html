Nothing in this movie is believable.  Willie Banks should have been on the look out for these guys the minute he thought about crossing Reuben.  No way a man of Danny and Rusty's thieving statures would be able to even walk into a casino.  That town doesn't play.  Despite a weak plot and bad acting Ocean's 13 is nothing more than sleek man candy and I'm glad I didn't pay a dime to see it.</p></body></html>

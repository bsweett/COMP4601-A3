It is a stunning film, a fable of fear and prejudice told with striking visual flair. The haunting shadows and eerie hues of Russell Harlan's camerawork evoke the myths and nocturnal fears of childhood, and Elmer Bernstein's quintessentially American score supplements the imagery well, creating a film laden with atmosphere.<p>Harper Lee's story follows a lawyer (Atticus Finch) who puts himself on the line to defend a black man accused of rape in the 1930s deep south, told through the eyes of his two children, who are on a journey of their own to overcome some lesser prejudices of their own. The young Mary Badham and Philip Alford give excellent performances.<p>The subject matter is bold for the time, and there is little evidence of the kind of bowdlerization that plagued many other films of the same, and an earlier, era. The heart of the film is very simple: It wants very earnestly to show us that prejudice and bigotry are nothing but those childhood fears, borne of ignorance, and resolved by those brave enough to step beyond the barriers, confronting their fears, and, in so doing, finding that differences are nothing to be scared of.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I liked some parts, hated others of it"></head><body><p>I have never seen a movie like Pulp Fiction in that some scenes or parts of the film I loved and some I hated.  Why I am not sure since most films that are shot in or take place in Los Angeles I usually enjoy very much.  I thought the part towards the end with Harvey Keitel in it was great, yet some of the drug scenes were just not interesting.  This movie reminds me of so many other films that are based out of LA like 'crash, from 2005', '2 days in the valley', in how the movie was developed and plays out.  Must be the atmosphere that Los Angeles brings to the movie making process and that it is the nicest place I have ever been to in this country.  Overall, the film is very popular and has a great cast to it.  Maybe a little less drugs for me and I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></body></html>

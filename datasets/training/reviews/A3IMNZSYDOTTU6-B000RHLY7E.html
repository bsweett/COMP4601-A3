<meta name="summary" content="An Absolutely Insane Movie...Brought To You By Rob Zombie..."></head><body><p>When HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES came out, it glorified Rob Zombie's love of B-grade horror flicks while giving an insane twist at the same time. It was a quietly successful film, and many of Zombie's following either loved it or hated it. Most loved it. It was one of the most insane movie experiences of my life. I wasn't sure how this sequel was going to hit me, but I've only got one word for you...INSANE!<br /><br />THE DEVIL'S REJECTS is one hell of an insane film. Rob Zombie shows more as a director here with his unbelievable camera angles and surreal setting (the desert locations worked to good effect). The acting in this movie is also over-the-top. Bill Moseley, Sid Haig, and Sheri Moon Zombie (Rob's real life wife) nail their parts in such convincing manner, you'll start to wonder if they're playing "real" crazy people. But you have to give big credit to William Forsythe, who plays his character with such guts and conviction, he's a believable dirtball, and you'll feel the same throughout the film.<br /><br />We pick up at the home of the Firefly family, who seem to be resting in peaceful slumber for the most part. Little do they know that a full-scale ambush is about to take place, thanks to the law enforcement in the area. When the showdown begins, its violent, the camera moves with the action, and the only two who manage to escape (not counting Mama Firefly, who was captured) are Otis and Baby. They manage to kill off a poor old lady and steal her car, and drive off. Sheri makes contact with Captain Spaulding, the father of the insane family. When they all eventually rendezvous at a hotel, they take some hostages and some insane events begin to unravel. Some of the hostages do not make it, and eventually they have to get out and run off to take refuge in a strip-club type hotel. The intercuts with Mama Firefly are very amusing...and very creepy. But she finally gets her just desserts thanks to the insane sheriff, so now things take an ugly turn. We eventually head back to the scene where everything began, and the one of many near-climaxes begins, with the sheriff going nuts and holding everyone hostage until someone takes a stand...who is it? I wouldn't dream of giving this away, but the ending is just absolutely mindblowing...you will shake you head in disbelief, but you will ultimately have enjoyed this crazy, insane little flick that Mr. Zombie has poured his heart into...for you gluts to enjoy. One of the most insane scenes in the movie has to do with a woman wearing the mask of her...again, can't give it away...but you'll be somehow reminded of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE in a way.<br /><br />THE DEVIL'S REJECTS ups its predecessor in every dimension conceivable, in terms of action, camera-work, and acting. The violence is up there, but the crazy acting just steals the movie. The leads are all terrific, and the movie is just one whole insane experience. If you liked HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES, no doubt you will never view movies the same way again after the zany horror of THE DEVIL'S REJECTS.</p></body></html>

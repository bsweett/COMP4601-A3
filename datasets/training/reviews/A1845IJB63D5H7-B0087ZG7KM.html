<meta name="summary" content="Well balanced comedy, drama, education, and politics."></head><body><p>This is a true American piece of art, characterized by the strong will to criticize ill traits by the least powerful citizens. The least here was a middle class woman struggling with employment, love, separation from her senile mother, and her inability to secure basic living needs. She was being used as sex object by a male wolf, pushed out of her shared residence by similarly struggling aliens who could not afford to pay their share of the rent. Her experience with the abusive male partner tainted her views of all males and rendered her skeptical from people in general. That was the main character that represents the majority of the American people, split between hard social choices and equally tough financial challenges.<br /><br />The main character will then shine in an educational criticism of fellow females whose ill traits served no good cause. The moviemaker chose a not very attractive bride to demonstrate the vanities of squandering money in social setting that strained the financial situation of the family beyond any good reason. The wedding arrangement of such not very attractive female extended from female bachelor party that ended in food poisoning, to group travel to Las Vegas that ended to detention and arrest of the main character, to an extravagant shower party that ended in manic episode of destruction and upset, etc.<br /><br />Along the many events stretched through the wedding arrangement, the underlying struggles of main character are compared to the ongoing vanities of the wedding events.<br /><br />The choice of characters was flawless, and the comparative alternation between the substantial human struggle with basic living needs versus the nonsensical waste of squandering money on nonessential formalities, luxury, food, dress, and travel,was brilliant.<br /><br />The movie started with provocative sexual play, followed by female sexual innuendo that might have been thrown in there based on a money making decision, it yet excludes the movie from being used as an educational material to younger age groups.</p></body></html>

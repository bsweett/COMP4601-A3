<meta name="summary" content="Old-school..."></head><body><p>This is an old-school horror...<br /><br />Lots of gore, the goriest horror film I've seen in a long time. Almost comparable to the Evil Dead.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like either the Nighmare on Elm Street series (I do not) or the Friday 13th series (I do) this is one one those slashers that has a small plot, but if you like the style of the others, then this movie is for you.<br /><br />Also, if you like new horror films on high budgets, this is also for you.<br /><br />Just dont get it expecting a classic!<br /><br />Overall, a good final battle. A sequel is almost inevitable...</p></body></html>

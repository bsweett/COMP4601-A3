<meta name="summary" content="A Horror Classic."></head><body><p>Even though it seems cheesy, even laughable today, there's no denying "The Evil Dead" is still a landmark moment in the horror genre. Made for virtually no budget by a group of struggling young filmmakers straight out of college, "The Evil Dead" became one of the most original films in the horror genre as well as films in general, and is still vastly entertaining today.<br /><br />Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) and his friends have gone upstate to rent a cabin in the woods. Everything seems well at first until they find the so called Book Of The Dead, which is supposed to unleash unspeakable evil. That unspeakable evil is manages to one by one, turn each cabin dweller into mindless, bloodthirsty zombies, until Ash is the only one left standing.<br /><br />The plot is pretty much that, but it's still a thrill to watch. The death scenes are both hilarious and creative, and the performances are great, especially Campbell, who became a cult icon thanks to his performance as Ash.<br /><br />This new special edition comes with a wealth of special features, including audio commentary from the stars and the crew (including director Sam Raimi), and crystal clear sound and picture quality.<br /><br />An absolute must have.</p></body></html>

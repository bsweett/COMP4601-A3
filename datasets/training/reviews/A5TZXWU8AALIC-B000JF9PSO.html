<meta name="summary" content="Truly Evil Monsters and Everyday Heroes"></head><body><p>This is not an easy film to watch and yet it felt important to make myself do it.  I agree with every review here that says that everyone needs to see this.  We have to remember.  We have to understand that even though we've all gone back to our normal lives (those who are lucky enough to do that), these monsters are still out there, still plotting to kill the rest of us, still hating with every fiber of their being.<br /><br />They see us as evil.  Imagine what their movie would look like if they made one from THEIR point of view.  The passengers on United 93 would have horns and tails and be engaged in orgies and child sacrifice before the brave hijackers took the vile plane to the ground.<br /><br />That's how they see us and that's why they dedicate themselves to kill us.  That reality should overshadow all political posturing.<br /><br />But this film simply tries to recreate what happened on September 11th, 2001.  And it's far more disturbing than any overblown propaganda or Hollywood melodramatics.  This happened.<br /><br />We must never forget.</p></body></html>

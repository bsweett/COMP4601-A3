More entertaining than one would expect from another video-game adaption, but the visual effects are so laughably poor and the concept so ridiculous that most die-hard horror fans will see this to be a direct rip-off of George A. Romero&#65533;s zombie films. Ten points to anyone who can figure out Jovovich&#65533;s character&#65533;s name before the credits.</p></body></html>

Among other passengers on the ship are a tough captain (Radha Mitchell), a drug addicted cop (Dazed & Confused's Cole Hauser), and some other characters played by Keith David and Farscape's Claudia Black.  When the ship crashes on an uncharted planet, the surviving passengers are forced to band together to survive against the planet's indigenous vicious creatures.  The plot and storyline are far from original, but the excellent acting (including the surprisingly well acted role by Diesel) and superb directing from David Twohy (The Arrival) make Pitch Black a high grade B movie that is a great guilty pleasure.</p></body></html>

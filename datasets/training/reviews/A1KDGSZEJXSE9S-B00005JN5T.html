<meta name="summary" content="Another failed sequel"></head><body><p>You know, I actually didn't think the first one was<br /><br />all that funny, but this one failed badly. Why? Well,<br /><br />it was predictable. The most funny parts came from the<br /><br />little boy and the animals. The adults in this movie<br /><br />all sucked.... Ben's wife looked like she is on drugs<br /><br />and "The Fockers" were very unfunny.<br /><br />They should have gave bigger roles to the animal and<br /><br />used the kid alittle more because they gave what little<br /><br />fun there actually was. Didn't think this film should<br /><br />have had a part 2 anyway.... Should have left it alone.<br /><br />But Hollywood just couldn't resist could they? Blah!</p></body></html>

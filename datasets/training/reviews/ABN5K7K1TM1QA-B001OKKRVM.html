<meta name="summary" content="Emotionally compelling, gorgeous and epic"></head><body><p>The penguins are exquisite.  They almost look unreal they are so precisely sculptured and painted, their graceful bills sliced from the dark rim of the moon, their red and black lines like something from a designer of fine tuxedos, their round, dough-boy bodies with their flippers like little wings, their stoic non-expressiveness otherworldly and heroic.<br /><br />The desolate and forbidding Antarctic landscape with its immovable walls of blue-white ice and its black, rocky outcrops and the great blue and black sky above is awesome and awe-inspiring, beautiful and frightening, clearly another world as distant from our experience as another planet.<br /><br />And the story of the seventy-mile trek away from the ocean in which the penguins are so wondrously at home, where they fly through the water like something propelled, quicker than cats in their pudgy streamlined costumes, where they are expert and gluttonous fishers of fish, is nothing short of epic.  At first they march together (and glide when they can over the ice like snowmen on their bellies), male and female to the place of their birth seventy miles inland, taking tiny child-like steps.  And then they pair off and mate (the graceful courtship shown, the actual mating tastefully framed so that what we see is no more graphic than shared hugs), and then, as they stand huddled in a great mass against the wind and cold, the fertilized egg develops within the female and at length the egg is laid.<br /><br />And here the story becomes especially instructive for modern human parents.  The egg is carefully, oh, so carefully and with some haste transferred from the feather-covered warmth of the mother's pouch to that of the father's.  The transfer must not be careless or too slow because the fierce Antarctic cold will freeze the egg and the chick within in seconds.  Then the mother leaves her mate and her egg behind and begins the trek back to the ocean so that she can eat once again, and can return with rich, oily, protein-packed food from her belly to regurgitate to the chick that will be born in her absence.<br /><br />Meanwhile the fathers stand together in their living mass against the cold and wind and snow, rotating in some semi-automatic manner so that each penguin spends some time on the periphery of the mass and sometime in the warm interior.  And they do not eat.  Months go by, and they do not eat.  Finally the eggs begin to hatch and the chicks are born.<br /><br />And now the time for the mothers to return is nigh.  And the chicks peer out of their downy pouches as though looking for their mothers, and they chirp.  The fathers grow worried (I imagine) as they wait for the mothers to return and feed the hungry chicks.  Each father has exactly one egg.  Those who lost their eggs or never had an egg have left to return to the sea and to fish.  When things get very desperate, the fathers exude from their mouths a little bit of mysterious white nourishment, enough to last the chick for a day or two, a crucial day or two.<br /><br />And then at long last the mothers return, one at a time in a line from over the horizon they come.  And how welcome we can imagine they are!<br /><br />So this is a very human story, a story of monogamous parents who give everything they have to their progeny, whose struggles against the elements (and quick and hungry leopard seals in the sea) remind us of our own, except that ours seem relatively tame and not nearly as onerous.<br /><br />It is a gorgeous movie, best seen on a big screen of course with a beautiful score, a film that might be a little too emotionally demanding for small children, but one that will surely captivate older children and their parents.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

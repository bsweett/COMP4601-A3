Actually, it's more like an alternate timeline, since "The Hunt for Red October" takes place in the late 80s and this one takes place in 2002. But no matter. This film is deliciously good with all the propor Clancy elements in tact. Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) is an up-and-coming CIA analyst who stumbles on a plot to nuke Baltimore all too late. Morgan Freeman plays Cabot, Ryan's mentor and friend. The film never loses itself with technical jargon, something the Clancy novel does. Instead, it gives a good story about characters, governments, and mayhem on the verge of World War III. "The Sum of All Fears" is a fun movie for the military buff or Clancy fan.</p></body></html>

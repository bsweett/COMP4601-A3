Two teens are on their way home on an isolated country road when almost run off the road by an old beat up, yet cool, truck. Thinking they have seen the last of this truck and the crazy person driving it, they continue on their journey only to pass in front of an old church where they see the same beat up truck and someone who seems to be throwing a body down a large sewer pipe. They decide to investigate and when one of them falls down the sewer pipe, he discovers a den of horror. Now being seen by the killer, they must run for their lives. This movie delivers in both horror and gore. Not a boring movie and well acted. I recommend any horror movie fan at least rent this movie if you have not seen it yet.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Clint Eastwood knows how to make a movie..."></head><body><p>It didn't surprise me that Clint Eastwood directed "Unforgiven", good as it was, because he is obviously well steeped in the legend and lore of the Western.  He has done a fine job with several other films as well, but in Mystic River Clint signals a full maturity in his gift as a director.<p>He began with a stellar cast, and I won't waste anyone's time being the ten millionth person to praise Sean Penn's stunning performance.  A cast that breathes life into this sorrowful tale surrounds him.  Tim Robbins returns on-screen in a role that is perhaps the most difficult and complex one of the movie, and he seems believable every moment.  Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne make good cop-partners.  The wives of Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are played by Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden, and they are both heart-breakingly good.  <p>None of us are perfect, and this is a theme that runs through this story of abuse, suffering and death.  We are perhaps least perfect when we let our passions rule us and we go off half-cocked when things would probably turn out better if we had our emotions and facts straight.  Many things are not quite as they seem.  <p>There are many virtuoso sequences in the film as two simultaneous events are juxtaposed upon each other.  Note snippets of visual information we are given in the early sequence that alternates between the first communion of one of Sean Penn's daughters, and the crime scene investigation where the police will eventually discover that the eldest daughter has been murdered.  Note also later on the climactic confrontation between Sean Penn and Tim Robbins on the banks of the Mystic River while at the same time Bacon and Fishburne confront the former boyfriend of the dead daughter.<p>This film leaves you with a little pit in your stomach.  But it does that with consummate skill, and I admire it for that.  I watched the movie first in the theater, then last night on DVD.  I pose this question to viewers:  After the events of the end of the movie, what do you think is the response of the Laurence Fishburne character?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Welcome to Crossroads mall"></head><body><p>Where this is the last place to hid from blood-thirsty zombies.  Dawn of the dead is a remake, just like The grudge, Texas Chainsaw Massacere, ect.  But unlike the Grudge and texas chainsaw massacere, in my mind it's a very good sequal, but despite how hard it tries(And believe me, this movie did put effort into it) It just didn't have the magic the original had(Maybe it's because I seen the 1st and expected to much out of this one).<br /><br />This movie stars Sarah Polley who is a nurse who has a nightmae, only to find out that(GASP!!!  OH NOO!!)It's not a nightmare.  It's for-jorkin' real, and everthing is about to get real messy. She then runs into a cop(Ving Rhames) with a big shotgun ann in her face like the media to a celeberty.  When they're cool with eachother, they run onto a everyday guy(Jake Weber) and one bad man with a berreta a pregnat woman(Mekhi Phifer).  The only place left for these band of people is the mall.  But security gaurds are there as well, but insted of help them, they wanna give them the finger, that's until they come up with a messed up truce, and believe me, at a time like that, it's messed up like a totaled car.<br /><br />The one thing I loke about this movie is, no boring introduction, no long tedious explanation, it cuts to the chase like a Cheetah.  You see blood and gore a few minutes in as the movie begins.  The plotline is pretty simple, like it's predissecor, so not much new on the plotline.  You get infected you gotta die.  And the change from slow moving able to walk byable Zonbies to the 28 days later style, try to run without a gun, and you'll get iced kind.  Presents more fear.<br /><br />This movie also has quite a bit of realisim in it.  Like if you wanna live, sometimes you just gotta say to a friend that's dead, better you than me.  And man it shows how loves not only blind but stupid and demented.(I mean seriously why risk my life for one who's already undead and affected.)  But hey, they say love is pain, and pain hurts, and so doeas love.<br /><br />One thing I couldn't stand about this movie is that it has some annoying cliche's ,and stupid stuff in it.  Like most of the protagonists being young people(Seen that in horror films for the past........... jeez I can't remember).  Videotaping sex, while Zombies are outside(Either they're enjoying their last moments, or just don't realize they're in danger.  Having that in the movie was pretty much uneeded and stupid)  Forshadowing(I mean, when the main forshadow is first mentioned, I saw it comming, then it comes, and it's just too expected.)  And dull emotional horse-crap.  I'm serious the ending is so old, it makes Al Pacino looks like he can be in a porno flick.  And like I said love hurts, but in this movie, it feels like every other fake Hollywood crap that makes you wanna say O what and I care.<br /><br />Altho what I couldn't stand, and that crappy ending made my review a 3 stars, everything else before the ending was excellent, but, to me, it's usally the ending that makes a movie.  Why do you think Shawshank Redemption left you with a pleasing end.  Man, I wish more films today would work on endings, but this is definitly a worthy gorefest of a sequal.  I wanna try to get the uncut version, cuz I'm pretty sure it's goryier than what I saw on Starz.<br /><br />peace</p></body></html>

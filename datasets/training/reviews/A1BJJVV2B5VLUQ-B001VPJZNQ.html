Prior to viewing - what are your expectations? You can look at this movie in two ways: One - as a big blockbuster action flick with the WWF's &quot;The Rock&quot; and all kinds of incredible fight scenes, an incredible story, bombs going off, and the bad guys getting what they deserve. Or two, have no expectations at all. I feel that if you go into &quot;The Rundown&quot; with high expectations thinking Dwayne Johnson will be the next &quot;Terminator&quot;, &quot;Commando&quot;, or &quot;Predator&quot;... you might be let down. However, I went into this movie with NO expectations. I've never been a fan of the WWF and the only thing I've seen The Rock in was the &quot;Mummy Returns&quot; (and was unimpressed with him and his claymation double). I watched some of the behind-the-scenes features before the actual movie and was pleasantly surprised at the Rock's smarts, athleticism, (Hawaiian) charsima and sense of humor. I never knew the Rock was such a smart, let alone a funny guy. As for co-star Seann William Scott - he remained true to his other well known characters...a bit obnoxious and often funny at times. The other shock in this movie was director Peter Berg. I had no idea this guy could direct! I only remember Berg from Copland (&quot;Joey&quot;), and probably more so as Corky Romano's illiterate brother &quot;Paulie&quot;. Don't look for an incredible plot here; &quot;The Rundown&quot; is a very simple story. &quot;Beck&quot; (The Rock) is a &quot;Professional Retriever&quot; or bounty hunter. He wants to retire from the mobster for whom he works for and with his last big pay-off, open a restaurant where he can be the chef. The mobster's son &quot;Travis&quot; (Scott) is deep in the jungles of South America and is mixed up with some of the wrong people (namely &quot;Hatcher&quot;, played nicely by Christopher Walken). It's Beck's job to bring Travis back home to Los Angeles. The trip home is a long one and there's some great action, explosions, jeeps going off the road and the stars tumbling down a mountain side, fight scenes, monkeys going ape, etc. The opening scene (prior to Beck hitting the jungles) takes place in Los Angeles. Beck has to confront a football quarterback with a betting problem. As Beck walks into the night club he passes many people (one being Arnold Schwarzenegger in his shortest movie role ever). Beck finds the QB, but he's surrounded by his entire offensive line (and they're huge). The QB won't cooperate, and Beck whists thru these larger-than-life guys one by one while the strobe lights flicker and the music blazes... a great scene! Only thing out of reach in this movie was some of the stunts where you just knew the actors in the fight scenes were on &quot;wires&quot;. Sure, they were fun to watch, but you knew they were physically impossible - even for The Rock. Go into this movie expecting nothing and you'll get much more out of this movie. I was entertained... I found &quot;The Rundown&quot; had a good pace (I never looked down at my watch), plenty of action, great fights, some good stunts, and good dialogue between the characters (humorous and not).</p></body></html>

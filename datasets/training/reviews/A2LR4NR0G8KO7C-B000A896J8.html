Everyone who even has the slightest historical knowledge knows, that the cristian knights butchered all Arabs that weren't willing to accept their religious thoughts. And what do we see here? The cristians are nothing but good guys that mean no harm and the Arabs are like the indians from Dances with Wolves: humble, brave and sophisticated men with a noble code of honour.<br /><br />The only villains in the movie are the Templars that are looking for a holy war. To achieve this they murder some innocent Arabs for no reason...so this way giving the peaceful Arabs a reason to start to fight. This movie clearly tries to build a bridge between the Western and the Eastern civilization, but fails hopelessly as it is not telling the truth.(SARR)</p></body></html>

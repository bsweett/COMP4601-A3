<meta name="summary" content="Never Again!!!"></head><body><p>There is an absolute truism about the Nazi Holocaust: we must never forget and our slogan must be "never again." So to, this movie reminds us that we must never forget the holocaust that was Rawanda in 1994. Since, in Rawanda, it did happen again, the pledge the world made after Hitler's holocaust, has not been kept. In this movie, we are subtly reminded of something: that we acted against the genocide in the Balkins but, we all but abandoned Rawanda. Nick Nolte, who plays the head of a UN peacekeeping group, tells the manager of a five star hotel, Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle) that the world is abandoning Rawanda because the victims are black. Nolte uses spicy language, including the "N word" to drive home this stark point.<br /><br />Initially, Paul wants to protect his family but, as all foreign guests are evacuated from Rawanda, Paul takes in 1,200 refuge from the vicious civil war in which members of an ethnic group, the Tutsis are being slaughtered by the Hutus. Paul is a Hutu and he takes in both Tutsis and Hutus. He resorts to bribery, cajolery, the good offices of the UN, and anything else he can grasp at to save the refugees. He risks his own life on several occasions and at times, he seems almost defeated when he breaks down from the sight of the piles of slaughtered bodies. It is truly an attempt at ethnic cleansing, as the Hutus target Tutsi children so that the ethnic group can be permanently cut off.<br /><br />This movie shows the horrors of genocide in which the targets of the genocide are dehuminized. We constantly hear the maniacal rantings of a Hutu radio announcr referring to the Tutsis as "cockroaches" and the situation seems hopeless. However, just as in Schindler's list, out of hopelessness arose hope and, indeed a small victory, so too, in this movie, we end our view of the horrors uplifted.</p></body></html>

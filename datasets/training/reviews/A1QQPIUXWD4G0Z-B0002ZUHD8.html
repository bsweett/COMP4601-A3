<meta name="summary" content="The Real King Arthur?"></head><body><p>A rather mediocre attempt at bringing to light the mythological origins of King Arthur undermined by a pathetic script and horrible screenplay. In addition, the history portrayed in the film is tentative at best and most historians studying the Arthurian myth wouldn't be so hasty to draw the conclusions presented in the film.<br /><br />First, in terms of the film itself, it was rather mediocre. The plot is a standard Hollywood formula of that is completely predictable in the first 5 minutes of the film. The script was simply indicative reciting the obvious in addition to gratuitous jingoisms where the characters yell 'freedom!', 'liberty!', 'our rights!', etc. I didn't know Arthur was Thomas Jefferson. Although the film quality was very good, the editing wasn't that great and rather generic: overly long scenes showing the Saxons marching like Nazis (just to remind you that they're the bad guys) with their chief whose just a Hitler-like character who wants to exterminate everything (just to remind you he's the arch-villain.) The actors didn't seem very thrilled about their script and just recited what was given to them on paper without much enthusiasm. I give credit to the battle scenes though, they were rather good: especially the one on the frozen lake. One final weak point is that one can clearly see this film's cheap attempts at capitalizing on Riddley Scott's superior 'Gladiator' with similar editing for the battle scenes and almost identical music: hardly a mark of creativity on the part of those who worked on/marketed this film.<br /><br />As for the historical theories proposed in the film, don't be deceived by D.H. Franzoni's commentary about the research involved in this film as the theories he relies on have many flaws that simply don't add up. In terms of historical accuracy, the film is correct in showing that, as most historians now believe, Arthur was a Celt-Roman leader in Britain who lived during the collapse of the Western Roman Empire c.450-475 A.D. and, that he led a military/political movement to fight off the increasing migrations of Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, that were coming to Britain from modern-day Denmark and northern Germany. Contrary to D.H. Franzoni's claim, Lucius Artorius Castus is not a likely candidate as historical evidence places him under Marcus Aurelius/Commodus' reign c. 180 A.D.: 270 years before Arthur is commonly accepted as having existed. In addition to that improbability, the claim that the Holy Grail, The Lady of the Lake, etc. are undoubtedly the product of Sarmatian culture is false and a product of pure conjecture. The Holy Grail is a Christian symbol that had been around for 450 years in the Roman Empire and such symbols were introduced to Britain and Ireland by evangelists such as St. Patrick. Dragons, Merlin, The Lady of the Lake, and Excalibur, is stronger evidence of Celtic/Druidic rites than anything else; also, if members of Arthur's entourage were Sarmatian, why do they all have Celtic/Roman/Germanic names such as Artorius, Ulfius, Galahad, Tristan, Gawayne, Uther, Vortigen, Morgana, Mordred, etc., etc., etc. All of the characters in Arthurian myth have Celtic, Roman, or Germanic names: not Sarmatian ones. Legends of the Green Knight in Arthurian myth have little to do with Sarmatians and more to do with Celtic mythology. In addition, most of the battles, forts, and characters of Arthurian myths are recited as being in Wales and southern England which is where most of the myths come from, not Scotland where Hadrian's wall is located: presumably there's a reason for that. It is also important to note that most of the Celtic revival and geopolitical expansion at that time was focused in southern Britain and Brittany in northern France as evidenced by multiple Celtic settlements and forts: not Northern England as shown in the film.<br /><br />Again, this film is rather mediocre in terms of its screenplay and acting while its script is rather pathetic in terms of its generic dialogues. The film has some good battle scenes. This may be a good movie to rent but, in my opinion, it's not worth owning. The only good Arthurian film in my opinion is John Boorman's 'Excalibur' as it cleverly combines the Romantic tale with Celtic mythology to bring a strange image of surrealism that works quite well for this genre.  The films 'First Knight' and 'Merlin' are the epitome of bad film and you're better off with this film instead.  Finally, for a more cautious historical approach to the Arthurian myth I would recommend Geoffrey Ashe's book 'The Discovery of King Arthur' in addition to the writers recommeded by D.H. Franzoni to get a balanced view on the many theories as to who Arthur may have been.</p></body></html>

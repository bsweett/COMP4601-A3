<meta name="summary" content="One of the all time best science horror pictures."></head><body><p>For those who have read other reviews by yours truly, this will be review, but I divide science fiction into three categories:  true science fiction, science fantasy, and science horror.  Often, science horror could be called true science fiction, because it is based on what could happen.  However, true science fiction is focused more on the possibilities and human reaction, while the purpose of a science horror movie is to terrify you.  This movie will terrify you.<br /><br />This movie does an excellent job with its twists and turns in the plot; you will jump at least once by the time the movie is over.  Schwarzenegger is excellent as the villain, and Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn turn in good performances.  It also has a small role by Beth Motta, who I remember as being an exercise instructor for 20 Minute workout, an exercise program.<br /><br />One challenge in science fiction is dealing with time travel into the past.  This successfully achieves that goal.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A bold new direction for Scorcese, but needs some polishing"></head><body><p>I have said this before and I will say it again. If it wasn't for Kevin Costner, 'Goodfellas' would have recieved the best picture honor in 1990. Martin Scorcese for the past 20 years has given us some of the most meorable movies of our generation. They have a very similar theme and tend to use the same actors as well. Now, we are given 'Shutter Island', which is a step away from the usual and giving us something fresh.<br /><br />I had no idea that this film was based on a comic book, but seeing the trailers and knowing how well DiCaprio works with Scorcese I was very eagar to see how this movie turned out. The movie was a good watch, but there were a few flaws to it. Still, I don't want to rip this film because this was a brave move by Scorcese. He decided to break the usual mafia mold and give us a psychological thriller. We do have the Scorcese elements such as the large amount of 'F' bombs and the whole 1950s/1960s gangster/detective vibe which he loves to do. Still, The acting was great, especially in the every end when the truth about Shutter Island was revield. DiCaprio's performace throughout the movie was good, but bland at times until the very end. His character took a huge twist and the dramatic turn her took was just incredible it made up for the last hour and a half. The movie I felt was too predictable. I pretty much figured out what was going on about half way into the movie. As a whole package it was definitely something new from a director who's work I enjoy.<br /><br />My thoughts on 'Shutter Island', take the time to see it. It was a new step in Martin Scorcese's career I would love to see if he intends to continue trying new genres of film. While predictable it is still enjoyable.</p></body></html>

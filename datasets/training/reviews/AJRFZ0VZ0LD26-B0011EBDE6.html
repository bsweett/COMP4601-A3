<meta name="summary" content="Family bond and the meaning of spirituality"></head><body><p>Touching film that is difficult to put in a particular genre.  It is quiet comedy, reflection on American consumerism, meditation on meaning of family and quest for spirituality.  We meet three brothers who have not seen each other for a year, since the funeral for their father who died in a car accident.  Their mother never comes to the funeral and for all of the brothers this event seems to be a culmination of the prolonged family disfunction.  They are almost like boy-men who cope with their inadequacy in their own way:  eldest one (Francis - Owen) almost kills himself in motorcycle accident, middle one (Peter - Brody) collects material things: his deceased father's glasses, keys, belt; while the youngest one, a pretentious writer who speakes poor French in spite of living in Paris (Jack - Schwartsman) sleeps with anything that is female and still moving.  I like the metaphor that director Wes Anderson uses for the brothers.  They travel across beautiful Indian landscape with so much luggage that they require three porters and a car to carry it.  The luggage itself is no less but Louis Vuitton designed by Mark Jacobs.  As the film progresses and comes to its closure, all three manage to release themselves from the baggage and their dysfunctions turn into sincere brotherly love for each other.  They no longer need to medicate themselves with cigarettes, Indian caugh drops and pain killers.  They have each other and they finally trust each other.  Wonderful cast, music and scenery.  Film moves slowly and has fragments that connect past with the character's present.  Heartwarming movie with support cast of Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray.</p></body></html>

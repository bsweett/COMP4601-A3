<meta name="summary" content="Farfetched throughout but is entertaining at times"></head><body><p>I would not say this is a good movie or a bad movie it's in the middle so it's an ok film. The movie is an adventure film so it's farfetched throughout the movie. Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey is looking for a Confederate ironclad ship that impossibly might have ended up in the desert. Soon he and his faithful sidekick Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) are lost in another adventure, discovering a deadly contaminate being tracked by a beautiful doctor (Penelope Cruz). The story about the confederate ship is good and entertainign it's the story about the poison in the water that is boring. If they would of sticked with finding the ship it would of been a really good movie. The movie is so predictable and funny at times for example they find Penelope Cruz in a well out of the whole desert as if but it's a movie. The movie is entertaining and it's pretty good at times for me to recomand.</p></body></html>

Was the final match up between the two most famous serial killers in film history worth it?. You better believe it. If you are a fan who grew up on these movies in the 80's, then the release of this film is like Christmas. Freddy Krueger(once again played by Robert Englund), is losing power. The children of Elm Street are no longer dreaming, thanks to the drugs they are being fed, and no long suffer from nightmares. What is a psycho killer to do?. Get help via another psycho killer. Freddy enlists the help of Camp Crystal Lake Killer Jason Voorhees(this time played by veteran stuntman Ken Kirzinger), to come to Springwood and cause mayhem and terror so that the kids will once again be afraid and start to dream again. But Jason begins to like his new turf and no longer wishes to be Freddy's puppet. The main heroine is Lori Campbell(Monica Keena), who just happens to live in Freddy's old house on 1428 Elm St. Although, it is so obviously NOT the original house used in all the previous Freddy films. She, along with her boyfriend Will(Jason Ritter), and many friends, are the unlucky ones caught in the crossfire. Most of the teen's own seperate stories are not interesting enough to carry the film. They are okay to watch, but could of been more fleshed out. It doesn't help any that most of the acting from them was pretty stilted. Ordinary at best. Monica Keena, while a beautiful thing to look at, desperatley needed more honed acting chops to do this role justice. Destiny's Child member Kelly Rowland, was one of the better ones of the bunch. Who knew?!. The whole section with Lori and Will and that storyline would of been so much better if there was a little more time spent on it. There is a lot of talk about what happened, but it all seems to be played out as just a lightweight thing to pass the time to get to the battle. It's not bad, but it distracts from the main narrative when it came close to being something rather good. Robert Englund is, once again, brilliant. This is classic Freddy. The look of the make-up and the sweater and the attitude was more reminiscent of the first 3 'Nightmare' film, than any of the latter ones. The wait to see Freddy again was worth it because Englund delivers brilliantly. No offense to Kane Hodder, but Ken Kirzinger really ruled as Jason. He was strong and a big presence. His Jason had a more subtle touch to it than the zombie like ogre presented in the last few 'Friday' films. A touch more humanity as well. This is one of the better representations of the character, if not the best, in any incarnation. Sorry Kane. The film definitley seemed to praise all of the traits that made up 80's slasher films. Nudity, [love], drugs, and rock and roll. It is all there in all it's unabashed glory. Although, the nudity really is brought to the film by the 'Friday' relation. The movie has barely started before these traits are thrown on the silver screen and we couldn't be happier about it. This is a movie that knows what it is and what fans of each franchises' like and want to see. The methods of murder are quite cool, and the body count is on par with any typical Jason film, although quite high for a film that Freddy is in. The movie will also please gorehounds because it is incredibly bloody. I have not seen such a bloody movie in a long time. It's a slasher movie all the way. The movie goes along with a real nice pace. There are signs that the movie may of been edited unfairly and that some scenes were cut off too early, but it has a good flow. It is certainly longer than most of the slasher flicks in the last several years, and you can tell. I enjoyed that a lot. The end battle scene is one for the record books. It is one of the most highly enjoyable moments on screen this year, if not the most. If you are a fan, you will be mesmerized and clapping with glee. One wishes it went on even longer and came up with even more inventive ways to torture and fight each other. As for the ending, well, it wasn't what I was expecting. I didn't really know what to expect, actually, but I was looking for something else. The balance of both films' traits are mostly well done, but at times it doesn't seem to fit. The 'Nightmare' films were several rungs above "Friday' on the horror ladder. They were a bit more classy and intelligent, so it seems kind of odd to see such female nudity and buckets of blood drenched about. But it was cool. Some people miss the point when they say it should of been Jason Vs. Michael. As much as I love Michael as well, it would just be two pieces of indestructible granite pounding each other. With Freddy, you get more than just hitting. You get special effects and so many different things to do that can take the film, and story, to heights that could never happen with just two people like Jason and Michael. People don't get that.  Director Ronny Yu is a brilliant visionary. The movie is very sharp looking and crystal clear. He makes the most of every shot. Whenever there is a moment for something really cool or grisly, he doesn't come up short. The man is incredible. I was blown away with this film. I had a great time. The best thing to come out of the genre in ages. I give you my word. I was laughing(intentionally), cheering, and having a great time. The pairing of the two came across in a film that is undoubtedly entertaining, grisly, and over the top fun. You will have to see it more than once.</p></body></html>

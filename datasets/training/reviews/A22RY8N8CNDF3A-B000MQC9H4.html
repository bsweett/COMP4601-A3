I thought that the part with the 91 year old Eli Walach was one of the bright moments to enjoy.<br /><br />The two female romantic leads are Cameron Diaz (a southern California advertising VIP that creates movie trailers) and Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) an English wedding column writer who lives in a quaint cottage in the English countryside.<br /><br />They both need a break from the men who complicate their lives.  By chance both Amanda and Iris find each other through an Internet site that specializes in home exchanges for short-term get-a-ways.  Amanda and Iris are thousands of miles away from each other but both are excited to change homes and cross continents to move into each other's homes for two weeks.<br /><br />Iris lands in Amanda's Los Angeles home, and Amanda lands in Iris's English cottage.<br /><br />Each young woman has a eye-opening adventure and learn of new and deep relationships in their unfamiliar settings.<br /><br />Iris helps Arthur (Eli Wallach) who is a screenwriter from Hollywood's golden days.  He has her watch movies of strong female lead and Iris helps him find the confidence to face his past and accept some praise from his peers.  Iris also finds true love in Los Angeles (Jack Black).<br /><br />Amanda meets Iris's handsome brother (Jude Law) as he comes knocking at the cottage door.  She learns that he is a widower with two small children, and discovers that even though she does not want to risk vulnerability, she finds love and trust to ask for the family she wants.</p></body></html>

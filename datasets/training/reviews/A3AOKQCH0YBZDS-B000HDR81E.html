Both Aniston's character and Vaughn's character met, fall in love, and buy a condo together.<br /><br />Aniston's character grows tired of carrying the weight of the relationship and being the one who puts in all the work into planning get togethers with friends and family, housework, and always doing activities that Vaughn's character wants to do. When Aniston's character tries to get Vaughn's character engaged in the relationship his character has every excuse why he can't be more involved OR simply doesn't understand where she's coming from, which forces Aniston's character to break off the relationship. She really doesn't want to end the relationship, just make Vaughn's character realize what a good thing he has with her.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Aniston's character's tactics back fire and the two of them  are forced to sell their condo and part ways despite Vaughn's character's attempts in the end to win Aniston's character back again..... The little to late saying certainly applies here.<br /><br />Good acting on the part of the cast members and good story line with a mixture of both comedy and drama make this movie a winner!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The magic of Disney..."></head><body><p>The wonderful thing about `Tangled' is that it instantly calls to mind the glory days of Disney, the years that followed the glorious `The Little Mermaid' and led into `Beauty and the Beast'; two of the greatest animated films of all time.  Yes, `Tangled' is bursting at the seams with love, danger, charm and MUSIC!  With infectious songs that swell in the heart, `Tangled' revisits the days of old, the days when Disney made us feel all warm and cuddly on the inside.<br /><br />`Tangled' makes my heart feel super happy.<br /><br />Taking the classic story of Rapunzel and giving it a facelift, `Tangled' tells the poetic tale of a beautiful young princess named Rapunzel who is kidnapped and locked away in a hidden tower by the evil Mother Gothel, a woman who uses Rapunzel's magical golden hair to stay young forever.  Over the years, Rapunzel dreamed of leaving the tower, hoping to see the beautiful lanterns the filled the sky every year on her birthday, but her mother (err, abductor) refused to let her leave, stating that her hair was too valuable and that outsiders would try to take advantage of her.  Remaining in the tower at all times was her only protection from the evils of the outside world.  Rapunzel's whole world is turned upside down the day she meets the thief, Flynn Rider.  Fresh off of stealing a royal crown, Flynn winds up hiding out in the tucked away tower that houses our young princess, and with a little persuasion, Rapunzel is able to get Flynn to agree to take her to see the lanterns.  Obstacles abound and life lessons are learned, with spunk and charm and a whole lot of beauty dripping from every frame (OMG this movie is a CGI dreamsticle).<br /><br />While the overall lay of the plot may be a bit conventional (especially concerning the `love' story angle), there is so much excitement to be found in this animated gem that one can't help but fall in love with it.  The voice work is astonishing (YES, THEY CAN ALL SING) and the emotional connection is certainly felt.  Happy endings are what Disney was made for, and they deliver a magical one that will make anyone smile.  Each scene is laid out with the viewer in mind, creating gorgeous backdrops to plop our cast of characters in, and each character certainly has a life all their own; even Maximus the horse.<br /><br />A true crowd pleasure, and every little girls dream (my daughter absolutely LOVES this movie), `Tangled' is a true return to form for Disney; a modern masterpiece of animated proportions.<br /><br />At last, I see the light!<br /><br />:-D</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Vaughn and Wilson Shine"></head><body><p>'Wedding Crashers' stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as a couple of partners in the divorce mediation business.  When the summer rolls around, the two romp through the Washington, D.C. wedding season crashing wedding ceremonies.  They follow a strict set of "full proof" rules in order to impress women that are overwhelmed by the emotions surrounding weddings into engaging in one night stands.<br /><br />Just when it looks like the wedding season has ended, the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury, played by Christopher Walken, is set to be married.  Jeremy, Vaughn's character, impresses another of the Secretaries daughters, but has gotten more than he bargained for.  The wedding day fling quickly turns into an obsession, and Jeremy can't get away.  Meanwhile, John, Wilson's character, has fallen for yet another of the Secretary's daughters.  Problem is, despite hitting it off with her, she has an obnoxious boyfriend.  John can't let it go and finds himself prolonging the wedding day experience in an attempt to impress her.<br /><br />This movie is a lot of fun.  The "Uncorked" edition on the DVD is nice, but having watched the unrated and theatrical versions of the film, I think the theatrical version was just right.  The extra scenes added to the uncorked version weren't necessary and don't add much to the film.  Plus, the "Uncorked" version seems to run a bit long.  Fortunately, both versions are on the DVD.<br /><br />This movie is bested enjoyed if you take it with a grain of salt.  The portrayals of the characters are obvious caricatures of overzealous womanizers, unfaithful politicians, neurtoic and over sexed vixens, and overagressive ivy leaguers.  What makes the theatrical version so much fun is that it offers up outrageous scenes that hit just the right comedic level.<br /><br />I recommend this move to fans of Vaughn (who seems to be in everything these days) and Wilson.  There is a great cameo by a buddy of theirs in the later stages of the film, and those familiar with Wilson's films can probably narrow it down to one or two people.  This is also just a great comedy that should appeal to adults.  Its not recommended for children.<br /><br />Overall rating:  4.25 stars.</p></body></html>

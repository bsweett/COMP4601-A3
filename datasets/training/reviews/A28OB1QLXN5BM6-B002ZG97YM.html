My husband, 13 and 5 year old daughters, and I selected this movie for family movie night a few weeks ago, and we all liked it very much.  HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is a sweet, adorable movie, beautifully rendered, with a kind-hearted messages.<br /><br />DreamWorks really did a nice job with HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON.  In HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, we meet Hiccup, the son of a Viking chief.  Hiccup is, well, different that the other Viking kids; he is skinny, smart, and not particularly interesting in killing things.  Unfortunately, their village is constantly under attack by dragons, and all children must learn to become dragon hunters.  Hiccup does try to kill dragons, but he always fails, often times making things worse for his village.  Finally, through a stroke of pure luck, Hiccup manages to bring down a dreaded Night Fury dragon; but, of course, no one sees it happen.  Not even his father believes his story.  Tenderhearted Hiccup cannot bring himself to kill the dragon, who he names Toothless.  Instead the two bond and form a fast friendship, Hiccup learns how to tame dragons without killing them, and in the end, saves his village and his people from an even worse threat.<br /><br />The plot of HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is story we have all heard before, countless times, but, quite frankly, we didn't care at all.  The animation is gorgeous, the voice actors are quite talented, and the tale is very charmingly told.  My 5 year old loved it (and wants repeated viewings), the 13 year old declared it okay (which at this age is EXTREMELY high praise), and my husband and I enjoyed ourselves.  The messages are clear and kid appropriate:  1. Don't do things just because they've always been done that way.  2.  Think for yourself.  3.  Get to know your enemy.  If you can't remember why you are fighting, it might be time to stop.<br /><br />HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is good family entertainment, perfect for a quiet evening at home.  My kids now want pet dragons.  Hmm...  I wonder if I can fit 2 dragons in the backyard...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Totally Engrossing, Hurt as Alter Ego is Superb"></head><body><p>Apologies to those who track me solely for non-fiction.  I have gotten hooked on "tuning out and winding down" at night with two big bottles of Pelegrino and a "serious" DVD, and Mr. Brooks is such a film.<br /><br />This movie is so good that I had to pause it each time I got up for any reason.  It is absolutely engrossing, and the manner in which they use William Hurt to play the ghostly inner alter ego (fully visible throughout) of a man (Costner) addicted to killing, is world-class.<br /><br />Demi Moore is also superb as a driven cop who just happens to be worth $60 million.  This is easily one of my favorite crime thrillers with psychological nuances.  Very strongly and highly recommended for any thoughtful adult that would like to spend a couple of hours on the wild side.<br /><br />See also:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000050FEN">Seven (New Line Platinum Series)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RGN2JI">Vacancy</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061QJ8A">John Le Carre's A Murder of Quality</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790739739">The Negotiator</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304711883">Ransom</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8DV1W">Firewall (Full Screen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGCR38">Black Book</a></p></body></html>

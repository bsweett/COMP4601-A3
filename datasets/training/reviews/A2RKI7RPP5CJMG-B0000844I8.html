It takes history and science, spins them around in a blender with a cup of fiction, and cranks out a reasonably believable sci-fi classic.  Starring James Spader as a geeky scientist who's really into decoding Egyptian heiroglyphics and a hard-nosed and slightly mentally unstable soldier played by Kurt Russell, "Stargate" gives the viewer a couple of things to ponder.  What if "Ra" wasn't an actual god worshipped by early Egyptians, but an alien looking for a nice group of simpletons to turn into his slaves?  What if those simpletons began to pick up on Ra's deception and run him off, only to have him gather up a few stragglers and start a slave colony on another planet that's linked to Earth via a "Stargate?"<br /><br />All of this sounds a little silly, but deep inside, we all know that there are some reasons to actually entertain the thought that aliens did interact with the ancient Egyptians.  No matter here, it's just used as a backdrop for a wonderful story in which Spader, Russell, and a team of soldiers trek off to the other end of the Stargate in order to see what's there.  When they do get to the other side, they find a colony of people enslaved by Ra.  They're also trying to decipher the gate on their end of the universe in order to get home.  They figure out the entire gate's code almost immediately, except for one symbol, which forces them to interact with the slave colony.  Slowly but surely, they prove to the slaves that Ra can be overthrown and that he isn't an actual god.  Rebellion ensues, and our heroes aid in the battle all the while trying to break the final code.<br /><br />This is a very fun flick to watch.  It mixes just enough parts history, science, and gee-whiz to make for a wonderful tale.  Along with Russell and Spader, it stars French Stewart (Third Rock From The Sun) as one of Russell's troops and Jaye Davidson as Ra.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of fantasy and sci-fi in general.  The Devlin/Emmerich team hit a homerun with this one before stumbling a bit with "Independence Day."  This film is much better and more believable than that flick in my opinion.</p></body></html>

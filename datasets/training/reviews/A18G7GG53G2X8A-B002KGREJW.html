That's a treat from the audience's point of view; no matter how quirky or unconventional the circumstances of the film may be, normal characters have the remarkable ability to connect with viewers. The characters in this film make up the classic dysfunctional family, each member going through their own inner turmoil. They often fight, they regularly swear, and they each have personalities that clash to an incredible degree. How much more real can it get, especially when elements like financial trouble and emotional suffering are thrown into the mix? No one in this film is a rigid caricature, and that made it worthwhile.<br /><br />It's also a very funny film. But I'm using the word "funny" in a very different context, almost (but not quite) with an air of sarcasm. For the most part, it's not funny in a laugh-out-loud kind of way; rather, it's funny in an I-know-exactly-how-that-character-feels kind of way, presenting situations that the audience is able to understand and sympathize with. It was an interesting storytelling method, especially since every main character in this film is forced to partake in something they would rather do without. Olive (Abigail Breslin) is a seven-year-old girl who dreams of someday winning a beauty pageant. To say her family life in New Mexico is chaotic would be an understatement; she shares a home with family members that, at first glance, don't seem compatible in any way.<br /><br />The father, Richard (Greg Kinnear), is a completely misguided motivational speaker-wannabe. The mother, Sheryl (Toni Collette), is a typical caring mom who understands how bad the family's financial situation is. Of course, Richard is certain that his new program--a self-help system that is supposedly completed in just nine steps--will be hailed as the next big thing in striving for excellence. The brother, Dwayne (Paul Dano), is an incredibly unhappy teenager who wants to be in the Air Force and has recently taken a vow of silence (he's also taken to reading the works of Frederick Nitzsche). The uncle, Frank (Steve Carell), has recently attempted suicide due to a failed gay relationship, the loss of his job, and the loss of a prestigious teaching award. Finally, there's the grandfather (Alan Arkin), a cantankerous old man who seems to have many regrets in life, most of which involve not having lived fast or died young. For these reasons, he's now snorts heroine on a regular basis.<br /><br />Apparently, Olive had competed in an Albuquerque child beauty pageant and came in second. But some weeks later, Cheryl's sister calls and tells the family the good news: the first place winner of that contest has been disqualified ("Something to do with diet pills!"). By default, Olive is now eligible to compete in the national Little Miss Sunshine pageant. As you can probably imagine, this sends Olive into a whirlwind of excitement. But because Cheryl's sister is unable to take Olive, this sends the rest of the family into a whirlwind of doubt, uncertainty, and panic. The pageant is being held in Redondo Beach, California; not only can they not afford to fly there, Richard is also trying to contact marketing exec Stan Grossman (Bryan Cranston) in the hopes of turning the nine-step program into a sellable product. What's worse is that Frank can't be left alone for fear of another suicide attempt. The only viable solution is for the entire family to drive to California.<br /><br />Thus begins the family's journey across the Southwestern United States, one that will test them in almost every conceivable way. One of the biggest obstacles is their Volkswagen bus; the clutch is completely shot, and since they don't have the time or the money to repair it, they have to physically push the car until it reaches third gear (they also can't rely on the brakes). But more compelling are the emotional obstacles each character will have to clear in their own way. The scenes in the van were probably the most significant in terms of allowing the characters to face their problems. Bickering ensues almost immediately, especially between Grandpa, Richard, and Frank. But it's Richard's dialogue that is the most priceless: he just can't get out of his you-should-only-be-a-winner mode, constantly spewing his self-help banter about how methods like sarcasm and quitting are only used by losers. In fact, he thinks they represent one of the lowest of the nine steps. The only kinds of people who do deserve respect are those who actually have goals and are trying to follow them through.<br /><br />He praises Olive for this mindset; she wants to be involved in a beauty pageant, and because of consistent practicing and the firm belief that she can win, he's willing to support her. Of course, this makes Olive very concerned. From her point of view, her father hates losers, and if she doesn't win, she fears he'll stop loving her. Ready to reassure her is her grandfather; as crotchety as he is, he's also a caring individual, standing by his granddaughter's side no matter what (there's also a very touching scene in the van when he praises Richard for going after what he believed in). He even goes as far as to teach her some moves (none of which we actually see until the end of the movie; boy, is the audience in for a surprise).<br /><br />But this kind of character complexity isn't limited to just the grandfather; at one point or another, all the family members display different personality traits, ones that make them impossible to label. Again, I go back to the realism of the story: no one in this film is a flat, undeveloped stereotype, just as no one is completely good or bad. They're just ordinary, everyday, flawed people, and they do everything they can to get Olive to California in time. One gets the sense that no matter how much this family goes through, no matter how many arguments they have, they'll always be together, for better or worse. That's the kind of family we'd all like to have, especially when everyone can learn something valuable.<br /><br />By the time they reach California, they've gone through enough to last them a lifetime, from emotional breakdowns to malfunctioning van equipment to an escapade with a dead body (whose dead body I dare not say). And yet they're ready to let Olive do what she's always dreamed of doing. This is despite the fact that the world of children's beauty pageants hits them like a ton of bricks. Backstage, we see just how far these little girls go to look beautiful: they don hairpieces and false teeth; they're airbrushed with makeup and sunless tanners; they're dressed in sparkly, provocative dresses. When the contestants are on stage, Olive is the only one that actually looks like a real child (which basically means that she's not beauty pageant material).<br /><br />The final scenes of "Little Miss Sunshine" are almost too perfect for words. I won't describe them for want of you going out there and seeing this movie for yourself. I will say that it all comes together in a way that's beautiful, funny, and touching all at the same time. How appropriate for a film about the trials and tribulations of family life. There's quite a bit one can learn from a movie like this, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to experience it. One thing I learned was that this was more than story about a beauty pageant. It's actually much simpler than that; it's a story about life and discovering who you are in this world (and I don't mean that in a hokey way). What a perfect message; there aren't enough of them in movies these days.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Chicks Kick Butt"></head><body><p>I have been a big fan of Milla Jovovich from her [...]kicking days in The Fifth Element so I was looking forward to seeing this flick where she plays the lead, Violet, in a futuristic world where no viruses exist except one.<br /><br />The last surviving virus was human made and causes an early death within twelve years. It also causes an abnormal canine tooth growth causing the virus to be called the vampire virus. It's very contagious and puts the rest of the human population on high alert and forced segregation. Violet is part of an underground team that is fighting back.<br /><br />The movie opens with her on her current mission. Breaking into the dictator's (played by the always exceptionally evil Nick Chinlund) fortress to steal a package. The package contains a child with an antigen and everyone wants to kill him except Violet. With 36 hours left to live she makes it her mission to protect the child.<br /><br />The action scenes are a work of art to witness but more time should have been spent on the storyline development. Cameron Bright (Birth) who plays the cloned boy was really underused and probably too talented for such a minor role. If you want to see a chick kick lots of male [...] to pieces then this is your movie.</p></body></html>

This is a somber, dark film about a 1950's suburban couple, April and Frank Wheeler (Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio), who are ill at ease and dissatisfied with their so-called perfect life.  Frank hates the job he commutes to five days a week.  April finds her days long and empty.  Both feel life is passing them by too quickly and long for something more.<br /> They decide relocating to Paris is just the thing to energize them both.  April will get a high-paying job as a government agency secretary while Frank takes time to think about what he'd like to do.  Their savings will see them through several months.  Initially elated by their decision to uproot themselves and their two children to start a new life overseas, they meet with circumstances that create serious obstacles.<br /> The Wheelers are unhappy not so much with each other but with the feeling that their suburban life has not been the satisfying goal they expected it to be.  Winslet and Di Caprio have a number of heavy-duty verbal fights that ring true, thanks to Sam Mendes' on-the-money direction.  April is a woman trapped in a life of her own making -- a life that has let her down.  It's not as easy as chalking it up to a marriage gone sour.  She still loves Frank, and that is part of her tragedy.  She wants more for both of them, and is desperate for a way out.<br /> Michael Shannon co-stars as the son of a real estate agent (Kathy Bates) who has recently been released from a mental institution.  His character is the one person who sees things more "normal" people -- even the Wheelers -- are blind to.  Mr. Shannon was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role.<br /> Bonus extras include commentary by director Sam Mendes, a making-of featurette, and deleted scenes.  The Blu-ray edition contains the biographical profile, "Richard Yates: The Wages of Truth."</p></body></html>

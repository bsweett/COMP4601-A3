Honestly, I'll go see an action-adventure or science fiction fantasy film on the big screen over any other genre. And the Marvel classics translate very well to film, particularly if you have a writer like Peter David doing the novelization.<br /><br />The story in brief:  when Star Industries CEO and wunderkind engineer Tony Stark (Downey, Jr) is kidnapped by terrorists, he builds an Iron Man suit to escape rather than creating the missile they demanded.<br /><br />Back at home, he decides to convert Stark into a more politically correct company and 'make peace instead of war.'  He hadn't reckoned with the terrorists re-arming and deceit from his own camp.<br /><br />The acting's great. I think Terrence Howard (Colonel Rhodes) is going to be the next Denzel Washington.  He's a good actor and easy on the eyes. Jeff Bridges broke out of type and served as a pretty amazing Obadiah Stane.<br /><br />The imagery is fabulous. Scenes from Stark's capture were gripping.  His fellow captive, Yinsen (played by Shaun Toub) was an interesting and sad character, such a waste of a brilliant man.<br /><br />The soundtrack is particularly good with strong, evocative musical images. Okay, I wish they'd used Black Sabbath's version of "Iron Man" for the soundtrack, but that's already been used by both "Detroit Rock City" and "Lords of Dogtown."<br /><br />Best of all, for a vertigo sufferer like me, there was minimal monkey cam.  I could follow almost all the action without a problem.  Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed "Iron Man" and may well see the film again before it leaves the big screen.</p></body></html>

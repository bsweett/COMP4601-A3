If it failed at the box office she could be faced with the prospect of more Scooby Doo sequels while its success could lead to bigger and better things. After all, it was her first serious film role after six years on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and proof that she could carry a movie on her name alone. Gellar is smart. She doesn't stray from the genre that made her a star. The financial success of The Grudge surpassed expectations that the studio had for it and a sequel is already in the works.<br /><br />There is a spirited audio commentary by Sam and Ted Raimi, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rob Tapert, Clea DuVall, Stephen Susco, Jason Behr and KaDee Strickland. Tapert MCs the proceedings, often prompting the participants with questions. Everybody recounts production anecdotes, including working in Japan, getting used to their customs and working with Shimizu.<br /><br />"A Powerful Rage: Behind The Grudge" examines several aspects of the movie and can be viewed in five separate featurettes or altogether. Unlike the original, which used actual locations, the house in this new version existed entirely on a set. The cast also talk about Shimizu's distinctive vision and his working methods.<br /><br />Finally, "Under the Skin" features Dr. Joseph LeDoux, a professor of neural science and psychology. He talks about how fear in horror films work on its audience.</p></body></html>

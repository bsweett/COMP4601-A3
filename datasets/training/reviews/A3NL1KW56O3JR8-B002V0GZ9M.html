<meta name="summary" content="They blew it with the ending"></head><body><p>This had the potential to be a very good movie.  Both Bullock and Reeves do a good job.  If you can suspend disbelief enough to accept the whole communication between time thing, then the plot is interesting (although a touch slow in development).  The problem is: they completely bombed on the ending.  I can't say too much because people will whine that I'm a spoiler but . . .  The movie had set up a great (but tragic) ending but, instead, they opted for the contrived happy-ever-after ending.  In one moment it went from a compelling story to sentimentalist fluff.  They did such a good job building up the conflict and they resolve it like this?  How disappointing.<br /><br />I would have given this 4 stars but for the ending.</p></body></html>

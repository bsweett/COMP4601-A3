Kevin Costner is just as impressive as well, as Denny Davies. The supporting cast, led by Mike Binder (who also wrote and directed the movie), is excellent. Binder's directing and screenplay are brilliant and well worth an Oscar nomination for next year. The music by Alexandre Desplat is excellent. The cinematography by Richard Greatrex is excellent. The film editing by Steve Edwards and Robin Sales is excellent. The casting by Danielle Roffe is excellent. The production design by Chris Roope is excellent. The art direction by Tim Stevenson is excellent. The set decoration by Neesh Ruben is excellent. The costume design by Deborah is excellent. This is an brilliantly executed film and it is also one of the year's best!</p></body></html>

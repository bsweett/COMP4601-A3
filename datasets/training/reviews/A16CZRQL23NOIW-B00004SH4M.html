<meta name="summary" content="The great James in his best"></head><body><p>In the the third film  of this Bond series this may well be his favorite : (for me it's the best) there are enough reasons to hold this statement.<br />Harold Sakata is the most hated villain in any Bond picture, the maquiavelian mind and overwhelming presence of Auric Goldfinger , the unforgettable swiss landscapes , the girls Honor Blackman who is two steps behind of Daniela Bianchi (From Russia with love) and Claudine Auger (Thunderball) in what beauty concerns , the laser sequence , the poker game , the fine and suggestive dialogues , the ambush in the hall , the battle in Fort Knox and that hair raising final combat in the airplane, the dazzling direction of Guy Hamilton and the spectacular Aston Martin.<br />What else do you need for watching by the first time this one or remind it in case you saw before as a timeless cult movie ?<br />And please beware of any other hat in the head of someone like Odd Job.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Aeon Flux: super assasin with no history."></head><body><p>Let me first say that I loved the Aeon Flux series on Mtv. It positively blew my mind. I use to watch this animated cartoon along with the greats. First came THE Maxx, then The State, Then Aeon. But, now that she's been poured into cinematic form, it seems that all the fan-nostalgia has been washed right out of me.<br /><br />Charlize theron, a brillant actress, Chameleon actress, did well in portraying Aeon as a kick-butt assasin who takes her work very seriously. I wouldn't have wanted anyone else to play Aeon but her, to be honest.<br /><br />But, alas, looking like a character doesn't necessarily mean that you will embody that character.<br /><br />The story takes place in the very far future as the last remaining humans build a city to house the last survivors of the population. Aeon, mingled in with the society, visits her sister often and has the feeling that the regime has been hiding something. Especially since people are dissapearing with no explanation for it.<br /><br />Now, as I was watching this movie, I couldn't help but notice that it had a similar outline to that of V FOR VENDETTA. But, sadly, this is no V FOR VENDETTA.<br /><br />The action was good and well cherographed, I admit.<br /><br />The costumes and plot were also very well done.<br /><br />If anything, I like the premise and story of this timeless character and movie.<br /><br />But, with this movie, I think they thrusted the audience too fast into the movie without really spending the time or effort in re-telling the backstory of Aeon and the Regime. Some parts I got confused as to whether everything was comprehendible or if it was just me. STAR WARS had a similar approach, introducing gadgets that need no explaination, but Aeon somehow falls flat in this department. It's not that the gagdets aren't well explained, it's just that they seem to almost pop out of nowhere or need MORE explaining.<br /><br />I'm Not saying that I hate the movie. I think that they did a spectacular job . . . but they could've done better. They could've spent more time with the backstory, becuase, in essence, that's what keeps us all interested in the characters. And I think that they could've at least spent more time on how the story would unfold. Each frame was not like a painting like it was in V FOR VENDETTA.<br /><br />It almost seems, when watching this movie, that they left something out or something was missing for the grand masterpiece. Thankfully, this doesn't hurt Charlize's career in any way but the film needs a lot of work still.<br /><br />I say, that if you are a hardcore Aeon Flux fan, that these things won't matter much. But, if you are a person who has never really been into the series, it may take you a long while to warm up to these characters. You may have to watch the original series and then come back to this movie in order to fully appreciate it more.<br /><br />I'd say that 40% of the movie was hype.<br /><br />Final verdict: Needs more history. Still good though.</p></body></html>

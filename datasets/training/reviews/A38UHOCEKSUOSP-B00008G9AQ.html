<meta name="summary" content="[4.5] Huge improvement over the first Harry Potter film"></head><body><p>It is year two at Hogwarts, and there are already big changes at work since the first film.  The three main characters - Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are quickly beginning to grow up.  Their actor counterparts will be the biggest surprise, with the boys already sporting much lower voices and taller heights.  Most of the same characters return from the first film, along with some newcomers such as the villainous Lucius Malfoy - deliciously played by Jason Isaacs (you may remember him as Mel Gibson's opponent in The Patriot).  His son, Draco, returns as well, up to his usual no good ways of insulting Harry and his friends.<br /><br />The story behind "you know who" continues in this film.  The Chamber of Secrets is the newest mystery at Hogwarts, and the biggest threat at present.  Harry must follow lots of clues to solve the puzzle, which is fun in the sense of watching a good mystery.  Aside from the chamber plot, there is a lot of fun in this film, including a lot of action and a lot of humor - a huge improvement over the first film.  Even the special effects have easily tripled in effectiveness, especially an intense scene of Quidditch and the very scary and amazing climactic showdown of the film - easily better than the climax of the prior movie as well.<br /><br />Overall, Chamber is much edgier, darker, scarier, and intriguing than the first Potter film.  This is easily one of my favorite films of the series to date, mostly because it has come so far as a sequal.  Though the films are meant to follow the novels of Rowling, the creators of this film have definetly put more into the second Potter film than one might expect.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hiccup & Toothless: Enjoyable Ride from the Directors of "Lilo & Stitch""></head><body><p>"How to Train Your Dragon" is a fantasy adventure film from DreamWorks Animation. Unlike hilarious "Shrek" (I'm talking about the first one), the company's new computer animated film does not rearrange or subvert the genre's conventions much. Instead, with the straightforward narrative suitable for the material, "How to Train Your Dragon" tells a good story in a compelling way; in short, thrilling actions, likable characters and great animation.<br /><br />Set in the Viking village of Berk, the story begins with a young boy Hiccup (voice by Jay Baruchel, "The Sorcerer's Apprentice"), who wants to be a real warrior, despite his obvious lack of skills, if not courage. One night, during the dragons' attacks on his village, Hiccup sets out to fight on his own with a weapon of his own making though his father and village leader Stoick (Gerard Butler) orders him to stay inside. Hiccup's reckless action results in the friendship between him and a wounded dragon the Night Fury or "Toothless."<br /><br />The story takes an unexpected turn when Hiccup realizes that dragons "have to" raid the village. The film is orthodox in its storytelling - a son who wants to impress his father, a feisty girl who wants to prove herself, rivalry and romance between them, etc. - but with the well-drawn characters you relate to, the film is never boring. Also, the film's exciting aerial sequences should not be missed.<br /><br />"How to Train Your Dragon" is directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, a team known for their joyful Disney animation film "Lilo & Stitch." The film adaptation of "How to Train Your Dragon" is exactly what you expect from the creators of those two lovable characters. Enjoy the ride.</p></body></html>

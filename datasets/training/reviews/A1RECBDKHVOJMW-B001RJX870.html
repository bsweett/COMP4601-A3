<meta name="summary" content="A Brilliant Chronicle Of Hitler's Last Gasp!"></head><body><p>It is April 20, 1945, and Adolf Hitler celebrates his bizarre last birthday in the F&uuml;hrerbunker, the underground fortress far beneath Berlin's Wilhelm Strasse, where the architects of the Third Reich are about to meet their end. The Chancellery is in ruins, as is the rest of the Reich. Six years of war and bombing have laid waste all Europe. The Soviet Red Army is pounding at the city gates, having finally overpowered the German military machine - a vivid reminder that there is little cause for the F&uuml;hrer to celebrate this day with cake and ice cream. Traudl Junge, (played by Alexandra Maria Lara), is at Hitler's side in the bunker, as she has been since 1942 - at the Berghof, in Berchtesgaden, in Ostpreissen, and in glittering pre- Gotterdammerung Berlin. Hitler, himself, hired her to be his personal secretary, and she remained in her position until the end. Frau Junge was nearby when Adolf Hitler committed suicide in 1945, not long after his birthday. This is the hour of Hitler's final downfall.<br /><br />"Downfall," (Der Untergang), a two and a half hour film, chronicles the twelve day period from April 20 until May 2, 1945. This is an absolutely riveting, historically accurate and detailed account of the end of Adolf Hitler and his infamous Third Reich - which did not last the 1000 years envisioned by the Nazis, but did manage to reap havoc, destruction, despair and cause the deaths of millions and million of human beings. (Almost sixty million people perished worldwide as a result of WWII). Producer/screenwriter Bernd Eichinger, along with Director Oliver Hirschbiegel drew on a best-selling Hitler biography, "Inside Hitler's Bunker," by award-winning historian Joachim Fest, and the memoirs of the late Traudl Junge, the F&uuml;hrer's last personal secretary, to make this outstanding film. Apparently, "Downfall" is the first internationally released German production to feature Hitler as a central figure. Swiss actor Bruno Ganz performs brilliantly as the leader of the Third Reich.<br /><br />Hirschbiegel paints a hellish picture of the mad, surrealistic bunker world, where fun-loving Eva Braun, (Juliane K&ouml;hler), throws parties while bombs are falling just overhead, and meals are served on fine china while starving Germans try to survive the Russian shelling. Grandiose war plans are still being made. Entertainment is provided, strict protocol is observed. Meanwhile, Hitler lies on the sofa in his leisure moments, eating cake, (talk about Marie Antoinette!), and chatting about his dogs. His generals discuss the best methods to commit suicide. Dozens of corpses swing from city trees and lampposts - fresh bodies, (examples to all of what happens to bad citizens), and those left over from the wave of executions in March. Fear, hopelessness and despair cause thousands of Berliners to kill themselves each month. In one scene, Eva offers Albert Speer, the minister of armaments and munitions, (Heino Ferch), cookies and champagne because he has been unable to eat all day.<br /><br />Although Ganz does not physically resemble Adolf Hitler, even with make-up, in an extraordinarily accomplished performance he takes on his character's persona emotionally, using the same facial expressions, body language and gestures to such a degree that he actually becomes Hitler on the big screen. At times, I totally forgot about physical differences. Palsied, stoop-shouldered, Ganz walks with Hitler's particular lurching gait, pacing the narrow, claustrophobic bunker corridors. Usually a meticulous man, his clothes are now food stained and his sight is so bad he can scarcely read. The Fuhrer had been unwell for some time, and it is clear that now, at the end of his life, he is totally out of control. He experiences violent mood swings. On occasion, he predicts victory and gives orders to move nonexistent troops to defend Berlin. He graciously bestows meaningless positions and appointments on some, and orders the arrests and executions of others. Not long after these manically optimistic episodes, he throws tantrums and rants, in momentary surges of psychotic fury. He rails against his formerly close cohorts - Himmler, (Ulrich Noethen), is suing for a separate peace with the Allies, while Goering, from his Bavarian retreat, is trying to usurp Hitler's leadership. As his personality continues to disintegrate, paranoia takes over and he rages and condemns the actions of the treasonous officers who "sabotaged" his grand plans. With the Allies crossing the Rhine River and the Russians closing in, he finally acknowledges defeat and decides to commit suicide - but he wants Germany to follow suit. Deutschland, he argues, had proved itself unworthy of his genius and had failed to prevail in the struggle for life. Then, thoughtfully, in all seriousness, he expounds upon his planned scorched-earth sacrifice of Germany, which Albert Speer refuses to carry out. By the end of his life, it's clear that Hitler is neither in command of the country he raised to glory then smashed to smithereens, nor of his own sanity.<br /><br />Ulrich Matthes as loyal propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, and Corinna Harfouch as his wife Magda also deliver superb performances. The film's most chilling, horrifying scene is Magda's final one with her children.<br /><br />The movie begins and ends with interview footage of the aged Traudl Junge, from the documentary "Blind Spot" in which she notes how naive she was. She maintained, until the end of her life in 2002, how unaware she was of the horrors perpetrated at Hitler's behest. She recognized, however, that she had no right to be so uninformed, so ignorant - that there was no excuse.  She acknowledges her passive complicity and personal responsibility as a German.<br /><br />Subplots are played out on the streets of Berlin - a boy, (Donevan Gunia), defies his father to defend the city, and a military doctor, (Christian Berkel), stays behind to help the wounded. The contrasts between the world above with the one belowground is very effective in demonstrating how isolated Hitler and his small cadre of followers have become. Politicians use the term, "the bunker mentality," to describe this out-of-touch mind-set.<br /><br />"Downfall" is cinema at its best. It is also a terrible, but necessary lesson in history - one that those who govern should learn well in order to prevent this evil from being repeated. Adolf Hitler has been dead for over 60 years now, as are many of those who were his cronies and minions, yet the study of this man, who I believe personifies evil, never fails to fascinate. I highly recommend viewing this exceptional movie.<br /><br />DVD special features include a feature on the making of the film, interviews with the cast and crew, and a commentary by the director.<br /><br />JANA</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="colossal disappointment of a DVD"></head><body><p>This review is about the discs themselves and not the movie. So what exactly are on these 2 DVDs? The answer: not a whole lot. In fact, this edition is shockingly devoid of content.. a real disappointment considering how great some other 2-disc sets are.<br /><br />The first disc is only the movie. No audio commentary, nothing, so why even put a "Special Features" item on the menu screen? Selecting it tells you to see Disc 2. I realize this is a long movie (over 2 hours), so space was an issue here, but the studio could've squeezed in an audio commentary track. It doesn't take that much space. Director/actor commentaries are par for the course these days and a lot of people enjoy listening to them and consider them essential to a DVD purchase. Instead, we have a French dubbed track.. and we all know how people love dubs, and French, no less.<br /><br />The second disc is appallingly miserly in content: three 10-15 minute production featurettes, a 3-D gallery of the gods (who cares about bad 3D?) which are about 5 minutes each god, and subtitles. That's it! End of story. All in all, that's less than 1 hour of content. The featurettes are mildly interesting, but are too short and left me wanting more. That's the reason I and a whole lot of people buy these DVD 2 disc sets: to see the behind the scenes stuff and details about the film making process.<br /><br />Other historically based movie DVD's like Kingdom of Heaven and Last Samurai pack a lot of content in and you get a lot for your money. Not here. The second disc is virtually useless. Yet another lazy DVD put out by a studio seeking to cut corners. Don't reward lazy studios. Heaven is a much better movie and has a lot of overlap with this one (some of the same actors: Bloom, Gleeson), huge epic battle scenes.. plus it's a Ridley Scott film, and the DVD is packed with features.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A beautiful story that continues to evolve and grow."></head><body><p>Jason Voorhees has become the most beloved of Hollywood's strong, silent type. Part 3 is a step above Parts 1 &amp; 2. Although the first two films definately had their moments, Part 3 is where the famous 'Jasonesque' takes root and conquers America. Not only is Jason finally the way we want him to be, Part 3 also included a complex script with side stories and deeper character development. If you really analyze this film, you will see that not only does it have all the makings of an Acadamy Award, it is a brilliant tribute to directing. Let me explain.......<p>This film is most infamous because Jason finally gets his hockey mask. He takes it off his victim (he also takes the speargun). The victim in question is a fat, pathetic white kid with a big afro. He is always pulling practical jokes, not to scare or hurt, but for attention. His friend asks him why he continues with his hijinks. Poeticly, he answers &quot;I'd rather be a loser than nothing at all'. How many here reading this right now have not told themselves the same thing? Everyone, all together, group hug.<p>Even though this movie is early 80's it is far ahead of its time in social views. For the first time in a movie, a Latino / Hispanic American is represented in the form of a teenage girl. The story gives subtle yet obvious clues into her life. She has an argument with her 'mama' before heading out to the farm. Her mother doesn't want her hanging around her 'white hoodlum devil' friends. &quot;We don't take food stamps here!&quot; is a phrase I'm sure she's heard many times, but our fat loser saves the day with cash, but the wallet causes a whole other problem......<p>The beautiful thing about this movie is that it breaks the social and racial barriers. A biker gang (consisting of course of three people) is post-racial. We have a white guy, a black guy, and a Spanish woman. See how the three of them get along as equals. Harmony for all, that is the real message of Friday the 13th Part 3.<p>And lastly we have a tribute to our noble past, the 1960's. Two middle aged burnouts who have nothing to do with the story and who have nothing to contribute to the plot, simply become fodder for the machette. This is the director telling us that the glory days of drug abuse is over. Clean bodies and minds will lead us through the 80's, 90's and into the millenium. Drug users have no place in society's future and thank God it worked out that way.<p>With plenty of action (tubby running over motorcycles with a VW Beetle to defend the honor of his hot tamale love interest) and suspense (will Jason survive a hanging and axe to the head?) to drama (who could have guessed the biker was alive in the barn the whole time? Swing that chain!) and finally the conclusion of this exciting and marvellous film. Part 4 only continued in the fine tradition of high quality film making.</p></body></html>

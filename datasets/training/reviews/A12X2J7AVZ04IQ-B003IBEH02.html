<meta name="summary" content="Intense, Unsettling Peter Jackson opus..."></head><body><p>I chose not to read other Amazon reviews because I wanted my opinions to be original, without prejudice. I never read the book. I am, however, familiar with the work of Peter Jackson, and his amazing ability to create a different world, from that which we think we know. "The Lovely Bones" is worthy of consideration, from a film perspective. Jackson's apex was the LOTR trilogy, brilliant by any standards. There's a definite look to a Jackson film, mostly the ethereal colors and cinematography, and always a fine script. "Heavenly Creatures" brought Jackson to the attention of the American public, followed by the unbelievable "The Frighteners", with Michael J Fox, one of the most enjoyable fantasy/adventures  I've ever seen. Other-worldly things seem to project Mr Jackson to greatness, and "The Lovely Bones" is no exception. Saoirse Ronan, after an auspicious debut in "Atonement" (Oscar nominated) seems a seasoned pro in the central character, complex in her confusion, dissappointment and tremendous love and compassion. I never doubted for a minute that she was talking to me with utmost sincerity. Darlings of the Oscar: Susan Sarandon, Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz are all terrific...add to that newly nominated Stanley Tucci (long overdue) for his oily, snakey and thoroughly fleshed-out performance as the creepy catalyst. Rose McIver is excellent as the younger sister. Whether or not you're comparing the film to the book, this definitely stands on its own as a fine achievement in film-making. Peter Jackson's ability to project the viewer to another place is exceptional. The book may not have been filmed without the vision, sensitivity and grace of a visionary like Mr. Jackson. I enjoyed the film very much.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Great Sequel!""></head><body><p>Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis star in this 1981 horror sequel.<br />A doctor continues to hunt an escaped killer targeting a girl at a<br />hospital. This is a great sequel and should've been the last. This<br />dvd has good picture and sound, but only a trailer. I recommend<br />this for your horror collection.</p></body></html>

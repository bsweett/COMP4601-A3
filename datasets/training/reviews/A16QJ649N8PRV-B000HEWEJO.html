I did not know what I had been missing.<br /><br />Featuring Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, this is a classic in every sense of the term.  Bailey is a regular guy living in an average town.  He has a brother who becomes a big war hero and a good friend who becomes very wealthy.  Not George.  He just keeps plugging away at his life.<br /><br />A series of events hits him that leaves him very discouraged.  He is contemplating suicide and speculating that it would have been better had he never been born.  An angel is sent to help him.<br /><br />During the course of the movie, the angel reveals to George many things and people that would have been worse off if not for his presence.  It is not only a great story, but it will also prompt viewers to consider that even seemingly small things that they do may have a big impact on others.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for viewers of all ages and interests.</p></body></html>

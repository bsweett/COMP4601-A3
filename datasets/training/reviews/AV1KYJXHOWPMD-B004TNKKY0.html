<meta name="summary" content="GOOD COLLECTION!"></head><body><p>Back to the futere collection is a very good set. Allt the disks have what a good box set should have: animorphic widescreen, 5.1 surround sound, digital mastering, extras, comentary, and a good movie. The original back to the future is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The two sequels are just fine, but I think that the franchise should have ended with the first. I give the first film five stars and the two sequels about three stars. Very recomended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="wonderful from start and finish...one of 2003's best"></head><body><p>with its beginning that pulled me in and then the end where it all blasted out. good battle sequences and great acting especially by Russell Crowe, hes a dynamite actor, an actor ahead of his game id say. beautiful and dizzingy camera shots and directed with ease by Peter Weir(Witness, The Truman Show). though there are some predictable parts like when Paul Bettany(the doctor) trys to find his bird and I knew the french ship was gonna be there. other parts like when the doctor got shot was a surprise. and what the heck is this I read about this is a sequel to Pirates Of The Carribean..its not people and its not a ripoff either. Pirates of The Carribean is a ride at Disneyworld and dont get me wrong its a frickin great movie but Master and Commander is like book 1 of the other 20 books in the series and the book is like the movie.</p></body></html>

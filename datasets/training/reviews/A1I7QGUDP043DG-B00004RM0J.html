Though more entertaining when I was younger, I view it as a great trip down memory lane. A humorous story of kids and teens trying to save their beloved 'Goondocks' from rich developers. When they bump into some hilarious, misfit outlaws, they accidentally find themselves in a tunnel that leads to a treasure listed on an old map.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

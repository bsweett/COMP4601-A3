But it's Tarrantino, so it's to be expected.  The direction on this is fabulous, the acting, the story, the pacing, the cinematic appeal...  It's really an interesting perspective, retelling a Nazi-era drama, though as one should expect, the underlying details are gritty, ugly, and sometimes gross.  The convergence of subplots into the primary story is well done and exciting.  If you're OK with Tarrantino's needful spin of fetish-cum-violence, this film will not disappoint, and may leave you thinking about how war criminals are really treated in our culture.</p></body></html>

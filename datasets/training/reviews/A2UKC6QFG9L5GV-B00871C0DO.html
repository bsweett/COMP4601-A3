<meta name="summary" content="BEST WEREWOLF MOVIE EVER"></head><body><p>"An American Werewolf in London" was the first horror movie I saw in my life. I guess it was in the end of 80s and I was thrilled then. As was I about ten years later when it unexpectedly came in my hands. Immediately I decided I had to possess this flick because I thought it's a movie for ages. And till now I haven't changed my mind. "American Werewolf" is a real horror film in all the meaning of this word and it has the right amount of humor ("Mom, a naked american stole my balloons"). There are some sequences which I consider classic - this is what a true horror movie should be like (I'm talking about the sequence with a werewolf attack at moors in the beginning or about the subway scene or ingenious episode where the main character is chasing a deer in the forest). "American Werewolf" looks rather frightful although sometimes it seems John Landis didn't have such an intention. It seems the movie was supposed to be "horror" only in quotes and indeed to be fun. But the creators achieved more than they expected - one of the best contemporary (well, I guess we still may call it contemporary) horror films was born.<br /><br />The make up is a whole different story. If someone tells you he saw a better man-werewolf transformation scene than in "American Werewolf", don't believe this person, he's lying. I have never seen better and I have seen a lot. It's amazing how nowdays they try to make everything with computer graphics and fail because we can always tell the difference between a living person and a computer one. Why don't they just return to good old make up? What Rick Baker (who got an Academy Award for this film) did is absolutely astonishing. Now, 25 years later the transformation scene still looks awesome, I can't figure a single detail which seems out of place. I repeat: there's no werewolf movie which can top this one as far as make up is concerned. Just "Howling" (which by the way was shot also about 25 years ago) was very close but still...<br /><br />"An American Werewolf" to my opinion is the best werewolf movie ever and one of the most notable horror films in general. So I guess it's a must for every cinema fan. Besides this edition has a very interesting "making of" featurette.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A story about magic tricks that unfolds as if it were one itself"></head><body><p>At the beginning of the movie we learn that magicians view their tricks as three act plays, The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige.  This movie is also presented in this way.  We learn about two young apprentice magicians who are friends.  Both live in poor circumstances, but they have very different characters.  Christian Bale plays Alfred Bordon, who is the more talented of the two, but is hurt as a magician because of his misanthropic personality.  He is less charismatic and less able to connect with the audience than the more flamboyant Robert Angier played by Hugh Jackman.<br /><br />The story is not told lienearly and doesn't explain much about when we are jumping forward and backwards.  It more or less unfolds in its own way and you pick up bits and pieces and try to add them to what you have been told.  The point being is that you are never sure if you have stuck this new bit of info in the right place or are even seeing it the right way.<br /><br />Something goes horribly wrong during one dangerous trick and this sets off a more than bitter rivalry between the two men.  Of course, as things escalate between the two there are bystanders taken into the vortex of their attempts at mutual professional (and physical) destruction.<br /><br />David Bowie does a very interesting turn as Nikola Tesla, who really did live in Colorado Springs at the time the movie is set, and did have a huge magnifying transmitter in his laboratory that is also shown in the movie.  A powerful visual image.  How he becomes involved in the lives of the protagonists, I will leave to the movie to explain to you.<br /><br />Even if you think you have figured out the main punch line of the movie, the actual Prestige of the final act is not likely be what you think it is.  In fact, it has multiple layers.<br /><br />Enjoy it.  Fine performances are given throughout, especially by the women drawn into their lives to their eventual sorrow.  They are Piper Perabo, Rebecca Hall, and Scarlett Johansson.  And of course, Michael Caine is the anchor of the whole thing and plays his role with perfection.<br /><br />I recommend it very much.</p></body></html>

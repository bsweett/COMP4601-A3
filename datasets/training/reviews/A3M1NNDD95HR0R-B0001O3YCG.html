Vin Diesel was born for this role.  He plays a convict that is supposed to be transported, but he ends up getting out and helping the characters survive the alien onslaught.  Riddick does a wicked good job making you believe he is hardcore and you shouldn't mess with him.  He is also the savior of the movie.  All in all, Sci-Fi fans everywhere should see this movie.  I liked it better than Chronicles of Riddick (Pitch Black 2).</p></body></html>

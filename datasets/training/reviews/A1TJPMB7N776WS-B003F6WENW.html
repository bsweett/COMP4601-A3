The following subjects are commented upon by the various movie characters in as negative a way as is possible: Marriage, FDR, Eleanor Roosevelt, Catholicism, Women, Men, Gays, Macho Men, Girly-Men, The US Senate, Infidelity, Bagging Chicks, Virginity, Older Men/Younger Women Relationships, Older Women/Younger Men Relationships, Sybil...<br />2. A Family Dinner that is right up there with Woody Allen's Family Dinner scene in "Annie Hall" to the point that both movies share an actor: Christopher Walken...here playing the relatively sane, US Finance Secretary Cleary. Cleary's Mother (Isla Fisher) spouts off about FDR, calls Eleanor Roosevelt a raging woman lover, condemns her own grandson as a homosexual...and on and on.... hilarious.<br />3. Rachel McAdams as Claire Cleary: adorable, funny...she lights up the screen.<br />4. Vince Vaughn as Jeremy Grey: this guy just keeps getting funnier and funnier. If you thought he was "out there" in "Be Cool" you haven't seen anything yet.<br />With all that said the movie has a heart of Gold. David Dobkin has kept a tight rein on all of this silliness so that none of it goes out of control. I was surprised at how much I like this film. Go...check it out.</p></body></html>

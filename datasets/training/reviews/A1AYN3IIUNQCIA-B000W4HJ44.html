<meta name="summary" content="One of the best summer surprises"></head><body><p>Hairspray was one of the few movies in the summer of 2007 that really just took me by surprise. I walked in expecting just another musical and came out feeling on top of the world. Now i will say, i have never seen the 1988 original or the broadway musical, so while i can't say this is the best adaptation of Hairspray, i say it comes pretty darn close.<br /><br />The premise of the story is relativly simple. A plus-sized girl named Tracey Turnblad (the delightfull Nikky Blonksi) dreams of dancing on the huge TV hit the Corney Collins show but naturally, she faces challenges from the vindictive show producer (Pfeiffer vamping it up) and falling in love with the most talented dancer on the show.<br /><br />The muscial numbers were great, both campy, full of energy and inspiring, particularily the final number "You Can't Stop The Beat", which had me tapping my feet and my heart soar. Not only that but the movie was hilarious! I found my self laughing so hard at certain points and it has been awhile since a movie has made me laugh so hard. All the actors are great, some impressing me more then others. First off, who can honestly say that they knew Amanda Bynes could sing? And as for Travolta as the mom? A piece of casting genius. This is probally his best role since Pulp Fiction (and no, i ain't lying).<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that proves there can be more to the summer then just big-budget flicks and fancy effects. This proves a movie can make you sing, dance, and feel like on top of the world.<br /><br />Hairspray is by far, one of the best films of the summer.</p></body></html>

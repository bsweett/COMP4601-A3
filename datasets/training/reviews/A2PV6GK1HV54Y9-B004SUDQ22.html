The film is directed by John Madden who also directed Paltrow in her oscar-winning performance, Shakespeare in Love. Proof also stars the legendary actor, Anthony Hopkins, Jake Gyllenhall and Hope Davis. They all play a vital role involving Paltrow's character who feels she is insane like her deceased math genius father (Hopkins). Her character struggles for sanity after the death of her much-respected father. Gyllenhaal's character is a former student of Hopkins and Davis plays Paltow's older sister. I like the ending, how the credits start to flow across the screen before the last scene is even done. Intelligent, low-key film. Check it out some time.</p></body></html>

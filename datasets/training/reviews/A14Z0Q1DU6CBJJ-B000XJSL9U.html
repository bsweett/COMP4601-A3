<meta name="summary" content="1 STAR taken away for SILLY F-35 scene"></head><body><p>For a long time fan of DIE HARD, I was pumped for this movie more than any movie that came out last summer, and I'll be watching this movie over and over and over again.<br /><br />Thankfully, with LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, we don't get a group of terrorists peeling out of doors and walking in formation, or anything ripped from the previous films. The best thing though, is that it creates its own little twist on the 'wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time' theme, instead of copying the original like DIE HARD 2 did.<br /><br />Ultimately, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is a typical summer blockbuster. In a majority of ways it's a cut above the rest, and in other ways, it's as ridiculous and unrealistic as a Devlin, Emmerich or Bay movie.<br /><br />The best thing about the Die Hard movies is that in keeping with the ordinary guy in an extraordinary situation, they've always kept the action scenes SOMEWHAT realistic. I mean, sure, McClaine has done some pretty crazy stunts, but they were always done realistically. Even the leap from the top of the building in the original was pheasible. If he hadn't jumped he would have died. In the third, the subway explosion was a little over the top, and more so, the explosion on the barge. I mean, they've always portrayed McClaine as overly brave, but ultimately vulnerable and most importantly realistic...<br /><br />...until the F35 scene.<br /><br />For that 10 minutes... I thought I was watching a lousy Michael Bay movie as the plane lowers itself perfectly, despite the overpass crumbling all around him and no fighter pilot would fly there in their right mind, except this one, just in the perfect location for McClaine to fall from the truck onto the wing and then miraculously cling to the wing as the plane hovers and dips, as if he had spider skills. (Maybe they knew that Spiderman 3 was their competition)<br /><br />I could go on and on about the ridiculousness of that unnecessary scene. Gotta please the popcorn poppers out there I guess. I mean... he's firing into OVERPASSES at a truck!! First of all... WHY? Second of all... HE'S MISSING!!!<br /><br />With the exception of that scene, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD was outstanding. Thankfully, LIVE FREE has something that most action movies forget about. You can blow up everything in the world and have the coolest over the top action scenes on the planet, but until you have a sympathetic character that the audience can relate to and get behind... you have nothing.<br /><br />With DIE HARD you have it all.</p></body></html>

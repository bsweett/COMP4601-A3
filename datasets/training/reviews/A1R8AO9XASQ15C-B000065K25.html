<meta name="summary" content="Harsh, uncompromising Tarantino"></head><body><p>I would not advise watching this movie with anyone other than a person who has A) a strong stomach, B) a high tolerance for foul language and C) an appreciation for black humor.<p>QT's debut film is a powerful crime drama with images vivid enough to sear holes in your brain. Few directors who have been at work for decades can match the ferocity, passion, and sheer intensity found in Reservoir Dogs. It is an unforgettable experience, whether you ultimately like the movie or not.<p>The acting is first-rate, as usual with a Tarantino film. The dialogue is funny, obscene, insightful and instantly recognizable as QT. As a thriller, this is one tight little number.<p>The only trouble is that Reservoir Dog probably will not age as well as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. Subtlety isn't its strongest point, and it lacks the nuances and character development that Tarantino went on to master. This is not Tarantino's best movie, but with his level of talent, perhaps that's not surprising. Reservoir Dogs was a great place to start, and as a writer and filmmaker, QT has improved tremendously.</p></body></html>

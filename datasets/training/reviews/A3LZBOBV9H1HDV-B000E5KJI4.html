In one of the well made movies of this year, Brad Pitt gives a magnetic performance as Achilles, the emotionally wounded warrior, that is said to be one of the greatest warriors the world has ever seen. Eric Bana gives an equally magnetic performance as Hector, the heir to the throne of Troy, eldest son of King Priam. Orlando Bloom gives a strong performance as Paris, brother of Hector, youngest son of King Priam. The rest of the cast, Brian Cox as Agamemnon, Diane Kruger as Helen, Brendan Gleeson as Menelaus, Sean Bean as Odyseeus, Julie Christie as Thetis, Peter O' Toole as Priam, Saffron Burrows as Andromache, & Rose Byrne as Briseis, give splendid performances.

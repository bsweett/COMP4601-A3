After watching this movie I became a huge Bruce Willis fan because he's amazing in this movie. The man does all of his own stunts and is a 1-guy arsenal of power and strength. The movie is total action from the moment it starts until the second it ends. Bruce plays his signature character John McClane, a New York cop who comes home to LA to visit his estranged wife for Christmas. When he stops by her office to surprise her little does he know that the entire building is about to get sky-jacked courtesy of a gang of money-hungry German terrorists. What I enjoyed the most about Bruce Willis in this film is that he never gives up and he never backs down to the enemy. Even when everyone else is against him and thinks he is a nut he still doesn't give up. If you have any interest in action pictures you must see "Die Hard" because it truly is the very best. I have since seen all of the other "Die Hard" sequels and enjoyed them all immensely because Bruce Willis stayed true to his character throughout every single picture.</p></body></html>

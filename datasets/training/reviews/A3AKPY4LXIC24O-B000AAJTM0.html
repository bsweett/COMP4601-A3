<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Bacon is good.  Pork chops are good.&quot;"></head><body><p>Pulp Fiction was the movie to see in 1994!  A huge ensemble cast, insanely hilarious story(s), a killer soundtrack, and top notch direction from  Quentin Tarantino make this one of the best jaw-dropping films ever!  It's  hard to pick a favorite performance:  There's John Travolta's ultra-cool  (but not to smart when it comes to taking a dump at a potential hit's  apartment) Vincent Vega , way suave with the ladies and super responsible  to the end.  Or there's the scripture spouting, jerry-curl toting Samuel L.  Jackson, the voice of reason who always keeps his cool.  The tough as  nails, don't tread on me, boxer played by Bruce Willis.  The beautiful Uma  Thurman in a heart stopping performance.  Ving Rhames as the violated crime  boss.  Eric Stoltz as the hippy drug dealer.  Tim Roth as the small time  crook.  Harvey Keitel as Mr. Wolf (or is it Mr. Clean).  Tarantino himself  as a way too stressed, slur spewing owner of a garage and some really dorky  clothes.  <p>Extreme in its violence, outlandish in its performances, the  best part of the movie is in the dialogue alone.  Theological discussions  over murder or just a reason not to eat pork the magic in Pulp Fiction lies  in the script!  At least Tarantino wasn't gipped out at the Academy Awards  on that front.  A timeless  classic that is definitely not for the kiddies.  If you don't own the movie or the soundtrack you either weren't born when  this movie came out, aren't human, or have a serious lack of a social life.  A truly essential movie to add to your home collection!</p></body></html>

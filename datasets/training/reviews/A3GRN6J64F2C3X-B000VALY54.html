<meta name="summary" content="Clever tribute to crime pix delivers both laughs and thrills"></head><body><p>"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is one of those humorous takes on the "film noir" genre that wants to have it both ways: it makes clever comments and funny asides about the conventions of the genre (mostly via voiceover narration) while, at the same time, wanting to tell a genuinely involving "noir" story, too.  And I have to say that, for the most part, the film succeeds.  While I'm not as madly in love with this movie as many of the reviewers here, I certainly didn't feel that it's the train wreck some on this site describe it to be.  Discovering this on DVD, I found it to be slick, fun, and clever.  Robert Downey, Jr. and Val Kilmer in particular seem to be having a lot of fun.  The DVD features attractive, slickly designed menus, dynamite picture and sound, and some good extras (including a gag reel that for once is actually fun to watch).  Check this one out.</p></body></html>

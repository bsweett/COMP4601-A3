But even knowing the inevitable outcome doesn't prevent or can't stop you from watching each additional step down the road to perdition.<br />Tom Hanks is a good enough actor to rise above his real and personified usual casting as a good boy; in this movie, he's the hit man for a mobster, but he's also a loving husband and father. Things in his life and that of his family go horribly wrong when his son sees a mob execution and realizes what his father really does.<br />Paul Newman just doesn't make a bad movie, and this is no exception. He plays the aging but still powerful Capo di Tutti Capi, faced with terrifyingly divided loyalties between the weak and useless son who is his by blood, and Hanks, the strong and loyal 'son' who is his by love, affection, and admiration.<br />Horrific scenes of bloodshed, but even more difficult to watch is the inevitable erosion of love and respect between Hanks and Newman as they both ultimately realize that blood is thicker than water.<br />Spectacular, and there's a great cameo bit by Jude Law playing the creepy weird sort of groupie photographer of crime scenes.</p></body></html>

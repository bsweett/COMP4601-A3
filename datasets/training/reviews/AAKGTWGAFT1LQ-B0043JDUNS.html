<meta name="summary" content="Slightly flawed but very entertaining , does what it should well"></head><body><p>Hearing about the (implied) problems the director had with the people from Marvel, who own the rights to the character, one realises we were lucky this film is as good as it is. It is a shame when a film (Iron Man) whose success was uncertain and which was a gamble, but which turned out to be very profitable can be a curse. Everyone involved wants to repeat the success, especially the financial return, but at what cost?<br /><br />I will always be glad we got the first film, which I feel is a classic. I just hope things don't get worse with Iron Man 3 - a lot of us know how sequel quality seems to go downhill, yet we still support them and make up the audience for them - strange, isn't it?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Scotts on the rocks"></head><body><p>Mel Gibson has reached an acting pinnacle, at least so far, with Braveheart. It is an epic movie that is loosely based on historic events in Scotland. All the performances were great and the cinematography was superb. And what a story, so inspirational.<p>The film covers the life of William Wallace from the time he is a small boy, when his Father dies, to his own death. Set mostly in 13th Century Scotland, the story's backdrop is the Scot's struggle against the unjust rule of the English King, Longshanks. The film gradually grows in scope from a small boy's tragedy, to a National conflict spanning generations.<p>After the death of his Father at the hands of the English, William is raised by his uncle who, being a great believer in education, takes William across the world where he learns Latin, French and the manly arts of war. Eventually, he returns to his homeland, a fully mature man, ready to settle down with his childhood sweetheart and raise a family. The concerns of his countrymen over English rule take second place to his pursuit of the beautiful Murron.<p>Due to the half-hearted opposition of Murron's Father and the English noble's rights to take a bride on her wedding night, Wallace is married in secret. The honeymoon doesn't last long before their joy is shattered by the results of an English soldier's attempted rape of Murron. While Wallace is able to beat back the soldiers from his wife, she is captured as they flee in separate directions. The local Lord then decides to bring Wallace into the open by executing his woman in a particularly brutal scene. She is tied to an upright pole and her throat is cut.<p>So starts William Wallace's life long battle against the English to free the people of Scotland. This common man is able to successfully organize the villagers to overthrow the local fort and slaughter the magistrate responsible for the death of his wife. Then, with the help of an adjacent clan, Wallace goes on to tear down the local Lord's temporary castle, and allow one of the cuckolded husbands to take his revenge.<p>Meanwhile King Longshanks is distracted by his war with France and allows his week son an opportunity to prove himself by bringing Wallace to English justice. The Son's ineptness soon leads to full scale battle. A situation that requires the support of the Scottish Lords, an infighting self interested bunch of old men. On the occasion of the first major battle, Wallace is able to maneuver three Lords into helping while stealing the hearts of their levees. Through the use of some brilliant tactics he successfully defeats the English forces and his legend grows to new heights.<p>I won't describe the film much further as it is long and richly detailed. Wallace's successes continue often hampered by betrayal from the Scottish Lords and the treachery of the English King. He finds love again, loses many good friends and eventually finds peace at the hands of the English interrogators. But despite this, Braveheart has a hopeful tone at its end. It makes you feel proud and strong even if you don't have any Scottish heritage.</p></body></html>

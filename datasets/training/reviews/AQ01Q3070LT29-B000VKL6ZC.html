<meta name="summary" content="The final act is different than the original film."></head><body><p>Being a major fan of the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1564428117">Halloween [VHS</a>] (1978), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304288433">Halloween 2 [VHS</a>] (1981), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305531374">Halloween H2O</a> (1998), of course, I had to go to the movie theater to see this remake, Rob Zombie's Halloween (2007).<br />  I was a teenager when the first Halloween (starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence) was out and about, now I'm a mature man with a grown daughter, but I still enjoy the scare of a good horror film.<br />  I have seen all of the other 8 "Halloween" films, but this Rob Zombie's Halloween had constant cursing that disenchanted me and I found the first act and second act less suspenseful than the original John Carpenter's "Halloween".<br />  This 2007 version does give you insight to why Michael Myers killed as a child.  In this version, 10-year old Michael's (Daeg Faerch) home life is not the best. His mother, Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper and the house appears to be unkept. Her boyfriend, Ronnie, (William Forsythe) lives in the house and argues and shows no respect towards 10-year old Michael (Daeg Faerch).<br />  In the original 1978 version, the two-story house was so immaculate, the parents were older and of middle class.<br />  Dare I say, this 2007 film does reflect the way some young people are today and we know of the dysfunctional parents in this day and age too. It makes this film all the more difficult to watch.<br />  When young Michael becomes maniac due to the kids bothering him in school and the abusive nature of his mother's boyfriend, Michael kills his school enemy Wesley (Daryl Sabara), Ronnie, Judith, his own sister (Hanna R. Hall) and her boyfriend, Steve (Adam Weisman). he leaves his baby sister, Laurie Strode, alive.<br />  Laurie Strode as a teenager is played by Scout Taylor-Compton, now in the role made famous by Jamie Lee Curtis in the original "Halloween" movies.<br />  This film does not overshadow the cinematography and direction of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), which is still the best scare and suspense of any Halloween film.<br />  While Rob Zombie's adult "Michael Myers" is more giant, grisly and brutal (played by Tyler Mane), Zombie did open my eyes and made a very daring motion in the final act.<br />  We all know of the chilling ending in the original Halloween (1978), but director/writer Rob Zombie went even further and beyond this point for 15 more minutes. The climax that Rob Zombie added to his ending was very new, fresh and so suspenseful, I was on the edge of my seat.  The last 15 minutes surprised me and the last minute twist was fantastic. It left you wanting more.<br />  Of all the "Halloween" films, only Danielle Harris, from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA57UI">Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers (Divimax Edition)</a> (1988), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA57US">Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers (Divimax Edition)</a> (1989), makes an appearance in this 2007 film as a different character "Annie Brackett".<br /><br />  Also in the film:<br />  Leslie Easterbrook, Sid Haig, Brad Dourif, Udo Kier, Skyler Gisomdo, Sybil Danning.<br />  Danny Trejo (Runaway train (1985), Death Wish 4: The Crackdown (1987), Grindhouse (2007)/Grindhouse (2007), Machete (2010).<br />  Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead 1978,2004).<br />  Dee Wallace (The Howling 1981, E.T.

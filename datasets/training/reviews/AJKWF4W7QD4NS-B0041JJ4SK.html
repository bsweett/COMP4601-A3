<meta name="summary" content="Better and funnier than one would expect"></head><body><p>After best buds Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) partake in some herbal refreshment one night, the pair decide to cure their munchies fix with a visit to White Castle.  This is the premise for Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, and while it's hardly anything on paper, the film manages to be better and funnier than one would expect it to be.  Along the way, they encounter a twisted fast food employee (Anthony Anderson), an inbred tow truck driver (Law & Order: SVU's Christopher Meloni), and even Neil Patrick Harris, whose performance and delivery are so off the wall it must be seen to be believed.  It wears thin towards the end, but for the most part Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle is a very funny buddy/stoner comedy with a touch of social commentary and mild homophobia to boot.  As long as you don't take it seriously, you'll enjoy it, and by the time it's over, you'll be craving some White Castle too.</p></body></html>

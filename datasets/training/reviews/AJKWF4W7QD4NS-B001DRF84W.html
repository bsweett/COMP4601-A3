<meta name="summary" content="Ultimately, and sadly, disappointing"></head><body><p>Maybe I should have known better than to have high expectations I did for The Hulk, but considering the cast involved and who's sitting in the director's chair perhaps my expectations were justified.  But despite all the hype and the big names, this big screen mega budget adaptation of The Hulk is ultimately disappointing.  Eric Bana, who gave us such memorable lead characterizations in Chopper and Black Hawk Down, just seems a bit out of place as Bruce Banner: the man struggling to supress the beast within.  Jennifer Connelly, who gets more and more beautiful the older she gets, is a fine choice as Betty Ross, while Sam Elliot (who plays her father General Ross) overacts quite a bit and seems a bit out of place as well.  Nick Nolte however, gives the best performance in the film as Bruce's psychotic father.  Director Ang Lee's use of using split frame shots (like in comic books to fully illustrate scenes) is a nice idea, but it does get quite annoying.  Everyone seems to automatically nitpick the special effects and the CGI creation of the Hulk, but the big green machine himself is superbly animated and designed; and in a few shots actually looks real.  The action scenes themselves are superbly put together as well throughout the first three quarters of the film; up until the climax and finale of the film where the movie turns into an incoherent cartoon.  For me, that is where the film really fell apart, with the final fight scene and climax plus predictable ending which naturally sets the stage for the Hulk to smash and bash his way towards a sequel.  All in all, The Hulk is an ultimately disappointing mega budget miss that aimed high, but fell well below radar.  Go watch X2: X-Men United again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Express Gains Steam as It Goes Along"></head><body><p>For maybe the first half of "The Polar Express" I was ready to dismiss it as a film more concerned with visual effects at the expense of good storytelling and character developement.  Not exactly a lump of coal but a disappointment considering the talent involved(Robert Zemeckis, Tom Hanks).  Once the train  reached it's destination, the North Pole, is when the film for me began to gel.  It is at this juncture of the film where the characters, CGI though they may be, develope identities and you start to empathize with them.  The film's message of believing in the spirit of Christmas was palpable and not some cynical catchphrase.  What accounts for the film's split personality?  My guess is that in fleshing out a thin illustrated children's book to feature length the filmmakers didn't have enough material so they compensated with visual fluorishes.  On the whole this is a nice picture that falls short of being a great film.</p></body></html>

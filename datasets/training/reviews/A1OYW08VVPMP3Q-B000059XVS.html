<meta name="summary" content="An epic"></head><body><p>A sweeping look at a man who was made by the Great War.<br /><br />Lawrence, a scholar and archeologist prior to the war (something the movie seems to miss) was sent by the British to assist the Arabs who were at that time revolting against their Ottoman masters. The British hoped that an Arab revolt would draw resources away from the Egyptian frontier and from Mesopotamia, allowing the allies to invade the Turkish homeland.<br /><br />Lawrence, working with Prince Faisal, did manage to organize the Arabs after a fashion to attack the Turks but the Arabs were using the British as much as the British were using the Arabs. The difference was that the British had much more far-reaching goals for the region.<br /><br />The movie is a great action film but not necessarily great history. But it is a winderful movie to sit down and watch. Lawrence was successful because he took up the Arab cause as his own. His exploits also served Allied propaganda at a time when everything was stalled on the Western Front.<br /><br />As an aside, Lawrence could not live with being the hero portrayed by the Allies. He tried to get away from the person everyone thought he was.</p></body></html>

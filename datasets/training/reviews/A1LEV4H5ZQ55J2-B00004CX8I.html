<meta name="summary" content="A Fantasatic Jack Nicholson"></head><body><p>A heart wrenching story of an unruly inmate (Jack Nicholson) trying to bring dignity to the lives of other inmates living in the same mental institution. However, Nurse Ratchet is there to oppose him, to make him think, to stop the provocation.<br /><br />Jack plays a likeable fellow and finds ways to do things like take them out of the institution for an afternoon boat ride. The authorities at the institution become sorely tired of his unruliness and the distress he causes, but Jack's influences have worn off. Albeit, too late for Jack.<br /><br />The clever screen play provides laughs intended to provoke the establishment--a favorite pastime of the 1970's. The dialogue between inmates is excellent. Can't be beat.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie with an extra DVD that includes many features.</p></body></html>

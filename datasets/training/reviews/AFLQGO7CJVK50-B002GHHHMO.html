Do not ever watch this movie at night or alone. I MEAN IT. The thing that makes this even more scary(if that's possible!) is that it actually happens and is making a comeback! Rated R is an understatement! Test your faith. Prove your supernatural strength. That is what this movie was made for. Literally. Ever fight a demon-possessed person? Ever try to get rid of the demon in them? Leave it to the experts but if you want to test yourself in a somewhat safe environment, this is the movie. I MEAN IT.</p></body></html>

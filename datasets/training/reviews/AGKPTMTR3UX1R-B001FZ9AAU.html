Based on the Marvel Comics series about industrialist Tony Stark who builds a metallic suit chock full of high-tech gadgetry and dedicates his life to saving the world, IRON MAN is a witty and intelligent action film.<br /><br />Downey is near perfect playing the multibillionaire Stark. One minute he is the Playboy of The Western World a la James Bond. The next minute he rivals Al Pacino's Tony Montana of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AMRJC">Scarface</a> for crassness. He is a workaholic, a hedonist, and an eccentric loner, whose only close relationship is with his secretary, Pepper Potts, played here by Gwyneth Paltrow.<br /><br />Beautiful yes, but more so translucently lovely, Ms. Paltrow has an inborn grace that softly overwhelms the viewer. To date, this reviewer has seen that quality of elegance onscreen only in actress Natalie Portman and in Ms. Paltrow's own mother, Blythe Danner. Paltrow's competent but feminine Pepper therefore, is the perfect counterpoint to Downey's brash Iron Man.<br /><br />In this version, Stark is wounded by terrorists. Escaping, he takes on the Iron Man persona and returns to wreak vengeance. Unfortunately, the terrorists are being aided by a business rival of Stark Industries, who builds a similar suit and engages Iron Man in a battle for New York City.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a cut above most Superhero films, a real Summer Movie. Marvel is constantly perfecting their cinematic craft.</p></body></html>

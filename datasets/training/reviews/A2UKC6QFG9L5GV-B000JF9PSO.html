The radio in the cab was on and the driver told me: "You know, they say an airliner rammed into one of the twin towers in New York". My first thought was: "How is that possible? You can't hit a skyscraper with an airplane, they don't fly that low over NYC. Even in case of emergency they'd rather make it into Hudson river" - as one of the characters of United 93 says. Some time later while I was still in the taxi we heard about the second plane that hit the southern tower. Right off I understood it's a terrorist attack, but still I had this feeling of irreality about what was going on. Even when I got home, turned on the TV and saw both WTC buildings on fire, I couldn't believe my own eyes. "That's impossible - I thought - that just can't be. It only happens in movies". 9/11 was the day everyone understood such things might happen in real life also. It was the first day that sent previous era to past - era of world's relative serenity and carelessness. From that day on we all suspect our telephone calls are being eavesdropped, we have to take off our shoes in airports, and some of us are even being bombed.<br /><br />This total tranquility is conveyed great in the beginning of United 93. The last calm hours or even minutes before the world changed are shown so objectively and impartially as if the filmmakers don't know themselves what's going to happen. And this lull is so frightening from today's perspective. Paul Greengrass made a great film which looks almost as a documentary and which derives much of its power from this fact. This is not a heroic, epic tale of survival and struggle, it's a quiet story about ordinary people who once woke up in hell and just like us refused to believe it all was true. But they had to fight to stay alive and these common people who were on the United 93 - managers, secretaries, sportsmen or whoever else were there - fought to stop this madness. Paul Greengrass took a viewer 5 years back and let him observe everything not from his armchair in front of the TV, but to actually BE there and to experience all the terror and anguish himself. And he succeeded indeed. There are no well-known actors in United 93 so that we can feel all the characters are real people just like us, one of the few familiar faces here is David Rasche, and we catch at him like people on the plane were grasping at him as at a straw because he (as a pilot) was their only hope to survive this nightmare. But although we hope till the very last minute that passangers will manage to win this fight, we are thrown into despair even deeper realizing we already know the outcome.<br /><br />United 93 is an utterly powerful and impressive picture. Probably the best way to pay the tribute to all the people who lost their lives on 9/11. And Paul Greengrass, being a good director, understood he didn't need a blockbuster with Bruce Willis to do that. He just needed a small, modest movie that almost like a documentary showed us real people in extraordinary circumstances and made us feel at least a grain of what they must have felt that day. This movie is recommended to everyone with no exceptions for it's one of the most potent pictures you'll ever see.</p></body></html>

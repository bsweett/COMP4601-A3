I sympathize with Mr. Colbert.  I'd buy and watch anything Clive Owen has done, even that series of high-octane BMW commercials he did back in 2001 and 2002.  There's something about his snarly amiability, his capacity to take the conventionally wry Leading Man attitude and give it a dose of sheltered vulnerability that plays like snarky ambivalence.  But mostly I just want him to hold me.<br /><br />Ha ha ha.  Eh.  Okay, well, all of that having been said, this movie?  Not very good.<br /><br />"Derailed" is, indeed, a clever little thriller, but it's too big for its britches.  The story sprawls so much that its contrivances seem awkward, and its twists seem more like flow-stopping kinks.  Penned by Stuart Beattie after the man had already given us "Collateral" and the first "Pirates of the Caribbean," "Derailed" lacks the tight plotting and character-driven nuances of either of those movies.<br /><br />Our story follows a fellow named Charles Schine (Clive Owen) who chances to meet a lovely stranger named Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston) on his train ride to work.  The two flirt with that sort of soft-toned abrasiveness that comes so easily to the executives of the World of Moviedom (both Schine and Harris' jobs are your typically ill-defined filmic pablum; what they do never matters as much as the fact that its lucrative).  Before they know it, they're slumming it in a moth-eaten motel room and gettin' it on, as they say.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only one who gets it off, as they say, is the guy who breaks into their room, robs them, and then does unspeakable things in the interim.  The encounter is, indeed, hard to watch, stomach-churning, even if the robber (Vincent Cassel packing his chops with as much cheese as he can) keeps uttering the sort of unimaginative drivel that most movie villains utter in the midst of their bad behavior.  Ah, but can I blame a low life like this for being uncreative?<br /><br />Yes, I can, actually.  Our low life, LaRoche, is actually pretty smart, because the hotel room is just the beginning.  LaRoche, realizing he's attacked a couple of very soft, very wealthy targets, cranks things up a notch, turns the screws, puts the pressure on, ups the ante, hits close to home, ADD METAPHOR HERE.<br /><br />What really ruins "Derailed" is its schizophrenic pacing.  Owen is at his greatest when his character has reached an interlude, when a decision must be made.  You can see the dark calculus of his thoughts on his well-angled face, and when he reaches his conclusion, the actions he takes are just an extension of those ruminations.  However, in "Derailed," those moments seem to last forever.  Furthermore, Owen's character is so stupid, so weak, and so spineless, it's hard, by the end, to care what happens to him and his wife and his Dying Daughter (who could be cured by a miraculous new drug that costs as much as Tanzania, apparantly, and for which the Schine's have been saving for seven years; this is known as an Emotional Plug-in).<br /><br />It's great that Owen plays against type in this movie; I'm not faulting him for that.  I am, however, faulting the film for the character it has chosen to place at its center.  Schine's transgressions are understandable, I suppose, and so is his habit of burying all of his problems under a pile of money.  But his actions at the end, the logical leaps he makes in the interim, it's all choreographed inconvenience.  From the cops who inexplicably berate him for not buying a hooker, to LaRoche's perpetually-scowling partner-in-crime (Xzibit, who uses the same facial expression in every frame of the film), to Schine's mail boy, Winston Boyko, an ex-con who still steals from time to time and even has, as a keepsake, the first shiv he ever used to stab someone with (played with companionable charm by RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan): it's all hokey and eye-rolling.<br /><br />Of course, the entire movie would fail to exist if Schine would do the one sensible thing and go to the cops, but the script takes great pains to explain why he shouldn't, wouldn't, and doesn't do this.  I never really bought it.  In fact, the further along the film went, the less I bought.  Too much of the movie tries to be clever, tries to circle around into itself.  Its a pile of plot-threads, a tangled mess of consequences and coincidences, and even the great Clive Owen can't save it.<br /><br />But he can still hold me whenever he wants.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Amazing Film!"></head><body><p>This happens to be my favorite Hitchcock film.<br /><br />The DVD is great.  There are interviews and extras galore!<br /><br />This is considered Hitchcock's most personal film.  I think it might have something to do with the fact that almost the entire film is shown solely from Jimmy Stewart's perspective.<br /><br />Scotty has had an accident and discovers he has vertigo.  Almost simultaneously, an old friend calls upon him to follow the Mrs.  Apparently she slips into trances that take her back to another time (and into insanity!).  But complications arise as Scotty realizes his attraction to her has little to do with the job ...<br /><br />This is a movie I watch over and over again.  The funny thing is, I have talked to many others who have the same obsessive reaction to it as well.<br /><br />Give it one viewing, and you will be hooked.</p></body></html>

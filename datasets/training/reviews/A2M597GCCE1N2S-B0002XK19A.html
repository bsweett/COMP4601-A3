I thought it was rather dumb, but after watching the first movie on DVD I was surprised by how well done it was. So in order to make sure I saw the second movie on the big screen I immediately went out and waited almost two hours to see the second one on the day it came out. And it did not disappoint......<br /><br />This movie picks up where Peter Parker [Tobey McGuire], aka spiderman, is now doing. Although the first movie showed how much fun Parker was having, the second movie goes into detail on how the super powers can take its toll on the young guy. Parker is falling behind in his classes from lack of sleep, his teachers are concerned and want him to do better.<br /><br />Then to add insult to injury his job isn't exactly great also. Some of the opening scenes have him racing to try and get a pizza to a costumer on time, only to be a few minutes late. Can't win them all the time! And probably the biggest pressure is one that gets us all, love. Parker realizes that he is in love with his best friend, Mary Jane [Kirsten Dundst], but cant seem to get it off his chest. One memerable scene is that he tells his friend how much he loves her, only to say it to the dead end of a telephone reciever.<br /><br />Of course this is right on time when an evil villan is about to make his grand entrance. Alfred Molina gives a surprisingly great role as Dr. Octopus, a man with four seemingly invincible metal arms that are attached to his spine after a horrendous accident.  He first doesn't want to be evil, his plan was to get the arms off him. However, something gets inside his head, and he realizes he needs to steal money in order to get the parts for his machine that he needs.<br /><br />Basically that is the main plot, Parker struggles to clear things out of his head, and Dr. Octopus turns to a life of crime. But that isn't all, the son of the Green Goblin, the main villan from the first blockbuster show, wants spiderman dead, for revenge on what spiderman did to his dad. And the ironic twist is that he is also Parker's best buddy, who could have seen that coming?<br /><br />All in all, this is a fantastic movie, dont listen to that idiot who says that the two moives suck, they are anything but bad. The  special effects are brilliant, and it truly is one of the best superhero movie ever made. Lots of intense fight scenes, my favorite one being on the train, and an emotional decision by Dr. Octopus at the end are fantastic.<br /><br />And did I mention the fact that Tobey McGuire gives an absolutely credible performance as the nerd by day Parker, and the awsome spiderman by night? Lots of great and suspensful scenes guarantees that this movie will never get boring, so buy it when it comes out on DVD!</p></body></html>

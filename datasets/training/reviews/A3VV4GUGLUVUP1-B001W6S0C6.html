Sure, they had to sculpt a rubber muscle-suit (would the Dark Knight really wear something that so restricts his head movement and peripheral vision?), but as soon as he starts talking in Batman's harsh whisper, you believe. <p> Unfortunately, much of this beautifully designed film is given over to Jack Nicholson's role as the Joker. He looks like he's having fun, and obviously director Tim Burton is enjoying it, but many of his scenes run way too long and a lot of his ad-libbing falls flat. Nicholson doesn't quite make his Joker frightening enough, and we're left with a performance that's half Jack's devil from &quot;Witches of Eastwick&quot; and half Cesar Romero's campy, mustachioed Joker from the 60's tv show. <p> Burton manages to avoid overt camp (why do directors always have to make fun of this sort of material as if they're so much above it, when obviously they're NOT), but the pace drags as he indulges his more precious tendencies a bit too much. The scene where the Joker holds a one-way conversation with a dead crony doesn't really play, and there are too many scenes that exist only because Burton thinks the imagery is hauntingly beautiful- although this is correct in the scene where a rushing Batmobile sends fall leaves blowing in its wake. Despite its langorous pace, flat attempts at humor and Batman's over-reliance on gadgets and sfx, Burton and company manage to produce a visually striking film that rivals Ridley Scott's &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and Fritz Lang's &quot;Metropolis&quot; for inventiveness. The more street-level action sequences work surprisingly well, and Kim Basinger really brightens up the film's darker elements. <p>  All in all, it's well-worth seeing for comic book fans, but falls short of the precedent set by &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; and the brilliant, virtually perfect &quot;Batman: The Animated Series,&quot; which is one offspring of this movie which more than justifies any of the parent's flaws.</p></body></html>

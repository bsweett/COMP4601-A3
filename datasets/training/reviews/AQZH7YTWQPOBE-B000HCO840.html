<meta name="summary" content="A fitting conclusion"></head><body><p>I've been pleased with the X-Men series overall, and X-Men United is a fitting end to the trilogy. The plot is a bit far-fetched - Jean Grey being an all-powerful super mutant - but it does up the ante (including one memorable death scene). My only complaint is that I wish it had been longer - it seems as if the film is rushed in only 100 minutes. Otherwise, if you liked the first two, you'll love this one.</p></body></html>

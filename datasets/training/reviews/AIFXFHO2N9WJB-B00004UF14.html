<meta name="summary" content="Protecting the Earth From the Worst Scum of the Universe..."></head><body><p>After gaining box office and critical praise for his work in the smash hit "Independence Day", actor Will Smith was riding high as one of Hollywood's newest box office sensations. So, what does someone in that position do for a follow-up performance, perhaps something small, maybe an independent feature or something of the sort...on second thought, that wouldn't be Will Smith's style, so what did he do to follow-up his big screen success? Well, he went on to co-star alongside Tommy Lee Jones ("The Fugitive") in director Barry Sonenfeld's surprising sci-fi comedy hit "Men in Black".<br /><br />"Men in Black" is the story of a secret government organization whose job is to monitor and police extraterrestrial activity on Earth. Their agents are chosen from the best that government training has to offer, they work in secret, and most likely you'll never even know they existed. But when an NYPD detective (Will Smith) encounters an alien, he finds himself cast into the middle of an alien war that the 'MIB' are trying to prevent from spilling over onto Earth. With the help and training of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), this former cop is about to get a crash course in what it means to be the last line of defense against the worst scum of the universe.<br /><br />Now, here is a case where a movie gets released and catches everyone off guard. Upon its release there were not too many people that knew much about "Men in Black", there were some that were aware of the little-known comic book, but most just thought it looked like a funny movie with Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith against a bunch of aliens. More than likely the film would prove to be entertaining and possibly worthy of owning later on, but nothing all that original. Boy, were we wrong or what? "Men in Black" was incredibly entertaining, from the action to the sci-fi to the hilarious comedy spread throughout, there was never a dull moment in this movie, and the box office returns and praise from both audiences and critics were proof of just how good this movie truly was.<br /><br />The performances by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones were enjoyable, their banter/bickering was always fun to listen to, and still is even after multiple viewings. Linda Fiorentino ("The Last Seduction") and Vincent D'Onofrio ("Law and Order: Criminal Intent") were excellent in their supporting roles, especially Vincent who was spectacular, and even creepy as an alien hiding out in a decaying human body. A few brief appearances by Rip Torn as the head of 'MIB', Zed, provided some humorous moments, especially in the scenes with the aliens known as the 'worm guys'.<br /><br />The story for "Men in Black" was probably the most surprising aspect of the movie, it was a rather basic plot wrapped in a very original package of a government organization tracking aliens hiding among us here on Earth. It's refreshing to see a movie where the writers were able to take a plotline that has been used many times over, the aging veteran must train a new partner who in turn becomes his replacement, and place it into a story that is full of energy, action, humor, and originality making for an incredibly enjoyable movie experience that audiences will want to go through again and again.<br /><br />If you enjoy action comedies or science fiction films then here is a movie that should entertain you from start to finish. Aside from a little bit of language and a few gross scenes that may scare younger viewers, this is a movie that for the most part the entire family can sit down and enjoy, if nothing else it seems to be aired regularly on TV so you can always see the slightly edited version without the grossness and language.<br /><br />"Men in Black" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></body></html>

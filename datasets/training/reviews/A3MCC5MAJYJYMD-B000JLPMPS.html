<meta name="summary" content="Bogged down by manly talk."></head><body><p>'Unforgiven' is a good story which is bogged down by too much manly talk.  Gene Hackman, of course, gives the best performance as a paranoid, dictatorial sheriff of the town of Old Whiskey.  After kicking English Bob unconscious, Hackman is at his absolute scariest.  But the scenes with Clint Eastwood are boorish and embarrasing.  The worst is when Morgan Freeman asks  Eastwood if he misses sex.  It is supposed to be funny, but is unnecessary and bad.  The film tries to make Eastwood, who was once an assasin,  look like some born-again saint.  Although it is plausable, I found it hard to believe because Eastwood was both the director and main actor.<br />The plot is about three assasins who are supposed to to kill one man.  This man has slashed a woman's face, but wasn't punished for it.  The film has some tense moments, espicially the final shootout between one man and an entire bar full of people (even though it was very unrealistic).  'Unforgiven' has a lot of talk about past shootouts and how once Eastwood was the best dualer of them all.  Then there is more talk about some other shootouts.  Some may find that interesting, but to me it was just boorish.  See it for Hackman's performance though.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Halle Berry can't save this one..."></head><body><p>Where to start, where to start?  "Catwoman" is simply horrible, there is nothing in this movie that makes it worth watching, not even Halle Berry.  The story is simple and too stupid to be put into any film, the characters are paper-thin, and the CGI effects work is the worst.  I watched the movie all the way through, hoping it would at some point become interesting, but it never does.  If for some reason you are still interested in what this movie is about then read the next paragraph, if all you want is to read about how bad it is, then skip the next paragraph and read on.<br /><br />"Catwoman" of course is based on the character from DC Comics, she is a cat-burglar with an obsession for all things feline (hence the name).  Commonly used as a villain for Batman and at the same time a lover or sorts for Batman.  This movie pretty much ignores everything about Batman, and Catwoman's origins from the comics.  In fact, there are no references to Batman at all in this film.  The story goes like this, Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) works for a cosmetic firm, that is secretly making cosmetics that cause people to deteriorate and therefore, require more makeup from the same company.  Patience discovers this plot and is killed for her discovery, only to be resurrected by cats.  Now Patience has returned to life, but she's more cat-like than human, she likes kitty litter, sleeping on the roof, really stupid stuff that the director and writer probably thought would be cool in the movie but comes off laughable.  Patience eventually turns to crime and dons various costumes to become Catwoman before settling on the final costume which every guy that has seen a commercial or poster for this film knows very well.  It's the bikini top, with shredded leather pants, and a crappy looking mask.  For the most part the moment Halle dons this costume is the best part in the entire film, because this costume really shows off Halle's "assets", which is about the only redeeming quality in this film.  Once this happens of course we are led into the final showdown between Catwoman and the villain of the film (I don't remember her name, but she's played by Sharon Stone).  After the fight the movie ends and Catwoman is left roaming the streets hoping to get a sequel, but God-wiling that will never happen, and the audience runs out of the theater threatening to sue the director, who goes by the name "Pitof" for stealing 90 minutes of their life away.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is simply terrible, one would think that Halle Berry being an Oscar winner would do a better job, but of course she didn't have much to work with here.  Really she shouldn't have even chosen to do this film, I mean to go from Oscar winner to this is terrible.  Sharon Stone, who for some reason is shown in this movie with what appears to be a soft glow around her, possibly to hide her wrinkles, is laughable as the villain.  Hopefully Sharon's return to her greatest character, Catherine Tremmel in "Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction" will be much better.  Benjamin Bratt as a cop chasing Catwoman and as Patience's love interest is worthless in this film.  The CGI work is beyond horrible, in this modern age of technology and with all of the great special effects used in movies, you would think they would have done a better job.  I mean, it was so obvious every time they used CGI in this film, it was even used for some of the scenes of Catwoman walking around.<br /><br />Overall, a terrible movie with a beautiful lead actress that should have known better than to say yes to this picture.  I would not recommend watching this movie at all, not even if you are wanting to make fun of a movie, there are plenty of other bad movies that are still watchable that you can make fun of, this one is just not worth the jokes you could throw at it.<br /><br />If for some reason, you do decide to watch this movie, here is the reason it is rated PG-13.<br /><br />"Catwoman" is rated PG-13 for stylized violence, language, and sexuality.</p></body></html>

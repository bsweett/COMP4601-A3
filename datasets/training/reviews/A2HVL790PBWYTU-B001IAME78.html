But let's not twist it, Bruce Banner suddenly isn't some happy-go-lucky bloke. He's still pretty damn tormented, he and his alter ego still the modern incarnations of Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Nomad scientist Bruce Banner will always be teeteering on the edge of losing control. Else, what's the point of his character? Just like he'll always be on a quest for a cure. And just like he'll always fail to find one.<br /><br />As a nod to Ang Lee's HULK and its conclusion, this one opens up with Bruce Banner still in Brazil, but now toiling as a day laborer in a soda-bottling plant. In his ongoing efforts to dampen his emotions, he's even resorted to taking martial arts lessons (not that Bruce becomes a wushu master or anything). He's got a watch which monitors his heart rate (any number nearing 200 beats is a worrisome thing).<br /><br />For a bit now, Bruce has been corresponding via e-mail with a Mr. Blue (can you guess what Bruce's code color is?). Mr. Blue has been assisting him with his latest attempt at a cure. But it's not too long of a wait before Bruce learns that the cure, isn't. In the short term, though, that's the least of his worries. General Ross has finally tracked him down and he mobilizes a strike force to fetch Banner.<br /><br />The film makes a point of keeping a running tally of Days Without Incident onscreen, the latest reading being 158 days. Ooops. Reset the count.<br /><br />I do think that Norton improves on Eric Bana, but I prefer Sam Elliott to William Hurt as the cold-hearted General Ross. And I think it's a wash between Jennifer Connelly and Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler is hotness on legs, and, as Betty Ross, she does well with the emotional, pining scenes. But I don't quite believe her as a biologist (she's a friggin' elf, isn't she?). But she and Norton produce some good chemistry, and you even buy into the tender Beauty & the Beast moments with her and the Hulk. Banner's core persona is marked by repression, by a tamping down of emotions. What's left is this husk desperate to stay even-keeled and unengaged and still. In a sexy and funny bedroom scene between Bruce and Betty, we learn that it's not only fear and rage which may trigger the change. Bruce, no matter what, just cannot afford to get too excited (Betty protests: "Not even a little excited?"). Thankfully, Norton is able to bring out nuances and some liveliness to Banner, even if much of the acting has to be done internally. But there's only so much you can do with that. Bill Bixby, bless his soul, got the most out of all the actors to have ever played this role. Still, the Hulk usually has to pick up the slack, and he doesn't do this thru snappy dialogue and fancy emoting.<br /><br />The movie is still character driven, but much more accessible than the Ang Lee adaptation. THE INCREDIBLE HULK benefits most from driving up the pace. This film is more action oriented and showcases more of what makes the Hulk so much fun. Know your audience, says the box office guru. And the Hulk's audience clamors for the mean, green monster to break stuff and demolish a bad guy or two. Maybe occasionally yell out: "Hulk is strongest one there is!" or "Hulk smash!"  No one takes to a rampage quite like the Hulk, and that's the candy we crave.<br /><br />General Ross is the recurring villain, but the main adversary for the Hulk here is Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), a veteran paramilitary operative who envies the power unleashed by the Hulk. Of course, the old science-gone-mad schtick enters the picture, framed in General Ross's scheme to dust off the ancient super soldier project. Risky experimentations enable cellular changes within Emil Blonsky, who soon mutates to freakish, super strong stature. I don't think the film officially labels him this, but Emil Blonsky becomes the Abomination, one of the Hulk's perennial adversaries in the comics. His clash with the Hulk is of epic proportions, brutal and earth-shaking, and taking place in the crowded New York streets. There is much fan joy here.<br /><br />No disrespect to Bruce Banner, Betty and General Ross, but the film perks up most, obviously, whenever the Hulk manifests. While I did like how Ang Lee's Hulk was CG'd, this new version looks better, more ferocious and somehow more grounded to reality, more fixed into his surroundings. He's featured in three pulse-pounding action set pieces, the best of which is the aforementioned Hulk Vs. Abomination shatterfest (although the other two segments ain't nothing to sneeze at, either).<br /><br />Keep an eye out for the film's fond winks to Lou Ferrigno, Stan Lee, and the late Bill Bixby, as well as a tongue-in-cheek take on Banner's famous line. Also, I'm digging the coda scene, as a character from another Marvel Comics title pops in for a cameo and with a very significant offer to General Ross. More fan joy, indeed.<br /><br />The other day, in one of those throwaway stream-of-consciousness conversations one sometimes gets into, someone was asking me whether Bruce Banner prefers briefs or boxers. I broke it down for her.</p></body></html>

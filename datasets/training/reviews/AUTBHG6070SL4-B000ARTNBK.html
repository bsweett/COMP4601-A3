<meta name="summary" content="Lots to like about this movie"></head><body><p>The popcorn was pretty good, the air-conditioned theater felt great on a steamy July evening, and Jessica Alba is really cute.<br /><br />Oh, right, the movie. Um, Jessica Alba was cute. And, um, Jess -- wait, I said that already.<br /><br />The first 3/4 of the movie is mostly nothing. Nothing much happens, then they go to a space station. There's a cosmic storm, and nothing much happens and they go home. Then everyone start turning weird, but nothing much happens. Then there's a big fight and the bad guy loses but he doesn't completely lose so we can have a sequel. The end.<br /><br />Johnny Storm is an insufferable egotist with a forethought horizon measured in milliseconds. Testosterone driven teenaged boys will relate. Sue Storm (Jessica) is the director of bio-something at a billion dollar corporation and fitting mate for gray haired Reed Richards, despite her pouty seventeenish demeanor. Ben Grimm was true to the F4 I remember from years ago, but his lovely romantic interest seemed to be tacked on at the end. Alicia (Kerry Washington) is a charmer though, so I won't complain.<br /><br />It's a silly-season summer flick. If you're a pureblood Marvel fan-boy [-girl], it's a must see movie. If you have a small boy, you'll be dragged to see it. Otherwise, wait til it shows up in rentals and you've seen everything else at the store.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Inspirational yes, a bit slow though"></head><body><p>The real life story of Chris Gardner is an inspiration, those were very difficult times for most of America and we prevailed, Chris prevailed even more so than the rest of us.  Will Smith has become an excellent actor worth following and his son did a fine job on his first time out.<br /><br />I agree that this movie comes to an abrute conclusion and would have liked to seen more of his success and the success of his son, but I have a feeling that would lead to disappointment.<br /><br />My family enjoyed watching and I will probably watch it a couple more times, but don't see it as my go to movie for getting me out of a rute or inspiring me to do great things, just the things that I have to do.</p></body></html>

Besides, you get Berry in that Catwoman suit (Berry continues to provide some jaw dropping moments in cinema.) as well as a fight scene with Sharon Stone who coulda been a Catwoman condender herself. S'More for the Daddies in the family than for the kids...Again, I'd like to say if there's a movie made of a famous comic book character, count on these *experts* to debunk the product because it doesn't fit their mind's eye after years of studying the character....if the director doesn't exhibit some degree of pretension or geekiness, these *experts* make it harder on some productions. Bump that. See this for yourself and draw your own conclusions.</p></body></html>

That being said, THE WICKER MAN still furnishes entertainment in spades because it is so glaringly BAD.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage, as a stressed out cop looking for a missing girl on a remote and mysterious Puget Sound island is bad; creepy Kate Beahan as Cage's ex love interest and the mother of the missing child is bad; Ellen Burstyn, who is aging wonderfully and gracefully, but as the island's nutty cult leader is bad; and Molly Parker as the local manhating school teacher is bad.  Cage screams, Beahan looks confused, Burstyn smirks, Parker puts on a bird mask.<br /><br />There. . .just saved you a couple of bucks from Netflix.<br /><br />Seriously, from the wacky dialogue to gaping plot inconsistencies to Cage's ranting to just plain silliness, this flick begs the question:  Don't these guys know they're making a clinker?  And if they do, they're giving us bad filmmaking worth one knee-slapping howl after another.  (I still haven't stopped laughing from the sight of Cage running around in a bear outfit.)  THE WICKER MAN deserves only one star, but because it's so bad it actually entertains I'll give it two.  Pass that bird mask.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interesting But Not Worth The Call"></head><body><p>This film starring Colin Farrell is interesting at best but doesn't quite fill the bill.<p>Farrell does a great job running through every emotion possible while being stuck in a NY city phone booth at the mercy of a creepy voiced sniper (played by Keifer Sutherland). But the film stays incomplete because nothing is ever explained. Why did the sniper pick him? What is the sniper's motivation? Had the motives been explained it may have been a hit.<p>Don't waste a dime on this DVD, wait until you can catch it on TV unless you are a true Colin Farrell fan.</p></body></html>

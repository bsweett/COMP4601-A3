<meta name="summary" content="Stargate"></head><body><p>The director/producer team of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, who gave us Independance Day and Godzilla [ ] first produced this inventive and exciting Sci Fi flick. I'm not usually a fan of this genre, but this one is actually rather good compared with traditional science fiction. Starring Kurt Russell and James Spader, the film is basically a homage (French for "rip-off") of the old Sci Fi stories, but there are some interesting ideas and a series of terrific action set-pieces.  The story consists of an Egyptologist who discovers the secret of an ancient relic called the Stargate. The explorer solves the puzzle and then he and a team of soldiers enter the Stargate and discover a city of people who are descendants of the ancient Egyptians. The people worship gods who are actually an alien culture, and then the trouble begins. Great stuff. Dissapointing DVD extras though, with only production notes. One hopes this will be re-released in a "Special Edition" soon.</p></body></html>

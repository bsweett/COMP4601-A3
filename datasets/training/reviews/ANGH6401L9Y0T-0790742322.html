So it came as no surprise to me that this movie was both warped and hilariously funny.<br /><br />Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) are a charming young couple that live in a large old house on the edge of a small town. They love each other very much, very playful and fun together, and have just settled in for three weeks of vacation to work on their hobby: a scale model of the entire town. It's really good, too. Also, apparently they renovated the old house themselves.<br /><br />One day they went into town to get some supplies for the model and on the way home, went through a covered bridge. That is, through the side of the covered bridge into the river. They found themselves back at home, but eventually realized that they had died and were now haunting the place. That would be OK, except that their neighbor, a real estate agent, promptly sold the place to the Deetz, a severely dysfunctional family from the city. In no time at all, the wife has thrown out all the comfortable old things Adam and Barbara had, and put in horrible modern junk based on the dreadful tastes of her friend, an interior decorator. Also on her own sculptures, which are arguably the ugliest things you have ever seen produced by anyone over the age of five.<br /><br />The only redeeming aspect of the Deetz family is their teenage daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). She dresses in black, is very morbid, but also is the only one able to see Adam and Barbara. And she is in sympathy with their assessment of her step-mother's horrible taste. Also horrible attitude.<br /><br />They don't quite know what to do, but when they returned to the house after the accident (actually, I think it was after the funeral), they found a book titled "Guidebook for the Recently Deceased." They tried to read it, but there was no index, and it didn't seem to make a lot of sense to them. They did manage to draw a door through to a bureaucratic nightmare where they were told to talk to their caseworker. Turns out their caseworker is an abrupt, shriveled old woman who smokes constantly and the smoke seeps out through a large slash in her neck. She warns them not to contact Beetlejuice, who used to be her assistant but "went out on his own." He had left an advertisement in their handbook, and for good measure, managed to put one on their TV.<br /><br />Still, when Lydia reads their handbook and does all she can to help them, they still haven't gotten rid of the Deetz family. In desperation, they call on Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton). You have to say his name three times to call him, which suggestions that he is a demon. Actually, I think the suggestion is also made that he's an alien. It's hard to be sure.<br /><br />The funniest parts of the movie are Beetlejuice's attempts to frighten the Deetz away: or at least the parents. He likes Lydia, and in fact wants her to marry him.<br /><br />There are lots and lots of inside-joke type references throughout, especially in the underworld bureaucracy. It's a very Tim Burton sort of film altogether.</p></body></html>

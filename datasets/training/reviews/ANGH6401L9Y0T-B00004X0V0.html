I think I may have mixed it up with the Blues Brothers, if that was the name: the one done by John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. Anyway, this is a very good movie. Just a little too silly on the science fiction part to qualify for five stars, but great fun.<br /><br />K (Tommy Lee Jones) works for "Division 6," he tells some border guards as he manages to select out one of a load of illegal aliens that really is an illegal alien. As in from outer space. But he tells different things to different people, and one of the border guards is certain that there is no Division 6.<br /><br />Due to his amazing performance, K recruits James Edwards of the NYPD (Will Smith), who then becomes J. The only other name you might recognize is Zed, played by Rip Torn. He was quite the heart throb when he was young, but that was a long, long time ago.<br /><br />Since their job is to keep track of all the aliens on the planet, most of whom are refugees and live peacefully disguised, there are lots of opportunities for great sight gags, like when J helps in the birth of a baby alien who really is cute. It's a pretty harrowing experience, but mother, baby and J all come through it OK.<br /><br />Central to the function of the MiB unit is a device like a penlight flashlight that wipes the memories of those involved in encounters. Keep your eye on that "light thingie," as it turns out to be pretty important all around.<br /><br />It's a very, very funny movie, but also real adventure.<br /><br />Also keep your eye on the cat.</p></body></html>

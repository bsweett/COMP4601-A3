<meta name="summary" content="Bourne again, but less than its predecessor"></head><body><p>After having reasonably enjoyed The Bourne Identity, I was looking forward to seeing how the Bourne Supremacy carries on with Jason Bourne's story.  Bourne and Marie are in hiding in India, still trying to recover lost memories of the past.  But Bourne soon becomes another CIA target, after being framed for a killing, and for his own self-preservation he needs to take an active role in uncovering the secrets of Treadstone and of his hunters in order to discover why he's being gunned down.  There's action sequences and car chases a plenty, and the graphic violence did force me to look away more than once, but then again I'm known for being squeamish.<br /><br />Overall I didn't find that this film lived up to its predecessor.  The plot wasn't as plausible, and at times the motives and actions of the various characters were somewhat confusing.  The hand-held camera work has been lauded as enhancing realism by evoking an improvisational and authentic feel, but I found the frantic and jerky movement and blurry vision excessive and hard to follow, to the point that it detracted from the flow of the narrative.  Here's a case where movie-makers have adopted a home video style and just gone a little too far overboard with the deliberate amateur feel.  But perhaps most significantly, Jason Bourne's character wasn't as sympathetic as it was in the Bourne Identity.  Even though there's a real sense of him being a victim of his circumstances and even his use of violence is mostly out of necessity rather than by personal choice, there's also a sense that he's more of a colder and more vengeful killing machine after tragically losing his lady, so it's harder to empathize with him.  It's still refreshing to see a film that doesn't go overboard with foul language and blasphemy (there were a few incidences of this, but it was minimal and even less than the first in the series), but as a follow-up this doesn't quite match the strength of the original.  - GODLY GADFLY</p></body></html>

The individual in question swallows a large number of carefully-wrapped pellets containing either cocaine or heroin in order to smuggle them into the United States undetected. If all goes well, the transaction is successful and payment is tendered in exchange for the mule's defecated cargo. If not, a worst-case scenario might involve a long prison term or death when one of the pellets ruptures inside the mule's stomach.<br /><br />If any other film has ever explored the duties of drug mules as its' primary subject matter, I haven't seen it. That's surprising, considering that these people are an essential part of the business and so many movies concerning the drug trade have been produced. This would have been a very easy subject to trivialize as a flashy actioner or a tiresome political exercise, but director Joshua Marston wrote and directed this film as a straightforward drama that spares no details.<br /><br />While the entire cast is impressive, Moreno's performance justifies the enormous praise that's been lavished upon it. It's very rare to see a newcomer perform a role with naturalistic conviction, especially when said performance is reinforced with such effortless charm. That Moreno possesses what must be the purest, most pastoral beauty that I've seen onscreen in years doesn't exactly detract from her screen presence.<br /><br />Marston accomplishes quite a lot with a small budget, almost giving this microproduction the polish of a major feature. Budget constraints are mostly relegated to a limited narrative that focuses entirely on the story from Maria's perspective. Perhaps 60% of the film consists of close-up shots of Moreno; since she's more than easy on the eyes and her delivery is flawless, this really isn't a problem. The tension and dramatic force of this tumultuous story is never dulled by unnecessary sentimental flourishes.<br /><br />The clever visual metaphor of the theatrical poster and video cover isn't depicted in the film, and that's just as well. Nevertheless, few other promotional materials have ever caught my eye as these have. See how much can be done with good photography, a pretty face and thoughtful post-Catholic sensibilities?</p></body></html>

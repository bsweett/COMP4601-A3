<meta name="summary" content="HIGH ON THE ACTION & AVERAGE ON STORY"></head><body><p>High octane action galore but the story is uneven and even unsatisfying in certain parts.  Flashbacks to the love story give the tale some texture but it's not enough.  Jolie isn't very believable to me as an action hero when she starts going hand-to-hand with people bigger than her (maybe if she did judo instead of direct attacks) which takes away from believability for me.  I would only recommend this if you like action scenes over story or you just like looking at Jolie's pretty face.  DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus to B minus; ACTION SCENES: B plus to A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: February 2011.</p></body></html>

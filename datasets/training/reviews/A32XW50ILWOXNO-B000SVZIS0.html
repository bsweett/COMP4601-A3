<meta name="summary" content="Burton plays it safe, Marky Mark plays it bland."></head><body><p>A lot of bluster arose before the unveiling of Tim Burton's "reimagined" version of "The Planet of the Apes," to which the eccentric Burton responded by making his straightest movie ever. The apocalyptic tone drained away, the 2001 film is a by-the-book action flick, done well, but no more, with a twisteroo ending that isn't worth explaining. Mark Wahlberg is a bland human hero, while Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth steal the film as a helpful, civic-minded ape and a warlord general. Burton delivered a bombproof studio hit with few if any risks attached, instead of employing his hit-and-miss spin; in this case, the latter would have been the smarter artistic play but a financial reach.</p></body></html>

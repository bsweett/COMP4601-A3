Beginning with Charles's early childhood and continuing up through his later years, the movie shows Charles as a complex man who was not only blessed with amazing talent but was driven to succeed and overcome all obstacles even as a boy, despite his blindness. The movie also doesn't shy away from the dark side of his character, showing his struggle with drugs and his philandering ways with women on the road.  But overall, it's a beautifully done portrayal of a great musician and composer who single-handedly transformed the pop musical scene during his lifetime. Definitely worth your time and money to see if you're a fan (and even if you're not).</p></body></html>

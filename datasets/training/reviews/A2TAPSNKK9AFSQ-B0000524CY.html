<meta name="summary" content="Yawn!!! Unlike Linda This Movie Did Not Make My Head Spin!!!"></head><body><p>This would have to be one of the most overrated and overhyped movies ever produced. It concerns a young girl named Reagan, played by Linda Blair who is possessed by the Devil. Linda talks pretty foul,masturbates and  vomits green stuff which is pretty typical of kids these days. Back then it was considered to be "shocking". One has to remember that this sorry excuse for a Horror movie was made back in 1973 in a much quainter Society than now.I give this movie 5 stars because I kind of like the atmosphere of the movie which is about all that it has going for it.</p></body></html>

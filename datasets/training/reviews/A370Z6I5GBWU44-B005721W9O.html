I especially liked Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman in their roles. This movie is a mix of 'fake' sci-fi, as Tim Allen and his cast are actually just actors in a Star Trek-esque show, but there are real aliens in here who view that show as historical documents and thus seek out the Galaxy Quest cast for aid. Overall good movie with a fun story, two thumbs up!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Intense"></head><body><p>Hard to beat the original for a fresh zombie take; This film starts out with one of the best opening sequences since the remake of Dawn of the Dead; And while the film rarely comes close to reaching the same level of intensity as those first few minutes, there are many different scenarios that arise that are close; Carlyle does what he can w/his limited character, as do most of the actors; The sense of character development from part 1 is lacking, but there are still plenty of harrowing zombie moments for those interested in the genre and looking for a solid horror effort. I just wished Danny Boyle had directed this...who know what would have happened then!!!</p></body></html>

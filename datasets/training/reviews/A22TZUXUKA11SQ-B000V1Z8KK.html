<meta name="summary" content=""I don't think you understand. These boys killed my dog.""></head><body><p>I understand. Because I love dogs too.<br /><br />Shooter was exactly what I expected, an exciting, action packed story about an expert marksman who is framed for a political assassination. Along the way to proving his innocence, Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swaggert has to enlist the help of an FBI agent, the ex-wife of his former spotter, and a crooked US Senator.<br /><br />I didn't expect much from this film, and I wasn't disappointed. I'm also pleased to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how engaging and entertaining this movie was. I'm all for vengeance in the name of man's best friend. Really. They shouldn't have killed his dog.</p></body></html>

I wasn't sure what to expect really, it didn't get too many good reviews, but then again, it's Bruce Willis so it has to be good right?  The premise is pretty entertaining in itself, enough so that you know the movie will hold a few nail-biting scenes, and it does especially towards the end as everything starts winding down.  So heres the story.  You have Jeff (Willis) who's an x-hostage negotiator (the opening sequence shows us why he's an X) who is now working as cheif of police in a small CA town.  His wife and daughter visit on weekends and you can see his marriage is on rocky grounds...it almost appears that everyone can see that but him.  Enter our unlucky family, the ones held hostage by a group of teenage boys who wanted their car, but in the process someone gets shot and another gets knocked out and pretty soon the young boys get thrown into panic mode as the take the two children of the house hostage and close themselves into the house using the servalence system.  The only problem (at least for Willis) is that these boys took the wrong mad hostage.  he's an acountant (innocent enough) and he has connections with organized crime (not so innocent) and these crime lords need a disk that this man has encrypted for them.  The catch here is if Jeff doesn't hold the cops off and keep everyone inside the house until these crime lords get into the house to get there disk then Jeff's family will die.  He's got some choices to make.  If he goes inside the house to save the family, his own may die, and if he stays outside the house to protect his own family then the innocent children in the house may die.  It's a catch 22.  Scene stealer Ben Foster does an outstanding job portraying a pshycopath.  He just LOOKED insane, and the whole 'burn it' scene (When you watch you'll know what I mean) is just crazy...the most intence part of the film...All in all it was an impressive film.  Willis held his own, delivering a solid knock out punch of a performance.  I wish he would get more notice for his roles...but alas, I don't know if he ever will...We love you Bruce, keep up the GREAT work!</p></body></html>

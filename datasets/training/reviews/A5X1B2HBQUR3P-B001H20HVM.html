<meta name="summary" content="Awesome gore'n'guts - the best of the series from 1 to 3"></head><body><p>The saw trilogy is a continuos story. When they wrote saw, I am sure they did not have trilogy in mind. Infact saw was not even intended for mainstream theatre release when it was in it's initial project stage. The success of saw :-) saw to it that 2 and 3 came out. The success is due to the originality of the story, the plotting, the ingenious wretched instruments of torture/death and the gore. I  have not seen gore of such a raw nature in any other movie. It is clinical and methodical gore'n'guts. saw 2 is the best of the 3 (I haven't seen 4 yet).<br /><br />Traps include: death mask aka venus head trap; needle pit;wrist slasher;body oven, peep hole eye pistol.<br /><br />Extras on dvd is pretty cool. There is the "the traps of Jigsaw" which shows every trap from story board, production design and sfx level. And there is also a director's audio commentary.<br /><br />There is a "making of". You'll be better off renting this one. I don't think you want to be watching this one every week else you'll end up with insomnia.<br /><br />This one is more psychological and the torture traps/rigs are awesome. The SFX team a cool job. Just watch the movie for what it is. If you are squeamish about blood and gore, you won't be renting this one out anyway. The Critics on many sites have panned the whole saw series. I think it's unfair to judge the movie as bad from the angle that there is too much gore. you have to first be a fan of the genre and then judge it within the genre of blood'n'guts films. Thing is saw is so cutting edge, new age and barrier breaking that I dont think there's been a movie like saw. The images are pretty gruesome and not for the faint heartened. saw2 has a cool ending. I won't say more than that. This movie brings together a group of ppl caught in a house. 2 leads the movie into 3. Its almost 2 episodes. 3 can't be seen without seeing 2 first else you will get totally confused. Same with 2. If you haven't seen 1 don't see this one. The set from saw 1 is back: the famous toilet set with the infamous ankle piece has been left over (cut in saw1 to escape from the leg chain) features here. "Ohh yes there will be blood" he said. And you know what, he delivers on his promise.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better Than Citzen Kane"></head><body><p>Now considered the greatest American Film, yes, greater than Citizen Kane, The Searchers was always a John Wayne-John Ford favorite, but lately the critics have chimed in. Ford records once again and for all time his actors in the backdrop of an unreal place, Monument Valley. The jutting rocks placed before the camera as if an Ansel Adams photograph excites the eye.  There's much to be said for a good shoot site.  This one is the best of all time.  The framed shots from within The Edwards cabin, a photo of Wayne coming and going as the lonely American without connection to his family, a beautiful allegory in cinema.<br /><br />Made in 1955 from a book by Alan Le May, essentially this is a story of tribal hatred.  The white settlers and the Comanche battle it out for the land and the women. The racial insanity, still potent in the mid-50's after two hundred years of murderous strife has hit the wall.  Ethan as played by Wayne, the stereotypical Ford, Western hero, except for one flaw: Ethan is a racist.  The Indian raid on his family, the rape of his niece and the kidnapping of Debbie Edwards, played by Natalie Wood as an adult (her younger sister played the child) send Ethan on a trek of revenge. Young Martin Pawley played by Jeffrey Hunter searches for Debbie also, but only to keep his adopted uncle from murdering her.  Ethan wants do an honor killing because the Comanche Chief, Sky will have bedded her by the time she's a woman.  The search goes on episodically all over the Southwest for five years and Debbie is indeed a woman in Sky's tepee.<br /><br />The reuniting of lovers and the return of Debbie to a tranquil America of love and tolerance envelopes all but one in the curious ending.  Only Ethan is alone in the doorway with the rock sculptures of Monument Valley.<br /><br />One last note: I know cosmetics were important to 1950's sensibilities.  The false eyelashes and ruby red lips of Natalie Wood playing a white- woman turned Comanche and her tight fitting Indian dress, distracted from an otherwise well researched make-up and costuming.</p></body></html>

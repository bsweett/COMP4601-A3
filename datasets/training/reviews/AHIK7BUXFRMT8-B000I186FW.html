The movie immediately struck me as intriguing and original; I felt myself being drawn in to the mystery and the danger and became very curious how things were going to progress. The movie was doing a great job of involving me in the story and creating the beginnings of a sympathetic concern for the characters.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving does an impressive job as the enigmatic V and Natalie Portman has an opportunity to display her acting skills in a very convincing manner as the young Evey. The scenery and overall ambience of the movie are effective in conveying the oppressive nature of life under the dictatorial control of Chancellor Adam Sutler, played by John Hurt.<br /><br />This is a dark, serious, action movie which I believe more sensitive children and adults should probably avoid. It is very effective in conveying a memorable impression of tragedy, darkness and violence which some may find hard to handle.</p></body></html>

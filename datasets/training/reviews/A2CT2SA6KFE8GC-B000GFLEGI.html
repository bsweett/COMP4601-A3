To Romero fans, this is a pretty big deal, to everyone else, it's just another zombie movie that's come out.  To horror fans  this film has been anticipated like The Phantom Menace was to sci-fi fans.  Did it meet expectations?  No.  Twenty years of built up excitement for this film are the cause.  With that kind of anticipation, this could be probably the best film ever made and it still wouldn't live up to expectations.  So, no, it doesn't.  But is it a good movie?  Hell yes it is!  Romero's back to the genre he created to show all the Zack Snyders and Paul Andersons of the world how it's really done.  And it's a very welcome return after all the crapfests posing as zombie films that we've had to deal with in recent years.  These are the Romero zombies, not the running, jumping, hopping, skipping, galloping zombies we've been seeing recently(it's a large stretch of the imagination to accept the concept of a dead person coming back to life to eat you.  It's downright inane to accept a dead person coming back and acting like an olympic gymnast).  The subject is handled with intelligence, but at the same time never taking itself 100% seriously.  Day Of The Dead was quite grim, Land is a little more like Dawn.  In fact, the whole look and feel of this film reminded me alot of Tom Savini's Night remake.  Romero's working with a bigger budget here-for him anyway.  Not a Summer Blockbuster budget, but larger than anything he's worked with before, and he makes the most of it.  It's not a special fx extravaganza.  Romero uses fx when necessary, relying on good ol' storytelling to progress the film(imagine that!).  Even Leguizamo's good!  I was skeptical when I found out he was in the film.  Not that I don't like him, he just didn't seem to fit.  But Leguizamo has proven he can put on a serious performance when he wants to, and he does here.  I wasn't crazy about a few of the humor attempts.  Humor's played a role in all the Dead films, but I could have done without the Samoan character who has no purpose in the film but to say goofy lines.  Why are Samoans always the butt of jokes in movies?  Romero doesn't go overboard with CGI(thank god!), but there are a few cgi headshots that would have looked alot better had Savini done them.  In the past, Romero had been able to tell the execs where to shove their R rating, but the film business has changed ALOT in recent years.  George had to settle for that R rating coz mommy and daddy at the MPAA are looking out for us.  Don't worry, coz George promises the uncut proper version on dvd.  The violence here pushes the R rating almost to it's breaking point though.  All in all, I enjoyed Land Of The Dead and I'm very glad that George finally was able to make it.  If there's anything good to be said about crap like Resident Evil and House Of The Dead, it's that they probably helped open the doors for George to make this film.  It's not gonna please everybody.  The harshest critics of this film will be Romero's fans, all of whom have 20 years of built up expectations like myself.  The fact of the matter is, you're just not gonna please them all.  It's a helluva lot better than the Phantom Menace too.  I say support the master and go check it out in the theater before someone remakes it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Seen It All Before"></head><body><p>Before I get into my review, let me say that &quot;The Core&quot; is an exciting movie that will probably have you on the edge of you seat wondering what will happen next. However, this type of &quot;the end of the world is coming so let's get a crew of scientists together to save the world&quot; film has been done many, many, many times before.<p>The story is mainly about how the earth is losing it's electromagnetic field due to the fact that the outer layer of the earth's core has stopped moving around the inner core (there is a lot of scientific jargon in the film that explains all of this). So a group of scientists go to the earth's core and try to jumpstart the outer core into moving again. Because of the wearing away of the electromagnetic field, the earth is prone to the radioactive particles, gases, etc. from space that will ultimately turn the earth into one big fireball.<p>There are many scenes of destruction and the obligatory widdling away of the crew due to various methods of death. Then there is the climactic scene where the surviving members achieve success and head home.<p>I'm not saying that &quot;The Core&quot; is a bad film, but it's something that we've all seen before and I can't say that it's that interesting that it's a must-see. Make the decision yourself. You could really love it or you could not think too much of it.</p></body></html>

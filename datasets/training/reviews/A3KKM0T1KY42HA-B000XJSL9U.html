Rickman and Jeremy Irons, in my opinion, could easily be confused with each other...especially when they're heavily costumed.<br /><br />Die Hard 2 was based on the book titled 58 Minutes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812510038">58 Minutes</a> by Walter Wager. The plane crash at the beginning of the movie is consisdered one of the most horrific ever filmed (according to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000T8XYOW">Maxim</a>).<br /><br />Die Hard 3 has John McTiernan back in the director's seat, and DH3 is the only one of the four to have been written by a screenwriter. It stars Alan-Rickman-act-alike Jeremy Irons as 'the bad guy'.<br /><br />Die Hard 4 is based on a May 1997 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N7TL">Wired</a> article by John Carlin. DH4 is directed by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGJ80I">Underworld</a> series master Len Wiseman and stars that dude (Justin Long) who's more popular from his stint in the recent Apple Computer commercials than his past acting roles.<br /><br />The Blu Ray compilation of all four films is a great package. Chances are that you're here (like I was) because you've already seen the first three, and you're wondering if it's worth it to buy the entire collection in order to get the 4th? I'll say this: the fourth (Live Free or Die Hard) stands out as one of the best, if not the best, of the series. So if you've always wanted the Die Hard series in your collection, go with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W4HIY0">Die Hard Collection</a>.<br /><br />Like the previous 3 movies, in Live Free or Die Hard John McClane (Bruce Willis) is seemingly indestructable, surviving death defying feat after death defying feat. Willis' banter with costar Long is witty and funnier than anything from the first three movies combined. The action is non-stop, and the supporting cast is fabulous (especially <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O5B4BU">Deadwood's</a> Timothy Olyphant).<br /><br />Add the collection to your cart or Die Hard.</p></body></html>

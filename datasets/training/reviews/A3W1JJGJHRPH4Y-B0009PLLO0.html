<meta name="summary" content="Boring"></head><body><p>The movie was boring. Farrel was miscast. I just didn't believe anyone would follow him to the ends of the earth, let alone a whole army. He was a good actor, but he seemed out of place in the ancient world. Jolie had a strange accent and even a stranger role. The movie just sort of stopped when she was on.<br /><br />The battle scenes which were usually Stone's forte, were boring. The movie flipped back and forth several times in flashbacks. This did not help the already diffused narrative thread. Alexander's sexuality was addressed. I guess it was supposed to be better in the director's cut, but it was still not very well done. A pouting boyfriend hanging around in the background with no substantial role was not interesting. Alexander's wife had very little to do too.<br /><br />The good parts are the exotic scenery and the supporting caste, except for Jolie. Plummer, Kilmer, and Hopkins were good. I just had a hard time sitting through it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great teen movie"></head><body><p>I was totally not expecting to like this movie, the cover wasn't that creative, just two rather unattractive chicks. One of whom people seem to go ga-ga for, and she looks much better without the 20lbs she had to gain for this! I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself laughing along with Seymour (played brilliantly by Steve Buscemi) and identifying (slightly) with Thora Birch's character, Enid. She's the kinda person you could be friends with; she's so fantastic with the dry humour! However, I'll always know Thora Birch as Teeny in Now &amp; Then, and she's still the same, just a little more grown up, but she still does the same facial expressions. At least she doesn't have to put Jell-O filled balloons in her bra anymore! <p>Steve Buscemi did his character, the overly eccentric and dorky Seymour, who Enid almost seems to grow an obsession with, which results in something which is quite embarrassing and cringe-worthy, especially the aftermath. You really do feel sorry for him, especially since he seems to be after Enid more than usual afterwards.<p>You get a whole background to Enid's character - her wimpy father, her dress sense, her bedroom, her taste in music/films. But what was really disappointing was the lack of background information about Rebecca's (Scarlett Johansson) character. She was basically a tag-along, and did all the following of the leader, Enid. Her character could have lots of development to it, but she was pushed aside to overly-extend Enid's character and home-life. Scarlett has definitely changed since Ghost World - she's gone platinum blonde since 'appearing' in films like Girl With A Pearl Earring and Lost In Translation. Rebecca seems to come and go in the film, she doesn't appear that much, and disappears for a lot of the film, along popping up now and then.<p>I really saw similarities between this and Romy &amp; Michele's High School Reunion. And any other high school movies along these lines. <p>At the start, I did not like Enid. She basically bossed Rebecca about, told her what to do and when and then she started on Seymour! Towards the end, I really began to feel for her, and felt a bit sad. This film said it was like no other &quot;teen comedy&quot; which seemed to imply it was a teen 'comedy'. Am I missing something, cos most of the film made me feel really sad, when it came to Enid &amp; Rebecca falling out, or the awkwardness with Enid &amp; Seymour. Sure, Seymour was funny, but with me identifying with Enid, I think you'll find this film a bit sad. If you identify with Rebecca, then you'll find it even sadder! <p>I'm so happy to have seen this movie, and it's a great addition to my collection, don't you think?! I'm still a bit freaked that I identified with Enid that much! But this is definitely a movie to get, although the whole Ghost World title doesn't have a lot to do with the movie (although a very cool and original title) - just don't think you're actually seeing a film about ghosts.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A great WWII film"></head><body><p>Letters from Iwo Jima is well scripted and acted. Ken Watanabe and Kazunari Ninomiya were fantastic.<br /><br />While perhaps not popular with people of the WWII generation, the strength of thi film is that it shows the battle for the island from the Japanese point of view. The film humanizes the Japanese without engaging in revisionism or political correctness. In it we see the "enemy" as men with wives, children, many of whom would rather not be fighting, but who love their country and cherish their "honor." Letters doesn't attempt to justify the Japanese position during the war.  Rather, it reminds us that, on an individual level, the Japanese were probably not much different than their American enemies (at least in terms of their hopes, dreams, aspirations, etc.)<br /><br />The cast seemed sparse, giving it something of a low budget feel.  It was filmed through very dark lenses, or so it would appear. It's a color film that has so little color that it looks as if it were shot in B&W. Contrast that with Flags of Our Fathers, which was very colorful and bright.<br /><br />There are several shots of American airplanes and what appears to be the entire Pacific fleet approaching the island. The panoramic shots of the approaching US fire power, is almost breathtaking, certainly awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Comparisons to its brother film, Flags of our Fathers, are unavoidable.  In virtually all categories or measures, Letters is the better of the two films.  If you liked Flags, you'll really like Letters.</p></body></html>

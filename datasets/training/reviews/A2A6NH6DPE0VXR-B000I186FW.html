<meta name="summary" content="A very good movie with a little something for everyone"></head><body><p>The directors of the Matrix films bring us V for Vendetta "although they just wrote the screenplay and don't direct it". The great Hugo Weaving who played Agent Smith in those films stars here and is excellent considering he wears a mask the whole time. He brings charm and class to the role while also makes you feel bad for anyone who has to cross him. He plays a hero/terrorist trying to find justice in a world controlled by an evil dictator.<br /><br />  He isn't your ordinary hero, he doesn't mind killing people what so ever. He goes around killing the people who's fault it is that he got burnt badly and then leaves a rose on their corpse. He gets help from a women played by Natalie Portman who deep down also hates how the world is. Since her parents were taken from her and executed when she was little. Together they try to stop the evil dictator played by John Hurt, as a cop played by Stephen Rea (The Crying Game) trys to track them down and stop V. The movie is dark and very very violent but it also has heart  and a compelling story with romance on the side. It has Natalie Portman giving a better performance than she did in all 3 StarWars prequels. Well although the role is sorta similar to her role in the Professional. Where she falls for her mentore but can never actually be with him.</p></body></html>

And our knowledge of him as a man and as a creative genius is complete with this movie.<br /><br />Sort of like with "Fog of War," it's amazing that Ray Charles approved the script and, derivately, the way it all ends up on screen.  Some screen biographies are fawning and obviously false;  this one is unsparing.  A womanizer and drug addict;  a man who could use people ruthlessly and place himself at the center of his own universe.<br /><br />All for the music.  Like his screen wife says, that's all that mattered to him, it seems.  But he expresses for all of us joy, love, sex, misery, longing, lonliness and just plain fun.<br /><br />It was so sad when he died.  But with this DVD, "Hey, everybody, Ray Charles is in town," so let the good times roll.<br /><br />PS - for that tune, buy the CD called "Q's Jook Joint."  Ray does it up with a big band and sounds like a young man...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Pianist - An extremely poignant true story!"></head><body><p>This extraordinary film serves skillfully as a poetic reminder of humanities startling capacity for insufferable cruelty towards one another and amazing capacity for kindness to one another in particularly difficult situations!  Although there are several scenes throughout this film that are dreadfully difficult to watch it is a film that should be watched and the reminders it displays continued to be learned in the sincere hopes that nothing like this ever happens again in the future of humanity.<p>It is of little wonder that this film that is based on a true story won three Academy awards; Best Actor for Adrien Brody, Best Director for Roman Polanski and Best (Adapted) Screenplay for Ronald Harwood.  Adrien Brody's unforgettable performance is nothing short of stunning as he plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist caught up in the Nazi's war against the Jewish in Poland during World War II.  This extraordinary film wouldn't have been as nearly successful without the exceptional performance given by all the supporting actors in this film as well who all deserve as much praise as possible for their parts.<p>Strangely enough, this is the first film I've watched that was directed by Roman Polanski, which is a mistake that will be corrected.  From the beginning to the end this film is a highly gripping one and I'm sure the credit for that goes just as much to Roman Polanski's direction as it does the script and the actors performances.<p>The Premise:<p>"The Pianist" is the true story Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish man of Jewish faith who, with his family and millions of others, was swept up in the Nazi occupation of Poland and their quest to exterminate the Jewish people.  Szpilman, being an exceptional pianist finds himself spared from the horrible train ride to a death camp but must bare the memory of watching his entire family take that ride as he continues to do what he must to survive to make it to the end of the war...<p>It is exceedingly difficult not to find yourself shedding a tear for the events that go on throughout this true tale of survival during the holocaust, which brings that much more poignancy to the film and its story.  I highly recommend this film to any and all!  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-A Story of Survival:  Insight into the making of the film and its authenticity<br />-Roman Polanski's own story of survival during WWII<br />-Behind the scenes interviews with Oscar winners Roman Polanski, Adrien Brody and Ronald Harwood<br />-Clips of Wladyslaw Szpilman playing the piano</p></body></html>

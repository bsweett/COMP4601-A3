The films starts off with a bang and has us wanting this unlikely anti-hero to succeed in his destructive mission. The acting is good, but I didn't feel the script allowed us to really get into these character's heads as much as I would have liked.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />The film has a rather silly and contrived ending that feels like a cop out or maybe it's just a case of laziness. Here is the ending I would have liked.<br /><br />When Foxx's character finds the bomb at City Hall, he goes back to Butler's cell to find that he is gone. The bomb they found is a decoy and there is a note in Butler's cell for Foxx stating "He Blew It!". Then immediately after reading this note, City Hall is blown sky high with all the officials going with it. The next scene could go two ways, either by having Butler's character escape and letting the justice system know he will be watching..... or having Foxx visiting Butler in an insane asylum with Butler waking from his morbid dream of revenge as he couldn't cope with the loss of his family. He had been there for the past ten years ever since the system let his family's murderers off! Foxx feels guilty and has been spending those ten years and the rest of his legal career righting the wrong he had done to Butler's character. Either ending is surely better than the silly ending used in the film.<br /><br />*****End Of Spoiler*****<br /><br />I'm no screen writer, but why not give the people what they want in a film like this. The anti-hero is set up to be the character we sympathize with and they should have let us have the total package. It's about time we had a non-traditional happy ending in one of these types of films! Regardless, this is a fun guilty pleasure film that will surely give Death Wish fans a treat, but it falls short in the end.</p></body></html>

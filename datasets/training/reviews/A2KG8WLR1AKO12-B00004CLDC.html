How does one even begin to praise this masterpiece that simply has no weaknesses?  The casting and script writing of &quot;Good Fellas&quot; are near perfect, and the story based on the true life experiences of Henry Hill provides us with a brutal and unsentimental view of a social milieu that is both treacherous and violent.  These are not men of honor, but ruthless back stabbers who don't hesitate to betray close friends for a few pieces of silver.  Ray Liotta splendidly portrays Hill as a man who joins the mob as a teenager for the excitement and fast money.  Those like Jimmy Conway (Robert Di Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) befriend Hill in their own dubious manner.  Hill looks upon them as brothers, but it seems they merely perceive him as a fellow party animal who aptly carries out his responsibilities to the group.  Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill is a woman who marries her man knowing full well about his dangerous side.  Hill introduces his wife to drugs and often places her in harm's way.  Their marriage is a never ending dysfunctional disaster.  It totally redefines the meaning of family values.<p>This is not a film for someone seeking a romanticized depiction of organized crime. These people are monsters who prey on their fellow citizens.  Scorsese refuses to pretend that they have many redeeming qualities.  Their virtues are few and far between,  and one only regrets that it takes so long for the authorities to put them behind bars.  Hill's later entry into a federal witness protection program is hard to swallow.  &quot;Good Fellas&quot; is hard hitting and honest.  I easily place it among the top one hundred movies of all time.</p></body></html>

The strain of having a secret identity is seriously affecting the social life and responsibilities of mild-mannered Peter Packer (Maguire) and forces him to abandon his role as the wall-crawling crime-fighter Spider-Man. When the menacing Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) threatens lovely Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and the rest of New York, Peter will have to face his greatest challenge yet. "Spider-Man 2" is a spectacular and emotionally powerful comic book adventure that succeeds over the original 2002 smash hit. The critically acclaimed summer film contains a compelling plot and appealing characters with strong emotional depth. "Spider-Man 2" also features some breathtaking action sequences, amazing special effects and delightful humor. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Alfred Molina deliver some moving performances. The fine cast also includes James Franco, Rosemary Harris, J. K. Simmons and Bruce Campbell in a brief funny appearance.<br /><br />If you were amazed by "Spider-Man 2" in theaters then "Spider-Man 2" Special Edition will indeed surprise you. The comic book blockbuster is presented in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD has a fine picture quality with great contrast and nice bright colors. Its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is very impressive with splendid surround effects. The 2-Disc special edition contains over 10 hours of supplemental features like two detailed audio commentaries by director Sam Raimi, cast member Tobey Maguire and technical crew, an extended "The Making of Spider-Man 2" documentary, various behind-the-scenes featurettes, "Ordinary" music video, theatrical trailers and DVD-Rom extras. Overall, "Spider-Man 2" has a grand DVD presentation and scores a solid "A".</p></body></html>

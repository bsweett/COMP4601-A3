<meta name="summary" content="Sporadic laughs.  I had hoped for more."></head><body><p>Adam, Nick & Lou have been "sort of" friends since high school, in the early 80s.  Now, decades later, they are distant from each other and have grown into essentially unhappy, poorly adjusted people.  When Lou nearly dies in an accident, the three friends, plus Adam's nephew Jacob head to a ski lodge that was the site of many debauched weekend ski trips for the three older men. (Apparently, reliving past glory is someone's idea of a "pick me up" getaway)  Much like the men themselves, the lodge is a hollow shell of its former self, run down and unappealing.<br /><br />But due to some sketchy science involving an illegally imported energy drink spilling on a control panel, their hot tub turns into a time machine that sends them all back to the 80s.  And naturally, they have a chance to relive moments they've always wanted a second chance with.  Can they turn their lives around?  Will they mess up the space/time continuum?  Will raunchy, R-rated behavior ensue?<br /><br />Well, considering the movie is named HOT TUB TIME MACHINE...I hope you can figure out the answers to those questions.  You pretty much know exactly what to expect from this film going into it.  The movie wants to be this year's THE HANGOVER.  But while it has many genuine laughs, it falls short of that lofty goal.<br /><br />John Cusack stars as Adam, a sad sack who has just left another relationship.  He's just sort of slouching through life, and in many ways, even when he returns to his former self, he can't seem to shake the malaise very readily.  He's more or less the party-pooper of the group.  It's fun to see Cusack in an 80's comedy, since he starred in so many great ones (BETTER OFF DEAD being a personal favorite).  I wish the actor Cusack had enjoyed himself a little bit more...he plays too much of the movie straight.  That's a shame, because his co-stars stretch the limits of credibility in their over-the-top performances.<br /><br />Craig Robinson (from THE OFFICE) is Nick.  He's the married friend who has to struggle mightily with temptation from all the young girls throwing themselves at him.  He's a former musician who recaptures his glory days by performing "Let's Get It Started In Here" by the Black-eyed Peas for his rapturous audience.  (Funny scene!)  Robinson is the kind of comic actor who gets by on a low key attitude most of the time...but this role actually has him stretch his usual persona just a little, and he does fine.  I wouldn't call it a game changer for Robinson, but it won't hurt his career.<br /><br />Rob Cordry is the perhaps suicidal Lou.  He's crazy and unconcerned for his physical safety, so when he's presented with a chance to relive his crazy youth, he embraces that with insane fervor.  Cordry is a master of being hugely offensive, particularly towards women (he stole his scenes in the forgettable WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS), and a co-starring role stretches the audience's ability to like him.  He chews into his part with gusto, though.  I'd like to see him in a more sympathetic leading role...there might actually be something there.<br /><br />There are a few odd cameos, most memorably from Crispin Glover (an always welcome oddball).  Chevy Chase makes a nearly pointless appearance in a couple of scenes.  And Lizzy Caplan (CLOVERFIELD, MEAN GIRLS, TRUE BLOOD) shows up as someone's love interest.  Her part is underwritten, but she's good enough to pull it off.<br /><br />The movie is just wildly uneven and choppy.  It has the 80's visual aesthetic of PORKY'S and tries to have the pacing and attitude of a Judd Apatow film...but in the end it isn't quite slapstick and raunchy enough to make us laugh all the way through, nor are the "tender" parts invested with any real feeling.  There are many funny bits, and I certainly enjoyed myself...but the premise (and great title) led me to hope for something more transcendently silly.  No such luck.<br /><br />Probably good for a rental, particularly if you've got a few folks (adults) over for a few beers.  But it's a near miss for me.</p></body></html>

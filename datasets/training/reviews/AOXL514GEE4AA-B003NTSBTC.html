Based on a novel, the story takes place in 1954. DiCaprio plays U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels, and he does so convincingly. Teddy is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Hospital for the criminally insane. As he starts to dig deeper and deeper into the case, he begins to wonder if somehow he is part of a much larger and twisted plot. Teddy quickly realizes that he must solve this case and get off the island before he loses his own "sanity".<br /><br />This movie really deserves 4.5 stars. Scorcese is such a master of building a "real" world in his fims. You feel like it's 1954 from wardrobe to attitude. The acting in this film is wonderful! DiCaprio's range is incredible, which makes him a great actor. We will be watching Leo for decades to come. I will not spoil the movie in my review (I never do), but like the box says "it deserves multiple viewings". That is because once the mystery is revealed, you will want to watch the movie from a different perspective. An excellent film!<br /><br />BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Paramount really does a nice job here. The colors are toned down to reflect not only the time, but the mood of the island and hospital. The pictures still remains crisp and every detail is captured to immerse you into the environment. The audio mix is good. SPECIAL FEATURES: Not much here, but the 2 featurettes included are great! After watching the movie, spend the extra 20 minutes to watch them. FINAL THOUGHTS: A MUST OWN!</p></body></html>

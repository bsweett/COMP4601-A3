<meta name="summary" content="WATCH THIS SHOT"></head><body><p>SHOOTER (DVD).<br /><br />Shooter is based upon the novel Point of Impact by Stephen Hunter.  I enjoyed the novel some years ago; I enjoyed the movie last night.<br /><br />Gunnery sergeant Bob Lee Swagger( Mark Wahlberrg) is a sniper.  He's been recruited by Spooks to a special mission that only he is good enough to do.  He gathers up his trusty .50 caliber Barrett sniper rifle and takes a couple of practice shots, then agrees to do the mission.  Of course since Spooks are involved he is set up for something that he didn't do, Spooks are notorious for weaving a web of deception and double crossing.<br /><br />The  movie follows Swagger across the country making one outrageous shot after another.  In the end Swagger pulls off a twist, gets the girl and saves the day.  All in all a very satisfying movie.<br /><br />Gunner  July, 2007</p></body></html>

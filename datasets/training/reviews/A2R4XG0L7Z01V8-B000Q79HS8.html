So many have fallen by the wayside, and sequels don't hold much credibility these days, with CGI and gimmicky concepts, especially when Hollywood is churning them when they're not even necessary.<br /><br />But Bourne Identity needed a sequel, to carry on the story of Jason Bourne, to see if he recovers anymore of his memory. Two years after the first finished, Jason & Marie are in India, living off the grid, enjoying life and each other. Until something tragic happens, and Jason is once more on the run, running from himself, and discovering on the way, that he's been framed for two murders. He's still having recurring nightmares, and is still trying to piece together his former life.<br /><br />The action scenes are absolutely stunning, an amazing follow up to Identity, with an even better car chase than the original, in a taxi, which soon gets wrecked. Bourne even surpasses himself, when in Identity, he fought an enemy with a pen, he now fights an enemy with a rolled up newspaper!<br /><br />I'm still disappointed at Julia Stiles' screen time in this, a gripe which has carried on from Identity. While she has marginally more screen time than the first, it's still not enough for a great actress as she is, trying to spreak her wings past her teenage film roles. Brian Cox has a little bit more revealed about his character, and all is not what it seems with him!<br /><br />Supremacy is an excellent follow up to an already excellent original movie, and I look forward to seeing exactly what happens to Bourne in Ultimatium. I hope everything is resolved nicely. It's quite strange, because the end of Ultimatium is actually shown at the end of Supremacy, a strange tactic, but something that leaves the viewers wanting more.</p></body></html>

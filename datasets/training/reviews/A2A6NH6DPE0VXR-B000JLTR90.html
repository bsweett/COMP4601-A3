It's well acted even if everyone just talks as if they're reading the script that exact same moment. I like M. Night Shyamalan's movies but he has actors act so emotionless in his movies where they basically just talk like robots through most the movie.  It's like he's after getting wooden performances from his actors. I'm surprised he hasn't worked with Keanu Reeves yet.  His only movie that wasn't like that was probably the Sixth Sense. I also loved the under-rated and unappreciated Unbreakable and Signs as well. I never minded the slow paces of his films because they always led to something good. Here we just get a lot of talented actors talking and trying to help the  Lady in the Water (Bryce Dallas Howard) but without them or us even knowing why they wanna help her. The talented  Paul Giamatti just trys to figure out how a story book goes and what it has to do with her. It's like he just found her in his pool yet he knows she has something to do with that book. Well that's how it seemed to me anyway, like everyone just decides to help her the second they meet her.<br /><br />  Giamatti is good in every role he's in and is good here too but his performance is the best thing about the movie. It's him that really has your attention the whole time in the movie. Everyone else isn't bad but they aren't as captivating as Giamatti. I guess Dallas Howard is a little too but all she really gets to do is make a blank stare with a scared look on her face through the whole thing. M. Night Shyamalan has to make an acting appearance in the film as well of course but he needs to give that a break already even if he is a decent actor. I mean Alfred Hitchcock just made small appearances in his movies, he didn't cast himself in supporting roles.<br /><br />  Plus his movie critic character seems to be actually talking about M. Night Shyamalan movies. I mean he knocks a movie that has nothing but people just speaking their minds unrealistically through-out the movie. That sounds a lot like this movie..... I have to admit that when his films come to life at the end they always manage to get me teared up but I think that's just the power of James Newtown Howard's musical score abilities. The scene that his score gets pumped up is when it's reveiled who the guardian of the Lady in the Water is and that scene's what got my tears going lol. It's the most lively and well done scene in the movie even if it is a little silly. But it probably wouldn't of had that effect on me if it wasn't for the musical score.  M. Night Shyamalan should just make those Unbreakable sequels that he had planned. I mean he didn't make them due to bad reviews but the Village and Lady in the Water probably got worse reviews. So he might as well make Unbreakable sequels because at least that was very well liked by some people like myself.</p></body></html>

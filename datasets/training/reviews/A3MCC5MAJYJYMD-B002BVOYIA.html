The genocide occured in 1994 and it is now finally being revealed to the majority of the American public.  Nothing really stood out in the film that made me remember it too much.  Watch a PBS documentary about the event if it comes on television one of these days.  It will most likely be more informative and enlightening than this movie.  Making a movie about a tragic event does not make it automatically worthwhile or rewarding.</p></body></html>

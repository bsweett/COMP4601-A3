<meta name="summary" content="Death and afterlife"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood is certainly one of the most iconic people on this planet. As a actor he has has had some memorable roles and lines, as an director he is in a class by himself. Most of his films that he has directed have repeat viewing value and some have become classics. At an age where most people could barely walk, to have such a prolific directorial flourish is simply amazing. His latest work ` Hereafter' is abut death, tragedy, the effect it has some people and their attempts to cope with it, thus continuing his obsession with death. Three divergent story lines across three different continents are merged together in a ending.<br />Marie ( Cecile De France) survives a tsunami but finds that he life is falling around her. She is unable to cope with her relationships, her work and life when she returns home after this tragedy. George Lonegan ( Matt Damon) is a psychic who forsakes fame and riches he could have had as a psychic when he realizes that his gift is more like a curse and prefers to lives in near obscurity. Finally there are Marcus and Jason who are struggling with their mother's alcoholism and are struck with a life altering event.<br />The segment of Marcus and Jason was the most touching, and warms your heart to feel this brotherly love. The other segments are fine and well acted. The Tsunami scene is the great and probably the most fast paced in the entire movie. A common grouse amongst the viewers of this movie is the slow pacing but I felt that was necessary and keeping up with the theme of the movie. The tone of the photography is extremely muted and brightens up only towards the end. The actors are great and Matt Damon slips effortlessly in to his role as a psychic, the kids Marcus and Jason are incredible as well. This may not be Eastwood's most accomplished work but also not his weakest either. Four stars.</p></body></html>

The Chronicles of Riddick however, find Diesel and writer/director David Twohy in the center of a glorified B-movie with A plus special effects, and the character development of Diesel's Riddick, which really attempted to go somewhere in Pitch Black, gets thrown out the window here.  Riddick finds himself with a massive bounty on his head, and he is also thrown into a full scale war with a fascist master race bent on, what else, domination of the universe.  Colm Feore provides an antagonistical villain, while Lord of the Rings' Karl Urban is given a meaty role, and Thandie Newton and Judi Dench are wasted in their roles.  The CGI effects are spectacular, but Diesel proves to be the biggest special effect of them all; flexing his way towards a forseeable conclusion that leaves the door open for another "Chronicle".  This is the franchise that Diesel chose over his profitable XXX film, and even though I don't expect much from anything with Vin Diesel as the main attraction, I did expect something more from David Twohy.  If you want mindless action and CGI, check this out, but if you wan't a movie with brains you should avoid this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="American Braveheart"></head><body><p>The Mayan Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) gets caught up in a late pre-Columbian (or early Columbian, depending on whose ships those are at the end of the movie) political, religious and social conflict that requires him to survive his village being sacked, being carried away captive, almost sacrificed to a false god, and run for his life while fighting a pack of bloodthirsty warriors in a cross-country obstacle course that combines the best of "The Most Dangerous Game" and First Blood.<br /><br />There's lots of Braveheart-type directing in this movie, which means people yelling and waving blunt weapons as they run, slow-mo, directly toward the camera.  There's lots of hand-to-hand combat that doesn't spare the viewer any gory details.  If you happen to like that type of directing and action -- I know *I* do -- then this is a great movie for you.  Cinematography is superb, sets are lavish, and everyone is in top form.  It's just a well-crafted picture, top to bottom.<br /><br />One other thing.  For me, the subtext of this movie was not so much about the ending of one world -- an apocalypse -- by invasion from another.  The subtext is also not about how morally decayed civilizations are ripe for destruction from outside.  No, for me it's much more personal.  This is something I would've missed when I was younger but is obvious now.  The most important subtext of this movie is "What would you do for your family"?  The answer is, of course, Anything.</p></body></html>

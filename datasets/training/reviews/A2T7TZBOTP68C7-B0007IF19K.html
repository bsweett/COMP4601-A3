What most do not realize is that Ray Charles had been performing since the 1940's until his death in 2004.  This film shows Ray as a vibrant young man and opens our eyes to a whole new world that many have never known, a world that includes segregation and the civil rights movement.  The movie spans from Ray's childhood up until around 1963.  Considering that Ray's career went on for forty years AFTER that is astounding.<br /><br />Ray Charles was born in Albany, Georgia, in 1930.  Growing up in poverty in Florida during the Great Depression, he lost his little brother in a tragic accident that would haunt him the rest of his life.  Around age seven, he went blind from glaucoma.  Ray honed his knack for music at the state school for the blind and deaf.<br /><br />Although a true genius and pioneer of jazz, R&B, and even country western, Ray (Jamie Foxx) was not a perfect human being by any means.  Ray had learned to be fiercely independent from his fiery and dedicated mother Aretha (Sharon Warren), who died when he was fifteen.  Yet he was dependent on a couple of demons - women and heroin.  These addictions had tragic consequences.  The fact that Bea, his long-suffering wife (Regina King), stood by him all those years is an example of the kind of chemistry and love this man inspired.<br /><br />The movie reminds me so much of The Temptations (1998) as far as how the plot unfolds, that I would have given "Ray" four stars if it were not for Foxx's and Warren's performances.  Foxx won Best Male Leading Actor for his sublime performance of a legend and an icon.  Sharon Warren was so intense as Ray's mother.  With her visible biceps on a fragile frame, she embodied the plight of all African Americans during Jim Crow.  I want to see Warren again in a film.  She is absolutely amazing.<br /><br />The movie has sexuality and drug use, but nothing too graphic.  There is no bad language.  All of the songs in the film are Ray's original recordings, lip-synched very well by Foxx and the backup girls.  When I heard that the songs would be lip-synched, I did not think I would enjoy it, but it works very well and was very entertaining.<br /><br />The DVD has commentary by the director, and short readable bios of just about all the main and supporting actors in the film.  It is a little annoying to have to read the white font and keep scrolling endlessly through each bio.</p></body></html>

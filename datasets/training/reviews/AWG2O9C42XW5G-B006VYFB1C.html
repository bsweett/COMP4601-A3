<meta name="summary" content="Boring"></head><body><p>This movie was so boring. the only thing i can say what i liked about this movie was brad pitt's acting. but other than that i found it boring. thats because i really don't know much about baseball. it was just not my type of film. if you are a hardcore baseball fan then this movie is for you. if not then i don't recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

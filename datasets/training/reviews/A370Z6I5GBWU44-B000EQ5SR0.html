<meta name="summary" content="interesting film"></head><body><p>Lots of people don't like this film, but I honestly liked it and thought it better than some other sci-fi movies (including Ultraviolet) Yes, this show is quite different from the TV show, but hey, I liked it, and also liked the story and the weird and cool sci-fi bits and special effects.</p></body></html>

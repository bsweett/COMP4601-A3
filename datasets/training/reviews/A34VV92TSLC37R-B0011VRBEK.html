Oh Dae-su is kidnapped from the middle of the street one night, and we then learn through his narration that he will be in his cell for the next 15 years.  We go through the journey with him, seeing the time pass by as he finds ways to get himself through each day.  Then, miraculously, he is released one day for what appears to be no reason whatsoever.  Once he is released, he sets out to find his captors.  The only clue he has is the food that he ate on every single day for the past 15 years, so he goes to every restaurant named Blue Dragon until he tastes the food he knows so well.  Once he finds out where he was kept, he has to find out who and why, and that is where the film goes crazy.<br /><br />The twists at the end of this film are some of the best I can think of from recent film history.  Not only is the subject matter hard to handle, but the film also features some horrible scenes of violence, and one scene where a live octopus was definitely harmed in the making of the film.  While I'm not in love with this movie (it definitely slows down after the beginning), it is more interesting and original than a lot of stuff that our country has put out recently.  And it was definitely good enough for me to check out the other two parts of Park's vengeance trilogy.</p></body></html>

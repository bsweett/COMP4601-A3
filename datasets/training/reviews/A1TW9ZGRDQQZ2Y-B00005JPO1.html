<meta name="summary" content="My least favorite of the 4 Indy films, but it's still fun"></head><body><p>I love the Indiana Jones films (especially Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade) and while Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was fun, it really didn't live up to the hype. Not that I thought it would in the first place. The acting is solid all around with Harrison Ford (seeming a little tired at times of this role at 65) and the bad chick played by Cate Blanchett being the standouts for me. The adventure itself is a little on the confusing side, but will keep you interested throughout.<br /><br />The two main flaws with Indy IV are the dialogue which is pretty bad at times (some of it comes across okay) and the heavy use of CGI that you can't help but notice.<br /><br />Just don't go in expecting a soon to be classic movie. As far as the fourth film in a series goes, it is actually good enough to sit beside the other three on your DVD shelf.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Will bring a tear to a glass eye"></head><body><p>Everyone's used to seeing Will Smith in the action/funny man role and it does get old after a while. But thankfully, as he's getting older, he's turning to different roles in the last few years, there's been Ali (which I haven't seen, but read some good reviews) and this. (We'll exclude Hitch completely.)<br /><br />Pursuit of Happyness is based on a true story, about a period in a man's life, where absolutely everything that could possibly go wrong, does go wrong. I've kinda been on a downer the past couple of days and this is the perfect movie to help you along if you're in that kinda mood, and I topped my mood off even worse by watching the last couple of discs of the final ever seaon of Quantum Leap. Thoroughly depressed? You bet.<br /><br />Will plays Chris Gardner absolutely brilliantly, and it's a role he's never really done before. I was so involved in the movie that I forgot to even look out for Dan Castellaneta (Homer in the Simpsons) - clue: he asks Chris for a donut! It's a truly heart wrenching story, and I was nearly in tears at some points, from having to bunk down for the night in a men's toilets, to having all the money taken from his account in one swoop. His wife walks out on him, leaving with a five year old son (who's Will's real life son), he's selling something that is probably unsellable, he gets arrested for unpaid traffic tickets, and just when he thinks nothing else can happen, it does.<br /><br />The way this film depicts poverty in America looks extremely accurate and gut wrenchingly honest. It hurts to watch it, but then the movie is enriched by the fact the two actors playing father & son are actually father & son, and it's a great chemistry and bond between them, but must have been hard for Jaden at some points, particularly when he has to be yelled at. He's quite the little scene stealer isn't he? But then so was the old guy who thought the x-ray machine thing was a time machine. He was hilarious, I wanted to see more of him.<br /><br />It's a truly magical movie, and I won't give too much more away than I already have. But if you've seen enough of Will doing the action man movie, this is one to pick up. It's definitely worth it.</p></body></html>

One wanted distraction and this movie provided exactly that, buoyed by James McAvoy's delightful performance as Nicholas Garrigan, a fictional doctor drawn into Idi Amin's web of paranoia and nation-building.  A title tells us this movie is "Inspired by Real Events" but it doesn't let on that its entire frame story is a fictional construct.  We get to see Idi Amin from his doctor's point of view, only we don't of course, that's all just a story-telling gambit.  Those of you who are looking for some sort of docudrama of real events had better look elsewhere.  This is just the same olf story of, LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.<br /><br />Nicholas is a fun-loving hooligan from Scotland with a weakness for healing young children and taking sexual advantage of all the willing black and white women in Africa.  It's 1972 after all, no AIDS on the horizon, so as soon as Nick gets to Uganda he smiles that insouciant grin at a fellow passenger on one of those funky, strap goats to the roof buses they have in movies about Africa, and instantly the two of them are hard at it in a bus shelter.  He's adorable and deserves a special Oscar all of his own for, oh I don't know, cutest grin.  Next up, Gillian Anderson playing the Angelina Jolie part of the heroic white doctor's ignored wife, smouldering in the dust while children not her own die all around with flies on their eyelids.  Her name, Sarah Merritt, also a fictional character.  She falls hard for young Doctor Galligan, and her desire for him only increases as he charms the native children and proves himself a fit ally for her husband.  Before long, he's trying to kiss her under the Ugandan moon, and she gets all skittery like a sixteen year old virgin.<br /><br />The uproar about Forest Whitaker's performance is justified.  He really hollers great, in a new range of basso profundo we haven't heard out of him before.  Voice lessons helped him ease his way into a challenging part, but other than that it's the same old Forest we've loved since THE CRYING GAME and that movie where he's a psychic.  His eyes twitching in different directions, his vapid grin that freezes into a rictus of calculated ire.  The soundtrack of this film features a lot (and I mean A LOT) of Scottish standards re-done in African rhythms, like that movie last year in which every one of Bowie's greatest hits were sung to samba beats by that Brazilian guy.  If you liked that, and so many people do, you will definitely want to add a star to my review of THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The violence feels real, both physically and mentally"></head><body><p>Directed by Stanley Kubrick, this 1987 film packs a terrific wallop as it follows the dehumanization of marine recruits as they are first prepared for Vietnam and later sent there.  As in other Kubrick films which deal with the dark side of human nature, there's a voice-over narrator and some extreme closeups, particular one called "the glare" in which a character tilts his head slightly down with his eyes looking up.  The title itself  refers to a shell casing, a metaphor for the tough hollow fighters that these men will eventually turn into.  And from the first scene, which is that of an off-camera barber shaving the heads of the recruits, we see their depersonalization as their hair, which once made them unique individuals, is shaved off.<p>Boot camp takes up more than half of the film, with R. Lee Emery, a former marine sergeant himself, cast in the role of the drill sergeant.  His creativity in insults and curses is amazing as he prods the weak spots of the men under his command, especially the chubby misfit he labels "Private Gomer Pyle", played brilliantly by Vincent D'Onofrio who won a Golden Globe award for his performance.  Aggression is glorified, with serial killers used as examples of excellent marksmanship as the men are taught to worship their rifles, which they treat as objects of love and recite scripted allegiances to them.  It's not surprising when this training results in an act of violence.<p>The scenes that follow in Vietnam are not as strong as the earlier ones, but clearly show how the training both saves the men's lives and dehumanizes them.  Short, episodic scenes set the stage for the final one, where we see the men have come full circle from the recruits they used to be.  And when they are finished with the battle, war weary and left with the visions of some hard choices they have had to make, they march back to base singing a popular child's song, in which they spell out the words "Mickey Mouse" to a familiar tune.  The resulting effect is chilling.<p>The video moved fast, holding my attention in an iron grip.  I was fascinated and horrified and couldn't keep my eyes off the screen as it bolted along.  I felt the agony of the boot camp experience, especially for the misfit, and the horror of Vietnam, including what it must have been like for the Vietnamese.  The film made a statement about inhumanity loud and strong.  Clearly, it was one of the best war films I've ever seen.  The violence is real, both physically and mentally.  Highly recommended, but be prepared for discomfort.</p></body></html>

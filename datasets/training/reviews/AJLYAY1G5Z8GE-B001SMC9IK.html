<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Movie"></head><body><p>Keanu Reaves play the role of an alien that visits Earth in a human form with the purpose of saving it by destroying its human inhabitants. He escapes from the military and is faced with Jennifer Connely, who tries to convince him to give humans another chance by showing him human's good side. Jennifer was human's only hope left, since their technology was far behind that of the aliens.<br /><br />I really liked the movie. Really well directed and has a quite interesting story. There is actually some meaning and purpose behind the story, unlike other alien movies that depicts aliens as evil creatures that want to destroy humans just for the fun of it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A whole new level of stupidity is reached with this movie..."></head><body><p>SAd. I used to like James Bond movies. even with Timothy Dalton I liked them. even the first one with Brosnan.<p>But this DIA ANOTHER DAY is a bomb. A utterly, silly, ridiculous "action movie", where Bond is not a character anymore, it's just a killing machine, an assasssin, a kind of RAMBO. We simply cannot care about his character and that of Halle Barry, so empty and, in the ultimate case, more cruel than the villains! The movie is an endless series of explosions, explosions, fire, death and more death. All that using a unbeliavable bad taste plot about North Korea, since the actual diplomatic situation with this country.<p>I'll not talk about the lies, they were some of the charm of this franchise, but here they are so stupid that I wanted to puke.</p></body></html>

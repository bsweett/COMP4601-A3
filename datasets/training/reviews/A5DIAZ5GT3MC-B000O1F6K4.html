<meta name="summary" content=""Desperado" Special Edition DVD Review!"></head><body><p>After a couple of average DVD releases, "Desperado" finally gets the SPECIAL EDITION treatmant. The second and most popular in Robert Rodriguez's "Maricahi" trilogy takes a far different approach from its independent predacessor. As Robert explains on the audio commentary, his goal was always to make a low-budget movie that looked like a "big summer blockbuster" and few can deny that he acheived that goal. <p>"Desperado" has Antonio Banderas taking over the Carlos Gallardo role as the mysterious loner with the guitar case full of guns. He is looking to avenge the death of the women he loves at the hands of a Mexican drug cartel. Along for the ride is an ensemble cast which includes Steve Buscemi, Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino, and Danny Trejo. All of these actors pale in comparison to sexy young newcomer Salma Hayek who steals the movie in her major film debut as a librarian who eventually becomes Antonio's love interest. <p>"Desperado" is one of the finest action films to be released in awhile. Only John Woo's "Face/Off" comes to mind when thinking of films released since that have been able to successfully mix stylish action sequences with great dramatic moments. The soundtrack, organized by Robert himself, and consisting a number of Tito & Tarantula tracks, really adds to the atmosphere of the film. Rodriguez has a lot of fun with a story that is esentially a Western genre film and pumps it full of amazing action scenes, hip dialouge, stunning actors, and a soundtrack that compliments it so well. <p>This is by far the best version to drop on DVD yet though it could have stood to include a little bit more behind-the-scenes footage. The director's commentary by Rodriguez is inciteful and the featurette chronicling the "video storyboarding" of the bar shoot-out is impressive but it would have been nice to hear some of the cast look back at the filming of this movie and perhaps, the inclusion of some deleted scenes would have put it over the top. All in all, you really can't complain. It is a quality DVD presentation of an excellent action film.</p></body></html>

This is the kind of no-brainer entertainment that is good fun at the cinema and from this perspective it is actually pretty good.  The story has Jovovich playing a...babe with memory loss who, along with a group of army officers infiltrate an underground research facility called The Hive.  Unknown to the public above this is where the hugely influential Umbrella Corporation has been researching the deadly T-Virus, that reanimates the dead.  However, the Red Queen computer mainframe killed all of the Hive's employees after a security scare.  Now it's up to the cast to find out what went on there.<p>First of all I'll go through everything that's wrong with this movie.  Most glaringly, there are several long scenes which just have the cast shooting at zombies, which I could have seen playing the game at home.  Other things critics have labelled as ridiculous mostly adds to the movie's trashy fun.  For instance, check out the employees of The Hive, all researching a top-secret virus over cups of coffee and all under 25.  On top of that we have Jovovich parading about in a red dress split at the thigh, and whilst the rest of the cast are bitten and maimed she remains with a few delicate smears of dust across her face.  Unfortunately, the story is very inconsistent, and for a while the audience can't be sure what's going on, why Red Queen's mainframe couldn't be overriden from outside and who everyone is supposed to be.<p>Still, there's actually plenty of elements here that mean 'Resident Evil' is a cut above other computer game adaptations.  Despite being almost totally reliant on dumb jump scares, there's a few things here that have the ability to make you recoil in disgust and a few other creepy elements.  For anyone that's seen similar movies, you just know that when we focus in on the dead woman pressed against the glass of a research lab that she'll open her eyes suddenly.  Thankfully knowing what's coming doesn't take away from a lot of genuinely enjoyable aspects.  For example, the Red Queen's manifestation as a little girl is great fun, as are the zombie Dobermans and Michelle Rodriguez is fantastic in what could easily be a very unrewarding role.<p>Although this is certainly no classic, it's a good watch and is a lot better than 'Tomb Raider' or 'Street Fighter'.  Even so, anyone over the age of 30 will be scratching their heads, but that's probably the idea, what with a Slipknot-laden soundtrack.</p></body></html>

I am only concerned with the transfer to Blu Ray.<br /><br />You are provided 2 discs, one has the extended version and the other the theatrical version plus extras.  Since I have this movie on Standard Def and enjoyed it, I thought I might like an extended version on Blu Ray.  There are 10 additional minutes added to the extended version but most of the new or extended scenes, I barely noticed as they really didn't add a whole lot to the movie.  Never the less, they are there and inclusive within the film.<br />On the 1st disc, which is the extended version, there are many previews of other movies and TV shows.  I hated when they do this, I truly do as they just take up valuable room on the disc itself that could go into more extras, cut scenes, less compression in the transfer or any other number of  worthy things.<br /><br />The video transfer is good,  not great, just good.  The standard def version was also good so I don't think you will have an eye popping epiphany of visual delights.  However, there were no artifacts or aliasing and I didn't see any grain to speak of so the transfer to blu ray was pretty decent.<br /><br />The audio transfer to DDHD 5.1 made good use of the front sound stage with some deep bottom end in several parts.  The rear channels were not used very often but some discreet audio to the rears was present, just not too often.<br />This is a fun movie to watch and I am glad to have it now on Blu Ray, however, don't buy it thinking it will be used as a Demo disc to impress yourself or your friends.<br /><br />Now that Amazon has changed their fees in CA to include sales tax, while they are at work on their website, would it be possible that they could separate the standard DVD reviews from the Blu Ray or new versions as they come out.  Come on Amazon, you can do it!<br /><br />At any rate, I hope this review has been helpful to you and, if so, click on the 'of help' button so I know I am on the right track with these reviews.  Thanks</p></body></html>

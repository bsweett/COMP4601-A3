<meta name="summary" content="Back To Basics"></head><body><p>I remember when there was a time we used to watch movies for entertainment, with good editing, good direction & excellent scripts; Alexander Payne did a good job with this movie & went back to the basics to create this masterpiece.<br /><br />The only thing that equally harmed the movie yet made it a success was the hype. A funny thing with hype is that it raises the bar on the quality of the movie which makes it hard to live up to yet with all that publicity the movie has a better success rate. It's a no-win situation.<br /><br />But overall Sideways does come out on top although it's not meant for all audiences (besides the R rating) you need to have gone through the ups & downs of life to experience what Paul Giamatti is going through & me being divorced know exactly how that feels (especially the Xanax phase).<br /><br />Reading some of the earlier reviews, I've noticed reviewers branding Giamatti & Thomas Haden Church, as loosers! Well I don't know about Church but Giamatti is definitely not. There is a thin line between being human with feelings & a looser. People like Giamatti put a lot of emotion & feeling in what they do be it wine tasting, experiencing gourmet cooking or writing a novel so when something goes wrong it sort of eats away at their soul; its more like an amalgamation of midlife crisis, loss & low sense of worth. A deadly combination, whichever way you look at it.<br /><br />There is no shortage of human emotion in this movie although I really thought Giamatti ought to have been nominated for an Oscar as opposed to Church; don't get me wrong I like Thomas Haden Church, I've been a fan of his ever since Wings & Ned & Stacy, he's good, versatile & overall quite believable but I think Giamatti takes the cake in this movie & a great choice for his role.<br /><br />Verdict: Overall quite an enjoyable movie with some really witty dialogue not to mention the mini-plots within the main plot. It strikes a decent balance between good filmmaking & a modern-day romantic comedy.<br /><br />Rating: 4 & ? stars for a well written movie made with a lot of emotion & creditable performance.</p></body></html>

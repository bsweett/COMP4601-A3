For a bloody, violent film the ultimate message is antt-war/pro-peace. Achilles (Pitt) is a non-religious man who sees the ridiculousness in fighting for greed & glory (Agamemnon) or religious folly (Priam). Seems as though our own world leaders could take a lesson.  Eric Bana (Hector) essentially steals the show while Orlando Bloom (Paris) rounds out the cast and makes a fine showing. Again there is more to this film than mindless action and violence. It has a great message, if you have the capacity to understand it.</p></body></html>

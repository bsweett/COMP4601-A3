Starring Diane Keaton, Jack Nicolson, Amanda Peet, and Keanu Reeves Something's Gotta Give is a breezy romp about love at any age. The cast is full of enthusaism and Keaton was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe for her performance as Erica, a successful playwright but lacking a healthy love life. Ultimately love blooms for Erica in the form of her attractive daughter's much older beau. This isn't a perfect film, but Something's Gotta Give will give you a few chuckles here in there.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="better kills,more intense and yes,even horrifying at times (best of the series)"></head><body><p>this is by far the goriest of the series.i can take a lot of gore,but there are a couple of scenes which are almost too much for me.almost,but not quite.the kills are much more gruesome than the two previous movies.also,many of them are very sudden,and came as close to scaring the stuffing out of me as any movie i've seen.the intensity in this one is almost through the roof.there's also some old style horror in some scenes,and by that i don't mean gore,but something like Gothic horror.i think this is the best movie of the series,unusual for a second sequel.i applaud the filmmakers for making a horror movie that is horrifying.and that what this movie is,a horror movie that is also thrilling,and gory enough for all the gore hounds out there.the only thing i didn't like is that most of the,characters(except for 2 or 3) are dumb and shallow and not very likable at all.otherwise,a hugely successful movie that does what it sets out to do.hopefully,this will be the last of the series,since i don't think they can top it. 5/5</p></body></html>

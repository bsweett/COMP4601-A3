This is how the story goes: In the not-too-distant future, some 30 years after the final war, a solitary man walks across the wasteland that was once America. Empty cities, broken highways, seared earth--all around him, the marks of catastrophic destruction. There is no civilization here, no law. The roads belong to gangs that would murder a man for his shoes, an ounce of water... or for nothing at all.<br /><br />But they're no match for this traveler.<br /><br />A warrior not by choice but necessity, Eli seeks only peace but, if challenged, will cut his attackers down before they realize their fatal mistake. It's not his life he guards so fiercely but his hope for the future; a hope he has carried and protected for 30 years and is determined to realize. Driven by this commitment and guided by his belief in something greater than himself, Eli does what he must to survive--and continue.<br /><br />Only one other man in this ruined world understands the power Eli holds, and is determined to make it his own: Carnegie, the self-appointed despot of a makeshift town of thieves and gunmen. Meanwhile, Carnegie's adopted daughter Solara is fascinated by Eli for another reason: the glimpse he offers of what may exist beyond her stepfather's domain.<br /><br />But neither will find it easy to deter him. Nothing--and no one--can stand in his way. Eli must keep moving to fulfill his destiny and bring help to a ravaged humanity.<br /><br />The cast led by Denzel Washington (who also produced) (as Eli) & Gary Oldman (as Carnegie) is great! The directing by The Hughes Brothers (Albert & Allen) (both of them also directed "Menace II Society" (1993, both also co-produced and wrote the story), "Dead Presidents" (1995, both also produced and wrote the story) & "From Hell" (2001, both also executive produced) is great! The story & screenplay by Gary Whitta is great!<br /><br />The music by Atticus Ross is great! The cinematography by Don Burgess (who also did the cinematography to "Forrest Gump" (1994), "Contact" (1997), "What Lies Beneath" (2000), "Cast Away" (2000), & "The Polar Express" (2004), all which were directed by Robert Zemeckis), "Spider-Man" (2002), "Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines" (2003), & the upcoming "Priest" (2010) is great! The film editing by Cindy Mollo is great! The casting by Mindy Marin (who also did the casting to "Up In The Air" (2009), the upcoming "Tooth Fairy" (2010) & "Repo Men" (2010) is great! The production design by Gae S. Buckley (who also did the production design to "Open Range" (2003) is great! The art direction by Christopher Burian-Mohr (who also did the art direction to "The Last Samurai" (2003) is great! The costume design by Sharen Davis (who also did the costume design to "Devil In A Blue Dress" (1995, which also starred Washington and Jennifer Beals), "Antwone Fisher" (2002), "The Great Debaters" (2007), "Out Of Time" (2003), all which also starred Washington), "Ray" (2004), "The Pursuit Of Happyness" (2006), "Dreamgirls" (2006) & "Seven Pounds" (2008) is great!<br /><br />This is a great action film that is a little different than other action films. This is a different looking film that people aren't probably used to. Denzel Washington & Gary Oldman are excellent as usual.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rachel McAdams is going to be a star."></head><body><p>The only reason, and I do mean the 'only' reason to watch this ridiculous film, is the standout performance given by Rachel McAdams.  She shows some incredible range of emotion from helplessness to defiance and I was immediately enamored with her talent as well as her beauty.  Director Wes Craven, know primarily for his groundbreaking work in the horror film genre, takes a day off to try his hand at suspense, Hitchcock-style.  The pace of the film is speedy and sometimes distracted me from the fact I didn't care what was going on, but in retrospect this turns into an incredibly dumb movie.  Nobody here could save a script that starts off promising but eventually veers off onto the shoulder then crashes into a large oak tree.  The plotting goes down far too familiar roads, and I often felt bad for Rachel McAdams trapped inside this predictable story.  She is the saving grace that keeps me from throttling this film down to a 1-star rating.  The more characters that become involved in the plot, the more convoluted the plot becomes.  Early on in the story there are just two characters in an intense situation that may or may not be true.  Perhaps there is a hidden agenda?  The beginning is ripe with possibilities.  But as all is eventually revealed the whole mess becomes just plain ripe.  This movie stinks.  With any other actress in the lead role I am certain I would not have even bothered to finish watching the film at all.  However, keep an eye out for Rachel McAdams.  She is a starlet on the rise.</p></body></html>

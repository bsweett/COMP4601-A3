<meta name="summary" content=""A visual Masterpiece, But That's All They Give Us""></head><body><p>"The Matrix Revolutions" is a celabration on how far we've gotten with CGI, but there's nothing in the film that I can like. Their's bad acting, bad script, the film doesn't give us any ideas or an answer. We get the fact that every one will be free, but free from what, the matrix, or the real world. To be honest with you, I was expecting to be a child in the film, the son of Neo. I thought that was the reason of the dance/love scene in "Reloaded", but no. We get mindless,Mindless action, and you don't even want to know the ending.<br /><br />There's just no point to this story anymore, I don't even want to see the prequals, unless we get to know more about the characters, but I definetly don't want to see the fourth one, if it happens. The Oracle Quotes: "Neo is trapped somewhere between this world and the machine world." This is a sign that the Wachowski's are truly bored of this saga, cause they don't tell us anything about this world between the Matrix and the machine world. But this is a okay film, because of the ending and the visual effects, and the last fight between Agent Smith and Neo is spectacular, but thats all,kinda dissapointing.</p></body></html>

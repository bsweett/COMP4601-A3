<meta name="summary" content="sheaths off to Mr. Zombie"></head><body><p>i sure liked the title to that Rob Zombie disc that came out some years back now . "HILLBILLY DELUXE" . i don't know if that was intended to make me laugh but it sure did . i still laugh hard whenever i think of it . that sort of music is not my cup of tea . this film is however . i love John Carpenter . i fully thought this film would blow . i super like it though . i enjoy seeing all the older familiar horror faces . added to which i feel Rob made an excellent film . no kidding . this is my favorite genre and i really want to give Rob some massive props . i chose not to see his other pictures (all of them) . this one scares the bejesus out of me and entertains me to my eviserated entrails . bloody good Robbie . my copy is on the way . sorry if it's not your thing . not really .</p></body></html>

It's so nice to see these films in all their retouched glory - no more struggling through the grainy VHS transfers, no more distorted sound, etc.  The Casablanca DVD does not disappoint.  In addition to its fine physical reproduction, it is certainly one of the best films ever made.<br /><br />The story (for the few that don't know) - Ilsa and Rick are lovers in Paris at the time of the Nazi Occupation.  They make plans to flee to Morocco, but Ilsa stands Rick up and he has to leave without her.  A year or two later, she finally makes it to Casablanca with a man in tow - her husband Victor, who happens to be an anti-Nazi Czech leader.  This sets up intrigue between the French resistance trying to get Victor away from the Nazis, the Nazis who are trying to imprison him, and the black marketeers who buy and sell exit visas.  Throw in the Rick-Ilsa-Victor love triangle, corrupt Vichy officials, and a healthy dose of humour, and you have a movie that stands the test of time and is more enjoyable each successive viewing.<br /><br />The performances, story, etc. are fantastic.  If the special effects are laughable (and they are!), you don't even notice because you're drawn in and engaged in the story.  The ending is a masterful series of twists, but it never cheats and once you've seen it, it is extremely satisfying but not predictable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, younger viewers are bound to think that the entire film is cliched (as I did, the first time I saw it).  It has been so often imitated that it's unlikely you'll see this before some imitation.  This is especially true of the dialogue - young viewers may even laugh at the cliched lines, not knowing that it was in Casablanca that they all originated: "the usual suspects," "of all the gin joints...," "I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship," etc.  Repeated viewings and the most rudimentary knowledge of cimematic history dispells this problem because the film is so much richer than just its most memorable quotes.<br /><br />This DVD edition has some nifty extras - about 3 hours of Lauren Bacall's reminiscences on hubby Bogart, interviews with film historians, archival footage, etc.  The two commentaries are interesting - one by film historian Rudy Behlmer and the other by critic Roger Ebert.  Ebert's commentary is probably more interesting in that he offers a number of personal opinions (for example, he observes that Henried and Bergman have no chemistry between them, and speculates that Claude Rains's character is meant to be homosexual).  They even found some cut scenes to include.  It's good value for the price, even if you only watch the extras once.</p></body></html>

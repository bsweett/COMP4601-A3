<meta name="summary" content="Misses Potential"></head><body><p>X-Men 3 - the somewhat final chapter in this above average trilogy.  While I throughly enjoyed this movie (after the first X-Men movie came out, I pre-judged it thinking it would be horrid, not the case at all) I do think that this movie missed its potential.<br /><br />I liked the addition of all the new characters, but I believe it may have prevented some of the story development.  After watching "Last Stand" I would really like to see a 4th X-Men movie, but believe there will only be spin-off movies (Wolverine, Magneto).  Plus some fairly major characters die so I think they'd be forced to do a pre-quel.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a good movie that you should definately see, especially if you saw the first two.  Enjoy.</p></body></html>

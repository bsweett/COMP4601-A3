<meta name="summary" content="A Fitting Preparation for the Grand Finale!"></head><body><p>According to the Blu-ray disc Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 will be released in theaters on July 15th and if that isn't enough it will be released in 3-D as well. That should make for a really grand finish to the series. Part 1 is a generally exciting film that holds one's attention very well. Although the section where the three are on the run may seem to slow down the pace, the movie tracks the book pretty well and these scenes provide an opportunity to reveal the emotions with which each of them must deal.<br /><br />I've noticed some negative comments on sound and picture and have just replayed the opening part with the sole intention of evaluating the sound and picture; the results are conclusive, they are both outstanding. The surround speakers are given a terrific workout and the subwoofer is nicely exercised as well. I would give both sound and picture top marks for excellence. The picture is crisp and clear and never too dark so as to mask the action.<br /><br />I would agree that if one had not read the book it could be more difficult to follow the story's turns and twists. If one has not read the book this would be a great time to do just that. I believe it was better to divide the book into two parts so the story could be more systematically covered. I hope the release of the Blu-ray 3D version will not be delayed too long after the movie is released in theaters.<br /><br />In summary, this is an outstanding movie version of the first part of the book and provides a solid platform for the completion of the story. I'm delighted to have this movie as a part of my collection.</p></body></html>

I knew before watching "The Taking of Pelham 123" that I shouldn't like it, and I knew afterword that I probably still shouldn't have enjoyed it.  The same is somewhat true here.  The story is elevated because of the cast - Denzel Washington, as always, turns in a workmanlike performance.  Chris Pine doesn't exactly stretch his acting legs, but he does fine as the new guy.  It's never bad to have Rosario Dawson in your film.  Plus, Kevin Corrigan's in this one.  The story is pretty simple here, and there won't be a lot of surprises.  It's probably worth 90 minutes of your time, though.  The Blu-Ray picture quality was excellent.  I won't comment on the sound quality since I am installing some new flooring and currently have the surround sound in storage - that said, I can only assume that would enhance the viewing.  Overall, the movie has its flaws, but it's a fairly enjoyable ride.</p></body></html>

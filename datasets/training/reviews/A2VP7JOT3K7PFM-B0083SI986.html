The bartender looks up and says, 'Get the [common vulgar word] out of here!'"<br /><br />The above "joke" is said by this movie's main character, Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood, who also directed and produced this movie.)<br /><br />This story follows Walt, a recently widowed Korean War veteran who is alienated from his family and angry at the world.  Walt's young Hmong American neighbour Thao (or "Toad" as Walt calls him) tries to steal Walt's prized 1972 Ford Torino (or, more specifically, a Ford Grand Torino Sport Sports Roof) on a dare from his cousin for initiation into a gang.  Walt develops a close relationship with the boy and his older sister.  The gang does something to the older sister and Walt vows revenge declaring that "They won't stand a chance [against me]."<br /><br />(Hmong or Mong Americans are residents of the U.S. who are of ethnic Hmong decent.  Indigenous Hmong are specifically from the mountainous regions of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Burma. The Hmong are also one of the subgroups of Miao ethnicity in Southern China.)<br /><br />Despite the movie's deceptive simplicity, it evolves into something complex, powerful, and even tender.<br /><br />For those who like lots of mindless action in their movies, this movie can become tedious.  However, those with patience will be rewarded by this movie's end.<br /><br />This movie marked Eastwood's return to leading actor status after four years (his previous leading role was in the movie "Million Dollar Baby").  The then 78-year old delivers a superb performance in what he has said is his final film as an actor.<br /><br />Eastwood can make "Get off my lawn" (while aiming an M-1 rifle) sound as menacing as Dirty Harry's "Make my day."  When he says, "I'll blow a hole in your face and [then] sleep like a baby," he sounds as if he means it.<br /><br />Beware that despite some moments, Walt's toughness is more verbal than physical.<br /><br />This movie features a large Hmong American cast.  Even though the actor who played Thao (Bee Vang) and the actress who play his older sister (Ahney Her) had no previous acting experience, they hold their own with Eastwood and give convincing performances.<br /><br />(Note that Eastwood's young son, Scott, also has a small part in this movie.)<br /><br />The song in the movie titled "Gran Torino" was nominated for the Golden Globe Awards for Best Original Song.  This music was a collaborative effort of four people that included Clint Eastwood (who sings briefly during the end credits) and his oldest son, Kyle Eastwood, who wrote the music.<br /><br />This movie was recognized as one of the ten best films of 2008.  Eastwood's performance gained recognition winning "Best Actor" from the National Board of Review.  As well, this movie has grossed almost ten times more than what it cost to make.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2009) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has two extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is simply a remarkable movie.  I leave you with what Walt says to a young priest, the priest who presided over his wife's funeral:<br /><br />"I think you're an overeducated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of superstitious old ladies and promise them everlasting life."<br /><br />(2008;  1 hr, 55 min;  wide screen, 29 scenes;  rated 'R')<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></body></html>

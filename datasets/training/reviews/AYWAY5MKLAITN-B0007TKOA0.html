<meta name="summary" content="Wine-tastin' Wise Guys."></head><body><p>This movie is packed full of shock moments. It's a story about a pair of buddies . . .<br /><br />1 actor(Thomas Haden Chruch) + 1 Writer(Paul Giamati)= Nonstop laughs.<br /><br />Constantly these two are bickering while sipping wine and carrying on their vacation just before Miles's friend is about to get married. But on the way they encounter two females that will send their lives into an interesting turn.<br /><br />When it gets right down to it, there is too much Dialogue about wine. You get sick of it after a while. Wine this and wine that. It's silly. But Miles, the character we sympathize with, is obssesed with wine . . . and writing. What follows is the ups and downs of two buddies, one wild and one insecure into a nicely awkward comedy that is Sideways.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

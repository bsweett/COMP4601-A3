That's OK.  Sci-fi and action films are supposed to be attractive on screen, then worry about plot, logic, and solid steady direction.  A great deal of effort went into this film and it is very enjoyable as pure escapist entertainment, popcorn jewelry and nothing more.  The special effects are fantastic!  Revolutionary!  Mind Bending!  That's really all you need in sci-fi action.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="OPEN RANGE--A Hopeful Revival For The Western"></head><body><p>For all the hits and misses he has had in front of and behind the camera, Kevin Costner never fails to put his money where his mouth is.  Such is the case with OPEN RANGE, which I hope will revive that most American of film genres, the Western.<p>Set in 1882, OPEN RANGE stars Costner and veteran Robert Duvall as cattlemen only trying to drive their cattle across the open prairie of Montana.  But they soon run afoul of a ruthless land baron (Michael Gambon) out to rid the land of free-grazers like Duvall and Costner; and to prove his point, Gambon has one of Duvall's men (Abraham Benrubi) killed and another (Diego Luna) seriously wounded.  The stage is set for a traditional but classic shoot-out to the finish.<p>If not on the epic level of Costner's 1990 Oscar-winner DANCES WITH WOLVES, or the standards set by people like Clint Eastwood, John Ford, Howard Hawks, or Sam Peckinpah, OPEN RANGE nevertheless demonstrates Costner's comfortability with the Western.  His is a determined performance, and his direction is equally fine, with stunning photography, done on location in southern Canada, and a fine Michael Kamen score.  Gambon is about as nasty a villain as there has been in any film in recent times, and James Russo does his natural evil best as a half-crazed town sheriff.  It is Duvall, a veteran of many westerns (TRUE GRIT; LAWMAN), however, who really shines, as is typical of this kind of caliber actor.  Always offering some wry advice but ready to take retaliation for having been wronged, Duvall is a tower of strength.  Annette Benning also does good work as the town doctor's sister, who also becomes Costner's love interest.<p>The Western genre has not run out of stories or ideas, and never will; it just needs people of integrity like Costner to keep it going.  OPEN RANGE proves that in spades.</p></body></html>

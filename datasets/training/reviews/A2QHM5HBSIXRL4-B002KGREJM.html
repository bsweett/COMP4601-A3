<meta name="summary" content="Forest Whitaker's stellar performance"></head><body><p>Forest Whitaker is spectacular here in his portrayal of Idi Amin in Kevin Macdonald's adaptation of Giles Foden's 1998 novel of the same name.  What makes Whitaker so good is this:  he doesn't portray Amin as some megalomaniac nut from the get-go.  Someone like Amin could only get to the top of the heap through a mix of talent, bravado and charisma.  And that is what Whitaker gets across:  when we first meet his Amin, you're prone to instinctively _like_ the guy.  He's charming, persuasive, personable and charismatic.  James McAvoy's character is immediately won over.  The key to the movie is that the audience has to see why Garrigan (McAvoy's role) is so smitten with a guy the world now associates with unimaginable atrocities.  Whitaker's performance conveys that initial "likeablity" in spades.</p></body></html>

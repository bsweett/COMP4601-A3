<meta name="summary" content="Powerful And Important."></head><body><p>&quot;American History X&quot; is an extremely powerful and important film. It sizzles off the screen with burning intensity. Director Tony Kaye displays his talent as a filmmaker here. His cinematography, both in color  and black &amp; white, makes Venice look like a training ground for the  Apocalypse. Edward Norton gives his best performance. &quot;American  History X&quot; also studies the mechanics of racism and how it feeds into  the minds of weak-spirited individuals, how evil can blind a person's  thought processes and drive that person to committ horrible acts. The music  here is also effective and flows with the film's mood, if not enhancing it.  This is an important film, which I think, should be shown in high schools  around America. It is a powerful study of hate. I just wish that the  screenplay by David McKenna didn't try to cover so much in only a 24 hour  period. &quot;American History X&quot; would have been a classic of modern  cinema had it been at least a 3 hour piece. It doesn't go into the realm of  masterpiece as it would have been with a genius screenwriter and director  like Oliver Stone. Still, this is a powerful, important movie that everyone  should watch.</p></body></html>

In fact, I had my own homemade federation uniform that I wore in the 1960s, especially when the "Original Series" was first running. Still, I appreciate "Galaxy Quest" and its mission, to put STAR TREK conventionalities upside-down. Wow!<br /><br />IT ALL BEGINS:<br /><br />The film opens in a "Galaxy Quest" convention now some 18 years after the show originally aired. The crew of "The Protector" are waiting impatiently and acting neurotically as they await their commander's entrance so they can all make their big entrance at the convention and get this gig over with. The comradeship which seems real on the surface is immediately seen as long-gone among the crew. These actors don't like each other and, most of all, they don't respect, but do detest their "scene-stealing hack" of a Captain, played like the perfectly imperfect backstage James T. Kirk by Tim Allen.<br /><br />BUT THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS:<br /><br />Captain Taggert is happily going through the motions and just soaking up all the hero worship and attention he's getting at the convention by his legions of trekkie-like uniformed fans while his crew just watches with envy from the sidelines. But then as he is making his way into the crowded men's room, Nesmith overhears a group of fans making very nasty comments about what a has-been he [Jason Nesmith] has become and how everyone can see that "even his friends can't stand him". It sounds kind of cliche, but the setting and Tim Allen make it really work and I feel very sorry for him. Jason Nesmith the actor suddenly realizes that his life "obviously" is meaningless and he wants to change this. With this EPIPHANY of sorts, the movie takes on a completely different and unexpected direction at light speed [literally].<br /><br />That direction is comedy. We have good naive aliens that look weird. We have bad "street-smart" aliens that look and act bad and we have sweet gently-cute little aliens that want to eat each other and Nesmith too. We even have some wonderful lampooning of the Star Trek Original Series episode "ARENA" where Nesmith fights monsters against impossible odds and does his customary rolling on the ground antics which never made any sense to me when I saw Kirk doing it almost 40 years ago.<br /><br />But there is more. We even have fans on Earth helping Nesmith get through some of his shipboard ordeals after he explains simply that everything about the show and ship are "all real". Then we have humor almost beyond belief as the logic is based on Trek logic and not what we take for granted as logic.<br /><br />To make a very long story short, Nesmith's goal, to discover real meaning in his life is achieved, but the meaning is something that he earns along with new admiration from shipmates, fans, and aliens alike. All of this is completely integrated with the fans the aliens the starship "Protector" and the TV show enmeshed throughout the film.<br /><br />To call this film thoughtfully made would be an understatment. The ending is very well done and replete with humor, drama and some twists and surprises. When it was all done I truly wished they would make a TV series called "Galaxy Quest" and include "this fine ship and this fine crew".<br /><br />ABOUT THE CAST:<br /><br />Tim Allen is Jason Nesmith who is Captain Peter Quincy Taggert [Capt. Kirk like] on TV's "Galaxy Quest" fictitious program<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver is Gwen DeMarco -"Lt. Tawny Madison - Repeats Computer"<br /><br />Alan Rickman  - Alexander Dane  - "Dr. Lazarus - Advisor"<br /><br />Tony Shalhoub  - Fred Kwan  - "Tech Sgt. Chin - Engineer"<br /><br />Sam Rockwell  - Guy Fleegman  - "Crewman Guy - Expendable"<br /><br />Daryl Mitchell  - Tommy Webber  - "Loredo - Helmsman"<br /><br />Enrico Colantoni  - Mathesar  - "Good Alien Leader"<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />This is perhaps the one glaring shortcoming of this film. It has very few features. It has a few deleted scene segments, a short featurette and some short abridged filmographies. It was in Widescreen and the transfer was flawless. Dreamworks could do much better for features as this type of film attracts the kind of fans that really appreciate "Special Features".</p></body></html>

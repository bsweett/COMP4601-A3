The depiction of an overboard military, political and scientific response to the invading Christmas tree ornaments was laughable. Script and acting were high school acting sophomoric. The science/technology was so absurd that any decent high school science student could poke innumerable holes in this movie. Producers do not want to hire science advisors because a dumbed down product makes more money. One example demonstrates the whole movie: To convey the emotional/informational impact of the moment the director does nothing more than a prolonged camera close up of a pretty face as the FIRST person to approach the alien space ship. That time worn shot is as creative as they can be? And, why a microbiologist (of all people) would be allowed to walk up and touch it is beyond comprehension. CSI crime scenes show more intelligence.</p></body></html>

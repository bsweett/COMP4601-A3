<meta name="summary" content="A Scottish tale"></head><body><p>Brave Heart  DVD<br /><br />Mel Gibson directed and stars in this epic biographical portrait of William Wallace, a 13th century Scottish rebel, who led an unsuccessful insurgency against oppressive British rule.<br /><br />I knew a boy, growing up whose name was William Wallace.  I had no idea who he had been named for.  His Mother was a librarian, I guess she did.<br /><br />Great movie and I highly recommend it for fans of Mel Gibson and Scottish action buffs.<br /><br />Gunner  March, 2008</p></body></html>

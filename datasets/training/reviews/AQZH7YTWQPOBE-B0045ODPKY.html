<meta name="summary" content="Another excuse for Angelina to run around like an action hero"></head><body><p>It seems Hollywood will take any excuse to get Angelina Jolie running around with a gun and makeup. The plot of this movie is laughably bad. It revives Cold War fears of Russian sleeper agents, except Jolie's character Salt can take on squads of Americans without getting a scratch. The movie does a good job at keeping the audience guessing, to the point where I was even surprised by one or two of the plot twists. But overall it's fairly predictable and silly. I'd give it 2 stars, plus an additional star for managing to make Angelina Jolie look hot as both a blonde and brunette.</p></body></html>

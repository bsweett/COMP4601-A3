The plot and the conflicts all seemed to be familiar; EtGA is little more than a re-hash of the first movie. (I won't even get into issues of historical accuracy--I don't think anyone expected much in that regard). Very tiresome.<br /><br />Plus, seeing the Queen of England riding around the battlefield in plate armor like some kind of Joan of Arc was just a little too much to swollow...<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Film Impervious To Criticism"></head><body><p>This is a film that occupies the rarified air of being hard to dislike.  Comic ground isn't broke here but writer-star Nia Vardalos is such an engaging personality that you tend to overlook that.  Explain, however, the phenomenon that this movie was in 2002.  I was dating a Cuban lady that summer and she related to film because of it's portrayal of a tight-knit ethnic family.  At the time I didn't really understand.  Since then I've married into a tight-knit Polish American family and after many plates of kielbasi, pierogies, and gallons of borscht I get it.  All I have to say is that Ian (John Corbett) is one patient dude.</p></body></html>

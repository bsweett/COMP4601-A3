You've got a cast of well-known actors, at least a few anyway. You've got the requisite "save the world" theme. You've got the requisite moral quandaries. And you have the "do or die" dialogue necessary for an apocalyptic action film. With these components in full view, how could the movie do anything but succeed? Unfortunately, the mindless, mediocre plot with more holes in it than a pound of swiss cheese ultimately sinks "The Core." Perhaps Tinseltown can't help itself anymore; they are so desperate to bring in audiences that they'll heap more and more eye candy atop a shallow premise if they think people will buy into it. Movies like this one have finally convinced me that the airheads in Hollywood think most people are idiots. No wonder we have to put up with the political natterings of Babs Streisand, Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, and Rob Reiner; these folks actually think everyone else is so stupid that what they say will sound like the learned musings of brilliant minds. The next time you see one of these "celebrities" on a political talk show belching out the latest far left dogma, remember that these are the people responsible for films like "The Core."<br /><br />The plot is so simple a two year old could summarize it (and probably see through it, as well). At the start of the film, we see about thirty people keel over for no discernable reason. The military calls in a couple of big shot professors, one of them Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) from the University of Chicago, to ask them whether the fatalities were due to a terrorist attack. Nope, say the professors, and that's the end of it until a bunch of pigeons go nuts in London. Suspecting something is amiss, Keyes and a couple of his graduate students figure out that the earth's magnetic fields are going bonkers. Moreover, he concludes, with the help of arrogant government scientist Dr. Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci), that the planet's core no longer turns as it should. If the problem is not corrected in a short period of time, the results will prove catastrophic: electrical storms of savage proportions and the solar wind will turn the globe into a blasted ball of dirt within a year or two. Fortunately, the government knows of a way to possibly avert such an unpleasant series of events. It won't be easy, not by a long shot, but it could be possible to send a crew of humanity's best to the center of the earth in order to restart the core, thus arresting impending destruction.<br /><br />Conveniently for us peons, the smart people have a few tricks up their sleeves. First, there's Dr. Ed Brazzleton (Delroy Lindo) mucking around out in the desert with a laser contraption that will cut holes through solid rock in a matter of seconds. Too, this guy just happened to invent a substance that will withstand massive amounts of heat and pressure--called with a straight face "unobtanium"--that will make for the perfect shell to any potential underground craft. Yippy! Now all the government has to do is bring on board hotshot space shuttle pilot Major Rebecca Childs (Hilary Swank), along with the best computer hacker in the world (D.J. Squalls), and the mission is a go. Everything's slapped together in a matter of months, amazingly enough, and the team sets out with a bunch of nuclear bombs to set matters aright. Predictably, all sorts of problems emerge that the team must deal with to complete the mission. Also predictably, most of the crew perishes in the attempt. There are even a few moral quandaries tossed in for good measure so we can learn how the various team members grow as a result of the difficulties encountered. Am I giving anything away when I say that the mission eventually succeeds? Nope.<br /><br />I'm not saying this picture doesn't have its uses. "The Core" is fun in a so bad it's acceptable sort of way, although it cannot compare to the endlessly entertaining atrocities brought to us from Ed Wood, Jr. or Herschell Gordon Lewis. This picture relies on those immensely overused tried and true formulas straight from the stilted minds of La La Land. There's the evil government weapons project, the secretive military/industrial complex, rampant and ludicrous environmentalism, and fruitcake science all wrapped up with a pretty bow for your viewing pleasure. Overall, the movie does entertain if for no other reason than you can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the whole thing (and the lousy CGI effects). The one scene that arguably takes the cake is how the surviving crewmembers manage to steer the shattered remains of the vessel from the center of the earth to the surface without using the rock cutting lasers. I can't repeat the phrase I blared out repeatedly as I witnessed this inanity unfold. Oh brother!<br /><br />Aside from the film, which runs an amazing two hours plus, the DVD comes with a bunch of extras. After watching "The Core," you can listen to a commentary track with director Jon Amiel, view deleted/extended scenes, learn about the special effects seen in the movie, and watch a "making of" documentary. Trailers included on the disc are "Timeline," "Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life," and a promo for the "Indiana Jones" boxed set. I can think of dozens of science fiction films worth watching instead of "The Core." But if you want to laugh out loud at antics wallowing in sheer absurdity, this one might well serve your purposes.</p></body></html>

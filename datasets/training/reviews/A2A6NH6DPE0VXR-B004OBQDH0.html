<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Potters!"></head><body><p>After finding the Half Blood Prince to just be dark and dull, I wasn't looking forward Deathly Hallows: Part 1 much at all. With that said though, I was pleasantly surprised how well done the movie was.<br />  The film isn't just dark with barely any charm or laughs like the last film. There's plenty of magic, excitement and heart-felt moments that will keep you entertained through-out. This Potter is easily one of the years best and one of the best Potters!</p></body></html>

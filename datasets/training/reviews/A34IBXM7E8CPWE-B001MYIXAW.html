<meta name="summary" content="Very Well Done...See This Before the Americanized Version Comes Out!"></head><body><p>I just finished John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel yesterday and was interested to see how the story was captured on film so I watched the DVD last night. I have to say this is one of the rare cases where I actually liked the film better than novel, but I have to qualify that by saying that if I hadn't read the novel, I wouldn't have enjoyed the film as much as I did. Does that make sense?<br /><br />The basic storyline is that 12 year old Oskar is an outsider, bullied at school, living with an overbearing mother and he fantasizes about killing his classmates. Eli is a young girl who moves in next door to Oskar and the two strike up a friendship. But Eli is an outsider as well...for much darker reasons.<br /><br />Because I'm not into spoilers I won't say any more. I do recommend you read the novel before viewing, you will get much more from the film that way. Also, if you are hoping this is another "Twilight" keep looking. "Let the Right One In" is actually more of a drama than a horror film.<br /><br />I think the movie clicks for so many reasons, Lindqvist adapted the novel himself and wrote the screenplay. The novel is so melancholy, and Lindqvist adds a few touches to the story that help lighten it up a bit. Don't get me wrong, this isn't going to be "the-feel-good-movie-of-the-year" no matter how you cut it, but it's not steeped in the morose tone that the novel is. Simply becuase of the 2 hour running time, quite a few aspects of the original story are altered, glossed over, or left out altogether. I have to say I was disappointed Hakan's story was cut short and altered and I would have liked to see Eli's back-story included. But I understand the reason for their removal.<br /><br />I think the reason the film worked so well, and why I enjoyed it so much was simply the acting performances turned in by the two young stars. Kare Hedebrant as Oskar does a great job! The young actor's expressions, the emotions he conveys with simply looks were amazing, you really felt for Oskar. And to top it off, Lina Leandersson as Eli is equally as good. I was very interested to see who the cast as Eli. She had to be sympathetic, but also have that edge of danger and mystery that make the character so enjoyable. Lina captures Eli perfectly, at times seeming much older than 12, yet still maintaining a child-like quality. The two young stars do such a great job, I can't picture anyone else attempting these roles.<br /><br />Which leads me to this, watch this version of the film. From what I understand, Hollywood has gotten their hands on this thing and you just know it's going to be watered down pap. The title is even being changed to "Let Me In"...is this the Big Bad Wolf story??? Knowing how Hollywood works, they will probably cast a couple kids from the Disney Channel, pack the soundtrack with crap by American Idol contestants, and have the kids wearing all black to show how "deep" they are.<br /><br />Pick this up, make sure you get the corrected subtitles, and simply enjoy.</p></body></html>

The production, screenwriting, and musical score made this classic what it is after 45 years.  This film has indeed deserves its coveted place among the American Film Institute's 100 all-time best films.<br /><br />The actors along with the plotline pulled the film off with flying colors.  However, Hitchcock uses the same cat and mouse espionage that he used in his earlier film, Saboteur,, which captured the fear and paranoia of World War II.  Despite that somewhat unoriginal film idea, Cary Grant, Eve Marie Saint, James Mason, and Martin Landau were quite convincing in this thriller of a film full of suspense and intrigue.  And the romance between marketing advertising executive,Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant),  and stranger on the train, Eve Kendall (Eve Marie Saint) did not hurt the film at all. What would a Hitchcock film be without that tinge of femininity and Eve Marie Saint's glowing profile?<br /><br />This is one of those films where you're rooting for the "good guy" over the "bad guys".  Indeed, this film has political overtones of the Cold War and McCarthyism.  Could this be a film with nationalistic fervor?  Could this have been a film about US consumerism and the sinister USSR?  Possibly, but it's a "hot" picture amongst the "coldness" of the period.  It captures the American landscape with New York's metropolis, which includes the UN building.  In addition, the wheat fields of the Midwest to Mount Rushmore keeps you hanging at the edge of your seat; Cary Grant holds on to dear life both from a crazed-out cropdusting plane to the heads of Jefferson, T. Roosevelt, Lincoln,and Washington.<br /><br />This film is perfect for the movie buff or anyone who enjoys watching a well-crafted film.  Indeed, the 1950s had not been all about the neat fixings of suburbia and "Leave it to Beaver." You had Alfred Hitchcock to draw you back to reality, but in sophisticated film form.</p></body></html>

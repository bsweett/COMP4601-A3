Sets were constructed, costumes were designed, and lighting was used to optimize how the movie would look on black and white film. Why would anyone think it was doing the film any favors to colorize it decades later?<br /><br />In the interest of full disclosure, and from the screen captures I've seen, the colorization on the most recent release (Two-Disc Collector's Set from 2007) is the best so far. But still, for me, the B&W of this classic film is still classic.</p></body></html>

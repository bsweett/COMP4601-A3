<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's Final Film Stirs Controversy"></head><body><p>From his introduction into filmdom's big time with "Spartacus" to the widely discussed "Doctor Strangelove" Brooklyn born Stanley Kubrick was immersed in frequent controversy.  It was only natural, therefore, that reacton to his final film "Eyes Wide Shut" sent the brilliant director out in a blaze of controversy.<br /><br />British screenwriter Frederic Raphael, who secured an Oscar for the 1965 drama "Darling" with Julie Christie and Dirk Bogarde, recounted in his book "Eyes Wide Open" which dealt with his relationship with Kubrick, recalled how he got a call from the director one day about a potential project.  The novel he was sent as an adaptation possibility he guessed to be a work by Austrian Arthur Schnitzler, a friend of Sigmund Freud.  Like Freud, Schnitzler was interested in exploring the sexual side of humanity as a clue and index to the species as a whole.<br /><br />That initial call resulted in close collaboration with Kubrick sending a cab to Raphael's South Kensington flat near Gloucester Road and transporting him to his suburban London mansion in quiet and leafy St. Albans.  Kubrick was a man of privacy and after he was satisfied with Raphael's adaptation of Schnitzler's novel "Traumnovelle" he undertook a vigorous 400 day shooting schedule that saw him succumb to death before the film could be completed.  The setting was moved from 1920's Vienna to 1990's Manhattan.<br /><br />Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, then married, developed such a close bond with Kubrick during the filming that he ultimately became a surrogate father of sorts to the attractive couple.  They were compelled to juggle their schedules and eliminate other work opportunities as the production was extended while perfectionist Kubrick insisted that as much time as was necessary would be taken to finish what he hoped would be a fitting masterpiece to culminate a brilliant career.<br /><br />Cruise and Kidman play a highly successful yuppie couple.  Cruise is a doctor while Kidman runs a gallery.  One night after coming home from a party, while Kidman is particularly high on marijuana, she picks an argument with him on the subject of sex.  She tells him about a Cape Cod weekend in his company when she observed a handsome young naval officer.  Kidman confesses that at that point, had the officer been willing, she would have given up her marriage to have sex with the stranger.<br /><br />Kidman's revelation results in Cruise exploring sex in Manhattan.  He observes an instance of child molestation in which an angry father berates the men seeking to take advantage of his young daughter, who begins flirting with Cruise when she shows up to rent a costume.  The costume is needed to crash a sex party at a Long Island mansion that features costumed participants wearing masks.  Before they engage in sexual activity a cult ceremony is performed.  Cruise looks out of place, is discovered, and told to leave.  Patient and friend Sydney Pollack, who was also an attendee, later warns Cruise of the dire consequences of ever crossing such powerful people.<br /><br />During Cruise's wild night of adventure he meets and befriends a prostitute.  He pays her following conversation without exacting sex.  Cruise later learns that she had terminal aids, recognizing how he had barely dodged a sexual bullet.<br /><br />Eventually Cruise realizes following his sexual exploration how much Kidman means to him.  At film's end they are seemingly closer together than ever.  The resulting irony is that following this film the couple in real life terminated their own marriage.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Marvellous Restoration"></head><body><p>I can't believe the clarity of this DVD. You could swear that this movie was made yesterday by the eye popping color. I've seen some great restorations but this is by far the best, even moreso considering that this film is now 64 years old. Disney have outdone themselves.<p>The movie itself is entertaining although it does seem a bit European at times. It does not take place in any particular country but some of the dwarves sound like they are from Kentucky. The abundance of cute animals and a surprisingly cruel villain keep this story watchable. I mean we have heard it a million times before but the dwarves have more character than Snow White who does nothing but look pretty. And who doesn't want the Evil Queen to get what's coming to her.<p>The supplements on the DVD are MASSIVE and too many to even mention. Let me just say that if you are a fan of the film you certainly WON'T be dissapointed. This baby is loaded and bursting at the seams. <p>The DVD is in 1.33:1 full frame and is in Dolby 5.1.<p>Thanx Amazon. :)</p></body></html>

This is a movie that prefers building an atmosphere of dread over using shock tactics, dialogue over violence, and atmosphere over frantic chases, and it still manages to be an incredibly engaging film. Of all the movies I saw this year, I will admit this to be among my favorites, and I am a bit of a film snob.<br /><br />The thrust of the story concerns Tom Cruise's salt-and-pepper-haired hitman Vincent and Jamie Foxx's uber-professional cabbie Max. Credit where credit is due, Mark Ruffalo and Jada Pinkett-Smith both make very strong impressions in minor roles. This movie, however, is all about Vince and Max. Mann's use of striking imagery and perpetual darkness turn Los Angeles into a dark, almost mystical locale, and the mood is perfectly set for what follows. Max, of course, picks up Vincent at the airport and ferries him around the city of angels at gunpoint in order to off witnesses in a drug case. Max, you see, is intent on moving on to better things, but although he is a staunch professional, you get the sense that he's never going to get enough traction to move out of where he is. Ironically, Vincent provides the impetus he needs to move out of his corner, if he survives the night. Both the leads turn in what could be called the best performances of their careers: the suave, frigid Vincent is the role Cruise was born to play. He really gets into it here, and like his best performances, he gets to be cruel and edgy. Foxx is very moving in the film, endowing Max with great humanity. Overall, this is a hardly conventional and very enjoyable movie that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking for an intriguing character study and an invigorating film.</p></body></html>

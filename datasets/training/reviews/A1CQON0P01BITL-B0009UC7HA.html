<meta name="summary" content="4 for a rental"></head><body><p>This was pretty good for a rental; Action like Indiana Jones...funny and entertaining. Some of it was way far fetched but had a good storyline. They could have gotten someone better for the part Penelope Cruz played...someone more entertaining.<br /><br />If you are wanting a good rental...this would be it!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It fails to fully examine racism in this country."></head><body><p>'American History X' fails to examine racism in the United States simply because the average person in not a Nazi skinhead.  This movie shows the most extreme side of racism; the side that is so filled with hate that it causes someone to murder.  Although certain moments are powerful and moving, other moments are very ridiculous.<br />The basketball game with the whites vs. blacks is embarassing and so is the scene where Edward Nortan tries to stuff meat down his own sister's throat.  It is manipulative filmmaking; the filmmaker wants to scare the audience with the evil main character.<br />Ed Norton is then thrown in prison for killing two blacks, and then faster than you can say 'Adolf Hitler' in German, he is changed forever.  He is no longer the genocidal skinhead, but is an open-minded good guy who wants to save his brother from the skinhead groups.  All of this happens so abruptly it is unconvincing.  Let me tell you the real reason why Ed Norton's character changed; he did not want to go back to prisom where he would be gang raped.<br />A genuine film about racism would be showing about average people and their racist beliefs.  That is the real racism in America; the subtle stuff that goes on behind closed doors in homes.  Not this.  This show the very extreme of racism and even that is exaggerated.</p></body></html>

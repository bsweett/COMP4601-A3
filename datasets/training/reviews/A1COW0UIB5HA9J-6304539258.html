<meta name="summary" content="The greatest movie of all time finally gets it's theatrical release on DVD!"></head><body><p>Long ago in a galaxy far away, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) has kidnapped by the evil Darth Vader (Played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones). She sents out two special robots named C-3PO (Voiced by Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) to a plaet to find someone named Obi-Wan Kenobi (Sir Alec Guiness) as he is Leia's only hope. A farmboy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil) somehow finds the droids then takes them to a sleazy alien bar where they meet lovable smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and furry friend Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). They all join forces together, as they must try to rescue the princess and stop Darth Vader's sinister plan.<br /><br />What is there to say about this movie? it launched a new hope in Sci-fi and fantasy movies, it started out as an idea by George Lucas when he wrote the script, story and even created the SW universe as he wanted to sell this to Universal or United Artist. Then later, 20th Century Fox bought the rights to his movie and a year later the film was finished and had an unexpected success. The film was embraced by both audiences and critics as it as a masterpiece unlike anything they ever seen, a phenomeneon was born. The film itself offers great performances, spectacular special effects, a good storyline and non-stop entertainment all the way! The film spawned two sequels, three prequels, neverending merchandise, imitators, video games, toys and other cool stuff.<br /><br />This DVD has for the very first time the classic first movie in it's original un-special edition version with some of the stuff that was left out from the 1997 special edition re-issue such as the werewolf-esque creatures, no Jabba the Hut, and of course the purist's fans much loved scene where Han shoots first. This also included the 1997 special edition, the picture on both movies are nicely remastered and this is guaraneteed to satisfy SW fans who brought the trilogy on DVD in it's boxset.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A terrific movie, in some ways even better than the book"></head><body><p>They got it about 85% right in the first Harry Potter movie; they got it 110% right in the second one.  "Chamber of Secrets" is a marvelous fun-ride that in some ways outdoes the book.  The cast is back, with one great, sinister addition.  Harry is a deeper character this time around; he's stronger, more sure of himself, starting to realize his potential; he's going to be a force to be reckoned with.  Ron is more grown-up now that he has his little sister Ginny to look after at school.  Hermione is less whiny and know-it-all than she was in the first movie; she's nicer to have around this year.  And a wonderfully malevolent addition to the cast this time around is Lucious Malfoy, Draco's evil father.  We can see where the kid got his mean streak from; Dad is so evil he's almost demonic.  The movie is a lot more fun to watch than the first one; we dispense with the boring muggles (after Dobby the house-elf has played havoc with the family by crashing a party and dropping a cake on a guest's head) and go zooming back to Hogwarts in a flying (stolen, but so what?) car.  Wow, does it feel great to be back!  Only this year, the Chamber of Secrets, a hidden room known only to its creator, Salazar Slytherin, and his star pupil, the young You-Know-Who, has been opened after fifty years, and the resulting mayhem threatens to close Hogwarts for good.<p>The film runs for a good two and a half hours, but at such a clip that it seems a fraction of that time.  The special effects are better than they were in the first movie and add to the excitement.  What really makes "Chamber of Secrets" a better movie than its predecessor is that while "Sorcerer's Stone" seemed to keep looking over its shoulder to make sure it was following the book correctly, "Chamber" just kicks back and has a ball; this movie knows where it's going and it takes us along for a thrilling ride.  One walks out of the theater wanting to walk right back in and see it all over again.</p></body></html>

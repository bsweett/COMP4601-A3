Heavily influenced by kung-fu flicks, Tarantino set expectations at an unusually high level for the second part, promising itself to be a Western pastiche.  Of course, Tarantino is hardly a conformist and what initially struck me when watching Volume 2 was that it seemed to take great glee in undermining all my expectations of the Western elements I was looking for.  Take the promised backstory to the massacre at the chapel - we get a tense work-up with Bill coming to visit The Bride and then we hear but never see the massacre that ensues.  Take Budd, a bloated has-been who sits in his trailer guzzling beer and wearing a cowboy hat, the very picture of a genre truly dead and buried, past its glory days.  It's clear from here that Tarantino's toying with his audience's expectations, becoming a true master of suspense (notably in the scenes with Bill) and showing us what 'Western' means today.  It's not cops and robbers and epic gunfights but trailer trash violence Jackass-style where old-school warriors are misfits in a dead landscape.<p>Still, Tarantino's not lost his love of retro-pastiche and these still provide his most entertaining sequences.  The fight with Daryl Hannah is hilariously brilliant, with the two heroines reduced to fighting with foodstuffs and toilet bowls.  This and the training sequences between The Bride and Pai Mei.  Using the zoom shot, the begrudging cruel master and cheesy fight scenes, Tarantino manages to give his love for the genre with a touch of humanity when we get to see how The Bride uses her teachings to break free of a coffin in which she has been buried alive.<p>The main criticisms levellled at Volume 2 seem to be that it is slower than Volume 1 and has a masochistic attitude towards women.  The first is admitedly true in sequences and this never reaches the freewheeling fun of Volume 1, though once it gets going, Volume 2 is just as much a force to be reckoned with and is certainly anything but stale.  The second is a hard one, especially seen as The Bride is put through just about every kind of punishment possible, be it torture, near-death or the loss of her daughter.  In particular, the resolution, where an assassin grants her life because she's pregnant might seem hokey.  But Tarantino pulls it off to make this self-proclaimed 'roaring rampage of revenge' exciting and fun enough to get past any sentimentality.  A lot of people sneered at her love for Bill, but surely this was levelled by the apparent respect she had for him and Tarantino's acknowledgement that love cannot be simply transformed into hate so simply.  Thurman gives it her all as well, proving that she's one of the best actresses of her generation in a role that will probably define her for years to become.  She's impressed in her roles in Pulp Fiction and Gattaca, but never before has her performance been so determined and committed.  Of course, she's helped by a superb supporting cast.  Carradine exudes a surprising degree of menace and Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen are both a hoot.<p>Okay, so Volume 2 isn't perfect, but along with its first part, it's the one of the most interesting, thrilling cinema treats in a fair while and even if the style isn't really your cup of tea, it's sheer exuberance (not to mention Tarantino's obvious talent and attention to detail) should be applauded.</p></body></html>

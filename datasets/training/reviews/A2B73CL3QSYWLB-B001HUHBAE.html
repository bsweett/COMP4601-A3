Such a film is "Zodiac".  I give credit to director David Fincher for not offering up exploitation fare and trying to give food for thought.  The film's first half is the more successful when the manhunt for the serial killer that terrorized Central California in the late Sixties and early Seventies is fresh and the tensions are more ratcheted.  It's in the second half of the film where it falters slightly.  I give props to the film for concentrating on the psychological impact the manhunt takes on the killer's pursuers.  It's just the way it is told is just a tad meandering.  I'm not going to complain about the length of the film because there are so many examples of great films that exceed 2 and one-half hours.  But in this case the point that's trying to be made is bludgeoned to death and you get a sense of ennui about the whole enterprise.  By all means see "Zodiac" because it's better than most fare.  The acting is terrific particularly Mark Ruffalo as a beleagered homicide detective.  Brian Cox has a terrific cameo as famed defense attorney Melvin Belli.  The makers of the film were so meticulous in their research of the period that they had to mention Belli's appearance on "Star Trek".  An intriguing film that could have been more than it is.</p></body></html>

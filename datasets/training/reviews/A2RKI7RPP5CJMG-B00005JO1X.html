<meta name="summary" content="A Brilliant Tale For The Entire Family"></head><body><p>"The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" is a wonderful film that the entire family will enjoy.  Since I have not read the books, I am basing my review only on the film.  In this tale, the four Pevensie children are cast into the magical world of Narnia via the Professor's wardrobe.  Once inside, the children learn that they are part of a prophecy that will lift the dark curse of the White Witch and save Narnia's magnificent inhabitants.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, one of the first things that I noticed about this film was how the entire young audience remained quiet throughout the entire film.  In fact, the only real noise in the theater was the whimpers of younger children afraid of what happens to Aslan the lion in the film.  That's a difficult thing to do these days, especially since most kids are either easily distracted or their parents ignore them or don't even take them to the movies, preferring to drop them off at the kiddie show whilst they take in other fare.<br /><br />The story is wonderful.  I've read and watched interviews with the producers, directors, actors, etc. in this film and all of them were posed the obvious "Christian" questions about the film.  It's apparent that Disney wanted to tone down the "Christian" quotient in the film since most of the answers to the Christianity questions were downplayed.  However, C.S. Lewis' Christian aspects in this film are very evident, and I have nothing but praise for Disney for taking a chance and allowing the Christian themes to flow freely throughout the film.  Okay, so a few athiests and non-Christians will miss out on a wonderful adventure due to their prejudices.  As far as I'm concerned, it's their loss.  The Christian aspects of this story are key to its development and if you are only remotely familiar with the Gospels, you will quickly pick up on the symbolism of the four children, the White Witch, and, the most obvious of all, Aslan.<br /><br />There are moments of humor in this film that give youngsters a break in the rather high drama of this tale.  Most of that humor is provided by Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, although young Lucy Pevensie almost steals the show with her cheery mood and big, innocent eyes.  The love between the children in this film is almost non-existent in movies these days, and it is refreshing to see a family that actually loves one another.<br /><br />There is also a rather violent aspect to this film.  This violence is doled out by the White Witch and her minions.  There are a number of creatures in this film that will likely frighten younger children, though the outcome of the battle between good and evil should settle most of their fears.  In fact, the only truly scary moment in this film occurs during the sacrificial sequence of a particular character.  In all honesty, this twenty-nine-year old almost broke down and cried at this pivotal moment in the film.  Of course, as a Catholic, this particular part of the film means a little bit more to myself than it may to others.  Also, the action and violence is primarily shot in close-ups, with a few exceptions.  One character does die a rather swift death that is visible to everyone, but most of the other deaths are dealt with tastefully and on a level that most kids can handle.<br /><br />The special effects are very, very exceptional.  Though not quite up to par with "Lord of the Rings" in the effects department, I have to admit that the effects are rather brilliant since there are many more talking animated creatures in this film than in "Rings."<br /><br />The actors and actresses in this film, especially the youngsters, are wonderful.  The two oldest Pevensie children, Peter and Susan, are played by William Moseley and Anna Popplewell.  Moseley's character takes on a father-figure role and while he often hesitates when making decisions, he always does what he feels is right for his siblings.  Popplewell, though sometimes motherly, is best seen as the protective older sister.  She has a deep connection to her little brother and sister and accepts them wholly, good and bad aspects combined.  Skandar Keynes plays Edmund, the "prodigal son" of the four children.  His character probably develops more than any other in the film.  Young Georgie Henley nearly steals this entire film as little Lucy Pevensie.  Her innocent curiousity gets the ball rolling in the adventure, and her face lights up the screen time and time again.  Aslan is voiced by Liam Neeson.  There should be no other choice in my opinion.  His voice gave Aslan a regal quality, yet you could feel the fear within him when he makes a key decision in the film.  Tilda Swinton rounds out the cast of key characters as the sinister White Witch.  She lures young Edmund into her trap with "sweeties" in an attempt to prevent the prophecy from coming true.  She is cold and calculating, and her battle with Peter is one of the most exciting bits of this picture.<br /><br />This film will keep everyone's eyes glued to the screen.  For those who consider this film boring or childish, I'm betting that those particular people are, for the most part, non-Christians.  I'm not attacking anyone in particular, but if you don't have the "tolerance" to look past something that might be offensive to you, then you aren't as tolerant as you demand others to be.<br /><br />If you are a Christian, I suggest you let your children watch this film, no matter what their age.  Trust me, it's a lot easier on the eyes and the heart than "The Passion of the Christ."  If you simply enjoy wonderful fantasy tales like "Lord of the Rings," then this movie is right up your alley.  Highly recommended and I will definitely purchase this film when it comes out on DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Sin City" Blew Even My Extremely High Expectations Away"></head><body><p>I just got back from seeing Sin City in a sold out theater and everyone walking out was talking about the many memorable scenes and performances. Mickey Rourke absolutely stole the show as Marv. Not only was his character the best of an amazing bunch of interesting folk throughout the film, but his story was also the strongest of the three. Other major standouts would have to be Elijah Wood in a silent, yet creepy role as the serial cannibal named Kevin, Bruce Willis as one of the few characters in the movie that proves to be more on the good side of right and wrong, Benicio Del Toro (great casting choice here: 2nd Best Performance Behind Rourke's Marv), Nick Stahl as a less creepy, but still effective version of a Kevin like pyscho, and Devon Aoki as the silent killer for the prostitutes. Now those are just the many standouts to me in a cast with only one semi-weak performance turned in by Brittany Murphy (but by her standards this is a decent one). There are also plenty of lovely ladies for guys like me to drool over, especially Jessica Alba and Carla Gugino who shows off her immaculate body. The visual look of the film is stunning of course and the direction is perfect. The violence might seem a little excessive, but it is so over the top that you will not be able to turn away. Great dialogue that stays true to the source and mananged to get the crowd I saw it with to chuckle at least a dozen times (better than most comedies I have seen of late). All in all, if you are of the male gender and you have not made plans to see this film this weekend, please stop reading this review and get to your local theater pronto. Sin City is a place I will be visting a couple more times before it leaves the big screen.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Straying Too Far From Its Roots"></head><body><p>Often times when a hit TV show makes the jump to the big screen, that show loses one or more key elements of what makes the show a hit in the first place.  This was exactly the case with Star Trek: The Motion Picture.<br /><br />The core of Star Trek: The Original Series was its thought-provoking plots, spectacular action, subtle humor, and character developement.  This first motion picture only succeed in one of those areas.  Let's quickly examine each of those areas to see where this move succeeded and failed:<br /><br />Plot: The plot of this movie is a very well-defined script that (without spoiling anything) produces an incredible surprise ending that very few viewers likely saw coming.  Essentially, the Enterprise is sent to investigate a strange cloud-like phenomena that is wreaking havoc on the galaxies.  While invesigating, they find that the phenomena is more intimately linked to themselves than they could possibly imagine.<br /><br />Action: While this film contains some spectacular special effects, it ultimately is bogged down by long, and rather boring, periods of pure dialogue.  Though some people are amazed by the endless panning shots of the "new" U.S.S. Enterprise, I found it to be way too overdone.<br /><br />Humor: This aspect that was so popular in the Original Series is severely lacking in this first film.  The entire movie has a very serious tone that does not include much witty banter or light moments.<br /><br />Character Developement: In my mind, the ultimate success of the entire Star Trek franchise hinges on the notion of character developement.  By using an ensemble cast, the Original Series was able to develop their auxiliary characters (albeit not as much as they should have!) into important members of the show.  This movie, however, focuses too much on "foreign" characters (those not seen in the TV show).<br /><br />To conclude, while Star Trek: The Motion Picture featured a thought-provoking plot that harkened back to the days of the Original Series, it also strayed too far from the core of that show to be considered a classic film.  Even the drab grey/white uniforms conveyed a serious, non-fun feel to the entire picture.  If you want to get acclimated to the Star Trek universe, do not start your quest with this film (instead, skip to the second movie).  However, if you could care less about the cannon of the show and want to watch a thought-provoking sci-fi film, than you will likely enjoy most aspects of this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Friday the 13th, Part 3  (1982)"></head><body><p>Director:  Steve Miner<br /><br />Cast:  Dana Kimmell, Paul Kratka, Richard Brooker, Nick Savage, Rachel Howard, David Katims, Larry Zerner, Tracie Savage, Jeffrey Rogers.<br /><br />Running Time:  93 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for extreme gore and violence, language, and sexual situations.<br /><br />Jason has survived the massacre from "Friday the 13th, Part 2" and continues on his way, butchering two more people in a truck stop diner. This doesn't stop a new group of friends from going to the lake for a good ol' weekend of sex and relation. While their, two of them, Shelly (Larry Zerner) and Chris (Dana Kimmell) leave the lake to go buy supplies, and run afoul of a local biker gang. Shelly nearly destroys the leader's (Nick Savage) bike, and they vow payback on the kids. While sabotaging their van, two of them get killed by Jason, who the kids don't know is there. With Chris and boyfriend Rick (Paul Kratka) enjoying a talk in the woods, they begin to suspect foul play when their car dies out. Shelly ends up scaring a girl he likes, Vera (Catherine Parks) who sends him away. He goes into the barn, where he thinks Chuck (David Katims) and Chili (Rachel Howard) are, but runs into Jason. Jason goes back and kills Vera, then goes into the cabin were the kids are 'sleeping' and kills two more, leaving only Chuck, Chili, Chris and Rick; no one aware of Jason's presence. Jason now launches an all-out assault on the camp, leaving only Chris and Rick, leading to a solo fight against the killer.<br /><br />Director Steve Miner returns to the helm for his second sequel in a row, both does not pull through as he did with "Part 2"; his inability to build up any good scares or shocks as well as the fact that he takes too long to get the movie going. His direction hasn't improved much at all and he's certainly not helping himself by not trying anything new or different in this film. There are a few memorable death scenes, particularly one guy who gets slashed in half when he's walking around on his hands, but these moments aren't built up to particularly well, there's no sense of dread and almost no suspense; what little of it is there is mainly because of Harry Manfredini's very effective and creepy Ennio Morricone-esque score.  The gore effects are in more abundance than in the previous two films, but they still look rather cheesy sometimes.  The film is actually saved by a very riveting, exciting finale, in which all the cliches are used, such as the car that (in)conveniently runs out of gas, the dead body in the closet, the killer who's really not dead, etc., but Steve Miner actually handles the entire sequence quite well.  Overall, a sequel with much to be desired; however, at least it created a Halloween icon with its first usage of the famed hockey mask.  The first two films were much better.</p></body></html>

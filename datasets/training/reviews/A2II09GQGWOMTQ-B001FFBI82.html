<meta name="summary" content="Good movie but could have been better."></head><body><p>I'll get right to it.<br /><br />The good?<br />Great acting, pacing, score, cinematography.<br />The movie was fun to watch and I honestly don't think I've heard the "F" word uttered this many times since Rob Zombie's Halloween movies.<br /><br />The bad?<br />Kind of like The Hurt Locker I have a hard time believing that our troops really act like this in real life.<br />Why does Hollywood insist on vilifying our troops?<br /><br />If you (Hollywood) have a problem with our involvement in the Middle East then please take it up with our politicians.<br /><br />Do I recommend Jarhead?<br />......not really.<br />If your looking for a movie that's just a tad more realistic than Hurt Locker than sure, rent it.<br />Otherwise I'd rather watch a documentary any day over this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Funniest SF in a long time"></head><body><p>First, the basics: Bruce Willis pretty much ensures a good action flick, so this is really a SF-action-comedy. Effects are good, even judging a `97 film by `04 standards. Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) has babe appeal, which the film uses nicely without overusing it. And, in case anyone was wondering, the Earth is saved. As usual.<br /><br />After that, the movie offers a few unique points of visual styling. The most remarkable one was that white stripey thing Leeloo wears for the first part of her role. It keeps us in suspense, eagerly awaiting a Janet Jackson event that never occurs. That's ordinary enough - what's remarkable is that the outfit is a friendly knock-off of one used in a 1970s performance-art video, Rebecca Horn's "Einhorn." Well, if you're going to swipe an idea, swipe the best.<br /><br />There are two wonderful action sequences, fast cuts back and forth between two concurrent but unrelated scenes. One alternates between a spaceship takeoff and a Ru-Paul-eque Ruby Dee giving a toe-curling moment to a stewardess. The other switches between Leeloo punching up some bad guys and an abstract dance performance. Both cases give some heavy handed but enjoyable visual puns connecting the parallel scenes.<br /><br />So where does the comedy come in? Everywhere. It starts with benificent aliens - they look like buzzard beaked jukeboxes with glow-in-the-dark codpieces. Goofy bits continue to the last scene, where the president would congratulate our hero and heroine, except that they're already rewarding each other with - well, with each other.<br /><br />This is just fun. There's no big lesson, there's no social or scientific plausibility. There is good visual presentation, good action, and a few chuckles. Lord knows I've seen worse.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great action movie; but did not deserve a Best Picture nomination"></head><body><p>Movies about aliens on earth have been popular going back to the black & white days, so it is really hard to come up with something new and original.  There have been several that were noteworthy.  Maybe the first was the original War of the Worlds, followed by The Day the Earth Stood Still, in which we encounter the god-like aliens who come not to destroy, enslave or uplift mankind, but to discipline us.  Spielberg released the next two milestones.  Close Encounters of the Third Kind was probably the first movie to really explore how individuals, communities, and governments would react to the appearance of UFO's.  E.T. personalized the encounter and put a friendly, if not humanoid face on the otherwordly visitors.  Both movies also featured the most memorable soundtracks of alien movies.  After this, special effects and CGI become widespread and Hollywood is annually producing at least one expensive, though not always profitable, movie about aliens landing on earth.  Examples include Independence Day, Starship Troopers, X-files, Starman, Predator, Superman (remember, he is from Krypton), etc..  However, after E.T., none of them has ever earned a major nomination from the Acadamy Awards until District 9.<br /><br />Produced as an indie film, and set in South Africa of all places, District 9 is probably the best alien invasion movie this decade.  All the norms of alien films are turned upside down; the aliens are technologically advanced, but not advanced enough to keep themselves out a slum.  And instead of having smooth skins with nice uni-color suits; they look like prawns.  And they love catfood.  And instead of coming to Earth as visitors, conquerors or predators, they got stuck here, either lost or as refugees.  This is the backstory of District 9.  The main plot is about a bureaucrat who is accidentally exposed to some sort of biowarfare agent, and begins to transform into an alien.  As this occurs, he is hunted down by humans who want his body for various reasons.<br /><br />This movie is superficially a sci-fi action flick, but it also has scenes of tragedy, comedy, suspense, and drama.  In short, it is a complete movie that explores the human condition in many aspects.  I however did not think it deserved a best picture nomination from the Acadamy Awards as there were too many plot holes in it.  Many of these are highlighted in other reviews for this movie, so I will list the most visible ones.  First of, why isn't the area below the spaceship evacuated?  Second, the aliens clearly own superior technology in terms of military hardware.  Why don't they use this hardware to free themselves from their slum?  Third, how did Wikus and his alien friend, Christopher, manage to escape District 9 and navigate to the MNU corporate headquarters without anyone noticing them?  Fourth, why did Wikus not see a doctor after being exposed to the black liquid.  He knows he is sick, especially after his fingernails start coming of.<br /><br />So overall a good movie, but not a great one.  But as an indie movie, it was probably the best indie movie of 2009.  For its low budget, the special effects, cinematography, set design, costume design, basically everything technical, is spot on and up to par with any big budget Hollywood flick.  This is telling, and highlights how expensive big name actors and actresses are, and how their salaries tend to comprise the biggest chunk of big movie costs.  Worth the watch, and buying this DVD.</p></body></html>

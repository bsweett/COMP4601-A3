<meta name="summary" content="very intense Movie"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood truly made a Great film that dealt with so many topics&themes. Hillary Swank did a great job as did Morgan FreeMan.the film is very touching&it touches on many aspects of Family Life. it centers around the Boxing Ring,but it goes beyond that. this was far&away the best overall film that I saw last year&It really hits home.</p></body></html>

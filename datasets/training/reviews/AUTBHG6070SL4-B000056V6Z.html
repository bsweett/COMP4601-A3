That's enough for any teenage boy (or for anyone who once was a teenage boy). Mostly, the pretty women do stuff with their clothes on, which should keep mothers of teenage boys reasonably happy.<p>The action is good, the fights are nicely choreographed, the wire-work is outstanding, and the effects don't take over from the very capable actresses. The plot won't be an intellectual challenge for anyone over about age nine, but that's fine. <p>It's just an action movie with pretty women. That's all. If that sounds good, you'll love it. If not, you probably wouldn't have read this far.</p></body></html>

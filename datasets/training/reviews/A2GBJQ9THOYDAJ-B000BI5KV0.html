<meta name="summary" content="Good photography, gooey script"></head><body><p>Fifty years ago, a "nature film" like this would have been made by Disney; I certainly saw a bunch of those as a kid. Nowadays, it's National Geographic. And as a story of fascinating natural processes, it's a pretty good film. The photography is absolutely gorgeous, and you'll find yourself shivering just watching the blowing snow. But I object strenuously to the filmmakers' romanticization and anthropomorphization of their subject, even though the story naturally includes death and predation. But c'mon: "Love"? "Loyalty"? "Heroism"? Balderdash! Instinct and natural selection! (*sigh*) Actually, there's another piece of nearly the same length on the DVD that theatergoers didn't see -- "Of Penguins and Men," sort of a documentary about the making of the documentary -- which features a voiceover by the French cameraman in the understated style of Jacques Cousteau (and whom I found preferable to Morgan Freeman's rather bored narration). Personally, I think it was better than the feature film.</p></body></html>

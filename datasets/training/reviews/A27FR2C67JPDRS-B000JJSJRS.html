<meta name="summary" content="Mummy Mia!!"></head><body><p>Brendan Fraser and Co. are back for a second round with that nasty mummy with twice the adventure, special effects and even a 10 year old son for the two lead characters.  While this sequel is lacking some of the charm of the first film, it is still a satisfying &quot;summer&quot; action film that you can sit back with a tub of popcorn and enjoy.  Wrestling star, The Rock, makes a cameo at the beginning of the movie as the Scorpion King, a character whose story helps set the plot in motion.  Fans of the WWF star may be disappointed as he is only in the film for 5 minutes or so.  The dvd includes several extra features and any fan of the first film will more than likely enjoy this one too.  Good film for a boring afternoon or to see with a group of friends.</p></body></html>

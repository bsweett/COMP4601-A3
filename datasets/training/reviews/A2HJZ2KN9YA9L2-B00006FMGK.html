They could be purely cerebral sci-fi stories like The Motion Picture, intergalactic mystery thrillers like Star Trek VI, or even outright comedy, like Star Trek IV.  They often quoted great works of literature knowledgably, touched upon current events and even featured wry comments on American history ( "On Vulcan we have a saying: Only Nixon could go to China.")  They were intelligent movies made for an intelligent audience.  They presumed that the audience had read Dickens, Shakespeare, D.H. Lawrence, Arthur Conan Doyle, Melville and others.  <p>The rankings of the characters also changed and the introduced new ones.  The movies with the original cast did things which took real risk with the characters.  Kirk was an Admiral for the first four movies, Chekov was not serving on Enterprise at the beginning of Star Trek II, and Sulu was Captain of Excelsior in Star Trek VI and never set foot on Enterprise.  This is in addition to killing off Spock, blowing up the Enterprise, spending one full feature flying around in a stolen Klingon vessel (until the last scene) and finally retiring the crew.  They did not exist simply to have space battles.  In point of fact some of the movies managed to get by with few or no space battles.  The original series and much of the Next Generation had similar standards of quality.  <p>The Next Generation movies, in contrast, have been little more than extended episodes of varying quality.  No new recurring characters have been introduced and you can always count on seeing the original cast back on the bridge.  A great opportuninty for development was lost in Insurrection.  How cool it would have been to have Picard decide to retire on the planet right then and give Riker a field promotion to captain. Nemesis attempts to give us some development, unfortuneately it involves the death of a character at the climax whose potential for resurrection is made extremely obvious.  When Spock died in Star Trek II it was a moment of Tragedy which left me feeling cathartic, as well as extremely excited about Star Trek III which would be released in 2 long years. When a character died in Nemesis I felt like they were just imitating without understanding. I never had any feeling of loss or suspense.  Just a strong sense that I had seen it all before.<p>This may be the worst of the Trek films as it is little more than an extended space battle.  It was made by people who seem to have only seen the previous movies, found themselves most engaged by Star Trek II, and decided to repeat it.  These sequences have become so routine that, with a little more humor, I could compare it to elements of a James Bond movie.  <p>In terms of topical discussions, it touches lightly on the theme of Cloning, just with a tad bit more seriousness than Star Wars Episode II.  <p>Continuity is effected in terms of the rest of the series which makes me wonder if perhaps the film should be regarded as non-canonical, like the novels and, according to some, Star Trek V and the excellent animated series.  Perhaps in the next movie Picard or Riker or Data will wake up and all of this will have been a bad dream.</p></body></html>

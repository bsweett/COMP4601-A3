<meta name="summary" content="Omen III: The Final Conflict (1981)"></head><body><p>THE OMEN was released to a wide audience in 1976 and it stood as one of the greatest horror films since THE EXORCIST. But THE OMEN was just a warning of what was yet to come. DAMIEN: OMEN II was released in 1978, where Damien had the reached the age of 12 and fulfilled his Prophecy. But in 1981, OMEN III: THE FINAL CONFLICT was released to a wide audience. This sceond sequel, although not the last, is absolutely amazing and is one step better than DAMIEN: OMEN II.<br /><br />  DAMIEN THORN (played by the brilliant Sam Niell) is now 32 years old and is running THORN INDUSTRIES, has been since the death Richard Thorn, Damien's uncle, who had been running it, since Robert Thorn's death. The death of Britain's current Ambassador has allowed the President of the U.S. to point the position U.S. Ambassador to none other than...Damien. The posistion had once belonged to his father and now, Damien is in the game.<br /><br />  Over the course of the next few weeks, Damien has to thwart out the assassination attempt on his life that is planned by seven monks from Italy, who have possession of the seven daggers. With this in his hands, Damien also has to deal with the second coming of...JESUS CHRIST.<br /><br />  In order to stop the Christ Child, whom Damien calls the Nazerean, Damien orders his disciples to kill every male infant that was born on March 24th of the year taking place. Damien begins an affair with British Television interviewer, KATE REYNOLDS (played by Lisa Harrow), but with the help of a priest named FATHER DeCARLO (played by Rossano Brazzi), Kate finds that Damien is the true Antichrist and he is readying to reign his command on earth after destroying the Christ Child.<br /><br />  With the seventh dagger (since Damien has killed all the monk-assassins and taken the first six daggers), Kate stabs Damien, where he sees the apparition of Christ himself and then dies. Damien, after 27 years of killing and bringing nothing but evil to this earth, is now dead. But do not think that all evil is down and out, for their is another sequel coming your way.<br /><br />  Although, DAMIEN: OMEN II was a great first sequel to its box-office smash of a predecessor, it was not as great as the first film. This second sequel right here, OMEN III: THE FINAL CONFLICT, was just as great as the first film, making up for what the second film did not quite make out to be. Sam Niell is the first major well-known actor to play Damien and he did one hell of a job. Sam Niell, in my opinion, was always a great actor, but he proved that to be 100% true with this role. OMEN III: THE FINAL CONFLICT (although, not final) is waiting you to whip out your credit cards and awaiting to be added to you OMEN collection.</p></body></html>

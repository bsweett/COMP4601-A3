<meta name="summary" content="An incredibly beautiful animation and very touching and funny story"></head><body><p>Both me and my 6 years old daughter we loved this movie - although of course for different reasons.<br /><br />She appreciated the very idea of talking cars and then the races, Mator the "red-neck" car, etc. I was impressed by the animation - this is for the moment the most technically advanced animation movie I ever saw ("Happy Feet" did as well) - and the more adult oriented humouristic parts (a Porsche girl who left Los Angeles to find peace in a small town; an old town doctor, called Doctor in Internal Combustion; the cars going to the toilet - guess which line is advancing faster..., a rivalry between a "Peace and Love" old van and a retired sergeant who is of course a jeep, a Japanese female journalist who is a gorgeous little Honda, etc, etc.).<br /><br />The final scenes in which they show fragments of older Pixar movies (like Sully and Mike Wazowski stranded in Himalayas) played by cars (the Yeti being an enormous snow tractor) are a delight. I just can not uderstand some of very critical (and mean) reviews below - I loved this movie and, more important, my daughter loved it too. She insisted on sleeping on a pillow with Ligthning McQueen for months after that...<br /><br />If you didn't see it - go and get it.</p></body></html>

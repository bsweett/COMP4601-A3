<meta name="summary" content="a classic hybrid worth owning!"></head><body><p>With the exception of Michael Jackson's "Thriller", this is the greatest work director John Landis ever produced. This comedy/horror hybrid is fast paced, brief and to the point. Alternating between producing genuine frightening moments and real eroticism (the use of Van Morrison's "Moondance" during a steamy sex scene is sheer genius) while allowing subversive imagery (the Jewish in-jokes are really a Jungian buffet of dark humor), and genuine organic laughs, Landis (WEREWOLF being unlike the rest of his work) uncannily finds a way to create a lusciously loaded and layered film with economy and precision.<br /><br />Much has been written about the Rick Baker special effects and they are truly stunning and there isn't a hint of CGI to be found. The famous transformation scene is the best of the werewolf sub-genre as it is well-lit and performed with Sam Cooke's golden throat silking through "Blue Moon" on the soundtrack.<br /><br />The leads are capable, likable and evoke empathy- a rare feet for a contemporary horror film. Jenny Agutter, one of films great underappreciated  female leads, lends her usual strong, sensual support.<br /><br />Celebrating the classic horror film while also gently spoofing it, Landis creates a contemporary horror/comedy classic hybrid that improves with each successive viewing.</p></body></html>

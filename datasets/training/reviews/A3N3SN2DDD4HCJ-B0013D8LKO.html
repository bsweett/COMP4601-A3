I have always much preferred Kubrick's films for the look and composition more than the ideas, from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; to &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; it's more the style than story. But here he was actually saying something. &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; explores the dark corners of a relationship, principally of marriage. It exposes the worries lovers have when they deal with trust and faithfulness. Kubrick brilliantly paints an effective and disturbing picture here. The character in the beginning who tries to seduce the Nicole Kidman character at a party reeks with evil poison and Kubrick just shows us the idea, he knows we're smart enough to figure it out. The performances are also superb. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are excellent, which is an achievement because as a married couple, this must have been a difficult movie at times because of the feelings and emotions it raises. &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is a fitting finale for Kubrick. The orgy sequence is brilliant because it is not meant to turn you on, it's creepy, darkly atmospheric and Dantenean. I only wish a better ending had been filmed. It just resolves too quickly and simply with a little naughty word. Still, this is a good movie, dark, but sharp and intelligent and very complex. I was surprised because Kubrick, as I said, is more about style. He usually doesn't present philosophical genius mingled with brilliant visuales like Oliver Stone. But here there is something that speaks into the hearts of relationships. It shows why Kubrick is one of the lasting giants of filmmaking.</p></body></html>

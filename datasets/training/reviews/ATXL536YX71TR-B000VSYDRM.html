<meta name="summary" content="Lingers long after the closing credits"></head><body><p>From the moment this film opens the viewer is propelled into the most unusual and exciting/disgusting/disturbing/exhilarating sensual trip that a movie can offer! This is film-making at it's best.Sadly,many people will not be able,for one reason or another,to appreciate the complexity of PERFUME.I know of no other attempt to tackle such unique subject matter.Perhaps this is why this film so amazed me.It is refreshing to see NEW material,and not some rehash of the same stuff over and over again.<br /><br />PERFUME is a film that lingers in the mind and in the senses LONG after the closing credits.The finest perfume does just that.<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY A ONE-OF-A-KIND MOVIE.This one goes in my collection for sure.</p></body></html>

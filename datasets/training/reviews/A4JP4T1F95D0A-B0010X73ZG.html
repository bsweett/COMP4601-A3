It had been many years since I had picked it up, so I wanted to refresh my memory.  After watching the movie I can say that the director stayed fairly true to the source material.  Little things here and there are fiddled with, but the King story is basically brought to the screen the way the author wrote it.  The biggest change is the ending.  Where the author left a rather ambiguous ending, the director gave a very definitive and dark ending that reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode with the astronauts in the desert.  All in all it is a pretty faithful adaptation to the story.  As far as Stephen King movies go, this is a winner.</p></body></html>

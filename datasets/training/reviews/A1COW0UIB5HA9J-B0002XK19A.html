<meta name="summary" content="Even better then the original!"></head><body><p>2 years after the first movie, Peter Parker (Tobey Mcguire)has never had time for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) whom has became a model/actress or for class because sometimes there's always crime happening sometimes at the wrong time as he must try to win MJ's heart.  But when his powers suddenly fad he decides to give up being Spider-Man for good, however as Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molan) who has made a robot suit with monstrous tentacles somehow gets involved in a accident that makes the suit attached to him with his mind telepathically controlling it to become Dr. Octopus. Life seems good for Peter ever since he's giving up being Spider-Man and that his powers were gone, as now there's more crime especially involving Dr. Octopus whom has a plan on elimating the city! can Peter Parker's powers return or will the city be doomed?<br /><br />This is a rare sequel that can be better then the original like say "Terminator 2", "Aliens", "Dawn of the Dead", "Godfather II", "Superman 2" or "Empire Strikes Back"! Sam Raimi and company knew what they were accomplishing when they made this fantastic sequel to the instant classic "Spider-Man" but with more emotion, more action, better special effects and some comical moments. J.K. Simmons along with Bruce Campbell, Rosemary Harris and James Franco return as well, the performances are nothing but terrific and it's even more true to the comic book then the original movie.<br /><br />This 2-Disc set has excellent quality sound and picture with awesome extras like a 12-part documentary showing from movie pre-production to the premiere, two featurettes, four web-episode featuettes, music video, trailers, blooper reel, two audio commentaries, trvia-track with pop-up facts, Multi-angel behind the scenes of the climatic pier sequence, art gallery, and weblinks.<br /><br />A must have and must see!</p></body></html>

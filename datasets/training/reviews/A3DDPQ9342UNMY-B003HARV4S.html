<meta name="summary" content="Impressive magic show...nothing is what it seems..."></head><body><p>THE ILLUSIONIST is a satisfying magic show, but not quite up to the standards I expected. One factor that was especially disappointing: any discerning viewer could easily see what the final plot twist would be long before the secret is revealed. Still, it has a certain fascination for any fan of mystery and suspense, or Gothic detective stories involving the supernatural.<br /><br />EDWARD NORTON is Eisenheim, the magician who fascinates audiences with his clever sleight of hand and amazing tricks that seem to indicate he can bring to life dead spirits.<br /><br />PAUL GIAMATTI is effective as Inspector Uhl who doggedly determines to find out just what's going on behind the illusions, as much to placate his own need to know as it is to satisfy Crown Prince Leopold (RUFUS SEWELL) who has an agenda of his own for wanting the illusionist thrown into prison. It seems that his fianc&eacute; (JESSICA BIEL) has been a childhood sweetheart of the magician.<br /><br />Rufus Sewell gives the film's strongest performance as Crown Prince Leopold, with Norton appearing a bit uneasy in the pivotal role of the man behind the illusions.<br /><br />The film's biggest flaw is the last portion of the story, which has the inspector putting the pieces of the puzzle together as a last minute fix for the story's conclusion. It doesn't strike a truthful chord since the solution is much too intricate to be solved by fleeting fragments of the inspector's mind reviewing past events. It bears comparison to another recent film, THE PRESTIGE, which handled the same sort of material in an even more striking way.<br /><br />Summing up: Interesting, lots of atmosphere, beautifully photographed to capture the period with an appropriate background score by Paul Glass that is effective in setting the mood perfectly.</p></body></html>

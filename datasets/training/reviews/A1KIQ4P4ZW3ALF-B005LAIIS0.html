<meta name="summary" content="Short Story not Short Enough"></head><body><p>Movie is based on a short story which doomed it from the start because we know how much research and effort goes into a short story. A good story takes years to write and rewrite and involves a lot of research. Not in this case. Too many holes not well thought out for a reality based story. I, like many others, bought the movie because of Liam and his face is prominent on the cover. Should have been a wolf - at least you would get to see one.<br />Problems:<br />(1.) The initial scenes of a a bunch of guys drinking and brawling seemed too much like Hollywood script writers copying an old western saloon.<br />(2.) Liam's suicide thoughts were just a distraction and out of place.<br />(3.) The plane crash sequence, which was imaginatively created from the passengers pov turned out to be just cheap filming as all we're shown is a subsequent scene of a partial plane and stuff strewn on snow. And the usual couple of burning fires.<br />(4.) The drunken cowboy stereotypes as survivors continue which under the circumstances didn't seem to fit workers accustomed to working in those difficult conditions.<br />(5.) Usual dumb decisions like not fashioning snow shoes (easy to do from plastic suitcases and webbing; not making weapons from aluminum as defense against predators; not making torches; not gathering more than one lighter; not punching more holes in fuel tanks for kerosene; not using powder from bullets for small explosives; not making aluminum trekking poles. Basically not good planning while not searching for survival materials.<br />(6.) The shotgun shells on sticks seemed to have gotten lost - not that it was explained that well in the first place.<br />(7.) Final scenes of not fashioning a crutch or carrier for the leg injured survivor; being submerged in freezing water and when Liam gets out he's not shivering or hypothermic. Should have been dead, if not while in the water, then soon afterwards.<br />(8.) Not trying to find a path down a small cliff - the wolves seemed to have had no problems.<br />(9.) The behavior and pursuit by the wolves was way over the top - thought I was watching "Twilight". Their brief momentary cameos in scenes and even the artificially reflective eyes was just cheap cinematography.<br />(9.) River they were following was large to begin with but got progressively smaller. Huh? That's a good trick.</p></body></html>

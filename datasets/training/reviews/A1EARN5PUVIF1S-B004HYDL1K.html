<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie, So-So DVD"></head><body><p>This is a nifty B movie with an amazing cast, but the shortage of extras on the DVD might merit waiting until a better edition is released at some point in the future.<br /><br />NO director's commentary... NO making of featurette.  Just an actual audience response soundtrack option and a few deleted scenes running less than ten minutes.<br /><br />Machete may not text, but he sure deserves better than this bargain-bin release.  Of course, the DVD is from Fox, so why would anyone expect anything better from a Rupert Murdoch company?<br /><br />I hope Robert Rodriguez of all people finds a better distributor for his films in the future...</p></body></html>

Then I see one of his good movies, and the late eighties come flooding back. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, despite its awkward title (and how strange is it that this is the sixth movie to carry that title?), is definitely one of those.<br /><br />Downey plays Harry Lockhart, a small-time crook who stumbles into the beginnings of an acting career while fleeing from some nasty men with guns. Lockhart is transplanted to the other side of the country and under consideration for the lead in a detective series; in order to get him some ideas about what happens on the job, he gets paired up with real private detective Perry (Val Kilmer). Meanwhile, he's run into Harmony (Unfaithful's Michelle Monaghan), the girl he had a major crush on in high school who went out to Hollywood to become an actress. Perry is planning on keeping Harry out of danger, but the two of them quickly become embroiled in an ugly, complex case.<br /><br />I don't watch too many comedies; not because I don't like them, but because I prefer other genres of film. So I don't laugh terribly much when watching movies. This month, though, I've laughed more at movies than I have in the past year. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was half the reason. (He Died with a Felafel in His Hand was the other half.) Kilmer and Downey are great foils for one another, and both have very good timing here. Add in a few overly weird minor characters and the mother of all Rube Goldbergian plots, and you've got yourself a winner. No one will mistake this for deathless cinema, but then again, it never aspires to be. *** ?</p></body></html>

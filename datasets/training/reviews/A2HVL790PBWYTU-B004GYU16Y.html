<meta name="summary" content="the truth of Evelyn Salt"></head><body><p>Evelyn Salt isn't your fancy, high-kicking heroine. She does whatever it takes to get the job done. She doesn't give an ef about style points. In combat, her application of Muay Thai and Krav Maga allows her to dispose of her opponents directly and viciously and often permanently. Evelyn Salt is a highly skilled, highly lethal CIA operative. When she's set up and fingered as a Russian sleeper agent, her immediate concern is for her husband's safety. Evelyn Salt goes on the lam, and so re-enforces the accusation placed against her. The CIA goes on the warpath. But so does Evelyn Salt.<br /><br />Decades out of relevance, the Cold War strikes again. Somewhere, John Le Carr&eacute; and Robert Ludlum are smiling. SALT is an engrossing espionage thriller and so twisty it had me half-convinced that I'm a Russian mole. It's not long before you start questioning Evelyn Salt's every move. Who is Evelyn Salt? What's her true agenda? Where is her allegiance? You don't learn for certain until deep into the film, when Salt is put in a position to prevent a nuclear holocaust... or trigger it.<br /><br />This is old hat for Angelina Jolie. Her mojo is such that she carries the film effortlessly. I'm not even that surprised to learn that SALT, in its early stages, intended to feature Tom Cruise as "Evan Salt." Jolie belongs to an elite club. She's one of those very few actresses who is sexy, can act, and do some serious buttkicking. Off the top of my head, there are Jolie, Yeoh, Jovovich, Hamilton, and Weaver - and all have presence. Jolie has great acting chops. She commits to her role, not only tonally, but physically. Although, fine, I don't think she quite pulls off her disguise as a Russian officer. Still, it's an impressive sight watching a seriously pisssed Salt embark on a killing spree. Let me say, though, that it's just really wrong how, from the back seat of a speeding car, a captive Salt remote controls the cop driver thru rampant application of her taser (and yet I couldn't stop laughing). And like Yeoh and Jovovich, Jolie relishes performing her own stunts, so she's no wilting lily. Speaking of stunts, the most spectacular one involves Salt's various insane leaps onto the roofs of various trucks criss-crossing on the freeways. My jaw got all agape.<br /><br />Don't mean to dis the menfolk. Liev Schreiber lends gravitas as Salt's CIA friend and colleague who reluctantly joins in the (wo)man hunt. Dude is a good actor and makes a good foil for Jolie. Meanwhile, Chiwetel Ejiofor - playing a by-the-books government agent - becomes the Tommy Lee Jones to Jolie's Harrison Ford. SALT is more action-packed than it is cerebral. More BOURNE IDENTITY than THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. And with the cliffhanger ending positioning SALT to be another film franchise for Jolie, it looks like Tom Cruise made a booboo opting out.</p></body></html>

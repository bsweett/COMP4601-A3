Lolita to name a few. Then there are some films that are so legendary, so iconic, that to even suggest remaking them verges on sacrilege.The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, Scarface, Citizen Kane, etc. I'd put the original Superman in this group. I think there are roles that certain actors were born to play, that they completely and positively own, that are them and, to this moviephile, Christopher Reeves didn't play Superman, he WAS and still IS Superman and any 3D cgi reincarnation of the role is doomed to invite comparisons to Reeves and will fall miserably short.<br /><br />For anyone whose been in a coma the past 30 or so years, the film lays out the origin of the son of Krypton, his escape from his own dying planet to Earth where he's raised by his adoptive parents as Clark Kent, his awakening to his powers and his destiny, and his role conflict expressed through his infatuation of a female colleague at the Daily Planet, Lois Lane, and his greater responsibility to protect the human race. Reeves perfectly embodies the contradiction of his two personas. As Clark Kent, reporter at the Daily Planet, he's modest, unassuming, weak (he needs glasses to see properly), and he, like everyone else, envies his alter ego who's the complete opposite. But even so, when you see Clark, the wholesome farmboy who sends half his check to his elderly mother, you see Superman and vise versa. Clark embodies what all of us, who've been blessed with superior abilities should be like: humble, generous, deflecting praise, using our powers to help others--Reeves embodied this principle and wasn't just another pretty boy with muscles. I don't think anyone else has or can pull off the Man of Steel with the same charisma and charm and life Reeves channeled into this character. When the Dark Knight dropped, I jumped the gun like everyone else and said that it was the best superhero movie ever made. But then I remembered this wonderful magical film and its star Reeves, Margot Kidder (hang in there, babe), Gene Hackman, John William's rousing score, and I quickly revised my ranking of the Dark Knight: it is the 3rd best superhero film ever made. This film, Superman, and its sequel, are the best Superhero films ever made thanks to a man who was even more of a Superman in real life. Rip, Chris.</p></body></html>

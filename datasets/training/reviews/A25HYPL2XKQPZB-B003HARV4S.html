<meta name="summary" content="Visually stunning, great score, poor acting, slow plot"></head><body><p>While watching THE ILLUSIONIST, I couldn't help but compare it to another movie that came out in the fall of 2006, THE PRESTIGE. Both films featured magicians at the turn of the century. Both are amazing to watch, the cinematography takes you to another world. The acting is top notch in THE PRESTIGE, but in the ILLUSIONIST, Edward Norton as the great Eisenhiem, seems very wooden and his accent is also annoying.<br /><br />THE PRESTIGE featured plot twists after plot twists, the movie constantly shifted and left you feeling confused at the end. THE ILLUSIONIST moves slowly, taking its time to tell its story of love. Eisenhiem and Sophie (Jessica Beil) knew each other as children, but because they were from different social classes, they could never be together. Eisenheim returns after a 15 year absence and finds Sophie is soon to be engaged to the future emperor of Austria, the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell.)<br /><br />Leopold doesn't want the two to be together and a confrontation ensues. Paul Giamatti plays the police inspector who has a lot to gain by shutting Eisenhiem down, but knows what an evil person Sewell's character can be. While THE PRESTIGE is a complex movie that focuses on magic and the extent magic and deception can be used to manipulate lives, THE ILLUSIONIST is really a love story with magic only coming into play occasionally.<br /><br />The Illusionist tells a simple story with a twist at the end. The twist didn't shock me, I saw it coming. It was believable and made the monotonous hour and a half before it that much more enjoyable. This is a good movie to rent, but one you won't really want to watch more than once, so I don't recommend buying it.</p></body></html>

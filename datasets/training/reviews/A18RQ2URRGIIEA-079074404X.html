'Doc' Ostrow (Warren Stevens) of the United Planets Cruiser C-57-D after it arrived at the planet Altair IV. The C-57-D, commanded by Commander John F. Adams (Leslie Nielsen), was sent to Altair IV from Earth to rescue a colony sent there two decades earlier on the spaceship Belleraphon because all contact was lost shortly thereafter.  When the C-57-D arrived at Altair IV, they received a warning from philologist Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pigeon) that they should not land.  He also claimed to be the lone survivor of the doomed Belleraphon.  However, Commander Adams had his orders and the C-57-D landed on Altair IV in spite of Dr. Morbius' objections.  After landing, Dr. Morbius and his robotic companion Robby (Robot the Robot) greeted the C-57-D crew, but Dr. Morbius continued to insist that they should leave immediately.  Unexpectedly, a beautiful woman, Altaira (Anne Francis), appears.  She is Dr. Morbius' daughter, whom he had ordered not to be seen while the C-57-D crew was on the surface.  The crew is delighted to meet Altaira, who have not seen a woman for 378 days while en route to Altair IV, but they were also surprised because she was not listed on the Belleraphon's passenger manifest.  Dr. Morbius explained that he was married by the Belleraphon captain, but that his wife died on the planet shortly after giving birth to Altaira.<p>Altaira was not the only thing that Dr. Morbius planned to hide from the spaceship visiting from Earth: he also had no intention of revealing Altair IV's biggest secret, but Commander Adams and Doc Ostrow forced the issue.  Reluctantly, Dr. Morbius explained that a race far more intellectually and techonologically advance than mankind, the Krell, once inhabited Altair IV.  Sadly, for hitherto unknown reasons, the Krell became extinct virtually over night as well as all other life on the planet 200,000 years earlier; but not all of the Krell's secrets had been lost.  As foretold by Dr. Morbius, strange things begin to happen to the visiting spaceship and crew similar to what ultimately destroyed the Belleraphon; and the isolated peace that Dr. Morbius and Altaira knew on the dead planet before the spaceship's arrival evaporates.<p>Taking inspiration from William Shakespeare's play &quot;The Tempest&quot;, writers Irving Block and Allen Adler created a brilliant story for &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.  The Duke Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot; became Dr. Morbius, his daughter Miranda became Altaira, the enslaved spirit Ariel became Robby the Robot, Ferdinand became Commander Adams, the island of exile became the planet Altair IV and Caliban became a monster bent on destruction.<p>Under the direction of Fred M. Wilcox, the acting, dialog and special effects for &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; greatly surpasses nearly all other sci-fi films produced in the 1950's and 1960's.  Having been twice previously nominated for Best Actor in 1942 for &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; and in 1943 for &quot;Madame Curie&quot;, Walter Pigeon's portrayal of Dr. Morbius was exceptional.  &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; received a 1956 Oscar nomination for Best Special Effects, but lost to the only other nominated film, Cecil B. DeMille's &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;.  It was not until Stanley Kubrick filmed &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; in 1968 that a sci-fi film surpassed &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; in quality and achievement.  The few films comparable to &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; from the 1950's include &quot;The Day The Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951) and &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; (1953).<p>Time has not caused &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; to lose any of its excellence. Sci-fi fans more accustomed to modern computer-enhanced special effects may regard the effects used in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; to be dated, but most will more than likely come to appreciate what Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was able to achieve with 1950's film technology.  For example, some may be surprised to see that George Lucas (in his 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;) was not the first to show what a holographic image could look like, as demonstrated in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.  Some may also be surprised to see Leslie Nielsen portray a serious character, instead of his more recent, bumbling comedic characters in films such as &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; (1988).  Overall, I give &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; a highly deserved 5 out of 5 stars, as it will always be a timeless, landmark sci-fi film warning us to always beware of monsters from the id!</p></body></html>

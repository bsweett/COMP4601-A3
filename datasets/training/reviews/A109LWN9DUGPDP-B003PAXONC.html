<meta name="summary" content="Blu ray Ultimate Collector's Edition"></head><body><p>The first time I viewed this movie was the theatrical version and thought it was a good film with a disappointing climax.Once I seen the uncut version that is included in this package I thought it was a great movie all around.This Blu Ray Ultimate Collector's Edition is incredibly packaged its the best collectors edition dvd or blu ray I own and I have more than a few.The original blu ray release packed both versions of the film on one dual layer 50-BD disc,in this release each version is on separate disc with 1080p/VC-1 encode which does improve video quality on both versions.You also get a digital copy all three disc are in one nice package within the very large box that everything else is in.Some of the other things included is a 44 page concept sketch book,6 art cards that shows city's devastated by the plague and also a pretty cool holographic lenticular of a few seconds of the film.Im not gonna sit here and say this film is great enough to have such a royal treatment but in my opinion it is a really good film and this new packaging is just top notch A+ better than anything I have seen.So if your a fan of the movie or like nice collectors editions or cool packaging or looking for a gift for someone who has or will have a blu ray player soon this is a great choice.The price is way,way worth the packaging.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Shook the world in 1962"></head><body><p>You have to be of a certain age to remember that this film was supposed to premiere on network television in 1963. That premiere was withdrawn, however, after the relative of an elected official was kidnapped right before the film was supposed to air.<br /><br />This should tell you a lot about the era and intelligence about mental illness that existed when this film came out. Everyone thought anyone that was mentally ill was going to run around killing people. That is exactly what happened in the movie. Today, we know better, I hope.<br /><br />Still, if you've never seen it, buy, rent or tune into Turner Classic Films the next time this film airs for a wallop you'll never forget. The mental illness storyline is hackneyed and out of date by new millennium standards, but this remains Hitchcock's greatest psychological masterpiece.</p></body></html>

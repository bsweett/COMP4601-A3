<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant, Inteligent Film"></head><body><p>I was blown away by this film the first time that I watched it. Never before had I seen such a compellingly written crime story that becomes something more: a series of psychological mind games - the film itself becomes an entity, daring you to make preconceptions of any kind, daunting you with plot twists, strangling you with suspense, until the final card has been played and the only thought that comes into mind is <p>wow<p>It is a film where nothing is as it seems, and trying to find what is real is like a dog chasing after its tail. The story, so much as can be told, is that a ship caught on fire outside San Pedro, California, and only two people survived: a Hungarian with burns covering over half of his body and Roger "Verbal" Kint, a cripple from New York. The events are told via flashback, Kint describing how he hooked up with hardened criminals such as Michael McManus, Todd Hockney, Fenster, and his friend Dean Keaton, an ex-cop and ex-con just wanting to play it straight. As the story unfolds, the men have to serve the will of the diabolical Keyser Soze, and the power of the film grows until the end, when we realize that the Keyser (and Chris McQuarrie) have played us for fools.<p>This is not a movie for everyone. If in a crime story you need somebody getting whacked every minute and guns and explosives constantly, you might be a bit bored. Sure, there are all those things, but the emphasis of the movie is on its story and most of the film is dialogue. If you resent having your mind challenged and messed with, please do not apply. If you do not want to pay close attention to every scene to try to find out what's happening, some of the enjoyment might be lost. However, the beauty of The Usual Suspects is that nearly every loose end is tied up, except for one: What happened to Keyser Soze?<p>Excellent camerawork and sound help one get into the film. But more compelling is the acting. Gabriel Byrne is phlegmatic and charismatic as Keaton, a man wanting to change but tormented by the Establishment (Keyser) and by inner demons. Stephen Baldwin plays the macho McManus, and he is utterly convincing in the role. Benicio Del Toro, in one of his earlier performances, turns the rather insignificant role of Fenster into a captivating performance, he goes over the deep end, but it works perfectly. Kevin Pollak plays Hockney, a pyrotechnic who is worried about himself only. Pollak gives a fine performance and his natural comic timing adds some levity to the plot. Kevin Spacey gives his most complex and mesmerizing role as Verbal, whose brilliance is in that he seems boring and ordinary, when, in fact, he is not. Chazz Palmintieri plays his character with both sensitivity and toughness, and pulls it off brilliantly.<p>The extensive extras include deleted scenes (none of which really add anything to the story) a gag reel (the Keyser Soze rap song was hilarious) extensive documentaries and comentaries. Although they go through the processes of making an independent film, the director and screenwriter offer only a few insights into their craft. Alas, the film speaks louder than they could.<p>This film is genius, pure and simple. It is one of those "questioning reality" movies without the laws of physics being broken and machines trying to kill humanity off. This comes highly recommended.</p></body></html>

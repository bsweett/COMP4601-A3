<meta name="summary" content="Sometimes Funny, Sometimes Brilliant, But Mostly Confused."></head><body><p>I first learned of the character of Borat this past summer from a friend of mine who introduced me to DA ALI G SHOW.  I found the sketches that I watched to be rather intriguing and at time quite humorous.  Sacha Baron Cohen's portrayal of the faux-Kazakhstanian journalist reminded me of another comedian that I greatly admired, Andy Kaufman.  Cohen's Borat most resembles Kaufman's Latka Gravas.  However, Borat is a far more crude and rude type of character than Latka ever was.<br /><br />The movie is "filmed" in a grainy, mockumentary style.  According to the plot of the film, Borat has been sent to America by the Kazakhstan government to observe the people in the United States and bring back what he learns so that the lives of the Kazakhstan people can be improved by the knowledge he brings back.  Borat and his comrade, Azamat Bagato (Ken Davitian) begin their journey in New York City.  Actually, they are supposed to stay in New York, but after Borat views an episode of Baywatch on television, he decides he has to go to California to find Pamela Anderson and marry her.  Thus begins a cross-country excursion that takes Borat through Georgia and Texas and eventually California.  Along the way, Borat stays at a bed & breakfast operated by an elderly Jewish couple, buys a black bear as a guard pet, befriends a prostitute, causes havoc at a local television station, scares children, and offends lots of people.<br /><br />There are moments when the movie is hilarious and there are other times when the film is quite insightful and becomes an almost brilliant dark satire into the American subconscious.  However, more often than not, BORAT (the movie not the character) is so pretentious that it is comes off as being a boring travelogue.  There are some very funny bits that occur (the chicken on the subway made me chuckle and I couldn't help but laugh when Borat was able to stand his ground against a group of feminists).  There are also some times when the movie shows part of the bigotry that many people in America have, such as when Borat asks a gun owner about which gun is best to kill a Jew, when Borat is talking with an older cowman before a rodeo, and when Borat goes on a drinking spree with some college students.  There are people in the United States who still harbor great hatred towards people of different races and religions.  But, we already knew that, didn't we.  In that sense, BORAT fails as a satire because it doesn't show the audience anything new that we didn't know and it doesn't offer any real suggestions in curing those problems.<br /><br />There are many moments in BORAT that are intended to be funny and illustrate how backward American people are, but instead of doing that the film illustrates just how kind and giving American people tend to be.  While lost in a "rough" area of Atlanta, Georgia Borat is befriended by a group of young black men (of course this is later used to show how racist certain hotel people are).  While eating dinner at the home of a genteel Southern family, the hosts go out of their way to accommodate Borat and make him feel welcome; they go far and above what people would consider acceptable, but they are good and kind people.  In a scene that is meant to be funny, Borat is embraced by a Pentecostal church--despite what one might believe about their religious practices, the people at the church embrace Borat.  Even the group of drunken college students, who spout various racist comments, befriend Borat and seek to comfort him during a trying time.<br /><br />There are also some moments in the movie that are intended to be funny, but have no humour value whatsoever.  For instance, there is a scene where Borat and Azamat get into an argument and begin wrestling naked in their hotel room.  The wrestling match continues throughout the hotel and into the stage of a conference room of the hotel where a dinner is being held.  Apparently, two naked men wrestling with each other in various sexually-suggestive positions is supposed to be laugh-out-loud hilarious.  I just didn't get it.  It was unnecessary and served no value whatsoever.<br /><br />Having seen some of the Borat skits from THE ALI G SHOW, having been intrigued by the preview for BORAT, and having heard so much of the hype, I was disappointed by BORAT the movie.  It wasn't the laugh-out-loud comedy I thought it was going to be and neither was it the full-blown dark satire I had heard that it was.  The film contains elements of both, but the movie doesn't live up to the hype.  The film most resembles a SNL movie, but the grainy film style makes it more entertaining than most of those.  Many high school and college students will love this film, but unless you're in those crowds are work with them, you probably won't find BORAT very entertaining at all.</p></body></html>

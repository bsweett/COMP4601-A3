<meta name="summary" content="Excellent and thought provoking."></head><body><p>This movie has amazing depth and resonated with me on many levels. Will Smith's performance is excellent. The film is well done, drew me in and held my interest to the end.<br />Chris' struggle is as real as it gets. His perseverance and fortitude in spite of grueling life trials, is inspiring. It's also a testament to the power of a child's love and trust and the importance of keeping family together.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this film, and for family viewing.</p></body></html>

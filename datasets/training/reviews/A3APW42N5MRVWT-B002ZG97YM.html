This is a fine movie well worth seeing in 2D; even more so in 3D because there is some very good animation that takes advantage of 3D without distracting from the story by being done just to say "Hey, we're in 3D". The movie starts out looking like it will be just your average Dreamworks animated throwaway but keeps building the world and the characters and the story rapidly surpassing our expectations and then just continues getting better right to the end.</p></body></html>

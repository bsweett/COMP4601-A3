In pop culture terms, Hannibal Lector has, of course, become the modern incarnation of implacable evil.  Not only do his cannibalistic acts represent the ultimate in human moral debasement and degradation, but his seeming indestructibility makes him all that much more horrifying.  His escape at the end of the first film served as a perfect setup for this sequel, as we find Lector living a life of seeming &#8220;normalcy&#8221; in Florence, Italy, just waiting for the proper moment to come out of &#8220;retirement.&#8221;  That moment arrives when Clarice Starling, the FBI agent who helped to save Hannibal&#8217;s last victim, is suddenly in the news again after an abortive and disastrous attempt to arrest a major criminal ends in the death of a number of her fellow officers.  Lector begins communicating with Clarice again, vowing to restart the game of intellectual cat-and-mouse he so enjoyed in the previous film.<p>For most of its running time, &#8220;Hannibal&#8221; is a pretty enticing thriller.  Anthony Hopkins repeats the brilliant work he did in &#8220;Lambs,&#8221; making this most evil of movie villains both chillingly unreachable and bizarrely compelling.  With his clipped diction and often-incisive glimpses into the dark truths of the human psyche, he keeps the audience as emotionally off-balance as he does Clarice herself.  Indeed, we understand why she is both repelled and strangely attracted to this man.  Julianne Moore, who replaces Jody Foster in the role she originated ten years ago, brings an impressive reticence and hesitancy to this woman caught between her moral dictates and her desire to know more about the evil she is confronting.  In fact, apart from this explanation, many of her actions later in the film would be inexplicable unless we were to consider her utterly incompetent at her job.  My suspicion is that the filmmakers have something deeper in mind.  In addition, writers David Mamet and Steven Zaillan have created an interesting subplot involving Giancarlo Giannini as an Italian detective who uncovers Hannibal&#8217;s identity and thinks he can outsmart the devilish mastermind, capture him, turn him over to the authorities and make a fortune by collecting the reward money.  Giannini perfectly captures the subtle nuances that define this extraordinarily complex character, a man made up of many different, even conflicting moods and motives.<p>So far, so good.  But then - inevitably perhaps with material of this nature - the filmmakers cannot resist going overboard into downright incredibility and gruesomeness as the film approaches its denouement.  Even those familiar beforehand with the tenor of this story may well be appalled by some of the turns the film takes in its latter stages.  In the past, one used to encounter scenes like these only in low budget exploitation films like &#8220;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.&#8221;  Now they are being fed &#8211; pardon the pun &#8211; to mass audiences in the guise of slickly marketed &#8220;entertainment.&#8221;  Poor Ray Liotta &#8211; I will never be able to look at him from here on out without seeing him in the condition he ultimately ends up in at the close of this film.  It is an image too indelible to ever be completely forgotten and goes well beyond the pale even for a film on this nasty a subject area. Moreover, whereas the first film ended on a note of clever, albeit macabre black humor, &#8220;Hannibal&#8221; closes with a scene that is simply sickening in its unbridled grotesquerie.  <p>Of course, complaining about the level of gruesomeness in a film about a serial cannibal may smack one as a bit of a Pollyanish stance for a knowledgeable viewer to take.  Still, the first two-thirds of the film, in which the writers and director exercise an admirable amount of restraint, prove that this material can be even more effective when it is dealt with through indirection than when it is all laid out for us in such grisly, graphic detail.  There is much to recommend &#8220;Hannibal,&#8221; but unless you have a cast iron stomach and a very short memory span, you may well want to skip out before the final curtain is finally wrung down on the scene.  That is if you ever want to eat again.</p></body></html>

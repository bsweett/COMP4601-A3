<meta name="summary" content="Romance, comedy, loose ends."></head><body><p>This is an ensemble film with romance, comedy, and loose ends. I'll start off with the negatives.  There are simply too many stories going on at once to make a complete film.  There were plenty of moments when I was wondering what happened next in another sub-plot, side-story, whatever.  Also, there were a few scenes where I was shaking my head.  Then I realized that this is a movie, so I let it slide.  One such moment comes when a 10-year-old boy is running through the airport looking for his one true love, and he is being chased by at least 4 security guards.  At one point the guards are apparently running at top speed (a mere 4mph--excuse me, this is England--try 10kph) with the child blazing ahead of them at a jog.  I know, I know, it's a movie!  But scenes like that that made the film falter.  As for the positives, and there are a lot here, the ensemble acting is refreshing and very well done.  Two performances stood out for me.  Emma Thompson, as usual, is excellent, showing once more her wide range of emotions and able to spin around and change direction on a dime(okay, a schilling).  The other great performance here comes from Laura Linney, and her situation is truly heartbreaking.  She finds love, but circumstances and timing just don't allow the great possibilities to unfold.  I wanted to give her a hug.  There are many other, fairly believable scenarios between other characters, some of which take a turn toward Hollywood sensationalism.  But overall, the emotions, and the universal need to be loved is present in nearly every frame of this film.  As for that aspect, this film is remarkable.  There are many humorous situations, a few emotionally difficult character moments, but the end result is one of hope.  As I said before, there are simply too many plots going on for a complete film to be possible, leaving many frayed and/or loose ends like, &quot;What ever happened to that character?&quot;  But that alone should be dully noted.  Why would I have cared about those characters if they hadn't been rendered so convincingly?  There are some over-the-top Hollywood moments, but they are forgivable because the heart of this film is in the right place.  Thank you.</p></body></html>

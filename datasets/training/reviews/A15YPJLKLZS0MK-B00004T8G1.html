<meta name="summary" content="John Carpenter"></head><body><p>100 years ago a ship wrecked under fog. The dead mariners return from the grave for revenge. A priest saves(?) them at the end. A pretty good rental flick, and the best horror film I've seen in awhile. I would recommend it to see once or twice, and for those curious as to John Carpenter's non- Halloween work as a film maker, this is a fine film, but not the all time classic Halloween is.</p></body></html>

I was living with 6 people in a crazy apt in Manhattan during 2000. We were all film students, but never went to the movies, were too busy I guess forgetting what it was to be alive. I dont remember a trailer for this, no idea who Vin Diesel was randomly picked this up on a friends advice because he said it was (more or less) an extension to Charlie Sheen's 'The Arrival'<br /><br />I wish I had seen this in theaters. Just epic sci fi. Characters that were easily enjoyable, that you cared about, the switching of the boy/girl thing was very well done, the story had me hanging on from jump street. There is so much here, a combo of a little Dune and The Descent, the lighting was really good even in the dark scenes and I was hooked baby, just really stellar stuff. The scene of the ringed Saturn type planet eclipsing the planet as they drove by, was so magical. The dude from Platoon, (interestingly with Charlie Sheen), as the Imam was a good mix of balance. The scene when the flying smaller bat things, went down the long hole and you can peer in to see all the bones from the scientist there that locked themselves in and forget their was an opening 22 years earlier or whatever, man just so well done. There are touches of so many memories from other films that remind me a bit of this, like I said: Dune, The Cave (still thought it was cool), The Descent, Duncan Jones Moon, hahha dunno, all just came to mind.<br /><br />What Vin lacks in his acting ability, he makes up for with a pretty decent ensemble cast, that just takes the film along the way where you never lose interest and really are on the edge of your seat. Dig in.<br /><br />I love how a film can be lost for years from your sight, and then something like this comes along that you overlooked and it can turn your whole world onto a series like Riddick, hoping that Vin will step away from the $$$ that is Fast and Furious for a bit, and concentrate on his favorite character for perhaps another two Riddick fliks with David Twowy.<br /><br />Just so much fun!</p></body></html>

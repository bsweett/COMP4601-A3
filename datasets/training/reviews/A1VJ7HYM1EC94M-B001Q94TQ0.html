<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely Shattering"></head><body><p>Maria Full of Grace deserves all of the accolades being heaped on it - and then some.<br /><br />This is a powerfully moving film with a stunning first appearance by Catalina Sandrino Moreno.  Her Maria is definitely full of grace, and guts as well as hope and promise.  Her story is a harrowing one and it's told without a note of false sentiment giving almost a documentary feel throughout that makes the tale all the more real.<br /><br />Every frame captures the horror of a teenage girl wanting only to better her life, getting involved in a something bigger than herself (and hopefully one shot deal), being stranded and lost in a foreign country and legitimately fearing for her life.  Ms. Moreno won several international awards for her performance and earned every one.<br /><br />A stunning achievement and a beautiful, if harrowing film.</p></body></html>

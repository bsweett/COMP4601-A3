<meta name="summary" content="The Two Titans of 80s Terror Face Off!"></head><body><p>And what a battle it is.  Freddy is stuck in Hell, forgotten by the Elm Street families he terrorized, so he sends Jason off to stir up some dust and some memories.  The Camp Crystal Lake killer does his job, but doesn't stop while ahead.  This turn of events angers Krueger to no end, and gives his potential victims an edge.  Place your bets.<p>Freddy Vs. Jason has been in development for nearly ten years (perhaps longer), ever since New Line bought up the rights for the Friday the 13th series from Paramount.  For fans of either series, it should prove well worth the wait.  Not surprisingly, the movie resembles an entry in the Elm Street series more so a Friday the 13th sequel.  This is probably due to the fact that the Elm Street series had a more inventive visual style than the pedestrian Friday the 13th.  But the characters play off each other quite well, and the remaking of Jason into a more 'sympathetic' killer works well within the concept of this sequel.  Director Ronny Yo has done his homework, fans of either series will be more than happy with this 80s era monster smackdown.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

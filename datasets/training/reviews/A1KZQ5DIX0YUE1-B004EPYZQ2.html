<meta name="summary" content="Super 8 Rates a 10"></head><body><p>I didn't even know that Super 8 was a 'monster movie' or 'alien movie'. I just knew it was a new J.J. Abrams project. Since I am a fan, mostly because I am a fan, I made it to my viewing with little outside bias.<br /><br />I'd rate the film at four stars, but the effects and extra footage included with this BD are quite enough to gently push this to push this film forward into the five-star shelf in my film library. Much like Star Trek, the cinematography and scoring are amazing. Much like Cloverfield, an amazing design of monster hits the screen like no other. But if you are in the viewing for this as a monster/kid-friendly movie, you've got an awesome bid you're looking towards. I say 'kid' with some variance of course, meaning those of age comparable to the actors, but I know some parents would disagree. The kids swear a fair amount, but it's nothing too terrible. And the clincher - the on-screen violence is very minimal. And that's rare enough in movies nowadays. But many parents will doubtless think of films such as E.T., the Explorers, Flight of the Navigator, et al. And should be more than enough to get the whole family to sit down as pass the popcorn.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Irritable Harry and the Seeds of Rebellion."></head><body><p>"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" adopts a menacing tone as the Voldemort spreads his influence over the wizarding world. After Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and cousin Dudley are attacked by dementors, the life-sucking creatures that guard Azkaban prison, Harry is whisked away to the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, a secret organization sworn to combat the forces of the Dark Lord. Soon he is back at Hogwarts School, having barely escaped expulsion for the underage use of magic in self-defense. But defamatory press against his allies and protectors, the insistence by well-meaning adults that Harry be kept in the dark about matters that most concern him, and a new insidious Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, Delores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), put Harry in a persistently foul mood. If that were not enough, Harry is plagued by visions of Voldemort's scourge.<br /><br />The most fun in the Harry Potter movies is often found in the extravagant behavior of Hogwarts teachers, and "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" pulls another coup on that front. Megalomania has never been so entertaining as when coupled with Delores Umbridge's sweetness and pastels. The film doesn't make light of the dire situation suffered by students and staff. Umbridge's spying and prying at Hogwarts is a thinly veiled Inquisition. Her efforts to stamp out individualism through Draconian policies are condemned as products of fear and egotism. A stark message made more than palatable by Imelda Staunton's gift for caricature. Evanna Lynch gives an especially charming performance among the students, as the eccentric, spacey Luna Lovegood. A new set, the interior of the Ministry of Magic is eye-catching but too CGI for my taste. The movie isn't as brooding as the book, but a shadow is unmistakably spreading over the wizarding world.</p></body></html>

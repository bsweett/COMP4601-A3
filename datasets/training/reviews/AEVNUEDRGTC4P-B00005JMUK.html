<meta name="summary" content="Anti-Feminist Movie"></head><body><p>Monster is a remarkable movie and not just for the obvious artistic reasons.  For one thing, it shows just how degrading lesbianism is.  More importantly, it goes against the feminist position that women should only be portrayed as being victims, not criminals in their own right.  In feminist movies, there are no such things as femme fatales.  All women are depicted as being helpless victims at the hands of evil males.<br /><br />Monster reminds us that there are evil women, such as Aileen Wuornos, who are capable of the most fiendish things, including violence against men.  For this reason alone, Monster is a most remarkable movie that completely goes against the feminist grain.</p></body></html>

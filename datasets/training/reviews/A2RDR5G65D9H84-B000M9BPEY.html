<meta name="summary" content="&quot;We are storytellers, both of us&quot;"></head><body><p>When I watched the trailer for this movie I was left with mixed feelings, on one side I wanted to see it just because it was directed by Tim Burton, but on the other side, what I saw seemed too fantastic for my liking. Luckily, my wife was desperate to watch this film, so I was &quot;forced&quot; into watching it soon after the date of its release in DVD. I say luckily because the story is mesmerizing and the fantastic elements are fun and add a certain charisma to the film.<p>Will (Billy Crudup) is tired of listening to his father tell stories over and over and being the center of attention in every gathering. When at Will's wedding, Edward (Albert Finney/Ewan Mc Gregor) repeats his annoying behavior by retelling the story for the nth time of how he caught a big fish, Will gets extremely angry and they get into a confrontation. This leads to three years of silence between father and son, which is only broken when Edward gets seriously ill and the doctors have no hope left for him. <p>Will goes back with his parents' house and we get immersed into the different stories Edward told through the years, from a witch that showed him how he was going to die, to the time when he started growing extremely fast and had to spend three years in bed as a result. As the stories pile up, the son finally starts to understand who his father is and to appreciate that which has bothered him for so long.<p>Tim Burton leads us through a labyrinth of myths and legends, with skillful storytelling and scenes that will make even the toughest of you feel emotional and maybe drop a tear or two. It is definitely I movie I recommend everyone to watch!</p></body></html>

However, there are some that have worked for me; KING KONG, THE FLY, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, even the current WAR OF THE WORLDS.  The reason primarily is that they were genuinely REMADE with the current times.<br /><br />CANDIDATE retains the basic premise of mind conditioning and Raymond Shaw's rather twisted relationship with his mother.  The film starts in 1991 Iraq and follows through to the post-terrorism paranoia of today.  There are many other changes in the story as compared to the original film, which, like it or not, is what remaking a movie is all about.  If not, you end up with an inferior carbon copy of an original, like Gus Van Sant's PSYCHO (what the hell was that idiot smoking when he came up with that idea???).</p></body></html>

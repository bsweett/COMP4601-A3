When a dealer (Lawremce Fishburne) is jailed just in New Year's eve and a stormy weather gets worst, the bus in which is transported leads the hazardous prisoners to 13th Precinct. But there are obscured clouds around. A corrupt policeman (Gabriel Byrne) will do his best to eliminate the dealer and masked behind the law will try to take by assault the named precinct no matter how the prize be.<br /><br />Some spectacular sequences and a kinetic rhythm confers to this thriller major scope</p></body></html>

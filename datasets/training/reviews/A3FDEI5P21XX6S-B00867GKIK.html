<meta name="summary" content="An outstanding Blu...4 discs filled with more than a day's watch"></head><body><p>I had no expectations of being disappointed with a Disney/Pixar BD, and being that it took me a whole dedicated day to get through everything, I now feel it was worth every penny. The film was enjoyable, funny, sad, and scary filled with some nice messages about life and loss. I can understand why the majority of my customers loved it.<br /><br />The Blu clarity is outstanding, and the amount of reference points are extensive, but one that stands out the most for contrast lines would have to be when the house is entering the lair (balloons against the dark cavern). The sound is selectable between 5.1 DTS, 2.0 DTS and Descriptive English. The 5.1 was beautiful with tons of reference points, sometimes excruciating (that bird screeching) but thorough nonetheless. Now for the supplements (all times in minutes):<br /><br />DISC 1: (BD)<br />* 5:46 Partly Cloudy short film. Was hilarious. A great depth test for your display with the clouds. Nice little message of tolerance no matter how difficult someone might be.<br />* 4:40 Dug's Mission. An almost lo-def looking short take on our main dog dealing with the main three baddies on a chase.<br />* 22:17 Adventure Out There. A must see documentary about the crew taking the actual trip to the Tepui location in South America. A beautiful travel infomercial in itself. Loved how their guide only wore sandles for the ascent and hikes.<br />* 4:56 Alternate Scenes Ending of Muntz. Sketches and interviews regarding different endings for that bad guy that they had come up with.<br />* 1:00 How-to on using the Digital Copy.<br />* Cine Explore option while watching the film. The two directors give their commentary with multiple pop-up screens showing art, ideas, etc.<br />* Screen Saver. Allows you to set a time period for your screen saver to activate.<br />* Maximize Your Home Theater. The standard Pixar multi-step process for setting all of your theater capabilities.<br /><br />DISC 2: (BD)<br />Documentaries<br />* 6:24 Geriatric Hero. History behind the creation of our old guy. All of these documentaries are interview oriented with sketches and film clips to supplement.<br />* 8:26 Canine Companions. In depth analysis on the breed choices, training and dog behavior studied to get the dogs in the film to be more - dog like.<br />* 9:00 Russel Wild Explorer. Covers the reasons for his character to have the loss and why he was "egg" shaped as opposed to other sketch ideas.<br />* 5:04 Kevin (bird). Nice reference to the Swiss Family Robinson ostrich; covered the hardest part of any of these animation films - the feathers.<br />* 4:38 Homemakers Pixar. Enjoyed the work that went into them studying sub-floors and lighting options in making this look so real in the house.<br />* 6:25 Balloons and Flight. Tells the now famous number of balloons used; some interesting dirigible history; shows the Pixar group using that local Bay Area air service I keep seeing fly around here (research stuff).<br />* 7:37 Composing for Characters. Have to be into the musical/scoring stuff for this one.<br /><br />Extras<br />* Global Guardian Badge Game. After the initial setup of name, difficulty levels and tutorial material, the game has an extensive amount of country/geography material. Customers grouped around and we did fine for the United States section, but we randomly tried Africa and we bombed (some of the countries they were asking for I hadn't heard of in years) - good learning tool though.<br />* 9:15 Alternate Scene - Married Life. Another sketch/interview piece about more material being removed/added into that section of the film. The scene itself would have been only a minute longer.<br />* 6:00 montage. A mix of characters doing funny things - will make the kids laugh.<br />* Screen Saver option.<br /><br />DISC 3 (DVD)<br />* Film, plus special features from disc 1. WITH THE EXCEPTION of no Spanish subtitles/language; English only.<br /><br />DISC 4 (Digital Copy).<br />* Code both unlocks the copy and gets you the usual points at the Disney site.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent product no matter how you look at it. The case has that new single hinge, multi-page off center chassis that has proven to be less than durable, but it should suffice for low usage storage. Enjoy.</p></body></html>

Fascinating."></head><body><p>Quentin Tarentino made his mark with this well-executed, finely-textured and magnificently fascinating movie featuring an all-star cast. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames ignite the screen in this action-packed, character-driven, multi-layered story. John Travolta proves he's still got the moves in a dance scene with Uma Thurman. This movie is much better than "Jackie Brown," a misfire with me, but Tarentino got back on track with "Kill Bill." He should act more in his own movies. The movie should not have been rated R, but PG-13 for some violence and mild language.</p></body></html>

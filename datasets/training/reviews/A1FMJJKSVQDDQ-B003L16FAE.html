Here we are introduced to the "Predator," an alien hunter who has crash-landed in the jungles of Central America. Little is known about this strange species; only that it'll kick your @** if you get in his way. Add in Arnold Schwarzenegger and his team of soldiers and you've got a bitter conflict between human and alien. I got to say that this is one of the few movies in which Arnold gives a very good performance. You get to see him in some well-done action sequences. The supporting cast is good as well: who would have thought that Jesse Ventura could act? The action is solid; the blood and gore aren't very excessive, but they're still tons to see. And of course, the "Predator" is the real star in this film; that, and the special effects (which still looks realistic today).</p></body></html>

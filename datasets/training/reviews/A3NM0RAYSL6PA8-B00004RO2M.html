Masterfully controlling the cinematography of Full Metal Jacket, he rendered every image is a work of art, searing them into the conscious and subconscious mind. And seeing it in high definition is a wonder. To be sure, there are better transfers, but mostly on subpar films (trash like Stargate). This version of Full Metal Jacket is crisp and clear; the soundtrack is amazing.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, it's impressionistic -- a series of vignettes held together by characters we first meet in bootcamp. It leaves a powerful, lasting impression of the horror, irrationality, and, ultimately, the pure humanity of war. We are killing machines and lovers, passionate friends and brutal thugs. And, in killing and fighting, we sometimes find ourselves most alive.<br /><br />There are amazingly poignant lines in this film that resonate powerfully in terms our current war in Iraq. They don't support one side or another, but merely reflect on the universality of war and on America's invervention in places where the locals might not entirely appreciate our efforts and sacrifices. Reasonable human beings can differ on what is going on in Iraq, just as they could about Vietnam. Full Metal Jacket really isn't about that kind of debate. Rather, it turns the spotlight on how much war is a part of us -- and we a part of it.</p></body></html>

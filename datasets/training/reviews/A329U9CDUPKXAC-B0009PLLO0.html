<meta name="summary" content="It was alright"></head><body><p>Alexander was very....long. It was good but a bit too long if you ask me. I'm pretty weak when it comes to Greek history so trying to follow all of what was going on was impossible for me. The movie zips along and if you get a little lost you're totally lost. So I just sat there and enjoyed what I could.<br /><br />The acting was very good. Angelina Jolie is BEAUTIFUL!!! Colin Farrel does a great job acting although I don't buy him as her son.<br /><br />The audience in the theater I was in was like a bunch of 12 year olds in sex ed class where they giggle every time somebody says the word [...]. Nobody said [...] in Alexander but there is a scene between him and his best friend Jared Leto and it's rather romantic. There's no kissing. In fact they don't kiss at all. Jared Leto is the love of Colin Farrel's life and all they do is hug throughout the entire movie. Colin Farrel does kiss a guy (briefly) but it's done in a joking way. Anyway, in the scene with Jared Leto the audience reverted back to kindergarten and they couldn't control their urge to giggle at the queer boys.<br /><br />The way the director handled Alexander's relationship with... whatever his name is..., Jared Leto,  was really disappointing. Alexander marries this [....] who you can't help but hate and there's a whole sex scene there. But the person Alexander truly loves just gets a hug every now and then. Even towards the end where Jared Leto is dying there is no show of affection.<br /><br />So this movie is really crappy if you're looking for a love story. Alexander goes kiss his mother though. That was pretty hot.<br /><br />Other than that, Angelina Jolie is fantastic, although they could have used her more, and the cinematography is beautiful! They story is too hard to follow though. I'd give it 3 out of 5 stars. Not worth the price of a ticket.</p></body></html>

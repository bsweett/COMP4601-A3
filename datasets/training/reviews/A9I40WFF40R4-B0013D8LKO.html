<meta name="summary" content="Not Kubrick's Best But Still Worth Seeing"></head><body><p>I have seen this movie three times and am happy to say it has grown on me. I'm still not sure I understand the movie but perhaps I'm not supposed to. There are unanswered questions when the movie ends, at least for me. It's certainly about the subconscious, sexual fantasy, dreams, reality, etc. I'm not sure Kidman and Cruise, though both beautiful and easy on the eyes, were the best choice for the lead actors. They appear to be playing themselves. I notice that a lot of people thought there was too much nudity. There's plenty of that, at least female. My biggest complaint is that parts of the movie are tedious and dull;(the movie is too long) I'm thinking in particular of the scene where Kidman and Cruise get stoned. High people are dull; these two are no exception.<p>The movie, however, is beautifully filmed. The scenery is lush and rich in detail, particularly the interior shots. There is great suspense here. The section of the movie at the masked "orgy" is brilliant and the best part of the movie. Parts of this movie will haunt you long after you see it.<p>This is not Kubrick's best movie; but even when he's not at his best, he's better than most other directors.</p></body></html>

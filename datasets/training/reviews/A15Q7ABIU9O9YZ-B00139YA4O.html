And the acting acumen that these (for the most part) young(er) actors bring to the fore may even be more difficult to present when you consider that they know that their appearances are going to be chopped up by . . . you guessed it, the sponsors. That's the nature of the beast. So say we see an early Jon Voight talking with his friend Lewis (Burt Reynolds) in "Deliverance." Voight's a 'woos' and Reynolds is so macho  that he makes you feel uncomfortable. BUT THAT'S THE WAY VOIGHT WILL BE IN 100 MINUTES. He knows it. The Director knows it. He can grow into the part over the course of an hour and a half. The actors on LOST have a lot of moments in the sun but they may be 30 and 40 minutes apart.<br /><br />And these actors look good. They are articulate, know their craft, and the women are sexy and yes, there's a lot of skin. When Jack is out on the makeshift driving range with Kate, she ain't Roseanne Barr; no offense meant. Even Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriquez) who is one tough, nasty person, even when she's busting someone's head or threatening to cap them, she just looks gorgeous.<br /><br />Additionally, the juxtopositioning of the then-current time-line with the past is brilliant. One of the reasons for this is because it reverse telegraphs what went on. Dr. Jack running stairs in one of the early scenes in the 'past' and pausing to commiserate with a stranger . . . whew. And the story of the Kims, Daniel and Yoon, and how they met, just excellent. A love story within the drama. It was like "The Notebook" without all the other sacharine.<br /><br />The writing is tight. The episodes are very well crafted. There is an urban legend that the production-management staff didn't count on the success and that while failure wasn't planned on it was considered. Hence the overwhelming success caught everyone especially the writers, off-guard. Here is a problem as I see it. We all have a certain half life we give to TV shows. Much as we love 24, for instance (I think still a 'smidgin' in front of LOST for sheer magnetic, breathless episodes), we know eventually Jack will have done everything possible in any human's imagination. He's been electrocuted, shot, addicted to heroin, and all the women he's slept with have been killed or left him. Time to move on. Ditto The Wire. So where do we go with LOST?<br /><br />One of the comments mentions a hubris with this staff of writers-producers-directors that they're great in the opening rounds but fade after the 8th. At the risk of using too much of a jock analogy, they have no bullpen. We'll have to wait and see. I haven't been bored yet for one episode in I (or II for that matter.)<br /><br />To go back to 24 and The Wire for a moment by analogy. We expect the year to produce one story. We expect the story, that story, to be completed in the 30 weeks alloted time.<br /><br />With LOST, it's a continuum and it will be curious to see where it goes. A lot of comments have been made about the show being Gilligan's Island with an edge. I would submit to you that those women aren't ANYTHING like Ginger and Maryanne. Great stuff for TV and coming at the end of a decade of truly worthless junk on television when we were all about to don the trappinigs of Peter Finch in Network and and say "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore" and hurl our TV's into the garbage. The recyclable bin, naturally. We're much more environmentally sensitive than Finch's character.<br /><br />But a quick word about Reality TV. Yeah. It's crap and my only hope is that Springer et. al. (the Judges' shows also) produces a thorozine calming effect on that portion of the public that is their audience. But . . .<br /><br />If you're giving props, check out the early shows of Survivor and Amazing Race. (granted, forget the spinoffs)). Are you kidding? This is where LOST emanates from. Stress. Conflict. Competition. Sex. Reward. Hardship. Bad weather. Bad characters. Come on. There are only 28 basic plots in storytelling. TV found a tangent. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

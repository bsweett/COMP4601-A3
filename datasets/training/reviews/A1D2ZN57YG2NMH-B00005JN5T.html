<meta name="summary" content="Not Even Close to "Meet the Parents""></head><body><p>Let me just say, I LOVE "Meet the Parents." It's one of my favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />Let me now say, this movie is NOTHING like meet the parents. The whole movie is based on two things:<br /><br />1. Cheesy Sex Humor<br />2. Gross out gags<br /><br />Nothing else from this film is memorable (except for the always amazing Robert De Niro reprising one of his best roles.) Gotta love Jack!<br /><br />Skip this movie, see the first one.</p></body></html>

I think bashing someone's brains in qualifies for "hurting" someone hehe. The most disgusting scene in this film was when he went up to the room where the woman who supposedly straggled danny was, and jack sees a beautiful naked woman in the bathtub, and she gets out and begins kissing him, and he suddenly felt that something was wrong and glances in the mirror to see what he was REALLY kissing and caressing, and it was an old women, who's body was deceased and rotting from the decomposition, and the water was all gross and her skin was falling off with huge brown patches of missing skin. And that horrible deranged laugh that was constant as she tried following him out of the room, kinda scary if you see this for the first time and don't expect it hehe. That scene makes me wanna hurl, and i think the movie the faculty copied that scene when the old woman walked into the shower room, and her skin was also loose rotting and gross, anyways lol. This film gets under your skin, no pun intended, and the parts when it showed the twin girls chopped up and bloody use to scare me as a kid. This was indeed a successful horror film, and many movies stole ideas from the shining, but werent successful anyway. I never get tired of this movie, jack nicholson is one of my favorite actors of all time.</p></body></html>

I don't think any one understands Catholic theology anymore, especially the priests. The movie spouted theology, angelology and eschatolgy, but it doesn't really match anything I know. The plot was hard to follow and had some hard to understand plot lines, but it made some pleasantly surprising turns too. The whole "spear of destiny" idea was very confusing. The characters were very interesting.  At the start, I thought Keanu miscast, but he grew on me. I enjoyed the point the Reeves's character made about believing in the devil. The heroine says, "I don't believe in the devil." Keanu replies, "That's too bad. He's believes in you." The truth is the truth no matter what you believe. It doesn't prove God or satan exists, but it is something to think about.<br /><br />It was fun for a spirtual thriller.</p></body></html>

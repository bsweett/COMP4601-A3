<meta name="summary" content="A Crucial Make Or Break For The Harry Potter Film Series (Part 5 of 8)"></head><body><p>When I first put down the fifth Harry Potter book I had told my friends that when the movie was made it was going to be amazing. 'Order of The Phoenix' was a real step up in the Harry Potter saga. A story that originated around magic spells and fairytales became a real world of war and politics. Harry Potter knew that this year at Hogwarts was going to be no different than the previous. Witnessing a fellow student die at the hands of his enemies the previous year things have gone from bad to worse. The Wizadering World has been torn between believers of the dark lords' return and those who just want to live in denial. Unfortunatly the second side is the side with all the power as the Ministry is trying to keep everyone in line including the children at Hogwarts. With a new teaching on the grounds insituting new rules to keep Harry's mouth shut, Harry and his friends are not going to take it lightly.<br /><br />This film was going to be a challenge for whomever took the directors chair. Small time director David Yates created a great film rich in the detail of the story. Eventhough a great amount of the books material was cut it was just like 'Goblet of Fire' There is a lot of pointless side story which really has no reference to the meat of the story and that is why you do not see those in the film. The characters have really come a long way acting wise. The children have really evolved since the begining and new commer Imelda Staunton nailed Umbridge. What David Yates did that was very different from the previous directors was that he made these characters real. With all the wizardry and magic there was a real sense of realisim through the diologue and the emotions expressed by the characters. Now with Yates signed on for the final 2 installments (3 technically due to the divison of Deathly Hallows) I am even more excited to see how the rest of this story emerges on to the big screen.</p></body></html>

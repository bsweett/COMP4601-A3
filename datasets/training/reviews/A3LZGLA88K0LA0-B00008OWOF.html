<meta name="summary" content="CRIME DOES PAY"></head><body><p>While watching this excellently made movie, I found myself wondering "How can we feel sorry for this character?  He's a pathological liar; how can we like someone who has stolen over 4 million dollars, and doesn't know how to live HIS life?"  In spite of Leonardo diCaprio's smooth performance, I didn't find myself feeling sorry for his character. Since this is based on a true story, other things became evident:  the ineptness of the FBI in the pursuit of this con artist; the gullibility of hundreds of people who could accept this baby-faced boy as a doctor, lawyer, co-pilot; Steven Spielberg still knows how to make a movie great even when it's subject matter isn't.  With that said, you should enjoy the capers of this brilliant young man as he goes from life to life and ultimately ends up becoming a millionaire by helping the government find others like himself.  Hmm..crime might pay?  Christopher Walken is very good in his Oscar nominated role as Leo's father, a con man in his own right; Jennifer Garner pops up in a brief role as a very high class hooker; Amy Adams is fine as Leo's love interest and almost bride; Martin Sheen shines as Amy's romantic father; and of course, two time Oscar winner Tom Hanks shows why he's one of the finest actors of our generation in his role as the fiercely determined, if somewhat ineffective, Carl Handratty.  John Williams contributes a somewhat Mancini-ish score that adds to the caprice of the film.  While I can't admire Frank Abagnale Jr.'s activities, the movie is a good example of cinematic artistry.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg's classic film in THREE different versions--1977 original, 1980 "Special Edition" and 2007 "Director's Cut""></head><body><p>Home video is quite a temptation for directors. It allows them to go back play with, alter, tamper and second guess themselves. We get three versions via seamless branching on Blu-ray on one disc with a disc of extras and the films presented with extras over three discs on DVD allowing us to see Spielberg's thoughts on "CE3K" over three different decades. The latest 30th Anniversary edition allows writer/director Steven Spielberg to fix flaws in "CE3K" that have bothered him for years about the film. The original theatrical version editing he felt was rushed and unfinished while the "Special Edition" deleted some key scenes and added a completely unnecessary trip inside the Mothership (something he later regretted). --he's edited it again (it's 2 minutes longer with some scenes lengthened and others shortened plus the trip inside the Mothership has been left to the audience's imagination). The "Director's Cut" works better than both versions; Spielberg has licked some of the pacing issues that dogged the original film and he has eliminated the gaudy trip inside the ship. For those fans who HAD to see the inside of the ship we still get that edition of the film which is a good thing--this is the most comprehensive version of "CE3K" released. This is the definitive version(s)of the film.<br /><br />Interestingly, Spielberg added the last section inside the ship so he could get the financing to re-edit the film for the 1980 re-release. It was a compromise he could live with at the time but he has since reversed that opinion wisely realizing that focus groups (Columbia's marketing department got focus group feedback asking to see the inside of the ship and that's where the decision to show the inside came from)can be idiots and cause damage to a film (see "Blade Runner" for an example of how it can compromise a film).<br /><br />The image quality is spectacular on Blu-ray and looks terrific on DVD as well. I have to give Spielberg credit; unlike, say, George Lucas, Spielberg presents his original vision with as much respect and care as he does his later revisions. You can pick and choose which version appeals to you--I liked the original version a lot in 1977, disliked the 1980 "Special Edition" and loved the "Director's Cut" of the film. What was subtle in the first version was blunt in the second and has been returned to subtle in the third version with better pacing and cuts that work better with the flow of the film. Fans of the film will love having all 3 versions so they can pick and choose which version they like.<br /><br />Audio sounds terrific as well with an active 5.1 mix presented in DTS and Dolby Digital Surround. The Blu-ray also features the sound presented in lossless uncompressed TrueHD Dolby. John Williams' soaring and uplifting score is beautifully rendered.<br /><br />The Blu-ray uses an interactive comparison feature "A View from Above" that has a pop up color/shape to tell you when there is a difference in a scene. It is color co-ordinated to which version has a difference and also to which version you are watching. It shows an image from the scene and explains what was altered. We also geta hard copy of that as well for both the Blu-ray and DVD with a "map" explaining the differences between the three versions and, on the other side, a reproduction of the original, effective poster (which also was used as a teaser trailer and is on the cover of the box)from 1977.<br /><br />There is also a storyboard to scene comparison section as well as conceptual art done by Ralph McQuarie (who also worked on "Star Wars" and "Alien" coming up with designs for various aliens and spaceships). Complimenting these sections on storyboards and artwork is a companion 30th anniversary scrapbook. We get brief biographies and backgrounds for the key players in the film and behind-the-scenes as well as comments from Spielberg about the project and behind-the-scenes photos.<br /><br />Ported over we get the extensive 1997 documentary on the making of the film as well as an interview with Spielberg from 2007 discussing his thoughts on the film, the changes he made and where the film fits for him now 30 years later as a film director. The original 1977 "Watch the Skies" featurette that played on TV as a promotional tie-in is included as well. A number of deleted scenes are also included. Finally we get the various theatrical trailers with the original teaser (that didn't show any scenes from the film but was compelling and artistic by itself) included as well.<br /><br />All of this is housed in a sturdy cardboard case for both the Blu-ray and DVD. This set is highly recommended on both DVD and Blu-ray since it houses the ultimate edition and allows viewers to pick the version of the film they enjoyed the most. It's also a way for Spielberg to have his cake and eat it, too.</p></body></html>

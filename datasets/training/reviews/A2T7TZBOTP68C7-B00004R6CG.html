<meta name="summary" content="Romantic Hitchcock"></head><body><p>Vertigo is a different Hitchcock movie than we have seen before.  Instead of a crime thriller like "Rope" or "Rear Window," Vertigo is a romantic, haunting mystery with a strong supernatural element, along the lines of "Laura." The screenplay was based on a French novel, "D'Entre Les Morts," or "From Among the Dead."  Vertigo is definitely the "chick flick" of Hitchcock's films.  It moves at a slow pace for the first three quarters of the film.  The sweeping shots of San Francisco Bay, the swelling romantic score, the lingering close-ups, and the love triangle would draw most women in and make some men bored for action.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart stars as Scottie, a police detective who has retired on disability.  This disability was caused when a fellow detective fell to his death while trying to rescue Scottie.  Scottie suffers badly from vertigo, a paralyzing fear of heights.  Scottie feels guilty about the man's death, and dreams of it nightly.  Scottie is reluctantly coaxed out of retirement when an old friend begs him to help him follow his wife, who has been acting strangely.  The supernatural element of the film is introduced in chilling fashion as Gavin says to Scottie, "Do you believe that someone out of the past - someone dead - can . . . enter and take possession of a living being?"<br /><br />Gavin's wife, Madeline, is played very well by Kim Novak, who plays a dual role in the film.  Madeline is so beautiful, yet  vulnerable.  Scottie falls in love with her.  Many twists follow, almost all of them gripping and horrifying.  It is a film that deserves multiple viewings.<br /><br />Vertigo was retrieved from the vaults and lovingly restored at the cost of a million dollars.  The widescreen VHS edition has a making of Vertigo documentary at the end that shows clips before and after restoration.  The documentary also contains present-day interviews with Kim Novak and others who worked on the film.  You will gain a greater appreciation of Vertigo after viewing the documentary.  The film restorers did an amazing job.  The widescreen VHS edition is even better than a DVD because it has a unique foldout cover with a limited edition booklet about the movie and it's making.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Animation as Only Tim Burton Can Do It"></head><body><p>I'm sure most of my friends are surprised that I've never seen this movie before, but you must remember that I've only owned a DVD player for about three and a half years [written in 2009], and almost never went to movies in theaters before that. I didn't know anything about Tim Burton until I discovered Johnny Depp, and I thought Depp was going to be the voice of Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King. But it's OK that he's not: it's still a very fun movie.<br /><br />The basic premise is that all the holidays come from their own towns, accessible through hollow trees that stand in a ring with symbols of the holidays involved on each one. One has a profile of a turkey, one a red heart, one a painted egg, another a pumpkin, and one a decorated tree. I think there were others, but I don't remember exactly. The narrator takes us through the pumpkin shaped door into the world of Halloween Town, which is supposed to be very scary and spooky, but is mostly funny, and perhaps would be gross if they weren't animations. The Mayor is a roly-poly character with two faces, one grinning and one menacing, who wears a badge saying "Mayor" and who says, "I'm only an elected official; I can't make decisions by myself." The real hero is Jack, the Pumpkin King. He's every bit as skinny as a skeleton except that he wears a black pin-striped suit.<br /><br />But Jack is bored of the same old thing every year, and goes wandering off to bemoan his fate, finally discovering the ring of trees with the doors to other holidays. He goes into the one for Christmas and is overwhelmed. It's wonderful! All bright lights and happy people, and he wants it for his own.<br /><br />Then there is Sally, Dr. Finkelstein's creation, a sweet blue girl who is his slave. She's all stitches, and can break off an arm or a leg as necessary, sewing it back when there's time. She's in love with Jack, and Finkelstein keeps her from him except for when she puts a sleeping potion in his food so she can get away.<br /><br />So when Jack comes back to Halloween Town to get everyone hyped up to make Christmas this year, he asks Sally to make a Santa Claus costume for him. He's misunderstood, and thinks it is Sandy Claws who is in charge of Christmas, and something frightening instead of beloved. When the Boogie's boys go and capture Santa Claus for him, he looks at him and declares, "Why you have hands! Where are your claws?"<br /><br />No, I'm not going to spoil it. Much of the fun is the music and the visual effects of the various characters in Halloween Town, and the gifts and toys they make for Christmas. But there is a plot (all puns intended), and the basic question is how can Halloween and Christmas get back to their proper spheres?<br /><br />Anyone over the age of 5 or 6 will probably love this one, right up to 95 or 96.</p></body></html>

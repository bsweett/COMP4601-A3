<meta name="summary" content="Blood and Loneliness...."></head><body><p>I will not join the subtitle controversy, so I am not reviewing the DVD here, but rather the film, and as a film it is superb.  The words that come to mind are: evocative, stark, meditative, intelligent, deliberate, chill and haunting.<br /><br />It is the heart of Swedish winter, those days of long nights, spare sunlight, a stark and barren landscape of winter sky and drifted snow, deep black and white, and a slim and delicate 12 year old boy living with his divorced mother, bullied at school, isolated and lonely meets a new neighbor, a strange girl near his age and in turn equally isolated and alienated from her surroundings.  A timid contact is made and a growing connection is made between the two kindred spirits, while eerie and bloody mayhem ensues.<br /><br />Yes, it's a vampire film, but what is again demonstrated here is that when intelligence is brought to any genre you have something else quite unexpected and special.  The themes of loneliness, isolation and the heart and meaning of "strangeness" and the understanding of the "other" are subtext to a thriller that has some graphic and disturbing violence and gore, but done by film-makers with the sense to know that what you don't show can be just as effective or even more so than what you do show.<br /><br />There has been good reason for the buzz around this film, coming out around the same time as bigger budgeted and hyped film and TV shows in the same genre.  This film demonstrates how atmosphere can be made by the accumulation of detail, carefully unfolding.  They don't play with the audience in that they get to the bloody business early on, but it is revealed with deliberate care.  It may sound incongruous to say, but the graphic gore is handled with tact.  It is the glimpsed horror you see and the further horror imagined.  It is the artful use of camera angle, and consideration of a building of tension and violence.  It isn't all about special effects, it is about using them to the greatest effect by not shoving them in the audience face all the time.<br /><br />That and a mood of overall stillness.  There is something truly eerie about a brutal killing in the quiet of blanketed snow or in the middle of a sleek & blandly modern town square in dead winter night.  They captured it here and it is memorable.<br /><br />The two young leads are well cast, the girl especially has a wonderful look that is both normal and otherworldly, especially here large, hypnotic eyes.  The rest is a marvelous evocation from an intelligent script and first rate production and direction.  Well done all around, nearly classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful Blu-ray, Very Good Movie"></head><body><p>I'm not sure why this film has been so maligned. I have not seen the first film "Elizabeth" with Cate Blanchett and this director, so I cannot compare the two. I can confirm that watching the blu-ray of "Elizabeth:The Golden Age" is a beautiful experience. Blanchett is stunning as the queen and the range of her queenly and womanly emotions during a very tricky historical time is very impressive. The costumes are heavenly, the sets outrageously detailed and beautiful, and the Craig Armstrong score is lush and memorable. While some argue, and rightly so, that the film is historically inaccurate, I disregard those complaints and sit back and enjoy a very good film that takes me back to the time period in question. I'm very glad that this is part of my collection.</p></body></html>

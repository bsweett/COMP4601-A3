A great cameo by Michael Tyson is welcome, but the film is not as side-splittingly funny as it is awkward and uncomfortable; for truly side-splittingly funny (as well as some good scene stealing, and even some real character development), you need to look no further than the female version of The Hangover, which is called Bridesmaids. Of course, us guys can't admit that to other guys ("Huh? You thought a film called `Bridesmaids' was funnier than `The Hangover', which all of us have lived in our lives and can totally relate to? I haven't even heard of that film, much less seen it"), but it's actually true. The "oh-I-get-it-now" moment at the end is pure Scooby Doo, and the "henpecked boyfriend finally figures out that his girlfriend is a bitch" cliche resolution at the end is a bit superfluous. But don't get me wrong - the "Wolf Pack" speech alone is worth the price of admission, both for its surrealness as well as its twee naivete, as are the early scenes when Zach Galifianakis is introduced as the goofy brother-in-law. Good one, guys.<br /><br />Gettin' ready for deja vu with the sequel...</p></body></html>

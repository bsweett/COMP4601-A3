<meta name="summary" content="Awesomely Perfect Psychological Performance by Ralph Fiennes"></head><body><p>I did not yet view the 1986 'Manhunter' that already brought Thomas Harris' novel 'Red Dragon' to the screen, but I cannot imagine anyone portraying Frances Dolarhyde, the voice-hearing psychopathic killer, any better than Ralph Fiennes.  Even if you don't like or are tired of Hannibal Lecter after the campy focus on him in the last film installment, (Hannibal) Ralph Fiennes' performance of a quiet man filled with inner rage stemming from a horrible childhood simmers with surpressed sexuality and yearning and is not to be missed.  "Dee" as he is nicknamed by co-workers is a churning river of past angst that demands renumeration, like a tide that cannot retreat, he encroaches on his unsuspecting victims, passing through with a tempest's increasing strength. The only calm allowed to this storm seems to be in the person of a blind woman played by Emily Watson. As she cannot see his slight facial deformity, he accepts her more readily, allowing his need for contact to creep through while his killer persona is on short hiatus.  With well-honed acting skill Fiennes waxes pathetically spellbound by her attention---one gets the sense that during this sequence the eye of his storm is passing; her questions regarding his life titillate and exhilarate what little humanity is left him.  Particularly touching is a moment where "Dee" takes Reba to "see" a tranquilized tiger, to further buttress one of her last sights before illness stole her sight. Fiennes is magnificient, his shyness poignant, his madness heart-wrenching.<br />Other remarkable performances include Emily Watson as Reba, Philip Seymour Hoffman as the scruffily annoying journalist and of course, Anthony Hopkins as the chillingly trumped Dr Lector--here as this is a prequel, sporting as dark Eurotrash slick-backed queue.  Edward Norton does an adequate job as the FBI agent Will Graham. Attacked by Lector in an unforgettable scene before the opening credits, Norton achieves an understandable wariness that sometimes borders on downright reluctance to ever see Lector again,let alone confer with him.  Rather than have his motivation to capture the Fiennes character be the threat to his wife and son and its obvious connection to the new killer's focus on family, I would have liked to have seen more of his personal terror--maybe in fugue states flashing key moments of Lector's attack on him. I would have also liked to have explored that portion of Graham's character that Lector intimates from Graham's success in flushing Lector out as being composed of part pride, part mental superiority and part affinity with the criminal mind.<br />Nevertheless, the film is great---intense----psychologically satisfying and disturbing enough to warrant after movie discussion. Not only does it keeps one's attention from start to finish, but despite some of the disgustingly gory sights, (not for children!!) compels one to keep both eyes on the screen at all times.  Don't miss it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not even CLOSE to the book -- but it still IS a fun adventure."></head><body><p>A couple years ago I interviewed Clive Cussler and asked him why it has taken so long for another one of his novels to be turned into a movie?  He told me that he was SO upset at how Hollywood butchered 'Raise the Titanic' (one of the greatest adventure novels EVER written, by the way) that he would NEVER again sell one of his novels...UNLESS he had script approval, actor approval and director approval.  Virtually every year someone came knocking on his door making another offer, and he said the same thing: "Sure...just give me what I want and you can pick and choose which book you want to put to film."  They kept saying there was no way that would happen, so he politely declined each year, even though they kept offering more and more money each time.  FINALLY somebody made the appropriate concession and suddenly 'Sahara' was turned into a viable screenplay.  However Clive became unimpressed at the adaptation and against the deal they had made, decided to go ahead with the script they had WITHOUT author approval...hence the lawsuit we keep hearing about.<br /><br />While 'Sahara' is not the Cussler novel I would have picked to put on the big screen, it IS a fun book (as are all of the Dirk Pitt stories) and I looked forward to it nevertheless.  I MUST admit as many others have noticed, the deviation of the written plot, especially leaving out the historical Abraham Lincoln storyline left me almost disgusted -- at first.  Cussler told me that of ALL the hundreds of fictional characters he has created over the years, only Al Giordino was based on a REAL person.  For personal reasons, he was VERY determined to make sure that Giordino was cast correctly...but unfortunately finding a short, muscle-bound, curly black haired Italian was easier said than done.  After months of searching, it became obvious that finding the RIGHT person to play the role as written in the Pitt novels just wasn't going to happen.  This certainly helped me to accept that blunder much better -- even though I REALLY enjoyed Steve Zahn's performance as Al.  It was well done and offered the biggest laughs of the entire movie bar-none.<br /><br />After seeing it on the big screen and again on DVD, I did my best to watch it without any expectations as a Cussler fan, and you know what?  It was pretty dang fun anyways.  Sure, a lot of details were dropped (quite a LOT actually) from the novel, but one thing I was VERY impressed at was how family-friendly the movie was as a whole.  Sure there was action and violence, but the sex and language was pretty much nil -- which goes against virtually ALL the Hollywood norms these days.<br /><br />In short: for the Dirk Pitt fans who are also the purists and expect no change from the written novels, you may want to pass on 'Sahara'.  For those who are looking for a fun, adventure-laced movie loosely based on a Cussler book, you are in for a fun time.  I think I fall somewhere in between.  I enjoyed the movie, but I am also disappointed that the storyline wasn't followed closer.  All in all I will eagerly await a follow-up Dirk Pitt movie (if Cussler even allows it...which is questionable at best at this point...) and I felt that the casting of Matthew as Dirk Pitt was right on.  I have wondered for YEARS who in Hollywood would do the character justice and I must admit, he did a great job.  I hope he gets another opportunity to do it again.  My choice for next book to be turned into movie: Atlantis Found or Dragon.  Just a thought.</p></body></html>

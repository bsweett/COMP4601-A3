PHOTOGRAPHY, SHARP, CRISP COLORS, AND GREAT AC-3 SOUND ALL ADD UP TO A ROLLICKING FUN FEST. STILLER HAS NEVER BEEN MORE EVIL, AND VINCE VAUGHN AND HIS TEAM-NEVER MORE HUMILITATINGLY FUNNY. IT IS A LAUGHFEST FROM START TO HILARIOUS FINISH.  PUT IT UNDER THE TREE OF ANYONE THAT ENJOYS AN OBSCENE LAUGHFEST.</p></body></html>

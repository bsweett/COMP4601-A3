The special effects are sometimes great, and I cheered for the heroes of this well made epic movie. Sam worthington as Perseus is a character that is more a simple man, not made up to be a demi-god. He cherishes his human roots and believes that all gods are decietfull, and full of mischief. It is much different than the original perseus, who is played by a male model, with long tresses of dark hair, and always had an awe for the gods. Sam plays perseus with accusing hate, and revenge towards a particular god that was not in the original clash of the titans. The change here is unexpected, and for me, I enjoyed it greatly. It gives new meaning to clash of the titans when hades is involved who is a powerful god.<br /><br />I tossed out everything I had heard of going into this movie, and because of that, I think I can enjoy this movie for the fun that it is. I would even say that the script is well thought out and very dramatic at times. I particularly enjoyed how andromeda was played down in this. Perseus is not so impressed with looks, in the original persueus was a ladies man, this is a drastic change from the older version. And it was a reward for me that Perseus did not suddenly fall in some flimsy love with the stunning andromeda, but instead for the girl that truely loved him. Perseus is a hero, a demi-god, but he is not some diva, and he earns his keep throughout this movie. I thought this change made the casting of Sam Worthington perfect in my eyes. He can play the everyman with ease, and it is natural for him. I was afraid at first, that maybe he was miscasted, because of the vision of the male model Perseus I had from the original.<br /><br />The special effects are very handsome, when it comes to some of the effects that are made by Hades and his witches. I also loved the visuals of this movie in general. The makeup of the three sisters was creepy, and much different than the original. The look of madusa was very different than any picture of madusa that I have ever seen. She has a beautiful face, but with snakes for hair and has a different, enraged, face she takes when stunning men into stone. The original focused on sounds and reflections more, and it is a classic scene. They do not rely so much in this version, but they do prep the scene that gives it another layer of substance it wouldn't of had without the setup. Some of my favorite characters meet their doom here, and the battle with madusa is more of a mouse and bait scene with perseus, and does not have the potency and sense of danger that the original had, but it was still a great scene in itself.<br /><br />The movie is layered nicely, with a story that you will not fight, but watch willingly. Instead of having a problem with the changes, I rather did not have trouble with the treatment from the classic movie. I have compared some scenes such as the medusa scene, because it tries to retain some of the classic feel, but does not do as well. But the main strength of this movie for me were the many exciting changes to the story, and the unwilling father, son relationship that later on develops into something meaningful.<br /><br />There are many words of wisdom that you listen to, as many different people and gods teach the young Perseus, and it makes for an enjoyable, social setting that the original also had. Help comes unexpected, and in mysterious ways, as is the way of the ancient gods and the new version is successful in recreating it for a new generation. You will meet new characters, which will become a heroic party, that reminded me more of Krull, more than the original clash of the titans. There goal is worthy, and there are many heroe's, and not all of them carry swords. Andromeda is a hero for the sacrifice she was willing to make. And in a way, the soldiers who decimate the homages to the gods are heroe's also, because the dared challenge a god and stood for what they believed in.<br /><br />This is a great movie, with lots of adventure, and epic battles. I had a great amount of fun during the entirety of the film and think it has repeat value as well. The special effects are well done in most cases and the changes to the origianal are mostly good. I recommend this great film.</p></body></html>

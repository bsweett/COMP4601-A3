Will and Elizabeth are offered clemency by Lord Cutler Beckett if Will can get Jack's compass which points to what its possessor wants most. Along the way, Will runs to the Flying Dutchman, and meets Davy Jones who is also after Jack. Eventually, Davy sends out the Kraken, the large beast who belongs to Davy that stalks the waters. I highly recommend PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST!!!</p></body></html>

Washington fully fleshes out this LAPD narcotics star policeman and how he's gotten to the top of his field by becoming one with the enemy.  In fact, you can even see the tidbits left over in his personality from the man he used to be.  Washington gives us little flashes of that man, showing us they are just about totally gone but not quite.  Ethan Hawke always holds his own in a movie and this one is no exception.  His is a less showy role since he is the good guy cop but he nicely develops his character's moral dilemma throughout.  He is a squeaky clean young cop who is dedicated to eradicating crime the "right" way but his idealism looks fair to crushing him in modern day LA and with the LAPD. A very well written script, a stylish director who knew what he wanted to accomplish, actual LA gang members in the cast and some good performances from music industry members round out the film nicely.  I am not a fan of "cop" movies but this movie does not fit easily into any broad ...[category], thankfully.</p></body></html>

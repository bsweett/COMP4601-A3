A New York cop faces terrorists taking over a L.A.<br />building on Christmas Eve. This is definitely one of Bruce's<br />best and Alan is unforgettable as Hans Gruber. This 2-disc<br />set has good picture and sound plus neat extras. If you<br />like action or Bruce fighting terrorists wearing a wife-<br />beater, get this classic.</p></body></html>

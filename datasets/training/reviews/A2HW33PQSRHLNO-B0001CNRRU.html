It turned on itself and in us, until it finally brought us together in this dream.""></head><body><p>"21 Grams" is the sort of movie which sucks the life out of you--I don't think there is one agony in the human conditioned left unturned, one painful rock left uncovered, one intimation of the fragility of human existence left without inspection in this movie.  Then, like the natural cycles of life, the sun shines meekly when the night gets darkest.<br /><br />Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu provides with a scathing glimpse into the lives of three people for whom life has indeed become little else, particularly for Sean Penn's character Paul, a cynical mathematics professor for whom life has become little more than a long convalescence: the victim of a fatal heart condition, he is slowly dying but shows rather negative signs of vitality.  He refuses to stop smoking and recognizes that his wife, played unlikably well by Charlotte Gainsbourg, has never been the one for him.  She badgers him for a sample of his sperm with the process of artificial insemination and it does not seem to the viewer that it is out of any concern for him or a desire to "continue" his existence in some way: it is for her own satisfaction and hope for a new life.  Rather than taking the safe route, he elects to die outside the hospital than taking the advice of his doctor and dying in the hospital.<br /><br />Christina (Naomi Watts) is a woman with a husband and three children and a recovering cocaine addict. Her life has become more stable as her attention is directed towards the welfare of her family. A car crash involving Jack, an ex-con turned Christian, turns all of their lives around forever. This film is completely non linear, but unlike "Memento" or "Mulholland Drive" it does not take multiple viewings to show what is happening.  If you really concentrate you'll understand.<br /><br />Neither of the aforementioned actors--Penn, Del Toro, or Watts--have transcended the work they did in this film.  The acting is fantastic, and I have to disagree with some viewers' about it being "hopeless": the subtext about Penn and his warning shot at the end, which brings everything together, is what brings salvation.  It is gritty and true to real life, almost uncomfortably so--you'd think you were watching a documentary with amazingly sincere people at times--but it is no way hopeless.<br /><br />This ranks among one of the best films I've seen to emerge in this decade.  Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

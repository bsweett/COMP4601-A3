North by Northwest is what I would call "old school cool," and there has never been, before or since, a more charming or likeable actor than Cary Grant.  I dare anybody to take their eyes off this one--even to go to the bathroom.  This marks the third time I've seen it and I found it just as fulfilling as the two before it.<br /><br />James Mason was an amazing actor and I'd place him just below Olivier on the talent meter.  Here he plays a perfect nemesis for Grant as a foreign agent who "imports/exports" information to the east during The Cold War.  In this role, Mason is quite believeable.<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint is exceptional and the love that develops between herself and Grant is something that the audience readily buys into.  There's nothing contrived about their relationship.  It makes the movie just as much a romance as a thriller.<br /><br />Unlike the movies fabricated today, there is no sex or nudity to be seen here, but we are made to fully understand the emotions of the characters.  The dialogue between Grant and Saint is absolutely precious, particularly when they meet on the train and speak in the dining car.  Words like these are seldom heard in the movies of the present: "How does a girl like you get to be a girl like you?"  And my favorite:<br /><br />"Men like you don't believe in marriage."<br /><br />"But I've been married twice."<br /><br />"See what I mean."<br /><br />One wishes that some of these exchanges were examined before screenplays were stamped out in this new century.<br /><br />The entire movie is shot in the "man alone" motif as Grant, ala Gary Cooper, stands up to forces far superior than himself.  His resourcefulness is the glue that binds the plot together. This advertising executive is quite successful in outpacing East German (presumably) agents and the police who are out to hang him. The ending is marvelous but, of course, in case you're one of the rare people who has never seen it, I will not give the climax away.</p></body></html>

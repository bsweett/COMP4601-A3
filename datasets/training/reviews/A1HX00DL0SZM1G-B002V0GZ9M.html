<meta name="summary" content="Suspend your disbelief and pay a visit to the Lake House"></head><body><p>The movie "The Lake House" is certainly a movie that challenges you to suspend your disbelief but it seems a majority of people seem incapable of doing so for this movie, yet are able to believe that a mystical force controls all things in the Universe (Star Wars), that a man can fly (Superman) or, gasp, that a truck can turn into a robot (Transformers).<br />For me this movie is pure fantasy and I have no problem taking it for what it is - namely a romantic movie with a supernatural element. I don't sit there and try and figure out how or why the mailbox works the way it does just like I don't sit there and wonder how the Enterprise reaches warp speed (Star Trek) or the man outraces the Sun (Mummy Returns).<br />The plot is basically a love story and rather than two people falling in love over the internet and e-mail they instead do it the old fashioned way and fall in love through snail mail. However the device of the time difference means that the two cannot simply meet face-to-face in a traditional date. The plot reminded me of a similar plot device in a TV movie I saw where two lovers corresponded the same way across centuries with the letters magically appearing in an old cabinet.<br />Take the movie for what it is and pick up this enjoyable, charming romantic movie on Blu-ray for under $10 (as of Nov. 13, 2009). The audio and video quality are far from steller, but they are better than on an upconverted DVD.</p></body></html>

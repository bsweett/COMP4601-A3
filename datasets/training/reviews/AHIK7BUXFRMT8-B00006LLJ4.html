<meta name="summary" content="An Imaginative Sci-Fi Action Flick"></head><body><p>This movie starts fast and quickly immerses the viewer in a very strange world with dialog and action that blazes along making it difficult to keep up. The important thing is to hang in there and the pieces will all start to fit together. The movie is based on a novella by Philip K. Dick who is known for his highly original imagination and who has come up with ideas for stories unlike anyone else. This is another one of those original story lines and takes the viewer on a wild ride.<br /><br />Fortunately the pieces begin to all fit together and do so with dramatic use of the surround speakers and plenty of action on screen. The basic premise of the movie is a technology has developed that permits the viewing of a crime before it actually happens so police can step in and stop the crime before it has taken place. Just as this system of crime prevention is ready to go nationwide something happens that changes everything. The Tom Cruise character, a policeman named John Anderton, is suddenly plunged into a situation that threatens his very life.<br /><br />He must now use the crime prevention system called Precrime to find out the truth and discover who is out to frame him. His search for the truth provides the basis for this exciting action movie.<br /><br />I encourage the viewer to give the movie a chance because although at first it might seem confusing it quickly shapes up into a good sci-fi adventure movie.</p></body></html>

They are great friends and I don't see anything wrong with who they want to spend their life with. Because I feel so strong about gay man I knew I would like this movie before seeing it. I wasn't wrong, this is a great love story. Yes I said Love Story. It doesn't have to be about a man and a woman to make it a love story. This movie is about two man who worked together on Brokeback Mountain alone one year. One night they had sex together. One feels like he did wrong and the other is in love. After their job was done at Brokeback Mountain they both went on with their life. Getting married and having children. They both found each other again and every so months they got together to show their love for each other. I don't believe there was any more sex scenes but you can see how much they care for each other. SO NO THIS MOVIE IS NOT A GAY PORN MOVIE. Like someone wrote on here. This is a must see or have movie.</p></body></html>

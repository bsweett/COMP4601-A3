A man getting revenge for the death of his family, it is a very possible thing that could happen in real life. This movie brings it with action and drama. As you watch Castle's family die, you feel the rage that Frank is feeling at the time, only waiting until the bad guys meet their certain end.<br /><br />John Travolta, as usual, is fantastic in this film as the main villain. Everyone on here is great in their role. You cheer for the hero, and you can't wait to see the bad guys die. It takes great acting to pull emotion like that out of an audience and it does that perfectly.<br /><br />I'm also a fan of and own the original movie The Punisher and I have to say that the 2004 movie, while I love the other, is my favorite between the two. It has more of a background of who Frank is and why he wears the skull T-shirt, which he didn't do in the original movie.</p></body></html>

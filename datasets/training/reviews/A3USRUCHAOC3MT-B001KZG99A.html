<meta name="summary" content="Very enjoyable superhero movie"></head><body><p>When I was a teenager, I read both Marvel and DC Comics.  My favorite heroes were respectively Iron Man and Batman.  I have yet to see Dark Knight yet, but from what I hear, Iron Man is the more positive, feel good side.<br /><br />The best summer movies are ones that wow you with special effects but also have performances that captivate you, and this one has that.  Sometimes a movie is overloaded with star power to draw you in; with this movie, the stars were selected because of their talent.  When I saw this movie in the theater, the only actor I expected to see was Robert Downey, who was as good as the film critics said he was.  Believe it or not, I didn't recognize Gwyneth Paltrow, though she caught my attention with her excellent performance of Pepper Potts.<br /><br />In the novel "Moonraker" by Ian Fleming, the villain told James Bond that if a man is bald and grows a mustache, even his mother wouldn't recognize him.  What does that have to do with "Iron Man"?  Jeff Bridges proves the point in this movie.  I did not recognize one of my favorite actors.  Again, his talent gave life to the role of Obadiah Stane.<br /><br />I have, as I grew up, stopped keeping up with the comics though I am usually interested in the Marvel movies.  When I was a teenager, Tony Stark was captured and became Iron Man in Vietnam.  I learned that the story changed twice since then, and the movie follows the current version of Iron Man's origin.<br /><br />This movie can be considered a little slow in its development.  The real action is at the beginning and towards the end.  This is where the casting helped pull the movie off, because I was kept interested by the portrayals of the actors.<br /><br />Of course, Stan Lee makes a cameo.  There were a couple of hints of what might come in a sequel (Terrence Howard's character eyeing an armor suit and the mention of SHIELD) that would leave a non-Marvel fan scratching his head and wondering what that was about, which I felt was a chink in the armor of this movie.  Also, I felt the movie sputtered in its final minutes.  (The editorial review loved the ending -- I didn't.)  These negative elements won't stop you from enjoying the movie.</p></body></html>

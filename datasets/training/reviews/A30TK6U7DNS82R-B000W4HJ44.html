<meta name="summary" content="Walk Through the Hairspray"></head><body><p>Some people don't like the long civil rights march that comes two thirds of the way through the movie, with Queen Latifah singing the powerful song about she knows where she's going and she knows where's been.  I like it just fine, but its staging and arrangement sure reminds me of "Walk Through the Fire" from the "Once More with Feeling" episode of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  To my surprise I find the same choreographer responsible for both.  In this case, the original had that little bit of unexpected edge, but here the subject of the civil rights struggle in Baltimore has the weight of gravitas and history behind it, so I guess it's a draw.  If the same slow-moving, lurching camera and candlelight shows up in Adam Shankman's next picture, though, that will be the true test of the auteur theory and you read it here first.<br /><br />It's true that none of the young people of HAIRSPRAY are as likeable as those in the original John Waters movie, here they all seem to be trying too hard, and just as mystifying is why they decided to cast two young actresses who look so much alike, as Tracy's best friend Penny and worst enemy Amber von Tussle.  We decided it was because they were trying to ignite a Freudian interpretation in which Penny and Amber are revealed as two sides of the same coin: mother, whore, and crone all mixed together, so that Tracy would not know whom she was confiding in.  She doesn't really seem to care anyhow, as placed by Nikki Blonsky she's as blithe and oblivious as though she were still slinging ice cream down at the Cold Stone Creamery in Great Neck.  But she's great despite this peculiarity of interpretation, and even if her Tracy Turnblad never seems to feel bad about racism or segregation, at least she gets up and  does something about it.</p></body></html>

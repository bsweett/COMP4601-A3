The disc is definitely not in Transformers level quality.  However, considering the low budget roots of Arnie and James Cameron's sci-fi/horror/chase film, I don't think you could expect more from the source materials.<br /><br />Even after so many years, 25 years at that, this low budget shocker still packs a punch.  Other than Predator, its hard to find Arnold in a better, more suiting role.  Cameron's story, plotting and editing keep the film on boil until the last screen.  I think only the sex scene comes off as a little out of place.<br /><br />While the 1960s era special effects of 2001: A Space Odyssey look seamless on Blu-Ray, the miracles of high-def do no favors for the 1984 makeup and matte effects of Terminator.  The sound can be muted at times but good overall.  Again, considering the film's budget limitations and guerilla-style filmmaking of Cameron in those days, this is about as good as the source will allow us to enjoy.<br /><br />Comparing to the endless releases of T2 editions packed with extra content, there are precious few add-ons with The Terminator. Visual clarity and color are all very consistent.  Sharpness is hit and miss but in the end, its the content that counts.  The Terminator is a great archival shelf title that will outlast its visual flaws.  Blu-Ray will allow you to enjoy the last ounce of quality, other formats did not.  And finding the title between $10 and $15, depending on where you look, its a great buy too.</p></body></html>

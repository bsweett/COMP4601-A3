<meta name="summary" content="Clint Eastwood proves himself a hero once again"></head><body><p>This film, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, is nothing short of a delightful gift to those of us who have loved Clint Eastwood through the years.  Here, he plays the role of a nasty old Korean War veteran who thinks like it's still the 1950s and is angry all the time.  His wife has just died, his two sons don't respect him and his granddaughter wears a belly ring and wants his vintage 1972 Gran Torino car which he, himself, assembled when he worked in a Ford plant many years before.  Also, a young-fresh faced Catholic priest keeps hounding him to go to confession.<br /><br />Clint lives alone in a neighborhood that is fast becoming multicultural and he hates his Hmong neighbors which he refers to as "gooks."  But things change when he catches the teenager, Thao, from next door trying to steal his prized automobile.  The teen's sister, Sue, convinces Clint to let the boy work off his debt and soon a begrudging respect seems to soften Clint a little as he see how hard the boy works.<br /><br />The neighborhood is rife with gang warfare and drive-by shootings are common.  So is the constant recruitment of the gangs for new members and the Hmong gang wants Thao.  Clint starts to train Thao for a job in the construction industry so that he doesn't have to join the gang and this leads to some of the funniest scenes in the film as he tries to teach Thao to "act like a man" and throw ethnic insults at everyone.  Thao becomes his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and Clint becomes friendly with the Hmong family, especially when the women keep bringing him food.<br /><br />Soon, though there is a crisis and Clint, who we soon discover is probably dying, must prove himself as a hero.  I knew he would do something but was surprised at the complexity of the conclusion, which made the film work as a whole and ended in an extremely satisfying way.<br /><br />I loved this film.  I laughed out loud at times and also felt real emotion as Clint grows to accept the present world in which he lives and winds up emerging a hero.  I have nothing but accolades for this production although I know that some might cringe at the racist insults and find it a little too violent.  But that's what a Clint Eastwood film is about.</p></body></html>

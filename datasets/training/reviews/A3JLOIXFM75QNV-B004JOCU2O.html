<meta name="summary" content="One of the most boring action films in recent memory"></head><body><p>So this film is literally all about a runaway train. That's pretty much it. Denzel Washington and Chris Pine's characters spend the last half hour of the film trying to be heros and stop the train all by themeselves in their own little train, going backwards. Oh and of course there are dangerous chemicals onboard the runaway train and of course it is heading towards a highly populated city where it will surely run off the track if no one stops it and disintegrate everything in the area. Oh, there's a pointless subplot about how Pine's character has a restraining order and can't see his son and wife and of course Washington's character has a small issue with his two daughters too. I'm pretty sure I covered the entire movie. That really is it. Zero suspense, predictable ending and can't forget the clich&eacute; characters!</p></body></html>

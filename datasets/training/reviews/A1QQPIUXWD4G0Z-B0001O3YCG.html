<meta name="summary" content="A Sci-Fi/Horror Genre Long Overdue"></head><body><p>It had been quite some time prior to this film that a successful sci-fi/horror genre had been released.  Audiences were mostly being burried under a pile of mediocre alien films and cheap conventional horror.  Director David Twohy brought back this fading genre with new concepts, good effects, and a rather decent cast.<br /><br />The plot is laid out in the main review and so I won't go over it here.  The story itself is solid and allows the audience to immerse themselves in the adventure of the characters without great leaps in reasoning: a common problem in the science fiction genre.  In terms of acting, Radha Mitchell played a very credible role as a shaken but resolute captain. The star of the show is of course Vin Diesel as Riddick, a shiny eyed alien who can see in the dark.  His character was the basis of a less-than-stellar spinoff 'Chronicles of Riddick.'  Cole Hauser as Riddick's tormentor also did a pretty good job.  The film has excellent special effects with monsters that are quite terrifying to look at.<br /><br />A fun cat-and-mouse horror/sci-fi film that is worth multiple viewings.  I strongly recommend it.</p></body></html>

The first half of the movie takes place in a futuristic city, sort of an anti-utopia where every choice is made for  you, every aspect of your life is planned to optimize your health, because, we are lead to believe, a global contamination, or epidemic, has left few survivors, which are all brought to the city when found.  Life is pretty mundane, though healthy and stable.  Citizens have little to look forward to except a slim chance of winning a trip to the one remaining uncontaminated spot on Earth:  The Island.<br /><br />Lincoln (Ewan McGregor) is one of these survivors who learns the real purpose of the city, it's occupants, and most ominously and secretly, trips to the Island.  Lincoln and  his girlfriend Jordan (Scarlett Johansson) embark on their own "Logan's Run" to escape the city and reveal the deadly secret.  The rest of the film is an action-packed chase involving explosions and crashes of just about every type of vehicle, with more effective special effects than most action movies -  in broad daylight in realistic settings.<br /><br />Sean Bean is good as the bad guy, Steve Buscemi better as one of his employees, Ethan Philips best as one of their typical victims.<br /><br />It's a little bit morbid in spots, but otherwise suitable and recommended for the whole family.  It does have a timely message, though to discuss it would give away too much of the plot.  See it.</p></body></html>

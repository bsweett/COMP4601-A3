<meta name="summary" content="Exciting Action Movie with a Gratifying Ending."></head><body><p>As an action movie fan I could be expected to enjoy Unstoppable, but to our surprise, my wife, who is not usually an action movie fan, enjoyed it too. The movie gets off to a fast start and picks up speed from there; by the time the movie is over your ready for a rest.<br /><br />Both Denzel Washington and Chris Pine turn in effective performances drawing the viewer into the action. This is a worthy addition to the collection of any action movie fan. I recommend it highly.</p></body></html>

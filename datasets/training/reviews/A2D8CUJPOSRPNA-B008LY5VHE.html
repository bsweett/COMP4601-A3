<meta name="summary" content="The Film You Can Really Sink Your Teeth Into"></head><body><p>In the pantheon of all-time great horror and suspense films, JAWS is not merely a quarter-billion dollar box office blockbuster, but excellent cinema to boot.  From a popular novel by Peter Benchley, this quickly became a legendary film--and it's not hard to see why.  With Steven Spielberg as director, and a trio of leading men who give high-caliber performances, it's no wonder that this remains one of the top movies of its kind.<p>The film's plot is well known: Amity Island is beset by a series of attacks carried out by a mysterious Great White shark, and the powers-that-be don't want to cause a panic and destroy the summer tourism season.  Roy Scheider is Amity's police chief Martin Brody, whose calls to temporarily shut down the beaches until the shark can be killed are thwarted by a mayor (Murray Hamilton) and a town council more concerned with making bucks than saving people's lives.  Richard Dreyfuss is the shark expert who confirms the presence of a Great White in the local waters.  Robert Shaw is Quint, the local fisherman who is half-crazy from the start and just itching to have his own Moby Dick-like showdown.<p>When the shark causes a total panic on the beach on the 4th of July, it is up to these three men to hunt down the elusive fish.  But once out on the open water, these three hunters also become the hunted; at one point, the shark jumps out from the water, and frightens Scheider so much that he tells Shaw, famously: &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat.&quot;<p>After taking an endless pounding from the shark, Shaw's boat the &quot;Orca&quot; begins to flounder.  Shaw is eventually eaten whole by the shark, and Dreyfuss is temporarily lost under water.  It is up to Scheider, a man with a severe case of hydrophobia, to kill the shark.  He shoves a scuba tank into the fish's mouth, aims, fires, and blows the shark into a million pieces.<p>The making of JAWS was extremely arduous and difficult.  Spielberg was faced day after day with problems involving the mechanical shark that was used on location; the thing refused to function properly half the time.  The budget and schedule swelled to the point that Spielberg almost got fired.  Ironically, even though the shark was to be seen throughout the film, because of the technical problems, Spielberg resorted to the tried-and-true method of mere suggestion.<p>This turned out to be the smartest thing.  Now JAWS was no longer a standard-issue monster movie.  Like Spielberg's 1971 suspense masterpiece DUEL, it was now very much in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock, specifically the Master's 1963 film THE BIRDS.  Spielberg's use of Hitchcock's suspense-building techniques, combined with the fine performances of Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfyss, helped to drive JAWS to the top of the box office charts and onto three Oscar wins: editing, sound, and John Williams' now-legendary, cello-driven score.<p>Although followed by three vastly inferior sequels and a lot of lousy imitations, JAWS has lost none of its gut-grabbing power.  It is essential viewing to this very day, especially for horror and suspense film buffs.</p></body></html>

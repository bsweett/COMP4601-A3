Coming out of viewing the film 'The Hurt Locker' is an experience in itself. You feel exhilarated and drained, and you feel the film for hours. This is the best film about war I have ever seen. The New York Times has said "The movie is a viscerally exciting, adrenaline-soaked tour de force of suspense and surprise, full of explosions and hectic scenes of combat, but it blows a hole in the condescending assumption that such effects are just empty spectacle or mindless noise."<br /><br />The focus of this film is the Delta Company, an Army unit whose job is to carefully detonate, if all else fails -- the I.E.D.'s that seem to occupy Iraq. Three men are the make-up this unit, Jeremy Renner, who plays Staff Sgt James, one of the more magnificent acting experiences I have seen this year. Sgt. J. T. Sanborn played by Anthony Mackie, a careful man who does everything by the book. Specialist Owen Eldridge played by Brian Geraghty, is a man of mixed emotions, young in nature and emotions, he is having difficulty dealing with the danger, fear and death all around him. He, shows us the Hurt Locker-a place where pain is stored; we come away with a full supply of it.<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow has invited us to become the fourth member of this squad. Through her vision we come up close and personal with the unit. The cameras were placed 360 degrees around each scene, so that every motion and action could be viewed at once. It is a surreal feeling and gives this film the extraordinary view that makes us rock. The fear and the danger are palpable. The acting is the best I have seen. I was gripping my chair, shielding my eyes at times, but opening them because I had to see,just had to.<br />.<br />The dirt, grime, heat, fear are all here. The war has come to America, people. Now stand up straight and tall and take a look. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Highly Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-18-10<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JSJC">Strange Days</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304481101">Born in Flames [VHS</a>]</p></body></html>

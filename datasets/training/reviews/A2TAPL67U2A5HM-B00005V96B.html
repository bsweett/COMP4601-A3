(Collector's Edition)~ Jack Angel is an astounding animated movie that deals with monsters scaring little children to gain energy for their city. The script is well written and the storyline is amazing. John Goodman and Billy Cristal are doing a bang up job in the movie, and I really love the message of acceptance and tolerance. The music is also perfect for the movie and the animation is some of the best I have ever seen. The movie is filled with many classic scenes like the initial scare scene with the high scores and the scene with the kid and the little monster children. This is a movie that I highly recommend and I give it five stars!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Sledgehammer Approach To Love!"></head><body><p>Four of the most physically attractive and artistically talented actors of the Big Screen come together under the direction of the brilliant Mike Nichols to perform in "Closer," an adaptation of Patrick Marber's brutal play, and the result is 104 minutes of utter depression and angst. I thoroughly appreciate the performances of Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owens and Natalie Portman. Their acting skills are not in question here, and frankly, they're all a pleasure to watch. Eye-candy aside, however, I just viewed the movie and feel like someone hit me over the head with a sledgehammer - not a state I appreciate, nor one I would pay to return to. "Closer" is a film about four loathsome people - actually only three are detestable, one is just terribly self-destructive, which is why she hangs out with the others. Although not devoid of merit, this is a cold and wounding piece that left me raw. I am not warning you away. But please do consider my comments before you commit to watch this film. Think aftermath.<br /><br />Dan, (Law), and Alice, (Portman), give each other the eye as they walk toward each other on a London street. She is luscious and so is he. When she steps off the curb and is hit by a cab, Dan is by her side in a second. Lying in the street, Alice regains consciousness, looks up at him and says, "Hello stranger." As he accompanies her to the Emergency Room we discover that he is a journalist - a novelist wannabe - who writes obituaries by day. She is a former stripper from New York City, on a trip across the big Pond. The chemistry between the two is palpable and they hook right up.<br /><br />A year or so later Dan is being photographed for his newly published novel's back cover. The book is about the life of his live-in love, Alice. Anna, (Roberts), is the talented photographer, who specializes in making portraits of strangers. As she snaps away and poses Dan, he makes a play for her. They talk, flirt, kiss passionately - and then Anna discovers he is taken. She makes it clear to Dan that she is recently divorced and not about to mess up any one else's life. He is in a relationship with Alice. He is not available. Period! Alice comes to meet Dan at the studio. She senses something's up very quickly. Then Anna takes Alice's photograph, while tears run down the poor girl's face.<br /><br />Dan becomes obsessed with Anna and stalks her, unbeknownst to Alice. Shortly after the scene at the photography studio, we are introduced to Larry, (Owen), a dermatologist. He is fooling around in a sex chat room on the Internet, having torrid cyber sex with a person he believes to be a woman named Anna. It is really Dan. The outcome of this online tete-a-tete is a set-up for Larry to meet the real Anna at the aquarium. Dan's prank, revenge for the brush-off he received, results in a romance between Larry and Anna. Then the real fooling around begins.<br /><br />Four former strangers, all remotely connected, have become two couples. Each person seems to love his/her mate, yet are compelled to destroy their love, and each other's relationships. Betrayal is a characteristic three of the four share. Dan lusts after Anna, and believes himself "in love" with her, because Anna doesn't "need him." Dan also loves Alice, who loves him madly, but she is too needy. Larry is crazy about Anna. He says it is love, yet people who love each other certainly don't act as manipulative and nasty as Larry does. But then, with Anna, manipulation may the only game in town. Anna is chronically depressed and doesn't think she deserves to be happy. She wants Dan, but he is not available, so she commits to Larry. Then she becomes unhappy and decides that deception may not be so terrible after all. And Larry, who is not to be underestimated, is ruthlessly capable of anything in order to get what he wants. Three characters are narcissistic, cruel, totally obsessed with pain and wrecking emotional havoc. The fourth, Alice, simply seems to hate herself. Is there a plot here? No!! As a character study, what's there to study? There is nothing complex about these people, nor their interactions. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being sublimely happy and 1 being suicidally depressed, these four never manage a 5.<br /><br />Natalie Portman does a superb job, bringing an appealing freshness and vulnerability to the edgy, jaded Alice. Clive Owen's character is the most complex, and his range of emotions really gets a work-out here. He is charming as Anna's suitor, enraged as the betrayed lover, and relentless as the gamesman out for revenge. Jude Law, the cad, comes on strong until his legs are knocked out from under him. Then he is appropriately devastated. Not pretty, but talented. And Julia Roberts, whom I love, is quiet, depressed and odious in her betrayals. The dialogue is very good at times, with snappy, caustic one-liners. My rating is more about personal preference than the movie's overall worth. While this may be an interesting cinematic experience for many, it gave me a headache.<br /><br />JANA</p></body></html>

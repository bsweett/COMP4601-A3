This remake is average to me, I didn't find it scary.  I think the remakes are failing nowadays, as are most horror films.  The acting was tolerable, but nothing award worthy.  I would suggest holding off until this one hits video stores as well because the ticket price is a little high for what you are getting here (I only paid 3.00, which wasn't all that bad)</p></body></html>

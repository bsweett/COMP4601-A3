<meta name="summary" content="The reason to watch: Vince Vaughn as a pimp/producer/manager"></head><body><p>There is one reason and one reason only to see Be Cool: the outrageous performance of Vince Vaughn as Roggie, a would-be music producer/manager who thinks he's black. Seriously. Between the Burberry jogging suits, gold chains, played out slang, and Pimps Up Hoes Down attitude I was almost amused enough not to notice that the rest of this movie was absolute [..]. Almost, but not quite.<br /><br />So if you're going to watch this movie, go ahead and fast forward to all the scenes with Roggie because the rest of it is more or less useless. That's my two cents.</p></body></html>

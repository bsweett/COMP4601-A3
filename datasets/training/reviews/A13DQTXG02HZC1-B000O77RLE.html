Who would have thought that Clint Eastwood betters himself every year in the craft of movie making? I have to say that "Letters from Iwo Jima" is sublime.  For audience who have watched the American side in "Flag of our Fathers", this offering is able to fill some holes in the first movie. Whilst the first movie is more intense in battle scenes, this second movie goes the other way.  It focuses more on intimate scenes of Japanese soldiers hiding in underground caves and trenches to conduct guerilla warfare similar to ones used by VietCong during Vietnam War writing letters to their loved ones.  Here, we could understand why the Japanese lost the battle even before it had begun.  Most Japanese officers were deeply entrenched in the belief of death before dishonour and they would opt for gungho showdown rather than conserving resources to fight via element of surprises. Watanabe Ken is fabulous as the worldly General who'd been ordered to lead the Japanese side when most of his officers were disagreeing and disobeying his orders anyhow.  He's protrayed as a humane General who would perform his duty with courage, dignity and integrity despite of his yearning to go home safely to his family.  As Japanese force was severely depleted, there weren't any reinforcement and resources left to complement his strategies to undermine the American side.  Compounded by mass suicide of his soldiers as ordered by mutinied officers, he's fighting a losing battle and he knew it.  Audience bonded with two reluctant soldiers, Saigo  who was originally a baker & was coerced to become a soldier when the numbers were running thin; Shimizu, an ex-Kempeitai (akin to German's much feared Gestapo) who was sent to Iwo Jima because he wasn't tough enough.  They were torn between responsibilities to their Emperor & their country versus their longing to return home safely to their families.  There, there's also Nishi, an Olympic horsejumper who in his heydays would host party for Mary Pickford & Douglas Fairbank and who would volunteer himself to serve his country and a humanist officer; Ito, an inflexible militant akin to Tojo Hideki who would order his troops to their deaths just to win the battle. Here, we witnessed Americans soldiers gunned down Japanese soldiers even though they surrendered themselves, Japanese officers killing their own kinds just because they opted not to fight anymore, how some captured American soldiers were treated humanely in captivity by Japanese and some would be bayonetted & tortured cruelly. Certain scenes were deeply disturbing such as suicides with grenades, flamethrowers that gobbled everything and everyone along their paths. This is where war raises its ugly head and the time when we contemplate and asking why there need to be war at the first place.  It's ironic having a war movie suggesting an anti-war message.  This monochrome movie concludes rightfully with sunrise in glowing orange suggesting that the worst's over and a better promise & hope for future generations.  As read in the book, Ken's character ended up committing hara-kiri whilst to make it poetic in this movie, he used a pistol to kill himself that's been gifted to him during his stay in America.  An unmissable experience and an unforgettable movie. It's very rare a movie would give me lumps in my throat and what a sight to witness to see so many teary faces and people being contemplative in the cinema as end credit rolls.  Keep up the good work, Clint!</p></body></html>

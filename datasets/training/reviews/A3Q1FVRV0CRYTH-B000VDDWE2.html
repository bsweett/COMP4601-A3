Yes, I said silly.  Not the event of the next global warming / ice age...thats not too rediculous...it's the father trying to save his son part that's stupid.  ANYWAYS!!!  Watch it for the tornadoes destroying LA and the tidalwave destroying New York and the scene with the wolves in the ship is pretty neat.  The acting is sub-par...These actors have done much better elsewhere...just watch Jack in Brokeback or even Good Girl and Dennis in Far From Heaven.  Anyways, like I said, the one reason to see this is for the CGI graphics and 'intence peril' as the box puts it.</p></body></html>

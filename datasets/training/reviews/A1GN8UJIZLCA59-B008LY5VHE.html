<meta name="summary" content="Finally On DVD"></head><body><p>Jaws was Stephen Spielberg's first hit and after his initial reluctance to release his movies on DVD, it finally makes its DVD debut.  We all know the story, a great white shark terrorizes the waters off of Amity Island. The  movie is based on Peter Benchey's best-selling novel.  This is one of the  rare instances where a movie is actually better than the book it was based  on.  In Mr. Benchey's novel, there is are some extraneous sections such as  an affair between Ellen Brody and Hooper that really don't add to the  story.  The movie streamlines the book and the changes made bringing it to  the screen actually improve on the book. The performances of three stars  are superb.  Roy Scheider plays Chief Brody as an everyman.  We can all  relate with him as he is just trying do his job and the right thing but is  caught in the middle.  He wants to close the beaches to catch the shark,  but the people he is protecting want them opened as the water is the source  of their livelihoods.  Richard Dreyfus adds some comic relief to the film  as the wise-cracking oceanographer, Matt Hooper.  The late Robert Shaw  takes what could have been a cartoonish role of the shark boat captain  Quint and turns him into an obessive, vengeful man in the mold of Captain  Ahab.  The real star of the film could be its score by John Williams.  The  music adds tension and fear to the suspense much like the music from  Psycho.  The DVD contains some extra material including deleted scences,  trailers and best of all a documentary on the making of the movie.  This is  a must see for all fans of the film.  We learn of all the problems the crew  experienced while filming on Martha's Vineyard, some original casting  choices and other behind-the-scences tidbits.  These are nice bonuses, but  the movie's first appearance on the DVD format is reason enough to buy it.  After 25 years, this movie remains a classic.</p></body></html>

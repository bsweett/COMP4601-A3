Well, I was exactly right. The only different thing that I wasn't expecting is that the teenagers are hunted by inbred killers in the woods and mountains of West Virginia. While this premise is far from original, it is the mutant inbreds who make the film.<p>In the opening credits, the audience gets bombarded with images of missing people as well as news articles about mutation. We never quite understand if these mutation articles have anything to do with the killers in the film or if they were just used as a foundation for what we were about to see. <p>In the film, a group of teenagers and a doctor get into a wreck and must find help in the desolate woods. They split up, of course, and then people start dying at the hands of the cannibalistic killers. Overall, the story isn't that great, but there is a lot of gore and plenty of gross-out moments throughout.<p>Eliza Dushku, once again, plays the &quot;tough chick&quot; in the film. It seems as though she's becoming typecast. It would be nice to see her in a different role.<p>&quot;Wrong Turn&quot; is an okay film. I wouldn't suggest it, mainly because there are many other films with this storyline that are much better. However, fans of this genre might want to check it out and compare.</p></body></html>

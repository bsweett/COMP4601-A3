How brilliant, sensual, fantastical and wonderful the movie is, yet, it all distills to one theme...which you'll have to find out in the end.<br /><br />The brilliance of the colors and the stunning canvas is far more captivating than the action in the story itself.  Definitely worth watching.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Yes, "Dark" Is The Word For This Eerie & Fascinating Tale"></head><body><p>*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />"Dark" is right: this is a dark movie with dark people and dark buildings where there is no daylight until the very end of the story. It's a combination sci-fi/film noir and takes place back in the 1940s or '50s in some big city.<br /><br />A quick note on the Blu-Ray: it's 15 minutes longer with mostly developmental scenes from the early part of the movie added.  The transfer is excellent, too, so it is definitely worth the purchase.<br /><br />Story-wise, it's the usual alien nonsense but with some interesting twists you certainly haven't seen in other movies, like the city re-shapes itself every night.<br /><br />Because of that, the set designs and special effect are unique. I know of no other movie, before or since (it's been 10 years), which shows a city with buildings expanding, rising, falling, etc. The visuals throughout this movie are fabulous and the sounds that go with it are good, too.<br /><br />There is very little profanity in this movie but it's still a somewhat ugly, sordid story.  Yet - at least with me - it draws you back for multiple viewings. There is a magnetism to this film. This is the only video I got rid of twice and re-acquired it both times....and then bought it a third time when this expanded Blu-Ray disc came out....and I'm glad I did. This is one more fascinating films of past decade.</p></body></html>

Raised by one of the older elves, Buddy has no idea that he is actually human until he overhears some of the other elves talking in reference to his decreased productivity at toy-making when compared to the other elves (he builds 85 Etch-a-Sketches an hour while the genuine elves can build a thousand). Buddy decides to go back to his roots and find his human relatives, but is distraught when he's told that his real father is on Santa's naughty list. Still, he sails off on an iceberg from the North Pole bound for New York City.<br /><br />Elf is hilarious as only Will Ferrell movies can be.  When Buddy finds a department store Santa Clause pretending to be the real deal he tells him, "You sit on a throne of lies."  This movie is full of great one liners and watching it is a great way to get in the mood for the holiday season. I'd highly recommend it as a funnier alternative to some of the old classics like Christmas Vacation and A Christmas Story, or simply to supplement your holiday movie library.</p></body></html>

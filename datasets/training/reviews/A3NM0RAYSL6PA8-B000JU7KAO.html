I felt as if I'd walked out of someone else's surreal dream. (My children, 14 and 16, strongly disliked the movie. One of them poked me in the arm and said, "Lazy writing." Maybe we've talked about one too many films at my house.)<br /><br />So here's the multi-part deal.<br /><br />First, it's as if M. Night Shyamalan reviewed every book on screenwriting (actually, story writing generally), came up with a consolidated list of all the rules, and then consciously and studiously broke most (if not all) of them. Many of them are basic, and some of his approaches are genuinely cringe-worthy. For example, serendipity plays a huge role in this movie. The main character hears an otherworldly young woman mention that she's a "narf," happens to go to a Korean woman (who happens to live right upstairs) and asks her to look up a narf, she coincidentally recalls that her mother told her a bedtime story about narfs, and then we're off to the races. It turns out that her mother knows EVERYTHING about narfs -- and that this bedtime story she recalls becomes increasingly complicated to accomodate the movie's plot. Paul Giamatti's character (played with great earnestness) keeps going back to this Korean lady -- again and again and again -- to get more and more information about "narfs," "scrunts" (sheesh, my kids couldn't stop laughing over that word), a "Great Eatlon" (just a big eagle), and the "tartufics" (evil monkeys made of branches).<br /><br />Second, the movie depends on a fictional mythology that isn't terribly consistent -- with more than its share of contradictions and confusion. That's annoying, especially so, I think, for kids. My normally "quiet in the theater kids" kept nudging me with stuff like, "Hey! I thought they couldn't do that!" or "I thought anyone who sees those dies!" Frankly, after the exquisite and seamless logic of The Sixth Sense (which ranks among my favorite movies), Shyamalan's been on a downhill slide (although Signs was even more inconsistent and illogical than Lady in the Water).<br /><br />Third, the dialogue for some of the characters is either wooden (the Village-like lines of Bryce Dallas Howard are a good example) or mockingly stereotypical (Cindy Cheung, as a young Korean woman). I couldn't help but think of a Calgon commercial whenever the Korean characters spoke or interacted. That's bad.<br /><br />Fourth, Shyamalan's presence in the movie as a significant character (a writer whose work is so profound it will change the world, no less) was disturbing to me as a viewer.  First, his acting leaves much to be desired. Second, it breaks the plane of the story as an ever present reminder of the authorship, and as a personalization of the drama that seems especially out-of-context in a story full of symbols, metaphors, and mystical themes. It makes the movie feel more like Shyamalan giving a speech than telling us a bedtime story (which, apparently, was the genesis of the film). I expect that, for this very reason, few directors and writers ever appear as more than momentary cameos in their films. It puts them ahead of the story and the art, and that's rarely, if ever, a good thing. This, coupled with a thinly-veiled swipe at movie critics ("Cads! How could they know what's in someone's heart??? How arrogant!" or words not far off from that) suggest an author who is so mad he can't restrain himself, and had to jump into the movie to add punch to the attack.<br /><br />Okay, so why did I give this a three?<br /><br />Well, there's a sentimental side of me to which this movie appealed. The theme of this movie is that there is more to this world than is spoken of in science and secular philosophy (to paraphrase the Bard), and that each of us are part of a grand morality play (of sorts) in which each person's role has meaning. In other words, our lives have meaning of some kind. That theme appeals to a middle-aged guy.<br /><br />In addition, there is something interesting about the "form" of this movie. Although it has a splash of Matrix-sequel-style obtuseness and Terry Gilliam-esque oddness, Lady in the Water is a pretty original animal as far as films are concerned. It's odd, ideosyncratic, dream-like (as if a straight feed from the subconscious) and very personal. In fact, it's downright voyeuristic in tone -- as if we're listening in on some dad (who is a colorful, but not great spinner of yarns) telling his beloved children a load of nonsense at bedtime. And, in that nonsense, there is a grain of unspoken truth: that the world is weird, strange, and full of the "mystery of the ordinary" as one of the characters puts it in an "on the nose" line they warn you about in screenwriting books. In a "reality" of thugs, terrorists, and mothers drowning their kids, among other horrors, Shyamalan's odd world of vicious monkeys that keep the peace, delicate young women full of strange and wonderful knowledge, ordinary people with extraordinary skills, and giant eagles is a welcome respite. For all of its failures, and if we take off the armor of cynicism and sarcasm that we all seem to be wearing of late, it's pleasant fare.<br /><br />In the end, Lady in the Water has, for me, the feeling of a solo effort in which the writer/director/star made very little effort to consider or incorporate the thoughts and opinions of others.  There are, obviously, both good and bad points to such an approach, but few people possess a sufficiently wide range of talents, abilities, training, and life experiences to take on three such critical roles in one project and create something well-crafted, immersive, and accessible to the audience. Shyamalan isn't there yet, but I'm glad he's trying -- pushing the studio envelope and our expectations.</p></body></html>

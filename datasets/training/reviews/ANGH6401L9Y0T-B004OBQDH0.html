But I'd waited long enough already, so when Amazon offered a pre-release reservation, I ordered it.<br /><br />It may be discounted because this one did not do quite so well at the box office as the earlier films. It's dark, in both senses of the word. But then more people died in "Half-Blood Prince" than in this one. Still, the good guys are really up against it now, since the Death Eaters have taken over the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron & Hermione don't even try to go to Hogwarts for what would have been their senior year. They have far more important work: finding and destroying the rest of the Horcruxes that will strip Voldemort of his immortality and allow Harry to kill him. In effect, he is killing one part of Voldemort every time he destroys a horcrux. But it's not easy to find them, and not easy to destroy them.<br /><br />The Deathly Hallows are three magical objects mentioned in "Tales of Beedle the Bard," and I have a copy of that book. They include a wand which is more powerful than any other, the "Elder Wand," which is suffused with dark magic. It is stolen from the former owner by killing him. There is a stone which can bring the dead back to life, but they are not happy being zombies and it goes badly. Finally, there is a cloak of invisibility. In the story, that's the only one that worked out well.<br /><br />Since this movie is just half of the last book, I wondered where they'd cut it off. I won't do a spoiler, but just say it was a good choice. However, I am now inspired to go back and read the book again, and get a better sense of what was changed and what was left out. I get the distinct impression the first half hour or so has most of the differences.</p></body></html>

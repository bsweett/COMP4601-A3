A great film!"></head><body><p>Sean Penn won an Oscar for his outstanding performance in this 2008 film.  No wonder.  He is simply magnificent.  And, in my opinion, the film is a winner in every category.  Not only does it tell the true story of the man himself, Harvey Milk, who, in 1977 was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and was the first openly gay elected official in America, it is the story of a movement and a time and a place in history that defined a watershed of change.<br /><br />Bravo to the filmmakers!  The casting is perfect with James Franco playing the long-time boyfriend of Harvey Milk and Josh Brolin cast in the role of a troubled fellow city supervisor, who in an insane frenzy, brutally murdered both Milk and the Mayor of San Francisco, George Moscone in 1978.<br /><br />We first meet Milk, a 40-year old New York businessman, who changes his life dramatically by embracing the counter-culture movement and moving to San Francisco in the early 1970s with his young lover.  They live in the Castro district, which is fast becoming a Mecca for gays, opening a camera store and fighting the establishment.  Soon, Milk becomes political, running for public office.  He loses, not once but twice, but, finally, when he changes his hippie appearance and starts to wear suits, he eventually is elected.  He fights vigorously for gay rights, influencing gays to unite and "come out of the closet" and mostly, because of his activism and his strong  personality, a proposition to keep gays from teaching in public schools, promoted by the gay-bashing activist, Anita Bryant, was defeated.<br /><br />Sadly, Harvey Milk served a mere 11 months in office before he was assassinated.  But the changes he brought about are living on as the concept of inclusion is a reality in our culture today.  The cinematography and direction are exceptional and there is not a dull moment in the film.  I loved every minute of it. Hooray for Harvey Milk!  And Hooray those who brought his inspiring story to the screen!<br /><br />This film gets my highest recommendation.  Don't miss it!</p></body></html>

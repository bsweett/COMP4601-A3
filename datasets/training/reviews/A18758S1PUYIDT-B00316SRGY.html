<meta name="summary" content="Hard to watch, provocative, and fearless"></head><body><p>Spoilers.....<br /><br />Many parts of this story are hard to watch--there's a brutal Hmong gang which does terrible things even to their leader's own family members.  The subject matter is very provocative, as it pertains to a crusty old Korean war veteran who must learn to live with his Hmong neighbors in the deteriorating suburbs of a Michigan city.  A young man is burned with a cigarette, and his sister is gang-raped.  It ends up in a showdown between Eastwood and the dangerous and deadly gang.<br />There is no easy way out of this mess and no clear-cut solution. This is why I call it fearless.  There is no totally happy ending here where everyone finally learns to get along and live happily ever after.  Thank goodness--we get too much of that dreck already.<br />It's not easy viewing, but it is worth consideration.</p></body></html>

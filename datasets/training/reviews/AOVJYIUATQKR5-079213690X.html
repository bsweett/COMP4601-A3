<meta name="summary" content="Amazing movie and fairly accurate."></head><body><p>This is the "based on fact" story of a Scotsman who rallied some of the clans to fight a brutal english King.  The film captured the politics of the times.  The battle scenes are awesome.  The manner in which Wallace was betrayed and killed is based on fact, and the film does capture some of the brutality on his death.  The sad fact is that this kind of brutality existed then.  Many of the famous "victors" treated their enemies the same way.  Alexander the Great was known to slaughter and torture.  In our present day we have Sadam Hussien and his sons.<p>When I first saw this movie I wasn't aware that it was based on the real life of a scottish patriot named william wallace. I saw it with friends and all my friends laughed when I speculated that it had the feel of real history. One of my degrees is history, but this was in almost medieval times, not my emphasis. Ticked that my friends laughed I researched and discovered the truth. I was correct. Even the part about what drove Wallace (the murder of his wife) to be a fanatical leader is based in fact.<p>Somehow knowing that this movie was based on fact stirs the blood even more. Why? Because if it was fiction, ones reaction to events is very different.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well-made Bloody Gore Fest!"></head><body><p>The Devil's Reject is surprisingly entertaining and captivating horror rollercoaster ride experience. It has loads of blood and gore and the characters are pretty nasty. The Sheriff character is well depicted and played by William Forstyn. He's kind a combination of good and bad, the role could've been played by Tommy Lee Jones. The Firefly family members include the clown father, the son, the daughter, and the dirty mouthed captured mother are very disturbing and intense characters. Watching them in this movie reminded me of characters played by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis in Natural Born Killers. I actually enjoyed this film more than other similar films such as Saw and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The special feature's production documentary is also worth checking out.</p></body></html>

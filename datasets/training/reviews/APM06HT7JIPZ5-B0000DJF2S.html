<meta name="summary" content="This Movie Is GREAT!  I Loved It!"></head><body><p>Why the heck does everybody hate this movie so much?!  I am completely stumped at why this is so.  LXG was definitely the most underrated film of 2003 (along with HULK and THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS), and it deserved much better than it got.  One reason why I enjoyed this movie so much was because it's that kind of adventure we never get anymore: the Fantasy Adventure.  You know, like the INDIANA JONES trilogy, or THE MUMMY.  The very concept of mixing all these historic figures of literature and legend together I found very intriguing.  I've heard fans of the comic say that the movie completely destroyed what the comic did so well.  Well, since I've never even seen a single comic of LXG, the movie worked exceptionally well for me.<p>I was so pleasantly pleased after watching LXG.  From all the horrible reviews it received, I wasn't expecting very much.  Just a big, dumb, stupid comic book movie.  Well, let me tell you, my expectations were completely blown away!  THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN is, in fact, a very well-done film, from the fine acting of its stars &amp; supporting cast, the awesome production design, the fantastic and mood-setting/tone-matching music by Trevor Jones, and the very treatment of the characters.  They're obviously altered from their original forms, but the actors and events never go so far as insulting the characters.  Rather, the film brings the heroes into new ground, and provides each one with new twists.  I found each of these twists highly entertaining (yes, even the turban-sprouting, kung-fu practicing Captain Nemo; I though it was fascinating how they showed him worshipping the god of death).  And of course, you have Sean Connery: THE MAN.<p>Thankfully, director Stephen Norrington did a much better job with this than he did with BLADE.  I hear that he's going into independent films now, so knowing that, watching this film made it all the more interesting.<p>Do yourself a favor and don't bother listening to the critics.  But don't go in expecting LORD OF THE RINGS, either.  Instead, go in expecting THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN to be a marvelous piece of entertainment, sure to become a cult classic as time goes by.  It's the perfect thing for a Saturday night!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Indy on DVD!"></head><body><p>First, a review for each film.<br /><br />Raiders of the Lost Ark -<br /><br />Don't like snakes?Like making things up as you go along?Think all things archeological belong in the museum?Then Indiana Jones is the man for you!This has to be one of the funnest, funniest madcap adventure romps of ALL time.Harrison Ford is superb as the seat-of-your pants archeologist who falls out of the frying pan into every fire in the book.(and on top of it all, he's absolutely yummy to look at!)From evil Third Reich goons to disreputable rivals, old flames to smitten students, Professor Jones runs you through the gamut, leaving you breathless trying to keep up with him.A MUST SEE for anyone who likes their action fast furious and non-stop.<br /><br />The Temple of Doom -<br /><br />I don't know what critics are talking about when they say that this film doesn't compare to the first and third film. Not only is the action better, but there was more special effects. To me this darker second film, is the best of the triogy. Just like the "Empire Strikes Back" of the "Star Wars" saga. I suggest you go  and watch the second film "The Temple of Doom", and you will see that this film has more thrills,chills,laughs, and action then the other two installments.<br /><br />The Last Crusade -<br /><br />Harrison Ford and Sean Connery form an excellent team in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. I laugh every time I watch it. It is very comical and contains an excellent plot. I have so many favorite scenes I can't name them all.<br /><br />As for the DVDs -<br /><br />You already know about the films, so I'm gonna tell you about the fourth disc.<br /><br />All of the extras in this box set are found on the fourth disc. Unfortunately, Steven Spielberg nixed the idea of including such things as deleted scenes on this set, and despite requests from producer and pal George Lucas, he also elected not to record audio commentary. So what does that leave extras-wise? Well... you get a documentary, four featurettes, trailers for all three films and a DVD-ROM weblink. That's disappointing at first. But once you start watching the documentary, I think you'll find your disappointment will soon be forgotten.</p></body></html>

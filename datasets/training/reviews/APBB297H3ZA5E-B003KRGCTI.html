Bottomline: the most incredulous of storylines but ok acting... but again, the story just doesn't make any logical sense... unless your half awake at 0300.  Yea, I know Denzil Washington is in it, it has to be good; that's what I thought and that's why I viewed this film.  After I watched this DVD, my thought was then "what in the world possessed Denzil to make this film?"  Bottomline: skip it.</p></body></html>

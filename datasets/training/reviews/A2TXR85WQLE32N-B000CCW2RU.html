<meta name="summary" content="A Great Escape..."></head><body><p>2005's Sci-Fi thriller "The Island" features Ewan McGregor as Lincoln Six-Echo and Scarlett Johansson as Jordan Two-Delta, residents of a high-tech facility in which "special" humans are sheltered from "contamination" in an unseen outside world.  The residents lead a simple regimented life like overgrown school children; their health, diets, and activities are closely monitored, and they are discouraged from asking questions.<br /><br />Lincoln Six-Echo develops an unhealthy curiosity in the outside.  On a fateful excursion through a service tunnel, he discovers the residents are "product", living tissue banks paid for by wealthy clients of a bio-tech corporation.  He and Jordan Two-Delta make a break for the outside, just ahead of ruthless armed mercenaries sent by the head of the corporation (Sean Bean in full-on doctor with a god-complex mode).<br /><br />The long, breathless escape sequence at the core of the movie is filled with exciting stunts and astonishing special effects.  The struggle of Lincoln Six-Echo and Jordan Two-Delta to adapt to an unfamiliar world is the source of some humor and a touching bonding experience.  Their escape will, however, lead them to tough choices.<br /><br />"The Island" gets off to a slow start before going into stunt overdrive.  This reviewer wishes two superb actors had spent less time running and been given more time to explore.  "The Island" is highly recommended as an interesting, exciting and entertaining sci-fi movie experience.</p></body></html>

It was in this collection of sci-fi stories that Isaac Asimov introduced his three laws of robotics, which define for a robot its interactions with humans.  These three laws were the basis for the 2004 film's story, not the collection of short stories themselves.  This undoubtedly left left many theater patrons who have read Asimov's works disappointed with the film because unlike the short stories, the film's plot is built around a human character named Del Spooner (Will Smith), who is a technophobic police detective.  The film opens in the year 2035 with the apparent suicide of a brilliant scientist whose work in robotics has made the fictional company of "U.S. Robotics" more powerful than Microsoft could ever hope to have.  Called upon to investigate the suicide, Del Spooner personally knew the dead scientist, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell, who played Dr. Zefram Cochrane in the 1996 "Star Trek VIII: First Contact").  However, Del's mistrust of technology, and especially robots, puts him at odds with the CEO of U.S. Robotics, Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood), who instead has him speak to one of Dr. Lanning's associates, Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan).  While investigating Dr. Lanning's office at U.S. Robotics (where he is believed to have flung himself through a window), Del & Susan are startled when an NS5 robot named Sonny (Alan Tudyk) leaps from its hiding place.  Del is convinced that Sonny murdered Dr. Lanning, but no one believes him since that would violate the three laws of robotics that are programmed into every robot.  Further, such a situation would be highly embarrassing for U.S. Robotics, which is planning to release its new NS5 robots for use by the general public, who currently use the earlier NS4 models.  Undeterred, Del continues his investigation, but someone clearly doesn't like what he is doing as NS5 robots start to attack him.  The only question is who?<br /><br />Having read so many poor reviews for "I, Robot", I was pleasantly surprised by the film upon having the opportunity to view it myself.  The special effects and cinematography are quite good, and the story itself, which was written by Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman, is entertaining even though it is not an actual Asimov work.  I do highly recommend the documentary included on the DVD that explains the making of "I, Robot". It was quite interesting to see how the robots in the film were created through a combination of live actors and CGI.  Though I understandably cannot necessarily recommend the film to Asimov purists, overall, I do rate "I, Robot" with 4 out of 5 stars.  People familiar with the 1994 film "The Crow" and the 1998 film "Dark City" will no doubt recognize director Alex Proyas' handiwork with "I, Robot".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Instant Classic Dark Comedy"></head><body><p>IN BRUGES is the best movie I've seen so far this year.  Granted, I've seen very few 2008 films, but the reality is that there have not been many that I've had a desire to see.<br /><br />Written and directed by Martin McDonagh, IN BRUGES is a quirky, totally unpredictable dark comedy that stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as a pair of Dublin hit men, who are sent to the small Belgium city by their crime lord boss (Ralph Fiennes) to hide out after their last contract killing goes terribly wrong.<br /><br />Gleeson becomes very touristy, wanting to savor everything about Europe's most well-preserved medieval city, but Farrell is totally bored until he encounters a Dutch film crew and a couple of people involved with the shoot.<br /><br />I'm not going to reveal any more details about the story, because I don't want to spoil its many surprises.<br /><br />IN BRUGES is, essentially, a gangster movie, but unlike so many other pictures of this genre, its characters are endowed with a humanity that allows them to change for the better.  Like the plot, writer-director McDonagh's dialogue is refreshingly witty.<br /><br />The DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment has deleted scenes, a gag reel and "Behind the Scenes" featurettes, including one on the film's extensive profanity.<br /><br />?

Bush from a rather funny (and quite often, accurate) point of view.  From his early days when he first met Laura at a party, to his constant disagreements with his father, to the constant comparison to his brother Jeb, to his early campaign trails, to his eventual presidency of the United States.  W. covers this territory pretty well.<br /><br />Now here's how the movie works- while *those* events are taking place, quite often the story will switch in a different direction that shows the events (portrayed by characters, of course) where Cheney, Powell, Condoleezza Rice and the rest of the gang were discussing the best strategies concerning the war in Iraq.<br /><br />All the characters were convincing in their roles, not to mention really *do* resemble their real life counterparts.  Just look at them and try telling me they don't look and act almost exactly like them.<br /><br />What's especially strange about W. is how it shows George Bush as someone who doesn't seem like he has the dedicated desire (or the intelligence level) to eventually become president of the United States.<br /><br />This means Bush comes off looking rather odd because he's portrayed as someone who definitely wants to change the world and someone who is definitely passionate about doing so (and as we know, he does eventually achieve his dream of becoming US president) but the storyline develops in a way that makes it look like *anyone* can accomplish the same incredible goal, which is honestly not true at all.<br /><br />Then again, maybe that's the point.  Maybe the point is that the writers were trying to make Bush appear like an average man from the get go.  That way we can see how flawed he really is.<br /><br />Anyway, the political arguments dealing with the war in Iraq and the oil supply were interesting in the beginning, but because they are portrayed quite accurately, the only thing these scenes really did for me was allow me to remember the past 8 years.  So for me, the strong point of W. were the humorous segments that focused on how George Bush eventually got into office and less on the Iraq war.<br /><br />W. is a good trip down memory lane with a bit of humor thrown in (especially whenever Bush tries to say something intelligently and ends up stuttering and saying something half-witted- this happens a LOT).  It combines the real life situations with a touch of the fictional pretty well... at least, I assume certain parts are fictional.</p></body></html>

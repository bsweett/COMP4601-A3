The classic fish-out-of-water tale gets the Star Trek treatment as the intrepid crew heads to 20th century San Francisco so that they can look silly. Director Leonard Nimoy, who also helped develop the story, spares no one in his none-to-subtle &quot;save the whales&quot; movie.<p>Star Trek has always been great when they take social issues of today and transform them into a science fiction realm. This one translates the science fiction into the social issue of today, with mixed results. Everyone is given something to do, unfortunately, that helps to point up the lack of ability many of the original crew possess acting wise.<p>A good movie, witty but not subtle.</p></body></html>

"28 Days Later" is a genre-defying film wrapped in a shoebox budget. The key to keeping the sci-fi horror genre alive is to make sure the material and techniques the filmmakers present is at least competent, at it's average creative, and at it's best something that we haven't seen before or haven't seen in such a style or form. George A. Romero did that back in prime of film-making, bringing forth one of the most memorable trilogies of all time for the genre. While many consider Romero to be the A- listed director of horror films, it is important to know that he too had his sources for his little independent film in 1968, and after that was when he really got inventive, resulting in a masterpiece and a lackluster. Director Danny Boyle and author Alex Garland know that if they were to cook up a yarn all too similar to Romero it wouldn't be satisfying. So, they've done what is essential to the success of "28 Days Later"- they take ideas that have been in practice for many years, turn them fresh, and as the audience we feel repelled, excited, terrified, nauseous (perhaps), and enthralled, but we won't leave feeling like we've seen complete hack work.<br /><br />The lab scene at the beginning is a decent introduction. I like this explanation of where the virus came from considering real life viruses such as AIDS supposedly came from chimps. I also found it a much more believable reason for a apocalypse type virus than in other movies, at least the virus didn't come in an asteroid or something. Unlike "Dawn of the Dead", they don't give you an explanation of where the virus came from. I also liked how there is a little more to the story than just fighting off zombies. Actually, most of the movie doesn't even involve fighting the off, most of it is them just talking (which makes the movie a bit slow at times). The movie introduces you to several well developed characters that you will really come to care for as the story progresses. You really are concerned over who may die, or what the group's fate will ultimately be. Basically, you will be drawn into their struggle for survival, as well as enjoying the lighter moments as the group bonds and becomes more like a small family. This film really had a number of intense moments especially the tunnel scene, the group had to work really fast on changing that flat tire before those red eyed, ban-shee screaming zombie's come at them. It was a refreshing change from the usual shuffling zombie gig, and the grisly reality of what to do with a bitten companion before they turn berserk, which was less than a minute, gets you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />A good number of viewers did not like the ending, but after all that these characters have been through it was nice to walk away from this film with some happiness and hope. Not everyone could have pulled off such an idea, but it works well here. In this film I saw some similarities in Romero and some other films (the military scenes reminded me of "Day of the Dead," though the chained up Zombie in this was done for more practical reasons, and the supermarket scene is a little unneeded considering the satirical reverence it had in "Dawn of the Dead"). But what they should understand is that Boyle isn't making a 100% original film, and no one could at this point of the genre's history. He has done, however, the most credible job he could in getting a different tone, a different setting in country, and of a different, enveloping view of the scene structures. Overall, "28 Days Later" is constructed and executed like most sci-fi horror films you've ever seen. I recommend this film to everyone who is old enough to see it because it's truly an artistic masterpiece that actually dares to have a point behind it!</p></body></html>

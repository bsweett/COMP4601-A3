I have watched this movie many times and it still isn't boring, that is the best thing that can be said about movie. That it has a long life and can still be enjoyed years after it's release, and X-Men definitely fits that category. But, what is not to like about this movie?<br /><br />The casting for it is perfect, Ian McKellen makes a great Magneto and Patrick Stewart makes a perfect Professor Charles Xavier. The same things can be said for everyone in the movie and who they were cast as in the film. It is done so perfectly, it adds to the story and makes me wonder if this movie would have been as powerful as it is if other people were cast in this film. Let's not forget the special effects that are used in this movie. That is definitely eye candy for sure. The mutant powers look great when they are used in this movie and look realistic. It is really cool to see Wolverine's adamantium claws first slowly come out in the bar.<br /><br />The story doesn't follow the comics as well as I had hoped they would. The biggest example I could see in the film is that Wolverine and Sabertooth don't know each other prior to their meeting in this movie, but in the comic, they have known each other for years. Despite the lack of being 100% like the comic, this movie makes a story of it's own and the previous story isn't really needed. It is so compelling in the way it is told, it can be forgiven for its very small mistakes for sure. This is definitely a have to see movie. If you haven't by now, you need to!</p></body></html>

Well seems even Nicolas Cage couldnt mess this movie up, he actually did a good job, the part fit him really well. The special effects are top notch. The extra footage, ok, and well placed. This is an enjoyable flick, even as a straight theatrical release. This release on Blu-ray did the movie justice. A worthy addition to any collection.</p></body></html>

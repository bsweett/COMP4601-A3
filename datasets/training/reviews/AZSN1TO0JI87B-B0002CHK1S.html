But neither is that thing...""></head><body><p>With each and every remake that Hollywood churns out, especially in the horror genre, there is always the hope that it will turn out at least half as well as John Carpenter's brilliant remake of "The Thing From Another World," simply retitled "The Thing." Much like David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of "The Fly," "The Thing" has earned cult status by being one of the few remakes in the history of film to not only improve upon the original, but make the general public forget it existed. It's that good! With top-notch special effects for it's time (1982!) and an isolated, ice-cold setting full of unsavory and suspicious characters, Carpenter crafted one of the creepiest and most original horror movies of the eighties and delivered some images that the viewer will likely never forget.<br /><br />Starring Kurt Russell, Wilford "Check Your Blood Sugar Often" Brimley, Keith David, and an oversized cowboy hat, "The Thing" revolves around a group of scientists hunkered down in Antarctica. Completely isolated and going stir-crazy within a matter of days, the group learns a new definition of cabin fever when an alien lifeform takes over the crew one by one. Unlike the alien in, say, "Alien," this one actually imitates whatever lifeform it infests, making it nearly impossible to tell who's who. As the men turn on each other, and as Russell's beard grows in thicker, you can literally feel the walls closing in and the mood turning darker and colder. Like all the good Carpenter flicks, this one is a slow-burner that gets you close to the characters before dispatching of them. And the way some of these folks are dispatched of can be downright gruesome! The special effects are marvelous and actually hold up today. It's enough to make even today's desensitized audience a bit squeamish. But even without the gore, Carpenter still has his suspense mastered. This is one horror film that is impossible to look or walk away from, because as the events unfold, everything gets more twisted and more shocking.<br /><br />Audiences in 1982 may of passed it by, but it has since then earned it's place in the Horror Hall Of Fame. Not only is it one of the best remakes ever, but it's also one of John Carpenter's finest films, and a brilliant bend on the alien invasion genre. Horror and sci-fi geeks will love it, and if you haven't experienced it yet, you're really missing out on a gem.</p></body></html>

He really knows how to set the tone before the story even begins, using  gray palettes as his overlay to create a somber and foreboding gloom over  landscapes and people. The art direction and cinematography in this film is  amazing, not only for the creepy and ethereal scenery but coupled with  interesting camera angles and long, focused shots on dream-like images.  <p>This is a film for all ages, just as &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; is,  and both films share the properties that make them great.<p>1)Johnny Depp.  This man has an incredibly mobile and almost comedic face, his expressions  endearing and farcical. Edward Scissorhands taught him a lot about putting  forth without uttering a single word because he had very few lines. He  relied more on his eyes than anything, and I have been impressed by his  talent for improvisation ever since. Ed Wood only secured that position. He  makes an impressive turn with his character here, playing the endearing,  faint-hearted Constable Ichabod Crane. His constant episodes of passing  out, turning up his nose at numerous corpses and consistent nervous  stutters make him a very enjoyable presence on-screen.<p>2)Child-like  fantasy. Ichabod's flashbacks about his mother include a sequence where she  twirls into the air, milkweed tuft floating around like a summer snowfall.  This is the beauty among the muck and blood in this film, and it captivates  viewers young and old who share a fascination with magic and mystery.  Burton may be a scholar in the area of gothic cinematics, but he has a  special and unmatchable ability for uplifting and mystical moments in his  films, a prime example in yet again &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, where  Winona Ryder twirls happily in circles while snowflakes fall slowly around  her, the choral music making the moment even more touching and  serene.<p>3)The special effects. I have to admit, this was a lot more  graphic than I expected, but it did the film justice. I loved all the blood  and the head-severing. If this is going to be classified as a horror film,  it has to have some of the winning traits that make it so. I am a horror  fan, and I thoroughly enjoyed the disgusting cadavers and consistent  decapitation. Burton doesn't have a history of graphic violence in his  films, but it worked out well for him in this one, combined with the  computer-animated Tree Of The Dead and restoration of the ghost's  skull.<p>And if this isn't enough to get you to watch this film, then watch  Edward Scissorhands first. That is a great starter film for anyone who  wants to get acclimated in the Burton film genre. If that movie doesn't  make you hungry to see this one, I don't know what will.</p></body></html>

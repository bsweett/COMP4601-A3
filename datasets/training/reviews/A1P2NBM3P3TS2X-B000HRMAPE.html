<meta name="summary" content="Instantly forgettable (and has elements of other movies in it)"></head><body><p>It has been a long time since Tom Cruise starred in a film where he wasn't just playing a jacked-up version of himself. With "MI3" the streak continues.  Tom never allows you to forget you are watching TOM CRUISE.  He mugs, he over-emotes, he flexes --- all the things that made him a matinee idol.  Does he act?  Not much, but films like this don't allow much room for that anyway.  One need not be a great actor to pull off a film like this.  One must only be a competent actor.<br /><br />Phillip Seymour Hoffman, however, is a dandy villain.  But he has a small role anyway, and movies like this tend to be showcases for the villains anyway.  They tend to be the only really interesting characters in these genre films.<br /><br />Cruise's Ethan Hunt character and his domestic ordeals are straight from the Unoriginal Screenplay Handbook.  Let's see here:  he has a fiancee (and eventually wife) who doesn't know what he does for a living.  She thinks he has a rather mundane job.  But horror of horrors, she finds out the truth when she is kidnapped by the baddies and hubby has to rescue her and she finds out the truth...<br /><br />Sound interesting?  Sure.  Sound familiar?  It should.  It was the central conceit in James Cameron's "True Lies" starring Ah-nold and Jamie Lee Curtis.  Twelve years ago.  And "True Lies" was a remake of a French film.  So "MI3" has key elements that were unoriginal 12 years ago.  Nice job.<br /><br />In "MI3" there is a chase of sorts on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.  Jets fire missles to destroy the bridge, cars explode, bridge sections collapse, etc.  Now where have I seen this before?  Oh yeah, in "True Lies".  Different bridge, same look, nearly the same general action give or take a plot element or two.<br /><br />Hope Jim Cameron at least got partial screenplay credit for this fim.<br /><br />Five years since "MI2" and this is the best they could do?<br /><br />I'm not saying that "MI3" and "True Lies" are the same film.  But "True Lies" was more exciting, more interesting, more layered, and more plot-driven.  "MI3" never really engages you for more than a few moments at a time.  Lots of cliched Hollywood emotional manipulation, too.<br /><br />A very by-the-numbers film.<br /><br />And at the end of the film, as a call-back to something tried earlier in the film with another character, Tom's character must allow himself to die temporarily with the hopes of being resuscitated later by his frantic wife.  Sound familiar?  Yep.  Reverse the gender roles and you have a scene from James Cameron's "The Abyss" from 1989.  In it Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio drowns herself so that her husband (Ed Harris) may live and hopefully resuscitate her soon after.  Frantically, of course.<br /><br />I first saw "MI3" in May of 2006.  But I saw major elements of it as far back as 1989.<br /><br />I guess the REAL Impossible Mission is to find a totally original screenplay.<br /><br />Minor quibble:  Billy Crudup's character shows up to meet with Ehtan Hunt at a convenience store and he has several days' goatee growth.  Then he gets Hunt to watch a video he made less than 8 hours earlier in which he is clean-shaven.<br /><br />Oh, and Crudup plays Cruise's boss and later betrays him.  Sound familiar?  From the first "Mission Impossible", maybe?  And also from "Minority Report" now that I think about it.<br /><br />I couldn't care less that Tom Cruise jumps up and down on Oprah's furniture, supposedly impregnates Katie Holmes, blasts the psychiatric profession, joined a cult, gets Comedy Central to yank "South Park" episodes from the air, or much else.  But with the kind of pull he has in Hollywood he should be able to insist upon making a better quality of film.</p></body></html>

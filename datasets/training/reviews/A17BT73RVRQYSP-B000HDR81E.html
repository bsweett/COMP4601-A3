<meta name="summary" content="Smart movie with a dose of real life"></head><body><p>This movie pulled me in two directions.  A good part of the start of the movie existed to establish Vince Vaughn's character as a smooth talking, lazy and selfish.<br /><br />As the picture progresses we see both leads spending all of their efforts trying to one up each other instead of trying to repair a relationship that they both care about.  It is a powerful lesson on how not to do things.  As the movie went deeper and deeper it was clear that both people didn't want to break up but also didn't want to give in.  They were more invested in what other people advised then it what they wanted themselves.<br /><br />As the movie progressed it became smarter and smarter.  About 2/3 of the way into the picture I whispered to my wife that if this movie was brave it would end a particular way.  Don't worry no spoilers.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise and my wife's disappointment when that in fact was the case.  As we left the theatre I made a note to notice the women leaving the picture, it looked like uniform disappointment.<br /><br />I think the ending make a potential sequel possible, but it would be a shame in a sense since one of the things that made the picture as smart as it was is the idea that actions have results.<br /><br />This picture is worth watching, see it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Tour de Force for John Cusack"></head><body><p>1408 is the latest screen incarnation from the mind of Stephen King, one of my favorite authors, and this time Hollywood has well-adapted a story of his.<br /><br />King has traveled down this chilling haunted hotel road before with his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743437497">The Shining</a> which was made into something of a minor classic by Stanley Kubrick; however, Kubrick's version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATQJ">The Shining</a> turned left at some point when it should have turned right.  This time Hollywood got it right with King and much is due to Cusack's powerful performance from beginning to end.<br /><br />This time instead of having a never believable as sane Jack Nicholson as a tormented writer attempting to exercise his personal demons and plunging into madness, we have John Cusack who actually is believable as a sane writer who just might be going insane after one hour in an "(expletive) evil room" according to the wonderfully understated but sinister seeming Samuel L. Jackson who attempts to convince Cusack not to enter the room by giving him teasing tidbits that would entice anyone to want to just see the room.  He practices an evil reverse psychology with Cusack's character, Mike Enslin, that works like a charm.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil this review with giving away the plot twists, but just when you think the film is over and all is resolved satisfactorily . . . well . . . it ain't!  Clever writing, camera movement, and a surprisingly low-budget approach really add to the over chilling effect of this film.  Of course, this film really doesn't belong to the brilliant mind of Stephen King, but rather to John Cusack's flawless performance.  Is it Oscar-nomination material?  No, not really, but it's brilliant nevertheless and in what is basically a one character and one location film, he must and does carry the film.<br /><br />This film is worth running out to see and worth purchasing when it comes out on DVD even though it loses its punch a bit when the mystery is solved.  Like M. Night Shyamalan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004BZIY">The Sixth Sense</a>, this film has excellent repeat value and will maintain its creepiness over multiple viewings even after the mystery is no longer a mystery.</p></body></html>

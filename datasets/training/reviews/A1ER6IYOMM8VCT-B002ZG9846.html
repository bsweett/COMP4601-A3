<meta name="summary" content="EASILY ONE OF THE GREATEST COMIC BOOK FILMS EVER MADE!"></head><body><p>I have wanted to see Kick-Ass ever since I saw the trailer over a year ago. What looked to be just another "by the numbers" sophomoric comedy turns out to be a brilliant and wickedly funny satire for adults.<br /><br />This film isn't going to appeal to everyone and I'm not here to insult anyone on either side of the fence. I enjoyed the film and I see nothing wrong with it. If you don't like it that's fine too and if you don't think your kids should see it, then don't let them, it wasn't intended for kids, but I do believe that trailer marketed it to look like a much more innocent film. The R rating should be enough warning for parents to get the idea that this film isn't for children.<br /><br />As far as the violence involving this young actress, I can remember many Little Rascal shorts that involved the rascals dragging adults across boards with nails in them or hitting them in the head with hammers etc, so this is not all that new to the world. I realize that this film shows violence that is way more graphic, but I also think we have become a little over sensitive and read way too much into everything these days.<br /><br />There were similar reactions to 'The Exorcist' and 'Pretty Baby' in their day and since Linda Blair and Brooke Shields seemed to have turned out OK I see no reason for such commotion. Everything is open to individual interpretation and depending on your age you may not realize that this has been going on since the early stages of filmmaking. I remember eight Shirley Temple vehicles called 'Baby Burlesks' she made before her wonderful feature films that portrayed 3 year olds as adults which I find much more alarming that this film.<br /><br />Now.....let's get to the movie. The casting is perfect with each of the four heroes having their own quirks and enough back story to propel this kind of film. Aaron Johnson plays the title character a Peter Parker type of nerdy school kid who without the aid of super powers decides he wants to fight crime. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays "Red Mist" another school nerd who's father happens to be a gangster boss. Nick Cage gives one of his best performances as "Big Daddy" an ex cop who was framed and jailed for 5 years and wants nothing more than to crush those responsible. He enlists the aid of his pint sized potty mouthed daughter Mindy A.K.A. "Hit Girl" played by Chloe Moretz who absolutely owns this film! Moretz shows incredible chops here not only as an actress, but as a stunt person, she performs almost all her own stunts and her performance is amazing. I know some see this kid's character as child exploitation, but really each child is different and some are more mature that others and it is her parents responsibility not mine to see to it she can handle such a role.<br /><br />While the film is extremely violent, it is portrayed much like in many comic books today which is a lot more disturbing than this film. I know that a lot of adults read comics, but comics are made for kids or at least that was their original intent, if comic books are going to have graphic violence, maybe there should be age restrictions on those too? I haven't seen an actual 'Kick Ass' comic book so I can't respond on how closely this movie portrays the comic, but I can tell you, this is easily one of the best comic book movies ever made.<br /><br />The Blu Ray combo pack has a slick looking transfer and plenty of behind the scenes features for fans. I hope that this Blu Ray DVD combo trend continues as I really like having both Blu Ray and DVD as I haven't fully committed to Blu Ray and it's nice to have both formats in case I want to watch this film as someone's home who doesn't have a Blu Ray.<br /><br />In Short Kick-Ass does just that all around!</p></body></html>

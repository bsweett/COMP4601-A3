But it felt way too slow for me, and disconcertingly unwilling to address anything beyond the minutiae of each defusing event. I never really got much chance to care for any of the characters, though there was some nice ironic humor. Mostly I wanted to be involved beyond the obvious will-it-blow-up tension, yet rarely was.<br /><br />I sure couldn't wait to see it, and rented the blu-ray the day it came out. It looks good, and Bigelow has a nice eye. But somehow it all felt oddly prosaic. No doubt this is a brutal job, and it's an interesting topic for a film, yet I never felt like I had a chance to get to know anyone here enough to care much about them. Perhaps that's the point?<br /><br />I was interested by the comments on the one and two star reviews here, and on other boards. Apparently a lot of EOD experts find this film annoyingly innaccurate, while many film fans point to that as unimportant; "film can take any liberty needed to tell its story". Agreed, but this sort of film seems married to technical accuracy, indeed prides itself on it, and it felt strange to see so many lives risked, American and Iraqi, by hotshot tactics based on the need for a thrill. Is this what it's really like? Army guys risk each other's lives all the time just to cop a rush? The little speech about that was one of the few times this film really gripped me, much more than the many isn't-this-a-tense-moment scenes, which wore on far too long. They felt overdone and trite, in fact.<br /><br />One thing that others liked, THL's apparently opjective tone, felt off to me. Yes, this is how these guys do this job (or is it? The EOD reviewers giving this low stars say it ain't, and they might know best). But this job only occurs when we decide to send our troops to other countries, and some of the people there don't want us around. Examining the details of defusing bombs while ignoring the reasons for those bombs being made seems somehow dishonest in a way. You can't separate those details any more than you can separate a cow's role in a hamburger, and completely ignoring why we're in Iraq felt forced and fake in spite of all the attempts to make this seem real.<br /><br />Maybe that's why this movie is so beloved; it absolves the viewer from thinking about the subtle issues in Iraq, and focuses on the life or death moments, stripped of the entire context for their coming into being. It's much easier for us to see Iraq as a job for our soldiers than ask ourselves: if we really love these soldiers, why are we putting them in the line of death every day, and what have we gained from their sacrifices? Instead we get a film that makes all that seem extraneous.<br /><br />You're telling me these disposal guys never discuss the reasons for their being there? I don't buy that. I felt more for the innocent Iraqi strapped with a bomb than I did for the guys trying to defuse it. They volunteered for this, and are getting paid for their service; no one made them enlist---the draft is long gone. Whereas the Iraqi is just dying for no reason at all. So who's the hero? One of the basic points of a good war film is that it's not whose side you're on that makes you a good guy; it's whether you are a good person, apart from your country's motives. This was touched on to some degree here, but ignoring all the War On Terror context didn't make sense to me, and made this film feel contrived in many ways.<br /><br />The low-starred reviews here tend to be from military personnel, and their thoughts are very interesting to read.<br /><br />Perhaps I need to watch Hurt Locker again. But on first viewing it just didn't grip me the way it did most everyone else. I wish it had! Apocalypse Now and a number of other war films are among my favorite movies, and I was hoping this one would be too. But there's not one character here that I really cared about, one way or the other, compared to my feelings about those films. I appreciated Bigelow's craft, but it didn't move me as it did others. Doesn't mean it ain't a great movie, just that it ain't my idea of a great movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Arnold against Predator!"></head><body><p>"Predator" (1987) is just a new Classic Thriller. So good it was that unavoidable sequel ensued. When I first saw this film at the theater I was fascinated. Such a good sci-fi movie is just a treat for buffs like me. Usually the genre provides lots of second rate stuff or in the other hand when they try to be "serious" they end just "pretentious".<br />In my own ranking "Predator" stands side by side with "The Terminator", "Blade Runner", "Alien", "Brazil" and "The Matrix".<br /><br />The story is as follows: a commando unofficial party penetrates a Centro-American jungle in a rescue mission. Things go mysteriously awry and the patrol finds itself deep in the jungle, followed by an invisible enemy and decimated one by one disregarding their overwhelming fire-power.<br />The film follows this wild chase with unfaltering skill giving place to high voltage anthological scenes as the final confrontation between a mudded Dutch, almost single-handed & the wounded, yet lethal, Predator.<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger gives his second best interpretation; of his early actor's career (IMHO the best was as The Terminator). His unflinching personification of the ex-Green Beret is paramount; he won't smile even in the final credits. It's amazing how an actor almost expressionless, as Arnold, will convey such stamina charged performance & captivate the audience.<br />The performance of the rest of the Team is far over standard characterizations, not one or two, all of them: Carl Weathers (best know as Rocky eternal rival Apollo Creed) fleshes a granite Special Agent, Bill Duke as powerful Mac, Jesse Ventura (now into politics as Arnold) performs as Blain, Sonny Landham is the monosyllabic Billy, Richard Chaves a suffering Poncho, Elpidia Carrillo is Anna the captured guerrilla and last but not least Kevin Hall is the Predator in person!<br /><br />Director John McTiernan shows his great ability & sense of rhythm  for full fledged action movies, as he will show more than once directing "Die Hard" (1988), "The Hunt of Red October" (1990) and "The 13th Warrior" (1999).<br />Cinematography in charge of Donald McAlpine is very good & special effects are outstanding!<br /><br />This is a recommended film for sci-fi and action film's fan.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Magical Fantasy with Mystery, Adventure, and Romance!"></head><body><p>This movie is powerful and effective and carries the viewer along on a ride that offers fantasy mystery with adventure and romance thrown in as extras. The settings and ambience leave little to be desired and establish an aura of romantic intrigue that compliments the outstanding acting on the part of the entire cast. The background music and surround sound never overpower the dialogue and the overall balance produces a highly effective movie that leaves the viewer wanting more.<br /><br />The characters are masterfully portrayed by the cast and help carry the viewer along as they experience the situations generated by the fascinating story of an individual who rises to the top of his profession as an illusionist but is in love with that unobtainable women who is the object of all he desires.<br /><br />This one is a keeper and is worthy of repeated viewings. I recommend it highly.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wayne and Ford"></head><body><p>Probably the Duke's greatest film.  A large scale epic of a quest by Ford with Wayne tracking his lost niece -- after Indians raid her home and kill her family.  Aided by Jeffrey Hunter, this a truly monumental motion picture and not simply one of the greatest westerns ever made.  Wayne's character is a man who truly loses everything -- best exemplified by the final scene.</p></body></html>

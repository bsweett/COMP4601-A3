Indeed, I was able to overlook the preposterous story, the cliche choices in setting and character, and the fact that every aspect of the plot was completely contrived. All that can slide in a comic book adaptation; it's meant to be fun, not meaningful. And true to its word, this is mindless entertainment at its purest. I also give it credit for being an incredibly good-looking film, with incredible special effects and entertaining stunts that are sure to please any action film buff. Top that off with the fact that this is a supernatural story, one that involves demons, the Devil, and yes, a man who transforms into a flaming skeleton. We now have a slight horrific edge, which makes the film that much more enjoyable.<br /><br />Still, I think that even a comic book adaptation should attempt to raise the bar in terms of performance and dialogue. The qualities of both elements are seriously lacking in "Ghost Rider," and that forces me to lower my ranking to three stars. It seemed like the actors were purposely lax, as if they lost interest because they were starring in such a stylized, unrealistic film. That's not the way it works. Even if the material is ridiculous, even if the characters are flimsy and over the top, a comic book adaptation still deserves decent performances. Nothing of the sort was given for this film; every line was so amateurish that they barely passed as laughable. Likewise, every character was underplayed, overdone, or just plain poorly acted.<br /><br />The most prominent example of this is Nicholas Cage; after five minutes of watching him perform in this film, it was hard to believe that it was the same Nicholas Cage who won an Oscar for "Leaving Las Vegas." He plays Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle daredevil with a lot of baggage. As a teenager (played by Matt Long), he sold his soul to Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) to save his father (Brett Cullen), who was dying of lung cancer. Unfortunately, he died the next day due to a failed motorcycle stunt (you guessed it; his father was also a daredevil). The reasoning is simple: curing the cancer was the only part of the deal. Furthermore, keeping him alive might spoil the Devil's future plans for Johnny. This is probably why he's been able to avert disaster as an adult; some of his stunts go horribly wrong, yet he always comes away unscathed. "You've got an angel looking after you," says Mack (Donal Logue), Blaze's manager. "Maybe it's something else," Blaze replies ominously.<br /><br />Yes, it is in fact something else. And now, it seems that Mephistopheles has finally found use for Blaze: he'll be turned into a Ghost Rider, a kind of demonic bounty hunter. By day, Blaze will be a normal man. But by night, in the presence of evil, he'll transform into a fleshless, flammable monster. His mission is to hunt the Devil's demon son, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), and his three cohorts. If Blaze succeeds, his soul will be set free. Why is this mission so important? Blackheart has recently escaped from Hell with the intent to find a missing contract, one that was signed by a greedy man 150 years ago in a remote western town. Apparently, another Ghost Rider was supposed to deliver it to Mephistopheles. But instead of delivering the goods, this rogue bounty hunter ran off, never to be seen again, denying the Devil a chance to possess a legion of evil souls.<br /><br />This is where Blackheart comes in. He has some issues with daddy, and it definitely shows through his immature teenager-like attitude. He hopes to resolve these issues by overthrowing his father, which can only be done if he's in possession of the contract. How exactly this would work is never adequately explained, but I suppose it doesn't matter. What does matter is that it makes for fine conflict with Blaze, which is a must in any such story of a dark superhero. And it makes for some really impressive computer generated imagery, especially in moments when Blaze is forced to transform. If you like watching people go up in flames, then you'll love this movie.<br /><br />The other side of the story involves Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes), who had a failed romance with Blaze back when they were teenagers. Today she's a news reporter: smart, ambitious, and needing an extra button for her conveniently revealing blouse. She takes the opportunity to reunite with Blaze during one of his acrobatic shows (involving jumping his motorcycle across six operational helicopters at a distance of 300 feet). Here's a subplot that could have been affective had it not been for Mendes' performance. It was awful, to be perfectly honest. It's bad enough having to deliver some of the film's worst lines. Example: she waits in a restaurant for Blaze to show up. To pass the time, she downs glass after glass of wine. When she's thoroughly drunk, she turns to her waiter and asks, "You think I'm pretty, right?" Yes, it's a dumb line, and it was made dumber because the line was delivered badly (oh, and in case you were wondering, Blaze doesn't show up; that happened to be the night of his first transformation).<br /><br />As Blackheart continues searching for the contract, Blaze has a chance meeting with a mysterious caretaker (Sam Elliott) who tends a middle-of-nowhere graveyard (coincidently, it's the same graveyard where Blaze's father is buried). He's a strange man who seems to know an awful lot about Blaze and his "condition," something the audience shouldn't find at all surprising; let's just say it's obvious right from the start who he really is. Anyway, he warns Blaze that he must stay away from family and friends. He also tells him to stay on graveyard property because Blackheart cannot step on hallowed ground (if only this were followed through; later on in the film, Blackheart stands inside a church, completely unaffected by it).<br /><br />Does Blaze listen? Of course not. He has a mission, one that he can't back out of. But will Blaze and Roxanne ever be able to rekindle an old flame (pun definitely intended)? Will the forces of evil be stopped before it's too late? Why am I even asking these questions? I can say that it all makes for great action sequences and shots of digital wizardry. If only it paved the way for an enjoyable film with enjoyable performances. "Ghost Rider" delivers in that it's visuals are spectacular. But the story is weak. The dialogue is substandard, as is the acting. How disappointing; such half-hearted attempts can only make a comic book adaptation difficult to engage. Someone must have made a deal with the Devil to get this film made. In time, I'm sure that that someone will pay the price.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great performances. Way too long."></head><body><p>It was pretty much the talk of the town after the film came out. That Jamie Foxx, the star of Ray, would win the Oscar. And sure enough, he won it. It is quite a performance but looking at the rest of the film, there's parts where it just unravels slightly and looks like a better editor needed to be on.<br /><br />Ray Robinson became blind at the age of 7 and had to grow up with not only a loving but kind of stern mother, he had to live with his brother's accidental drowning, since Ray froze and hesitated. He does become quite a piano player so we follow him as people take advantage a bit as he's in a club only to have the manager become his woman and have him being paid less than everyone else.<br /><br />He starts to come onto his own when he starts to marry rhythm and blues with gospel music(with the not unexpected outcries from religious people) and meets Della, who ends up becoming his wife and mother to his children. However, he's quite a womanizer and has some other women on the road. Not to mention he starts a heroin addiction.<br /><br />One thing that is quite a watch is seeing Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Ray Charles. Many people say he's channeling the late legend, but personally it's almost like he becomes the guy a good portion of the time that it practically looks eerie. Kerry Washington is quite good as the wife but her character is a bit unbelievable: she knows her husband has an addiction and has strayed yet she stays with him and doesn't really have that commanding "don't do that anymore" that wives like to do with their husbands. Regina King has one of his mistresses and backup singers, well I never did like her in any movies. She always seems to come off as bitchy and needy for some reason.<br /><br />The other issue I have is the dramatic license that tends to happen. Like the water scenes(you'll see what I mean). It seems a bit too over-the-top and too sappy, especially the rehab scene where he "confronts" his demons. Not to mention it's way too long.<br /><br />As for the music, there's no denying Ray Charles's talent but I just couldn't get to liking his music. That one song he plays after he just sleeps with Della for the first time is good but the rest of it I couldn't get into it. However kudos for putting in my 3nd favorite Beethoven piece Moonlight Sonata(first being Fur Elise and then Ode to Joy).<br /><br />It's way too long but watch it for the performance. He deserves that Oscar although he's by no means a flawless actor(he did do Booty Call after all).</p></body></html>

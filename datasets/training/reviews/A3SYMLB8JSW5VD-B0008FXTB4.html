The movie about shylock Chili Palmer who's burnout after the sequel to his movie was a bust. Decides to get into the music businesss after discovering Linda Moon played by Christina Milan who is terrific as a actress and singer. The cast of characters in this movie are terrific. But the standouts are Cedric the Enterainer and Andre of the group Outkast. Also the part when Uma Thurman and John Travolta dancing is great as well.</p></body></html>

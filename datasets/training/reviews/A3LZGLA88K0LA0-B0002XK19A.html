SPIDER-MAN 2 has everything a good movie should have:  a marvelous cast; superb direction; awesome and incredible effects; a great score; and a well written plot.  Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst give their characters a welcome sense of realness and one can't help but feel for them:  poor Peter can't be on time for anything; being Spider-Man interferes with everything in his life:  his job, his education, and most importantly, his relationship with Mary Jane.  Dunst meanwhile is not only stunning physically, but she is a darned good actress, giving Mary Jane just the right amount of naivete and spunk.  A supporting actor and actress nod should go to Alfred Molina and Rosemary Harris.  Molina is the perfect villain as the incredibly designed Doctor Ock!  He uses his impressive acting abilities to bring both compassion and hatred.  Ms. Harris is beautiful as Peter's Aunt May.  A seasoned theatrical and movie actress, Harris embodies the essence of paternal and familial love.  J. K. Simmons as Peter's editor boss is outrageously campy and brilliant.  James Franco as Harry gives a good performance, but his character is getting annoying and redundant---although it looks like he might be around as a villain in the third.<br /><br />The movie has breathtaking action scenes, including the one on the train, but all of them are mindboggling.<br /><br />SPIDER-MAN 2 is what moviemaking is all about and fun as hell to boot!  Bravo Sam Raimi!!!!</p></body></html>

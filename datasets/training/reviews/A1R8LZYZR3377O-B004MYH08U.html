What the heck is this movie? I knew it wouldn't be that good when I saw the trailer with Seth Rogen hamming it up. The lure for me was, hey, it's a superhero movie that could potentially capitilize on a unique comic hero. Brit Reid was way too much of a clown. Nothing even closely emulated real life situations. Kato, with better material could have worked. It (the film) should have been called Kato! What a waste of my time.<br />  Let down again by another "hip" reconstruction of a superhero. Cameron Diaz picking up a paycheck, Seth Rogen being indulged, and blank charactors wanting to make something happen sums it up. If your into The Green Hornet, check out an old Now comic for an interesting take on it. Great audio but so what if I can't connect a film to it.</p></body></html>

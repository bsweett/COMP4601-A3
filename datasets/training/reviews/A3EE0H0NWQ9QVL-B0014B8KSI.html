Thankfully, George Clooney and Steven Soderberg have teamed up again to co-produce a "green" movie with a solid theme. But this time, as I was writing notes for this movie, I noticed that while several characters were being introduced--enough to make my head spin--all my labor was for naught.  For the exposition, although ample, enriched the movie.  The story settles in quickly, and the plot isn't hard to follow.<br /><br />We begin with the titled protagonist (Clooney), known as "The Janitor," a founding member of the law firm Nenner, Bach, and Ledeer.  Despite his prowess, he is the fix-it guy, the one who fixes messes with a cool hand where it's needed most.  It's a thankless job, but he's most suited to do it.  His supervisor, Marty Boch (Sydney Pollack), heaps him with accolades, but not enough cash to keep Michael afloat.  Partly implied are Michael's debts, including from gambling and from a restaurant venture that has folded and is up for auction.<br /><br />Getting a handle on things, Michael is up late at night briefing an important client who had a hit-and-run car accident.  In the midst of this, his late night is protracted by some late night gambling that shows he has the upper hand on his unprofitable addiction.  As he leaves we get the impression someone is following him.  Stopping by the side of a rural road, he comes up to calm some horses until startlingly his parked car explodes.<br /><br />Sporting a thoughtful time frame, the movie backs up four days and shows us some significant developments.  Instead of just being a clever time device, it adds to the suspense of the movie.  It reminded me of a laudable update of something Hitchcock would do.  Backing up we come upon the predictament of Arthur (Tom Wilkinson), a savvy, but unstable lawyer, who is unraveling and leaving Michael almost impotent to remedy his plight.  Off of medication, Arthur is leaving paranoid phone messages and stripping himself naked in public places.  He believes he's had a revelation.  (The contacts he makes with a plaintiff in Wisconsin anchor the movie's plot and poignancy.)  Spending nearly all of his waking hours, he is defending U-North, an agricultural company accused of spreading carcinogenic pesticides by ill plaintiffs.  Tracked by a tough representative, Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) is not impressed by "The Janitor's" alleged mopping skills, and, indeed, there's plenty of evidence in her favor, noting Arthur's AWOL tactics that come back to hit the firm in the face.<br /><br />`Michael Clayton' contains few flaws.  It has perhaps Clooney's best performance since `Syriana' and  Swinton's marvelous rendition of a cool and calculated villain, reminded me of how skillful an actress she truly is.  (Remembering her wonderful, less subtle role as "The White Witch" in `The Chronicles of Narnia,' and having enjoyed her nuanced performance in `Stephanie Daley,' this was another plum performance for her.)  And Wilkinson is thoroughly believable as Arthur.  Without getting too complicated, the details just add more depth to a movie that is captivating and suspenseful from beginning to end.  `Michael Clayton' truly has to be one of the finest films so far this year.</p></body></html>

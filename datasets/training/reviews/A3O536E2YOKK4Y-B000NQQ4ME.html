<meta name="summary" content="Jungle action"></head><body><p>Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" (2006) starts out like a Mayan version of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783241895">Conan the Barbarian</a>" with the raid and destruction of a forest village and then morphs into a horror story as the captives are babarically sacrificed at the Mayan pyramids to appease their gods; the final act turns into a jungle chase reminiscent of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GJUOGC">The Naked Prey</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LVAQDE">Rambo: First Blood</a>". It also has elements of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305609705">Apocalypse Now</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2WP7O">The Last of the Mohicans</a>." With the exception of "The Naked Prey," "Apocalypto" isn't quite as good as any of these films, but it's still a very good jungle adventure.<br /><br />What makes "Apocalypto" a must is the simple fact that there aren't ANY other significant films that depict the Mayan civilization. Just as "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F34HT6">Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan</a>" brought to life the infamous Mongol conqueror and his people, so "Apocalypto" effectively brings to life the Mayans.<br /><br />The spoken language is Mayan with subtitles, but this is mainly a visual experience as there's no elaborate dialogue.<br /><br />There's not much else to say. This is essentially a film about the death throes of a civilization and the dawning of a new era. On a more individualist level, it's about recognizing one's true identity, denying fear and the bold spirit of survival. These themes are conveyed with nigh wall-to-wall jungle action and horror.<br /><br />The film was shot in Mexico and runs 2 hours and 19 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: B+</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Three Boston Men, One Shared Tragedy"></head><body><p>Director Clint Eastwood made the correct decision in Mystic River to closely follow the vision and story portrayed in the best selling novel by local Boston writer Dennis Lehane.  In doing so that meant shooting the film on the mean streets of lower middle class Boston, where the struggles of those depicted contained a ringing relevance.  The script by Brian Helgeland follows Lehane's story closely.<p>The story reveals activities of three Boston men from youth to adulthood at around age 40.  Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins were neighborhood youngsters engaging in the traditional youthful mischief of carving their names in fresh sidewalk cement.  A car stops when they are in the midst of their endeavors.  One of the two men jumps out of the car, falsely identifying himself as a policeman and, after berating them for defacing public property, harshly orders one of them into the car.  The car departs with the two friends watching helplessly.  <p>The years pass and they meet again under anything but auspicious circumstances.  Tim Robbins, the victim of child molestation by the two criminals who abducted him, has trouble adjusting, haunted by the event.  He drinks a lot to still his nerves as well as forget, but instead of forgetting the visions become more vivid,  He talks morbidly about wolves in the woods.  Sean Penn, after a stretch in prison, runs a small market, barely able to make ends meet.  Kevin Bacon is a Boston police detective.<p>When Penn's daughter turns up dead all the old scars from the past are reopened.  Robbins has been involved in a violent incident the same night that Penn's daughter was killed, leading Penn as well as others, including Robbins's wife, Marcia Gay Harden, to suspect him.  When he tells contradictory stories suspicions naturally multiply.  Penn has two local underworld thugs investigate possible Robbins involvement.<p>Kevin Bacon is a man caught in the middle, remembering his old friend Robbins from their respective youths, and his partner Laurence Fishburne is compelled to pressure him to take a long, hard look at Robbins as a suspect.  Eventually Fishburne hauls Robbins in for questioning with tormented Bacon assisting in the process.  <p>The Mystic River holds the key as bodies are dumped there.  These bodies reveal crimes and motivations that will unlock the ultimate mystery of the murder of Penn's daughter.  As Robbins's case is investigated further doubt emerges as to whether he or somebody else killed Penn's daughter.  Secrets from Penn's dark past are also uncovered.  <p>The picture ends in a deliberately ambiguous mode, letting viewers fill in a murky picture emerging from equally murky circumstances.  The ending dovetails with Lehane's hard-hitting novel.  This is Boston in its toughest blue collar mode.</p></body></html>

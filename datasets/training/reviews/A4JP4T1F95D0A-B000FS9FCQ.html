I found it to be a bit long, and I thought it could have been trimmed a tiny bit.  Though I know that Alan Moore fans are already angered by some of the side plots and character trimming that had already occured.  The movie involves a future Britain that has become a Nazi like totalitarian state.  There is no denying the jabs at the current American government.  I am not a big fan of making terrorism a heroic thing, so I wasn't crazy about V blowing up things.  It is an interesting movie and social commentary.  Fine acting, and a fair adaptation.  Worth a watch, but not quite a buy for me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not great, but entertaining enough"></head><body><p>I Am Legend is a classic story of "be careful what you wish for." In the future, a cure for cancer is discovered. Everyone is happy and the creator of the vaccine is hailed as a visionary. Shortly thereafter, it is discovered that the so-called miracle cure actually mutates and causes those who have been vaccinated to turn into rabid, zombie-like creatures who lose their hair, have bloody eyes, and exhibit aggression toward other human beings. When these beings get hungry, they attack human beings until, in the year 2013, there are none left. Or so scientist Robert Neville believes. Alone on the island of Manhattan, but for his dog Sam, Robert attempts to find a cure for the disease and to keep himself from falling victim to the zombies created by the KV vaccine.<br /><br />I Am Legend is startingly like 28 Days Later, and as other reviewers have mentioned, I think that movie did a better job. I did, however, find this movie entertaining, and that's what's important. It's not great. It won't change your life. But it will entertain you, and that's about all I can ask for. If you want a better movie, with a similar theme, try Children on Men with Clive Owen and Julianne Moore. That movie did a much better job of portraying dystopia and the demise of the world.</p></body></html>

This is a good concept completely butchered by a ridiculous script.  I cannot begin to count the number of totally implausible situations that are conjured here.<p>Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) has got to be one of the stupidest characters ever written.  This is supposed to be a bright young lawyer whose ambition has gotten the better of his principles.  Instead he comes across as a hapless loser.<p>When one understands that lawyers can lose their license to practice law for committing felonies even if they don't go to jail, and also knowing that Gavin's entire existence depends on his being a lawyer, almost everything he does is utterly illogical.  He leaves the scene of the accident with Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson) when he could easily have called the court to advise them that he had been in a wreck.  Contrary to how it was portrayed, that hearing could have been rescheduled.  The judge probably would have required some proof of the accident, but that's about it.  Yet he drives off knowing he could go to jail and lose his law license for this.  Nonsense.<p>It gets worse.  He decides to alter financial records, (a felony), so he can blackmail Gipson (a felony) and he LEAVES HIS NAME ON GIPSON'S VOICEMAIL TO TELL HIM THIS?!  As if Gipson would tell no-one and the FBI wouldn't be at his office in 15 minutes to lock him up.<p>That's just the warm-up.  In the course of the next hour, the two of them commit about a dozen felonies between them, and then inexplicably do a 180 degree turn and become the Justice League of America.  I guess this is supposed to erase all the mayhem they caused during the first 90 minutes of the film and make us feel like they are great guys for realizing the errors of their ways.  <p>Samuel Jackson gives another excellent performance rendering the only character that is remotely believable other than Sydney Pollack who is credible as the crooked law partner pulling all the strings.<p>Ben Affleck is awful, but to be fair his character is so moronic that it would be hard for anyone to play this part and not look foolish.  Affleck's biggest mistake was agreeing to take this part in the first place.  Toni Collette and Amanda Peet both come across as gutless whiners.<p>This film is an insult to the audiences' intelligence, not to mention to lawyers in general.  This is not to say that there aren't crooked lawyers, but they are lawyers for heaven's sake; they know the law.  When they break it, they usually do it deviously, not like common street thugs.<p>Other than Jackson's performance, there is not much to recommend this film.  I rated it a 3/10.  Don't waste your time.</p></body></html>

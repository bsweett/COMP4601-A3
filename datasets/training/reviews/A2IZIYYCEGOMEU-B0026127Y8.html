What I liked best was that the fight scenes were coolly efficient, and much more believable than the acrobatic hyperbole in most action films of late- although I am a bit tired of seeing firefights in which the only person capable of shooting straight is the hero. This was a nice, taut, vengence-driven, violence-filled pic that was definitely bumped up a few notches by the effortless believability of its star. TAKEN is a perfect popcorn pic for guys.</p></body></html>

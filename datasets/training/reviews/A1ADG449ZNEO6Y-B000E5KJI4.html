<meta name="summary" content="The Battle of Troy"></head><body><p>Most likely the largest ammount of soliders in a war I ever seen in a movie.It wasn't to bloody but a nice clean movie.Yes they show blood and spears through heads and whatever not , but I woyuldn't own it just for the simple fact it's 162 minutes long and I won't ever watch it again.Brad Pitt played his part very well as the best warrior of the world.He was badd-azz.Rent this movie only.</p></body></html>

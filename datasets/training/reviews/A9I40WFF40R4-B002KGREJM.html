He becomes the cruel dictator for every moment he is on the screen in this two-hour film and plays Amin as an extremely complex man who has had an interesting experience in the British military, loves all things Scottish and is willing to put his complete trust in a young white physician Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) who goes to Uganda in the early 1970's to begin his practice of medicine. Young and full of optimism, he goes to Uganda to "make a difference," becomes Amin's personal physician quite by accident on his part and gradually becomes sucked into the maelstrom of the dictator's evil machinations.<br /><br />The music is beautiful--  for example, a native singer performs a soulful rendition of Kris Kristofferson's plaintive "Me and Bobby McGhee"-- and the filming comes off as completely authentic. My only concern with this must-see movie is that McAvoy looks too young to be a physician. Surely he would have had to have been approaching thirty to have just finished medical school, but he looks much younger. I heard an African American professor giving a civil rights speech shortly after Whitaker won his awards who in passing criticized this film because Amin is "saved and protected" by a white man, the physician. (Garrigan is a fictionalized character from the novel by Giles Foden.) I would argue just the opposite since Garrigan's life is saved by an African physican who loses his own for saving Garrigan's.<br /><br /> The DVD version has documentary footage from Amin's life that is certainly worth seeing along with this highly suspenseful movie that is not to be missed.</p></body></html>

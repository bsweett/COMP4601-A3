<meta name="summary" content="Clooney's the best"></head><body><p>One of Clooney's very best, "Michael Clayton" will have you glued in your seat from start to finish. Michael is a regular guy from a typical Irish working class background that New Yorkers will immediately recognize. He's supposedly made good at a big time law firm, with his crisply tailored suits and firm Mercedes, but in reality he's a bag man, a janitor, the guy who cleans up the personal messes of the firm's big clients. It's hard not to like George Clooney, but he does a great job making Clayton unsympathetic--he's a distant, divorced father, a mostly absent son, an unsympathetic brother, a failed bar owner and an unsuccessful high-stakes card player. He's a worn-out 45 who isn't going anywhere and doesn't know why. When one of the firm's high profile litigation partners goes into melt down, Clayton of course is called in to clean up the train wreck. Clooney is so good that we don't know even at the very end what he'll do with what he finds. This is definitely an adult movie--no sex, a bit of bad language, little violence--but the subject matter would bore anyone not in their 20's at least. But for those of us past (maybe quite a bit past) that age, this film is a winner.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An inferior "reimagining" of a sci-fi classic"></head><body><p>XXXXX<br /><br />This sci-fi movie is a "reimagining" or a loose remake of the original classic 1951 film of the same name.  There are two extras with this movie, the most interesting and unexpected one being the original black and white classic on a second disc.<br /><br />For those that don't know, this movie (and the original) are about a space alien (and his robot) who comes to Earth with an important message.<br /><br />In this movie, the alien Klatuu (Keanu Reeves) is aided mainly by astrobiologist Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) and her stepson (Jaden Smith) with some help from genius Professor Barnhardt (John Cleese).<br /><br />This movie has a promising beginning but then settles into a story that alternates between Klatuu & Benson and the army trying to secure Klatuu's robot (eventually named GORT by humans).  This movie is full of respectable references to the original movie.<br /><br />We don't really learn about why Klatuu has come to Earth until about an hour into the movie.  This movie tries to evoke action in the last thirty minutes but by that time it's difficult to save it.<br /><br />This movie is heavy on special effects but is without a coherent story at its base.  In other words, I had a difficult time following this movie.  This movie takes it plot so seriously that the plot stands still with it.<br /><br />I had no problem with Reeves and Connelly in their roles.  My problem came with having John Cleese (of Monty Python fame) playing genius Professor Barnhardt.  I'm afraid he just doesn't look like a genius.  (Compare him with Sam Jaffe who played the professor in the original.)  And the little boy played by Jaden Smith was just annoying.  (Compare him with Billy Gray who played the little boy in the original.)<br /><br />By the way, why and how does the Earth stand still in this movie?  This is the movie's last scene.  I have subsequently read a summary of this movie and now know why the Earth stood still but the reason is not apparent when watching the movie.<br /><br />The background musical score in this movie was not all that impressive.  (Compare it with the eerie space-like score of the original.)<br /><br />I'm not going to review the original movie here.  You're going to have to see for yourself why it is "one of the classics of the sci-fi genre."  The original is easily a 5-star movie.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (released in 2009) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  As well, the DVD of the original movie has been cleaned up.  It probably has better picture and sound quality than when it was first released!!  Be sure to listen for the following famous robot command in the original movie:<br /><br />"Gort, Klatuu barada nikto"<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie is a disappointing reimagining of a sci-fi classic.<br /><br />** 1/2<br /><br />(2008/1951;  1 hr, 45 min/1 hr, 30 min;  wide screen/full screen; 28 scenes/24 scenes;  color/black and white; 2 discs)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></body></html>

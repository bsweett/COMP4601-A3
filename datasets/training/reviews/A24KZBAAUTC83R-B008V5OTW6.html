<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg's MUNICH takes you back..."></head><body><p>I remember this timeline faintly as a wee lad. So for that reason, along with the fact that most of Steven Spielberg's films are good, I decided to see this film.<br /><br />Other than SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, one of my all-time favorite war films, MUNICH didn't seem like the typical Spielberg film. No WAR OF THE WORLDS nor dinos here. But an assembly of assassins that one won't soon forget. Set in the early 70's, MUNICH takes one back to when terrorists first started making their appearance on American TV's.<br /><br />Highly political, with intrigues and mysteries of various dark organizations, MUNICH takes you through a labyrinth of dark corridors throughout Europe and stains each one with blood.<br /><br />With a rich ensemble cast, MUNICH is tightly well written, although some may be somewhat lost in the various long histories of the several peoples involved. But the main character, the leader of the assassins, played by The HULK's and TROY's Eric Bana, does a great acting performance here.<br /><br />There is a lot going on in this film. Lots of action and intrigue. But most of all, it makes one look at the heart, perhaps the very root of the problems at several warring factions. If you have nearly 3 hours to kill, then this film is for you.<br /><br />It is an important film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jack the Ripper leaves some loose threads"></head><body><p>There are more books about Jack The Ripper in print today than of all the US presidents combined.  No really.  What is it about this story that draws us in?  Evil?  Mystery?  The seemy side of life?  Conspiracy theories?  Maybe.  So many things seem so clear now, while so many things will never be solved today.<br /><br />This movie was just ok, I share no illusions about it being otherwise.  What I would recommend you do is watch the special features with the Jack The Ripper documentary first, then the movie.  The story is rather choppy and tends to bore, plus the people the actors portray are softened up quite a bit to the point where you might actually like them when in real life they probably were not so likable.<br /><br />In the roughneck White Cross district in London during the Victorian age, a few prostitutes are murdered.  Nothing to bat an eye at, as most women involved in prosititution will most likely be the victims of violent crime at some point.  What is odd, as the theories would later project, that all of these women in this particular neighborhood knew each other.  They knew each other fairly well, two were even roommates at one point or another, and they all operated out of the same stretch of street when they picked up their johns.  The theory is that they were being targeted, if you believe the most popular of popular theories, as they were being silenced.  These women were blackmailing the royal family as they were witness to the marriage of one of Queen Victoria's sons to a common woman (formerly of their profession), in a Catholic ceremony, and birth of a potential threat to the royal liniage.<br /><br />The movie, curiously enough, skirts around the fact that all the women, both of the prostitute circle and the mother of baby Alice (the child in question), did not know that the wealthy man she was being kept by was a prince.  They were portrayed moreso as victims, there was never a hint that they were attempting to gain from this knowledge.  The last of the prostitutes in real life was the one most brutally murdered, but in the movie goes off to care for baby Alice in a secluded location far away.  Alice lived a long life and died in the 1950s.  But no one ever seemed to indicated if she was privy to this information or if she lived her life blissfully unaware.  There were too many things they turned into Disney aspects and too many things they left unresolved.</p></body></html>

Another fine directing job by Clint Eastwood and executively produced by Stephen Spielberg... these guys do not make junk (lol).  I gave "Hereafter" 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have appreciated a bit more weight to the film, but overall it was well acted, interesting and beautifully done.  A gentle view of what might be.<br /><br />4.5 stars!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great sci-fi comedy thriller, nice blu-ray transfer"></head><body><p>I've always thought this was one of the most visually impressive sci-fi flicks, and the blu-ray is quite impressive. Not a perfect transfer but a very good one; clearly the greedy studios are always holding something back in every new technological jump, be it vhs, dvd, or blu-ray, so that the fans will always have to buy something new.<br /><br />To whit: zero extras on this disc! There were plenty in previous editions, so where'd they go? Bogus.<br /><br />But it is a truly classic flick, and Besson's made none better since. Willis is about as good as he gets, which is pretty good. Always entertaining (but never truly masterful), he's perfect for this role. Oldman is top dog in this flick, for my money, and he's hilarious. But it's the director who really shines.<br /><br />Besson never misses his mark here, and throws in many nods to other genre masterpieces, especially Blade Runner and Star Wars; he obviously learned his lessons from these and many more. The plot moves swiftly throughout, and the film never lags. It's lushly shot, with many delicious compositions making the most of the stellar set design. Fifth Element works on most every level, from its far-fetched but self-effacing script to the performances to the non-stop hyper-colorful eye candy on parade throughout. My only qualm is Chris Tucker's increasingly annoying turn. He's clearly meant to camp it up, but after a while his screaming grates like a baby on a flight to New Zealand. Other than that, this movie is pure pleasure every time I see it.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I'd say hold off on buying this blu-ray until the studio shelves its pathetic greed and includes the extras they included on earlier editions. A movie of this quality deserves only the best treatment, not typical studio weasel greed.</p></body></html>

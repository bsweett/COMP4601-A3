<meta name="summary" content="Lots of fun"></head><body><p>This was a hell of a fun film.I was initially expecting something much worse,but was pleasently surprised.There were great stunts&action from begining to end,and "The Rock"  has pretty much found his nich in Hollywood as the next action hero.Seems as though Shwartzenager has passed the torch in favor of pollitics,and you get to see that more or less in the begining.The Rock also has a good comedic side to him,and it adds to the enjoyment of this film.Alot of fun gets poked at him,and he plays off it very well.The fight scenes were pretty exciting,he even gets the S&^#!?#^* slapped out of him by a 5ft tall 115lb guy....it was quite good.Christopher Walken is always a joy to see,even if he has small parts.He has a certin charisma about him,and he can just do "the greedy bad guy" without even trying.All in all...it's a blast,and you'll be thinking by the end of the film.Option A,B....but what about option C?</p></body></html>

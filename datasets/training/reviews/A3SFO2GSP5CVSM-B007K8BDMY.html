The documentary Grizzly Man does not attempt to answer this query, yet it does its best to bring this tendency to its odd apogee, and is literally unlike any other documentary film I've ever seen. Coming off his participation in the great mockumentary Incident At Loch Ness, it should not come as a surprise that German filmmaker par excellence, Werner Herzog, would stick with the documentary format in this, his latest film. No, it is not a nature documentary, as most film critics, including Roger Ebert, have written, simply because it follows a man who spent thirteen consecutive summers filming grizzlies on an Alaskan wildlife refuge, Katmai National Park, on Kodiak Island, but a documentary whose subject matter is a man's flaming insanity, as it charts the life and death of a fey, severely mentally ill blond man with a Prince Valiant haircut, originally from Long Island, New York, named Timothy Treadwell, who spent summers filming bears, and the rest of the year going to schools, showing his films freely.<br />  I get tired of books and films devoted to the worst in society- the insane, criminal, selfish, greedy, shallow, etc. While watching the tale of this supposedly reformed drug addicted alcoholic-cum-New Age weirdo, I could not help but compare his life and death to that of another deluded narcissist who perished over a decade earlier than Treadwell, also in the wilds of a Alaska- Chris McCandless, whose delusions of being one with nature led to his death in 1992, chronicled in adventure writer Jon Krakauer's bestselling book Into The Wild. McCandless was another bored, spoiled, upper middle class white boy whose easy life was seen as something `terrible' to deal with. So, he bummed around the country, using many aliases- including Alexander Supertramp, until he decided he would go and rough it in the Alaskan wilds, alone and ill-prepared. That he ended up starving to death in an abandoned bus made him a hero to addle-minded nature buffs, and a target of scorn to Alaska natives who respect nature, and resent twits like McCandless being seen as anything other than the fools they were. Yet, Treadwell was worse, and his end even more ignominious, because not only did he get himself killed and eaten by a bear, but also his 37 year old blond girlfriend- Amy Huguenard. And, when he died in 2003, Treadwell was 46 years old, while McCandless was only half that age upon his death in 1992.<br />  Yet, there is no denying Treadwell, was mentally unhinged, even as Herzog rapturously declaims his filmic abilities with a camera, and imbues the most banal shots with an intent and skill that just is not there onscreen, lacking any real style. Herzog must have had to tell himself this to justify his fascination with Treadwell's bizarre antics.... I would have cut the film thirty to forty of its one hour forty-five minute running time, because much gets repetitive. This is a film worth seeing, but only if you bear in mind the wisdom of one of the helicopter pilots who flew home the duo's remains. He calls Treadwell a retard, then states, `He was treating them like people in bear costumes. He got what he deserved,' a statement echoed by a Native American Kodiak Island museum director, who says, `My people have been living nicely with bears for thousands of years and we know enough to stay out of each other's way.'<br />  That Treadwell did not only begs the question I opened this review with- why does Herzog feel this man's stupidity and idiocy are worth glorifying in film? Especially when he clearly believes Treadwell's philosophy is wrong. Where Treadwell sees cuddly things he'd die for, cooing he loves them, even as he actually taunts the bears, as if they were stuffed animals, like the teddy bear he sleeps with in his tent, Herzog sees indifferent creatures who could make a meal out of you at any time, and we see a well meaning idiot, the New Age nuts that revere him, and a film that is perversely fascinating. Ah, the answer!</p></body></html>

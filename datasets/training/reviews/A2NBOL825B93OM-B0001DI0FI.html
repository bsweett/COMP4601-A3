<meta name="summary" content="On deck"></head><body><p>I've never read a book by Patrick O'Brien featuring captain Lucky Jack Aubrey, so everything on "Master and Commander" was new to me. First of all, Peter Weir proved to be a very intelligent director, making the viewers totally at ease and making me feel I was part of Aubrey's crew. Sometimes it seemed I was on the deck of HMS Surprise. <p>Second, though the story is not original and really showed no surprises (no pun intended), the screenplay is very good. At first sight, a 130-minute movie that goes on pratically only aboard a ship seems dull and boring. But the scenes are always significant to the context of the film, and the screenplay provides interesting insights on the characters' personalities, not only the two main characters (Jack Aubrey and the Doctor Maturin) but minor ones as well. I think the children's and teenagers' acting was great. The battle scenes are impressive, and the quiet and sometimes funny scenes on Galapagos Islands proved to be a nice interlude. <p>Surprisingly, Russel Crowe is not in his acclaimed usual macho-style as in "Gladatior" and "Proof of life". He plays Jack Aubrey as a commanding but sensitive man (his musical scenes with the doctor are great - in fact the music in the movie is very good and appropriate). But the one who steals every scene he's in is the real-life Lucky (his wife is Jennifer Connelly) Paul Bettany as Dr. Stephen Maturin. <p>"Master and commander" is not only a nicely-executed film, but also great entertainment as well.<p>Grade 9.0/10</p></body></html>

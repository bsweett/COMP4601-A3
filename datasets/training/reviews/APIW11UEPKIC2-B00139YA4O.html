<meta name="summary" content="This brings TV shows to a whole new level"></head><body><p>I don't watch many TV shows, but every once in a while I like to wathc the first episode or 2 of a new show.  This has to be one of the best shows ever.  I have not been this deep in a show since OZ.  The character development of every character is explored to unravel things that happened in their life to show why it contributed to them being on the island.  The monster is pretty intriguing and the storylines get better with each episode.  My favorite character is Lock.  His life has been branched out to hit on everything possible that could have happened to him.  I am still trying to figure out how he regained life to his legs, lost them, then regained full strength again.<br /><br />Season 2 is not near as good as this, but if you wanna watch season 3 later on and wanna get what's going on this season, season 1 is a must see.  This ranks right up there with all my favortie shaows over like Oz, Newsradio, Taxi, and Batman the Animated series, so if you found any of those entertaining you will like this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE DEAD RISE ONCE AGAIN"></head><body><p>So many people decried the makers of this film when they learned that the classic of all modern day zombie films was going to be remade. Rather than wait and see what the final product was, they chose the low road of attacking it based on their cherished memories of the past, the midnight showings where a world was exposed to the inner workings of creator George Romero's zombie nightmare. They should have waited and judged the final product instead. Not to mention the fact that in allowing his name to be used, Romero is now going to see some financial gain. Buy a ticket and send him some money.<br /><br />The plot is simple and follows that established in 1968 in the original. For some unknown reason, the dead are coming back to life with one thing on their mind, eating the living. There you have it in a nutshell. Now, let's take that story and add in the human elements and you have a tale.<br /><br />This time around the story begins with Ana (Sarah Polley), a young nurse who wakes to find her world turned upside down. An attack by the little girl next door leads to her husband's death and subsequent attack. Ana escapes into a world she doesn't recognize where neighbors attack one another and no help is in sight. After wrecking her car, she meets with a policeman named Kenneth (Ving Rhames) and they head out, coming into contact with three other survivors. Together, this rag tag group heads for the mall in the hopes of finding other survivors there as well.<br /><br />Instead, they are attacked by another zombie. Looking for high ground, they head to the elevators only to be greeted by the mall's security guards who ask them to leave. Convincing them to allow them to stay for a while, the group eventually comes to realize that they have a better chance if they work together, even if it takes force for the Ana's group to convince the guards.<br /><br />Going to the roof to search for help, the assembly discovers that none is in sight. Instead, the mall is surrounded by zombies all eager to kill and feed. When a helicopter flies overhead and continues on, they know that they are on their own.<br /><br />The movie offers us a glimpse at how each of the survivors deals with their situation, including another group that drives in and is offered shelter. By this time they have come to realize that a bite from one of the dead results in a quick death and subsequent rise to feast on flesh. One of these later survivors has been bitten and is already showing signs. His daughter is distraught over the possibility of losing her father, but the inevitable happens.<br /><br />Looking for solutions, the possibility of leaving the mall and heading out to the marina where they will take a boat to one of the neighboring islands is discussed. With the chance that the island won't have near as many zombies on it as the mainland, they set out to do just that. Creating a pair of battlewagons from the store's shuttle buses, they head out into a sea of zombies with hunger in mind.<br /><br />Many people who view this will indeed make comparisons between it and the original film. The makers of this one have stated that they are not remaking the film, only offering their version of how it could have played out.<br /><br />One review I read found two major faults this time around. The first was that the movie changed the zombie mythos created years ago where zombies were moving slowly, unable to more fast due to rigor setting in. The other was that there were no personalized zombies as in the first, such as the nurse zombie, the cheerleader zombie, etc. Both criticisms were lost to me as I was engulfed in the story more than the zombies. And the fact that these zombies, as in 29 DAYS LATER, moved with speed and quickness, made the movie more terrifying. As with the old mummy movies, I often wondered why people couldn't avoid a creature that moved with a handicapped gait. The fact that they could move in this movie made them more horrific.<br /><br />This time around, the zombies seem scarier than ever before. The action is plentiful and makes the pacing of the movie revolve around not just the question of how survivors react, but how they will compete when facing off of these hungry creations that live only to eat.<br /><br />The movie is scary, thought provoking and kept me glued to the seat waiting to see what would happen next. While Romero's earlier work was a fantastic film, this one ranks up there as well, offering that second take that the film makers said they wanted to provide. My only gripe? The ending. And no matter how much it disappointed me, I would never reveal it. Go and sit it that darkened theater, alone with a multitude of strangers, and find out for yourself. And wonder all along if any of them might be eyeing you as their next meal ticket.</p></body></html>

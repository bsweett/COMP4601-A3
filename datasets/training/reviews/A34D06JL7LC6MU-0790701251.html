<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's Vietnam"></head><body><p>Full Metal Jacket is a unique entry in the Stanley Kubrick canon, as it's not quite a masterpiece but is as iconic and frequently discussed as his other films. Released in 1987, seven years after his previous film The Shining, Kubrick tackles the then-popular subject of the Vietnam War but puts his own Kubrickian spin on it. At 117 minutes, Full Metal Jacket was the shortest film Kubrick had made since 1964 despite a first and second half that seem like two different films.<br /><br />As if any introduction is necessary, the film opens with Marine Corps recruits entering training at Parris Island and meeting Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), who intends to turn the recruits into hardened marines during their stay. Even those who haven't seen the film know about the opening scene, featuring Gunnery Sergeant Hartman meeting the recruits and spouting some oft-quoted dialogue that has become a part of the cultural vernacular. The first seven minutes is arguably one of the greatest opening scenes in film history. It's certainly one of the most iconic. Out of all the recruits, the film centers attention on Private Joker (Matthew Modine) and Private Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'onofio), a simple, overweight recruit who incurs Hartman's wrath and is nicknamed "Gomer Pyle." As Hartman begins putting the recruits through their training, he endlessly harasses the simple-minded Private Pyle, eventually pairing him up with Joker in the hopes that it will improve Pyle's skill. These scenes at Parris Island feature some of the most hilarious, depressing, and fascinating stuff that Kubrick ever shot and it's all over after a mere 45 minutes.<br /><br />I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the first 45 minutes of Full Metal Jacket is an undisputed masterpiece. After the Parris Island scenes, it essentially becomes a different film with the locale switching abruptly from South Carolina to Vietnam circa January of 1968. Here, Joker is a journalist accompanied by Private First Class Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), a combat photographer. With the beginning of the Tet Offensive, Joker and Rafterman are sent to cover the enemy attacks in South Vietnam. Here, Joker is reunited with Cowboy (Arliss Howard), one of the recruits at Parris Island, now a Sergeant and second-in-command of the Lusthog Squad. We're introduced to several members of the Lusthog Squad, most memorably Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin) a machine gunner, who's given some of the most interesting dialogue about the war effort.  The two halves of Full Metal Jacket are so disassociated from each other it's hard to believe, at times, they're from the same film. The second half is strong, very strong in fact, and effectively entertaining; but it fails to live up to the momentum of the first half and is simply not as memorable as what came before it. Even so, the climactic standoff with the sniper is one of the strongest scenes in the entire film.<br /><br />England was used as a substitute for Vietnam and is beautiful at times, while at others Kubrick's Vietnam more closely resembles a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Even with the onslaught of Vietnam-related films that had been coming out of Hollywood and picking up accolades for the several years leading up to this film's release, not a single frame of this film seems overly familiar. Kubrick's composition of the most minor, seemingly insignificant shot was and remains awe-inspiring. Kubrick's Vietnam film may not be the best Vietnam film, but it certainly has some of the most memorable imagery. Oddly enough, there is something lacking from this film in regards to Kubrick's style. Perhaps it's the lack of classical music that characterizes so many of Kubrick's films and really lend to the atmosphere and style, but Full Metal Jacket, as a whole, lacks the distinct Kubrickian atmosphere that can be spotted in all of his output from 1968 on even by the most untrained eye. There are the unbroken, static shots that seem so still even when there's movement as well as the dead-stare of characters descending into madness that give him away, but there's a tone that's noticeably missing from this film.<br /><br />Based on the novel The Short-Timers by Gustav Hasford, who co-wrote the script with Kubrick and Michael Herr, the film is not overtly political and lacks a defined pro or anti stance on war, but that doesn't make it a straight-forward war film either. With Joker sporting the iconic words "Born to Kill" on his helmet, while wearing a peace sign on his flak jacket and discussing the duality of man ("the Jungian thing") with his Major, there's enough of the high-minded here to give a Kubrick disciple plenty to analyze. However, it's no wonder that out of Kubrick's other efforts Full Metal Jacket has arguably been most embraced by the average moviegoer and teenager.<br /><br />Full Metal Jacket features some stunning and unforgettable performances, particularly R. Lee Ermey (credited without the "R.") and D'onofio. There is absolutely nothing I can say about Ermey's brilliant performance that hasn't already been said and D'onofrio too has received his share of acclaim for his sympathetic, tragic performance. There's plenty of great acting across the board here, but the acting is less consistent than one would expect from a Kubrick film (him being such a perfectionist). There are very minor, almost unnoticeable moments where an actor will briefly appear, unconvincingly deliver his dialogue, and disappear. There is nothing glaringly bad, but there are a few moments where the actors just don't seem up to snuff.<br /><br />This is overall a lesser film for Stanley Kubrick, the only one of his films released between 1969 and 1999 that isn't a masterpiece. With that in mind, this shows what a phenomenal filmmaker Kubrick was as most directors would hope that one of their lesser films was of this quality. It's not that Full Metal Jacket isn't a masterpiece in comparison to his other films, it's just lacking in certain areas that keep it from being a masterpiece itself. There's a lack of cohesion between the two parts of the film; they exist so far apart from each other that it almost feels like a great film was cut short and a good film, with some great scenes, was edited onto it. It's a near-masterpiece and an undeniable cultural landmark, a film that will stand the test of time among Kubrick's other work. The biggest problem with Full Metal Jacket is that is has scenes many will remember forever and others they'll quickly forget.<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></body></html>

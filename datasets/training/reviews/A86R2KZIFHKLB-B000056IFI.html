This is the Terminator that starts it all, totally evil and destructive robots. No more warm and fuzzy robots, Robbie, Gort, Robot, and Tobor, this one wants to kill you, and will never stop, not ever. This movie begins the stories of Sarah Conner, Kyle Reese, John Conner (not yet born), and a particularly nasty Terminator. A low budget flick turned super hit. More than excellent movie</p></body></html>

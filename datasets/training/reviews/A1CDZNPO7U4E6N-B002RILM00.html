<meta name="summary" content="Nick, my boy..stick to ACTION movies!"></head><body><p>What the hell? Is all I could say at the end of this movie. What the hell? As in, what the hell was Nick Cage thinking when he read this script and decided this film was a good project. Come on, is he really that hard up for work that he's only taking what he can get now. I think he seriously needs to find his agent and fire him immediately. This movie was so far below Nick Cage's talent and acting ability it's laughable. Frankly, Nick needs to stick to the action/drama genre because movies this bad can really murder a career. I really hate to do this for anybody who hasn't seen this movie yet, but at what point were the viewers actually suppose to be surprised that the sacrifice turns out to be him in the end. Whether you've seen the old one or not, I can't imagine anybody not seeing that part coming a mile away. Quit frankly, this movie is awful, and this is time out of my life I won't get back. Please, take this review as a warning, and spare yourself an evening of torment and boredom like I wish someone had spared me. If you are in a video store, remember this review and place it back on a the shelf. If someone wants to let you borrow it, respectfully turn it down, and get something else as fast as you can. I wish someone had warned me that watching this movie would've made me so frustrated that I would sacrifice myself to be delivered from the pain and suffering I felt while watching this, or even worse I'd rather eat a bowl of crushed glass and down it with a glass of alcohol rather than watch this movie a 2nd time. I'm sorry, I guess that was an exaggeration. This movie is just enough to stretch anyone's patience level.</p></body></html>

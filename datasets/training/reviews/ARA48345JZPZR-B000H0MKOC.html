<meta name="summary" content="I'm THAT guy on Crack!"></head><body><p>The old saying is that satire is what closes on Saturday night, but I hope "Thank You For Smoking" belies the rule because we need all the wry and sardonic laughter we can get in these days of being squeezed by the religious Right on one hand and the politically correct Left on the other.<br /><br />Absolutely politically incorrect is Aaron Eckhart's fast-talking, unabashed, unrepentant Big Tobacco spokesman in this very funny film about lobbying, spin, and turning a few conventions on their head.  Eckhart's great charm and enthusiasm invigorates a story that may not be plot-heavy but is laced with wry observance and sharp asides, one-liners and telling character details.<br /><br />Fast and light on its feet, the film benefits by a first rate cast turning in nicely nuanced turns, and congratulations to Jason Reitman and his backers for keeping the film true to its vision and not allowing it to go soft and mushy or copping-out in any sense all the way to its conclusion.<br /><br />Amazingly, every once and awhile one of these films comes along that gets made the way it should, and is allowed to remain intact and un-Hollywoodized or otherwise reduced to mass comfortability.  This is one of those, and while it wears its cynicism lightly, it doesn't miss jabbing at the pomposity and hypocrisy found in Washington DC, Hollywood, the Media and the culture in general.  There are a lot of other targets out there that could use similar treatment.  Let's hope.</p></body></html>

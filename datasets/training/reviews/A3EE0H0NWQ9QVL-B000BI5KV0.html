<meta name="summary" content="The Penguin Channel"></head><body><p>If this movie were made in the seventies, it would be called "Everything You Wanted to Know About Penguins, but Didn't Think to Ask," and it wouldn't match the splendor of "March of the Penguins".  What makes this movie transcend the usual nature movies like the old Disney features, "Vanishing Prairie," et. al, is that it is exquisitely filmed, smoothly narrated (by Morgan Freeman) and fascinatingly focused.  (The life cycle of Antarctic penguins is documented for one year, so it flows like a story.)  The whole experience is vivid and engaging.  The viewer is invited intimately into the penguin community, while the visual grandeur is garnished by beautiful music that matches the mood of every scene.  The information is really fresh, for who hasn't known, or at least assumed to know, a great deal about penguins?  "March of the Penguins," takes new and old territory and packages it in a way that is surprisingly well done.</p></body></html>

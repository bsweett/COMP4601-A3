The only problem was the entire story wasn't interesting enough to care about, so after 50% of the film went by, I really lost interest.  I also didn't care for the slow motion effects showing people dying and blood squirting from their bodies.  The V character was decent, but he can't save an average film.  Some of the special effects were good (such as that exploding clock) but that's about the only thing worth noting I found about the film.</p></body></html>

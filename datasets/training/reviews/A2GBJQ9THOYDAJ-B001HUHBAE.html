I remember the Zodiac killings when they were happening, and the fact that no one was ever caught, and the sense of frustration comes through in every frame. The extremely complex chain of events, stretching over a period of twenty years, is very smoothly handled. In fact, the editing -- which is crucial in a story like this -- is nearly perfect. The story comes mostly from the book by Robert Graysmith (nicely played here as an obsessed nerd by Jake Gyllenhaal). Mark Ruffalo plays the lead cop on the case, whose career is shaken in the process, and Robert Downey, Jr., plays Paul Avery, the San Francisco Chronicle crime reporter whom the case helps turn into an alcoholic. The story pulls the viewer in, winding you up in its web of facts and interpretations and hesitancies. The sloppiness of nearly all the cops is startling, as is the cavalier treatment of evidence by the journalists involved; I suspect people today, used to CSI on TV and to the widespread forensic use of DNA, would react quite differently. An excellent film.</p></body></html>

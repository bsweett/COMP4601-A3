<meta name="summary" content="Not as bad as awful as the critics claim, but could have been much beter"></head><body><p>I never did understand how Oliver Stone came to direct <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UPGQIU">Alexander, Revisited</a>. Somebody like David McLean (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016K40KY">Lawrence of Arabia</a>) or Ridley Scott (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ZYBY">Gladiator</a>) seems more appropriate. Stone's vision of Alexander is an attempt at epic, but never quite reaches the grandeur of these other films.<br /><br />First of all, the casting seems all wrong. The Hollywood cast isn't really a great fit for an epic film like [ASIN:B000UPGQIU Alexander]]. Colin Farrell (Alexander) is decent, but not great. At times, he cuts a less than commanding presence. Angelina Jolie overplayed her part as Alexander's mother Olympias. She comes across as psychotic (especially with the fake accent) rather than powerful. Anthony Hopkins' narration becomes intrusive and ruins the drama of parts of the film, rather than enhance it. Some of the best epic films, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016K40KY">Lawrence of Arabia</a>) or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ZYBY">Gladiator</a> relied upon relative unknowns (Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe, respectively), allowing the audience to accept them in the role of historical giants. Farrell and Jolie are too recognizable and don't fill the part.<br /><br />Historically, the movie seems to buy into the whole mythology surrounding Alexander as a generous victor and advocate of liberty. The film starts with a historical inaccuracy -  the notion that Darius' army at Issus had hundreds of thousands of men (in fact, the Persian army was probably around the same size as Alexander's). Also, in the movie Alexander's father is portrayed as a drunken fool, but in real life he was quite a king himself who probably would have conquered the Persian empire in his own right. For a good biography of Alexander that dispels some of the myths, check out Peter Green's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520071662">Alexander of Macedon 356-323 B.C.: A Historical Biography</a>. But in a lot of other respects, the film is somewhat accurate and many of the anecdotes (such as Alexander's taming his horse as a child). In short, the plot sticks fairly close to a realistic, if glorified, interpretation of Alexander's life.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if you're interested in Alexander the Great or movies about the ancient world more generally,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UPGQIU">Alexander, Revisited</a> - the expanded version of the film - isn't quite as bad as most critics allege. The revised version has more footage and is definitely an improvement over the theatrical version. But <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UPGQIU">Alexander, Revisited</a> probably isn't one you'll watch over many times.</p></body></html>

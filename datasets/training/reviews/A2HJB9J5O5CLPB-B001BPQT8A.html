<meta name="summary" content="90's Detectives"></head><body><p>Each decade has a seminal detective yarn.  In the 30's and 40's wisecracking, cynical gumshoes roamed the city.  Bogart played those cunning detectives, always in control.  In the 70's and 80's Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry tired of government bureaucracy and asked criminals if they felt lucky today before he took care of business.  And he was in control. In the Clinton 90's the maniac murderers are in control.  Morgan Freeman is reluctant to barge into the killer's apartment because he doesn't have a warrant.  Brad Pitt barges in with Dirty Harry force, but by the end of the movie he has been coerced by the murderer's cunning.  It wasn't Clinton's fault he lost control in the Oval office, and it's not Brad's fault he loses it either.  Bogart and Eastwood control the crime scene and avert mayhem by killing or capturing the bad guys.  Germany and Japan had to get a belly full of lead.  I guess those pesky terrorists have us by the b###s now.</p></body></html>

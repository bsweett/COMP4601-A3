<meta name="summary" content="Highly Entertaining!!"></head><body><p>The director took a little bit of Pulp Fiction and combined it with some of the gore of Kill Bill to come up with this highly entertaining film.  It is like a dark comic book come to life, shot in black in white, with color only used when the director was emphasizing something.<br /><br />The main actors Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, and Bruce Willis are all excellent in different ways.  All three are protectors of the women and act as dark knights to save them.  Additionally, Josh Harnett seems to be floating about as someone who murders troubled women.<br /><br />The special effects are wild, the violance graphic and the women are very hot!  Don't look for realism in this film because you won't find it.  It is more like a dark fantasy where guys can get shot a hundred times, get hit by cars, jump off buildings and keep coming.  Highly Entertaining and well worth watching on DVD because you can rewind things that you couldn't believe that you saw!</p></body></html>

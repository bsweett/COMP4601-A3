<meta name="summary" content="A gorgeous film!"></head><body><p>I have been lucky enough to encounter great films that I probably wouldn't have watched had it not been for Netflix.  I watched and fell in love with The Prestige and was curious about a movie that was being compared to it called The Illusionist.  Curious, I gave it a whirl.  First thing I have to say is that the stories of The Illusionist and The Prestige are nothing alike.  Content-wise, they have similar themes and setting (late Victorian, early Edwardian) and then there is the fact that the protagonists of both these films are magicians.  There are also some supernatural or magic realism elements in both films as well.  However, the similarities end there.  This movie centers on Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a famous and fascinating illusionist who is rumored to have supernatural powers and uses them on his magic tricks.  He reunites with his childhood friend Sophie, a young duchess who had planned to run away with him when they were teenagers (Jessica Biel).  They meet again and sparks fly, but Sophie is engaged to the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), who is corrupt and sadistic and has the power to get rid of anyone who gets in his way.  Leopold, suspicious of their mutual affection, uses Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to find ways to get rid of Eisenheim.  Will Eisenheim and Sophie ever be free to be together?<br /><br />This is such a beautiful film.  The setting of Vienna during the turn of the twentieth century is truly breathtaking.  And the backdrop of magic and supernatural powers is just as eye catching.  This film is a feast for the eyes.  I absolutely love the twist at the end and it left me with a smile on my face.  This is a unique, suspenseful love story not like any other love story.  I have loved Edward Norton since watching him in Fight Club and he is absolutely wonderful here.  Biel and Sewell are also great in their roles.  Paul Giamatti, however, is a true showstopper here next to Norton.  He, like Michael Caine in The Prestige, plays a wonderfully complex character and you want him to be on the good guys' side.  The Illusionist has found a place in my DVD collection.  This is a must-see and a must-own for sure.  I love The Prestige for its dark theme, and I love The Illusionist for its magic and passion.  These films are similar and different at the same time, but one thing is for sure: they are both 100% recommended!</p></body></html>

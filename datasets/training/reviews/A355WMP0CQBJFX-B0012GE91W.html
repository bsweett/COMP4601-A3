<meta name="summary" content="THEY JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER AND BETTER!"></head><body><p>oh that harry potter and his crew. the trio does it again. they're back in the order of the phoenix, a little older, and better than before. beginning at the end of the last film. harry filled with sorrow, and changing and feeling things he can not understand. he returns to school where things don't get any better. he reunites with old friends, but still he feels alone. plagued by dreams, and taken over by anger he doesn't know what to do with. his old friend dumbledore is keeping his distance from harry causing him even more frustration. this is no more about small things, this is a more darker, and thrilling film. more dangers, more villians, and more magic. some are back to help and others to destroy. for example, dolores umbridge the new teacher of the dark arts who refuses to teach defense magic. instead planning to take over hogwarts and driving everybody mad. she gets to a point where you just want to ring her neck a few times. she's an evil woman, with the looks of a psycho. all of the characters deserve an honorable mention, because the acting and story lines of all are superb. he who shall not be named has returned and he is trying to destroy harry in all the ways. his army of villians is strong and crazy. brilliant characters, both mad and as black as they can get. some scenes are terrific. you get a bit of everything in this one. things are won, some are lost, but nothing will ever be the same. the magic is still there, and in my opinion even better. the fantasy and the way they make you believe there could really be a world such as this is great. you watch it and you get lost for a minute or two and you forget reality. i just wish it would have been a lot longer. other than that i say keep on bringing the witches, the magic, and the the bad guys.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Smashingly Vast Improvement over the first one!!!"></head><body><p>Before watching this movie, I had a great number of expectations.  Disappointed that actor Eric Bana wasn't returning; I thought Edward Norton was going to phone in his performance.  This one gets off the ground running.  We get to see our favorite jade jawed hero in action from the first frame.  Oscar winner, William Hurt, was the perfect General Ross.  Obsessed and out of control, he manages to create a bitter rival in Blonski or the Abomination.  Tim Roth's intensity made the movie work outside the realm of comics.  Although he was much unlike his four color counterpart; it worked!<br /><br />Liv Tyler was the perfect actress for Betty Ross.  It appeared the relationship between Banner and Ross had progressed over time.  What I did admire was the tribute to the TV show, with the opening sequence.  It didn't take a set of Cliff Notes to know how Banner transformed into the creature.  The audience was not left wanting.  I would like to know how the writer and director are going to top this one in Hulk 3?  Will they feature the Leader or the Rhino for the nemesis?</p></body></html>

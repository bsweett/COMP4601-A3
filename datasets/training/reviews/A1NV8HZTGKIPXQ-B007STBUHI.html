Having grossed about $260 million at the box office, it opened the doors for the epic summer film. Not<br />many of the films in years since, has been able to equal the sheer brilliance of Jaws. Roy Scheider stars as a local sheriff who's quaint little coastal/tourist town is suddenly in terror as a great white shark begins attacking swimmers at the beach. In<br />comes Richard Dreyfuss, who plays a shark specialist, who tries to help the sheriff. Robert Shaw is also on hand as a local fisherman who wants to hunt the killer down and kill it once and for all. There are numerous scenes that are classic and incredibly memorable. The shark itself looks undeniably real and is scary as hell. There are scenes that are destined to make your heart beat faster and your pulse to race. Spielberg executes it so well, and gets his actors to deliver such real performances, that it all comes off as very real and believeable. There is nothing more scarier than when it's real and hits close to home. Know what I mean?. This is one of the finest thrillers ever made hands down. It spawned a pretty decent sequel, but then went downhill(fast)with Parts 3 and 4. Jaws is still one of the best movies ever made. Nothing can match the terrifying theme music either. A classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good but not great--it just doesn't quite go 100%."></head><body><p>Spanglish from Director James Brooks is a good film that tries its best to tackle social issues facing immigrants, their families, and the "Anglo American" culture they meet when they move into the United States (or, in this case, out of Mexico into a Los Angeles barrio and then into "Anglo American" culture). It is well cast; the acting is wonderful. Adam Sandler proves he can listen and be the soft, sensitive man that women yearn for; Tea Lioni shines as the tyrannical American corporate wife forced into a motherhood she can't handle from downsizing. However, after all is said and done, the film comes up a bit short of my expectations. Until the last half hour, it seems to move just too slowly. The ending scene between Flor and Cristina just doesn't feel convincing; it has a certain feel to it that seems too rushed and this that leaves you unsatisfied and wanting a better way to end the picture.<br /><br />The film is actually a flashback of a young girl's childhood; we learn her story as someone reads a young immigrant girl's application to Princeton. The girl (Cristina) and her mother Flor (played beautifully by Paz Vega) come into the US, live in a barrio where her mother Flor doesn't have to learn any English and then suddenly are thrust into another culture when Flor needs and gets a higher paying job working as a maid for the Clasky family.<br /><br />Although John Clasky (played so well by Adam Sandler) is doing very, very well in his profession, he is not exactly proactive at home. His wife Deborah (played by Tea Lioni) runs the household--tyrant style! Deborah is not maternal and bossy to say the least. Her lack of faithfulness to John makes her even less likeable. While one major theme of this movie is the trouble caused when two people from two cultures try to get along, another theme is that Flor (now the Clasky maid) and John Clasky eventually become attracted to each other. What happens from there I will leave off for fear of spoiling the plot for you! (Sorry.)<br /><br />Although the Clasky family can help--greatly help--Flor educate Cristina at a very elite private school,  a painful dilemma ensues for Flor: should she hold onto her core Mexican beliefs and identity? Should she accept the Clasky's offer to send her daughter Cristina to an elite private school and take the chance for a better education than Flor could probably afford? A thought-provoking scene with Flor and Cristina ensues.<br /><br />In short, although the movie gives us a few laughs and it delivers great acting, the plot itself is just not enough to sustain it 100% of the way. There may be disagreement, too, between viewers: does Flor make the right decision about Cristina and the private school?<br /><br />What's the bottom line? I would recommend this film for its entertainment value and the performances by the actors. If you're looking for another great immortal classic like Gone With The Wind, however, you won't find it here.</p></body></html>

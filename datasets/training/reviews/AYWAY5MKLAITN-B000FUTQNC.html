<meta name="summary" content="Firewall Goes up in flames."></head><body><p>This movie is, sadly, the product of many movies before it accomplishing the same thing in much little time and effort. I'm seriously dissapointed with this movie becuase I had such high hopes about it. There were a lot of things that peaked my interest but they all got dragged down by several things. I will admit that the movie had a strong cast, impressive techno-skills on hacking, and great stunts and general stuff like that. But when you combine the dry performances with the recycled plot; it just feels like same stuff, different characters. Why? Becuase we have all seen it before in other thrillers.<br /><br />Within the movie, there are heavy chunks of wooden dialogue and tense moments shoved in between. Not to say that it wasn't acted well, but the lines of dialogue seemed forced rather than articulated. The story, although new, has little to do for today's audience.<br /><br />Plus, in all honesty, the movie is, dare I say, Long. Too long. And if that isn't the bad part, it's also that the movie ended so abruptly. What you are left with after watching this movie is a small eye spasm in why it took so long to make.<br /><br />Plus, one thing that totally turned me off to the whole Firewall movie is the fact that they were giving away free copies like they needed to get rid of it. Also, the main villian, is supposedly this super-savy villian that is a professional at his vouyeristic criminal activities . . . yet he can't figure out how to turn the volume up on the tv with a simple remote control???<br /><br />The bad guys are predictably bad, the good guys are predictably good, and the plot is predictably predictable.<br /><br />Rent it if you want. Just don't own it.</p></body></html>

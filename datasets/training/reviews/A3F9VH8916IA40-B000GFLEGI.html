<meta name="summary" content="Romero at his best"></head><body><p>I Loved Romero's previes zombie movies, of which day of the dead was the best followed closely by night of the living dead with dawn of the dead coming in last(so sue me it wasn't as good as the others).land of the dead beats them all. In the story the world of the previes movies has been completely over run by an army of undead zombies with humanities last survivors safe behind the walls of a fortified city. To survive, they must leave the safety of their city to gather suplies.but in the outside world once known as earth, the zombies are evolving.<br />  If your not already a zombie, horror, or disaster movie fan I don't suggest you which this film. Go rent bambie 2 or whatever it is you wimps watch. This movie is jam packed with gore and flesh eating zombies that the faint of heart might fineD disturbing. So if your man enough and don't throw up at the first of blood, go to your nearest wall-mart (or whatever place that sells movies) and pick up a copy of George Romero's Land of the Dead.</p></body></html>

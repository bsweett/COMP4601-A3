Maniacally twisted, grim, and intense psychological mystery"></head><body><p>***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Finishing watching this for the 5th or 6th time today, I learned yet another piece to the puzzle of this movie which put it together in a way that blew me away as much as the first time I watched it.<br /><br />I can go in depth into the reviews and how good the movie is, but that's been done already to death.  I'll explain to you still confused how this movie works, starting from the true beginning<br /><br />- All the black-and-white scenes come before the movie... Leonard is already on his journey attempting to find John G. and being lead by Officer Gammell on the phone (Teddy).  He finally finds the "John G." guy, a drug dealer called Jimmy Grant, and kills him.  It's revealed now that Teddy has already helped Leonard find the killer of his wife the year before, but since then he has only been using Leonard's condition and his need for vengeance for his own shady means---he set up Jimmy the drug dealer by pretending to have $200,000 worth of methamphetamines for sale, and planning to steal the money for himself.<br /><br />- Leonard realizes Teddy's plan, and distracts Teddy by throwing his keys in a bush, then he decides that if Teddy is going to be making him chase around John G.'s or James G.'s as long as possible for his own benefit, he's going to chase his own John G.... Teddy himself.  So he writes himself clues about Teddy, by writing "Don't believe his lies" on the back of his photo, and tattooing his license plate number on his body.  Thus Leonard is plotting revenge again, but not against his wife's murderer as he thinks, but against the guy who's been using him to kill people.<br /><br />- Thus the color scenes begin (unveiled in reverse in the movie) in which Leonard is trying to follow the clues to John G.  Teddy (the John G. Leonard is after) is trying his hardest to throw Leonard off course, and to get him to give up.  He then encounters Natalie, and she finds out that Teddy was involved in her boyfriend (Jimmy Grant, the drug dealer)'s death, and attempts to use Leonard to try and kill Teddy.  She doesn't realize he is already attempting to "find" him and kill him, as he set himself on this course to begin with (before losing his memory at that moment)<br /><br />- There must be some sort of ability for Leonard to remember things and his memory distorts these things the way he thinks it.  The big clue to this is when he tells Teddy that "memory can change the color of a car, it can change the shape of a room" and concludes with the true beginning, when Teddy reveals to him that there IS no "Sammy Jankis" as he thinks... the character he's been talking about throughout the movie was a fraud, and had no wife, whereas the story of his disillusioned wife was actually Leonard's wife, and that Sammy was actually Leonard.<br /><br />Really this was truly a unique film, and spellbinding.  It's so complex, you can't watch it only once.  You learn something new with every viewing.<br /><br />And the film also has a very very dark, grim aspect about it.  Aside from the fact that he can never live a normal life again, he can't trust anything or anyone, and he doesn't even realize he's a murderer, and will never remember that it was he who set himself against Teddy after learning that Teddy had been using him for his own selfish purposes.</p></body></html>

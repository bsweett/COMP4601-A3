<meta name="summary" content="Lots Of Hype, Rants & Raves....But At The End Of The Day, It's Just Okay!!"></head><body><p>I think it was some time after the 2010 SAG Awards when I first heard<br />about this movie, which, until then, was basically unheard of by anyone<br />but the most devoted film buffs and Hollywood insiders.<br />In fact, it had already been released to DVD by then without too much fanfare.<br />Curious as to why this film had gotten past my radar and was<br />obviously getting all these raves, rants, and hype from the Hollywood machine,<br />yet nobody had really seen it, I went out and rented it from a local redbox vender.<br />I watched it and was immediately taken with Jeremy Renner's intense and renegade performance,<br />but outside of that, I also noticed that the film really had nothing to propel it beyond that!<br />The supporting cast, though some of them had their moments,<br />were basically forgettable in most of what they did.<br />The plot was kind of loose and non-exsistent in some places.<br />It also seemed kind of choppy to me...like a lot of ideas and scenarios<br />which were explored, some more to fruition than others, and kind of<br />spliced together around the only REAL SOLID performance, which was Renner's.<br />I'm not saying this was a BAD movie.....it's JUST OKAY and that's all!<br />This past weekend when it won for picture of the year, best director, etc.<br />I was sitting in my chair saying to myself.....Hmmm, oookay!! (-:<br /><br />Now I think that Jeremy Renner deserved his nomination and I hope to see him<br />in some other, better written and put together films with actors who<br />are more of his caliber to play against.  That should be good.</p></body></html>

Thinking about it, of all the great great grandmaster directors, I mean all of them from Fellini, Kurosawa, Lean, Kazan, you name 'em, when you take into account the sheer volume of films each has directed, and that are truly good and not just catalog fillers, Hitchcock is far and away the greatest director who ever lived. And of all the great films he's done, from his early British stuff like the 39 Steps and Jamaica Inn to his more mainstream commercial pop films like The Birds and Psycho, his greatest film and artistic masterpiece, among the 70 something films he's done, is Vertigo.<br /><br />Vertigo features Mr. Stewart as a cop who is forced to retire because of a condition called acrophobia or a fear of heights that results in the death of his partner. He reluctantly agrees to do a little investigative work on behalf of a friend whose beautiful wife played by Kim Novack is supposedly possessed by the 100 year old ghost of an unstable young woman who committed suicide.<br /><br />I won't divulge any more of the plot for anyone who has yet to see the film. I will say that I am not sure If Vertigo is not THE greatest film ever made. Everything, the cinematography, the acting, the locations (all around San Francisco), the color, the music (by Mr. Bernard Herrman), etc. etc. This is why the medium was invented. Pure escapism. In none of his films is Mr. Stewart cooler than in this film. Kim Novack is incredible playing 2 roles, but I won't be tempted to disclose what those roles are, you have to see them for yourself. As in most of his films, 90% of them, Hitch makes his customary cameo in this film but you can't blink or you'll miss him.<br /><br />I really can't say this is THE greatest film simply because there are so many films. The film it's most compared with is Citizen Kane and seeing it for the first time in years this is a pretty fair comparison. I'd call it a toss up because I couldn't subordinate one film under the other, both are the epitome of filmmaking of the period in which they were made, films that we can appreciate today, but, unfortunately, films that fewer and fewer of us can appreciate with the advent and growing popularity of formulaic films that depend heavily on 3d and cgi. But Vertigo is one-stop shopping if you're looking for the ultimate movie experience.</p></body></html>

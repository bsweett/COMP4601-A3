<meta name="summary" content="A very particular set of head-bashing skills"></head><body><p>This movie seems to be a big DVD hit, and for good reason.  Taken is a return to some 1980s-type revenge movie antics, with Liam Neeson fitting into the hero role where we often expect a more musclebound star.<br /><br />If you've seen the trailer...you know where it's going.  Neeson is some kind of ex-CIA operative, a "preventer", whose daughter is kidnapped about 10 seconds after landing in Paris.  Using some spare info she gave him on a long distance mobile phone call, he travels to Paris, and within minutes is cracking heads.  The villains are a band of Albanian kidnappers who grab travelling girls and sell them into prostitution.  Neeson single-handedly takes down a good portion of the crew in the course of this film, wiping folks out with chops to the throat, bullets, and even a makeshift electric chair.<br /><br />The movie is pure audience manipulation, and you'll be rooting for Neeson to bash heads with glee.  The daughter and her airhead friend are helpfully stupid, immediately talking to strangers who work for the kidnappers, Neeson's ex-wife is appropriately awful, and the ex-CIA-guy-as-Superman cliche is amply employed.  The movie is very brisk, has several action set pieces (including at least two car chases filmed like car commercials, of course), and knows that you know it's getting ridiculous but not letting up.  Neeson is very convincing as a calm, collected, demolition man who knows all sorts of random, McGuyver-esque tricks and barely breaks a sweat as he chases cars on foot, takes out a dozen guys in a minute, and breaks all manners of bones and heads, while wrecking parts of Paris, to track down his daughter.<br /><br />The American version was surprisingly rated PG-13, even with Neeson taking out about 30 guys, and with the plot of international prostitute smuggling cheerily explored.  The Extended, Unrated version adds some more gunshots and chops in, and indeed is less jerky since you could tell things were cut to get the softer rating.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of fast-paced, man-on-a-mission revenge flicks, this is great for repeat viewings, and very ripe for sequel or even franchise potential.  They'd be crazy not to explore Neeson whooping some other gang-du-jour in a prequel or new episode where his puppy is kidnapped.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Boss From Hell!!"></head><body><p>Geez, Meryl Streep is phenomenal in her role as the editor-in chief to elite fashion magazine "Runway" and plays the perfect boss from hell. I can't imagine any other actress for this role! Also nice to see actress Anne Hathaway mature as an actress and move beyond "The Princess Diaries".<br /><br />This movie is fast paced, humorous, and a total chick flick at heart. I loved every second of this movie.... Sure its no Oscar Nominee, its not meant to be anything other than just pure entertainment.</p></body></html>

I had heard plenty of buzz about this film for years, but only recently saw it. At many points, I think the viewers are as perplexed as Leonard Shelby. Leonard Shelby(Guy Pearce), searching for his wife's killer, has a rare condition that doesn't allow him to remember certain events. Events are remembered only in a haphazard way, and, for this reason, he uses notes and pictures as an aid for his memory. What makes the film unique is simply the way it is told, using a non-linear or chronological way of telling the story, but rather scattered and fragmented bits and pieces of time through the point of view of Leonard. We have 10-15 minute segments that reveal events and partial memories, and we are constantly rewinding and fast forwarding to a slightly different version of the plot. It's a bit jarring at first, and difficult to follow, but it doesn't alienate the audience, and eventually the viewer is able to pick up on this type of narrative. Give Nolan credit for pulling off such a film and having very few inconsistencies. Several key characters could make or break the case in Leonard's search, but his reliance on scraps of paper and notes only give him partial, vague clues about who to trust. Therefore, from Leonard's point of view, the line between friend and enemy is always indistinct. Memento somehow manages to mimic its storyline with its film techniques, with scattered clues here and there, and is a cerebral whodunit experience for the viewer to try to piece together. It is also a unique, stylish, film that has great pacing and building suspense, and finishes with a nice twist. Just the kind of film for those who are sick of the same old, same old that Hollywood spews out. As far as the extras, they were so-so, hence the 4 star instead of 5 star rating.</p></body></html>

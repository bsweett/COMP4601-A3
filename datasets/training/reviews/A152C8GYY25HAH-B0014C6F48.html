<meta name="summary" content="Garner shines in [and nearly saves] lackluster fantasy"></head><body><p>I try to be unbiased when reviewing movies. When I watched "13 Going on 30", I tried to avoid obvious comparisons to 1988's "Big". Both movies are about an adolescent who wakes up suddenly being years older. So what? There are only so many stories out there. And, "Big" is about a guy, while "13 Going on Thirty" is about a girl. It's a given that women are more accepting of "Guy things" than men are about "Girl things".  Thus, the derisive term `chick flick'. [The idea of a `guy flick' is socially okay.] It occurs to me that Hollywood has a harder time of making a movie that appeals to women that it does to men. The era of women picking what movie to see is long gone.<br /><br />The truth is that "13 Going on 30" is not a very good movie. It has a few brilliant moments, but it bypasses some really interesting themes to settle on a very predictable love story between the two main characters.<br /><br />The story starts with a nerdy girl looking forward to her thirteenth birthday party. The equally nerdy boy next door is there to help her. The `cool' teens she invites conspire to ruin her big event. Crushed, our heroine [Jennifer Garner] wakes up to find herself 30 years old, just as she had `wished' she could be. She discovers that she is an editor at a trendy fashion/style magazine in Manhattan. The boy next door is now a photographer, while her childhood nemesis [the one who ruined the party] is a co-worker and rival.<br /><br />Ms. Garner, who also stars in the hit TV series, "Alias", is the main reason to see the movie. She is bright, funny, likeable and attractive. She is the driving force in all the memorable scenes. In the old days of Hollywood, she would have been groomed as a star, ala Carole Lombard, Doris Day or Rosalind Russell. In today's world, she is an actress who takes a movie role or two in her `summer vacation' from her TV work. Perhaps when her series ends, she will become a formidable movie presence.</p></body></html>

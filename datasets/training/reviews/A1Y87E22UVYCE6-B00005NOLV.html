<meta name="summary" content="Serious Monkey Business."></head><body><p>"Planet of the Apes" (1968) was the first step of a long series that profited from its success. Not one of the subsequent installments or the recent high budget remake can be compared with this very good sci-fi movie.<br /><br />The story is as follows: a spaceship after a very long voyage crushes on an Earth-like planet. The surviving astronauts soon find themselves inserted in a strange world. Here humans do not speak but monkeys do and have a civilization of sorts.<br /><br />Human are enslaved by the apes and treated as savage beasts. Taylor, the main character, is momentarily mute and can't demonstrate his intelligent condition. He is thrown into a cage with his human kin.<br /><br />The Ape society is stratified in a rigid class system: gorillas are the military, chimps are scientific investigators and orangutans are politics and judges.<br /><br />A couple of chimps sympathizes with Taylor and try to prove his "apian intelligence". The "monkey establishment" tries to discredit them and afterwards to eliminate this "anomalous" human. Conflict and adventure follows in a great action movie.<br /><br />Charlton Heston as Taylor gives one of his best performances almost without clothes.<br /><br />The technical crew is of superior level. The makeup was ground breaking. A team of specialists leaded by John Chambers did a great work.<br /><br />Director Franklin Schaffner proves his skill that will be soon revalidated in "Patton" (1970) and other films.<br /><br />Photography is in charge of veteran Leon Shamroy ("Cleopatra" 1963 amongst an extended filmography) is a high point.<br /><br />A very good film for sci-fi fans and adventure lovers.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

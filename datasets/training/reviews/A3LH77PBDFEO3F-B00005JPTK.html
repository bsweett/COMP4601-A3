<meta name="summary" content="2nd ending much better for me"></head><body><p>In high school I first saw the "Omega Man", Charlton Hesston's version of this story. It has remained one of my favorite apocalyptic films, with some pretty wry humor thrown in. When my wife and I went to see this film over Christmas break at the show, I had high hopes, and I was entranced until the final 30 minutes of the film, and then I was what????<br /><br />The movie spent such a long time effectively building sympathy for the protagonist, and then threw it all away by rushing the end. And without giving away the end, the alternative conclusion available on the disk 2 versions, while maybe a bit hokey, was much more satisfying and enjoyable.<br /><br />So my advice is if you are going to buy Legend, get this Two disk special edition</p></body></html>

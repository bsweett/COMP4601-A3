After seeing this film last night I found it to be pretty good. There's no reason to bash this film because it does deserve to be rated moderately. When rating a film I ask myself what the film is giving the audience and what the message that the director is pushing across.<br /><br />Like Sympathy...Oldboy is another film concerned with the theme of revenge but on a first glance, seems a little more straightforward in it's approach. On the surface, this seems like a simple revenge fantasy, but as the mystery of why he was subjected to his confinement unfurls, things become a little more complicated. Lee Woo-Jin, his nemesis is at first a cold, calculating man fixated on destroying Dae-Su, but once his reason for doing so becomes clear, its hard not to feel just a little sympathy for him. Furthermore, Park pulls plot twist after plot twist out of his film makers bag of tricks, but manages to keep it from becoming disorientating like in say, Identity and the pace of the film does not suffer for these quiet, analytical sequences.<br /><br />However, what ultimately lets it down is that you get the feeling Park wasn't totally decided on what sort of film to make. Sympathy...for all its flaws had no misgivings about the fact it was a dark revenge tale, but Oldboy cannot seem to decide whether it is a action spectacle or a twisted, Oedipal tragedy. The infamous corridor fight sequence for instance, while fun, seems extremely out of place with the rest of the film and can we really believe that Dae-Su is such a great fighter, when all the training he has done has consisted of shadow boxing? And whoever was in charge of casting should of ask for a second opinion, as Dae-Su and Woo-Jin look to have about fifteen years of age difference between them, when they're supposed to be almost the same age.<br /><br />Aside from that Min-sik Choi gives the performance of that year and potentially his career. As Oh Dae-su, he undergoes a transformation of at least three different persona's, performed almost all of his own stunts and otherwise poured his heart into the movie. I will say `OldBoy' kept me entertain and didn't bore me one bit. It's truly work watching.</p></body></html>

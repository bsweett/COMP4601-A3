<meta name="summary" content="One Photo Geek Who Could Use Some Therapy  And Medication!!!"></head><body><p>This is a very tiring overrated Suspense / Thriller . Robin Williams plays a guy named Sy who works at a One Hour Photo stand. By processing his customer's photos he feels as if he has gotten to know one family in particular and sees them as his "Ideal' Family Unit.Sy takes 90 minute lunchbreaks, daydreams about this family, gives away free cameras and is distressed when he is fired from his job!!! Is this guy a loser or what? Then predicatably his vision of his "perfect family" begins to crumble and he then has what psychiatrists refer to as a "Psychotic Episode" just like his name suggests!!!I give this movie 5 stars because the nice guy at the photo shop where I get my films developed is nothing like this geek. I think so. Gee, I hope so!!!</p></body></html>

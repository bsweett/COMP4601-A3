I don't think I'm remiss in mentioning Sacha Baron Cohen in the same breath as Chaplin, Keaton, Fields, or Sellers.  I haven't laughed so hard at a movie since "This is Spinal Tap" in 1984.  Not since Mel Brooks ("The Producers", "Blazing Saddles") have so many sacred cows been skewered in such an innocent and inoffensive way.  Credit Cohen's Borat, a gentle soul even when spouting out politically incorrect platitudes.  The beauty of this film is that you don't know what's scripted and what's improvised.  It's also a terrific piece of Americana.  I was surprised that political and religious conservatives like Bob Barr and Alan Keyes participated in this flick.  Who says Republicans don't have a sense of humor?  Kudos should also go to Pamela Anderson for allowing her persona to be lampooned.  I'm still crying Gypsy tears of joy.</p></body></html>

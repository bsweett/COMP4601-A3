<meta name="summary" content="So bad it's actually quite entertaining...(spoilers aplenty)"></head><body><p>I didn't see any ads etc for this so it was all new to me upon first (and rather likely last) viewing. Unlike most reviewers here, the alien sex scenes didn't bother me a bit, but merely confirmed how irredeemably goofy this flick is.<br /><br />In fact, I'd wager that we'll be seeing more human/alien sex scenes in the next few years, so you might want to acclimatize. We're getting more and more hints in the media that not only may there be life out there in the trillions of planets (gosh, what are the odds?!), but who knows? Maybe WE are already alien/simian hybrids! It would certainly offer one of the few viable explanations as to how we're the only species on earth that reliably destroys its environment over and over. Remember that speech by Mr. Smith in The Matrix about how humans are a cancer on this planet? He might be a little too accurate.<br /><br />In any case, to me the alien sex scene was a whole lot less disturbing than what we see on the news every night. My tax dollars killing hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians...now THAT is truly disturbing. Whereas this movie is fiction. Our actions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam and elsewhere are not. It's fascinating how we've been conditioned to regard massive violence and military massacres as no problem, but we can't even see a pair of breasts on tv without freaking out about morality...even alien breasts that don't really exist.<br /><br />But beyond all that, Splice fails on so many fronts. The script misses endless chances to explore the ethics of interspecies gene splicing, the acting is weak at best (thought Sarah Polley had us hating her character pretty early on; she's very good at being annoying), and the pacing is mixed. Despite all that, we were entertained by it all, bad and good. It's shot pretty well, has a few amusing moments, and did hold our interest (even if it was just disbelief). Brody adds little, but Dren is quite entertaining...I like how she suddenly reveals whatever genetic accoutrements she needs, from wings to gills to a fully-loaded interstellar credit card (but only on the European dvd version).<br /><br />Dren was what made this worth sitting through, for me, and the concept raises enough questions and few enough answers to really make one ponder what is Right and what is Wrong...and if there even is such a dichotomy anymore. In fact, the best part for me was the ending (big spoilers coming); it makes perfect sense (and gets us sequel-ready) that the non-Heroine gets pregnant by an alien with her own dna...that's a near perfect metaphor for modern life! We're so far up our own butts we have no idea what's "right" any more, and you can bet that we'll be seeing interspecies slicing any day.<br /><br />In fact, it's almost a sure bet that the military is already doing it in their various black ops, and like I said it's also a fair bet that we are all carrying non-terrestrial dna around as well. We seem to give first use of all new tech to the military, so who knows how we'll first learn of it...a fake alien attack to promote a one-world government? Now there's a movie just waiting to be made.<br /><br />All in all, I'd recommend Splice if you enjoy bouncing all sorts of concepts around in your head, and are willing to withstand weak acting and writing in exchange for the chance to ponder many imponderables. Because what was once imponderable is now quite within the realm of "reality", and despite Splice's many failings, it raises plenty of thoughts worth thinking. The blu-ray has a good transfer, btw, and its detail shows how good the cgi on Dren was, at least.<br /><br />And to all you folks who were omg SO grossed out by the alien sex scene, let me ask you this: if you found out that the only way you could cure your child of a fatal disease was by someone, even you, having sex with an alien...might you not suddenly reconsider your moral stance? Stem cell research is but one step away from that, and one thing we've proven as a species is that when it all comes down to it, it ain't all for one and one for all, it's one for one. We're a mighty selfish bunch, and who knows what lines we'll cross to preserve our all-important personal dna...wherever it might be from.</p></body></html>

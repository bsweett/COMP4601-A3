<meta name="summary" content="A good film with a great message words can't describe."></head><body><p>Jodie Foster was the perfect person for this role although I felt the reason it seemed somewhat awkward is because we are not used to seeing her as a victim who's lover has been dealt away with. She's had a good run of late and has done some very good films. Flightplan. I quite liked, among other films I thought Inside Man was good although her consequence to the plot is limited, Panic Room was a great film. It's 2008 and she's 45 and she looks 45. There is an element of fearlessness I see in Jodie Foster which truly comes out when she acts in films such as this one. I'll stop being POP TATE and will get to the chase.<br /><br />The Brave One starts with an accident, drags for 10-12 mins, features an amazing performance from the ever-so-improved, Terrence Howard (from the amazing CRASH and the recent good film called "Air I Breathe"), Naveen Andrews has a small role and I couldn't help but notice how well he fit the part and looked it. The storyline isn't much that but there are several instances where human intricasies are bought out. For instance, there is this one scene in which the cop asks a person who just enters the police station to have a seat and offers a kind word. He later offers exactly the same kind word and greeting to the other person and so on. I think it was remarkable how that was done. I found the one scene in which the young man describes Jodie Foster pretty funny but that's the only scene in the film I'd call funny.<br /><br />If you're watching THE BRAVE ONE at the theater, you can't help but share the resentment and downright hatred the central character feels towards degenerates that often flog streets of the urbs and subway trains. There was definitely a lot of imagination involved in the abilities of one single woman but the particular subject matter had to be dealth with. My review says one can't quite describe in words the message of the film but I'll give it a try.<br /><br />This film talks about an often over-looked downside of a city. Festering in small corners are unhappy, unyielding, morally dwindled lives that are what society terms as troublemakers. I dislike degenerates immensely. There is a world that exists and police, law and order, mafia, protection can do nothing about it. But a gun and a heavy heart can or rather might.<br /><br />I'll stop meandering. You will relate to this film if at any stage of your life you have felt helpless. It is for that moment we replay in our mind, always cringing, but wishing we had done something or said something to the trouble maker.<br /><br />Pretty good film. I'm not feeling very generous so ignore the three stars now, will you.</p></body></html>

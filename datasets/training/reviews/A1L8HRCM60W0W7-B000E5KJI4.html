<meta name="summary" content="SOMEWHAT CAMPY AND SLOW-BURNING, BUT QUITE WATCHABLE.."></head><body><p>It's long. With a lot of material smooshed in a hurry. This blinding pace is set at the very outset, when the preamble text flashes some hard-to-read fonts in quick scattershots, so we begin the film with a muddle of Greek names we don't quite grasp, much less care for. <p>Once we do get into it, there are bouts of overacting and just campy cheese as the purpose and background of many things go unexplained. <p>The whole episode of capturing of Helen of Troy happens in a blink, before we have been told who's who. Helen, btw, the very raison-d'etre of the entire Trojan war is some pan-faced damsel about as expressive as a cardboard, a horrid glitch in casting, and she not once makes a dent in our emotions. <p>Come to think of it, Eric Bana and Peter O' Toole are the only decent actors the film sports, and both of them are sadly under-rationed their bit of screen time. Brad Pitt is wooden and Hollywood poster-boyish as ever, although towards the end he does show that he can muster a tear or two. <p>But the war scenes are superbly done. Especially some episodes such as one-on-one combat between Hector and Achilles (Bana and Pitt respectively), plus a few war strategy themes. The oceanside looks suitably spectacular (Malta?) so the imagery guys get a nod from me. I still marvel at how such huge crowds can be hired for stunts, as not all of it is CGI. <p>War is wretched business, but unlike recent farces like "The Last Samurai", this movie shows what true warfare used to be like -- there was honor among thieves and even bloody wars followed rules. <p>A couple of not-so-overt themes stood out to me: <p>(1) ATHEISM:<br />The emperor of Troy commits not one but two blunders by listening to his pretentiously pious minister whose holy crap about Apollo was almost always misguided. On both these occasions some common sense was at hand too, from the emperor's own sons, and ignoring them was catastrophic for Troy. Makes one wonder if there was an agnostic message hidden somewhere.<p>(2) MESSAGE DENOUNCING WILD ABANDON:<br />Achilles has a heroic dialog with his cousin where he (ill-)advises the latter to "don't waste your time following some fool's orders". This advice instigates the cousin to do a wild turn in the war and get himself killed. Anyone see what I see? <p>It's stuff like this and some mildly amusing remember-me lines such as "War is young men dying and old men talking" that make the movie a worthy investment of your time. Don't expect quite a classic but it's decent popcorn entertainment for the 3 hours it takes to make its point.</p></body></html>

I'll go ahead and drop this spoiler: there is hardly a whiff of any of the above.<br /><br />George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer in Hawai'i whose family is partially descended from King Kamehameha. Although they're now "about as Haole as you can get", the family still has the rights to a beautiful and large tract of prime real estate on Kaua'i. As the movie opens the family is contemplating a big decision: the rest of the family are not successful Honolulu lawyers and selling the land will set up the rest of the family nicely.<br /><br />But the real estate plot plays in the background for the main storyline. As the film opens Matt's wife is in a coma that occurred in a boating accident off Waikiki. The Doctor tells Matt in the opening scene that it is hopeless - Elizabeth King shows no evidence of brain activity and her living will instructs everyone to discontinue life support. The Doctor tells Matt to let everyone know so they can say good-bye.<br /><br />This begins an emotional Odyssey for Clooney's character. There are two King Daughters: Ten year old Scottie, played by Amara Miller, who is acting out and having difficulty at school after Mom's accident, and seventeen year old Alexandra, played by Shailene Woodley, who was apparently having difficulty before the accident. Alex has been shipped to a boarding school and she is none too eager to reconcile with Dad or cut Mom any slack just because of a little coma. Robert Forster is realistically gruff and bitter as the father of comatose Elizabeth - he blames Matt for being a neglectful husband - driving Elizabeth to the thrill-seeking lifestyle that resulted in the accident.<br /><br />In his quest to let family and friends know they need to say their final farewells to wife Elizabeth, Matt discovers information that causes a seismic shift in his view of his dying wife and of the real estate deal he has been working on for months.<br /><br />In this portion of the film special notice goes to Beau Bridges as Cousin Hugh who represents the "you're not going to let down the WHOLE FAMILY are you, Matt?" side of the King clan, and Nick Krause as Alex's friend Sid, who shows that in Hawai'i, where type A personalities are as hard to find as a snowstorm, you can't always judge a person's intelligence by their appearance or demeanor. Sid looks like any of the Beach Bums on the North Shore, but in a few telling scenes he offers Matt invaluable insight.<br /><br />Clooney well-deserves his Oscar nomination for his performance. Matt was never a man of action, and in this film there are a few moments where he specifically chooses NOT to act. In the audience we can see his pain, and we know there are times that a lesser, more vindictive person would have escalated the proceedings with a "Springer-Style" knock-down drag-out. But this isn't that kind of movie, and I'm grateful to have not been dragged into the viewing mud.</p></body></html>

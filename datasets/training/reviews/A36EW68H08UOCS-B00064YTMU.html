<meta name="summary" content="5 Star film with 3 Star Ending"></head><body><p>Tom Cruise is good in this movie and his role as a hit-man is a real departure - he is convincing as a ruthless killer.  Jamie Foxx is REAL good in this movie and in a few scenes he shows the acting ability that took him from playing comic roles to his show-stopper as Ray Charles.<br /><br />I'm going to take as a given that you've heard a thumbnail of the plot: Foxx is a taxi driver with unrealized dreams, Cruise gets into the cab in the second scene and forces Foxx to drive him around to a series of hits during the night.<br /><br />In one brilliant scene Foxx is forced to enter a den of hardened criminals and pretend to be "Vincent" the hit-man.  He is initially terrified - realistically - but as he realizes his very life depends on his ability to seem a callous assassin he undergoes a remarkable transformation in a few moments.  Foxx steals this scene: the best in the movie.<br /><br />Until the final act there is not a flaw in the movie.  The first hour and fifteen minutes are good and compel you to the ending, but once you arrive there a few formulas kick in.  When Foxx is forced to accompany the killer I was reminded of Ethan Hawke as Denzel Washington's "good cop" partner in "Training Day".  In both of these films you suspect that the ethical character is going to be brought to a situation where not only his life is threatened, but also his ability to "stand up" and "do the right thing."  If Collateral had stuck to this track and realistically resolved the conflict I'd have awarded 5 stars.  I don't want to give away the ending, but Cruise's character survives an unseatbelted tumble in a flipping high-speed taxi crash, then a shot to the head, and keeps coming as if he were "The Terminator".  "Fargo" and "Pulp Fiction" made getting a shot to the head look like a painful, bloody thing.  "Collateral" makes it look like a good boxing punch.  Still, worth seeing, and Foxx probably deserves a "Best Supporting Actor" nomination for this film as well as "Best Actor" for "Ray".</p></body></html>

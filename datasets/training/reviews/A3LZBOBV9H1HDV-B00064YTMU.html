This is Tom Cruise's best movie and performance of his career, and is also Jamie Foxx's best movie and performance of his career. Michael Mann's direction is brilliant and this is his best movie ever since "Heat" (1995). Tom Cruise plays Vincent and Jamie Foxx plays Max, whose lives are changed in just one night. Vincent is an assassin hired to kill 5 witnesses in one night and he pays Max $600 to drive him around to the places he needs to go to and an extra $100 to bring him to the airport. Tom Cruise has never done a character like this, until now, and I still like him, because he is a likable guy and has played likable characters. It was a challenge for me to decide, whether or not, that I liked Vincent, but I did, though, even if, he is a bad guy, in some senses of the word "bad". Rounding out the cast is Jada Pinkett Smith as Annie, one of the 5 witnesses that Vincent has been hired to kill, Mark Ruffalo as Fanning & Peter Berg as Richard Weidner, two cops who are involved in the case. Bruce McGill as Pedrosa, An FBI agent who is also involved in the case. Irma P. Hall as Ida, Max's mother, & Barry Shabaka Henley as Daniel, another one of the 5 witnesses that Vincent has been hired to kill. They are excellent and well motivated. Stuart Beattie's story and screenplay is brilliant and well written and also well crafted. The music by James Newton Howard is excellent and well synthesized. There is also additional music by Antonio Pinto, Tom Rothrock & Zachary Koretz, which is also excellent and well synthesized. The cinematography by Dion Beebe & Paul Cameron is brilliant and well shot. 80% of the film was shot on digital video, which makes it looks better. The film editing by Jim Miller & Paul Rubell is excellent. The casting by Francine Maisler is excellent. The production design by David Wasco (who production designed "Kill Bill Volume 1" (2003) & "Kill Bill Volume 2" (2004) is brilliant and well designed. The art direction by Daniel T. Dorrance is brilliant and well crafted. The set decoration by Sandy Reynolds-Wasco (who decorated the sets for "Kill Bill Volume 1" (2003) & "Kill Bill Volume 2" (2004) is brilliant and well decorated. The costume design by Jeffrey Kurland (who designed the costumes recently this year for "Hidalgo" (2004) is excellent. The hair and make-up on Tom Cruise's Vincent is brilliant and at times, you can't hardly recognize that it is Tom Cruise. This is a well crafted and well made movie with Oscar written all over it. Tom Cruise (Best Actor), Jamie Foxx (Best Supporting Actor), Michael Mann (Best Director), Stuart Beattie (Best Original Screenplay), James Newton Howard (Best Original Score), Dion Beebe & Paul Cameron (Best Cinematography), & David Wasco (Sandy Reynolds-Wasco & Daniel T. Dorrance) (Best Art Direction - Set Decoration), are potential Oscar nominees for next year's Oscars. This is an mesmerizing masterpiece.</p></body></html>

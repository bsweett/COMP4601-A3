This happens with a good director, its like with a good book you don't want to put down. The movie is engrossing, even when you know the answers to questions you still get caught up in the mystery and allure of the film. The acting flows with the style of the film. The two actors fit well with the overall mood of the picture. It is a classic and provides adventure in a clever and stylish way. The films color is also top notch! Don't miss this great movie!<br />Lisa Nary</p></body></html>

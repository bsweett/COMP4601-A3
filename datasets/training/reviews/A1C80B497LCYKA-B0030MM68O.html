<meta name="summary" content="FASCINATING AT FIRST; THEN BECOMES TEDIOUS"></head><body><p>The Hurt Locker is an almost docudrama about a bomb squad in Iraq; but specifically one soldier named SFC William James (Jeremy Renner), and his delusional take on life and his job. Slanted, anti-war and almost anti-military, I felt this film by director Kathryn Bigelow was almost an insult to our men and women in uniform. It is fascinating for the first hour as you watch these men do their very dangerous work in a very hostile environment; but then it becomes tedious and almost boring as they get drunk and beat the hell out of each other on their time off. Rated R for violence and language.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></body></html>

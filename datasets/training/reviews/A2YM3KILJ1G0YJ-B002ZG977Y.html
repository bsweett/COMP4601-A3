Unfortunately, this version almost makes me want to retaliate upon the filmmakers like the gods smote the people of Argos in the original.<br /><br />The story is essentially a Cliff's Notes version of the original, with Perseus (Sam Worthington) saving the citizens of Argos after they angered the gods by destroying temples and statues.  He embarks on a heroic quest, heavy-handedly aided by the gods - because his dad just happens to be Zeus (Liam Neeson) - to save humanity from the wrath of Zeus, unleashed via proxy by Hades (Ralph Fiennes).  If he is unsuccessful, the city's only option is to sacrifice princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) - no fault of her own, just a result of her mother Cassiopeia's ignorance and arrogance - to the Kraken, a sea monster unleashed by Poseidon.  During his journey with some soldiers of Argos, Perseus gets gifts and hints from not only his father, but the beautiful Io (Gemma Arterto - HUGE upgrade to Bergus Meredith), another demigod stuck in the middle of the story.<br /><br />As with many movies recently, dialogue has taken a backseat to special effects and action sequences.  There's a watered down heroic thrust to the movie, and no real incentive for Perseus to save Argos, much less Andromeda; all he wants is revenge on the gods, and the people of Argos are an afterthought.  This is a major flaw considering Andromeda was the driving force of the original quest, and here she's merely window dressing.<br /><br />I think the special effects are the deciding factor for this film.  All are stupendous, but at points it's subtraction by addition.<br /><br />At times the original Pegasus flew straight out of Napoleon Dynamite's notebook, but the 2010 version is outstanding!  A major upgrade.  Each scene trumps the next, convincing the viewer of not only the scene's reality, but fluid movements suggest that a winged horse actually exists.  Great special effects.  The best, however, is clearly Medusa.  Snakes for hair, sinewy muscle, a lethal bow and arrow, a gaze that turns men to stone.  The combination was enough to leave children with nightmares in 1981, and every facet was improved upon.  Add in a sinister laugh and an upgraded crib replete with chasms, razor-sharp stalagmites, "liquid hot magma," and the result is one of the scariest supernatural villains ever to appear on film.  (It's just too bad that she's so easy to kill in both version of COTT)<br /><br />On the other hand, the Kraken feels much too extra terrestrial, maybe a bit too Cloverfield for my tastes.  A better option would have been the original Kraken's look with updated FX technology.  For me, the Kraken was a disappointment, but not nearly as bad as the witches.  Ahh...The Stygian Witches, wise sages, toil and trouble, cauldron and bubble, all that jazz.  Their appearance is not nearly as appealing as the original version.  Rather than looking like wise, tormented, evil witches, the new version, once again, looks like alien triplets.  Finally, the completely awesome scorpions.  Perhaps the coolest subplot of both films, the giant scorpions form a dangerous obstacle for Perseus and his fellowship.  The problem with the remake is the scorpions' lethality is minimized when they are turned into nothing more than Clydesdales after an epic battle.  And I'm not even going to discuss Jar Jar Djinn.  Horrible!<br /><br />Verdict: If you fondly remember the original, wait for the rental.  If you don't remember or didn't like the original, you'll probably love this.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></body></html>

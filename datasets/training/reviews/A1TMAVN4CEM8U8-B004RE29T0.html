<meta name="summary" content="The Most Plausible Horror movie I've ever seen"></head><body><p>Alien  DVD<br /><br />When I first watched Alien in the 1970's, I thought it was the scariest, most plausible  horror movie that I had ever seen.  Not that I thought that particular creature would ever be real, but something that Mankind had never met up with might be out there.  Heck HIV Aids was barely heard from then.  It came from Africa.  Who knows what might be lurking in space.<br /><br />Anyhow Sigourney was "hot", the action fast and furious. A true delight to watch.  I'd invite people over to the house just to watch the movie and get their reaction.<br /><br />Alien is, quite simply, one of the best movies ever made in both the sci-fi and horror genres.<br /><br />The film hasn't aged a bit since it came out in the 1970's. The DVD is great too, with excellent picture quality and a really great commentary track<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Science Fiction, horror movies and horror classics.<br /><br />Gunner January, 2007</p></body></html>

Four grown brothers who were adopted by Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanigan) when they were delinquent youths reunite in Detroit for their mother's funeral. The eldest is Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), a lone wolf with street smarts and a real violent streak. Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) is a family man with plans for a business who stayed in Detroit. Angel (Tyrese Gibson) is an ex-Marine. And the youngest is Jackie (Garrett Hedlund), an aspiring musician who lacks the toughness of the others.  Evelyn was shot to death in a convenience store robbery. But when the brothers find out that her murder may have been premeditated, they set out to find out what happened and to avenge their mother's death. As the brothers rampage through their way to the culprits, police Lieutenant Green (Terrence Howard) is conducting his own investigation.<br /><br />"Four Brothers" seemed to me a relentless violent rampage in which no one's behavior was redeemable or made any sense until I realized the film's structure and themes are similar to that of a classic Western. The brothers represent vigilante justice in a story about revenge, corruption, and a violent battle of wills and wits between 2 opposing forces. It's a masculine tale in which men fight over a wrong done to a woman, Evelyn, who remains foremost in their memories. Assuming you don't mind that the protagonists unquestioningly embrace brutality as their method of operation, whether the situation calls for it or not, the trouble is that the brothers lack depth and are completely devoid of ethics or any code of conduct. They think of no one but themselves and their own loss, which sets this apart from Westerns.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg shows off his star quality as the leader of the pack. Tyrese Gibson is undeniably charismatic. Outkast member Andre Benjamin is certainly a convincing actor. Director John Singleton draws on 1970s cinema for the visual style. But these characters are only sporadically thoughtful, and their actions, no matter how hair-raising, are not interesting. There is a glaring error in the brothers' ages. The youngest, Jackie, was adopted at age 16. Bobby is at least 10 years older. The boys could not all have been in Evelyn's household at the same time. That may be a casting problem, not a script problem, but it's sloppy.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2005): Bonus features include 4 featurettes, 9 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer (2 ? min), and an audio commentary by director John Singleton. "The Look of The Brothers" (10 min) talks about creating the look of winter in Detroit in Hamilton, Canada and Evelyn's house on a soundstage with director of photography Peter Menzies, Jr., production designer Keith Brian Burns, and costume designer Ruth Carter, among others. "Crafting Four Brothers" (10 min) interviews writers Paul Lovett and David Elliot about the characters and the action sequences, and John Singleton talks about the brothers' relationships. In "Behind the Brotherhood" (9 min) producer Lorenzo Di Bonaventura and the cast talk about Singleton's direction and each other. In "Mercer House Shootout" (4 min) special effects supervisor Neil Trifunovich explains how he created the shoot-out sequence. In the audio commentary, John Singleton provides a scene-by-scene comments on the choices he made, including technical details, performances, story, and editing. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.</p></body></html>

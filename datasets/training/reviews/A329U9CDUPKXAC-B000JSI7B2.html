<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>I've always been fascinated by Jack the Ripper so I figured this movie would be great. Too bad it lacked a strong story and good direction. Sure the imagery is beautiful but the characters are often stiff and lifeless. The story drags on a bit. It moves too slow and the ending is unsatisfying. Johnny Depp does not appear to be the great investigator you'd expect in this movie and Jack the Ripper fails to frighten even the towns people. It's not what I expected.</p></body></html>

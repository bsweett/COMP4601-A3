<meta name="summary" content="Tiny Did What to a Stump?"></head><body><p>When I heard thrash/industrial metal musician Rob Zombie planned to lens a hardcore horror flick that would serve as a tribute to the grindhouse/exploitation films of the 1970s, I couldn't wait to see what it would look like. I soon lost interest, however, because after a few promising teasers about what the movie would look like I rarely heard anything about it again. Rumors started to swirl that Zombie had serious problems with major film studios, which apparently took umbrage at his endeavor. In some ways, this hesitancy on the part of big Hollywood studios is understandable: if Zombie really wanted to make a movie like the gorefests of the 1970s, Tinsel town big shots might worry about potential backlash from certain elements of the public. The taboo busting stuff that worked wonders in 1973 would cause horrific cries of outrage in the politically correct, whiny present day. Well, "The House of 1000 Corpses" turned out to be a rather tame production. It hardly invokes memories of "Cannibal Holocaust," "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," or "Salo." Those films possessed the power to sicken and shock, and they still do today. Instead, "The House of 1000 Corpses" tries to hard to reify those honeyed memories of yesteryear without delivering much in the way of gore or great atmosphere.<p>I am not exactly sure how to describe this movie. It seems to be all over the place, dropping references to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and various slasher flicks from the old days. Four friends tooling across the country to gather information about bizarre, out of the way highway tourist attractions stumble upon a stand run by a profanity spewing tough guy clown named Captain Spaulding. We know Spaulding is nasty because he kills two robbers an hour or so before our heroes arrive on the scene. The clown convinces these four bubbleheads to take a tour of his museum of serial killers, and then tells the story about a local baddie named Dr. Satan who did a lot of decidedly unfriendly things to the inmates at a local insane asylum before his sudden demise at the hands of miffed locals. Predictably, one of the kids on the tour loves serial killers and convinces Spaulding to write down directions to the site where Doc Satan met his untimely end. Within minutes of leaving the roadside stand, the kids pick up a sexy blonde gal named Baby. And right after that the car suffers a flat tire. Are we there yet?<p>Almost. Baby offers to take the kids to her house where a brother (or some sort of relation) will fix the car. Of course, Baby's home contains various fruitcakes: there's Mother Firefly, played with hilarious zeal by 70's star Karen Black, and Grampa Hugo, a rambling basket case who eats with his mouth open when he isn't wowing the crowds with his stage act. Throw in Tiny, a mountainous goon with a face that looks like a lawnmower ran over it and Otis, a guy who looks like the twin of that guy the kids picked up at the beginning of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." There are probably some family members I left out, but you get the idea. This clan should have chlorinated the gene pool generations ago. The house these characters live in is interesting, decked out in all types of junk, dolls, and garbage. The four travelers, of which two are women, slowly come to realize that something is seriously wrong with their newfound surroundings. They are correct in that assumption.<p>That is really about it as far as plot goes. As the movie progresses, this family turns downright mean to their guests. Some of the kids die in gruesome ways, with one turned into an oddity called "fish boy." One girl manages to survive the ordeal after a lengthy underground encounter with zombies and Dr. Satan himself. There is enough screaming, running around, and generally wackiness to hold a modicum of interest, but the whole exercise tires rather quickly. There just isn't anything here we haven't seen before in other, better films. Even the twist ending has been done to death in nearly every slasher film made since who knows when. Of course, that may be what Zombie is trying to accomplish: he wants to rehash these plot devices in order to pay respect to the horror genre. <p>The best thing about Zombie's film is the campy performance from Karen Black. Even with pounds of makeup and outlandish clothing covering her from head to toe, Black is great. It is nice to see her return to a genre in which she once had a firm stake. I also loved Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding. He cracked me up nearly every time he appeared on screen, and he has some of the best dialogue in the whole film. Sheri Moon does a good job as the giggly Baby, with a voice that sounds like Mariah Carey stuffed in a bear trap. Overall, my problems with the film don't arise from the performances, but from the uneven feel of the film and a lack of unsettling gore sequences.<p>The dearth of gore may not be Zombie's fault. The 88 minute runtime makes me highly suspicious that I watched a cut version. At least the DVD comes with plenty of extras and a few easter eggs. The best extra is a clip of three of the characters in the film doing knock-knock jokes with the same punch line. That Tiny does get busy, doesn't he? If these extras don't do the trick for you, there is a scene-by-scene commentary with Rob Zombie to hold you over. "The House of 1000 Corpses" isn't great by any stretch of the imagination, but it does contain enough interesting threads to make me wonder what Zombie could accomplish in the future.</p></body></html>

Tobey McGuire is doing a bang up job with the role as Spider-man and Kirsten Dunst is so beautiful. The music is great and is right on mark for a super hero movie. The script is very well written and one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time. I highly recommend it and I give it 5 well deserved stars.</p></body></html>

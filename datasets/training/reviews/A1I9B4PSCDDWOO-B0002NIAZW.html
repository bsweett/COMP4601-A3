<meta name="summary" content="Dismal film....."></head><body><p>I wish I can say something super positive to say about this movie but I have to say that this is one dismal film. Directed by Roland Emmerich who also happened to be an environmentist, the concept of global warming causing the sudden appearance of the ice age may sound neat on paper but I think it has much creditablity as a toliet paper.<p>If Emmerich managed to create a great film that is one thing but the film itself lack credidability as the concept. First, the special effects, which overall wasn't all that bad but it does have few major flaws. One good example would be that beautiful space view of ice encrusted Europe, from Norway to Italy. Nice graphics but with the rising of ocean and freezing of the European continent, won't the shore line be drastically altered? If so, why does that ice encrusted Europe still looked like the latest edition of Rand McNally map book? Computer graphic wolves looked like something from one of them werewolf movies. As for actors, they got an unforgivably bad lines, bad dialogues with cliches couple with the fact that they have to behaved so stupid for being such a smart group of folks. Funny how Dennis Quaid and rest of the cast never looked dirty, tired or worn out. They all looked like they just step out of their dressing rooms for a take. Quaid do have a weak 5 O'Clock shadow but otherwise, looked pristine. The kids in the library looked like they had a slumber party. It was also funny how two guys carrying a injured third guy managed to outrun the weather....right...just like in Mummy Returns but that was a fantasy...but so is this! Of course, as one Alaskan asked another in the theater...where are their vapors? Its supposed to be cold but there is no tall tell sign of it by their breath! I supposed they are just supposed to pretend its cold! The movie talked about how the Atlantic currents are affecting the weather. But it doesn't say a thing about the Pacific Ocean, world's largest. It may be an oversight but won't the Pacific Ocean have some influence in off setting the ice age if it was not affected?? Another dumb thing is this...if half of the US was covered with ice, why are all these people running into Mexico? Is Rio Grande River some sort of a magical barrier?? With the ice coming down, won't the Rio Grande be flooded making it almost impassable? It looked most of the southwest, Texas and deep South reminds free, why do people and our own government run to a foreign country when half of our own still remain untouched???<p>I sure hate to think of the political outcome of this ice age. United States reduced to a third rate status. Europeans becoming the homeless trash of the world and Third World nations unaffected by ice age taking over world leadership. <p>This is a silly movie, badly scripted, badly directed and badly concepted. Instead of warning us about global warming, it make the subject into a big joke. I supposed many of the undemanding members of the audience will go for this but the more acute ones will probably see it for what it is, poor movie hiding behind a lot of smoke and mirrors. If anyone who read this want to see it, wait until its on rental. With Harry Potter, Shrek and other decent movies out there, there should be no reason why anyone wants to waste their money on this film....but its your money,eh?<br />(On the bright side, any movie that destory Los Angles can't be all bad!)</p></body></html>

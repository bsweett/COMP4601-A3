It's a thin plot, an excuse to show off its ethnic characters, but it does so hilariously well.  Although there isn't anything about the Portokalos family that we haven't hasn't seen before (the mischievous brothers who pull merciless pranks on their sister's clueless suitors; the compulsion to include three generations of cousins in the immediate family; being devoutly religious; blatant male chauvinism that brands daughters as failures if they aren't mothers by 30, while sons can be bachelors well past that age; that the men cling so tightly to their power, they don't realize how women outmaneauver them with their guile; how women are expected to do only three things - marry Greek men, cook Greek food and bear Greek children), the script has a lot fun playing it to the hilt.  Toula is about 30 and unmarried - not even her family hides how they've given up on her.  Working in her father's caf&eacute;, Toula looks like a premature frump when the story starts (flat hair and glasses that look like they belong on a 9-year old).  Her father is played over the top as a man more Greek than Zeus, Hercules and Zorba rolled up (in a small suburb of tastefully modest houses, the Portokalos home was renovated to suggest the Parthenon, arrayed with columns, statues of the gods and a garage door painted according to the Greek flag; Mr. Portokalos relentlessly challenges others to dream up words that aren't somehow etymologically based on Greek; in case we haven't realized that Papa Portokalos had his roots as a character in some stand-up routine, the script has him toting a bottle of Windex, convinced that it can cure anything from minor burns to psoriasis).  With the help of her mother (Lainie Kazan) and a cooperative aunt (Andrea Martin in another of the flick's over-the-top performances) Toula breaks out of her shell and builds a career for herself.  Remaking herself (her hair and clothes, and swapping her glasses for contacts) Toula falls in love with a teacher (John Corbett from "Sex and the City") and manages to sell him and her family on each other.  While suggesting the ethnic clashes, the film remains breathlessly optimistic, and your face will hurt from repeated laughter.  Wise, knowing and fun, the script and the characters are good enough to compensate for its foibles (yes, somebody does utter the line "it's all Greek to me", but not until the near end of the flick; though set in and near a Greek caf&eacute; in Chicago, nobody ever says "chee-boiga, chee-boiga; chip, chip, chip).  In short, a lot of fun.</p></body></html>

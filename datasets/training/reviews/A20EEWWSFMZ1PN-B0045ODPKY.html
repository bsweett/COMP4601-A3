<meta name="summary" content="Take this film with a grain of Salt and you will have a great time."></head><body><p>I only saw the extended cut and re-watched with the voiceover filmmakers' commentary so I will not be reviewing the theatrical version.  The standard technology at the time of this viewing is in Blu-Ray and I won't waste your time with the description of the technology or presentation differences. The DVD I watched comes with the standard extras (more than most DVD's) and unless you do something the standard coming attractions.<br /><br />Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is being pointed out as a mole (Russian sleeper agent) with a mission. This accusation automatically condemns her husband to death. So Evelyn must go rogue to save her husband and prove her innocence. Yes I know this story is been done before but never as well acted.<br /><br />Will Evelyn be able to track down the culprits before she is dispatched by her own people? And it appears that she still has a good friend on the inside; at least someone willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and that is fellow agent Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber).<br /><br />The film has plenty of action, lots of great background music, and veteran actors that do not overwhelm their character's personalities. You may be able to guess the plot, guess the twists, and guess the outcome as they did not go out of the way to mask these two well. But who cares it's a lot of fun watching the individual characters trying to figure this out for themselves.<br /><br />Watch Angelina Jolie play a similar role as an insider that wants out in "Wanted" (2008).</p></body></html>

I saw this at the theater when it was released and it was a jaw dropping experience! Not only were the FX incredible for the time, but the character development and intense paranoia added to the remake, really made a difference. I am a fan of the original,but this is one of those rare occasions were the remake just might be better than the original.</p></body></html>

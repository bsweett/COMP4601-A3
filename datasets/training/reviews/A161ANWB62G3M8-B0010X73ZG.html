<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant, compelling horror film"></head><body><p>This is a fantastic film. The direction (from the man who filmed "The Shawshank Redemption") is spot on, and after 30 minutes you will find yourself completely pulled into the situation.<br /><br />This is a brilliant and inventive story that has the power to shock, and by the end I was stunned by what had happened. This is suspense / horror cinema of a very high standard.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></body></html>

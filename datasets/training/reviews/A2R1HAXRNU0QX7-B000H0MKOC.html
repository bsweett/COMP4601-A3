<meta name="summary" content="A mild but wickedly smart satire!"></head><body><p>This is a very funny movie that will appeal to smart viewers.  I'm sure you've heard that it's a satire of the tobacco industry, in which a "spokesperson" for big tobacco (played by Aaron Eckhart) twists the words of others, scoffs at science and shows not a whiff of conscience.  He appears on talk shows and wins over skeptical audiences.  He's constantly spinning the truth, always grabbing at a chance to defend cigarettes and smokers.  He's very good at his job...mostly because he's VERY likeable.<br /><br />The fun thing about the film is that Eckhart makes his character sympathetic.  His nerve is flabbergasting and admirable (while he spouts the most ridiculous things, he oozes sincerity.  We know he doesn't believe his spiel, but he sure sells it).  He has a great relationship with his teenage son.  He's whip-smart.  He's funny, but not unbelievably so.<br /><br />The movie is a satire of many things.  Some of the best jabs are taken at the expense of "big" Hollywood, personified by Rob Lowe as a movie-mogul in a kimono, who helps Eckhart seal a deal on some product-placement in a big-budget sci-fi movie.  Lowe is priceless...just seeing him brings on laughs.  It also satirizes "Birkenstock-wearing" liberal politicians (embodied in William Macy).  There are jabs at the alcohol and gun industries.  It's really more about now brazenly industries, politicians, Hollywood, individuals (you name it) will spin lies into truth to help their causes.<br /><br />If you like satires, this will be a treat...whether you smoke or not.  And the movie has moments of real power (the scenes when Eckhart approaches a dying Marlboro Man [wonderful Sam Elliott] with what amounts to a bribe is chilling), plus moments of warmth...such as the scenes between Eckhart and his son, who is trying to get a handle on what dad does for a living.<br /><br />Everyone is great.  J.K. Simmons (a real favorite of mine) doing a spin on his character from Spiderman...just better.  Robert Duvall in a small but fun role.  Katie Holmes.  Maria Bello.  William Macy.  Cameron Bright. Sam Ellliott.  And especially Eckhart, who has found a perfect role.  While he was brilliant in IN THE COMPANY OF MEN...he was also VERY easy to despise.  Here, while his character's actions are quite despicable...he is charming, handsome, smart, well-dressed and vulnerable.  I hope people see the film and start appreciating this guy more.<br /><br />It wasn't a often a laugh-out-loud film.  It's humor evokes smiles, chuckles and knowing "ah-ha's."  There's no slapstick.  But there is the pleasant feeling throughout that you are in the hands of skillful artists who are making a point while thoroughly entertaining you.  I highly recommend the movie!</p></body></html>

Incredible contrast. Amazing colors. This is exactly what HDTV is all about.<br /><br />HD-DVD really got me. I was once a Blu-ray supporter, but now I've got to admit. HD-DVD is simply doing what it was suposed to do: DELIVER!<br /><br />This HD-DVD has no extras because the the focus of this format is (for now) to show the public what it can do. I don't quite agree with that. I'd love the extras. But I also must say that an image this incredible is worth anything. I'm sure future releases will have all the goodies regular DVDs have.<br /><br />Just give me more HD-DVD movies! I can't get enough of it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Witty banter, big guns, explosive battles, and AC/DC on soundtrack - Tony Stark is back for some crazy good times!"></head><body><p>Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, is flying high, at the top of his game, or so it seems.  He's single-handedly managed to shut down the arms race, achieving de facto world peace, and his rivals aren't even close. Or so he thinks.  It turns out he and his father before him have made some hidden enemies along the way to corporate and personal success, and the U.S. military (not to mention nearly every other world power) doesn't like being preempted by a cocky upstart, and won't rest until they own the Iron Man suit or its equivalent.  Add to that daddy issues, frustrations at work with a frazzled overcompensating secretary and a beautiful and dangerous new assistant, and the stage is set for a classic escalation towards a massive climax.  It gets busy, and even goes dark here and there, especially when we see the super baddy evil genius Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), but never loses the playful and comic tone established by Robert Downey, Jr., his best friend Don Cheadle (Lt. Rhodes), and his incompetent archrival Sam Rockwell (Justin Hammer). For me the coolest parts of both films were the construction sequences, that make engineering complex and high power equipment look more fun than video games - as in this one when Stark gets a bright idea and remodels his entire house in order to construct a cool new energy source. Nothing profound, but lots of fun.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton's classic cult movie"></head><body><p>I finally found this movie to purchase on e-bay and have enjoyed watching it ever since. I had to avoid the "DVD scalpers" on this website and I was very glad that I did. This movie is a "stand alone" classic that has turned into a cult movie for some cultures. The story is wonderful and the animation is even greater. This movie is also great for watching from Halloween to Christmas and beyond. If you can't purchase it, rent it. It is well worth the owning.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Eminem Show"></head><body><p>8 Mile is a good movie.  I don't mean it is a good debut for a rapper-turned-actor, or it is a good movie for it's genre, I mean it is a good movie.  I'm not surprised either. I've heard all kinds of word of mouth on this film, but the bottom line is that if Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential, Wonder Boys)<br />decided to make the film he must have seen something.  Whether it was in Emeinem as an actor, or the story, whatever, it works.<p>Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks in Detroit.  He goes by the stage name Rabbit when he is trying to rap, but he has terrible stage fright.  Additionally his girlfriend dumps him and he is forced to move back into his mother's trailer.  Sounds sunny doesn't it?  His motivation is clear though.  He doesn't want to be just another loser from the 313 (the area he grew up in).  His way out is music, that's it.  This isn't Hollywood.<p>The film is "losely" based on Eminem's real life.  From listening to his CD's I can pick some of these elements out, and this is important.  Eminem is good in the film.  He has screen presence, but he did not find some glossy action flick (as say DMX did), or some cheesy fluff (as say Britany Spears did), to make his feature debut.  No, he stayed true to his roots, a smart decision.  Eminem is an angry young man.  Wanna know why?  See 8 Mile.  It may not be entirely a true story, but the point is there.  This is how Eminem, the character, was created.  His real name, like Jimmy Smith, is Marshall Mathers. There is a difference.  Is he shocking? Is he vulgar? Is he violent?  The answer to all these questions would be yes.  If this was your life I think you would be too.  After all, he's not from Commonwealth.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The best sci-fi movie ever made"></head><body><p>Okay I know that the title will get many devouted Star wars fans upset and angry and yell &quot;What do you mean this is better then Star Wars?!&quot;  Well Star Wars just didint capture me.  It was OK in my opinion but not that good.  Now Independence day is a fantastic movie that will hook you in the first minute of playing.  Let me say this right off the bat.  This movie has the BEST movie soundtrack I have EVER heard.  It is incredebly patriotic and moving.  It sets the mood perfectly and grips you the minute you hear it.  It is so good in fact, you might expect it to be blasted over big speakers during WWIII battles.  The special effects are spectacular.  The &quot;fire wall&quot; sequence will scare the bejebers out of you.  You will probably be terrified because you feel so sorry for all the people and annimals who face that thing.  The jet-to-alien fighter sequences are stunning.  They may be the best air attack seqeunces ever.  The story is good and moving and will keep you engrossed to the very end.  The last hour or so are by far the best.  The moments when Jeff Goldbloom and Will Smith zoom up into the alien head ship is just incredible.  The last jet battle is incredeble and extreamly well done.  The music also helps a lot here, with incedibly patrisam and heroic tunes.  Overall this is a fantastic movie that should not be missed.<p>The Good: The BEST soundtrack EVER made (In my opinion) Stunning attack sequences, awsome special effects<p>The Bad: Some moments are too heart grippingly sad and tragic.<p>And the Ugly: None!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rooney Mara is as mesmerizing as her name is bizarre"></head><body><p>Having not read the novel, and only seeing the 2009 version from Sweden, David Fincher's The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo isn't all that different from the previous one. No surprises I mean (other than a different ending), but I did think the cast is better and the whole look of the film is much richer thanks to the director's vision. This is suspense mystery that feels more like a typical drama at times. Be ready to sit back and absorb a huge amount of dialogue with people just sitting around, especially in the first hour, but it does move rather fast after that point. It feels like the 2 hour and 40 minutes that it is, though it doesn't drag quite as much as the earlier version.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace was excellent as Lisbeth Salander, but I like Rooney Mara's performance a little bit more. She somehow manages to make her gothic appearance look odd and attractive at the same time. Her line delivery is fantastic and whenever she is on the screen you simply can't look away. She has already received a Golden Globe nomination, but I think maybe an Oscar could be in her future. Daniel Craig is at his best here as Mikael Blomkvist and a big improvement over the previous rendition of the character. I actually believed his connection with Lisbeth this time around.<br /><br />The brutal scenes that people who have read the book or have seen the 2009 movie know they are coming and are pushed even further here in terms of what is actually seen. If you don't know what is coming, prepare to brace yourself. The lady sitting behind me said "disgusting" more than once.<br /><br />Special mention for the opening credits. A new cover of the "Immigrant Song" plays over black oil colliding and making various shapes and characters in the story. I thought I was watching the next Daniel Craig Bond movie.<br /><br />I have had a trend over the last two years of seeing the most depressing movies right before Christmas. First Black Swan and now TGWTDT. It looks like next year will be The Hobbit, so maybe then I can redeem myself from becoming a total holiday Grinch.</p></body></html>

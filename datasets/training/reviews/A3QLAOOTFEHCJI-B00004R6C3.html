<meta name="summary" content="A fine gory remake of a horror classic"></head><body><p>I'm not one of those people who think a remake is a bad idea.  Once in a while an update is warranted and even successful.  "The Thing" is one of those films.  Director John Carpenter not only revisits the 1951 film but accepts the original story in the novella that "The Thing" has the power to invade Earthly life forms and assume their identities.  This allows Carpenter and his special effects crew to up the ante with regard to creature features and top rate technology as it existed in the `80's.  They don't shy away either.  This movie is awash in gore, goo and globulin.  And just wait until you see the creature!  "The Thing" is much more however.  There are genuine frightening moments, usually centered on the paranoia that infiltrates the camp located in Antarctica.  In a terrific opening scene, we see a helicopter chasing down a sled dog running across the beautiful white tundra (shot in British Columbia).  The dog is being shot at from the helicopter.  We don't understand.  When the dog discovers an American camp, we think all is well.  Surprisingly, the gunman continues to shoot at the dog, wounding one of the Americans by mistake.  He is then shot by the base commander.  An American pilot (Kurt Russell) and a couple scientists search for the Norwegian camp where the now dead gunman and his pilot came from to get some answers.  They find everyone dead and what appears to an icy tomb for some form of life that is no longer there.  The cast is headed by Kurt Russell in full follicle as pilot MacReady. Keith David, Wilford Brimley, David Clennon and Richard Dysart provide supporting roles and should be recognized by everyone who has watched TV since the 80's.  "The Thing" didn't do well at the box office, probably due to Ridley Scott's "Alien" coming out about the same time.  Still, this is an excellent take on an old story made with horror and science fiction gusto.</p></body></html>

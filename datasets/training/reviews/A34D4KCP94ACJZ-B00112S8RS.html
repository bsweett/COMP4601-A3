<meta name="summary" content="Dark, Overlooked, and Full of Outstanding Performances"></head><body><p>Directed by the great Sidney Lumet (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JU7T">Serpico</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NOKJEU">Dog Day Afternoon</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010YSD7W">12 Angry Men</a>), this is a dark heist drama about terribly corrupt people.  Fairly ordinary in its theme these days but Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is remarkably deep in engaging and underrated performances.  The cast includes Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, Albert Finney, Brian O'Byrne, Amy Ryan, and of course the amazing Philip Seymour Hoffman in a role worthy of incredibly high praise, especially considering how unique the role is for Hoffman, who normally plays characters with a small fraction of the presence and confidence he has here.  He is actually intimidating in some scenes which is a far cry from his equally engaging performances in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E33VWW">Capote</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008WI9N">Love Liza</a>.<br /><br />Hoffman is Andy Hanson, an executive of seemingly solid repute, who has embezzled from his employer and is about to be audited.  He needs money to make up for the losses due to his theft.  Either that or he needs money to run far away from the law.  He convinces his brother Hank (Hawke), who is also in need of money for his own reasons, to plan an armed robbery on a jewelry store.  The moral dilemma here is that the jewelry store belongs to and is run by their parents.  The plan fails in ways I won't reveal and eventually leads to various forms of further descent for the two characters.  Albert Finney plays the father of Andy and Hank.<br /><br />Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is shot on high definition video and it is one of the first times I've seen the format used this effectively for a fairly low-budget feature length film.  I guess even at 83 years old, Lumet is still evolving as a filmmaker, albeit the subject matter is still pretty consistent.  He understands the technical end and he has always known how to tell a good story on film.  The quick release on Blu-Ray was also welcome and of course consistent with the move to film on high definition.<br /><br />The story is told in various segments that bounce back and forth in time surrounding and during the events mentioned in the brief summary above.  This was probably done to show the various character's perspectives on the events and was pretty effective for that.  The movie was made on Lumet's own terms and that is something I can respect, but what made it surprising to me was the power of the characters and the performances of the actors in their roles.  It really is a highlight on the resumes of all the actors involved and that is saying something for the likes of Finney, Hawke, and Hoffman. It is dark and has its own pace but I definitely recommend seeing Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.</p></body></html>

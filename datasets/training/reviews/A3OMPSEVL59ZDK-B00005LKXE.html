Gary Oldman was brilliant as Mason Verger and the make up was both gross and spectacular. The film's cinematography, well it seems that Ridley Scott is still &quot;Fast/Dizzy&quot; camera effect happy since Gladiator. Anthony Hopkins loses some charm now that he's free from his jail cell, its just sorta weird I dunno. Juliann Moore did the best she could with a character who's integrity and dignity are stripped in every part of the movie, its not her fault her character is a complete Dunce who is nothing but the puppet of Mr. Lecture. The one thing that took away ALOT of stars for me. was the STUPIDEST ENDING EVER since The Blair Witch Project. Boy was that a stinker, the book ending was WAY WAY WAY better then this crap. I was totally dissapointed by it, and I can in no way forgive such a result for the characters. Had it been better, the movie would have gotten a better review from me. Yes at times it's entertaining, and contains loads of black comedy, with Mr. Lecture acting so cool and childlike just before he rips someones intestines out. Its not that gross, but beware the shock end scene for those who are squemish. It could have been better, once again Clerice Sterling loses everything you love about her from the first film, she's taken from strong and confident to nothing but the play thing of a whole buncha men who have it out for her.</p></body></html>

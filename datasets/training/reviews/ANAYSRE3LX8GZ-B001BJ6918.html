<meta name="summary" content="Worse then the first"></head><body><p>I swore I wouldnt even bother to watch this seaqul to the first god awfull movie, but my old man picked up a copy and there was nothing better to do, and after watching it, I wish I spent the last 2 hours watching paint dry instead!<p>All the hype about how vol 2 was even better then part 1 is the biggest load of B.S I think has ever been contrapted. Was it fans who started that rumour? Or just a way the company made sure people went to see it so it made its money back?<p>The plot kicked off from where the last one finished, and it unveals even more dumb motives and bad fight scenes. The trailer park guy beeing killed by the ever so threatning, tough looking, eye patch wearing assisin was too predictable! But not as predictable as the way Bill is killed! When you suffer through the boring dialog of a flashback of Bill and Uma then you straigh away figure out how Bill is going to die. Note there's no "!" on the end of that! If you cant predict it, theres somthing wrong with you! It was seen coming a mile away!<p>At least the movie didnt have 10 minute long staring compititions this time around, or the mask of zorro gang lead by the fearless leader of no emotion and super-abilty's to stare at nothing Lucy Lu.<p>Kill Bill 2 is a waste of time. It dosent bother me, seeing as how I didnt like either film, but neither film played off each other too good, the first was action filled with blood and voilence, the second was completly long and boring dialog and the action is minimal. The speechs where too long, kind of reminds you of watching the Pro Wrestling and you hear "shut up and wrestle"<p>After vewing Kill Bill 2, I rate it 1, but if there was option to go 0, i'd do that, just to be one below the first movie!<br />The ending is too unbeleiavble, and not satasfying.... this Bill seems to have a myth of beeing some super bad guy, the story that folded out led me to beleive that the whole thing was just one big stupid untought out plot. If maybe Bill was a more sadistic killer who deserved to die, and you felt he did, then you probably would have seen me rate it a bit higher, maybe a half star?<p>Now for await the third seaqull where the little girl from vol 1 comes back to seek revenge on Umas charactor! Tho i write that with sarcasim, it wouldnt suprise me if that ideas's already in the making!</p></body></html>

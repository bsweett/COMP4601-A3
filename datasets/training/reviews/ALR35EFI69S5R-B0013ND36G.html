<meta name="summary" content="The Big Guy Is Back!"></head><body><p>Wow, the big guy is really back, at long last. But this bang-em-up sequel to the sequel was well worth the wait. It is not exactly Academy Award winning stuff, but then again, we are talking about the Terminator here. Sometimes it's a bit hard to find the big guy amid all the pyrotechnics, explosions, and spectacular truck crashes, but Arnold is definitely back! One thing I find amusing, however, is that the basic cybernetic model Arnold plays keeps getting slimmer with each film, but since the original version was likely easier to spot as a machine due to its incredible bulk and muscularity, maybe such a revised this model could blend into human company and pass without being detected. So perhaps the machine makers reconfigured its armature as they went along, explaining AHNOLD's progressively slimmer physique in each film.<p>Anyway, I defy anyone to show me another 55 year old who is this buffed, this muscular, and this awesome! And in the Terminator movies, what really counts here is the combination of special effects and terrific action sequences, which certainly is where the producers have invested most of the effort, energy, and funding. And while I personally was not as impressed with this effort as I was with the superb production values evident in T-2, there is no doubt that this roller coaster ride of an action flick, which includes an eye-popping and heart-pumping sequence with fire trucks racing through the city streets, will enjoy a wide audience and have a lot of success just based on such pyrotechnics. Yet, having said this, in some ways the only continuity with the first two terminator films is the presence of the big guy himself. In this sense it is less a sequel than it is another episode in the Terminator series, and there is a difference. <p>The story is set ten years after the closing of the second movie, with John Connor (played here by Nick Stahl) now a young adult living on the margins of society to avoid detection, existing without an apartment, a telephone, or credit cards. He finds himself being hunted by the T-X, the most advanced model of the Terminator series, a prototype designed with cutting-edge capabilities including being disguised as a female. The T-X is superbly underplayed by the fetching Kristana Lokken, being programmed as a murder machine that dispatches anyone it comes across en route to its intended prey, the clever young John Connor. Enter our boy AHNOLD, an obsolete T-101 model originally programmed as a hunter-killer, but now sent back to rescue Conner so he can prevent his murder so he can survive to become the adult who somehow keeps sending Arnold back to rescue him. Got it? <p>AHNOLD must also save the comely young Kate Brewster, an old friend of John's who The T-101 has been programmed to recognize as an older Conner's future main squeeze. Kate is played well by the ever more attractive Claire Danes, who has a terrific future in the film industry, never mind with young John Connor. So the stage is set for yet another protracted series of uneven battles between the mismatched terminator models, with the T-101 attempting to fend off the T-X while keeping the two youngsters alive in the process. As with the previous movies, there are wonderful one-liners, and some gutter humor that we find ourselves laughing along with despite our better natures. I enjoyed the tongue-in -cheek repartee, which is often witty and funny, and this adds a valuable dimension to this film so often missing from other action-fantasy films. All in all, this is a great evening's entertainment. After all, he told us he'd be back! Enjoy!</p></body></html>

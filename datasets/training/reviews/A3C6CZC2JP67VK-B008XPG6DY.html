After the initial character development and getting to know Charles Schine's (Clive Owen's) character and his family, the story unfolds and suddenly takes full speed.<br /><br /> Personally, Clive at times seems to be miscast in this picture because he looks like he could beat the crap out of somebody, when he isn't suppose to look that way. Jennifer Aniston gives us another showing that she can be a dramatic actress and sheds the "Friends" image that she has had for 10 years. Jennifer is very believable in this role. She handles her tough scene's very well proving to us that she's Oscar worthy, but not in this film. Vincent Cassell ("Ocean's Twelve") and hip-hop artist and producer RZA as Winston both done a great in this film as well as  Tom Conti (so brilliant in "Reuben, Reuben").<br /><br />There are a lot of unnecessary events in this movie that just don't give the plot enough leg to stand on. It's a pretty good mystery that provides a nice twist near the end, but clues and events leading to it (which is obviously the -point- of it) are badly placed, hence making the climax almost every bit anti-climactic. It's hard to believe that Owen's wife would put up with a lot of the nonsense that he pulls to save his skin. To add to that, how the drama ended in the movie was simply unnecessary and a complete overkill. Rome's conspirators might as well have killed Anthony with Caesar.<br /><br />This movie succeeds only on the level of the performances and the effectiveness of the tension in many scenes. It's got a lot of edge of your seat moments, but afterwards when you think about what's happened in this film, you'll be scratching your head.<br /><br />I do recommend this film and I appreciate the way it makes you feel. This helpless situation helps inspire you in the age of divorces and break-ups family that there's still something worth fighting for,and still something worth dying for....</p></body></html>

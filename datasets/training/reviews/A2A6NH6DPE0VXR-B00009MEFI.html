<meta name="summary" content="A too short but entertaining thriller"></head><body><p>Joel Schumacher proves once again with Phone Booth that he's much better at handling more serious movies. He did a good job with Tigarlands and A Time to Kill, Lost Boys and Flatliners weren't bad either. So the guy has talent, you just can't see that by watching Batman & Robin lol. <p>  Colin Farrell (DareDevil, Tigarlands) stars as Stu a jerk who plays people how he sees fit. He thinks he's better than other people and he gets knocked down a big notch. He uses a pay phone to call a potenial actress (Katie Holmes) who he's interested in sleeping with....when he's married. A mysterious and menacing man (Kiefer Sutherland) calls after his call with her from that pay phone telling him not to hang up or he'll kill him. The Sniper kills someone who was trying to get Stu to get off the phone and the cops come thinking Stu did it. Stu has to convince a cop (well played by Forest Whitiker) that he's not the shooter without actually saying he's not. He also of course has to find a way to get out of the phone booth alive. <p>  Phone Booth is an entertaining edge of your seat thriller even if it doesn't work entirely. For instance it's silly that it starts out with a Twilight Zone type narration introducing Stu. The film is  too short and we never learn much about the sniper. We don't learn why he finds the need to interfere in people's lives and try to play social worker....but with a sniper rifle. Kiefer Sutherland is great though even if it is just a voice over role. He's menacing and extremely scary, yet some how even amusing. Colin Farrell is very good as well in a role so many big stars such as Jim Carrey turned down. Farrel does so well making the role his that I couldn't have pictured anybody else in the role. Phone Booth is  short like I said but it does hold your attention the entire time and is still worth checking out.</p></body></html>

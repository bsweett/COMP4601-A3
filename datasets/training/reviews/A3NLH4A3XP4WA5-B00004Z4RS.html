<meta name="summary" content="The comics are better"></head><body><p>A totally mindless film adaptation of Stan Lee's X-Men Comic book series.  This film had me pndering for hours why a director would destroy a perfectly good comic series into an hour and a half of endless idiocy.  The acting was fairly good to start, and the beggining looked almost promising, but then, it dropped off considerably once you hit the first action scene.  This movie may be based on a comic book series, true, but to make a feature length film out of people flying in the air and smashing each other is pointless.  The director did do a good job with the casting I must say though, Ian Mcklellan, and Patrick Stewart save this film from hitting rock bottom.</p></body></html>

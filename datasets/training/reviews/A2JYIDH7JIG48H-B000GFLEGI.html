<meta name="summary" content="More creative than most zombie movies."></head><body><p>This one's at least just as gruesome, gory, and gross as any of the other Dead movies, but also I think a little more creative, with some interesting developments.  Especially developments of and by the living dead - taking up weapons, for instance.  It seems the dead are learning to live normal lives, while the living do so in sin.  I didn't see the previous movie in the series, so I don't know how much of the background and characters were already established, but I picked up enough to understand it all.  Dennis Hopper controls a city protected from the dead, living high in a ritzy skyscraper.  Patrols go out to bring in supplies, fighting zombies along the way.  They have an armored vehicle, which is stolen by one of the men Hopper betrayed.  Another is sent to recover it, and has plans of  his own.  But none of that reallly matters, as the dead are picking up weapons, learning, and closing in.</p></body></html>

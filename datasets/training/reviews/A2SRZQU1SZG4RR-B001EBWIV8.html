<meta name="summary" content="Stunning Visual Effects  But Somewhat Diluted Story Line"></head><body><p>Not having viewed the first "Matrix" film, I had to evaluate this film on its own merits ... which is a good thing, because as I had no basis of comparison, I enjoyed the stunning visual effects and futuristic fantasy concepts without preconceived notions. However, *now* having viewed the original "Matrix", I can see a few flaws in this sequel. Overall, it is the stunning visual effects that are most memorable: fantastic flying scenes, artistic kung fu & ju jitsu fights, acrobatic leaps including walking on walls and ceilings, photographic views of the gears and machines which keep the underground city of Zion functioning. The most important reason for the film's success is the original creative concept of humans entering the computer program called "the Matrix" ... to beat it at its own game, i.e. to alter or change it. This idea *alone* makes the film a block-buster at the box office. The inclusion of martial arts and spirituality add further to the intrigue and mystery of the story line ...<br /><br />Unfortunately, the sequel lacked the depth  of the original theme: Neo discovering "who he is", "finding his own path" and realizing he is "the One" who will challenge and possibly ovecome the Matrix program. The build-up to his decision to seek information from the Oracle was nicely done but the actual meeting was a let down. Another minus to the film is the deliberatley prolonged fight scene with the Agents named Smith. It detracted from the impressive and artistic merits of the martial arts fighting. The car chase scene with the Evil Twins on the highway was also lengthy and too exaggerated . There were missed opportunities to film stunning views of the mountains and valleys of Switzterland, personally I think Neo & Trinity arrived at the Swiss castle looking for the key-maker way too soon ... a more meandering route could have been built up with a creative climax. Also, they found the dungeon in the castle where he was locked up too easily. One intriguing twist in the plot could have been to develop a romantic interlude between Neo & the French mistress of the "god-father". The writers of the film could have explored Trinity's ability to deal spiritually with a "love triangle". The "party scene" after Morpheus' speech to the humans seemed rather primitive. It appeared to trivialize the seriousness of the impending invasion by the machines.<br /><br />Overall, the sequel was good but left *this* viewer feeling the film was hyped up too much. No doubt the Matrix trilogy will change how films are made in the future but it should never be forgotten that technical merit does not replace important themes in a story. Place equal emphasis on *both* and I will gladly see the third film in this series. Erika Borsos (erikab93)</p></body></html>

The film opens with Milk (Sean Penn) dictating, essentially, his memoirs onto a series of cassettes in case he is assassinated. I wasn't quite sure how van Sant was going to work the time factor into this (given how the movie ends--and we all know how it ends, right? If not, be warned, this review may contain spoilers), but he ended up doing it quite well. One can never be quite sure what one is going to get with a Gus van Sant film, but Milk is far closer on the sliding scale of quality to Drugstore Cowboy than it is to Psycho. (And as Captain Peacock was wont to say, "Thank Heaven for that.")<br /><br />The first half of Milk traces the final years of Harvey Milk's life, from his relocation to San Francisco with partner Scott Smith (An American Crime's James Franco) through his days as a political activist to his election as city supervisor. The second half zeroes in on the final weeks, as Milk tries to play politics with rabid antigay conservative Dan White (No Country for Old Men's Josh Brolin), elected supervisor for the next district over on the same day Milk rose to power. Along the way, we get to know the backstories of a number of others instrumental in Milk's rise to power, including Cleve Jones (Speed Racer's Emile Hirsch), who would go on to create the AIDS quilt; Jack Lira (Y Tu Mama Tambien's Diego Luna), whom Milk dated after Smith left him (and who was, in many ways, the impetus for the events of Milk's final days); and Anne Kronenberg (Allison Pill, recently fo Dan in Real Life), who is still involved in San Francisco politics to this day.<br /><br />While the movie does have a plot (and a more compelling plot than a lot of recent movies not based on true stories), it never fails to remain aggressively character-driven, and because of that the movie lives or dies by the performances of the actors involved. Every time I've seen Sean Penn offscreen for the past decade or so, he seems more and more like a personal train wreck (his Oscar speech accepting the Best Actor award for this film was horrifyingly incoherent), but it's been impossible to deny his power as an actor for close to thirty years now. I've loved many of Penn's performances, from Fast Times at Ridgemont High to Mystic River, but for me his landmark performance has always been in the 1983 prison drama Bad Boys. This is the first time I've seen him eclipse that. He absolutely, positively nails this role to the wall. On the flip side of the coin is Josh Brolin, whose career has been the polar opposite of Penn's, from the woeful The Goonies through some of Hollywood's worst disasters in recent memory (Hollow Man, The Mod Squad, Into the Blue). No Country for Old Men was a revelation where Brolin was concerned, and Milk just ups the ante. While saying Brolin has never given a performance this good would be damning with faint praise, I don't mean it like that at all; he is almost as powerful as Penn here. The rest of the principals are equally good at making us love or hate them, depending (Diego Luna is just loathsome here, as he was meant to be). The main cast are helped out by a slew of phenomenal performances from actors in minor roles; 21 Grams' Dennis O'Hara reunites with Penn here as John Briggs, Milk's biggest public nemesis, while Legally Blonde's Victor Garber couldn't be better as George Moscone, the mayor of San Francisco. And they're just the tip of the iceberg; this isn't Cecil B. DeMille, but it's at least a cast of hundreds, and everyone with a speaking role is fine here.<br /><br />The direction is equally stunning. Van Sant's passion for the source material is evident in every frame (he's been trying to get an adaptation of Randy Shilts' biography, The Mayor of Castro Street, off the ground for almost twenty years; it looks as if that may actually happen now). People often say that attention to small details doesn't make a difference in a movie. Maybe in some cases they're right, but I think in this case it's indicative of Van Sant's dedication to the source material; his use, for example, of the real Castro Camera and Harvey Milk's actual apartment may only contribute to the film in an intangible way, but I think those intangibles are reflected in the performances of the actors. (As well, a number of the actual people portrayed in the film have cameos, including Dan White's son Chris, Cleve Jones, and Danny Nicoletta). That has to have some effect on what happens behind the scenes, don't you think? In any case, it's hard to argue with success, and whatever the reason, Milk gives us both a director and a stable of actors who are all on top of their collective game here. Almost unanimously named by critics as one of the best movies of 2008, and I'm inclined to agree. ****</p></body></html>
